aghetti like it’s heavy
Some said he deserve an ESPY, in a Chevy like Andretti
Put the desi where his chest be

[Outro: Crooked I]
Slaughterhouse!

[Intro]
I want a kiss, kiss, kiss
I want a kiss, kiss, kiss
I want a kiss, kiss, kiss
I want a kiss, kiss, kiss

[Verse 1: Royce da 5’9”]
Nickel Nina nigga Twitter beefing, first rapper to shot a fan
Gucci's my absolute state of mind like Waka's man
Choppers spraying, getting head in a car parked, new Gallardo
This bitch sucking my dick today, call it yesterday's news tomorrow
Stretch a nigga out, I'm the new Tae Bo, 'bout to cross over, I'm the new Ivo
'Bout to saves a couple of these bitches
That's right, I'm the new Bible
You? You five-o. Me? I'm more grounded than punishments
But I'm too fly though
Y'all niggas be whining, I should call you Moscato

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Look down at the floorboard
It looks like someone left a pair of stiletto shoes in my Tahoe
Never know just what type of a ho inside of my ride I may let
Last night went to 5 a.m. and she ain't even recover from last Friday yet
Hoes all over the ride like it's an ice cream truck
I can see why they fret
I already ran over two hoes
And I ain't get out the fucking driveway yet
Soon as I open the door you try to resist
What for? Get in girl, don't front, shorty
You're fighting an un-winnable war, it's useless
As tits on a bull or little tits on a whore
Got 'em acting like spoiled brats kicking and screaming
Like little kids throwing fits on the floor
Get in the whip, but you ain't turning this frog into a prince
Why you tryna keep convincing me for?

[Chorus: Female Vocalist and Eminem]
I want a kiss, kiss, kiss
You won't get one
I want a kiss, kiss, kiss
Not from me
I want a kiss, kiss, kiss
Not on the lips, are you crazy?
I want a kiss, kiss, kiss
Maybe the cheek but that's all you gon' get from me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now you in my whip just as long as you understand that I can't be whipped
You say companionship, I say abandon ship
I'm a gigolo, so you know I'm always on the go
I don't got no time to slow down for no relationshit
Drop the P and add a T
Yeah, you can get mad at me all you want
But I'm ghost before you can even say, "Boo," hun, let alone call me one
A one night stand is all he wants with a female fan, yeah, one like Stan
And he's so 'bout a one nightstand
His bedroom has two lamps and only one nightstand
Get the hint?
Ooh yeah boo – ew
I ain't finna argue, but why do you think they call it boo?
Yeah, 'cause the sound of it s'posed to scare you

[Verse 4: Royce da 5’9”]
Oh, ho, we can share you in the back of the McLaren
I don't give a fuck what your name is
We gon' call you "Hi" and "Bye"
Hope you bi, in the meantime your name is Sharon
Slows the flow down so I can what?
Tell you same face I make
When I'm shooting the gun's the same face that I make when I fuck
From the back of my hand on your neck
Pressing your face against these sheets, it's insane
You VIN changed
'Cause I'm outta this world, girl
I got that Milky Way dick vein
I'm at an all-time high with highness
I'm at an all-time fly with flyness
And this is exactly what they say when they bow to your highness, yeah

[Chorus: Female Vocalist and Eminem]
I want a kiss, kiss, kiss
You won't get one
I want a kiss, kiss, kiss
Not from me
I want a kiss, kiss, kiss
Not on the lips, are you crazy?
I want a kiss, kiss, kiss
Maybe the cheek but that's all you gon' get from me

[Verse 5: Royce da 5’9” & Eminem]
Nickel Nina nigga Twitter beefing, first rapper to shot a fan
Push a chick out the car while it's moving like Waka's man
Her bottom's dark, but her top is tan, her private parts
Got her on the pole, like the opposite of her papa's plans
Come on stripper, let's hit the strip, 180, throw it in reverse
And drop the trans, I'm in the trance, now look at this bitch dance
Looking at this tramp like, "What are you wearing, girl? Quit playing"
Yeah, bitch in them scratch and sniff pants
Well let me scratch 'em
Let me sniff, yeah
What? Did I say that? I'm on lean like Styrofoam cups and kickstands

[Verse 6: Eminem]
Middle finger stuck on fuck
Stiff hands, but, girl you got a butt like no if ands
So yeah, what the hell, maybe
All hail Shady, he'll tell it like it is
So tell Katy Perry he's on her tail, he's tailgating
These bells are my mating call and I'm here
Bell's waiting, and tell Lady
Gaga, she can quit her job at the post office, she's still a male lady
Wouldn't fuck her with her dick, you heard it, the verdict's in
He's allergic to divas and take meat cleavers to 'em
Him don't give a damn about beaver do him
What a demon, a behemoth evil just seems to be seething through him

[Verse 7: Royce da 5’9”]
I like the little strip tease you doing this evening
You and me gon' find three more chickadees and have a menage like Nicki
You hot like a Dickie outfit in Texas without shit under it
Sweating, suck my dick or get to stepping's my logic

[Verse 8: Eminem]
My God trick, my dick is hard, as stiff as a yardstick
What are we gonna do?
Ride around 'til we're carsick?
I'ma put this shit in park like dog shit
And you can blow me in the dark
In the parking lot of the trailer park by the garbage
What're you waiting on, me to roll out the carpet?
Condoms are in the glove compartment, let's start it
Think I'm joking?
What, am I sitting here tryna make fake farts with my armpits?
Tryna get you to spit pop through your nose?
Am I here to amuse you? Stop it

[Verse 9: Royce da 5’9”]
I'm in your pocket outside of a church
The other hand reaching for the bottom of your purse
You giving me head in a boxing stance
My dick's so big you could drop it in dirt
I'm not your man, we sparring partners
There's five things you are in charge of
That's: sucking the dick, sucking the dick
Sucking the dick, sucking the dick, sucking the dick

[Verse 10: Eminem & Royce da 5’9”]
And if you ain't sucking a dick, why you sitting there
With puckered lips? Oh that's collagen, muhfuckin' bitch
What you mean how'd you get suckered into this?
You gon' jump into my truck and then try to get truculent
You should be suffering, you should be cooking
You should be buckling your seat belt with oven mitts
Excuse me while I'm making an ass out of myself
But it's only because I just wanna get

[Chorus: Female Vocalist and Eminem]
I want a kiss, kiss, kiss
You won't get one
I want a kiss, kiss, kiss
Not from me
I want a kiss, kiss, kiss
Not on the lips, are you crazy?
I want a kiss, kiss, kiss
Maybe the cheek but that's all you gon' get from me

Nickel Nina nigga Twitter beefing, first rapper to shot a fan

[Verse 1]
Simplified love-sick, taking no prisoners
Sunny day, cold heart, listen up listeners
Dark side love affair out of time and in the rush
You can't hold it until the sun rise settin up
Let's levitate up over the horizon
I can see it in your eyes
Everything you're hiding
I can see the truth in you
Even when you're lying, even through the darkness
I can see you shining

[Hook]
When it's midnight and it's colder
Pull you closer I can see you through
When it's sunshine and it's solar
And it's over it's just me and you

[Post-Hook]
Blood, By, Sun, Light (Blood, By, Sun)

[Verse 2]
A played out love song playing in the background
Seems to describe every part of where were at now
Every feeling that we ever had for each other
Every karaoke love letter, lyrics undiscovered
Now your mother used to tell me you ain't nothin' but some trouble
Now some couple trouble makers making mayhem on the double
Tryna figure out the meaning and break apart the puzzles
Why they love you when I hate you when they hate the way I love you, solar

[Hook]
When it's midnight and it's colder
Pull you closer I can see you through
When it's sunshine and it's solar
And it's over it's just me and you
When it's midnight and it's colder
Pull you closer I can see you through
When it's sunshine and it's solar
And it's over it's just me and you

[Post-Hook]
Blood, By, Sun, Light
Blood, By, Sun, Light (Come on!)
Blood, By, Sun, Light

[Verse 3]
A complicated heartbreak losing its direction
Cold day, warm heart--object of affection
My dark side love affair come to my protection
Midnight's on the way I'm losing my connection
Levitate up over the horizon
I can see it in your eyes, I know that you?re hiding
I can see the truth in you even I know that you're lying
Throw away the darkness, I wanna see you shining

[Hook]
When it's midnight and it's colder
Pull you closer I can see you through
When it's sunshine and it's solar
And it's over it's just me and you
When it's midnight and it's colder
Pull you closer I can see you through
When it's sunshine and it's solar
And it's over it's just me and you
When it's midnight and it's colder (Blood, By)
Pull you closer I can see you through (Sun, Light)
When it's sunshine and it's solar
And it's over it's just me and you
When it's midnight and it's colder (Blood, By)
Pull you closer I can see you through (Sun, Light)
When it's sunshine and it's solar
And it's over it's just me and you

[Intro]
"You're going to be okay kid, you're going to be... okay"

[Chorus: Claret Jai]
Is everything not enough?
What more can I give up?
Is there anyone that I can trust?
I give you my all and you still take from me

[Verse 1: Royce da 5’9”]
Uh, always been the type of dude that'd feed my clique
I know that without the fans, I ain't shit
But y'all better read my lips, I don't spit raps this ill
For you to just hack and steal and leak my shit, so peep my drift
I hope y'all don't think y'all helping me out
With that shit, that shit's stressing me out
Nickel nine is blowin' up; Christmas time
You should hang my album on top of your fireplace
'Cause around that time, my stockin's goin' up
Feels like a victory bittersweet, 'cause the bigger I get
The bigger the wedge between the relationship
Of me and my bigger bro, hear what I said?
Feels like the shit was wished on me
Everything I do for the nigga, and the nigga know
I would do anything for him, but the nigga refuse to quit
Just straight shittin' on me
Keepin' your distance? Probably best
If you don't wanna fuck with me
But you know me probably best, fuck pity, you want that?
You know it's Laila Ali's chest: tough titty
The problem's you got a problem, you think that I'm already set
So I'mma look down on you?
Just be proud of me, you already got my respect
I ain't tryin' to say something I'd regret
So I'mma just stop chasin' the pain
And let you deal with the fact that we don't get along
'Cause I got a big face in the game
Sometimes I feel like fuck my life
I fuck with a few niggas that I know
If my chick was a Shady ho
Niggas wouldn't think twice 'fore they fuck my wife
Guess that's the difference in friends and associates
I done been broke, I done been through the motions
I don't pay no attention to birds
I use my scope and I tend to the vultures
No one ever blows up your phone just to talk
I don't make money just to loan it to y'all
Tell a nigga that then you wildin' is like dialin'
And then talking to a hole in the wall
Please look at these expenses, these niggas expensive
If I gotta lend you money every time I see you
Just to be your friend, bitch, I don't really need your friendship

[Chorus: Claret Jai]
Is everything not enough?
What more can I give up?
Is there anyone that I can trust?
I give you my all and you still take from me
I give and I give and you take and you take
And you just walk away without nothing to say
You just take from me, ay, ay
You just take from me, ay, ay

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I live in a bubble, I struggle with the fame
Trouble is the pain grows double, give a fuck what you say
When my music you take so subtle, just to give it away
To people who don't even appreciate flows, mothafucka
I'm livid today, 'cause I break my back to give you my art
You steal my thoughts, it's like drivin' a spike through my heart
You might not think it's that big of a deal
To steal from me, but music's all I got
Aside from my daughters, not to sound like a martyr
But it's getting harder than I thought
To not just go crazy, trapped in this house
I'm about to just snap
Am I not deserving of what I got, did I not work for it?
Put it all in every record I record, well then
Please tell me why on this Earth, Lord's it keep happening?
I keep rappin', but I wonder sometimes, is it worth all the bullshit?
'Cause it feels like a down there ain’t no gettin' up from
But I won't let it get me down, I won't succumb
I'm anything but glum, so fuck 'em
They'll appreciate me when I'm gone, they'll say it was ill, right?
The way I killed mics? But the way I feel right now
It just feels like I'm so done with this shit that I may as well wipe
I have nothing else to give you, nothing left to contribute
Farewell, I bid you, but before I go, my last gift to you
Ladies and gentlemen, Slaughterhouse, I give you

[Chorus: Claret Jai]
Is everything not enough?
What more can I give up?
Is there anyone that I can trust?
I give you my all and you still take from me
I give and I give and you take and you take
And you just walk away without nothing to say
You just take from me, ay, ay
You just take from me, ay, ay
I'll fuck you up, bitch

Yeah, this is stadium rap
Hotter than the last name on my alias Jack Rip
Bad bitch flip our gymnasiums pack
Track itch shit's dope, y'all should slang it in sacks
Shit's selling for ten harder than elephant skin
Benevolent grin, I stay gold, you settle for tin
Wolf Gang Wolf Pack I got weapons of tens
So take a wild guess as to why they letting us in, please
Earl letting the competitor win
Is the equivalent of stepping with stilletos in gyms
It's not happening so while I'm standin' checkin' your chin
Know the flow takes the H out your shins, fin

[Intro: Eminem & Royce da 5'9"]
Ayo, this next song is a true story (Come here, bitch)
'Cause some things in this universe
Don't make sense
But somehow always seem to fuckin' work

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Flying down I-75, 'bout to hop on 696
I look over, this fuckin' chick's tryin' to fix
Her makeup, I'm like, "Bitch, you ain't a plastic surgeon
I advise ya to put up your visor, I'm gettin' kinda ticked
You're blockin' my side mirror," she's like, "Yeah, so?"
I'm like, "So? You gon' need a stitch you keep acting like that, ho
I look like your husband, slut? That's a rhetorical question
You talk to me like you talk to him, I'll fuck you up
In fact, get in the backseat, like the rest of my dates
No bitch rides shotgun; what? Taxi?
Stop and pick you some Maxi Pads up?
Is that what you actually ask me?"
Bitch reaches over and smacks me
Says I annoy the fuck outta her, get in the fuckin' back
Put on your slut powder, you slut, what?
And shut the fuck up now, or get your feelings hurt
Worse than my last chick when I accidentally butt dialed her
And she heard me spreadin' AIDS rumors about her
Turn the radio up louder, make it thump
While I bump that Relapse CD
Tryin' to hit every bump in that cunt
Thought I snapped back into accents
'Cause she kept asking me to quit calling her "cunt"
I said, "I can't!", she said...

[Chorus: Eminem]
Marshall, you ain't really like that, oh, oh, oh
You're puttin' on a show, where's your mic at?
'Cause you're breakin' my heart
She said, you're breakin' my heart
'Cause you ain't really like that, oh, oh, oh
You're puttin' on a show, where's your mic at?
'Cause you're breakin' my heart
She said, you're breakin' my heart

[Verse 2: Royce da 5’9”]
Uh, pull up to the club in a Porsche, not a Pinto
While Marshall's at a white trash party, I'm at drama central
I walk up in there lookin' at my phone, on Twitter, tweetin'
I'm feelin' a bunch of bitches looking at a nigga, cheesin'
I get approached by this little skeezer, she asked me
Am I the realest G? 'Cause I'm Gucci from head to feet
I said, "Yeah, I'm really is, 'cause I spit in your man's face
Like Cam did that little kid on Killin' Season"
She said, "I'm feelin' your big ego, wait, am I talkin' wrong?"
I said, "Nah, I'm a walkin' Kanye/Beyonce song"
She said, "I'm mad at you," I said, "Why?" She said
"Why you never make songs for chicks as if it's hard to do?"
I said, "I make songs for me, leave the studio, and go
And fuck the bitch who belong to who making songs for you"
She said, "I'm feelin' your whole swagger and flow
Can we hook up?" I said, "Umm, you just used the word swagger
So, no!" She said...

[Chorus: Eminem]
You ain't really like that, oh, oh, oh
You're puttin' on a show, where's your mic at?
'Cause you're breakin' my heart
She said, you're breakin' my heart
'Cause you ain't really like that, oh, oh, oh
You're puttin' on a show, where's your mic at?
'Cause you're breakin' my heart
She said, you're breakin' my heart

[Verse 3: Eminem]
We been riding around in this hatchback 'til I'm fuckin' hunchback
Where the fuck's this party at, slutbag cunt? Cut what act?
Think it's an act? Fuck that, I'm tryin' to shag, skuzz
Better find this love shack or somewhere to fuck at
Ah, don't touch that, you fat dyke!
I'm tryin' to hear some "Bagpipes from Baghdad"
Don't act like you don't like 'em, them accents, I rap tight
And I'mma torture you 'til we find this place, yeah, that's right
Thought it was just past this light, just past Van Dyke
Better hit that map light, read them directions, oh yeah
You can't read, and you can't write, you told me that last night
She took my CD out the deck, snapped it in half like
"Relapse sucked," I snapped, hit the gas like
Blew through the light, spun out, hit a patch of black ice
Forgot we had a trailer hitched to the back, we jackknifed
Bitch flew out the car, I laughed like she deserved it
She didn't think I'd act like that in person
(Royce, Marshall just crashed right in front of the club)

[Verse 4: Royce da 5’9” & Eminem]
Tell him I'll be there in a minute
I'm tryna break up this catfight
Between my mistress and damn wife
Then a chick wanted a hug, she was fat, so I gave her dap
Then I tell her to scat, I'm not mean, I'm cute
On my way to the front door, takin' the scenic route
To avoid this chick with a lace front
Lookin' like Venus's and Serena's hooves
I'm just sayin', them chicks got horse asses, they been attractive
Hope when they see me
They don't slap me with they tennis racquets
My mind drifted, back to this shit: I see my wife push her down
Step over her body, then smack the mistress
Police outside, I turn and pass the gat to Vishis
Then I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin
He mugs the mistress, turns around
And gives the missus hugs and kisses
Looks at me twisted, like Nickel ("Yeah, watch this shit")
He smacks the dentures out of the mouth
Of the fat bitch he rolled with, and looks back to mention
"Royce, it's good to be back to business!"

[Chorus: Eminem and Royce]
They said, you ain't really like that, oh, oh, oh
You're puttin' on a show, where's your mic at?
'Cause you're breakin' our hearts
They said, you're breakin' our hearts
'Cause you ain't really like that, oh, oh, oh
You're puttin' on a show, where's your mic at?
'Cause you're breakin' our hearts
They said, you're breakin' our hearts

[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah
Told you we'd be back
Welcome to Hell

[Verse 1: Eminem]
There's a switch, I flip, emotions cut off
So cold, I done froze my butt off
And this ain't even the tip of the iceberg yet
It's like squirtin' a squirt gun in the ocean, fuck all
Other words, I ain't put a dent in the game compared to the damage I've yet to do
As long as you still have feelings to hurt, I'll be around as long as you let me get to you
As long as I got two balls to palm, I'll be the bomb, you're just a false alarm
Get scant, little piss-ants, and see if I don't come along and stomp your farm
Thunder and lightning, rain, hail, sleet with a tornado's the kinda brainstorm I get
So when wind starts blowin’ shit
Talk about goin’ in? Goin’ insane’s more like it
Wizard of words when he spits hazardous with it like a disastrous blizzard
So you better listen quick fast don't miss it
Yeah, go ahead, little, prick bastard, diss it
But when you get hit with a sick-ass explicit flow
Don't ask how much of his passion is it that goes in it
Just know that all he knows is that it's better to kick ass than kiss it
Dick Dastardly of audacity
Mental capacity, unmatched it has to be stopped but it can't be
But man I can't just keep doin' 'em like that or no one'll rap with me
Except one—you asked who is it?

[Verse 2: Royce da 5’9”]
Guess who just came through to blast you bitches?
With the ratchet, the book of Matthew, a book of matches
Lighting 'em under white linen
You 'bout to have to admit it
They pass you the mic, asked you, spit it
And you got handed your own ass, your ass in your own hands
I'm sure they gon' laugh when you're going to the bathroom with it
Now with what would you come against us?
Better be somethin' with a Bigfoot pedigree
Easily, these are the reasons that we need to be in y'all prayers
Each region breeds them, MCs that wanna be the remise
That they wanna breathe our air, with these ideas
Anybody thinkin' the game don't need the Bad and the Evil regime
That's like saying that the Bad Boy Piston team didn't need Isiah

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Shit, piss, and bleed, this is a different breed of MCs, I swear
Better beware, there's too much at stake and to find someone this raw on a beat is rare
You can kiss my ass and eat shit stains out my underwear that I don’t even wear

[Verse 4: Royce da 5’9”]
This gotta be no fair, it's like hitting the lottery, oh yeah
Who you know hotter? There gotta be no pair
Shotty that I got'll lobotomy your hair
Classic, smash it, smother it, read it and weep then
Perhaps you will have no rebuttal and
In fact, you seein' me in this rappin' is like saying
Tila Tequila can sing like Jazmine Sullivan

[Verse 5: Eminem]
Back to bash your skull again, push a bitch out the Aspen
And tell her get the fuck outta Dodge (Dodge Aspen)
Shouldn't have to explain my metaphors
You has-beens are duller than color books that ain’t colored in
Second and third, fourth wind, got another wind
Here they come again, none other than Bad and Evil
Also known as Saddam and Osama Bin
It's been a long time, but I bet that neither one of us
Have felt sicker than we do right now
And we only get iller with time
Me and Nickel fuckin' shit up on the dime
So telling us to pipe down is like talking to a meth head
Bruce Willis on his death bed, last breath with an infection
Fightin' it while he's watchin' internet porn, 'bout to meet his death with an erection
My God, what I mean is David Carradine jackin' his penis in front of his tripod, choking his own neck
What part you don't get? I'm saying I die hard!

[Verse 6: Royce da 5’9” & Eminem]
When you listening to my bars, nothing but the F-I-R-E
Coming out your iPod, we come up in a place
Chicks heads start spinnin' like motherfuckin' white walls
Got your mother suckin' my balls while we fuck each other, we punch each other in the eyeballs
And I never say, "I'm so–rry," the 5’9” and the Fire Marshall
We spit with an intensity to shut shit down
In the industry, two different entities with a propensity
To put these N-U-Ts up inside of your fuckin' mouth

[Outro: Eminem]
Aw shit, stop it
Yo, welcome to the CD

[Trey speaking]
You know sometimes in life
When you, when you’re going through things
You’re having problems
You just wanna know how to live that
Let the top back ride with a beautiful woman, you know what I mean
I know some of you are like: fuck no
I know what you mean and I can feel that but ay

[Hook]
Ridin’ to the music
This is how we do it all night
Breezin down the freeway
Just me and my baby
In our ride
Just me and my boss
No worries at all
Listening to aston martin music, music

[Hook]
Girl I would have came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I can't let it go
Whether that’s right
I will never know

[Trey Songz Verse 1]
Should I go back to the woman
That had my back at the moment
Before the moment when everybody else got on it
What if I was stuck in the hood
Rolling skinny blunts
Doin’ hand to hands
Baby seats and strollers in my mini van
Who the fuck am I kiddin’
This how I’m livin’
Different cities every day
Boy you know it’s different women
See i’m growing as a business
And I’m sitting on some millions
Missing Thanksgivings
Got the bank flippin'
You don’t understand my reality is different
Addicted to this life yet life’s what’s missin’
Yeah, let that manifest man i’m just in another world ridin with you girl

[Hook]
Ridin’ to the music
This is how we do it all night
Breezin down the freeway
Just me and my baby
In our ride
Just me and my boss
No worries at all
Listening to aston martin music, music

[Hook]
I would have came back for you
I just needed time to do what I (got a lot of shit going on) had to do
Caught in the life I can't let it go
Whether that’s right
I will never know

[Trey Songz - Verse 2]
And listen I figure it’s only right
That I been getting to this money
‘Cause I feel like for so long
They have been trying keep it from me
So many different women tell me that they love me
I just tell them keep it
From me
‘Cause that picture could get ugly
Passionate as ever but my heart is tough as leather
See the pain in Tremaine
Sometimes bury the pleasure
But whatever
Cheddar, I was raised be about it
Say you can’t leave with it
But I can’t be without it
Yeah I think that I’m the shit all the time
If you don’t then do you, that’s some shit you need to get off your mind
You don’t think that you’re the shit can’t sit in my ride
That’s why I keep a bad bitch in the ride

[Hook]
Ridin’ to the music
This is how we do it all night
Breezin down the freeway
Just me and my baby
In our ride
Just me and my boss
No worries at all
Listening to aston martin music, music

[Hook]
I would have came, would have came (yes I would) back for you
I just needed time (I wanted time, wanted time) to do what I had to do
Caught in the life(caught in the life) I can't let it go
Whether that’s right
I will never know

But here goes nothing
Aston martin music, music
Aston martin music, music
Aston martin music, music

[Intro]
Girl, I understand why
See, it's burnin' me to hold on to this
I know this is something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm tryna say is that, I... love you, I just...
I feel like this... is comin' to an end
And it's better for me to... let it go now
Than hold on and hurt you
But I gotta let it burn

[Verse 1]
It's gon' burn for me to say this, but it's coming from my heart
It's been a long time coming, but we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out, but I don't think you're gonna change
I do, but you don't, think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurtin', baby, I ain't happy, baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you (No, no)
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through
Let it burn (Let it burn), let it burn (Let it burn), gotta let it burn

[Verse 2]
Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here, but I want you
'Cause the feelin' ain't the same
Find myself callin' her your name
Ladies, tell me, do you understand?
Now, all my fellas, do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I know I made a mistake, now it's too late
I know she ain't coming back
What I gotta do now to get my shorty back?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Man, I don't know what I'm gonna do without my boo
You've been gone for too long
It's been fifty-leven days, umpteen hours
I'ma be burnin' 'til you return (Let it burn)

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn (Let it burn, let it burn, you gon' learn)
Let it burn (Gotta let it burn, oh), gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else
But you know that it's over (Know it's over), we knew it was through
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn

[Bridge]
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry, ooh
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Can you feel me burning?)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So many days, so many hours
I'm still burnin' 'til you return (Let it burn)

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn (Let it burn, let it burn), let it burn, gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through
Let it burn (Let it burn, let it burn, let it burn)
Let it burn, gotta let it burn

[Intro: Claret Jai]
Get outta here!
The poor stays poor, the rich get richer
It’s just so disproportionate

[Chorus: Claret Jai]
Sometimes life seems so unfortunate
That's why I don't give a shit
The poor stay poor, the rich get richer
It's just so disproportionate
You don't know just what I go through
That's why I would rather show you
Just how far that I can take it
Every rule, I'm breakin' it

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Terrible, but not rip-able, invincible, I hung invisible
Fuckin' mistletoe all over the world, I stuck my ass up under it
Now pucker up them lips and kiss it, hoes
Here we go, Bad and Evil so you know how this'll go
The competition's miserable, we stomp them bitches this is no
Joke, goin' overboard like someone threw us off the boat, choke
Cough from all the smoke, I'm tryna stay on fire
So you know if I hate fucking water sprinklers
I don't love the hose
Someone let the cat out the bag, now it's time to stuff its face
Back in that bitch, smother that little
Motherfucker 'til it suffocates (Who?)
You had long enough of a wait, why are they
Tryin' to be so secretive? Bad and Evil is reunited, hey!
Came back to annihilate, the game's in dire straights as I await
Word on Satan as I drop, fall to my knees before this
Ouija board and I pray, now I lay me down to sleep
I do this shit in my sleep, I’m sleepin' now, imagine if I awake?
I'm champ, bitch, I'll never taste the canvas
Could never be no damn wuss or pussy
Never mushy, so you can't squish
Nowhere near a tush, in fact if I jump out a bush
In a sneak attack's, the only way I'll say I am-Bush
Outlandish, these words are weapons that I brandish
Stand-offish to hoes, keep your hands off this
Can't top it, so what the fuck would I sugarcoat it for?
Law? Fuck protocol, I'd holla at this ho
But now my throat is sore

[Chorus: Claret Jai]
Sometimes life seems so unfortunate
That's why I don't give a shit
The poor stay poor, the rich get richer
It's just so disproportionate
You don't know just what I go through
That's why I would rather show you
Just how far that I can take it
Every rule, I'm breakin' it (Royce!)

[Verse 2: Royce da 5’9”]
Baby, I'm lawless
You couldn't burn me if you threw acid on me
I'm at ya, homie, I'm at your home ready to spray you
While you nappin', homie, have everything on and around
Your mattress lookin' like the word in front of a matrimony
You high, thug? Yeah, go 'head, jump, no matter how high you get
You gon' come up short like Spud Webb
My DUIs get waived like sayin' bye
Still ridin' with no L's like James Todd, can't change, I
I thank God for my safe thinkin', last time I was safe thinkin'
Me and my niggas was doin' a bank job
I stay violent, y'all go the peace route
You got a mouth like Kanye
I'll knock your whole bottom row of teeth out
No disrespect to Mr. West, shit, I'm just nice with mine
And this just rap, I'm just like Ricky Hatton, I just like the line
These weak rappers want to set us up, they never tough
They ask me for a hook, I tell 'em, left or right? Head or gut?
What y'all messin' with is a nigga that'll leave you FUBAR
Fucked up beyond all recognition
Y'all are rock stars, I'm the opposite, I could just
Throw a rock and hit a star for the fuck of it
Partner, you're not hard, I body your hot bars
Beef is left you pray, right like Allahu Akbar
Let's go, when I leave y'all shot, you ain't gon' be on your Metro
In a bad area that call dropped

[Chorus: Claret Jai]
Sometimes life seems so unfortunate
That's why I don't give a shit
The poor stay poor, the rich get richer
It's just so disproportionate
You don't know just what I go through
That's why I would rather show you
Just how far that I can take it
Every rule, I'm breakin' it

[Verse 1]
I turn the music up, I got my records on
I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone
I feel my heart start beating to my favorite song
And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
Until Monday morning feels another life
I turn the music up, I'm on a roll this time
And Heaven is in sight

[Verse 2]
I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble, sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop
Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
As we saw, oh, this light
I swear you, emerge blinking in to
To tell me it's alright
As we soar walls
Every siren is a symphony

[Chorus]
And every tear's a waterfall
Is a waterfall, oh
Is a waterfall, oh-oh-oh
Is a, is a waterfall
Every tear
Is a waterfall, oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
So you can hurt, hurt me bad
But still, I'll raise the flag

[Outro]
Oh, it was a wa-wa-wa-wa-waterfall
A wa-wa-wa-wa-waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall
Every tear, every tear
Every teardrop is a waterfall

[Hook]
We had no
(diamond in the back)
There was no
(sunroof top)
But we was
(diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean)
(diamond in the back)
We had no
(sunroof top)
But we was

It ain't no

There was no

Diamond in the, diamond in the, diamond in the...

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
I know it' preliminary
But I see me and my visionaries
On our military taking it over...
Even if it's temporary
We can lift and carry the windy right upon our shoulders
Oh Yes the coppers they watch us, they tap us, they trace us, they lock us
But we free so what's that supposed to mean?
Bingo, no higher, them tires, that bentley on 20's is spiffy, it's done by 310 altering
I wanna get one just like it and customize it and ride it
CTA take me where I need to go
I bet its going to kill em to see me wheelin' the villain through c-h-i-c-a-g-o
And Ima pimp her right past the United Center
Western California, Kedzie when I'm traveling
This for my niggas, my homies, my partners, my players that's posted up on Madison

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
One time, two times
For my niggas thats locked up on 26 and California currently up under incarceration
I try to tell em be cool, dont be no fool
Think of your good behavior, don't get in no altercation
That way we can chill and get ill in a brand new set of wheels as soon as you post bond
And thats for Muelers, two for each of us
That's like a watch a wrist so that we can tell time on both arms
Thank God for this gift I got that I have
We went from Aldi's bags and boxes up to Dominics
Pockets full of brown dollar bills
I got skills but some Jordans could sure build up my confidence
So I can strut, stop, pivot lean, side to side
And gracefully transmit it from hood to hood, block to block, ride to ride!

[Hook]
(diamond in the back)
It had no
(sunroof top)
But we be
(diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean)
We had no
(diamond in the back)
There is no

But we be
(diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean)
Even without no
(diamond in the back)
Or no
(sunroof top)
We be

If you ain't got no
(diamond in the back)
Or no
(sunroof top)
You can be

Diamond in the, diamond in the, diamond in the...
Gangsta!
West Side!
Uh this goes out to you(you) and you(you) and you(you) and you
Oh listen

[Verse 1:]
To say im egotistical
Is so stereotypical
If I say im the shit then baby you can be my tissue roll
Girl you like a toostie roll
How many licks do it take till it stick to my face(I wanna know)
45 46... 50 licks
Got somewhere to go so can we make it quick
Not a quickie though
Have faith like Biggie though
We in the chase for that Diddy dough
I should make a sex video
Way I'm hitting hoes
They be singing opera like figueroa figueroa figueroa
Yea singin' nigga from the ghetto
Ain't nothing like a pretty woman in stilettos
(Yeaa) Sex Olympics, I won a medal
Girl you need to ride no brakes no pedals
Yea I'm drunker then a motherfucka
Even when I'm drunk tho I'm hotter then these other bustas
They say I'm wrong for saying that
(Well)But shit you wrong for saying that
I'm sick of dos equis
You so petty
I'm so ready
Once had a akward moment only cause I wanted to
Middle finger my opponents
Baby girl I'm zoning
And I really give a fuck if you was on it
Song called bedroom cause you featured on it
Satin sheets bed room I'mma beat you on it
They say my head big
Cause my head is
So I walk like my legs big
Is it illegal to have an ego the size of pluto
When I
Know that I'm flyer
Then any guy that you know
Baby what you name is
Tell me who you hang with
Money out the anus
I can make you famous
So many people say that I'm conceited
(Well damn! Come on)
I'm really starting to believe it
Set a lot of goals and I'm starting to achieve it
Tell me what's the reason
Winter spring summer fall
All of ya'll think I'm the one you wanna be with
I be on some "G" shit
I hit it the deepest

Chorus

Flight got delayed I was waiting on the call
Couple hours later performing for a crowd

Just like Vanna White when shawty move a vowel

Get it super wet, now you gone need a towel

It's Wiz Khalifa man (Yeah, yeah!)
It's that 412 shit!
I got that Pittsburgh Sound
Let's get it (Yeah!)

[Verse 1]
Around these parts
I'm known as the youngest in charge
My shit bang out the trunk of your car
It's the city's known rap spitter
Semi blown clap niggas
Skin and bones but really known as that nigga
I'm known to chase the bucks
Grind to get my paper up
In the studio writin' rhymes 'til the paper crunch
I'm not the type that u would call 'em a thug
But I'm a hustler, it's all in my blood
So if it's all for the cheese then I'm in it
My screws kinda loose so I ease to the finish
I hop up in the coupe feel the breeze while I'm in it
Blowin' smoke up out the roof from the trees that I'm spliffin
Youngin' got the game on lock
I'm on top, it's a shame y'all not
You a lame put your brain on pot
Leave you wet like the rain y'all drop
I'm gonna rock and I ain't gonna stop, nigga (Y-yeah!)

[Chorus]
Who's the kid spittin' flames?
Changin' the game
His name, it's Wiz Khalifa man
From the home of the greats
Where they known for the cake
The place, that steel city damn
I got that Pittsburgh sound
And I'mma always hold Pittsburgh down
It's Wiz Khalifa man
You can't tell by now
Pittsburgh I'mma swell my town
That steel city damn

[Verse 2]
Roll rubber you don't know what you dealin' with
Oh so innocent but flows so diligent
My spit game's like a .44 

[?] shit
Know your man warm but the young ball killin' shit
Realist shit and your main wife dig me
Game try and hit me
Kick game like 50 Cent
Niggas wanna play games I quickly
Mob with a squad that will bang y'all wit me
And they want the kid still hurtin'
Hundred niggas with hammers
Yeah that's what I call a steel curtain
Ahead of my time and still workin'
Put in work couple mill worth in
And I'm from Pittsburgh where the green
And the eatin' is good
And the fiends do everything in the hood
Every day is like a war so my soldiers ride fatigues in the hood
And we gettin' all the green like we should (Y-yeah!)

[Chorus]
Who's the kid spittin' flames?
Changin' the game
His name, it's Wiz Khalifa man
From the home of the greats
Where they known for the cake
The place, that steel city damn
I got that Pittsburgh sound
And I'mma always hold Pittsburgh down
It's Wiz Khalifa man
You can't tell by now
Pittsburgh I'mma swell my town
That steel city damn

[Verse 3]
I'm from the home of the great
Where they known for the cake
Where the money stackin' up
Put a chrome to your face
You could step out of line nigga
Thrown 'em into place
That's why all my homies say
It's whatever whenever
I flow so hard and I spit so sick
Got all of these rap niggas on my tip
I 

[?] it ain't none of that homo shit
And that's word to the Philly guys, spliff
It's whatever whenever (Yeah!)

[Chorus]
Who's the kid spittin' flames?

I got that Pittsburgh sound
And I'mma always hold Pittsburgh down
It's Wiz Khalifa man
You can't tell by now
Pittsburgh I'mma swell my town
That steel city damn

[Verse 1]
Take a breath, take it deep
"Calm yourself," he says to me
If you play, you play for keeps
Take the gun and count to three
I’m sweating now, moving slow
No time to think, my turn to go

[Chorus]
And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified, but I’m not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (Trigger, trigger, trigger)

[Verse 2]
Say a prayer to yourself
He says, "Close your eyes
Sometimes it helps"
And then I get a scary thought
That he’s here, means he’s never lost

[Chorus]
And you can see my heart beating
Oh, you can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified, but I’m not leaving
Know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger

[Bridge]
As my life flashes before my eyes
I’m wondering, will I ever see another sunrise?
So many won’t get the chance to say goodbye
But it’s too late to think of the value of my life

[Chorus]
And you can see my heart beating
Ouh-oh, you can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified but I’m not leaving, no
Know that I must pass this test
You can see my heart beating
Oh, you can see it through my chest
I’m terrified but I’m not leaving, no, no
Know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (Trigger, trigger, trigger)
(Chorus)

[Lloyd]

It's getting real tonight, you ain't the only bitch on my mind

You got a deal huh?

[Tyga]

My time ticker on tres, fucking all night, midnight sex
She ride like my old bitch, but she already knew that
She feel me even when I'm gone, pillows between her legs, now she comfortable
Extend your back, … when the shit explode, boom
Picture me tied down for life, I flash too bright, picture won’t look right
I need God advice dealing with these ladies mice
Girls like planes on to the next flight
(Chorus)

[Lloyd]

It's getting real tonight, you ain't the only bitch on my mind
I can make you feel alright, but I ain't gonna fuss a fight
Every girl I see I like, so why wanna waste your time?
You got a deal huh?
I'm like

I'm right, It's gettin' real tonight..

(Verse 2)

[Tyga]

Phone just filled with hoes, conversation goes, back and forth
What you doing? Chilling like Eskimos?
Bet I eat your pussy good like vegetables
Nasty nigga, know you like it though
Freaky ass scorpio she ride me like carnivos
And I'm horny though, sex in the morning though
Hormones got my snowboard going vertical
Vertigo, dizzy on my love boat, heard she got a potty mouth
Watch your ass out with soap
Den we fuck again, she ain't my lover, we just cuddy buddy friends

[Lloyd]
It's getting real tonight, you ain't the only bitch on my mind
I can make you feel alright, but I ain't gonna fuss a fight
Every girl I see I like, so why wanna waste your time?
You got a deal huh?
I'm like
Ya I'm for real though
I'm right, It's gettin' real tonight..

Alright, well alright

Bunk bed flow, always one level above
If I’m in ya starting five you will never need a sub
And I’m neva looking down so I always know wassup
A picture won't do me Justice League in this bitch
I’ma do me trust this
Patience little label nigga you won't rush this
I got the hammer money sweetie you can’t touch this
I got a revolutionary flow in every scenario
Coming through ya stereo
Plus my girlfriend booty round like the merry go
Bitches like where he at, they be like there he go
And this verse deserve a burial
Don’t cry for me this ain’t motha fucking Mario
Yeah, and Polow isn’t at my session
Mr Anticipation Ima keep you niggas guessing like

[Hook]
Ok ok I’m grown, Im grown
Party at my house but I’m home alone
Doing every single thing my momma wouldn’t condone
Counting everything I own in my muthaf-cking ZONE
I’m up too high somebody come get me down down down down
Said I’m up too high somebody get me down down down down

[Drake - Verse 2]
Look, my ex girl said she done dating black guys
She shoulda listened when her white friends advised
Not me I make your battle ships capsize
Get soaked get wet get baptized
I got the full package a nigga complete
I get bread and eat tracks like lunch meat
Sue me and Ima put you on front street
Probably get your records pushed back like front seats
I’m much more then you fathom he would be
And ain't too many niggas that I’d rather be than me
I guarantee the women getting at him would agree
That he should go ahead and put a patent on his g
And I swear these niggas gassed up even though the price is high
I could own half as much clothing and be twice as fly
You know my coupe sit super low
Top slipped off like Janet at the superbowl

[Hook]
Ok ok I’m grown, Im grown
Party at my house but I’m home alone
Doing every single thing my momma wouldn’t condone
Counting everything I own in my muthaf-cking ZONE

Went from Mr. 3-0-5 (Dade County)
To Mr. Worldwide (All around the world), ayy, ayy
Now we're international, so international (Oh, yeah)
International (Woo!), so international

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
You can't catch me, boy (Can't catch me, boy)
I'm overseas at about a hundred G's per show
Don't test me, boy (Don't test me, boy)
'Cause I rap with the best for sure
3-0-5 'til the death of me
Cremate my body, let the ocean have what's left of me
But for now, forget about that
Blow the whistle, baby, you the referee, dale

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Pitbull]
You put it down like New York City, I never sleep (Yeah)
Wild like Los Angeles, my fantasy (Chris Brown, woo!)
Hotter than Miami, I-I-I feel the heat (Oh, yeah)
Oh-oh-oh-oh (Girl, it's), it's international love (International)
Oh-oh-oh-oh (Yeah), it's international love (Woo!)

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
I don't play football, but I've touched down everywhere
(Everywhere? Everywhere)
I don't play baseball, but I've hit a home run everywhere, everywhere (Dale)
I've been to countries and cities I can't pronounce and the places on the globe I ain't know existed (Yeah)
In Romania, she pulled me to the side and told me, "Pit, you can have me and my sister"
In Lebanon, yeah, the women are bomb
And in Greece, you've guessed it, the women are sweet
Been all around the world, but I ain't gon' lie
There's nothing like Miami's heat, dale

You put it down like New York City, I never sleep (Yeah)
Wild like Los Angeles, my fantasy (Uh-huh, woo!)
Hotter than Miami, I-I-I feel the heat (Woo, oh, yeah)
Oh-oh-oh-oh (Girl, it's), it's international love (We're international, let's rise)
Oh-oh-oh-oh (Yeah), it's international love (Woo)

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
Down in DR, they looking for visas
I ain't talking credit cards, if you know what I mean
En Cuba, la cosa está dura
But the women get down, if you know what I mean
In Colombia, the women got everything done
But they some of the most beautiful women I've ever seen
In Brazil, they freaky with big ol' booties
And they thongs, blue, yellow and green
En L.A., tengo la Mexicana
En New York, tengo la boricua
Besito' para toda' la' mujere' en Venezuela, muah
Y en Miami, tengo a cualquiera

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Pitbull]
You put it down like New York City, hey, I never sleep
Wild like Los Angeles (Oh, woah), my fantasy (Woo!)
Hotter than Miami (You're hotter than Miami), I-I-I feel the heat
Oh-oh-oh-oh (All around the world), it's international love (International, woo!)
Oh-oh-oh-oh (Yeah), it's international love (Woo!)

[Bridge: Chris Brown & Pitbull]
There's not a place
That your love don't affect me, baby
So don't ever change
I cross the globe when I'm with you, baby
Hey (Chris Brown), oh, woah (This for the women worldwide, let's ride, woo!)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Pitbull]
You put it down like New York City, I never sleep (Woo, 2-1-2)
Wild like Los Angeles, my fantasy (Ayy, ayy, 3-1-0)
Hotter than Miami (You're hotter than Miami), I-I-I feel the heat (3-0-5)
Oh-oh-oh-oh (Yeah, woo), it's international love (International, let's ride)
Oh-oh-oh-oh (Yeah), it's international love (Woo)
You put it down like (Down) New York City, I never sleep (Woo, 2-1-2)
Wild like Los Angeles (Los Angeles), my fantasy (3-1-0)
Hotter than Miami, I-I-I feel the heat (Oh, yeah, 3-0-5)
Oh-oh-oh-oh (Woo!), it's international love (International)
Oh-oh-oh-oh (Oh, oh), it's international love (Woo!)

[Verse 1]
Check that out, what they playing? That's my song, that's my song
Where my drinks? I've been waiting much too long, much too long
And this girl in my lap passing out, she's a blonde
The last thing on my mind is going home

[Pre-Chorus]
From the window to the wall
This club is jumping 'til tomorrow
Is it daylight, or is it nighttime?
One o'clock, two o'clock, three o'clock, four
We gon' tear the club up, up, up, up, up, up, up

[Chorus]
Day-o, me say day-o

Standing on the chairs, standing on the bar
No matter day or night, I'm shining, bitch, I'm a star

[Pre-Chorus]
From the window to the wall
This club is jumping 'til tomorrow (yeah, 'til tomorrow)
Is it daylight, or is it nighttime?

[Bridge]
I just met this sexy Haitian girl moving like a dancer
Told her and her girlfriends, "Let's meet in my cabana"
Ask me where the party at, baby, I'm the answer
Have another drink with me, shorty, where your manners?
Take another shot, another shot, shot, shot, shot (haha, oh, yeah)

You a bad girl, and your friend's bad too (Ooh)
We got the swag sauce, she dripping swagu

You got the swag sauce, she dripping swagu (Ooh)

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I may be young, but I'm ready
To give you all my love
I told my girls you can get it
Don't slow it down, just let it go

[Pre-Chorus 1: Beyoncé]
So in love, I'll give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
So tonight, I'll do it every way
Speakers knockin' 'til the morning light

[Chorus: Beyoncé, André 3000 & Consequence]
'Cause we like to party, hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
'Cause we like to party, hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
'Cause we like to party!

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Your touch is driving me crazy
I can't explain the way I feel
Top down, with the radio on and the night belongs to us
Just hold me close, don't let me go

[Pre-Chorus 2: Beyoncé]
So in love, I don't care what they say
I don't care if they're talking tomorrow
'Cause tonight's the night, oh-oh-oh-oh
That I give you everything
Music knockin' 'til the morning light
'Cause we like to party!

[Verse 3: André 3000]
Set the scene, 3000 degrees
I ain't worried about them, fuck niggas over there
But they worry about me
I got a homeboy named Butter
And another homeboy there, nigga named Cheese
Fuck with me, baby, I’ll make it milk 'til it drip down your knees
Spit this shit for real-o, Brain Brillo
Kiddo say he looks up to me, this just makes me feel old
Never thought that we could become someone else's hero
Man, we were just in the food court eating our gyros
Yesterday, that's the way, every single morning I try to pray
Grandmom and them, they never forgot
And nothing else really mean nothing to me
I ain't studying the beat
Talking to me? Girl, why you fucking with me?
Move on there, ain't nothing to see
Pshh, always something to saw
I'm the raw, off the rip, 'cause of him
All of them, will remem-ber the min-
Nute they fell in love with rap, black like having your cousin back
Blue like when that rent is due
Cream like when I'm loving you, yeah

[Pre-Chorus 2: Beyoncé]
So in love, I'll give it all away
Just don't tell nobody tomorrow
'Cause tonight's the night, oh-oh-oh-oh
That I give you everything
Music knocking 'til the morning light

[Chorus: Beyoncé, André 3000 & Consequence]
'Cause we like to party, hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
'Cause we like to party, hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
'Cause we like to party!

[Outro: Kanye West]
You a bad girl, and your friend's bad too (Ooh)
We got the swag sauce, she dripping swagu
You a bad girl and your friends bad too (Ooh)
You got the swag sauce, she dripping swagu (Ooh)
There used to be a dream, I guess I made it happen for me
Promise in my eyes, you can read it like a allegory
The game is mine, you're not even in my category
Raped it at a young age, I guess it's like statutory
From California where everybody has a story
You getting lucky if you make it out to get the glory
Feel I be out my mind but I figure it'll happen shortly
All I ask is patience, get a bowl and pack it for me
Left school since then nothing's been the same
For better or whatever really can't complain
I got a little money and I got a little fame
Still smoking everyday to ease my mind and maintain
Addicted to success all I wanna do is gain
Drug with ambition I can feel it in my veins
Crazy how these kids overseas know my name
I was on stage in my Bape Chucks out in Spain
Groupies started coming but that's never on my brain
I'm either thinking money or I'm sleeping on the plane
Haven't been home I got too much to attain
Still niggas hold it down it's loyalty to Wolf Gang
Kept it OG, even when they fronted on
Never been a nigga comfortable with getting stunted on
Thats why they can't figure me, kill them when I'm dropping bombs
Never saw it coming like blind bitches do in porn
Only 20 getting on living like a boss
Smoking like a champion, dressing up to floss
Niggas working ass backwards fucking Kriss Kross
Barking like a big dog but these niggas all talk
And no one the corner has a swagger like mine
To hear that I'm legit don't take a day of sunshine
Wouldn't use a second of my time to worry about a bitch
Too busy in between smoking weed and getting rich
I'm on your channel bitch, I can see you locked in
Real nigga put it on blast like a Glock 10
Wolf Gang reign supreme you niggas boxed in boss shit
All these niggas who said I would not win? Fuck them

[Intro: Pitbull]
Woo-ooh!

[Intro]
He gonna have the nerve to fucking tell me niggas from the south can’t spit?
Bitch I’ll smack your dumb ass
(Fayettenam what up? Carolina what up?)
Stupid ass mother fuckers (New York, what up? Queens)
I'ma quit talking shit and about show y’all
I told y’all niggas that I’m getting my bread and going home
I'ma show you all stupid ass motherfuckers (Coming soon, nigga)
Dumb ass niggas

[Verse 1]
The heir to the throne
South nigga bred to the bone
But haters say he fled from his home (Please)
Now picture that, I was 18 with million dollar dreams (Yeah)
Moved to Jamaica Queens, like Prince Akeem
But ain’t looking for no queen, (nah)
Came to get my c.r.e.a.m. (yup)
City on my back, I just lift my wings, I’m fly
You niggas on my dick, why lie?
Thought them niggas from the south couldn’t spit, voilà
I’m here. humble out of respect, not fear
So please be clear, nigga please beware
I’m a motherfucking monster, B.S. me? (Nah)
No, my hand game like fucking PSP
Now pop the champagne, money is coming soon
My dick do the damn thing, honey it’s cumming soon
She jerking, bend her over, now she hurting
Living reckless got me thinking of death, look how she flirting
Well, fuck that bitch, man a nigga tryna breathe (Yeah)
Some of these niggas be tryna dick her down and leave
Rest in peace, y'all boys living too fast
Caught up in the cash, and got shot up in a flash
Ville niggas don’t play
When it comes to that money, think real niggas won’t spray?
Mid-day when it’s sunny, they kill niggas broad day
On some old new jack shit
This rap shit is like tag nigga you not it, so run

[Chorus]
Ha ha ah
I’m the man, ha ha ha, yeah, hey
I’m the man
I’m the man, (I told y'all niggas)
I’m the man

[Verse 2]
Yeah, uh
They say I act like I’m the man, 'cause motherfucker I am
Niggas study my style, I should be giving exams
Damn boy I'm so flamboyant with the ensemble
Polo jacket, polo tee, what a fine combo
And I’m the man, now understand a nigga bossin’ (Yeah)
Scheming on that drop top CL but it’s costing (Yeah)
Long term plans for the fam, we’ll be golfing
Never catch a nigga double-crossing, unless i’m flossing (Woo)
In the streets niggas peaceful until you force em'
To quarter back them bullet passes, you could Randy Moss ‘em
Goddamn you niggas got handled
Niggas only publishing, my style got sampled
So I switched like a thick bitch with some heels on
I seen a nigga get popped, I feel for ‘em
I know who did it, but you think I’m finna squeal on him?
Shout out to R.J. Hill I would kill for him
That’s word, nigga observe my genius
E&J sipping got a nigga straight leaning
My DNA dripping while your girl stay drinking (Haha)
I told y’all I’m the man, what the fuck y'all niggas thinking?

[Chorus]
Ha ha ah
I’m the man, ha ha ha, yeah, hey
I’m the man
I’m the man, (I told y'all niggas)
I’m the man

[Outro]
Yea
First and foremost, Fayettenam what’s good?
Carolina, what up? Bull city, Raleigh, Charlotte, Salem
Greensboro, Wilmington, nigga
Everywhere dog, I’m reppin' from long distance, man
I told y’all boy, I’m bout to get this money and come home right quick
Y’all niggas still see me tho, you think I’m still there; you ain’t even know I’m gone
Back so much, nigga
I hear you all little niggas talking, nigga
Prince of the city, nigga
Prince of the south, nigga, holla at me
Ya know? Heir to the throne, bitch

[Chorus]
I been this way before
Dreamed of havin' so much more

[Intro]
I do It
For the city, man

[Verse 1]
Feeling like I got the cheat code to life
Jewelry looking like it got free-throwed in ice
Debating with the Reaper not to repo my life
Cause in my 23 years I've lived a couple lives
Like why? Cause I stunt? Bag the tree like it's fall?
The girls that was out of my league trying to play with my balls
I pay bills, I work hard, and when my mama cried a river
They never gave us a bridge, they gave us a bridge card
Nigga riding low, puffing on loud
I came way too far to fuck it up now
Text from my mom said "Me and your grandma proud"
I'm way too deep in the game to go sit back in the crowd
Teacher told me to get a job, save up for 401(K)
Man, I'd rather be young as shit counting 401k
I'd rather die with a smile instead
I'm just multiplying my money and dividing the legs

[Chorus]
I been this way before
Dreamed of havin' so much more

[Verse 2]
But I'm never dividing the bread
Bitch, I bet I get the debit if I don't get the cred I deserve
Throwing West side up like Pac up
Where they pop your block up, b-blocka big poppa flock off
You holy lil' whoaty holy kenobi chewbacca
I'm Balenciaga, Chanel, Hermes but I bet you that you won't find it
Rockin' Louis and MCM, I guess I'm clothes-minded
Obama suite, you one below up in the Joe Biden
I'm in your city just chilling where all your hoes hiding?
20k for the fit because it's 24 carats
I can't lie, the price'll probably go up when I wear it
I'm just D-town repping
Making all these niggas who second-guessed regret it
Regret it like half the hoes I smashed in the sheets
At least I realize now how much I love Ashley Marie
And when it's all said and done, I'll probably get on my knee
Cause she put up with too many games not to have her a ring
Man, she almost cried when she seen me on TV on BET
Just making it seem easy! Standing next to Common Sense and Yeezy

[Chorus]
I been this way before (And the whole world see me)
Dreamed of havin' so much more (Bitch I know you see me)

[Verse 3]
Man, I wake up to a wet dream
Every day's a Friday and every night's a sex scene
Every week is Fashion Week and every day I'm pressed clean
Detroit's angel, I even got red wings
Headed to the ball, me and three prom queens
It's prom night, and guess who's the prom king?
They having a kissing fight and I'm Don King
Everybody know I'm coming soon like Lebron's ring
Tell me that wasn't the verse of the year
Man, that shit deserves a hearse and a tear
Swear to God I'm overlaid, all my girls get overfucked
All my deals be overpaid and all my joints be overstuffed
Finally Famous bitch, there ain't a fucking thing that's over us
So take that check out and owe it up! Man, I turn impossible possible
And what these niggas could barely see into optimal
The same teacher who told me rap is what not to do
Said I'm throwing my life away, if I drop out of school
Want me to come speak to the kids, the point I gotta prove
Is that I did everything they told me not to do
After I went down the road they told me not to cruise
They ain't know that was my road to success
Now my picture on the wall hanging to help the kids follow through
My dream girl is every night, my dream car is optional
My old school look like a T-Rex: I should feed her fossil fuels
Man, I turn my enemies to molecules, lil' hoes
Without any preparation, I exceed these expectations
Man they wanna see me dead, but I gave 'em dedication
And I'm yelling fuck 'em all with a hundred exclamations
Cause I'ma be the man til my fucking expiration

[Chorus]
I been this way before
Dreamed of havin' so much more

[Outro]
BIG, I do it, this goes out to my muthafucking city of Detroit
Westside to be exact, right over there on Northlawn

[Chorus]
I been this way before
Dreamed of havin' so much more

[Intro]
Where we at? Right by Libra? Churches? Okay!

[Verse]
I used to walk 'round that corner right on Flintwood
Pack your bag shorty with a 100 pounds of good
I was trapping like a fool, me and FF Fool
Kept that fucking tool, didn't go to school
I was trapping like a bitch, I sold a lot of bricks
I hit a lot of licks, I really don't give a shit
'Bout a pussy ass nigga, a pussy ass ho
It's Gucci Mane La Flair, my chain look like rainbow
Shorty looking at me, I think that nigga muggin'
I think he don't like me and the way my clique thuggin'
We smoking out in public, you know them bitches love it
Me and Shawty Lo poppin' thirty bottles of bubbly
Yeah
I'm a real trap nigga
Bust it out the wrapper, sell it to a trapper
Me and young Juice, sippin' 80 proof
Box Chevy 98, money out the roof
I was going to the atrium, like a gymnasium
Beat like a fool, that was 1998, I was still getting cake
Now a nigga real straight, got 3.4 Mil, bitch nigga, in ya' face
Pussy
You done heard about that
That the boy got them M's
That that boy got stacks
Me and Zay, we shitting in ya' face
But the flawless in that Bart cost 138
Pussy
And I got it from my deal, so what does that tell ya'
Nigga
Ya feel me Shawty?
Chyea

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm young Khalifa
I'm young-I'm young Khalifa (x7)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
All about my money if you not, I'll see you later
I take out the first two letters and say "Ha-ha" to you haters
I got rooms with elevators
Yeah, they say I'm futuristic
Got a iPhone for business but the Sidekick's for the bitches
Haha

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Stupid swaggered up, niggas mad at us
All my niggas rep that gang and my bitch she bad as fuck
Hair down her back, Religion always true
My president is black, my head coach too
Oooh

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Tatted like a Mexican, fresher than a freshman
Pocket full of Benjamin's, how much ain't a question
Wouldn't believe how many older women that be crushing
Never quick to make a scene to me that's really nothing

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Claim your flow insane but niggas not so sick
Let 'em heat up 'fore I eat 'em
Hope the pot don't stick
And my nikes don't fit, but my jeans do
Apoligize for shitting on you niggas I ain't mean to
I see life in plain view I'm looking out the window
Liquor, Swisher, Tips and that bitch to fluff my pillow
California trips got me on some different swag
If you didn't know who I was, I bet you know it now
Yeah

[Hook]

Don't treat me to the things of the world

Your love is what I prefer, what I deserve
Here’s a man that makes me, then takes me
And delivers me to a destiny, to infinity and beyond
Pull me into your arms
Say I’m the one you want
If you don’t, you’ll be alone
And like a ghost, I’ll be gone

You can call 'em priority of 'da next day
They call the next day like "Maine I'm still rollin'"

[Intro: Damian Marley]
Now greetings to da world (All of you)
Voice of da one called Bruno Mars, 'long side gong to da zilla
(Ya know I mean? I roll)

[Verse 1: Bruno Mars]
Standing at this liquor store
Whiskey coming through my pores
Feeling like I run this whole block
Lotto tickets, cheap beer
That's why you can catch me here
Tryna scratch my way up to the top

[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
'Cause my job's got me going nowhere
So I ain't got a thing to lose
Take me to a place where I don't care
This is me and my liquor store blues

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
I'll take one shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
One shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow

[Verse 2: Bruno Mars]
Me and my guitar, tonight
Singing to the city lights
Tryna leave with more than what I got
'Cause sixty-eight cent just ain't gon' pay the rent
So I'll be out here 'til they call the cops

[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
'Cause my job's got me going nowhere
So I ain't got a thing to lose
Take me to a place where I don't care
This is me and my liquor store blues

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
I'll take one shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today
I'll be okay tomorrow
One shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow
Get messed up today

Pineapple kush between my jaws
Has got me feeling like I'm on top
Feeling like I woulda stand up to de cops
And stand up to de bigga heads
Becaw de whole ah de mah saps
All de talk dem a talk
And dem fly make nah drop
Nuff ghetto youth cannot escape de trap

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Give me this one shot for my pain
One drag for my sorrow

Get messed up today

[Intro]
Exclusive, Nicki Minaj, let's go
As I sit back, relax, crack jokes for a minute
I think about the up-and-comers that could prolly get it

[Verse 1]
I might go to jail for fuckin' with Hell Rell
If he get ill and pull on my ponytails
I heard Maino life was like a movie (C'mon)
Set up the cameras, fuck him in the jacuzzi (My life is a movie)
Freekey Zekey, that should be easy, he just came home (Home)
I know he wanna bone (I know he wanna bone)
"But what about J.R. Writer?" I'ma skill him
And when I r-r-ride him, I'ma grill him (Kyuh)
That nigga Pap, he might could fuck me (Fuck me)
But I ain't tryna be drip-drippin' no Gino Green (No Gino Green)
Tell Stack to bring the black card up
But if I fuck him, would he, would he yell, "Squad up?"
Tell Rich Boy to send me a pink toy (Kyuh)
Throw some Ds on it (Uh-huh) and I might breathe on it (Okay)
And when I'm Philly, I gotta fuck Gillie (Ah-ha)
Snatch his big MAC and slap a bitch silly

[Chorus]
Dreams of fuckin' a rap-rap dude
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin'
Dreams of fuckin' a rap-rap dude
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin'
Dreams of fuckin' a rap-rap dude
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin'
Dreams of fuckin' a rap-rap dude
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin'

[Verse 2]
Put it in halfway, (Who?) Red Café
Put the pussy on his freckles (Ha-ha, that tickles)
Uncle Murda could bring the handcuffs, why's that?
I gotta what? Yo, gotta get a ruffneck (Oh, I get it)
As for Gravy, he might could beat (He might could beat)
You know them fat niggas love to eat (Love to eat)
And when I wanna Nicki Minaj, who could it be? (Yeah)
It's them Young Gunnaz, Chris and Lil' Neef
"Well, Nicki, what about Fendi? He made you pop" (I don't know)
Tell him to kick rocks (Kyuh) or give me some top (C'mon)
I'm on my way to Jers, break Ransom off
Quench his thirst when my pants come off
Murda Mook and Millz gon' have to battle (Uh-huh)
Scoop whoever win and tell 'em to skee-daddle (Kyuh)
Run up on Mims, he could give me back shots (Come here)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot, nigga

[Chorus]
Dreams of fuckin' a rap-rap dude
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin'
Dreams of fuckin' a rap-rap dude
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin'
Dreams of fuckin' a rap-rap dude
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin'
Dreams of fuckin' a rap-rap dude
I'm just playin', but I'm sayin'

[Verse 1]
Darlin' I, I can't explain
Where did we lose our way
Girl it's drivin' me insane
And I know I just need one more chance
To prove my love to you
And if you come back to me
I'll guarantee
That I'll never let you go

[Chorus]
Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they use to be?
Oh God give me a reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

[Verse 2]
So many nights I dream of you
Holding my pillow tight
And I know I don't need to be alone
When I open up my eyes
To face reality
Every moment without you
It seems like eternity
I'm begging you, begging you come back to me

[Chorus]
Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they use to be?
Oh God give me a reason
I'm down on bended knee
I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

[Spoken]
Baby, I'm sorry
Please forgive me for all the wrong I've done
Please come back home, girl
I know you put all your trust in me
I'm sorry I let you down
Please forgive me

[Bridge]
I'm Gonna swallow my pride
Say I'm sorry
Stop pointing fingers the blame is on me
I want a new life
And I want it with you
If you feel the same
Don't ever let it go
You gotta believe in the spirit of love
It'll heal all things
It won't hurt anymore
No I don't believe our love's terminal
I'm down on my knees begging you please
Come home

[Chorus]
Can we go back to the days our love was strong?
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong?
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be?
Oh God give me a reason
I'm down on bended...
Down on bended knee
I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee
Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they use to be
Oh God give me a reason
I'm down on
Down on bended knee
I'll never walk again until you come back to me
I'm down on bended knee

[Outro]
Wanna build a new life
Just you and me
Gonna make you my wife
Raise a family

[Intro: Ericka Lee]
Hello?
Yeah, I just walked in
Yeah, I'm good, you still working?
Tonight, right now?
Did I go out? Yeah, I went out, I went
I went to a couple of clubs
I never went to bed, shit
Wine or water?
Did you say something about a cold drink? I don't know
I'm delirious

[Verse 1: Drake]
Cups of the rosé
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy
But I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call her anyway and say

[Chorus: Drake]
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you pick up, I know he's not around, oh, oh

[Post-Chorus: Drake & Ericka Lee]
Are you drunk right now?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, cups of the XO
All my people been here
I see all of her friends here
Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flight's in the morning
What you doin' that's so important?
I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call you anyway and say

[Chorus: Drake]
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you pick up, I know he's not around

[Post-Chorus: Drake & Ericka Lee]
Are you drunk right now?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

[Verse 3: Drake]
I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sittin' talkin' 'bout bitches that we almost had
I don't think I'm conscious of makin' monsters
Outta the women I sponsor 'til it all goes bad
But, shit, it's all good
We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just callin' 'cause they were just leavin'
Talk to me, please, don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's livin' off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week, I'll explain
Havin' a hard time adjustin' to fame
Sprite in there mixed up
I've been talkin' crazy, girl, I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on
Fuck, I'm sorry

[Post-Chorus: Drake & Ericka Lee]
Are you drunk right now?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

[Interlude: Drake]
You not gon' come?
I guess I'm 'bout to just kick it here then

[Outro: Drake]
Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said, "You niggas crazy," I hope no one heard that
Yeah, I hope no one heard that
'Cause if they did, we gon' be in some trouble, yeah
If they did, we gon' be in some trouble, trouble, oh

[Verse 1 : Trey Songz]
We was so official
See the tears to my tissue?
On my shoulder was the tissue for her tears
I told my fears
She told me her fears
She said she'd do whatever so we'd make it through the years
So whys the moment here when we not together?
Thought we suppose to be forever
Sick to my stomach wanna vomit and Im bummin
I ain't got a hair cut in bout month and I be frontin
When you calling in the morning like you want it but you don't you just be frontin Why you frontin?
I'm abusing my substance doing a lot of puffing doing a lot of cussing'
Talking to myself like 'Trigga what happened?' (ha ha)
Yelling one minute next minute Im laughing
Next minute Im crying
Next minute Im dying
Pass me the Aspirin
Start to buck it all back then
Look at the sky like lord what you asking?
Why'd you take her away from me
Why'd she have to go
Father this is sudden and I only wanna know
Was supposed to plant my seed in her
We was supposed to grow
Is it what she said or another nigga though?
Ain't nobody can't nobody else be with my baby
See her with another man I'll probably go crazy
I am crazy
I'd kill him If I seen him
How I'm feeling I ain't playing
I am playing
Getting my Kanye in
Baby this is Trey and everyday they in a weigh-in
They be saying I dont be slaying these beats so maliciously
Tell me why you dissing me
I try to leave the mic alone she called an said she misses me I came back
Now ain't that sweet of me for me to be
Givin her what she need
All day its VA to The Bay to NY to LA
I been fly
I been passed guys in the rearview
Aye lookie hear you
I don't care what my pears do
Its alot of you's like seal food
So many fish in the sea
Only one me
Only 1 Songz
Ain't no one song I won't jump on and get my thump on
Beat the track up like it jumped on
My momma and thats on my Momma
And ain't no rhymer
Ain't no singer
Ain't no human
Ain't no creature that can fill my sneakers
I sound so good through the tweeters I smell so hood from the reefer
Yet Im tryna change my imagery but Im still real I ain't never been gimmicky
Said Im great now but image what Im finna be
I'm filled with flatery everytime they mimic me
Aye! im at the top of my game
An ain't nobody poppin my chain I dont even wear one but the goons gone bang
If you reach for any motherfuckin thing its Tremaine

[Outro]
Yeah, Kanye gon' sing
So Im gon' rap a little bit
I don't give a fuck about how you feel about it either
Bet that
You know, I was 23 a couple days ago
MJ'ing it
I guess now Im gonna get my Kobe on
Too forward
Still Im in the zone don't get that confused
I see you seeing me
I was in Petersburg for a couple days gave away a couple turkeys
Went to DC shut that down Friday night
Saturday went to Baltimore and shut that down
Sunday Im in the A, Red Velvet room
Now Im in the crib getting at it
What it do?

[Kanye Original Version After]
You don't like crazy music
You don't like rockin' bands
You just wanna go to a movie show
And sit there holding hands
You're so square
Baby I don't care

I don't why my heart flips
I only know it does
I wonder why I love you baby
I guess it's just because
You're so square
Baby I don't care

You don't know any dance steps that I do
I only know I love you like I do, I do, I do

I don't why my heart flips
I only know it does
I wonder why I love you baby
I guess it's just because
You're so square
Baby I don't care

[Chorus: Cymphonique]
I remember standing in the mirror
Searching for a winner but I didn’t see it in her
Now I’ve gone from a zero to a super-hero-oh-oh
Woah, woah
Chasing dreams got me all over the world
Now I’m sitting on top of the world
We winning, we winning
Cause we sitting on top of the world

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
This is for the little girls that say Nicki you pretty
When you come to the city you don't act high siddity
You be up on the block, posted up in the drop
And everybody get up in, whether you like it or not
But how them girls blow up but don’t come to the hood?
How they turn they nose up like they don’t come from the hood?
Most of them be in sight til it’s time to pitch in
That's why everything they write be a contradiction
I tell em I do it for the love, I do it for the hugs
I do it for the buzz, I do it for the thugs
I do it for the rich, I do it for the poor
I do it for the kid that can’t do no more

[Chorus: Cymphonique]
I remember standing in the mirror
Searching for a winner, but I didn’t see it in her
Now I’ve gone from a zero to a super-hero-oh-oh
Woah, woah
Chasing dreams got me all over the world
Now I’m sitting on top of the world
We winning, we winning
Cause we sitting on top of the world

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
This is for my little homies that be asking for kisses
When I’m granting they wishes they be passing they digits
They be up on the block getting screwed by the cops
Cutting school, gettin knocked whether they like it or not
They’ll break in your door
Might break in your jaw
They’ll bring back a lot
If you bring them an O
But what you really ain’t know
They airborne for stardom
With the ball in the Garden, stand tall, no dodgin’
No matter the squadron, lieutenant or sergeant
Air Force, the Army, Air Force and Army
Fatigues is on him, no heats is on him
Cause grandmama prayed, that he’d leave the corner

[Chorus: Cymphonique]
I remember standing in the mirror
Searching for a winner, but I didn’t see it in her
Now I’ve gone from a zero to a super-hero-oh-oh
Woah, woah
Chasing dreams, got me all over the world
Now I’m sitting on top of the world
We winning, we winning
Cause we sitting on top of the world

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
I remember when I lost everything in a fire
Now I got fire 23′s on my tire
Shout outs to my brothers, Jelani and Macaiah
Thanks to the Messiah, my money getting higher
One time for my niggas, that be huggin’ the block
Two Times for my niggas, that be ducking the cops
Three Times for my girls that pushing they own rides
Stushing they own ride, bitches they don't lie
Sometimes you get mad, wanna blaze the gun
Look, I see you without a man ma, you raised ya son
Well look, when you blow up everybody go shudder
This goes out to everybody on the come up

[Chorus: Cymphonique]
I remember standing in the mirror
Searching for a winner, but I didn’t see it in her
Now I’ve gone from a zero to a super-hero-oh-oh
Woah, woah
Chasing dreams, got me all over the world
Now I’m sitting on top of the world
We winning, we winning
Cause we sitting on top of the world

Oh Pitbull, now we're stuck with this fucking dorky white kid
Holy shit you ruined the whole year, congratulations, oh, CONGRATULATIONS!

Ever since you called, you called
Got the water runnin', just like you said
Now my body's burnin' and I start to sweat
I could never do what we do all alone
Alone

[Hook]
Girl its half an hour past ten
Got me waitin' in my bed
You’ve been busy in my head
Since noon
I got to feel you, freak you
Since noon
I got to feel you, freak you

[Refrain]
Come to my appoint
Come to, come to my appointment
Come to my appoint
Come to, come to my appointment
Come to my appoint
Come to, come to my appointment
Come to my appoint
Come to, come to my appointment

[Verse 2]
Now I feel the urge, I hope you feel it too
Now imagine girl what I'mma do to you
Girl the image of your body got me sprung, me sprung
Never felt like this about another one
You are killing me girl cause is half past one
My body trembles every time my clock agrees

[Hook]
Girl it's half an hour past ten
Got me waitin' in my bed
You’ve been busy in my head
Since noon

Since noon

[Outro]
I wanna fuck you, I wanna fuck you, I wanna fuck you

[Intro - Lil Wayne]
Yeah, is the tune on? oh, it's on
Basically
I got Streets in the booth with me
Dedication trois

[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne]
Now let me talk my shit
Fresh up out the water like I caught fly fish
Weezy F. bitch, I can say what I please
Swagger so cold it stay when I leave
I see you little doggs just shaking out fleas
I kill dogs like I'm making Chinese, food
Rude only when I gotta be
Sometimes I gotta tell myself not to bother me
"Tell Lil Wayne not to bother Weez!"
Shawty won't be on my team, she could cheerlead
Shit, like "Go, Wayne, go!"
Ice on a white tee, I make a snow angel
Y'all niggas squares, but ain't got no angle
My shit's so tight you can get strangled
It's Young Money, ain't no such thing as plain clothes
Polo jammers, Louis slippers
Call them "private plane clothes"
I'm taking off, going to another land
Call her misses, never going to another man
Shabba Ranks Weezy, muthafucker, I'm a lover man
Yeah talk that shit Tune
I gotta wipe my diamond grill with a tissue
I'm talking too much shit
I eat pussy and you suck dick

[Kidd Kidd]
They call me "Lil Nut" but my nuts aren't
The same. No homo, that's how I came in the
The game, I married Mary Jane, I seen the
Spidermane, the shit that made Pinky blow
Out the Brain brain. Told Lois Lane
I can't be a Super Mane, my whole
Suit black like bat mane and I keep that iron, mane
Any woman yellow flag me, throw me out
The game, I'm back at the halftime
Like it's just an ankle sprain
Ain't no one could do it better
More hits than Eddie Guerrerra
The flow like ? at the competitors
It's mass hysteria. Historic in
Your area, 51 alien, what planet is he from
Huh? Ain't no fun when the rabbit got the shotgun
Picture Bugz with the shotgun up to Elmer Fudd
All my thugs get dirty like we running
In the mud, we 7:30 livewires
Plug off the chain, utterly untame
Put the gun to your frame, bitch a bloodstain
Hard to come out, like a love-stain
I came from nothing, fucking calling hoes
And flying planes; who the fuck could complain?

[Gudda Gudda]
So you mad cause I'm styling on you?
Lights off, mask on, creepy siding on you
Get violent on you, you a sissy like Sisqó
Gudda: I'm the East gang schizo
It's no coincidence, man, I bet your bitch know
How I knock her down with the Kosher dill pickle
How I yell a nigga but my heart dark like nut skin
Bitches aiming for the pockets? You get nothing
Let me get back in it, bitch
I just go ahead first, you be on that timid shit
Get head first, then I be on my Jimmy shit
Shitting on bitches with that Chris Brown
"Don't give me shit!" Niggas in the streets say
"Kill them all!" Bitch, you know we got guns
Like the Pentagon. I'm just eating nigga
I'm getting my dinner on
And your bitch licking: getting her lizard on

[T-Streets]
Talk reckless, I don't give a muthafuck
I make you do what you is, bitch nigga, duck
Come for you and your kids like nigga what
Niggas with elephantitis ain't got bigger nuts
Young Money nigga: big dicks, big trucks
I'mma smash a nigga if he try to diss us
Go to court: the case get dissmussed
Cause if we did time, your main bitch would miss us

[Mack Maine]
It's Mack Maine: ain't shit to discuss
I get up in a bitch throat like hiccups
I Chris Kringle bullets with niggas like Christmas
Then turn to their female dog like "bitch, what?"
My niggas squeeze triggers like they got arthiritis
My dick big: that's why I walk like I got tendonitis
I spit nasty on the mic like I got gingivitis
The doc said I got a case of "real" nigganitis
He ain't got a vaccine or cure strong enough to fight it
See, I'm a warrior. They compare me to Leonidus
I got a set fee: I ain't about discussing prices
Cause I ain't tryna go broke like Hammer or Mike Tyson
Wish you could see my face now
Feel like I'm poltergeisting
See me in streets, be Street Fighting like
Blanka or Bison. Slicing, dicing
Like w butcher knifeing. Wifing
Bitches? Never, that shit is trifling
Young Money the fucking nicest
Put words together like a fucking hypen
Nigga don't make us start fucking rifling
Nigga we got a lot of rappers striking
Standing by the harvest for fruit
Waiting for the fruit to ripen
We run up on niggas and jack the for their stipend
Catch me in Minnesota like I'm a Viking
I'm with every video vixen you liking
I'm the reason your bitch dyking
How I get like this?
I'll pump a nigga breaks, something like Midas
I try to be modest, nigga I'm honest
And this is what I did for my birthday, bitch
I ain't get no pussy though

[Intro: Childish Gambino]
Yeah!

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
We can go to Saturn, it doesn’t really matter
We can get there, we can do it if we try
You know that I love you, put no one else above you
We can get there, we can do it if we try

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
Knock, knock, it’s me
I’ma take ya fine ass out to Applebee’s
Get anything you want, this shit is free
My friend work here
Whatcha mean, I ain’t romantic?
I bought you flowers, so what they plastic?
We could fuck for hours, so what, I’m nasty?
I ain’t got the roommate, that was my old place
I’ma take you to the crib and show you the ‘O’ face
You make me feel like I’m back in the 5th grade
Had a crush on Keana and she rocked the one braid
And I thought that sex was when you touched a girl’s butt
You could get a girl pregnant, so look, but don’t touch
I like you so much, I know it sound crazy
But I’d have a sex change just so I could have your baby
The roles are reversed, so you got a huge dick, and I got a Prada purse
A nigga so sick, that my car’s a doctor
Take a gamble on a nigga that your name was Proctor
Kick it in Chinese like you’re Shaolin soccer
Got nothin’ but dinero, so you meetin’ the Fockers
Look at my clock-ers, it’s time to roll out
Get sneaks, sneaks, and sneaks, and they sold out
That’s what I’m all about and if you got the time
It’s hard to make change when you want one dime

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
We can go to Saturn, it doesn’t really matter
We can get there, we can do it if we try
You know that I love you, put no one else above you
We can get there, we can do it if we try

[Verse 2: Eugene Cordero]
Welcome back everyone to "Pinoys in Space"
Got a new constellation for you to trace
Use the far East star for your startin’ place
You see it? My big dipper's slappin’ you in the face
Step out of the shed, let the sun be felt
On your head as you undo Orion’s belt
Oh nuts! I just crashed landed on the planet of the gay cliché
Talkin’ Milky Way, bouquets, Broadway, bubblay and Michael Bublé
Sorry if I caught you off-guard with my five-second delay
But the jet-lag’s making me loopy and my sales are soupy
Soupy Sales! I eat chocolate!

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
We can go to Saturn, it doesn’t really matter
We can get there, we can do it if we try
You know that I love you, put no one else above you
We can get there, we can do it if we try
We can go to Saturn, it doesn’t really matter
We can get there, we can do it if we try
You know that I love you, put no one else above you
We can get there, we can do it if we try

[Outro: Childish Gambino]
I love you baby (I love you baby)
I love you baby (I love you baby)
I love you baby (I love you baby)
I love you baby
I love you baby (I love you baby)
I love you baby (I love you baby)
I love you baby (I love you baby)
I love you baby
I love you baby (I love you baby)
I love you baby (I love you baby)
I love you baby (I love you baby)
I love you baby
I love you baby
I love you baby

[Intro: Rihanna]
Here's a little story I've gotta tell
'Bout this boy I know so well
Back in the day was cool and all
Fell in love, I fell in love
Thought he was the one for me
Other boys I could not see
And look what happened to our love
I'm like how could it be?

[Verse 1: Rihanna & will.i.am]
It shoulda been me and you
It coulda been you and me
But boy, you broke my heart and now I'm standing there
It shoulda been me and you
It coulda been you and me
Now all I got are these photographs

[Chorus: Rihanna & will.i.am]
All I've got, all I've got
All I've got are these photographs
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Now baby, it's killing me
I'm saying it's killing me
The fact that you ain't around
Baby, I'm falling down
I need me a remedy
Been looking for remedies
I need you to be around
Baby, I'm hurting now
I know you're a better man
When I was your girl
This land is a better land
When you're in my world
Today will be better, babe
If it were like yesterday
So happy and lovely
Hey, hey, hey

[Chorus: Rihanna & will.i.am]
All I've got, all I've got
All I've got are these photographs
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you

[Refrain: Rihanna]
All I've got are these photographs
I remember when I used to make you laugh
I don't wanna be stuck in the past
But you're all that I have, that I had
And I don't wanna lose what we built this far
This is me and you, you're my superstar
I'd give anything, baby, here's my heart
My heart, my heart

[Verse 3: will.i.am]
My heart don't stop, my heart be beating over
My loving never stop, even though that it's over
Girl, I've been reminiscing when I play that Casanova
Way back when we was kissing on your grandmama's sofa
Girl, I got us lovey-dovey on my photo album
I got them pictures back when I was rocking Calvin Klein
You had your Guess jeans on, looking sexy, oh no
Girl, why could it not be the one?

[Bridge: Rihanna & will.i.am]
Why? Why? Why?
Why couldn't I be the one?
(Why? Why? Why?)
Why couldn't you be the one?
(Why? Why? Why?)
Why couldn't you be the one?
(Why? Why? Why?)

[Chorus: Rihanna & will.i.am]
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you, you, you
Is nothing without you, you, you
Is nothing without you

[Outro: Rihanna with will.i.am]
All I've got, is nothing without
All I've got, is nothing without
All I've got, all I've got are these photographs

[Verse 1]
Now as time moves on and my clout gets bigger
How manny bitches wanna fuck this nigga
Iphone full of missed calls from this sick broad
Only fucked once, she complaining how she miss dog
Bitch chill there ain't nobody tripping over here
Appeared to have feelings watch me make them feelings disappear
Yeah, the magicians here, just kicking it
I'm sick with this pimping shit playing hoes ridiculous
I ain't got love for them only 'bout the grind
It's hunger on my heart and desire on my line
These other smoke behind, must beating through the fast lane
She pipe blowing no rice throwing keep your last name
I let you hit the weed, what else could you really need
You high and delirious telling me, you can't breathe
When you're without me, you don't know how you should be
That's the addiction, this bitch is under my cheese

[Hook]
Thats the addiction, this bitch is under my cheese
And bitches under my sleeve, yup, tryna smoke my weed up
Reefer, that's what I'm talking 'bout
Sativa, Indica, you need to listen to me
Little girl, you acting so basic (Bitch)
I'm tired of your payless ass
You need to cop some Asics, you basic (Bitch)
You need a mothafuckin' facelift, I like 'em classic, dinosaur Jurassic

[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
Same old, same old, bitch you's a lame old
You're not the pot of gold to be at the end of a rainbow
It's Ludacris abusiveness, I ain't got time
I'm busy on my music shit, is Nike tryna do this shit?
Hodgy back to prove this shit and watch the bank approve the snitch
With big checks in 'em, recognize a pro, he bring the vets with 'em
Respect the vibe of hoes countering long neck syndrome
Average is basic, day five well day six
Different day, same shit, my high speaks my language
Articular terminology, follow me or swallow me
Shallow me, blow these basics off
Like kush Cali weed, basic meaning basic salary
Face lift over exceeding calories, instead of weight watchers
She getting donuts from Valerie's, colors flux from mood rings
Now she ain't happy, the hood rat come out
And the weave gets nappy, Hodgy leaving this ratch

[Hook]
Thats the addiction, this bitch is under my cheese
And bitches under my sleeve, yup, tryna smoke my weed up
Reefer, that's what I'm talking 'bout
Sativa, Indica, you need to listen to me
Little girl, you acting so basic (Bitch)
I'm tired of your payless ass
You need to cop some Asics, you basic (Bitch)
You need a mothafuckin' facelift, I like 'em classic, dinosaur Jurassic

[Hook: Flo Rida]
Din daa daa, din daa daa, din daa daa, oh whoa
Din daa daa, din daa daa, din daa daa, oh whoa
Baby girl I want you, look, keep putting on a show

Break that booty down

Break that booty down

Break that booty down

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Din daa daa, oh whoa
Shorty got it jumping around
And I'm thrown
And we got a couple of rounds
Of Nuvo
Everybody looking around like uh-oh
Okay, what you say, let's play
Shake it with a little bit of Beyoncé
Turn around and give it to me shorty get paid
Do it for them girls they be jealous anyway
On stage, I wanna be amazed
Pop that, drop that its your birthday
Top that got stacks, work for this paych
Stop that, lock that, work it in place
You the best, shorty don't be scurred
Let loose get a Louis like hers
You da truth get money its yours
Back it up like that yes sir

[Pre-hook: Flo Rida]
Uh-oh baby
Want some more baby
I love the way you do it
Cuz you do it so crazy
I'm counting down
So turn around
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and I make that booty go

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Mr. Worldwide!
Flo Rida!
This right here is called global warming
Hahaha, dale
Work hard for the money
So the money work hard for me
I see the future
That ya'll too blind to see
Like glue mami
That tonight on top of me
Don't believe me watch and see
Is he one of the best?
I already told you
(Indistinguishable)
Drink all night
Nothing less
Wake up hungover
Onto the next
My English can
But my women
You meet em greet em and need em
I meet em greet em and eat em
Feast - I'm an animal, monster
Beast - you on her
That means you got Mary
Not me, I'm just here to unleash

[Pre-hook]

[Hook]

I don't have the words to say
When you shake it my way
You got me still stuttering
Can I make you stay?
I don't have the words to say
When you shake it my way
You got me still stuttering

Break that booty down

[Pre-hook]

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in
On a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family
All dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

[Pre-Chorus]
This is surely not
What you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now"

[Verse 2]
Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited
By your lovely bride-to-be

[Pre-Chorus]
She floats down the aisle
Like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me (Don't you?)

[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now"
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
Your time is running out
And they said, "Speak now"

[Interlude]
Ooh, la-da-da-da, oh
Ooh, ooh
(Say a single vow)

[Bridge]
I hear the preacher say
"Speak now or forever hold your peace"
There's the silence, there's my last chance
I stand up with shaking hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only looking at you

[Verse 3]
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in
On a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
(Hehe!)

[Chorus 2]
So don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now"
And you say, "Let's run away now
I'll meet you when I'm out
Of my tux, at the back door
Baby, I didn't say my vows
So glad you were around
When they said, 'Speak now'"
I do not talk, I am just a rapper

It's the kid with the voice
Hipster kids are like "fuckin' NOICE!!"
"How the fuck did he do this shit?!"
"This song's been out for like fifteen minutes"
Yeah I did it
Mr. Incredible, when everybody's special, no one is
So I guess I'm So Much Better
That's my song like girls with tight sweaters, get it?
That one's for the fans, purell on my hands
This nigga stay dirty like two trash cans
I'm Dope in white hoods not Ku Klux Klan
I'm Dope in black hoods not the Dope Man, That cocaine
You don't even know me like Steve Urkel
That was a prototype, now I'm flexin', like the radio
And I used to be Slim like Shady, though
Now I'm so fat, that's a true fact
Got balls like I grew a new nut sack
Girls go nuts when I drive by
Gotta hide my dick, Lady GaGa
It's a Bug's Life for these other guys
I'm a giant, I don't compromise
Been down with these dudes like a comforter
Only direction to go, then, is Up for me
I do not talk, I'm a rapper
Beat rapist, I attack it
And this rap game? It's a racket
And these fake dudes still tryna crack it
Do Pixar, do your own thing
Then get signed by Disney
It's hard work, but it's easy
In other words, just be me
Love life so bad I would die for it
And I wouldn't trade an eye for an eye for it
Hip Hop's little brother, on top but undercover
With a girl and we see each other
But we don't date, there's a difference
Cause I don't get gifts like Christmas
Bambi is the man of the hour
The decade
The century
The millenium

[Intro: T.I.]
Yeah
Ayy, haha
Real talk, nigga
Okay
King shit right here, nigga
That's right
Grand Hustle right here, nigga
That's right
You don't like it—steer clear, nigga
Zone One, Bankhead, nigga
Sunny Hill
This what they waitin' on
Yeah
It's the King, bitch!

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Stacks on my draw, sho'
Walkin' through the mall, blow
20, 30 racks, yeah I have that also
Further more, niggas can't see me like Waldo
Y'all so sick in the head if you even thought so
I'm nine years in this, six of which I've been all flow
Tryin' T.I., suicide like his car door
I'm gettin' big bread, homie only getting small dough
I'm all that and you ain't even all mo'
Hoes say I got a big head 'cause I got a big dick
Don't believe it cuz? I say then, go and ask his bitch
She say she'd never seen stacks this thick
A king of oneself, outfits to match his kicks
Street cred up to here, and swag through the roof
Go google "Clifford Harris" if yo' ass need proof
Pledge allegiance to the swag
No, I don't need to brag but I do
And you just mad 'cause it's true

[Chorus: T.I.]
Welcome back to the trap, and back to the grind
I'm back on my hustle with an immaculate shine
Welcome back to the trap, and back to the streets
Homie, right after I'm released, see me right back with the heat
Welcome back to the trap, and back to the grind
I'm back on my hustle with an immaculate shine
Welcome back to the trap, I'm back on my shit
If this the shit that you missin', come get right back on my dick
Welcome back to the trap

[Verse 2: T.I.]
All they do is motivate, these rappers I could procreate
No debate, thinking it was over for me, your mistake
Vokas pay very close attention to what brokers say
Notice they, way beneath my level, they suppose to hate
Over they, heads so high, flow by
Lil guy couldn't reach if he tried, no lie
And I'm... So fly with no feathers
Parachute of propellers, grab it, it's so jealous
All these clowns wanna see me fall down, no fellas
What does history tell us? By now, you should know better
Spell my name with the same four letters
I'ma rain fo-ever, better get an umbrella, nigga
I suggest you respect my grind
Must follow one rule: "Let T.I. shine"
And I'm never leaving, you just have to adapt
Right now, let me welcome you back to the trap

[Chorus: T.I.]
Welcome back to the trap, and back to the grind
I'm back on my hustle with an immaculate shine
Welcome back to the trap, and back to the streets
Homie, right after I'm released, see me right back with the heat
Welcome back to the trap, and back to the grind
I'm back on my hustle with an immaculate shine
Welcome back to the trap, I'm back on my shit
If this the shit that you missin', come get right back on my dick
Welcome back to the trap

[Verse 1]
I be high when I split a dutch and fill it up
I be high when I get my money doubled up
I be high when a model wanna let me cut
I be high when I'm shinin' cause my diamonds blush

I be low when a nigga can't get away
I be low when I can't seem to make a way
I be low when I can't even feed myself
I be low when I realize I'm by myself

But I be high when I'm shopping for expensive clothes
I be high when I get what I couldn't before
I be high in the club while I'm poppin bub
I be high when I'm cruisin, sittin' on them dubs

But I be low at the shows in my dressing room
I be low when I see that I'm a different dude
I be low on the plane looking at the sky
I be low but my highs keep a nigga tight

[Hook]
I be high, then I be low
I be low, then I be high
It's like a battle knife to a gun fight
But I be cool, this the story of my life
I be high, then I be low
I be low, then I be high
It's like a battle knife to a gun fight
No need to worry, this the story of my life

[Verse 2]
I be low when I gotta get ready for work
I be low cause after bills my pockets be hurt
I be low when I can't take a girl out
I be low cause they can't even figure me out

But I be high when the phony chicks show me love
Cause in my mind I read em' but don't give a fuck
I be high when a nigga get attention
I be high when ya girl catch feelings

Then I be low when I go into the empty space
I be low when I'm lookin' at a stressed face
I be low cause my brother face through hard time
I be low with my nigga ridin close behind
Then I'm high when I know the places we can go
I be high when I think of what the future hold
I be high when she ask for my room number
I be high but my lows keep a nigga humble

[Hook]
I be high, then I be low
I be low, then I be high
It's like a battle knife to a gun fight
But I be cool, this the story of my life
I be high, then I be low
I be low, then I be high
It's like a battle knife to a gun fight
No need to worry, this the story of my life

[Verse 3]
I was high when the label said that I was dope
I was high in my eyes cause I had hope
I was high When I first had the taste of love
I was high when I left the city I was from

And I was low when I had a recent heartbreak
I was low cause I truly thought I had a mate
I was low when I lost her over silliness
I was low cause she twisted what my words meant
But I was high when I finally had the chance to see
Everything that's pretty ain't always good for me
I was high when she first said I like you
Man I must be too high to even write, dude
And these things show you growth
Some niggas show a little
But I'll show you the most

Highs and lows and succeed for sho
The only thing left to do is say a toast
Cause...

[Hook]
I be high, then I be low
I be low, then I be high
It's like a battle knife to a gun fight
But I be cool, this the story of my life
I be high, then I be low
I be low, then I be high
It's like a battle knife to a gun fight
No need to worry, this the story of my life

[Outro]
Now won't you please save Scotty, Lord?
Help me, please
Help me, please

Now won't you please save Scotty, Lord?
Won't you please save Scotty?
Help me, please

They say we killin' 'em all, all, all, all

[Verse 1: Drake]
Hip hop's newest and youngest acquisition
If this was you, I wonder what you'd do in that position
Try to make a profit or try to make a difference
Try to make 'em play your shit or try to make 'em listen
I go from records with Dwele and L.B. and Elzhi
The meetings where they tell me to start making records and that They'll buy
Now I'm out in A-Town
They tellin' me Trey sound
It's too mainstream if I plan on me stickin' around
But the allure of this year's Scream Tour has been cuttin' all them Jawns that be hurtin' the game
I be dreamin' 'bout hoes and doin' them live shows
Shirtless, that's why I started to personal train
Dog, personally mane
I'm a person that came to bring purpose to a seem unless they purposeless game
It never feel like it's earned when you purchase the fame
Now my thoughts gettin' deeper and I'm searchin' the game
I keep on, on, on, on, on

[Drake & Saukrates: Hook]

[Yeah] I'm killin' 'em all, all, all, all

[Yeah] I'm killin' 'em all, all
I'm killin' 'em all, all

[Verse 2: Saukrates]
Yeah
Let me show you how to blast up
Now tell me who is a masta
A mind never wasted
Who grows fasta?
The young and incredible while lightin' yo' ass up
You look a lil' red, we gettin' that cash up
See where we from, the 50's are bloody
And the 100 dollar bill is dirty brown, they love me
I mess up my livin' room, and studio with my money
A G-note is purple, grape juice stains on the front piece of
My lapel, is custom made
You off the rack shit
I'm off the chain, come on
The dogs are loose
And yeah we get our dumb on like San Frisco Bay
With 40 and Mac Dre
Eat it or forever lose a piece of your meal to me or one of my folk
Drake'll give you the deal
If bein' broke at 30 is a nigga that kills
I guess we somethin' like two ice bergs huntin' to kill
Keep on, keep on (Uh), keep on (Uh), keep on (Uh)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Drake]
Look, uh
I used to get 'em like murda murda
Ol' time killin'
I wasn't even rappin', spent my whole time chillin'
And now the girls like
It's only Drake got chased and so the artists I respected try and Take my place
But pimpin' ain't easy man and neither is rappin'
They one in the same when you need it to happen
My city full of players they just needed a captain
In need of him right now in need of him back then
But back then I was actin'
Nowadays I serve backhands with backspin
Tryin' to prove rappers are intelligent black men
And  now whoever chose to back out is back in
They say there's two sides to every story and three when the truth Get told
So grab a spoon 'fore your soup get cold
When you drive it off the lot is when your coupe get old
So please discover an answer 'fore proof gets sold
And keep on, on, on, on, on

[Hook]

[Intro]
Uh-uh, uh-uh
One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, yeah
Uh-uh, uh-uh
One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, yeah
Uh

[Verse 1]
Baby girl, I can't imagine what it's like for you
I got you pregnant, now inside there is a life in you
I know you wonderin' if this is gon' make me think 'bout wifin' you
Like, if you have my first child
Would I spend my whole life with you?
Now, I ain't tryna pick a fight with you, I'm tryna talk
Now, I ain't tryna spend the night with you, I'm kinda lost
See, I've been givin' it some thought lately
And frankly, I feel like we ain't ready and this—
Hold up now, let me finish!
Think about it, baby, me and you, we still kids ourself
How we gonna raise a kid by ourself?
Handle biz by ourself? A nigga barely over twenty
Where the hell we gon' live? Where am I gon' get that money?
I refuse to bring my boy or my girl in this world
When I ain't got shit to give 'em, and I'm not with them niggas
Who be knockin' girls up and skate out
So, girl, you gotta think about how the options weigh out
What's the way out?
Uh

[Chorus]
And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometime, I cry sometimes about it
And girl, I know it hurt, but if this world was perfect
Then we could make it work, but I doubt it
And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometime, I cry sometimes about it
And girl, I know it hurt, but if this world was perfect
Then we could make it work, but I doubt it

[Verse 2]
She said: "Nigga, you got some nerve
To come up to me talkin' about abortion
This my body, nigga, so don't think you finna force shit!
See, I knew that this is how you act, so typical
Said you love me, oh, but now you flippin' like reciprocals
It figures though, I should've known
That you was just another nigga
No different from them other niggas
Who be claimin' that they love you just to get up in them drawers
Knowin' all the right things to say
I let you hit it raw, mothafucka!
Now I'm pregnant, you don't wanna get involved, mothafucka?
Tryna take away a life—is you God, mothafucka?!
I don't think so! This a new life up in my stomach
Regardless if I'm your wife, this new life here, I'ma love it
I ain't budgin', I just do this by my mothafuckin' self
See, my mama raised me without no mothafuckin' help
From a man, but I still don't understand how you could say that
Did you forget all those conversations that we had way back
'Bout your father? And you told me that you hate that nigga
Talkin' about he a coward and you so glad that you ain't that nigga
‘Cause he left your mama when she had you and he ain't shit
And here you go doin' the same shit… You ain't shit, nigga!"

[Chorus]
And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometimes, I cry sometimes about it
And boy, this shit hurts, and ain’t nobody perfect
Still, we can make it work, but you doubt it
And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometimes, I cry sometimes about it
And boy, this shit hurts, and ain’t nobody perfect
Still, we can make it work, but you doubt it

[Verse 3]
They say everything happens for a reason
And people change like the seasons, then grow apart
She wanted him to show his heart and say he loved her
He spoke the magic words and on the same day he fucked her
Now she wide open
She'd put a ring up on his finger if she could
But he loved her ‘cause the pussy good
But she ain't no wife though
Uh-oh! She tellin' him she missed her period, like typos
He panickin', froze up like a mannequin, a life grows
Inside her, and now he askin': "Is it even mine?"
What if this bitch ain't even pregnant? Dog, could she be lyin'?
And she be cryin', ‘cause he actin' distant
Like, "Ever since I told you this, nigga, you actin' different."
And all his niggas sayin', "Man, these hoes be trappin' niggas
Playin' with niggas' emotions like they some action figures."
Swear they get pregnant for collateral, it's like extortion
Man, if that bitch really pregnant, tell her to get a abortion (Uh)
But what about your seed, nigga? (Uh-uh)
But what about your seed, nigga?
But what about your seed, nigga?
But what about your seed, nigga?

[Outro]
And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometime, I cry sometimes about it
And I ain't too proud to tell you
That I cry sometime, I cry sometimes about it
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Yeah hey

[Verse 1]
Bright lights, Big dreams
Nice night or So it seems
Stroll in the club with her tight fit jeans
Praying that she might get seen by a nigga with a contract
With a sports team or just a nigga that you figure could afford things
Like more rings for her fingers
She used to fuck singers but said they too soft, Just copped a new loft
For you walk into her crib got to take her shoes off
Thats only step one your dress is next hun
You say your kid sleep, I don't want no step son
But lead the way to your bed room, king size bed so we got leg room
She give Queen like head so we got head room, my God
Than I work her like its my job
Her moans is like music to my ears iPod

And than I hit the door, cause baby I got to go
Oh yeah don't act like you don't know
I know you've been through this before

[Hook]
Check it, I make the rich bitch beg
Make the good girl steal
Make the old ladies blush
Make the young hoes squeal
For real, for real

[Verse 2]
Good girl huh, father was a preacher
Sent her off to college thought he got her on a leash though
From the outside man them girls be the squeakiest
You get 'em inside them girls be the freakiest

Mischievous, downright devious
Say she want cake I got all the right ingredients
Running round fronting like a pure white virgin
Gave a nigga dome while her father gave a Sermon
Amen, let the choir sing
She be walking round campus like the quiet thing
Some niggas scared to approach when they admiring
Man if they know like I know she got that fire thing
Pour a little OJ with some P-trone
I'm feeling ok, but homie she's gone
When remmy Rev called she just ignore him
I had her calling on God 'til the wee morn
And than I hit the door nigga
Cause baby I got to go
Oh yeah don't act like you don't know
I know you've been through this before

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Sleeping at the top, nightmares of the bottom
Everybody wanna be fly until you swat ‘em
But who am I to talk? I ain’t shittin' roses
We in the same picture but we all got different poses
Now I’m looking in my rear view, I see the world in it
I try to slow down, and I get rear-ended
Pause, like a red light, I’m dead right
Highway to Heaven, God, do you see my headlights?
They say you don’t know what you’re doing 'til you stop doing it
Well, call me clueless 'cause I do this
Attention all shooters: I’m a shooting star
Life is a course, and I'ma shoot for par
Searching for today, instead I found tomorrow
And I put that shit right back, man, I’ll see what I find tomorrow
Young Money, CMR, Blood like a scar
Weezy F. Baby and the "F" ain't for "Flaw"

[Interlude]
Uh, uh
Yep, yep
Yep, yep

[Verse 2]
It's like I have it all, but I don't have to worry
Married to the money, a true love story
Only God can judge me, I don't need a jury
Nothing standing in my way like nothing's my security
Back to my journey, that bullshit don't concern me
If I knew I was going to jail, I would have fucked my attorney
If you sleeping on me, nigga, then I hope you toss and turnin'
I'm so cold I'm hypothermic, ask your bitch, she will confirm it, yeah
Now what we doin' with it?
Keep opening your grill, I'm barbecuin' with it
I know my shit already tight so I ain't screwin' with it
Some say this game is a joke, well I hope they get it
Okay, I'm walking on needles, sticking to the point
Yeah, the streets is talking, I'm familiar with the voice
I'm a gangsta by choice, I hope my sons choose wiser
And don't call me "Sir," call me "Survivor"

[Interlude]
Uh, yeah
Uh, haha
And they go "yep, yep"
Yep, yep

[Verse 3]
Uh, call me "Killer" 'cause I make a killin'
I got this shit wrapped up, bow and a ribbon
That's them twin Glocks, you can call them siblings
And them bullets travel, better hope I keep dribblin'
I touch the sky, get the clouds out my fingernails
These bitches think they fly like Tinkerbell
But they all on my wire like Stringer Bell
I let them be, 'cause you know how the sting’ll feel
Know how to whip that white girl, I can spank her tail
And I fuck up any track: train derail
Know how to roll, never need training wheels
And when the truth hurts, I pop pain pills
Uh, all or nothing or nothing else
I bleed reality, I should cut myself
Just had a bowl of riches, and a cup of wealth
And the "F" is for "Fuck yourself"

[Outro]
Uhh, yeah
And I ain’t doing nothing but getting my share, breathin' this air
And Mack moms told me she gon' keep me in her prayers
So I’m feeling alright, I’m tryna stay aware
And if you wanna trip, then I'ma meet you there
To my niggas in the game, keep the game fair
Players play, coaches coach, and cheerleaders cheer
I’m trying to keep spirit when the ghost disappear
Weezy F. Baby and the "F" ain’t for "Fear," uh

[Verse 1]
I've been roamin' around, always lookin' down at all I see
Painted faces fill the places I can't reach
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
Someone like you and all you know and how you speak
Countless lovers under cover of the street
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody

[Chorus]
Someone like you

[Verse 2]
Off in the night, while you live it up I'm off to sleep
Wagin' wars to shape the poet and the beat
I hope it's gonna make you notice
I hope it's gonna make you notice

[Chorus]
Someone like me
Someone like me
Someone like me
Somebody

[Bridge]
I'm ready now
I'm ready now
I'm ready now
I'm ready now
I'm ready now
I'm ready now
I'm ready now

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Someone like you
Somebody
Someone like you
Somebody
Someone like you
Somebody

I've been roamin' around, always lookin' down at all I see

Hold up, hold up, whoa there
Let's capture this moment (Boy, boy)
If I hit it then I own it, marijuan'-in' every mornin' (We on)

Talk to the, talk to the hand
Bitch, you talking to a grown ass man
It's, like, way-way-way too much up in your pants
For us not to make the bed squeak
(There goes the bed sheets)
Everybody rip the swag off 'fore I rip the tag off
Why my pants sag off? 'Cause I'm rapping my ass off
Flow so ugly, money so handsome
This the fucking anthem, get it? The fucking anthem?
Ah!

[Chorus: Roscoe Dash & Kanye West]
Early in the morning (Morning)

When I know, uh, just because

[Verse 3: Kanye West, Big Sean, & Both]
I don’t really wanna, uh, talk too much shit
But you love it when I talk like I lost it
And I love how you look when you blazin'
And I swear you turn at least half-Asian
And we about to have a liaison
She so cool, give head with her shades on (Whoa)
You should just go and throw a cape on (Whoa)
And it's just so amazing
So amazing, so amazing
Take it to the car, bloop, bloop
That shit look like I'm speed racing
Leavin' with me, it'll boost your reputation
West side is where I'm stationed
Spend all night, just champagne-tasting
Ain't no rush, girl, let's just pace it 'til it's

[Chorus: Roscoe Dash, Big Sean & Both]
Early in the morning (Morning, yeah)
When she's all alone (When she's all alone)
I'ma take my time (Time)

Just to set the mood, girl (Mood)
I brought some Marvin Gaye and Chardonnay
So just let the song play (And I'ma give it to ya)

[Bridge: Big Sean]
I don't give a fuck about anything, that you're telling me
Cause right now it's all, irrelevant, I'm so high I won't, remember it

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
And I wish that this could last forever
But maybe one night is even better
Real nigga mayne, all the people I plotted with
Is the same ones I'm dividin' the profits with
Now I'm in the building like two planes bitch
Kickin' it with my shirt off, on some Liu Kang shit
Sleep with the sun up like I grew fangs bitch
I come alive in the night, on some Bruce Wayne shit
Livin' my life, gettin' high payments
Fuckin' with some new broads and they high maintenance
And they wearin' high heels, trip so we're on high hills
Tits sittin' high, rollin' zips, gettin' high man

[Chorus: Big Sean, Chiddy Bang & Wiz Khalifa]
Everything high
It's time to go

[Bridge: Big Sean]
I don't give a fuck about anything, that you're telling me
Cause right now it's all, irrelevant, I'm so high I won't, remember it

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Cause the penthouse 90 floors up
Make love and then join the mile high club
Yeah I'm on camera, fresh out of a sex scene
I just turn all my nightmares into wet dreams
I'm in a new crib, so big, I'm talkin' town size
Sippin' somethin' cold, smokin' weed by the pound size
Yeah I gotta big head ho, I think it's crown size
Bitch I do it big and I never plan to downsize
People who talk shit, is feelin' like dickheads
Saw me on the web like I had a extra six legs
Lookin' at my highlights with a bitch with highlights
Crowd wavin' at me, all tryna say hi right

[Chorus: Big Sean, Chiddy Bang & Wiz Khalifa]
Everything high
It's time to go

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
If you roll one up, I'mma roll one too
Oh you sayin' you don't smoke? Well that's all that we do
You be up in the club, I be up in the clouds
Ooh, don't gotta ask me if I brought enough cause' we don't run out
Blow it by the O, even my fans smoke it
Cause' they throw it at my shows hidin' it when I travel
In case the police gotta know, rollin' it up in traffic
Make you smoke out of a bong, put you on different hashes
My chick is the baddest, my spliff is the fattest, I'm livin' so lavish
Gotta patch a lil kid tryna get at this cabbage
My pinky ring a V8, I filled it with carrots
I'm popeye with spinach, till' the day I die I'm gettin' high

[Chorus: Big Sean, Chiddy Bang & Wiz Khalifa]
Everything high
It's time to go

[Bridge: Big Sean]
I don't give a fuck about anything, that you're telling me
Cause right now it's all, irrelevant, I'm so high I won't, remember it

[Verse 4: Chiddy Bang]
I'm fly, my swell on Priceline
Truthfully I want this shit to last a lifetime
Simply amazing, we blazin' as we just write rhymes
Cold flow, ice time, breakin' down bright pines
Enough with all the beefin' I'm over it
Outta town kush, but they smokin' that local shit
I always knew that I would be the man
They ride the greyhound, but I'm more a peter pan, we the fam
Off the scale, yeah we about to break the richter quick
Loud, yea it's worth a thousand words on some picture shit
When it comes to smokin' we have a certificate
I know them haters is wishin' we fakin', licorice
Fuck it we up, my nigga Sean gave me another L
I need a high class chick that I match up with well
She familiar with Fendi, comfortable in Chanel
And you know errthang' high when you livin' swell

[Chorus: Big Sean, Chiddy Bang & Wiz Khalifa]
Everything high
It's time to go
Uhm, blacka blacka
Lose a backer, you should back up
Blucka blucka, you should suffer
Lose a mother, motherfucker your mother
Fuck your brother, that fucker died like John Tucker
I'm ruckus, I'm ill, no for real
I'm the only stingray in the water that kills
A bad pill, y'all sweeter than Advils
While I sit on your girl bread like her last meal
I blew up before I grew up
Got introduced to the game, now I'm at they heads like crew cuts
Suit up and lace your boots up
It's war time
It's Weezy Baby, no crime, no lyin'
Y'all motherfuckers slipping, you better hold on
I think they tripping like Cedric and Solange
I flow like I'm headless, no mind
I can say don't rhyme and it's gonna rhyme
Drought

[Tyga]
California the home of a king, the place for an angel
Flyer than doves, was...
I just wana bring the Cali love back

[Hook]
Sitting here thinking when they put Cali on
88 Cube and Dre I wasn't even born
So I just wanna keep cali on
But what happened to the cali love
Cigar smoke when the legends shoot videos
Snoop's getting old and 'Pac is really gone
So I just wanna keep Cali on... but what happened to the Cali love

[Verse 1]
I see artist hate loving this young artist
Critique all them yall ain't nothing but cheap condoms
Fuck all yall those talking but are supporting
I hear your sounds loud & clear your shit sound distorted
How I'm supposed to get on it
I'm one of the next that best does it
Remove your ear plugging I never stutter
Un-t-til now brother my city will now love me
Bet he won't be found clubbing unless his envelopes a hundred
Young Money that big boy money is nothing
Just sit & watch the Sony plasma when you on it
I'm Saint Laurentin' while competition you call them blogging
Bobbin that Cube Sox hat that's that steady mobbin
Cake like Betty Crocker
I shits on ya give your toilet a problem
Child I'm a problem grab your child & hide them
LA's monster from hells surface
Earth Tyga man..nigga what's your purpose

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
A-mazing what niggas do for a little glacier
Ice on your arm leave your body on the pavement
Dr. put some ice on his arm he's swelling crazy
Momma don't wanna hear them organs playing
But momma they hatin'
Momma I made it they faked it
Like Big Tigga in the basement (haha)
Groupies they get it up like a facelift
Face it but your naked
Your royal is clean but I'm no Akeem
I'm more sacred
Plus these hoes basic
Can't do shit but play a PlayStation
Chick about to get hit and run like accidents waiting
Sport ranges
60 I'm gone Nick Cage'n
Hot whips I'm in I'm fresh paper platin
Along with some red kicks made by an asian
Fila nada, Prada I never
I'm an investment​ send it freely into the streets..CC

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]

Now shorty lets get down to business
If you want it, you can get it
All you gotta do is hit me and it's on (and it's on)
I know its been a minute, and you ain't got time for gimmicks
But I'm comin' to my senses, I was wrong (I was wrong)
But when you roll like me, on your own like me
You gonn' wake up all alone and you will see, see, see
I'm at an all time low, we don't talk no more
Cause I want you back, I need you girl, that's all I know

[Hook]
Now talk to me, talk to me, talk
Walk with me, walk with me, walk
I know these things that we said
How can we stop and leave all

[Verse 2]
How can we ruin something so perfect, so fluent
We was young, We was dumb, We ain't know what we was doing
But now that we older, older
Lets take these things slower, slower
Reset the button, button
And start it all over, over
I cannot stop what I feel, You ain't a notch in my belt
I ain't gonna lie to you girl, I want you all to myself
And forgive for being stingy though
Take you all the places that you swear you never been before
Why is this so difficult, This should be the easy part
Believe me if you need me, Ain't no way we finna keep apart

[Verse 3]
No matter where I go, No matter who I'm with
I always think of you, Cause baby you the shhh
I love your body girl, There's no denying that
I will not rest, I will not sleep, like an insomniac
I keep you up all night, You know I get it right
I give it to you fast or slow, Or anyway you like
So give it one more chance
Now how you want it
If we pick up where we parted
We can finish what we started girl

[Intro]
Yeah
All these haters (Shit)
They're just forced to hate, you know, no reason (Fuck y'all)
They ain't really know who I am at all (Fuck y'all ma'fuckers, haha)
So I guess I kinda gotta introduce myself again to these ma'fuckers
So I'm just like, yeah (

[?] do it, Mac)

[Verse 1]
Pleased to meet ya, find me with a heap of reefer (Yup)
Speakin' ether, I'll whip your ass and crease your sneakers (Haha)
Haters, keep the hatin', little faggots figure skatin'
While we figure eightin', seekin' your replacement
And I ain't gon' touch the hate like some bacteria (Nope)
Some nasty-ass food from the cafeteria (Ha)
You'll have and hear me, bruh, if you pass me up at lunch
I'ma beat yo ass, tearin' you in half and eat you up (Yessir)
Like any given Friday, I roll up to your driveway
Rock you in the face, have you lookin' out and sideways
So step back, 'cause you ain't want it with Mac
The young cat with the rap to leave you flat on your back (Haha)
And as a matter of fact, I'm like crack on the track
With my cap to the back, I'm the cat in the hat (Yessir)
Yeah, we rhymin' like Dr. Seuss
So be careful 'fore you end up on the news
Every time that we... (What?)

[Chorus]
Cruise, like we got nothin' to lose
Hear the speech through the speakers, hope it's comin' in smooth
When we cruise, see, I ain't got nothin' to do
So I'ma roll around the city, smokin' blunts with my crew
When we cruise, like we got nothin' to lose
Hear the speech through the speakers, hope it's comin' in smooth
When we cruise, see, I ain't got nothin' to do
So I'ma roll around the city, smokin' blunts with my crew (Let's go)

[Verse 2]
And ain't nobody that do it like Pittsburgh (Nope)
Said, ain't nobody that do it like Pittsburgh (Uh-uh)
I said it twice just in case that you misheard
'Cause this verse like (Sippin' an ounce of sizzurp) (Yeah)
So quit your back talk, I ain't havin' it, boy
Yeah, I'm lookin' fresh right now, straight dazzlin', boy
Light a swisher, now I'm gone (Gone)
What my mind's on, 5's on, laced up, headed out the time bomb
Get your life right, size truck with a white light
Triple X tee and a fresh pair of white Nikes (Haha)
I'm writin' like nobody you've seen
'Cause my weed is purple and my money is green
See, I'm hungry for cream with my fitted on lean
If you wanna talk shit, I'ma shit on y'all's team, yup, ha
I rock my fitted to the side
Roll around the city, blowin' piff up in the sky
When we...

[Chorus]
Cruise, like we got nothin' to lose
Hear the speech through the speakers, hope it's comin' in smooth
When we cruise, see, I ain't got nothin' to do
So I'ma roll around the city, smokin' blunts with my crew
When we cruise, like we got nothin' to lose
Hear the speech through the speakers, hope it's comin' in smooth
When we cruise, see, I ain't got nothin' to do
So I'ma roll around the city, smokin' blunts with my crew

[Verse 3]
The kid raps like lasers, sharp like razors
Rollin' up my weed in some Garcia Vegas, yep (Haha)
Fuck a cop tryin' chase me with tasers
I'm runnin' out my crib, then I'm dippin' through the neighbor's (Peace)
Garden, High homie, Marvin the Martian
I wipe my ass with you soft rappers like Charmin (Bitches)
Y'all hungry, I'm starvin' (Yup)
You talkin' shit, oh, I beg your pardon (Hahaha)
Specifics is never gimmicks, I rip it just how I live it
You want it, I'll go and get it, I'm kickin' it so exquisite
The wickedest motherfucker on the block I live at
Shit talk on hip-hop, I'm peelin' your wig back, yup
So where the crib at? (Oh) Where the party at? (Oh)
Where them butt-naked hoes and the Bacardi at? (Oh)
'Cause when I start to rap, it's game over
And I ain't spend a single day sober
When I...

[Chorus]
Cruise, like we got nothin' to lose
Hear the speech through the speakers, hope it's comin' in smooth
When we cruise, see, I ain't got nothin' to do
So I'ma roll around the city, smokin' blunts with my crew
When we cruise, like we got nothin' to lose
Hear the speech through the speakers, hope it's comin' in smooth
When we cruise, see, I ain't got nothin' to do
So I'ma roll around the city, smokin' blunts with my crew (Cruise)

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
I met this chick in Motor City
And her name was Lexus
Ass out of control and her chest was wreckless
So we exchanged numbers
Plenty calls and texts about gaining
New friends and X-ing our exes
In the back of my mind
I just wanted to sex this
Gotta give her the D
And some pearls as her necklace
So, I had her for dinner
Woke her up for breakfast
Around seven thirteen like Houston, Texas
She’s everything I hoped for in the bedroom
And like Tyra Banks, I need some headroom
Because she can suck a golf ball through a garden hose
I never sat her on the bench, she my starting hose
I'm on point at Game time
Y’all be guardin' hoes
Yeah, she never plays games like the Parker bros
And we be drinking Conjure by the cases
Meanwhile your girl’s been exchanging fuck faces

[Hook: Trey Songz]
You must be used to all the finer things
Infatuated by what money brings
It seems to me, you hoes'll never change
(Hoes won't ever change..)
So all that’s left is for us to exchange..

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I met her at a restaurant
She was a waitress
One day I went in and sat at her table
She asked me what will I be having?
I said "the basics
Well-done steak, vegetables and potatoes”
She asked if I will be having a drink, I said "later"
Bring me a glass of vodka and a chaser
As me and my homie sat and discussed paper
I could feel a fire burning me like a laser
I could see her thighs
Through uniform pants, so I didn’t leave a tip
I left her an advance
Along with my number saying "give me a call"
And you know I didn’t have to leave my name at all!
She called me when she got off
So I invited her to my loft
And she flew over like a moth thing
You know she came straight up outta all of that cloth
We had a couple blunts and some champagne
Then she massaged all of my back pains
Then it became time for her to pack things
I said hit me up again, we do the same thing
Jumped in the shower, got out and saw a text message
It had a smiley face and said “you the best sexy XOXO!”
I replied I love your fuck face

[Trey Songz]
You must be used to all the finer things
Infatuated by what money brings
It seems to me you hoes will never change
(Hoes won't ever change)
So all that’s left is for us to exchange

[Intro]
Finally Famous in this, gettin'
E'rything
I say

[Verse]
I'm still dreaming bigger than I'm living
And just sleeping long enough to dream
Spent long enough in the sheets
It's time to turn it to the real thing
And turn these ideas to milli's, business into buildings
No girlfriend, you're looking for some feelings, find a dentist
Me and my crew toured around the world, shook a million hands
I never made the crowd fans, I made 'em all fam
And came back to the city that made us all men
Except we kings now, reflecting, trying to take it all in
I put the city on my back
So that way if I fall I'm crowd surfing the map
I turn mistakes into lessons, dead ends to exits
On the journey of my life, so I'm inviting y'all to get in
Let's go

[Outro]
Go, go
Go, go, go, go

[Intro: Wilson Pickett]
It's too—it's too late

[Chorus: Big Sean & Siham Hashi]
I hope it's not too late for me
Could you just wait for me, a while
Is it too late, too late?
I hope it's not too late, too late
I hope it's not too late for me
Could you just wait for me, a while?
Is it too late, too late?
I hope it's not too late, too late, oh

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I hope it's not too late (Too late)
I got my whole life packed inside a suitcase
Riding in a Chevy that shoulda been a Mercedes
Tryna keep my head above water, so I stayed out the Navy, I, I
I made a promise to my girl (Girl)
Said "I'ma leave town and bring back the whole world" (World)
So I bought a ticket (Boy,) took longer than expected
Came back around like a necklace and the first thing she said was
"It's too late"
Like "nigga, I got needs too
I found a man that gave me what I need, now I don't need you
I barely got a text, a call back, you old lying ass nigga (Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
You a dog, out here chasing paper, fucking bitches, nah (The hell you talking about now?)
Nah, nigga, you too late (Fuck you, get out)
Live with it, now you got a roommate"
My homie served ten years; it's too late for him to be treated equally
Too late for him to make it out the hood legally
Riding around doing my thing (Thing)
Is it too late to be tryna live dreams (Dreams)
And turn them all real? Reality is just a technicality
So is being fake, so don't tell me that I'm—that I'm too late

[Chorus: Big Sean & Siham Hashi]
I hope it's not too late for me (No)
Could you just wait for me, a while
Is it too late, too late?
I hope it's not too late, too late
I hope it's not too late for me
Could you just wait for me, a while?
Is it too late, too late?
I hope it's not too late, too late, oh

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Too late, yeah
Uh, alarm clock said I'm too late
And they said I'm too weak, I could use a few weights
So they said I took too long
And don't look too strong, well, how long would you take?
Waiting's got me here in the first place
'Nother second, I been second, maybe third in the worst case
Now on display are my word plays
Moving weight, eh, it's such a trap
Move and wait; you can't do that
I know I'm dope, man, but I can't move crack
And it's such a fractured way of thinking 'bout your plans
But I try and bring it back before your brain hit the pan
Sean from Detroit, Lupe from Chicago-land
But both of our chains say made in Japan
German engineers designed both of the sedans
Ride with Mr Right-On-Time or stay Ms Another Chance
Man; redirected at the girls
Not an ultimatum just an option in this world
Where things come and go when the clocks never stop
Be on time for nothing, a little late for a lot, huh

[Chorus: Big Sean & Siham Hashi, Lupe Fiasco]
I hope it's not too late for me (Yeah)
Could you just wait for me, a while
Is it too late, too late?
I hope it's not too late, too late
I hope it's not too late for me
Could you just wait for me, a while?
Is it too late, too late?
I hope it's not too late, too late, oh

[Bridge: Big Sean]
I hope it's not too late
I hope it's not too late
The last thing I wanna hear is too late
Yeah, yeah
Tell me, is it too late for me to try and change the world?
Is it too late to say I wanna change girls?
Is it too late even though I'm the shit?
Is it too late to tell y'all to suck my dick? Bitch

[Outro: Big Sean]
I do it, too late for what
If I want it I need it if I need it I got it
Finally Famous in this, G.O.O.D
Is this how Finally Famous niggas do?

[Verse 1]
I'mma fall through right after this interview
You should call your bitches up, cause I'mma bring my niggas through
We can kick it, baby, if it's good with you
I'm tryna get high, I can bring in like a zip or two
That's how it gets when we just kicking it
That's how it gets when we just kicking it
That's how it gets when we just kicking it
Ain't tryna fuck nothing up, nah, we just kicking it

[Verse 2]
My nigga Jason got cases of light liquor
From last night, if you and your girls act right
We can all get a little tipsy
I mean, we ain't gotta do nothing risky, we just kicking it
That's how it gets when we just kicking it
No need for tripping, we just kicking it
That's how it gets when we be kicking it, we just kicking it

[Verse 3]
You're finger signaling, I'm listening
Leap through the kitchen to a room I fall victim in
Before the gameplay, we do a little scrimmaging
No love involved, she know niggas just kicking it
Yeah, she know that we just kicking it
That's how it gets when we just kicking it
She ain't tripping, we just kicking it
That's how it, when uh, when we kicking it

[Verse 4]
She not a groupie, not a ho, she just a fan
Whose boundaries are crossed simply because I'm the man
And for a single night, she pretends that I'm her man
And ended disappointed, when I'm outtie when it ends
Cause that's how it gets when we just kicking it
That's not my bitch, no we just kicking it
No need to trip cause we just kicking it
That's how it gets when we just kicking it, we just kicking it
That's how it gets when we just kicking it
Salute me gang apprentice-ship, where you can't get no membership

[Outro]
Yeah, Genesis, Rolling Papers, nigga
(He look like he ain't got no stroke, that nigga is wack
(Yeah, I can't fuck with that, fuck you! Fuck him!)

[Verse One]
I looked you in the eyes
I crossed my heart and hope to die
I will never let them cry
I held you in my arms
Said I won't let go until you feel you’re ready
'Til you feel you’re ready

Told me on the phone
Something bout you love me
Ooh baby say it to my face
I could have a place in your world
Kinda like your army, your air force, your peace corps

[Chorus]
So baby follow, follow, follow
Tell me where you want to go
Just keep your body close and don't let go
Follow, follow, follow
Baby let me be the guide
Just listen for the signs
And when I tell you right, left, switch it up
Imma take it slow, Imma take it slow, oh
Oh baby stop there, right there
Don't lose control, don't lose control, oh
Now baby look up at the star
If you wanna go, promise we can go, oh
You just gotta follow, follow, follow
You just gotta follow, follow, follow

[Verse Two]
Oh, baby if you like
We can go to paradise
Be back by the next sunrise
And no, I won't stay in Rome
I never go faster the limit, not unless you with it

And you told me on the phone
Said you wanna love me
Well baby tell me how it feels
Gotta have place in your world
Something like no other, your lover, your best friend, oh

[Chorus]
So baby follow, follow, follow
Tell me where you want to go
Just keep your body close and don't let go
Follow, follow, follow
Baby let me be the guide
Just listen for the signs
And when I tell you right, left, switch it up
Imma take it slow, Imma take it slow, oh
Oh baby stop there, right there
Don't lose control, don't lose control, oh
Now baby look up at the star
If you wanna go, promise we can go, oh
You just gotta follow, follow, follow
You just gotta follow, follow, follow

[Bridge]
Left, right, switch it up
Oh, we gotta pick it up now, slow it down
Hell yeah, switch it up
No we just can't let it fall down
Gotta keep it that, that, that, that
I can never quite get enough
Gotta keep your back arched up
Follow the leader, baby girl
It's going down, down, down
Down down down

[Alternate Chorus]
Now move it right, left, switch it up
Imma take it slow, Imma take it slow, oh
Oh baby baby stop there, right there
Don't lose control, don't lose control, oh
Now baby look up at the star
If you wanna go, promise we can go, oh
You just gotta follow, follow, follow
You just gotta follow, follow, follow

[Verse 1]
Damn, I never pictured this
I'm so high, this shit's ridiculous
Where did I put my shit?
Wait, wait, okay, here it is
As I light this place up
Just me alone, so the joints get faced up
Floating through the stars, my whole nights all spaced up
And my thoughts tryna build my place up
Phones buzzing, so I reach and try and read it
But my visions kinda blurry, so I really can't see it
Something important, it might be it
Or maybe a bitch that don't need shit
Close my eyes and the shit that I'm seeing
Is the reason that I be in the moods that I be in
Damn, I'm really baked, I can't tell if I'm asleep or I'm awake
I'll just sit and wait, yeah, I'll just sit and wait

[Interlude: Tyler]
Domo, nigga, open the fucking door, nigga
Shit, we got shit to do come the fuck on, it's cold nigga

[Verse 2]
Let me try to sober up
Throw some water on my face, only if it's cold enough
Confidently wiping my face with my shirt
Looking in the mirror like that ain't work, damn

[Interlude: Tyler]
Domo, open the fucking door, what the fuck are you doing?
It's not funny no more, I'm cold as fuck nigga
I ain't got no inhaler nigga, shit, open up

[Verse 3]
Okay, I'm coming
Walking to the door and I seem to notice something
The floor is just a cloud of smoke and I'm running
Reaching at the end of the cloud and I'm jumping
Flowing through the air just about to hear something
Feel a lil shake and my body start buzzing like

[Outro: Tyler]
Nigga, you good? (Yeah, I'm cool, dog)
Talking in your sleep and shit nigga, you tripping (Shit, my bad)

[Intro: Bob Marley]

[Domo Genesis]
Yeah, even tho I can't see from the position which I'm standin
We gon' make it to the top and we gon' fuckin crash land it
See it in my dreams, I just finally understand it
I am living this shit out exactly how my visions planned it
No time for that dormant shit, nah I'm high flying
We gon' get on this shit or we gon' die trying
But I got a lotta livin left, so I'm high grindin
My shades on through the night cause I can see my light shinin
What up tho, especially to the ones that really hate it
Shout out to the bitches coming 'round once we make it
I'm glad I could be around to see you up at your fakest
Assures me on what side of this shit I need to keep my placement
I'll never let you niggas get my soul
My heart is just another story, it's never been told
This ain't no Drake shit, and that crying's getting old
I realized my faith, my desicions are getting bold
And love is time consuming, so these bitches get me cold
I apologize for the wait, now let them papers roll
Or maybe that's just me, submersed behind the smoke
Promised momma I'll do it, so fuck it, here it go
Make all these blogs and critics feel the young nigga flow
The floor plan, left on the ground, is where I drew it
I guess these the same grounds, where I had to prove it
The strit I stress so much about, told you I'd do it

[Intro]
Ok it Wiz Khalifa
Its Gucci ah, Drumma
Mary Jane, hit a fews times
Cause I'm 2 times it's Gucci 2 times

[Verse 1 - Gucci Mane]
I'm "Mister Make Her Stare"
Think we make a tear
Last night was a blur, least I wore fur
I pulled up in the rear, engine in the rear
End of the night was pulling on her hair I really
Don't care the games unfair Gucci Mane La Flare
Who gives a care about niggas over there?
Shawty got a pear: apple with a gap
I think we make a pair, she like em from the trap
I got her in the chair she think she in the lear
The way I'm switchin' gears, got her takin' off her heels
I'm Mr. Get Her There, take your underwear, you fuckin
With a boss no need for fuckin with a square

[Hook]
I light the weed up, and hit it two times
Smoke is so good I hit it few times
If I hit her once I hit her two times
If I did it once I can do two times

[Verse 2 - Wiz khalifa]
Oh I got a joint burnin here real slow

Yo bitch want me to save her u betta tame her of get a leash

Outro (u all ready kno wat it is wen I hook u wit da homie t-pain

Oh dis wuz dunn by a gurl luv ya

[Verse 1]
It's 12:07 and I'm thinking 'bout him (thinking 'bout him)
8 minutes ago it was all okay, yeah
I wish the year was just missing one day
I'm wishing I could forget it
'Cos it's still so hard to live with it

[Pre-Hook]
I'm humming to the song playing in my head when I first met you
And I'm looking through the pictures in the shoebox under my bed
And I swear, every conversation that I have
Someone brings up your name, just this one day I don't know
Maybe if I board a plane, I could be at the sunrise
Better yet grab a hammer and start breaking the clocks (those damn clocks)
No, I don't wanna think about him
I don't wanna dream about him
I don't wanna talk about him
I don't wanna call him
This day doesn't even exist
I keep praying that it won't exist no more

[Hook]
Click-clicking my heels wishing away the day
Wish it could have been Tuesday, just not today
Could have been Wednesday, just not today, day
I'm clicking my heels wishing away the day
Wishing the day go away, day go away, today go away

[Verse 2]
It's 6:47 still thinking 'bout him (thinking 'bout him)
Walking on 42nd tryna' clear my brain (no, oh)
He packed his luggage and he left, but some of it still remains
So for 24 hours I'll been sitting here staring at his baggage in my space

[Pre-Hook]
I'm humming to the song playing in my head when I first met you
And I'm looking through the pictures in the shoebox under my bed
And I swear, every conversation that I have
Someone brings up your name, just this one day I don't know
Maybe if I board a plane, I could be at the sunrise
Better yet grab a hammer and start breaking the clocks (those damn clocks)
No, I don't wanna think about him
I don't wanna dream about him
I don't wanna talk about him
I don't wanna call him
This day doesn't even exist
I keep praying that it won't exist no more

[Hook]
Click-clicking my heels wishing away the day
Wish it could have been Tuesday, just not today
Could have been Wednesday, just not today, day
I'm clicking my heels wishing away the day
Wishing the day go away, day go away, today go away

[Bridge]
See I don't even wanna think about him
Or dream about him
Even just one day is one too long
There ain't no sense in bringing it up or bringing memory round
'Cause ain't no getting back the love is gone
I won't be crying no more no water will fall
The storm has passed and gone
And I wish amnesia would stay
I don't wanna remember, not even for just one day

[Hook]
Click-clicking my heels wishing away the day
Wish it could have been Tuesday, just not today
Could have been Wednesday, just not today, day
I'm clicking my heels wishing away the day
Wishing the day go away, day go away, today go away

[Verse 1]
I'm running from the man, I'm running from my flag
I made love to my lady before I packed
I left her while she slept
I put eighty-seven grand cash in the glovebox
I left the keys to the car by the bed
'Cos I got her

[Hook]
Oh, I wish she could be the Bonnie to my Clyde
But I won't risk her life for mine
No oh, not for mine
No Bonnie, no Bonnie, I'm sorry, so sorry

[Verse 2]
I'm running water through my hands
And flipping pictures in my head of her
I wish I taught the girl how to shoot a gun
So I wouldn't worry as much
Oh, last night
I put eighty-seven grand cash in the glovebox
I left the keys to the car by the bed
'Cos I got her
(I got you, oh)

[Hook]
Oh, I wish she could be the Bonnie to my Clyde
(I wis you could be my Bonnie)
But I won't risk her life for mine
(Won't risk your life)
No oh, not for mine
No Bonnie
Oh, I wish she could be the Bonnie to my Clyde
(I know you love me)
But I won't risk her life for mine
(You wanna be where I am, but no, girl)
No oh, not for mine
No Bonnie, no Bonnie

[Bridge]
The money should last awhile
But I know without a dime she got me
When the feds come around she got me
No snitching allowed from my baby

[Hook]
Oh, I wish she could be the Bonnie to my Clyde
(My Bonnie)
But I won't risk her life for mine
(My Bonnie)
No oh, not for mine
No Bonnie
(No Bonnie)
Oh, I wish she could be the Bonnie to my Clyde
(Oh girl, I wish you could be mine)
But I won't risk her life for mine
(Won't you risk your life, no Bonnie, your life)
No oh, not for mine
No Bonnie, no Bonnie, I'm sorry, so sorry

[Outro]
So sorry
So sorry
No Bonnie

[Intro]
I want to see you work out for me, work out for me

[Chorus]
Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then

[Bridge]
Let me see you get high, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)
High, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)

[Verse 1]
She like them boys with the big ol' chains
Ridin' around town in a big ol' Range
I knew her when I rocked big ol' jeans
Now the little nigga doin' big ol' thangs
Would you look at that? I came back for her
Just to give it to ya, like you asked for it
Man, that thing in them jeans too fat for her
Rebounds so I caught her off the backboard
I told her: “Baby girl, come here
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there.”
And I brag hardly, but just to show up at this party
I made what yo' nigga make in one year
That's unfair, but so is life, take a chance, roll the dice
Money can’t buy you love, 'cause it’s overpriced
Don’t overthink, just hope it's right
I’m only here for the night

[Chorus]
Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then

[Bridge]
Let me see you get high, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)
High, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)

[Verse 2]
Carolina Blue kicks, fresh on the scene
Hottest nigga on the block
Damn, girl, you're mean
They be startin' shit, but it’s yo' world
On my Martin shit: “You go, girl!”
She bad and she know it
Some niggas save hoes, I’m not that heroic
Could you be my escort?
'Cause just like them two door Fords
Damn, they don’t make 'em like you no more
Cole World, real Cole World
Them boys cool—me, I’m on fire
Know what's on my mind
Tryna see what's on yours tonight, tonight, tonight
Move slow, 'cause you wanna live fast
Up late so you'll probably skip class
Life is a test so before the night pass, get right, get right

[Chorus]
Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then (Cole World)

[Outro]
Straight up, now tell me
Do you really wanna love me forever? (Oh oh oh)
Or is it just a hit-and-run?
(Well, hey) Straight up, I tell ya
I just really wanna cut when we together (Oh oh oh)
Come here, girl, let's get it on!
(Work out for me)
Straight up, now tell me
Do you really wanna love me forever? (Oh oh oh)
Or is it just a hit-and-run?
Well straight up, I tell ya
I just really wanna cut when we together (Oh oh oh)
Come here, girl, let's get it on!
(Work out for me)

[Intro]
Ehh, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Hope you see
It won't mean a thing to me
I've been doing this too long
Baby girl, I've felt it all (Ooh)
So watch out
If you try to play your luck (Ooh)
Ain't nobody gonna care enough
To catch you fall

[Hook]
So don't you fall in love
Don't make me make you fall in love
Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me
Nobody needs to fall in love
I swear I'm just a bird
Girl, I'm just another bird
Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me
Like me (Like me) (Ohh)

[Verse 2]
You tried
You tried to warn me
But, baby, I'm warning you
Girl, I'll show you
This is no game
You'll be falling to the point of no return
No return

[Hook]
Don't you fall in love
Don't make me make you fall in love
Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me
Nobody needs to fall in love
'Cause I'm just a bird (Ahh)
Girl, I'm just another bird (Woo)
Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me
Nobody needs to fall in love

[Bridge]
I know you're rolling hard with it, don't lie
I know it's got a hold of you
I know you're rolling with it
Baby, don't you lie, baby
I know you're rolling hard with it, don't lie
I know it's got a hold of you
I know you're rolling with it
Baby, don't you lie, baby

[Outro]
So don't you fall in love
Don't make me make you fall in love
Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me
Like me
'Cause, girl, I'm just a bird
Girl, I'm just another bird
Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me
Like me

[Intro]
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say, they say, they say
They say ... y’know a lot of stuff, y'know what I mean?
Don't know what I coulda been
If I wasn't doin' this thing right here
Shit, yo

[Verse 1]
If I wasn't rappin', I'd probably be wrastlin'
Hand-to-hand grapplin' on the corner of Madison
Or real-estatin’, tryin’ to sell you a mansion
Or rollerbladin’, doin’ 360 flatspins
Or I'd probably be flippin’ a burger
Attemptin’ a murder, or paralyzed sippin' on Gerber
I could be workin’ at Jewels, chain-snatchin’, jerkin' your jewels
Homeless, workin’ for food
I might be cleanin’ your pool, teachin’ your school, preachin’ to fools
Leechin', smokin' weed to be cool
At DMVs, holdin' lines up
Or wind up in line-ups, time's up
Full of holes in a hole in a fine tux
Out on parole, out of control, holdin' your dime up
I could be lazy, sittin' on your couch
Or I could be crazy, cussin' pigeons out

[Chorus]
I could be hustlin' bags, strugglin' bad
If I wasn't up in the lab, shit, I just might be
Cuttin' your grass, walkin' your dog
Pumpin' your gas, or nothin' at all
I could be hustlin' bags, strugglin' bad
If I wasn't up in the lab, shit, I just might be
Cuttin' your grass, walkin' your dog
Pumpin' your gas, or nothin' at all

[Verse 2]
I could be thankin' the Academy
A friend of the family, your man deliverin' bail
Or I could be the man that delivers your mail
Or I could be takin' the stand, trickin' on L
This could be my third life, on my third strike
On my third wife, or garbage on my first mic
I could've got off easy, that nigga deserved life
Or the Orkin man, searchin' for termites
I could be stickin' up convenience stores
Or twistin' up what you fiendin' for
Gettin' buck with the meanest whores that been givin' up
On top of a buildin', leanin' forward, with no wings to soar with
They could've kidnapped my daughters
Been extorted for a couple of Porsches
I might be drunk from the Mo', stumblin' slow
Someone to know, runnin' the show, or shovelin' snow, shit

[Chorus]
I could be hustlin' bags, strugglin' bad
If I wasn't up in the lab, shit, I just might be
Cuttin' your grass, walkin' your dog
Pumpin' your gas, or nothin' at all
I could be hustlin' bags, strugglin' bad
If I wasn't up in the lab, shit, I just might be
Cuttin' your grass, walkin' your dog
Pumpin' your gas, or nothin' at all

[Verse 3]
I could be startin', guardin', or plantin' a garden, or security guardin'
Or I could be starvin' and eatin' out your garbage
And found stardom starrin' in sitcoms with Martin
I could've been marchin' with Martin
Handcuffed, North Face over the face with no comment
I might not even be dark-skinned
I might not even be conscious, comatose from a overdose
A R&B singer blowin' the notes
A tailor sewin' a coat, a sailor rowin' a boat
I could've boxed a little, fought for the title
Lost and lost my vitals on the way to the hospital
I could've lost my business
Won the lotto and lost my ticket
I could be the last one to cross the finish, shit
I could be you, I could be him
You could be me, we all got a job to do

[Chorus]
Shit, I just might be
Cuttin' your grass, walkin' your dog
Pumpin' your gas, or nothin' at all
I could be hustlin' bags, strugglin' bad
If I wasn't up in the lab, shit, I just might be
Cuttin' your grass, walkin' your dog
Pumpin' your gas, or nothin' at all
I could be hustlin' bags, strugglin' bad
If I wasn't up in the lab, shit, I just might be
Cuttin' your grass, walkin' your dog
Pumpin' your gas, or nothin' at all

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside, she is free

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & (John Lennon)]
She (We gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving (Sacrificed most of our lives)
Home (We gave her everything money could buy)
She's leaving home after living alone (Bye-bye)
For so many years

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband, Daddy, our baby's gone
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & (John Lennon)]
She (We never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
Home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home after living alone (Bye-bye)
For so many years

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & (John Lennon)]
She (What did we do that was wrong)
Is having (We didn't know it was wrong)
Fun (Fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
Something inside that was always denied (Bye-bye)
For so many years

[Outro]
She's leaving home (Bye-bye)

[Intro]
Can't buy me love, love
Can't buy me love

[Verse 1]
I'll buy you a diamond ring, my friend
If it makes you feel alright
I'll get you anything, my friend
If it makes you feel alright
'Cause I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love

[Verse 2]
I'll give you all I've got to give
If you say you love me too
I may not have a lot to give
But what I got I'll give to you
I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love

[Chorus]
Can't buy me love, everybody tells me so
Can't buy me love, no-no-no, no!

[Verse 3]
Say you don't need no diamond rings
And I'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want the kind of things
That money just can't buy
I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love
Ow!

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Buy me love, everybody tells me so
Can't buy me love, no-no-no, no!

[Verse 4]
Say you don't need no diamond rings
And I'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want the kind of things
That money just can't buy
I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love

[Chorus]
Can't buy me love, love
Can't buy me love

Take my belt off, bitch I'm Pootie Tang
Tippy tow, tippy tay, you gon' get a tip today
Fuck that, you gon' get some dick today

And it got an attitude, no wonder why it's stuck up
Pop it then backflip, yo gymnastics got me ecstatic
Your whole crew look like a pageant

'Cause I'm in love with that ass

T Raw, T Raw, T Raw, T Raw
I don’t give a fuck at all
I don’t give a fuck at all

[Verse 1]
Last king, golds on my collarbone
Fresh, got that Immortal Technique flow
Tech N9ne’s, tech decks
Fingerboards - flip a bitch
Thailand - pick a bitch
It's my land, I take a shit anywere
Skat and piss, Lazereth king of
The snapback habitat, flashback
Flash bangs leave you fuckin trapped
Leave your face swoll
Leave a cabbage patch punching bag
Doctor Seuss niggas: you’s a pussy, Cat in a Hat
Rolling the papers like Wiz papers
Cash takers, put you in a cast
Cause your pocket’s breaking
The heart breaker, fuck her once, never date her
The Money-chaser, no chaser, fuck the savings
I got that ready, jelly
Spread it to all my niggas
So they spend it, spend it
Like "Ring Around The Rosie"
Okie-dokey got a bad Spanish bitch like Kobe
The most low-key, nigga you don’t know me

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Like Cam Newton, I’m #1
Hand-picked my hand guns
I'mma Cowboy like Marion
Barber cut your hair for fun
Oh-two: I’m on one, 105 to Compton
YG just hit me said these bitches got their tats done
With my name on em: that’s a damn shame
Cause I changed homie: I changed my damn name
To T-raw, don’t look at me
Get chopped like butcher meat
Gold chains like Mr. T
Your girl face in my toilet seat
My niggas they be trippin
Your shit's weak, but boy
You ain't different
My show outsold your show by a million
Ya’ll mini me’s, I’m prolific
I progress, no stress
More sex: she gonna give it
No Robin Givens
I fucked that ho
Now its fuck that ho
Sleeping on me:
Don’t you ever get too comfortable

[Intro: Ash Riser]
We're far from good, not good from far
Ninety miles per hour down Compton Boulevard
With the top down, screamin', "We don't give a fuck"
Drink my forty-ounce of freedom while I roll my blunt
'Cause the kids just ain't alright

[Interlude: Ab-Soul]
Oh shit, nigga
Somethin' 'bout to happen
Nigga, this shit, nigga, this sound like thirty keys under the Compton court building
Hope the dogs don't smell it

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Welcome to vigilante, '80s, so don't you ask me
I'm hungry, my body's antsy, I rip through your fuckin' pantry
Peelin' off like a Xanny, examine my orchestra
Granny said when I'm old enough, I'll be sure to be all I can be
You niggas Marcus Camby, washed up
Pussy, fix your panties, I'm Mr. Marcus, you gettin' fucked, uh
You ain't heard nothin' harder since Daddy Kane
Take it in vain, Vicodins couldn't ease the pain
Lightning bolts hit your body, you thought it rained
Not a cloud in sight, just the shit that I write
Strong enough to stand in front of a travelin' freight train, are you trained?
To go against Dracula, draggin' the record industry by my fangs
AK clips, money clips, and gold chains
You walk around with a P90 like it's the '90s
Bullet to your temple, your homicide'll remind me

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & RZA]
That Compton Crip niggas ain't nothin' to fuck with
Bompton Pirus ain't nothin' to fuck with
Compton éses ain't nothin' to fuck with
But they fuck with me, and bitch, I love it
Woop-di-woop, woop-di-woop-woop, woop-di-woop
Woop-di-woop, woop-di-woop-woop (California Dungeons)
Woop-di-woop, woop-di-woop-woop, woop-di-woop
Woop-di-woop, woop-di-woop-woop (California Dungeons)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Let's hit the county buildin', gotta cash my check
Spend it all on a forty-ounce to the neck
And in retrospect, I remember December being the hottest
Squad cars, neighborhood wars, and stolen Mazdas
I tell you motherfuckers that life is full of hydraulics
Up and down, get a six-four, better know how to drive it
I'm drivin' on E with no license or registration
Heart racin', racin' past Johnny because he's racist
1987, the children of Ronald Reagan
Rake the leaves off your front porch with a machine blowtorch (I'm really out here, my nigga)
He blowin' on stress, hopin' to ease the stress (Like, really out here)
He coppin' some blow, hopin' that it can stretch
Newborn massacre
Hoppin' out the passenger with calendars 'cause your day comin'
Run him down and then he gun him down, I'm hopin' that you fast enough
Even the legs of Michael Johnson don't mean nothin', because

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & RZA]
Compton Crip niggas ain't nothin' to fuck with
Bompton Pirus ain't nothin' to fuck with
Compton éses ain't nothin' to fuck with
But they fuck with me, and bitch, I love it
Woop-di-woop, woop-di-woop-woop, woop-di-woop
Woop-di-woop, woop-di-woop-woop (California Dungeons)
Woop-di-woop, woop-di-woop-woop, woop-di-woop
Woop-di-woop, woop-di-woop-woop (California Dungeons)

[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar & Ab-Soul]
Can't detour when you at war with your city, why run for it?
Just ride with me, just die with me, that gun store right there
When you fight, don't fight fair, 'cause you'll never win
(Right, I had the yopper, and I tore they ass up)
Can't detour when you at war with your city, why run for it?
Just ride with me, just die with me, that gun store right there
When you fight, don't fight fair, 'cause you'll never win, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]

Ooh, yeah, yeah
Oh
Hey, yeah
Oh
Hey

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj, Angel De-Mar]
Look, babe boy, you must got Nicki twisted
I woulda left before, but you insisted (Oh)
Said that I was your all and I believed you
That's why it hurts to the core, I gotta leave you (Ooh)
How could you love me and humiliate me? (Humiliate me)
You ain't my man, don't affiliate me (Don't affiliate me)
With all your plans 'cause you really made me (Really made me)
A little bitch, when that really ain't me
Mondays was the fun days (Yeah)
From the slum to the runway, runs in the Hyundai
Niggas didn't have your money? It was gun play
Used to tell me to listen to what a thug say (Ooh)
At night, I would sleep on you (Sleep on you)
And I guess I did sleep on you (Sleep on you)
'Cause when they said it, I said, "Creep on who?" (Uh-huh)
No, not my boo, ain't what he gon' do (Woo)

[Chorus: Angel De-Mar]
Oh, now you wanna be with me (Be with me)
But you can't be with me (Be with me)
Boy, leave me alone (Lone)
You know you did me wrong
So I gotta letcha go
If you wanted me in your life (Me in your life)
Then you shoulda treated me right (Treated me right)
Boy, leave me alone (Lone)
You know you did me wrong
So I gotta letcha go

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Why you sayin' you ain't feel her? (Huh?)
You was in the villa (What?)
She was in the white chinchilla
You was sippin' on a Miller
My bitch Pam' (Kyuh) had the hidden cam like Killa (Woo)
Funny how you win some, you lose some (Ah-ha)
Never worry where your income would come from
'Cause no matter where you was, I held you down
Up north to uptown, so how you sound?
Now you all up in my face, 'bout, "You make mistakes" (Ah-ha)
If I'd've known you was fake, I'd've laced your steak (Uh-huh)
Strychnine, one time, in your Welch's Grape
Quit lying, why you lying? (Why?) I watched the tape, nigga
Now get up out my dressing room (Room)
Give me some effin' room (Room)
Go get your mind right, and take it as a lesson learned
Just like Usher, nigga, you gon' have to let it burn (Burn)
To the left and I ain't talkin' about Jigga girl (Woo)

[Chorus: Angel De-Mar]
Oh, now you wanna be with me (Be with me)
But you can't be with me (Be with me)
Boy, leave me alone (Lone)
You know you did me wrong
So I gotta letcha go
If you wanted me in your life (Me in your life)
Then you shoulda treated me right (Treated me right)
Boy, leave me alone (Lone)
You know you did me wrong
So I gotta letcha go

[Outro: Angel De-Mar]
Yeah, yeah
I gotta letcha go
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, oh

[Verse 1]
I do not talk, I am just a rapper
I am just a rapper
Gambino keep it jumping
These niggas don't know nothing
I keep a girl shaky like her pussy lips is krumping
It's that dude that don't say shit
Leave the ad-libs at the door
Because I am just a rapper like the condoms on my floor
Nigga look at me
Man, yeah I'm all geeked out
Got the tortoise shell frames, Tom Ford pea coat
I'm a lot more dope, I'm a lot more fly
And my wallet stay fat, but I starve my tie
Yeah, these girls loose change
Gotta spend those dimes
Haven't seen real niggas in a long ass time
Nigga I'm so stange, so weird, unusual
Sipping on that whiskey, it's a brain cell funeral
I'll tell you why I'm different, I do this like a nun
Cause I don't give a fuck, I do this shit for fun
A nigga All That like I'm hanging out with Kel
Yes, I hit her g-spot, so I ring her Taco Bell
I got a lot of swagger, lets me get away with all of it
Like I ate a turd, real shit is all I nigga spit
I don't play around with these women, I might fuck a bitch
The game's a corporation and your nigga's Erin Brockovich
I'm murdering this beat as if nobody was watching me
Rapping over Grizzly Bear and now these hipsters sponsor me
My mouth is this good, just imagine what my dick can do
Force Feed Radio, bitch that's what you're listening to

[Verse 2]
My girl wears Pampers, I fuck the shit out of her
'Bout to blow up, yeah my swag is the Challenger
These Scrubs are reclusive, J.D, Salinger
March on these niggas like they fucking with the calendar
If I wasn't this good, how the fuck did I get this far?
Gambino stay fly. So up, I'm Pixar
Hold up dude, I think you made a mistake
Don't forget to mention me with Wale, Cudi and Drake bitch

[Produced by No I.D.]

[Verse 1]
I know your tears more than you cause I see them so much
That's what happens when you're here with no trust
Okay, I lied, cheated, you cried
You done worse shit and I'm still here right
And motherfuck your friends, all them hoes hating
If you're not down then what's your location
I called and checked in every night and that was not probation
They gave they two cents and we ain't ask for no donation
Man you on some other other shit
Just found out about my other other bitch
Went from I love you to you don't know who you fucking with
Fresh off a vaca' and already need another trip
She said I had enough tries
Oh, and I'm the reason that she doesn't trust guys
What's the perfect girl if it's not the perfect time
If you wanna leave fine

[Hook]
Just don't tell me you love me
You're gonna make it too hard for me
I wish you were ugly
It wouldn't be so hard to leave
Cause baby I hate to love you
I can't make up my mind
Cause right when I tell you it's over
By the end of the night I be right back in bed with you
I be right back in bed with you
So don't tell me you love me

[Verse 2]
Wishing I would've tried more, she wanted the truth
Truthfully I wish I lied more cause when I was true
All I heard was "bye" more, "fuck you"
"Who is that" and "I don't know why" more (Shut da fuck up)
We were picture perfect and I tore it all apart
But if I pick up all the pieces we could still be a collage
Feeling like we ended too soon
Used to stay home and do it in all the rooms
Back shots, I know what you like
Had you hitting high notes and you ain't even need no autotune
Nights I was Patron'd up
Girls dressed alike looking like they cloned up
Same nights I wouldn't pick my phone up
And you was thinking damn boy grow up
And I could still hear her leaving
Crazy when a heart breaks it never breaks even
I even found another girl that's perfect
And I'm the only reason we're not working
Cause what's the perfect girl if it's not the perfect time
And if you wanna stay fine

[Hook]
Just don't tell me you love me
You're gonna make it too hard for me
I wish you were ugly
It wouldn't be so hard to leave
Cause baby I hate to love you
I can't make up my mind
Cause right when I tell you it's over
By the end of the night I be right back in bed with you
I be right back in bed with you
So don't tell me you love me

[Outro]
So don't tell me you love me
Whatever you do whatever you do

[Hook]
Yes I do love money
Keep my whole clique stuntin’
Nothing but them hundreds
Keep them ones, don’t want em..

Yes I do love money
Keep my whole clique stuntin’
Nothing but them hundreds
Keep them ones, don’t want em..

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
L-O-V-E M-O-N-E-Y
Cop the True Religion tee
And threw 300 in the sky
Polo shoes on my feet
And my pants are saggin’
Looking so pretty
You would’ve thought I was a faggot
Watch the hood get it
Cook it like chicken
And I got the combo
And it came with biscuits
And I got the combo (Respect in here)
And it came with biscuits (SOD)

[Soulja Boy (Big Sean)]
Yes I do love money
Keep my whole clique stuntin’
Nothing but them hundreds
Keep them ones, don’t want em..

Yes I do love money
Keep my whole clique stuntin’
Nothing but them hundreds
Keep them ones, don’t want em..

Yes I do love money (Yes, I Do)
Yes I do love money (B-I-G Sean Don Nigga)
Keep my whole clique stuntin’ (Yea that's right, Sean Don)
Yes I do love money (Yes, I Do, Detroit)
Keep my whole clique stuntin' (Oh my, GOD)
Yes I do love money (Oh My, GOD)
Nothing but them hundreds (Finally Famous, Gettin)
Keep them ones, don’t want em.. (Boi, Boi,Boi, I Do It)

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Why everything green is good for me?
I'm what these bitch ass niggas couldn’t be
6 miles that’s just the hood in me
Peep my ghetto poetry
I'm getting high and rappin’: that’s flowetry
Is that a green carpet? Now the whole floor a tree
I swear to God ain't no ho in me
But I'm in hoes
I'm probably in your ho
Aw shit there go a staple
At least you know my bitch centerfold
I belong in the Guinness
From most style I rented
Don’t fuck with these niggas
Im fuckin they misses
Im stacking my money
My money get interest
My interest get business
My business get bitches
B-I-G Bitch, I do it, Boi

[Chorus]
Even through the joy I feel the pain
Even in the sun I feel the rain
Even when I’m high I feel the lows
Like that's all I know
And Lord knows I can't complain
But even when I do it feels the same
I’m getting high just to fight the lows
Cause that's all I know

[Verse 1]
Yeah, school girl, cool girl
You dressing sexy and your mama is a cougar
So she let you do the grown folks thang
Let you hang with them boys and they play you like a fool, girl
You got your new hair, it look so good
You write the same nigga's name in your notebook
You know the same one from class, the one you let smash
Now you see him 'round school and he won't look
Now girl you is fine, ain't no doubt about it
But why else you think he hit it and forgot about it?
It's cause your mind don't match what your ass got
But cheer up, you gotta be your own mascot
You see you're lookin' for a man like you need somebody
Get your ass off of Twitter, you could be somebody
A doctor, a rock star, baby live life
But you rather wet up all your pillows all night thinking...

[Chorus]
Even through the joy I feel the pain
Even in the sun I feel the rain
Even when I’m high I feel the lows
Like that's all I know
And Lord knows I can't complain
But even when I do it feels the same
I’m getting high just to fight the lows
Cause that's all I know
That's all I know, that's all I know
That's all I know, that's all I...

[Bridge]
Hey cheer up!
Ey lil' mama, cheer up!
You got your whole life to live, ey why you wanna tear up?
Don’t let them lil' boy come but do some when they try push up
Hey, hey

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living, should I blast myself?
Don't even wanna get out the bed
I got the Glock to my head, feel I rather be dead
Hey, am I hopeless? Raised with rats and roaches
Never liked them teachers, couldn't stand my coaches
Ask "what's the matter?" but you can't relate
Living the life that you hate but you can't escape
Feel like I’m stuck here, that's why I don't give a fuck here
There's no luck here, nobody to trust here
My own mother, yeah I love her
But things I heard as a child under my covers
Left me with scars, it was hard to see her suffer
Darkened my heart and I don't know if I’ll recover
I'm going under and as I'm headed out the front door
She said she proud of me and I wonder what for?
And once more

[Chorus]
Even through the joy I feel the pain
Even in the sun I feel the rain
Even when I’m high I feel the lows
Like that's all I know
And Lord knows I can't complain
But even when I do it feels the same
I’m getting high just to fight the lows
Cause that's all I know
That's all I know, that's all I know
That's all I know, that's all I...

[Bridge]
Hey cheer up!
Ey lil' mama, cheer up!
You got your whole life to live, ey why you wanna tear up?
Don’t let them lil' boy come but do some when they try push up
Hey, hey

[Intro: The Dream & Big Sean]
Shit they got a picture of that shit?
Oh shit I'm finally famous
And I'm rolling with the motherfuckin top down
How can you blame us?
I wanna break you off like right now
I Do It, Boi, Do It
Multimillionaire This life is Top Floor y'know
B.I.....G. Sean Don Nigga, Finally Famous in this, Gettin' Money
Carrion, G.O.O.D
I wanna break you off like right now

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Hell yeah nigga high right now
That's the reason I said "hi" right now
Come have the time of your life right now
All you gotta do is close your eyes right now
This shit classic, they ask "where your outfit from?"
Plead the Saks Fifth, first class
Only culture games and practice
Oh you athletic? Shit, show me on the mattress
Cause it's already night time
And I feel like the right time
Twisting up my fingers
Like the young P-A-C, B-I-G but she just call me D-A-D
I do it

[Chorus: The Dream & Big Sean]
Oh shit I'm finally famous
And I'm rolling with the motherfuckin top down
How can you blame us?
I wanna break you off like right now
And I'mma need that penthouse on top of the world
That Detroit player on top of the world
Detroit players on top of your girl
It's been a hell of a night
What a beautiful life..
Fancy things...
Flashing lights, it's been a hell of a night
What a beautiful life..

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Hell yeah, nigga gone right now
That's why we should get gone right now
I'm trying to get you home right now
I bet I could turn you on right now
Really I can't call it
Stress turned me into a weed-head
And parties into an alcoholic
And money turned me into a workaholic
And money turned her into a twerkaholic
Yeah do it, do it, do it with no hands
Do it like you do it when you do it with your man
I could pull up in a Honda Civic, pulling bitches
Ain't about the cars, bout that nigga who is in it
Right here: and all I need is a minute
Start it up, guaranteed I'mma finish
In the nighttime, I feel like the right time
So here go the drink you've been waiting all life for
Make sure the muthafucking ice cold
My jewelry is ice-cold, stone is albino
Cause you're burning up, your outfit is dyno
Let's give em a light show

[Bridge: The Dream]
I ain't Paul McCartney or John Lennon
I ain't buying Beetles, I'm buying Benzes
They mad at you mamacita
Cause them bitches look like Bobby Bonilla

[Chorus: The Dream & Big Sean]
Oh shit I'm finally famous
And I'm rolling with the motherfuckin top down
How can you blame us?
I wanna break you off like right now
And I'mma need that penthouse on top of the world
That Detroit player on top of the world
Detroit players on top of your girl
It's been a hell of a night
What a beautiful life..
Fancy things...
Flashing lights, it's been a hell of a night
What a beautiful life..

[Intro: Pharrell Williams]
Yo! It's money time, nigga!
Yezzir, whoa yeah, hey

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
I'm tryna stuff em until I can't fit no more
I'm talking Donald Trump level
I'm trying to get these dreams off the ground
All aboard for the shuttle
All the hoes!
They screaming "Oh-oh!
Lil nigga go!
Go for the gold!"

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Okay, "B-I, B-I", bitch I do it to death
If I come with half, bet I leave with the rest
Okay, you might be cool getting 50%
I'm like "fuck you doing? I need Diddy percent!"
Got a million on line 1 and another mil' dialing in
Momma on line 4, telling me how much not to spend
'Ye on line 3 telling me how we 'bout to win
You on hold tryna get conferenced in
I ju- I just gotta have it
Imagine and make it happen, I prayed about it and grabbed it
My life is a fucking movie, the baddest bitches get casted
I'm in a race with myself to see who could get it the fastest
Sipping on shit older than me
The warmer the weather, the colder the drink
The colder the weather, the warmer the mink
I'm living life like a found a fucking check with no ink
I get it

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
I'm tryna stuff em until I can't fit no more
I'm talking Donald Trump level
I'm trying to get these dreams off the ground
All aboard the shuttle
All the hoes!
They screaming "Oh-oh!
Lil nigga go!
Go for the gold!"

[Post-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Hey! Get it, get it, nigga we can get it
Get it, get it, nigga you can get it
Get it, get it, nigga I can get it
Yea, yea, my nigga we can get it, let's go

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Whoa! The sky never seemed so low
Looking at her like "you never seemed so close"
I had a dream about a trillion in cash
It's time to make it happen!
I'm back to dreaming what you can't imagine
Talking cash, you gotta fake an accent
I've broke enough tree down that I could make a cabin
Look: I turn all my problems to ash
All my wants into haves and then divided it by half
Pass it on to my man, write my will out then
Pass it on to my fam and finally become a man
I had a dream I was greatest of all time
Greatest of all Bigs, greatest of all Seans
Sipping on shit older than me
The warmer the weather, the colder the drink
The colder the weather, the warmer the mink
I'm living life like a found a fucking check with no ink
I get it

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
I'm tryna stuff em until I can't fit no more
I'm talking Donald Trump level
I'm trying to get these dreams off the ground
All aboard the shuttle
All the hoes!
They screaming "Oh-oh!
Lil nigga go!
Go for the gold!"

[Post-Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Hey! Get it, get it, nigga we can get it
Get it, get it, nigga you can get it
Get it, get it, nigga I can get it
Yea, yea, my nigga we can get it, let's go

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Sometimes I dream bigger than I live
Sometimes I think better when I’m lit
So go on and light it
Roll it up, ignite it
One time for all my niggas that dreamed it than real life’d it
I swear I’ve been through everything in life but a coffin
They say sky’s the limit, how bitch?
I’m moonwalking
And my middle name Michael, ho
Success is my idol and being broke is my rival
But it’s cool because I got the title, ho
See I just want my fantasies in real life
You got everything tell me what it feel like
Motherfuck the radio if I can’t hear mine
They give the wrong people more airtime than airlines
Is you feeling me?
If not you feel my energy
See I know I’ma make it, but even if I don’t
Don’t feel bad cause honestly all these times that I had
Those will be the best memories

[Refrain: John Legend & Big Sean]
Let's reminisce on the good times and the bad
Be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
Reflect on everything we missed
Cause you know we'll never get it back
These will be the best memories
Woah woah, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, the memories
Cause in the end all you really have is memories
Woah woah, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, the memories

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Are you willing to give up what you love, for who you love
Or lose your girlfirend to groupie love
Everywhere I go I get a group of hugs
That's what happens when they need connections and you the plug
How many trends you gotta set til you considered great?
How many missed calls til you considered fake?
How many dreams til it's considered fate?
I’m eating in a world where I’m considered bait
A workaholic addicted to bills
People addicted to me cause they addicted to real
My best friend got addicted to pills
I can’t look at him in his eyes
You don’t know how that shit feels mentally
I ain't trying to rock no shirts that say in memory
I’m praying that he make it, wishing we could go back
Cause honestly all the times that we had
Those will be the best memories

[Refrain: John Legend & Big Sean]
Let's reminisce on the good times and the bad
Be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
Reflect on everything we missed
Cause you know we'll never get it back
These will be the best memories
Woah woah, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, the memories
Cause in the end all you really have is memories
Woah woah, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, the memories

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Sometimes reality checks are too big to be cashed
Mailed one when I heard Unique had died in that crash
Seems like yesterday I just seen her smile and laugh
I'm stressing over little shit
When I should be happy I can
They say my music beating, cause I follow my heart
I always have faith, light will swallow the dark
Hurtin' with my Mama looking at cribs we can't purchase
Houses bigger than the Palace
But she a queen, so she deserve it
So I'm focused, they try to throw me off track
But they just hurdles, I'm marathoning
To the money and you just running off in a circle
I'm huddled up with my team, in other words my inner circle
Fast forward a few years later
Now we the fucking winner's circle
Remember the first time I was rhyming for Kan
Almost as nervous as the first time I rhymed for my mom
Sold out the theater downtown, she said it was perfect
But I already dreamed it
So it felt like I rehearsed it
Much as my grandma took care of me since I was birthed
Sad I used to steal twenty dollar bill right out her purses
No I ain't perfect, tryna make a gift out of a curse
Life out of a hearse
And if I die first then I have the memories

[Refrain: John Legend & Big Sean]
Let's reminisce on the good times and the bad
Be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
Reflect on everything we missed
Cause you know we'll never get it back
Woah woah, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, the memories
Woah woah, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, the memories

Let's reminisce on the good times and the bad
Reflect on everything we missed
Cause you know we'll never get it back
Woah woah, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, the memories
Woah woah, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, the memories

[Verse 1: Tyler]
Who the heck invited Mr. (I Don't Wanna Cuss)
Who cries about his dad in a blog (Because he always fusses)
Boy you messing up and truthfully I've had enough
And screw rolling papers (I'm a rebel dog, I'm asking what?)
Full of crap like I ate that john
Come on kids (Screw that class and hit that thong)
Let's buy stuff and get those kids with dads and moms
With nice homes, 41k's (And those shiny lawns)
Those little punks gotta learn, we ain't takin no mess
What's up man? Do your best
Cause I don't have no home meal to come to
So if you do I'm throwing fingers out screaming (Umm, ooh?)
I got a bunch of these, a bunch of these
Not Dahm, if I was a Dahm I would be Humpty
Green hat the color of a leprechaun with leprosy
Really 'bout it 'bout it like I'm Master P (In sixty five)
It's really immaculate the way your girl be smacking (Me)
Surprised she hasn't did school stuff in the alley oop
Golf Wang hooligans messing up the school again
Showing you and yours that doing stuff is really cool again
I'm going harder than a midget jumping over me
Look at my hat, it's cool
Punches to the stomach where that other stuff's supposed to be
Forget this man, yeah!

[Hook]
It's the Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
Wolf Gang, triple six crew
(Turn me up, put your hands in the air, go Hodgy)

[Verse 2: Hodgy]
My love is gone for you Tommy, you can go figure
Now it's time for me to be a real, hey (Hold up)
This beat is real nice (Woo! Drop that, Sydney!)
So I'mma spit like I ain't never spit before
And I'mma walk through that.. door (Woo!)
And I'mma make all that.. dough
So is you messing with me? No
This that Wolf Gang, this that, this that Wolf Gang
Green hats and green gats, knocking everybody on their back
Mess around with me and I'm gon scratch your cat, uh!

[Hook]

[Outro: Hodgy]
They don't know us, they don't know us
They don't know where we from, they don't know nothing
I ain't joking

[Verse 1]
When the night falls
She heard the call of the street life
See the flicker of the street lights
Wanna know what it be like when it be right... there
Black lipstick tattoos of the peace sign
Plus the mark of the beast sign oh night please be kind
Baby girl has no... fears
Tight clothing
Blowing cigarette smoke in slow motion
All full of love potion but its frozen
Thinks the world´s so insincere
Now she dancing with strangers
She don´t know they name no
The city has claimed her but she doesn´t care

[Hook: Kenna] (x2)
What you want want
What you want want
Come and get it get it
What you want want
What you want want want

[Verse 2]
When the night falls
She had to call of the bright life
See the shine in the spotlights
Wanna know what that like when it be right... there
White liar put her name in their headlines
Naked pictures on her website
Just a rabbit in the headlights
Baby girl don´t you be ... scared
Red carpet on the arms of an artist
Is starlit on the star-less paparazzi target
Thinks being normal´s just so unfair
She knows that its dangerous she wants to be famous
But she´s not ashamed ´cause it ain´t nothing there

[Hook: Kenna] (x2)

When the day comes
And they looking far away from where they came from
See the night has betrayed them told em it would stay young
Told them they would stay young
Now they see the sun
The night´s on the run right before the rise
Black mascara´s running from their eyes
But big girls don´t cry
It´ll be alright
It´ll be tonight (tonight)
They´ll cut back on the lies

[Hook: Kenna] (x2)

[Intro]
Right now, sucker
Sour Hour
DJ Shef, Shef
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh, 

[?], what up?
East End Empire all day, you know
Uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1]
Let me let you smoke a blunt of my mind
See, I'm one of a kind
There's a brain behind all these different wonderful rhymes
And peoples livin' in the past 'cause they runnin' from time (Uh)
Seems like so long since Big Punisher died
Hope he see me when I'm lookin' up from under the sky (Yup)
I'ma tell you how it is 'cause I got nothin' to hide
And Soul Theory makes the beats that'll bump in the ride (Uh-huh)
This criminal lifestyle that I'm jumpin' inside
A mastermind, superb with both sides of his brain
Roll me up into a Swisher, start flyin' away
But ash my soul, rub the L on the side of the tray
'Cause it's hard lookin' up, like the sky when it rains (Uh-huh)
Smokin' strains that levitate me like David Blaine
I'm a player and you hatin' on my game
Say my name, 'cause this here's my destiny, child
Now all this stress is off of my chest, I can rest for a while

[Chorus]
Just roll up (Roll up), roll up (Roll up), roll up (Roll up)
Let me let you smoke a blunt of my mind
All you haters relax
Sit back, sit back, sit back, and got you feelin' so fine
With a blunt of my, blunt of my, got you feelin' so high
Got me feelin' so, feelin' so, with this blunt of my mind

[Verse 2]
And I shall not (Uh-huh), hold thy tongue
So I'ma speak 'til I fold my gums
I was told to run (Run), 'cause every day is a colder one
I wake up not knowin' if I'm old or young
I can't (Can't), find my place so I lay upon these beats (Beats)
Coverin' my pain with layers of melodic sheets (Uh-huh)
Mother Earth's a bitch, so when kingdom come
We gon' bring 'em some 'til thy will be done
And still to come is when I'm finally driven to insanity
By my family, who never seemed to be a fan of me
My knees are shakin', see, I'm not able to stand
'Cause they label a man by his paper in hand
Sittin' in a dark alley with some paper and pens
Writin', just thinkin' when this day's gon' end
What can you say to a man who can't look at himself
When the image in the mirror keeps on yellin' for help? (Uh-huh)

[Chorus]
Just roll up (Roll up), roll up (Roll up), roll up (Roll up)
Let me let you smoke a blunt of my mind
All you haters relax
Sit back, sit back, sit back, and got you feelin' so fine
With a blunt of my, blunt of my, got you feelin' so high
Got me feelin' so, feelin' so (Uh), with this blunt of my mind (Yeah, I'm)

[Verse 2]
Hip-hop's child, you feel me do the touchin'
Spittin' got me smitten, no excuses for the lovin' (Uh)
I'm tryna get it written but I'm comin' up with nothin'
A couple words in each line filled with somethin', somethin', somethings (Uh-huh)
And to me, hip-hop ain't got a criminal past
It's just explosions of sounds as these syllables clash
Brain on critical mass (Yup), fuck political trash (Yup)
These politicians speakin', but it's comin' out they ass
Talkin' bout "School is cool" and "Drugs is for thugs"
Tryna push me down a path, but I shall not budge
'Cause I've been thinkin' and I think I have a hunch
Who hand the mic to get enough
While me and music makin' love
And my community ain't all about who I choose to be
This life and what it do to me, the ruined opportunities
This figurative language that I'm speakin' so fluently
Look back like a photo album, seein' who I used to be (Chyeah)
Playin' piano and I'm strummin' guitar
Can't buy myself a spaceship so I'm runnin' to Mars
Stare at death in the face, like I'm under a car (Uh-huh)
It ain't everybody hatin', but enough of you are

[Chorus]
Just roll up (Roll up), roll up (Roll up), roll up (Roll up)
Let me let you smoke a blunt of my mind
All you haters relax
Sit back, sit back, sit back, and got you feelin' so fine
With a blunt of my, blunt of my, got you feelin' so high
Got me feelin' so, feelin' so, with this blunt of my mind

See me downtown, 'Rari (Skrrt), I didn't mean to shit on you
Excuse me, sorry, verse so slick, make my video marvelous
Polo to the floor, Ralph'd down like Carlton
Try the CEO, they gon' put you on a carton (Carton)
I didn't mean no harm, but my diamonds are dumb (Bling, bling)
Plenty of rocks on my arm (Brr, brr)
Me and Rocko the Don, East Atlanta the Slum
Where I'm from, we got a gun, in the club havin' fun (It's Gucci)
And after it's done, no more coaches to call it (Yeah)
After party, bachelor party, they shoulda called it (It's Gucci)

[Chorus: Rocko & Gucci Mane]
I love things about her (But I don't love her, huh)

Good head on her shoulders, I love the way she use it
Ayy, I like the way she fuck me, love the way she suck me (Yeah)
Love how every time we play, she catch it like rugby
I love she know what's up with me (Sup?), she love me 'cause I'm gudda (Gudda)

Still super cool, though, yeah, she my lil' buddy (My buddy)

[Verse 3: Webbie]
I love how she be swallowin' my nut, then she be throwin' me up
Love how she fuck, but still, I hate when she be blowin' me up
All the busters'll sweat her, only ballers can get her
She a flipper, I love how she do whatever I tell her
Yeah, I like her a lot, but still, I don't love her at all
I hate pussy-ass niggas, and I'm in love with the mall (Mall)
I got a crush on white diamonds and I got a thing for that kush
That Sour Diesel my favorite, you better watch how you look (Yeah)
Quick to take your lil' diva, then treat that ho like a slut
She was suckin' on Gucci, I had my dick in her butt
You know I'm bad bitch crazy, one-eighty-seven's my favorite
Infatuated with money, free Boosie-Boo, the streets waiting

[Chorus: Rocko & Gucci Mane]
I love things about her (But I don't love her, huh)
I love the way she treat me (But I don't love her, no)

I love the way she suck me (Still don't love her, ayy, no)

[Verse 1 - Cee Lo]
I will build a bridge
Over the troubled water for you
The one that was here
Was weak and weary
Time had worn it down
Started little by little
With your feet right in the middle
We laugh about it later
But it's time for it now
Soon as all the work is done
Both hands in harmony
Sit and talk and share the sun
I know that you can feel it
But it's gonna take a minute

[Hook]
It's gonna get a little easier
Oh, it's gonna get a little easier
A little easier for you to understand

[Verse 2 - Cee Lo]
I want to build the bridges
So that when the elder spirit
It reminds us of that spirit
That makes us all the same
Don't give up on your children
Because of human nature
We've got virtue, we've got vices
What you've done is not in vain
It don't matter how long it's been
Turn back the music on
I want to dance with my father again
I know that you can feel it
But it's gonna take a minute

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Cee Lo]
I want to build a bridge
Between every sister and brother
Father and mother, friend and lover
Black, white and other love one another
I dare you to just do it
It's the only way to prove it
If I promise to take the first step
Will you take the other?
Don't you want to be certain?
Don't you want to know you're free?
You can come together over me
I know that you can feel it
But it's gonna take a minute

[Hook]

You know we've got to find a way
To bring some loving here today, oh (Oh)

[Chorus]
Picket lines (Sister) and picket signs (Sister)
Don't punish me (Sister) with brutality (Sister)

Everybody thinks we're wrong

Simply 'cause our hair is long?
Oh, you know we've got to find a way
To bring some understanding here today, oh-oh

Da-boo-doo, boo-boo-boo-doo
Da-boo-boo-doo, boo-boo-boo

[Verse 1]
I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

[Pre-Chorus]
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

[Verse 2]
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

[Pre-Chorus]
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

[Bridge]
Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

[Breakdown]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

[Chorus]
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

[Intro]
Ay, I just got a idea
You know
Thinking of some things we could do, spice things up
For sure

[Verse 1]
If I snuck up in your bedroom, touch you while you sleep
Would you act surprised as if you didn't know it's me?
I came to steal your heart, girl, don't call the police
I only want a part, girl, really just a piece
If you show me the money, then I'm gon' show you the beast
If you give me your honey, girl, I promise I'll be sweet
Then, I'm gon' sneak out the back, so nobody will notice me
Then we can run it back girl, it's your turn to go on me, we can

[Chorus]
We can try some role play, you can do what I say
I can do what you say, you can have it your way
We can try some role play, I can do what you say
You can do what I say, I can have it my way
We can try some role play, you can do what I say
I can do what you say, you can have it your way
We can try some role play, I can do what you say
You can do what I say, I can have it my way

[Verse 2]
The room is spinning ridiculous, my body freezing cold
I can't even remember what I did the night before
I don't know where I am, girl, but I gotta go
I can't feel my legs, somebody help
If you come in and rescue me, I don't know what to do
I say I need a remedy, you say the cure is you
Then you tell me relax and get ready for surgery
Baby, fix me fast, you know it's an emergency

[Chorus]
We can try some role play, you can do what I say
I can do what you say, you can have it your way
We can try some role play, I can do what you say
You can do what I say, I can have it my way
We can try some role play, you can do what I say
I can do what you say, you can have it your way
We can try some role play, I can do what you say
You can do what I say, I can have it my way

[Bridge]
You got your picture in your mind, let me see
Now that we're together, girl
Don't be shy, now, it's alright, you'll start to see
Show me your direction, girl
You got your picture in your mind, let me see
Now that we're together, girl
Don't be shy, now, it's alright, you'll start to see
Show me your direction, girl

[Chorus]
We can try some role play, you can do what I say
I can do what you say, you can have it your way
We can try some role play, I can do what you say
You can do what I say, I can have it my way
We can try some role play, you can do what I say
I can do what you say, you can have it your way
We can try some role play, I can do what you say
You can do what I say, I can have it my way

[Outro]
Role play, role play, you can have it your way
Role play, role play, I can have it my way
Role play, role play, I can have it my way
Role play, role play, you can have it your way
Role play, babe
Role play, babe

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Bank accounts, big cars
Living good like a movie star
My mama house ain’t in the hood no more
I moved her out to San Lu' Obispo
But it's a trip, though, 'cause I'm a 20 Crip though
I gotta lay low, my homies wanna do low
I got two strikes and I'm gonna get my third
These niggas snitching on me, they think I'm selling birds
So when I'm in the streets, I'm quick on my feet
See, talk is cheap so I stay quick on my heat
You niggas bad? Well, Dogg is badder
"Rat-a-tatta!", make you niggas scatter
I one shotta, your boy want me now
Went to the station, that nigga straight point me out (Snitch)
So I'ma lay away and spray away and spray away
'Cause at this time I think it's best to just stay away

[Chorus: Mr. Porter]
They say I am a fool
'Cause I like to do my thing my own way (My own way)
I gotta couple strikes against me
One more and I'm on my way (I'm on my way)
I ain’t got time to hang around the hood like I used to do
I gotta get my bread, keep my head
It's either go to jail or get this money instead

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Separate, elevate
Concentrate, dominate, and innovate
Try to be, fly as me
And every other homie tell a lie to me
I need a deal, I need some stones
I need some beats, Dogg, I need a loan
Help me out, throw me some cash
If I got it, you got it and you ain’t got to ask
But on the real - or is it lately?
A lot of homies done tried to implicate me
They say I changed; is it the fame?
If I throw it to you, then charge it to the game
Money fold: overload
In the hood, another episode
Man, I'm getting old, the game cold
Yeah, I'm from the dub, but that ain’t how I roll

[Chorus: Mr. Porter]
They say I am a fool
'Cause I like to do my thing my own way (My own way)
I gotta couple strikes against me
One more and I'm on my way (I'm on my way)
I ain’t got time to hang around the hood like I used to do
I gotta get my bread, keep my head
It's either go to jail or get this money instead

[Intro]
My mind is telling me no
But my body, my body's telling me yes
Baby, I don't want to hurt nobody
But there is something that I must confess to you (woo)

[Chorus]
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
With a little bump and grind
I don't see nothing wrong, baby, hey
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
I don't see nothing wrong, hey, woah, let me hear you

[Verse 1]
See I know just what you want
And I know just what you need, girl
So baby, bring your body to me (bring your body here)
I'm not fooling around with you, huh
Baby, my love is true (with you)
With you is where I want to be

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl you need someone
Someone like me, yeah
To satisfy your every need

[Chorus]
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
I don't see nothing wrong, baby, baby, I don't see, woo
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
I don't see nothing wrong, baby, hey, huh

[Verse 2]
You say he's not treating you right
Then, lady, spend the night
I'll love you like you need to be love
Girl, won't you try some of me
No need to look no more
Because I've opened up my doors
You'll never feel another love you see
You'll never wanna another love
You'll never find another me

[Pre-Chorus]
You need someone, someone like me, yeah
To make love to you, baby, constantly

[Chorus]
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
Hey, nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
I don't see nothing wrong, oh, woah
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
I don't see nothing wrong, baby, baby, alright

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
You big cat
You big pussy
I got big dough, we sell big kushy
You fat fucker
You fucking moulie
You big piece of shit
You tried to trick the Gucci
I fucked your girl (I fucked her)
While you was gone (I did it)
Then fucked your girl (damn)
While you was home (again)
She's home alone
She call my phone
She gave me dome
Won't leave me lone
I know all ya business, and all ya spots
Know how you move, let's fire some shots
You know all my business, and all my spots
You know how I move
Lets fire some shots
I came to this fat fuck chained up
Ranged up gangbang nigga I was flamed up
Big Broke Records
Bankrupt Records
If I wasn't trappin' I would be special
Gucci like to shoot
Gucci like to murk
Cat snitched got 14 months damn (true)
Mella yes man (true)
Sucking Cat's dick (true)
Big Cat Ms. Davenport

Now ya'll mad that ya'll broke and I'm rich
And ya'll ain't worth 3 cents
Just like shawty shoot the studio up
Beyoch!

[Verse 1]
Oh, I wish I had a boyfriend
I wish I had a loving man in my life
I wish I had a father
Maybe then I would’ve turned out right
But now I’m just crazy, and totally mad
Yeah I’m just crazy, fucked up in the head
And maybe if I really tried with all of my heart
Then I could make a brand new start in love with you
Oh, I wish I had a suntan
I wish I had a pizza and a bottle of wine
I wish I had a beach house
Then we could make a big fire every night
But now I’m just crazy, and totally mad
Yeah I’m just crazy, fucked up in the head
And if I really tried with all of my heart
Then I could make a brand new start in love with you, in love with you

[Verse 2]
Listen to my mouth, nigga I meant it
Don’t fuck with me unless you want your swag pregnant
A nigga bad grammar, I run on sentence
I am just a rapper, so I don’t need practice
I am just different, I eat/sleep genius
Forever I love Atlanta, I stunt these Filas
Swag celibate, I don’t fuck with these bitches
Smoke these niggas, turn ‘em all swishers
Can’t make up my mind I gotta fuck both sisters
And my flow is retarded, I spit autism
Got that shit to make ya bounce like Tigger
‘Cause I am more childish than “good job” stickers
Your girl’s in the room so I don’t have any jeans on
We are at war, so my wallet is the Green Zone
We can do this shit, any time, anywhere
And you know you aren’t me and I know it isn’t fair
Yeah, these niggas apple trees, they need to grow a pair
I balled in the store, but nigga, I got hair
And as soon I got here, the girls act different
But I don’t have to act, I’ve been different for a minute, mothafucker

[Verse 1: Andy Samberg]
After the club is the after party
After the party is the hotel lobby
After that, you know it's Dom and Cris
And after that, I say, 'Excuse me, miss'
And after that, we goin' back to the room
And after that, she's gonna leave real soon
And after that, I crack one more beer
And after that, I just stare in the mirror
And after that, I start freakin' out
What the hell am I doing with my life?
Call up my mom and get my cry on
I order room service, get my apple pie on
And after that, I just walk the streets
A homeless dude throws up on my feet
And I see just how pointless life is
Full-on existential crisis
Tear off my clothes and scream at the sky
Fall to my knees and ask God "Why?"

[Chorus: Santigold]
This nightlife is killing me
I think I'm losing my mind
I yearn to fly, yet I sink
Cristal and tears is my drink

[Verse 2: Andy Samberg]
After that, I drive into the hills
And trade my car for a bottle of pills
And after that, I'm on a vision quest
Put my mind, body, and soul to the test
And after that, I meet my totem spirit
It's a rattlesnake, so I have to kill it
Then I drink all his blood and steal his powers
And slither around in the dirt for hours
And after that I start jerking off
Up on a mountain, jerking off
Down by the river, jerking off
And that's when I have my epiphany
You can't spend your whole life jerking off
And after that, I'm going back to the city

[Chorus: Santigold]
This nightlife is killing me
No more jerking off
Fate only knows what's in store
Crystalline tears for me no more

[Verse 3: Andy Samberg]
And after that, I clean up my life
Join AA to make it right
And after that, I get my thirty day chip
And after that, I go celibate
And after that, I'm a whole new man
Brew kombucha in my hybrid van
I give my life to meditation
Then sleep with a whore at a Greyhound station
And after that, I have a full relapse
Then lose my hand in a game of craps (Aaah!)
And after that, everyone calls me Claw
And after that, I work for Tim McGraw (Hey!)
And after that, I pass out in a sewer
Meet a giant fish, fuck his brains out
And after, that I'm filled with shame
No one but myself to blame
Nothing in my heart but pain
And next week we're gonna do it again!

[Chorus: Santigold]
This nightlife's got it's hooks in me
I'm back to jerking off
I tried but could not break free
Crystalline tears return to me

[Bridge: Santigold]
Started in the club, then he moved to the Hills
Then he freaked out and drank snake blood
Got himself clean, now back in the club
And that's what happened in this song
Crystalline tears, this playboy life's too much for me

[Outro: Andy Samberg]
After the club is the after party
After the party is the hotel lobby
Stuck in a cycle I just can't win
And after that, it all happens again

[Intro]
(Noise)
Uh, check it, uh

[Verse 1]
I've been looking for this groove
You have it, I need it
I can show you how to move
To stay with your feet up (Uh)

[Bridge]
Baby girl we'll dance

Baby girl we'll dance
Until the sun kidnaps the night

Boogie 'till the sky is blue
The moon is our enemy
Slide until you burn your shoes
Our feet fly so freely, hoo-hoo-hoo

[Bridge]
Baby girl we'll dance
Until the moon aborts the sky
Baby girl we'll dance
Until the sun kidnaps the night

[Chorus]
Baby girl you hold it
Love the way you're moving

Boogie 'till the morning
Boogie 'till next evening

[Verse 3]
Got ya girl, just do it like me
Baby girl do it like me
Don't think about, just move your feet
Baby girl move your feet
Rock it girl, just do it like me
Baby girl do it like me
Don't think about it, just move your feet
Baby girl move your feet

[Chorus]
Baby girl you hold it
Love the way you're moving
I just wanna see you freak
Boogie 'till the morning
Boogie 'till next evening
Baby I will set you free (Hoo-hoo)

Ayy, man
I'm, I'm walkin' on South Beach the other day, right?
You know, the Memorial Day weekend shit thing
Yeah, so they got a nigga come up to me with a video camera, right?
And you know motherfuckers come up to me with cameras every day, so I don't be trippin'
All day, every day, you know what I mean?
So, but guess what this nigga asked me?
"Yo, can I battle you on camera?"
I was like, "Dawg, how much we gon' make for this?"
You, you really think, yo
Yo, for all you niggas thinkin' y'all can see me
And think it's really a game 'cause I'm from the South or I don't really be boastin' and braggin' 'bout that flowin' shit
Dawg, I got this shit, dawg
You niggas think you could fuck with me?

[Chorus: Dwele]
I am in love with the lights, the love, the rights, the wrongs
They told me that it wouldn't be night for long!
The life, the love, the rights, the wrong
They told me that it wouldn't be night for long!

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
And I'm in love with the lights, the love
Celebrity hoes, Hollywood parties that never get old
Table full of new hoes, champagne nuvo
My mind is on Venus, but my neck is on Pluto
I need a girl that look badder than my girlfriend
You know the ones that look badder than their girlfriends
Paparazzi try to pop Big since I'm in Cali
But I just hide my face doing a Errol Flynns
Hoody over my head, Jedi, Anakin
Looking like a BBC Louis V mannequin
She ain't got no man in em
She got no companion, she's Jenifer Aniston
I'm trying to hit her, and her friend
And again, and again
Pass it to my mans and them
Fucking all the baddest bitches in cities we're landing in!

[Pre-Chorus: Dwele]
What happens when it all falls
And the success is all gone
And is all gone?
But for now I'm a celebrity!
For now I'm a celebrity!

[Chorus: Dwele]
I am in love with the lights, the love, the rights, the wrongs
They told me that it wouldn't be night for long!
The life, the love, the rights, the wrong
They told me that it wouldn't be night for long!

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I'm in love with the money..
They say that it's the root of all evil
At least that's what the pastor tried to teach us
But he will pass around that collection plate
Til it's heavyweight as soon as his speech through
Then hop in that Benz coupe
Shit, I'm trying to get Benz too!
But how is it the root of all evil?
If it could take my whole family out to Rio?
No more repo
A depo, just speed boats
Jewelry all gold call me C3PO
Smoke so much, I gotta see 3PO
Cause I'm worldwide tour with me and my nigga Zeno
Most comfortable behind the mics like T.O
So I hate to lose my Mike like Tito

[Pre-Chorus: Dwele]
What happens when it all falls
And the success is all gone
And is all gone?
But for now I'm a celebrity!
For now I'm a celebrity!

[Chorus: Dwele]
Cause I'm in love with the lights, the love, the rights, the wrongs
They told me that it wouldn't be night for long!
The life, the love, the rights, the wrong
They told me that it wouldn't be night for long!

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
I do it for, everything in life for love and meaning
I hope they never try to tell me I'm leaving
Getting everything I want, then I've got my mom next
LA Reid sign checks right after the contract
I always have a crazy flow pockets was on radio
Active cause I guess I was active on a radio
Way back in high school, yeah nigga CT
Where I met my nigga Tone, Pat Piff, and CT
Came out of the slump nigga way before T3
Giving hoes the run around, we just call them track meets
It's funny now when I look back
Cause them times gave me the inspiration that the track needs

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Dealin' with everybody's opinion, tryna do me
Only down one, I'm in the final, shootin' threes
Like I don't give a fuck, music, we fuck and switch the position up
We love the things that keep on bringin' out the kids in us
Been workin' all my life to do some different stuff
And people have the nerve to say I'm young and haven't lived enough
I'm on the road, my girl so sad I'm gone
It's hard when I can't even find the time to call my mom
And she thinks I'm goin' Hollywood, I guess she probably should
It seems like people see the bad and don't acknowledge good
I feel the shade, but I can see the sun, I'm cool
I've got the time, but feel the need to run, a fool
Is what I've become, young and I'm dumb
Been spendin' cake to get some bump in the trunk
Drums with a pump
Like some Reeboks, see me from the treetops
They worry, but they need not, heatin' like a teapot
Now I think I'm cool 'cause I got a pair of shoes
And mo' dough, a jacket with a Polo logo
My cup always filled with Henny, so no Fo' Loko
But they should know, so
I could go slow
You see that I'm smooth now
Used to ignore me, they study what I do now
With some help from Kweli, and it's Like on the Beat
It's cool to say that my cypher complete

[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]
Word
I'm so sick with the verbs I use, the words that heal us
They love how we kill it on stage, man, Murder theaters
No wonder they call it a bunk, I sleep in a coffin
Dead tired, exhausted from how often I be tourin'
So gangsta, like the occupation of Made Men
Creatin' chaos, my operation is Mayhem
The movie never stopped, the frame change over
We added Mac to the wolfpack, Hangover
That Hen is not a friend, I'm on that Lagavulin
Whatever substance, I abuse it like a grown man
You're not a kid no more, no one to hold your hand
And Four Loko make your shoulder lean like a Dro fan
Go ham, like Abraham readin' all the Psalms
Oh yeah, and don't forget to call your moms
Same thing I told Bow Wow last year
Take care of the fam, 'cause it's all we really have here

[Intro: DJ Raj Smoove]
Greatest DJ in the world
Best Rapper Alive
Young Money Volume 1!
LilWeezyAna!
Raj Smoove
Yo Taz, I see you
The greatest DJ in the world

[Verse 1]
OK, I spit that, get back
I'm intact, in fact, the author's authentic
OK, I spit that, get back
I'm intact, in fact, the author— (Ooh, boy!)
Oil, slick like Syntec, inject
Even the paralyzed feel my impact, as I...
Skim back over my words that's on the page
I'm lyin', I don't write, I get high and ignite
I got a serious mental plan and dental plan
And you don't want to bring the giant out of the gentle-man
Gee, golly, gigabytes, and a gorilla's hand
To the side of a nigga face like I don't give a damn
Even if he's with his mans and thems
I put his plans and limbs all over his pants and Timbs
And I wasn't fortunate to grow up like The Sims
But instead I blew up before I grew up, haha!
I spend eight and put two up
'Cause you never know when I have to do what
Do when? Do who? Do you and you two
And you too, woohoo, haha!
Now, I'm cuckoo like birds with my words
I'm poopoo, meaning I'm the shit on you turds
Yes, and I get on your nerves
Yes, and I get on your nerves
And yes; and I get on your nerves
And sit on your mind like piss on the curb
Bitch-bitch! Disturb me? While I'm working-ing?
You are just another Earthling
Be in the game, shit I must be first-string
I like my tucks baggy and my turf clean-ean, ah!
Check my pattern/scheme
I probably have on rocks from the Moon, and Saturn's ring-ring
Uh, whose badder, give 'em a ladder
Tell them climb on up here and watch me get at her
The badder part about it is, these niggas hate
But you won't even get a bar on my mixtape
I'm probably on a boat feedin' a bitch grapes and crepes
By the way, that's French pancakes
Je parlons Francais trés bién
Garçon adore chaude lesbiennes
Pardon my French, pardon the stench
But I smoke that Grinch 'til my eyes squinch
I meant "squint," I'm so bent like a dent
But bitch, I'm still no Clark Kent

[Hook]
And my Momma used to tell me
Not to let nobody fuck with me
It stuck with me
I keep it real to the world, publicly
Unbelievable
I said my Momma used to tell me
Not to let nobody fuck with me
It stuck with me
I keep it real to the world, publicly
Unbelievable

[Outro]
Bitches say they love you but they hate you
And they say that it's all a part of our animal nature
Son, just watch your damn behavior
'Cause every animal has a tamer
I come from where the gangstas came from
Go down like the rain that the drain sucks
Goddamn, the game sucks
Thank God I'm famous
Thank God I'm famous

[Intro]
Uh
Aw yeah, aw yeah
Call up on drank and let's
Let's call up and, uh

[Interlude]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
I don't really give a fuck and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older, somebody should've told you
I'm on one (Ayy), fuck it, I'm on one (Yeah)
I said I'm on one, fuck it, I'm on one, a strong one
Two white cups and I got that drink
It could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got, and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I'm on one, fuck it, I'm on one
Aw yeah, aw yeah
You know what I'm
Oh yes, oh yeah
Oh yes, oh yeah
Uh, oh yes, oh yeah
Yeah, uh

[Verse 1]
You know what I'm sipping, I'll teach you how to mix it
But you're the only one 'cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches, they might catch me slipping
So you're the only one, 'cause I don't trust these bitches
They might, they might catch me slipping and put in something different
So you're the only one, 'cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches, they might catch me slipping
So you're the only one

[Chorus]
Oh-woah, trust issues
Oh-woah, trust issues
Oh-woah, trust issues
Oh-woah, woah, woah, woah

[Interlude]
Yeah, aw yeah, aw yeah
Let's call up on drank and let's all get wasted
On drank and let's all get faded, yeah, uh

[Verse 2]
Drizzy Drake, check me out
Coming live from the motherfuckin' North Side
Kick game, run game, run it real good
But never ever have my bitches sitting courtside
Same nigga that you knew way back when
You acting like it's somebody you don't know
Tell me, how the fuck we 'posed to stay friends
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show?
I could tell, I could tell, I could tell
Certain people don't like me no more
New shit don't excite me no more
Guess that they don't really make 'em like me no more, uh
You can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself
'Cause if y'all what I created then I hate myself
But still, let them girls in and tell 'em all
Leave them cell phones on the table where we see them
I'm all day with it, man, AM to the PM
Niggas hating, I just wish that they would say it when they see him, oh

[Bridge]
That's that shit that drives me crazy
And it's all that I've been getting lately
And it's probably why I'm scared to put the time in
Women want to fuck like they're me and I'm them
Looking for some things and I think that I can find 'em in you, in you

[Chorus]
Oh-woah, trust issues
Oh-woah, trust issues
Oh-woah, trust issues
Oh-woah, woah, woah, woah

[Outro]
Yeah, aw yeah, aw yeah
Let's call up on drank and let's all get wasted
On drank and let's all get faded, yeah
Aw yeah, aw yeah
Call up on drank and let's
Let's call up on, uh

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Travie McCoy]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no—
Oh—ote
Make me your radio (Yeah, ha ha)
And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up a little bit)
This melody was meant for you (Right there)
Just sing along to my stereo (Gym Class Heroes, baby!)

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I ask you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like yikky-yeah check it, Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to, used to, used to, used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

[Pre-Chorus 1: Travie McCoy]
If I could only find a note to make you understand
I’d sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Just keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Travie McCoy]
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no— (Yeah)
Oh—ote (Yeah, yeah, come on)
Make me your radio (Uh-uh)
And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up)
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine & Travie McCoy]
Oh, oh oh-oh, oh
Oh oh-oh (To my stereo)
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Just sing along to my stereo
Let's go!

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
If I was an old-school, fifty-pound boombox (Remember them?)
Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk?
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops? (Turn it up)
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop (Peace)
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know, we come and go like on the interstate (Never know)

[Pre-Chorus 2: Travie McCoy]
I think I finally found a note to make you understand
If you could hit it, sing along and take me by the hand
Just keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
You know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Travie McCoy]
My heart's a stereo (Yeah)
It beats for you, so listen close (Listen)
Hear my thoughts in every no—
Oh—ote (Oh, oh)
Make me your radio (Come on)
And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up)
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo (Sing along like)

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine & Travie McCoy]
Oh, oh oh-oh, oh (Yeah)
Oh oh-oh (To my stereo)
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Just sing along to my stereo

[Bridge: Adam Levine & Travie McCoy]
I only pray you never leave me behind (Never leave me)
Because good music can be so hard to find (So hard to find)
I take your hand and hold it closer to mine (Yeah)
Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind (Yeah, yeah, come on)

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
My heart's a stereo (Yeah)
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no—
Oh—ote (Oh, oh, oh)
Make me your radio (Ah-huh)
And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up)
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

[Outro: Adam Levine & Travie McCoy]
Oh, oh oh-oh, oh (Haha)
Yeah, yeah, ye—eh—eh
Oh oh oh-oh (To my stereo) (Let's go)
Yeah, yeah, ye—eh—eh
Oh, oh-oh (It's your boy, Travie)
Yeah, yeah, ye—eh—eh
(Gym Class Heroes, baby) Just sing along to my stereo
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Ay, ay
I'm from a big city, trying to make a living
Come to my hood, everybody get it
And for that paper all the wrong things sound right
Where I'm from they push 100 keys and it sound like
Where I'm from they push 100 keys and it sound like
Young niggas getting money, young niggas getting money
Just a bittersweet symphony

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I play the keys, handle dope, Barry Manilow
The game a bitch, but at times she sweet like cantaloupe
Hit the road, key of coke in the manifold
Triple beam dreams with a trunk full of scattered clothes
Japanese denim, down south numbers
Hit it once, trust it'll make a fat fiend stumble
Do the speed limit, Argo shoes
Call 'em penny loafers, they a pretty penny too
I'm tippin' strippers but I call it penny pinchin'
She talkin' shit but I can get her titties lifted
My new crib got its own city limit
Motherfucker got his own city in it
Blue marble on the floor, wet as salt water
Underboss I'll just play the holes like a golf course

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I'm from a big city, trying to make a living
Come to my hood, everybody get it
And for that paper all the wrong things sound right
Where I'm from they push 100 keys and it sound like
Where I'm from they push 100 keys and it sound like
Young niggas getting money, young niggas getting money
Just a bittersweet symphony

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
One hundred keys, one hundred please
My gesundheit could make a whole city sneeze
Walked the mud jungle where they grinded out the leaves
So they swarm to my honey comb, hideout for the bees
You know what this sound like, money counters' sound bites
Machine gun fire, name ringin' through the town like
Church bells ringin', know what he was found like?
Colombian necktie over hospital gown white
She live on her knees, I live in a condo in the trees
The air's a little thinner that I breathe
The Iron Man Audi, let the top striptease
My life's in slow motion, but the watch screamin' freeze
Ugh, young nigga gettin' money
The feds' dragnet couldn't take nothin' from me
The decoy car is a crash test dummy
What follows is a hundred of 'em, wrapped like a mummy

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I'm from a big city, trying to make a living
Come to my hood, everybody get it
And for that paper all the wrong things sound right
Where I'm from they push 100 keys and it sound like
Where I'm from they push 100 keys and it sound like
Young niggas getting money, young niggas getting money
Just a bittersweet symphony

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
B.I., boi
And they gon' risk a hundred lives
So they could rock a hundred whites
Baguettes lookin' like a hundred lights
Man when Blade died my city cried a hundred nights
Yeah I got a main girl, but I done hit a hundred tight
Every wrong I do I'm steady tryna do a hundred rights
Got her for cheap, compare the price
My nigga keep that low key, Barry White
And don't worry 'bout the info
From where they rob Pintos and could afford Enzos
Cause everybody knows keys open doors, but bricks open windows
Counting a hundred hundreds, more by more
Built this from the tile up, floor by floor
Talk shit, I'll send 'em door by door
Made for the Snow White like 4 by 4s

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I'm from a big city, trying to make a living
Come to my hood, everybody get it
And for that paper all the wrong things sound right
Where I'm from they push 100 keys and it sound like
Where I'm from they push 100 keys and it sound like
Young niggas getting money, young niggas getting money
Just a bittersweet symphony

[Verse 1]
My mama told me when I was hatched
Act like a superstar
Save your allowance, buy a bubble dress
And someday you will go far
Now on red carpets, well, I'm hard to miss
The press follows everywhere I go
I'll poke your eye out with a dress like this
Back off and enjoy the show!

[Chorus]
I'm sure my critics will say it's a grotesque display
Well, they can bite me, baby—I perform this way!
I might be wearing Swiss cheese or may be covered with bees
It doesn't mean I'm crazy—I perform this way!

[Bridge]
Ooh, my little monsters pay
Lots ’cause I perform this way
Baby, I perform this way
Ooh, don't worry, I'm okay
Hey, I just perform this way
I'm not crazy—I perform this way
I'll be a troll or evil queen
I'll be a human jelly bean
'Cause every day is Halloween
For me...

[Verse 2]
I'm so completely original
My new look is all the rage
I'll wrap my small intestines 'round my neck
And set fire to myself on stage
I'll wear a porcupine on my head
On a W-H-I-M (Hey! Hey! Hey!)
And for no reason now I'll sing in French
Excusez-moi, qui a pété? (Express yourself!)

[Chorus]
Got my straight jacket today, it's made of gold lamé
No, not because I'm crazy—I perform this way!
I strap prime rib to my feet, cover myself with raw meat
I'll bet you've never seen a skirt steak worn this way!

[Verse 3]
Don't be offended when you see
My latest pop monstrosity
I'm strange, weird, shocking, odd, bizarre
I'm Frankenstein! I'm Avatar!
There's nothing too embarrassing
I'll honestly do anything
But wear white after Labor Day
'Cause baby, I perform this way!

[Chorus]
Hope you won't think it's cliché if I go nude today
Don't call the cops now, baby—I perform this way
No reason I should regret all the attention I get
I'm not completely crazy—I perform this way, yeah

I perform this way-hey, I perform this way-hey
I'm always deviating from the norm this way-hey
I perform this way-hey, I perform this way-hey
I'm really not insane—I just perform this way-hey

[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
Busy, the A and R
Lupe, Chi town, nigga
Yeah, FnF up

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Busy let's see what this inspire
From begin to the end I intend my entire tenure to be fire
And then start stealin', when I'm fittin' to be fired
I intend to go as quiet as an entire choir
Singing higher than a man walkin' on a wire
Electric lines I'm six wires higher
Can't hang sneakers from me, I'm doin' my thing
And you can't see the money Mister McGuire
But you can see the rider on his spit fire tires
R.K.F. attired I recruit in this game
1st and 15th
Long for FnF out shooting at the snakes like leather neck man
Uh a ghetto boy that got etiquette, and
You got the game messed up gotta press reset man
Or you can just ask for me and ill put you up on it like channel 3
In some shanghai dunks in a camo tee
Step stuttered like ca-ca-ca Crambone g, it was mean especially if I'm looking for a string
Hardly ever seen
I was on the creep joe
MCs ain't see me like I was hear no and speak no
Momma said I was special but theres only one eye like a peek hole
But if I poke like moe you can't peep joe
My people start calling me neo I said nah
Now its growing on me like creep show
Haters want to put x’s in my eyes like cars
But before
I let it happen I go back before the action happen with factions
That want to make a model out I
Pull up in the coupe
And get the drop up on your troops
Me and my homies in the booth mister marty mcfly fly

Dont play ya self like solitaire

Put you in monastaries for that monetary NO!
Leave you cryin in pain
What I gotta scream for hold 9 iron while Im drivin a range
You talk like I fold or somethin
Like I dont flip birdie hold eagle that'll put a hole-in-one
I'll give you cadillacs, full of apple jacks, this metal claps, this battle axe, benjamins baby
You wash the tub like tracy addlap
With my gun I produce the cali like Battlecat
You can't, handle that, ONE!

Gravity's blowing up my phone, don't wanna answer

[Intro]
We here homie
Voo doo master, Lupe Fiasco

[Verse 1]
Welcome back, an invisible storm
We've opened up the show put criminals on
Opened up the stool let em spit a few songs
Shut down the jewels put his tennis shoes on
Took off his students put his principles on
Don't believe my hype put the interviews on
They don't believe me right you was interviewed wrong
I'm believe you like a hype I'll put my chemicals on
If your such a G why the limiting ya'll
If you can say that's me then why the intervenin on
See my whole crew is ? on
Just the word of me 1st & 15 on
For the past year had to get my lean on
Stay away from the streets I was glittering on
Only bread was where heralds? put my chicken wings on
I was said to be short, but now I'm limousine long

[Chorus]
Lupe and his crew done came up while you was sleepin
FNF goin up, FNF goin up
They hate but they study and watch you they can't see em
FNF goin up, FNF goin up

[Verse 2]
I'm 5 years deep had deals galore
What they feelin now, I had to feel before
And what they feelin now I used to kill before
Grown man now I was lil before
And what's phony now wasn't real before
Told chill I wasn't ready, had to chill some more
Knew that I was hot but I wasn't cool enough
So I said I had to sit on the sill some more
And from the blocks where I made the raw
Broke down the raps and waged the war
I waited in the water and layed the law
I almost didn't make it man I braved it all
When niggas couldn't take it man I shake it off
Wore my hat where you couldn't break it off
Got a respect for the set, I would take it off
And walk down the same block from shit that you get chased off
And that's gangsta ya'll

[Chorus]
Lupe and his crew done came up while you was sleepin
FNF goin up, FNF goin up
They hate but they study and watch you they can't see em
FNF goin up, FNF goin up

[Verse 3]
You see boo Lu
I've been around the block and I done been around the millionaires
Been seated at the power meetings, yeah! I know how it feels in there
See its one thing to be put on
It's another thing to own
Niggas don't feel that there, na
Niggas is A.C. and I'm ocean breeze
Homie do you feel that air? where
I'm from West Madison
Fans across the world that's where that begun
With this flow that was wack to some
They ain't catch until that feedback from Young
Well he's back and brung?
The same flow no fun got his back to em
More Lu for you, my girls and my niggas
RIP to em, God forgive us

[Chorus]
Lupe and his crew done came up while you was sleepin
FNF goin up, FNF goin up
They hate but they study and watch you they can't see em
FNF goin up, FNF goin up
Lupe and his crew done came up while you was sleepin
FNF goin up, FNF goin up
They hate but they study and watch you they can't see em
FNF goin up, FNF goin up

[Verse 1]
To the dark, dark seas
Comes the only whale
Watching ships go by
It's the day we try

[Chorus]
It doesn't know
It's a Casio on a plastic beach, it's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a styrofoam deep sea landfill, it's a styrofoam deep sea landfill
It's automated computer speech, it's automated computer speech
It's a Casio on a plastic beach, it's a Casio

[Verse 2]
Did they haul you out
On a really hot day?
When the call got made
You had gone away
From us

[Chorus]
It doesn't know
It's a Casio on a plastic beach, it's a Casio on a plastic beach
It's a styrofoam deep sea landfill, it's a styrofoam deep sea landfill
It's automated computer speech, it's automated computer speech
It's a Casio on a plastic beach, it's a Casio

Drop classics, all 'til I fall, Hank Gathers
Weed addict, big blunts, zig-zag it
Roll it hard, ride big, Six Flag it
Automatic, Adidas sweats is sagging
My seeds been planted
All over the planet
We’re not the same, I ease off the plane
PJ’s Clear port in PJ's for days
Don’t know their names, I ain’t ask them nothing
But them hoes ain’t rolling if them hoes ain't fucking
Slick back on up
While I let these honeys just stack on up
My squad all loud: what you want to do?
I’m a 12-guage homie, you's a .22
But go ahead, my nigga, fly, just to what you do
But just know: it won’t be cool when I do it to you
I’m so in control
God blessed the child that got his own
And I got a big bone
It's Snoop Dizzle for shizzle with a brizzle when it's about to licked off

[Hook]

[Snoop Dogg]
Getting high in my C-boy stance

[Verse 2 - Snoop Dogg]
I’m stuck in my zone

Wave top flow, shit's clear like Patron
You real with me I'm real with you, you fake, then I'm gone
Fuck what you want, it's the modern day Al Capone
Going up for zippy of that nippy I put the hoes on
Stuck in the game it stays the same, nigga
The fame try to change like I'm one of these lame niggas
My chain to blame nigga, it do what you can’t nigga
LB, HIP hard in the paint, nigga
Homie, it don't stop, we get to slapping niggas, bopping niggas
Taking your girls nigga and putting Pac up in em
Hear my voice it's on point
High off life, the world my joint
XL smoke, inhale more
Small-time kid with them XL hoes

Now run the whole scene, crowned the king
Pow, pow, take those shots
Forever on the go and I don't make no stops

If money talks, mine telling yours to be seated
Cut my leg off, I wouldn’t be defeated
Illest nigga in the game, bitch
And you can retweet it
E-mail the shit, make sure you Cc it
For these fuck niggas who don’t want to believe it
I be in the airport, damn near barefoot
Security hollering out “Cole, we need it!”
Getting high as fuck and I don’t even be weeded
No point drinking, I can’t even be faded
Real recognize real like they related
You ain’t no fucking G, boy
Your style G-rated
Hatred is flattery, glad to be hated
Fucking bad bitches that would rather be dated
Carolina niggas just glad that he made it
My money was running late, now it’s happy belated

[Intro]
Yeah, hey, look

[Verse 1]
When she talk she so closed-minded
All she wanna do is shop, she so clothes minded
Wanna cop the latest 'fore them other hoes find it
Material girl yet somehow I don't mind it
Probably 'cause she so fine it'll blow your mind
She black and Pocahontas, laid back and blow that chronic
Ass so fat, wanna tat my logo on it
So any other nigga that a tap will know it's mine
I put in work overtime
Let me cut, mow the lawn, guarantee I blow your mind
She tried to play me 'til she learned I wrote a rhyme
"That's that nigga from the Ville that I heard that Hova signed
The rap form Lebron, oh girl, that boy the bomb
No chain around his neck, but better watch out for the charm"
You're not my daughter, um, but you can be my baby
Summertime, wintertime, anytime we looking for them ladies

[Chorus: J. Cole & Lee Fields (Sampled)]
Ladies, yeah
Ayy with your fat ass booty and your perty ass weave!

Beautiful ladies

[Verse 2]
She said "I got a man", well, baby I don't give a fuck
See me I understand, and I ain't tryna split you up
Okay, give me your number and later I'ma hit you up
If you sleep I get you up, ride over and pick you up
If it's clean I'll lick you up, yeah, do you research
I'll rock that ass to sleep and have you sleeping in my t-shirt
Just came home from getting my South Beach on
You know I ran the streets like a dog without a leash on
She tryna get her freak on, come hop up on this ski jet
You scared of that water or you just scared to get your weave wet?
Barely got your feet wet, yes, I know where we headed
Tryna see you throw it back, let's check your reflexes
Good Lord, didn't know what I was in for
You could be my cuddy buddy, baby, what are friends for?
I speed up the tempo, them other niggas lazy
Can't fuck with nuttin' younger than the eighties
I'm grown and I'm looking for some ladies, ladies, yeah

[Chorus: J. Cole & Lee Fields (Sampled)]
Ladies, yeah
Ayy with your fat ass booty and your perty ass weave!

But it's only for the night
Until forever, I'm so on another level
I'm so on another pedestal, my foot is on the pedal
I never ever swerve, baby, I'm on that syrup, baby
I know you fast, but I can make you -er, baby
Don't hit the curve, baby, yes, I'm for sure, baby
I know you're hot but I can make you hotter, baby
Like fur, baby, now we got PETA hatin'
But we put great to the test, and now we the greatest
And Weezy, he the greatest and this beat the greatest
And Polo, he the greatest
Rest in peace, Pimp C, the greatest
I'm gone

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
It's you and me, moving at the speed of light into eternity, yeah
Tonight is the night to join me in the middle of ecstasy
Feel the melody and the rhythm of the music
Around you, around you (Oh-oh)
I'ma take you there, I'ma take you there (Oh)
So don't be scared, I'm right here, baby
We can go anywhere, go anywhere (Yeah)
But first, it's your chance, take my hand, come with me

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
It's like I've waited my whole life (Oh) for this one night (One night, oh)
It's gon' be me, you and the dance floor (Dance floor)
'Cause we only got one night (Oh, oh, one night)
Double your pleasure, double your fun (Yeah)
And dance fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever
Fore-e-ever, forever
Fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever
Forever on the dance floor

[Bridge: Chris Brown & Lupe Fiasco]
It's a long way down, we so high off the ground
Sending for an angel to bring me your heart
Girl, where did you come from? Got me so undone
Gaze in your eyes, got me saying, "What a beautiful lady"
No ifs, ands or maybes
I'm releasing my heart and it's feeling amazing
There's no one else that matters, you love me
And I won't let you fall, girl (Uh, fall girl)
Let you fall, girl, oh

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco & Chris Brown]
You think, it's like infinity (Infinity, oh)
We're already at where we finna be (Finna be, oh)
Meaning let's make our hopes our memories (Yeah)
Happily ever after endlessly (I won't let you fall)
You the president of Me and You Industries (Let you fall)
So it's drop Love Inc. on our enemies (Let you fall)
Recycle all their negative energies (Oh)
Then build Shake Em Haters Off ministries (Oh)
Trust, God willing, they could be like us (Us)
Out of our minds, in love, you know thus (Thus)
But, until then, let's keep it on the hush
'Cause they comin' for our heads like brush cut
I interrupt the path I was going down (Yeah)
On second thought, let's keep it on the loud (Loud)
If they don't know then, then they can know now (Now)
They don't know the way to do it, then we can show 'em how

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
It's like...
It's like I've waited my whole life (Oh, whole life) for this one night (One night, oh)
It's gon' be me, you and the dance floor (Me, you and the dance floor)
'Cause we only got one night (Oh, oh)
Double your pleasure, double your fun
And dance fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever
Fore-e-ever, forever
Fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever, fore-e-ever
Forever on the dance floor

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, yeah
Forever, ever, ever, ever
Forever, ever, ever

[Verse 1]
Lately, I've been seeing things
Belly button piercings
In the sky at night
When we're side by side
And I don't mean to rain
On anybody's cabriolet
One of those games you're gonna lose
But you wanna play it, just in case

[Chorus]
Now it's getting dark and the sky looks sticky
More like black treacle than tar
Black treacle
Somebody told the stars you're not coming out tonight
And so they found a place to hide

[Verse 2]
Does it help you stay up late?
Does it help you concentrate?
Does it tune you in when you chew your chin?
Am I ruining your fun?
And you talk the talk alright
But do you walk the walk or catch the train?
You wanted it, you got it
But you don't want it now

[Chorus]
Now it's getting dark and the sky looks sticky
More like black treacle than tar
Black treacle
Somebody told the stars you're not coming out tonight
And so they found a place to hide

[Bridge]
Now I'm out of place and I'm not getting any wiser
I feel like the Sundance Kid behind a synthesizer
And I tried last night to pack away your laugh
Like a key under the mat
But it never seems to be there when you want it

[Outro]
Black treacle
Black treacle
Black treacle

[Intro: Mary J. Blige, Nicki Minaj]
I wanna make you happy
It's a hundred on the dash, gave a hundred percent
You can do the math, 20/20 vision
But you just don't see it

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Laced-up Giuseppe boots, I'm all good
Keys in that thing, interior all wood
Mountains and hills is in the rearview
But peace of mind is what I don't got
You make a girl hit up the dope spot
White line, is a thin line
Prenup been signed
So quit playing, bench time

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
I wanna make you happy, but you just don't see it
I wanna be around, babe, but I'm so tired of competing
We say all the wrong things til we make each other cry
What are we doing? Will it ever get better?

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I gave you eveything that I've got
Watch my feelings walk on by
Ever get sick of trying?
This is how I feel inside
Feel inside

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Guess who used to say "yes, boo"
Now when you say 'baby' it's fake, test tube
Jet white, we don't do JetBlue
Skinny tire on that thing, winter fresh blue
Superstar, you know I'm in the press room
That's why I'm shitting on these bitches, restroom
Ha-ha-ha-ha, that's caca, caca
Get the fuck up out my face with all that rah-rah-rah-rah
You been wack
Might send some Brooklyn niggas, get you kidnapped
With your bitch ass
Hit the dryer 'cause you washed, splish splash

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
I never thought that I would have this feeling
Do you think for once that you can truly mean it
Wasting so much time disagreeing
See, I'm to the point where I don't know what I believe in
Won't you make up your mind? Boy, decide (decide, decide)
We can't go on like this, this ain't right
I'm feeling really bad, feeling kinda low
Think it's time to go

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
I gave you eveything that I've got
Watch my feelings walk on by
Ever get sick of trying?
This is how I feel inside
Feel inside

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
Uh-huh
This is a Mary J. Blige, Nicki Minaj knockout collabo

[Intro]
What goes around comes back around (Hey, my baby!)
What goes around comes back around (My, my, my baby!)
I say, what goes around comes back around (Hey, my baby!)
What goes around comes back around

[Verse 1]
There was a time I thought
That you did everything right
No lies, no wrong
Boy, I must've been out of my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
So when I think of the time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass and I, I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it
I thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you, so baby, good looking out

[Chorus]
I wanted you bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
You turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I'm gon' always be the best thing you never had
I bet it sucks to be you right now

[Verse 2]
So sad, you're hurt
Boo hoo, oh, did you expect me to care?
You don't deserve my tears
I guess that's why they ain't there

[Pre-Chorus]
To I think that there was a time that I almost loved you
You showed your ass, and baby, yes, I saw the real you
Thank God you blew it
I thank God I dodged the bullet
I'm so over you, baby, good looking out

[Chorus]
I wanted you bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
I said, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I'll never be the best thing you never had
Oh baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now

[Bridge]
I know you want me back
It's time to face the facts
That I'm the one that's got away
Lord knows that it would take another place, another time
Another world, another life
Thank God, I found the good in goodbye

[Chorus]
I used to want you so bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
Oh, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I will always be the best thing you never had
Ooh, best thing you never had
I used to want you so bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
Oh, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
Ooh, I will never be the best thing you never had
Oh baby, I bet it sucks to be you right now

[Outro]
What goes around comes back around
What goes around comes back around
(I bet it sucks to be you right now)
What goes around comes back around
(I bet it sucks to be you right now)
What goes around comes back around
(I bet it sucks to be you right now)

[Intro]
Beautiful tats, all over my back!
Makes me so proud, I'm gonna shout it out loud!
I got another tattoo, baby! (Yeah!)
Another tattoo, baby! (noth-noth-noth-nother tattoo, babe)
Noth-nother tattoo

[Verse 1]
No part of me's blank, I'm really ink obsessed
It's like an art show the moment that I get undressed
At every job interview, they're just so impressed
Cause I got all my ex-wives on my chest
Over here is Clay Aiken, there's a side of bacon
And a minotaur pillow fighting with Satan
Next to Hello Kitty and a zombie ice-skating
Wait... It's Ronald Reagan
I got these dragons, I got these dolphins
All inscribed on me indelibly, I've had bad reactions
Bad infections, even hepatitis C
My friends think that I need therapy
Maybe some laser surgery
For the flaming goat skull on my knee
Knee, knee, knee, knee (hey...)

[Hook]
Beautiful tats (yeah), all over my back! (all over)
And I've got some space here, on the side of my face here
For another tattoo, baby! (noth-noth-noth-nother tattoo, babe)
Noth-nother tattoo
Another tattoo, baby! (noth-noth-noth-nother tattoo, babe)
Noth-nother tattoo
No, I'm not high (high), I'm really okay (okay)
I just love these scribbles (haha), that won't go away
I got another tattoo, baby! (noth-noth-noth-nother tattoo, babe)
Noth-nother tattoo
Another tattoo, baby! (noth-noth-noth-nother tattoo, babe)
Noth-nother tattoo
Yeah...

[Verse 2]
Yes, there were a few
I got from a losing a bet
I misspelled a word or two
Still there's nothing I regret
My shopping trips are no sweat
There's never stuff I forget
Check out this rad Boba Fett
He's playing clarinet!

[Hook]
Beautiful tats (yeah), all over my back! (all over)
And what the heck (haha), there's still room on my neck (waa)
I'll get another tattoo, baby! (noth-noth-noth-nother tattoo, babe)
Noth-nother tattoo
Another tattoo, baby! (noth-noth-noth-nother tattoo, babe)
Noth-nother tattoo
I don't know why (why), but every day (day)
Whenever folks see me, they just back away
I got another tattoo, baby! (noth-noth-noth-nother tattoo, babe)
Noth-nother tattoo
Another tattoo, baby! (noth-noth-noth-nother tattoo, babe)
Noth-nother tattoo
Yeah...

[*bzzt*]
OWW!
Dehh... Okay, right there by my elbow, see?
Yeah, I got a couple of square inches left
Uhhh.. Maybe a squid or a tarantula or something
I dunno, surprise me
OWW!
MOTHER...

[Verse 1]
I wrote this record while thirty thousand feet in the air
Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
If I can fuck her in front of all of these passengers
They'll probably think I'm a terrorist, eat my asparagus
Then I'm asking her thoughts of a young nigga
Fast money and freedom, a crash dummy for dollars
I know you dying to meet him, I'll probably die in a minute
Just bury me with twenty bitches, twenty million, and a Comptown fitted

[Chorus]
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Yeah, big shit poppin'
Section.80

[Verse 2]
Back in this bitch, in the back of that bitch
With my back against the wall and your bitch on the edge of my dick, jump off
I call a bitch a bitch, a ho a ho, a woman a woman
I never did nothing but break the ground on top of the asphalt
Tire mark gave you evidence that I'm easily peddlin'
With the speed of a lightning bolt
As a kid, I killed two adults, I'm too advanced
I lived my twenties at two years old, the wiser man
Truth be told, I'm like eighty-seven
Wicked as eighty reverends in a pool of fire with devils holding hands
From a distance, don't know which one is a Christian, damn
Who can I trust in 2012? there's no one, not even myself
A Gemini screaming for help, somebody

[Chorus]
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Yeah, big shit poppin', everybody watchin'
When you do it like this, nigga, losing ain't a option
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Yeah, big shit poppin'
Ayy, ayy, kick her out the studio, Ali

[Verse 3]
24/7, nigga working his ass for it, she poppin' that ass for
The King of Diamonds with diamonds, I never do ask for it
They checkin' my passport, I'm too accustomed with customs
You callin' the task force, I killed it, somebody cuff him
They want me to fast forward the game, and
Why you complain when you niggas is past poor?
You'll never hop in my lane when you pushing a RAV4
You wrecking my Jaguar
You play like a bad sport
Her feet on the dashboard

[Chorus]
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Yeah, big shit poppin', everybody watchin'
When you do it like this, nigga, losing ain't an option
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Hol' up (Hol' up), hol' up (Hol' up)
Yeah, big shit poppin', everybody watchin'
When you do it like this, nigga

[Outro]
I wrote this record while thirty thousand feet in the air
Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
If I can fuck her in front of all of these passengers
They'll probably think I'm Osama
The plane emergency landed, it was an honor
Hol' up

[Intro: Justin Bieber]
Never say never (Never, never, never)
(Pick it up, pick-pick-pick it up, pick it up, pick-pick-pick it up)
Yeah, yeah, never, -ever-ever-ever-ever, eh, eh-eh
(Pick it up, pick-pick-pick it up, pick it up, pick-pick-pick it up)

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
See, I never thought that I could walk through fire (Eh)
I never thought that I could take the burn (Eh)
I never had the strength to take it higher (Eh)
Until I reached the point of no return (Eh)

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I will never say never, I will fight
I will fight 'till forever make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up-up-up
And never say never
Ne-Never say never
Ne-Never say never
Ne-Never say never
(Never say it, never-never say it)

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I never thought that I could feel this power (Eh)
I never thought that I could feel this free (Eh)
I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower (Yeah)
And I'm fast enough to run across the sea, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
'Cause there's just no turning back (Oh, no)
When your heart's under attack (Oh, no)
Gonna give everything I have
'Cause this is my destiny

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I will never say never, I will fight (Never say never!)
I will fight 'till forever make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up-up-up
And never say never (Never, never, never, never)

[Verse 3: Jaden & Justin Bieber]
Here we go!
Guess who?
J Smith and JB
Uh-huh
I gotcha, lil bro
I can handle them
Hold up, aight? I can handle them
Now he's bigger than me, taller than me
And he's older than me and stronger than me
And his arms a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a JB song with me
I be trying a chill, they be trying to sour the thrill
No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will
Like Luke with the force, if push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the 4th, ice water for blood (Let's go!)
I gotta be the best, and yes, we're the flyest
Like David and Goliath, I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand
I was born from two stars, so the moon's where I land (I'm gone)

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Jaden]
I will never say never, I will fight (Never say it, never-never say it)
I will fight 'til forever, to make it right (Okay, okay)
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up-up-up
And never say never
Never say never
I will never say never (Never say it, never-never say it)
Never say never
I will fight 'till forever make it right (Okay, okay)
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up-up-up
And never say never

[Outro: Justin Bieber & Jaden]
Ne-Never say never (Never say it)
Ne-Never say never (Never say it)
Ne-Never say never (Never say it)
And never say never (No, no, never say never)
Ne-Never say never (Never say it)
Ne-Never say never (Ne-Ne-Never say it)
Ne-Never say never
And never say never (Never, never, never)

[Intro: Sample]
"Three minutes forty five seconds and counting, we are still a go at this time"

[Verse 1]
Listening to Star Trek’s star tracks
On the track to stars and back
Only after we get to the end

Passing planets feeling small
On the mattress floating off
How you breathing up here with nothing on, nothing on, baby girl

[Climb]
But you look good in your spacesuit
I can't keep my hands off you
Plus it's easy to love you
Oh, up here, up here

[Hook]
I'mma take it slow, slow
While the rockets burn, they burning
We'll be making love, baby
Rocket love, rocket love ooohhh
"Two minutes ten seconds and counting"

[Verse 2]
The candle's burning in the sun
We don't need them but you like them
They glow they glow, oh yeah
We were at the bar for quite a while
Took some time but we collided
Big bang, Big bang, look at what we made beautiful

[Climb]
But you look good in that spacesuit
I can't keep my hands off you
Plus it's easy to love you
Oh, up here, up here

[Hook]
I'mma take it slow, slow
While the rockets burn, they burning
We'll be making love, baby
Rocket love, rocket love ooohhh

[Verse 3]
We can make believe that we're up there
But we're only in the backseat of this eclipse oohh
If the lights go by, that means the cops flew by
But they won't bother us, no no no no

[Hook x2]
I'mma take it slow, slow
While the rockets burn, they burning
We'll be making love, baby
Rocket love, rocket love ooohhh
I'mma take it slow, slow
While the rockets burn, they burning
We'll be making love, baby
Rocket love, rocket love ooohhh

[Outro: Sample]
"20 seconds and counting
T minus 15 seconds, guidance is internal
12, 11, 10, 9, ignition sequence start
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, all engines running
Lift off, we have a lift off, lift off"

[Verse 1: DC Pierson]
Mapquest where the place is
Gats in they faces
Then we fold them up and put them back in they cases
Assassins replace expressions on faces
And hard eyes on gangsters with hot gaping spaces
Hands full of aces, pockets on swole
Glassy-eyed aiming from my own grassy knoll
Leave JFK’s head just a big smoky hole
To console Jackie O she could smoke my pole
It’s called Camelot ‘cause she came a lot
And a lot of you rappers sound the same a lot
And the game is still out there if you play or not
And I’m the King of Queens, Kevin James is not
I quit my temp job ‘cause I can’t let a day go
Tomorrow’s moguls are delivering your bagels
I hope your trophy wife been practicing her Kegels
Cause when we take the game we won’t leave you any Legos
There go the kid with his dirty white sneakers on
Dreaming on a way to get his penthouse on Bleecker on
Give your girl head, call you with the speaker on
Horse head in your bed, now you know who you sleeping on
Are you seeing what I’m seeing?
This booth is a crime scene
Chalk off the mic, the kill screen is my screen
No need to terrify or pop shots at witnesses
They only testified they know what hot shit this is

[Hook: Childish Gambino]
True assassins
Hold your glass up
Them's the type of niggas that’ll cut yo ass up
Whether it be tracks or verses
Chains or purses
Them the type of niggas that’ll make you stop
True assassins
Hold your glass up
Them's the type of niggas that’ll cut yo ass up
Whether it be tracks or verses
Chains or purses
Them the type of niggas that’ll make you stop

[Verse 2: Nick Packard]
Classic assassin
Straight from Central Castin’
I bust through your abode with both barrels blastin’
I crush up your skull like a truck that you crashed in
I’m never gonna die like I’m Tuck Everlasting
Never thought that I’d carry an AK
All I ever wanted to be is Farley, Ferrell, or Fey
And maybe some day that dream will come true
But for now I got my gun and I’m aiming at you (Hey!)
In your house on your couch while you’re readin’
I got no flow, it’s more like breakthrough bleedin’
But I’m into cartoons and I’m really not sane
All I leave of your body is a Pinky and the Brain (Uh!)
I’m more Manson than a small-time crook
When it comes to taking lives I steal like Dane Cook
Bitch, take a look, you know it’s in a book
Even LeVar Burton’s Roots get shook

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
Ah, ah, you can call me assassin, I kill Versace
I walk too much, gotta Gucci watch me
The illest of the killers you can tell by my fashion
Light hoodie to bright sneaks it’s all matchin'
I kill rappers, I don’t need no stealin’
If I do lose a battle I’mma kill ‘em for real
I’m just kidding, or am I?
Things get real in the City of L.I
That’s right, I live in Queens
The borough of the lost
I hate the fuckin’ yuppies but I love how much it costs
Call me in the winter and the spring to play tennis
And they give me strange looks ‘cause I floss like a dentist
I’mma finish this sentence then get me a rope
So I got a little dough and I’m fresh like Scope
A nigga so dope, I got the new Pumas
I never take 'em out so I call ‘em homeschoolers
Numbers like rulers, I’m tired of it all
I sleep in the club and I yawn when I ball
I’m off the hook like phone calls
Where’s Kidrobot?
I need a new hoodie hot pink like doughnuts
The kids is Go-Gurts when they see my Gobstoppers
I’m not Mekhi Phifer, but I got Clockers
Transform a watch when I don’t got diamonds
Boy, did you hear what I said like Simon?
I kill boutiques
Just snatch the new sneak
I’ma do it every week
I’m a serial killer
Beats like Dilla
Hun like ‘Tilla
It’s the Sick Boi Thrilla (Yeah, mon!)

[Hook: Childish Gambino]
True assassins
Hold your glass up
Them's the type of niggas that’ll cut yo ass up
Whether it be tracks or verses
Chains or purses
Them the type of niggas that’ll make you stop
True assassins
Hold your glass up
Them's the type of niggas that’ll cut yo ass up
Whether it be tracks or verses
Chains or purses
Them the type of niggas that’ll make you stop

[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah, look how I came up
Yeah, ayy, look how I came up, nigga
Ayy, look

[Verse]
Momma I came up
Cold as hell in New York but I flame up
Straight up out that dirty type of shit you cannot clean up
A dollar and a dream the only things I had to bring up
Now any nigga out there gunning for me gotta aim up
Say what, niggas ask me what the Ville be like
Just tell em that it's real, hoping that they me feel me, right
I'm so bright I close my eyes and I can still see light
I'm so live you motherfuckers gotta kill me twice
Man, I promise I'm murdering classics, paying my homage
The fifteenth of the month and I'm just now paying Mohammed
Said the rent's due on the first, but he don't know the shit
I been through and it hurts, can't wait to blow
Yeah, I think about heaven sometimes, can't wait to go
If it's real will I even get in, I ain't fo' sure
'Cause I've been sinning
Getting bent it's been a minute since I been
Up in a church
Only time is when my friend up in a hearse
Lord, I'm praying for my Momma
I just went up in her purse
Not to steal
All I saw was some bills and not a dollar
In sight
It’s time she lived a more desirable life
I'm chasing money
And dreams only God got the means to take em from me
I scheme while I'm riding through Queens
I ain't no dummy
A Fayettenam repper 'til the day I'm gone
Nigga get your weight up all the way up if you hating on me
Cause boy I might pray but ain't no preying on me
I'm hot like Satan just laying on me
So when you get to hell you can say you know me
I said I might pray but ain't no preying on me
So when you get to hell, you can say you know me

[Intro: Lil Wayne, Tyga & D.A. Wallach]
Hello world, my name is not important

Lay you, lay you, down
Yeah, let's go

[Hook: D.A. Wallach]

Your life's in my cham-ber
Don't make me let off a round
If my life's in dan-ger
I'm gonna lay you down, lay you down

[Verse 1: Tyga & D.A. Wallach]
Uh, I ain't a killer but don't push me
Only soft shit I'm into nigga is pussy
Hard head, from a city where really you blue or all red
Like, when it pop off (pop pop) better play dead
Lay you, lay you, down
Hah, same day, catch me on some different shit
Hah, front yard, posted on some prison shit
Uh, even as a kid, fight until you win
Life is kill or be killed, yeah

[Hook: D.A. Wallace & Lil Wayne]
I got these bullets in my cham-ber (yeah)
Don't make me let off a round (so like I said)
If my life's in dan-ger (or better yet like he said)
I'm gonna lay you down, lay you down
Your life's in my cham-ber
Don't make me let off a round
If my life's in dan-ger
I'm gonna lay you down, lay you down (get 'em boy)

[Verse 2: Tyga & D.A. Wallach]
Uh, I like to floss so mama told me be cautious
She know the cost, she told me death ain't a option
Too many lives lost, shootout on the boulevard
Guns drawn, pick a card, lucky me, I wasn't home
Lay you, lay you, down
Damn, I hope it, wasn't one of my homies dawg
His family called, I ain't even hear my phone
Now I'm looking for revenge, swerving on this road
If I should die and never wake, pray the Lord take my soul
But you already know

[Hook: D.A. Wallace & Lil Wayne]
I got these bullets in my cham-ber (yeah)
Don't make me let off a round (so like I said)
If my life's in dan-ger (or better yet like he said)
I'm gonna lay you down
Your life's in my cham-ber
Don't make me let off a round
If my life's in dan-ger (ya heard?)
I'm gonna lay you down, lay you down
Better make me love you, baby!

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne & D.A. Wallach]
Ahem, reporting live from the barrel (get 'em!)
Two tear drops under that eye on the sparrow (ughh!)
I'm from a small place they call Uptown
Where we (lay you) where we (lay you) hahahah (down)
Like concrete in the driveway, shoot sideways
Like O-Dog on "Menace", leave you brains in yo' tennis
I'm the Renaissance Man, so put me in the book
And I got my pistol on the hook, sing, hahahah

[Hook: D.A. Wallace]
I got these bullets in my cham-ber
Don't make me let off a round
If my life's in dan-ger
I'm gonna lay you down
Your life's in my cham-ber
Don't make me let off a round
If my life's in dan-ger
I'm gonna lay you down, lay you down

[Outro: Lil Wayne & D.A. Wallach]
When I say "fuck y'all"

Tyga Tyga (lay you) Young Money (lay you)
I thought you knew (down)
Lay you, lay you, down

[Intro banter]

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
My flow like Hawk Jones
The little bitty one
Hit me on my iPhone
You can text me when I'm done
I'm sicker than your grandparents honey
I'm sicker than that bitch at the end of Ben Button
Your mixtapes mean nothing
I put out albums in a week
Eat these other rappers rhymes
That is why my breath stink
You get fucked like nymphos
These clothes make niggas roll up their windows
These Frito banditos
Cause they're like chips
Cause they talk shit see me then dip
These niggas round here
They don't let your tongue slip
Send you black and blue
Like you an African crip
My green like a weird watermelon
No seeds
And my green like a weird watermelon
All leaves
My green don't fit in my white skinny jeans
Cause I move anywhere
So I guess I'm the queen

[Hook]
Yes, yes I'm so Hawk Jones
Yes yes I'm so Hawk Jones
Yes yes I'm so Hawk Jones
Yes, yes Andre show 'em how it's done

[Verse 2: Dree Dei (Andree Vermuelen)]
Whoever wanna climb this beanstalk is gonna find me
No, I'm not a giant, but my name is An-dree
Oops, I meant Andree
Add an extra “e” and the accent mark
Yes it’s Dree, not Dreeeeee
He's so confused cause he thought I was a boy
Well, I got two Mounds but no Almond Joy
And all these fools wanna taste my cream
Infatuation thick like a slab of good brie
Infatuation real all they think of is me
Yes all these fucking Charlies got a lactose disease
But they not intolerant, they daydream more than moderate
It's just not a meal until you sprinkle Parmesan on it
It's just not a get until you give all you got on it
It's just not a cock until you pumpin' all of your heart in it
Look at him staring at my lips
Ain't they thicker than a pair of African hips
I thought we was friends, but he think we gon' kiss
Here he comes leaning in, he swing, he miss
How's it feel to taste a mouthful of air yes
How's it feel to kiss me knowing I am not there

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
Boy I need a censor, boy you need a mentor
These boys need to be lead like they're two pencils
Yes I'm a black nerd, it's that simply
Call me poindexter or the black Ed Grimly
Girl attitude stay stank like kimchi
But she ain't Korean and her boy ain't friendly
Turn your girls that are friends to fuck buddies
Keep 'em on the wire, that's why I cuddy
And every girl that I'm friends with wants to fuck
That's why she waits till I'm drunk, then she runs amok
Guess boy my name's an aphrodisiac
Yes boy at the hotel's where I leave 'em at
I am Animaniac cause I'm so wacko
Better warn a brother when you see a chick act ho
And even if she's so Angel that she's on Bones
No girl is so fly to fuck with Hawk Jones

[Hook]
Yes, yes I'm so Hawk Jones
Yes yes I'm so Hawk Jones
Yes yes I'm so Hawk Jones
So why don't these motherfuckers just leave me alone

[Intro]
Mic check Ali
The mic don't sound right

Even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick
Even the shooters can get shot (Ali get it right)
Even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick
Even the shooters can get shot
Uhh

[Verse 1]
Tell em I got plenty arson to sell em
Heat by the fleet displaying it very seldomly
I write till I ignite my cerebellum
Close to the pen like I had 3 felons
Come from a city where niggas show no remorse
And a corpse is just another hommy taking it's course
Of course my dream was to play in the Final Four
Till the twelfth grade came and I was only 5'4
So now I'm a graduate looking to get hired
My pops knew a security job he inquired
But ignorance is bliss, that's what I was told
I stopped, dropped and rolled when somebody yelled fired
Now there goes another black boy unemployed
With a lot of free time which means he's vulnerable to run into a lot of crime
I wrote it in my rhymes
And when I left the porch this is what I realized
(Chorus)
Even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick
Even the shooters can get shot (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick
Even the shooters can get shot (yeah, yeah, yeah, wassup?)
These streets ain't none to play with
It could get outrageous
Got burners, .45's and gauges
That could really get outrageous

[Verse 2]
So I'm thinking to myself, what's next?
My security job only got me like 2 checks
My pops disappointed, told me I'm fuckin' up
Irresponsible and I need some growing up
I told him I would go back, knowing I wouldn't go back
Working a 9 to 5 is something I couldn't stomach
Surrounded by the violence
All the goons and the goblins
With 99 problems I still kept it 100
These streets can be rather manipulating
Especially when you're black and just turned 18
So what's a kid to do, when your fresh out of school and the negatives of the world constantly following you?
Not to mention a local henchman, copped a sheriff's part like terrorists
Osama with badges that talk arrogant
That boy 15 and he holdin' a .45
30 years apart, 30 years before he realized

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Uhh
Soon as the beat drop, I bet some heat pop
On a block close to you like a relative
You sippin' Belvedere while these niggas plannin' to rob Mr. Belvedere
Yeah I'm a good kid tryna stay righteous as Martin Luther but it seems like all of my friends eventually become shooters
And niggas bangin' on you is something that you'll get used to
You can either fight back or run home and grab your ruger
Whatever you do just make sure you're willing to do it
Being too indecisive can get you killed inside your Buick
Cuz you stopped at the light, 5 minutes from midnight
With no tinted windows that nigga surely had shot through it
You tell me you listening, but you don't hear the music
Call you Billy Hoyle when turmoil was near
This is the realest right here
When I lost my very first job
My pops said why?
I said I couldn't aim for the sky
Cuz even shooters can get shot

[Outro]
(yeah, yeah, yeah, wassup?)
These streets ain't none to play with
It could get outrageous
Got burners, .45's and gauges
That could really get outrageous
Im starting off my day wit a blunt of purp, no pancakes just a cup of syrup
Bakin soda pot and a silver fork, you already kno it's time to go to work
Im back off in the kitchen working wit a chicken
You get 63 grams for my 12-50. 50 pounds of purp 50 pounds of 

[?]
And soon as it gon I sold anotha 60
My baby need some shoes my auntie need a purse
Summer comin real soon so I need vurp
I hop up out dat van wit dat duffle bag
And if a nigga try me I'mma bust his ass
Im counting up money in my living room
Birds errwhere I call it da chicken room
Pillz in da cabinet pounds in da den
Attic full of good basement full of benjamins
2 ak-47's and a blow-torch, couple junkies knockin hard on my front porch
A couple old school's in my backyard, if I dont kno ya I'mma serve you through my burgular bars

(Chorus)
Gucci back bitch yeah im back bitch
Did you miss me or miss my raps bitch
Dis dat new shit
Dat county jail shit
Dat seven flow rice street straight outta cell shit
You on my shit list im on da Forbes list
Since I'mma rich nigga I need a rich bitch
I gotta sick wrist; it cost bout six bricks
Im on dat slick shit dat zone six shit

[Hook]
I wanna her I really want her I think I want her
Your girl friend is left with me yeah she's a goner
And I wanna I really want her I got to have her
Now I gotta yeah Gucci gotta I'm bout to smash her
X2

[Verse 1]
Yall ball when yall can but I stunt when I wanna
Your girlfriend wanna fuck me I think were gonna
Marijuana got my beamer foggy as a sauna
I'm Gucci Mane La Flare bitch im such a prima donna
I'm East Atlanta shawty but I hang where I wanna
Got a plug in Arizona but used to slang on the corner
Gotta chocolate nerdy lookin chick a ryder like wynona
Told her text my celly plenty when she come from california
You are not the owner of that car that is a loaner, I got money stacks as tall as you cuz that's just my persona
I got half a million on my neck come try me if you wanna
Keep a shooter wit a chopper turn you to a organ donor

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
My flow so schizophrenic that I think I need a straightjacket
Straight drop dope flow put me in a crack baggie
Old school like a 1960 cadillac                                                                                      Real well known in every hood that's why these nigga's swagga jackin'
Not in my league nowhere close to my tax bracket
Brick squad charm bout the same size of a tennis racket
Thirty round tone in my jeans got my pants saggin
Let yo girlfriend give me becky now the bitch braggin, rims to the white chain to watch hat to the shoes matchin', since im Gucci Mane might as well buy her some new glasses, everybody still Lookin at me when my vette passing, brick squad ceo I guarentee the check cashes

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Six stoves in my house and everybody cooking
Ferrari pass by damn everybody looking
A couple million dollars and im still straight crooked
You might had the game on hold but I took it
Im hoppin out the drop lambo like a kangaroo
Gucci brick squad ceo but tell me who the fuck is you
Like simon says yo' big sister do what I tell her to
I tape bricks underneath her tits and then I send her through
Milatary rifles you would think I was a ex-marine
Sk, street sweeper, mac 90 or m16
No im not a fighter or a lover I am just a shooter, so if you disrespect my squad I'mma have to shoot ya'

[Hook]

[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
If I had the moment, I'd capture that moment
You would be right here next to me
If I had the secret, the secret to your love
I would place the treasure beneath my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
Lock it all up and throw away the key
I would never give it, it up
'Cause I was just a fool, a fool for you
When I loved you so childishly

[Chorus]
And I want it all back
I want it all, I want it all, girl, I want it all back
I want it all back
I want it all, I want it all, girl, I want it all
You never miss a good thing 'til it's gone
I want it all, now I want it all (Back)

[Verse 2]
If there is a green light and it starts to turn yellow
Pedal to the floor 'cause I know your heart is turning red
If I had the minutes, I would turn 'em into hours
And make love to your mind and not your body instead

[Pre-Chorus]
I was just a fool, a fool for you
That didn't know what I had until I lost you
Now every single moment that you're not here
It's evident to me that everything just seems so clear

[Chorus]
And I want it all back (I gotta have it all, have it all back, yeah)
I want it all, I want it all, girl, I want it all back (Yeah)
I want it all back (Yeah)
I want it all, I want it all, girl, I want it all
You never miss a good thing 'til it's gone
I want it all, now I want it all (Back)

[Bridge]
Now everything isn't everything
If everything, everything isn't with you, yeah (Wow!)

[Chorus]
And I want it all back
I want it all, I want it all, girl, I want it all back
I want it all back (Yeah!)
I want it all, I want it all, girl, I want it all
You never miss a good thing 'til it's gone
I want it all, now I want it all (Back)

[Outro]
Now I want it all back
Now I want it all back
Now I want it all back

Don't listen to what that nigga say
'Cause he's just saying you can do better
And baby, all I'm saying is he sound like a hater
And baby, he can just fuck off and do us a favor
Mind your business, nigga, stop being a hater

[Verse 1]
This is for them 20-somethings
Time really moves fast, you were just sixteen
This is for them 30-somethings
That didn't turn out exactly how your mom and dad wanted you to be
This is for them 40-somethings
Well, raise up your glass and laugh like a motherfucker
This is for them 50-somethings
Hell, you're halfway there, baby, take it to the head

[Refrain]
Mom and Dad tried to hide the world
Said, the world's just too big for a little girl
Eyes wide open, can't you see?
I had my first heels by the age of 13
Mom and Dad tried to hide the boys
I swear that just made 'em want me more
At 14, they asked me what I wanna be
I said, "Baby, 21, so I get me a drink"

[Chorus]
I'm not a teacher, babe, but I can teach you somethin'
Not a preacher, but we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor, but I can make you feel better
But I’m great at writing physical love letters
I'm a freak, all day, all night
Hot, top, flight, boy I'm out of sight
And I’m crazy, all day, all night
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh (Schoolin’ life)
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh (Schoolin’ life)

[Verse 2]
This is for them pretty somethings
Livin' in the fast lane, see you when you crash, babe
This is for them sexy somethings
That body ain't gon' always get you out of everything
This is for them bitter somethings
Stop living in regret, baby, it's not over yet
And this is for them chipper somethings
That's high on life, baby, put me on your flight

[Chorus]
I'm not a teacher, babe, but I can teach you somethin'
Not a preacher, but we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor, but I can make you feel better
But I’m great at writing physical love letters
I'm a freak, all day, all night
Hot, top, flight, boy I'm out of sight
And I’m crazy, all day, all night
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh (Schoolin’ life)
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh (Schoolin’ life)

[Bridge]
You know it costs to be the boss
One day you'll run the town
For now, make your life what you decide
Baby, party 'til the fire marshals shut this sucker down

[Chorus]
I'm not a teacher, babe, but I can teach you somethin'
Not a preacher, but we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor, but I can make you feel better
But I’m great at writing physical love letters
I'm a freak, all day, all night
Hot, top, flight, boy, I'm out of sight
And I’m crazy, all day, all night
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
(Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?) Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
(Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?) Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh

[Outro]
There's not a real way to live this, for real
Just remember to stay relentless
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Don't stop running until it's finished
Yeah, yeah
It's up to you, the rest is unwritten
Hey, hey, hey
My trap house like Morehouse it got niggas all around it
Yoo trap like a whore house probly in there cooking brownies
Spellman, Spellman, ain't nothing you can tell them
My goons trained to go but you squad pussier then Spellman
We stomp u like the q dogs aka alpha kalpa
Gambling with a poolshark. Find yo body in Alpharetta
College Campus Kush Pack 3 blunts make the party start
Dont make me stop burning kush then start burning your body parts!
Zone 6 still ma alma mater im valedictorian
Girl just broke up with me said I fucked the whole sorority
Retarted all the time I was bumpin and choppin authority
Tell it to my Nine cause you bitch niggas be boring me!
Chorus
He's got made for teenagers scary ain't draw
But if you have the heart we can link up and have fun
They drink up all of the fuck in locker made bud
Cause these cowards dats a thousand and soldiers they die as one
You know it's what these bitches in Atlanta keep goin
Don't keep up the security of the key blunt no glory for the team with scarce money and no guns
Cause a coward dats a thousand a soldiers die as one
I empty out the clip believe me that's not a myth
I murk you on the scrifin one question I plead the fifth
Your kush pack and my cocaine whiter than Taylor swift
And they taylor make my bread and dine collar costs me a grip
I'm cleaner than a whistle black diamonds matchin my pistols
So beefin with me nigga best keep yo head on a swivel
Quarter ticket every week and you dig it that's how I kick it
So you can leave the money and you can have all the bitches
Pardon my apology now rappers theys not as hard as me
Avoiding me that's obviously cause they know they just frosted me
I brought to me you softer than Charmin that's not hard to see
I own the street every beat that I speak of my fans applauded me

[Hook]

I'm back in the maybach I'm blowin Kush in the back
Eight thousand dollars for the set time to roll me another vette
Tha police pull me over they think of they catch a trap
Don't know it's only for the personal uses, what's up with that?
My rist and kicks so rocksy I'm choppin yo game with terrince BURR. I'm worn in 6 impark talkin cockin thank to me parents BURR. You strippers seen ten k worth of singles they squeezin they nipples. I tempt one till she swivals dat bitch says u a cripple. I keep word to a minimal now rappers they wanna hush. I gotta say too much cause my jewelry can say enough BURR. I'm keep um that why you niggas ain't keep enough. You say u poppin deep dish yo pockets ain't deep enough

[Hook]
Shit, whose house is this?
Laughin' so hard my tongue is out and shit
I stack dead Prez, mouth to mouth that shit
They told me a nigga wouldn't amount to shit
Nigga, whose house is this?
Laughin' so hard my tongue is out and shit
I stack dead Prez, mouth to mouth that shit
But you don't know nothin' about that, shit

[Verse 1]
Yellin', whose house is this? Huh
Bitch, Do I even gotta ask now?
Who the fuck are you? Do you even got you a pass?
I don't know why you cuffin' yo girl, she ain't even got her no ass
Middle fingers to all of the nonbelievers
Not only did I beat the odds, I also got even
Took a spot up on the throne, I see myself see myself
Said it twice cause history repeats itself 'peats itself
Man I can't even lie, I be high I be high
Mother fuck drinkin' and drivin', I'd rather get high and fly
I'm out of here, like outer wear
We are not the same, you are not a player
My house is somewhere off in the woods, girls in my bed like I'm papa bear
They say hard work pays off, wrong it pays good as hell
You the man huh? Sorry I couldn't tell
Claimin' that they BIG, well I really can't lie
From the top they all look the same size

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I start my mornin' with the paper
Bitch I'm rich free press, hundreds on all the pages
And you can't slow me down, I'm sorry there's no delay
Me and my committee run the city, you just tryin' to join the relay
Leader of the new school, reportin' from the PA
These niggas call me cuz but I don't know why, cause we can't relate
I got yo sister doin' thangs on camera I can't replay
But she's a waste of time, fuck I could've had a V8
I turn thousands to milli's, it's time to renovate the ceiling
I'm turning houses to buildings, hustle while you out here chilling
What's the wordy I'm certainly getting rich in a hurry
I swear I fuck 'til I'm tired, I'm getting high 'til it's blurry
I'm from the dirty glove, where hammers turn crews into jurys
They'll make you sit down, but as long as you with me ain't no worries
Man I'm puttin' on for my crew, never for these hoes
I'm puttin' on for my city, she puttin' on her clothes

[Hook]

[Intro]
H.O.C., H.O.C
All the real smokers get me H.O.C
All the real smokers get me H.O.C
H.O.C., H.O.C
All the real smokers get me H.O.C
All the real smokers get me H.O.C

[Verse 1]
Everybody know I spit that other shit
Shit that make you duck for cover shit
Shit that make you hop out your seat and slap your mother shit
Especially when Drop drop the beat
I drop jewels like my nuts dropped out of my briefs
Jump in the booth and shatter every rapper's dream
They jump in a sauna because I killed their self-esteem
That's a jab, you should bob and weave
Like Pam when Martin pulled jokes out his sleeve
I go in studio sessions and feel like a nerd
Cause I'm the only nigga there not smoking no herb
You telling me the kush make you think on level four?
I'm on five, you saying that I can level more?
In high school, my teachers thought I was smoking stress
Didn't know my eyes low cause of genetic defects
I stimulate my mind every time I think about the end of time
Creation of man, and Columbine

[Chorus]
Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote
Probably think I'm off the kush or the hydro
(Nope) I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I really appreciate that you share your Indo
But a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke

[Verse 2]
Look, nowadays everybody think they're big chiefers
Just cause they heard that new tape from Wiz Khalifa
Knowing damn well they can't hit the sour
They're new booties, they probably need baby powder
My skill shower over your city for 40 days
40 nights, off the chain, like freedom of slaves
Before you get it twisted, like 40 gays
My flow worth the earth, that's not to be appraised
Those the type of lines that I'm talking 'bout
You know the type of rhymes you don't talk about
Copy my session on a disc when the session ends
So my momma can have it and play it for her friends
Brag on me, like "My son's 'bout to win
Somehow, someday, and I don't care when"
I might hit the gin once a month
I'll let you inhale, like an atheist

[Chorus]
Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote
Probably think I'm off the kush or the hydro
(Nope) I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I really appreciate that you share your Indo
But a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke

[Verse 3]
I'll take you back to the 9th grade
When Dough Boy had me high for 4 days
That's my nigga, he a street nigga
Probably in your hood, fucking up your street, nigga
But anyway I think it was some purple
Told me "Don't hit it hard because it'll hurt you"
I didn't listen, I was floating like the Rose Parade
Swear to God a nigga seen some flying fishes
That was the Vegas trip, Hooters sponsored
The same time I start writing like a fucking monster
I'm Frankenstein every time this mothafucker ponders
Just underline every letter, capital K-D-O-T
Laying it flat out, like a tire with slow leaks
Now what you 'bout? Nothing huh
Am I a square cause I don't puff a square?
Are my raps too blunt to hit the blunt? Yeah

[Chorus]
Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote
Probably think I'm off the kush or the hydro
(Nope) I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I really appreciate that you share your Indo
But a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke

[Outro]
H.O.C., H.O.C
All the real smokers give me H.O.C
(Bitch I'm blowed!)

[Verse 1]
Very superstitious
Writing's on the wall
Very superstitious
Ladder's about to fall
Thirteen month old baby
Broke the looking glass
Seven years of bad luck
The good things in your past

[Chorus]
When you believe in things
That you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way

[Verse 2]
Very superstitious
Wash your face and hands
Rid me of the problem
Do all that you can
Keep me in a daydream
Keep me going strong
You don't want to save me
Sad is my song

[Chorus]
When you believe in things
That you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way

[Verse 3]
Very superstitious
Nothing more to say
Very superstitious
The devil's on his way
Thirteen month old baby
Broke the looking glass
Seven years of bad luck
Good things in your past

[Chorus]
When you believe in things
That you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way
No, no, no

[Intro: Mike]
Girl, you know we belong together
I have no time for you to be playin' with my heart like this
You'll be mine forever, baby, you just see

[Verse 1: Nathan]
We belong together
And you know that I'm right
Why do you play with my heart
Why do you play with my mind?
Said we'd be forever
Said it'd never die
How could you love me and leave me
And never say goodbye?

[Pre-Chorus: Wanya]
When I can't sleep at night without holding you tight
Girl, each time I try, I just break down and cry
Pain in my head, oh, I'd rather be dead
Spinnin' around and around

[Chorus: All]
Although we've come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you
Come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you

[Verse 2: Shawn]
Girl, I know you really love me
You just don't realize
You've never been there before
It's only your first time
Maybe I'll forgive you, mmm
Maybe you'll try
We should be happy together
Forever, you and I

[Pre-Chorus: Wanya]
Will you love me again like you loved me before?
This time, I want you to love me much more
This time instead, just come to my bed
And baby, just don't let me, don't let me down, oh

[Chorus: All & Wanya]
Although we've come to the end of the road (End of the road)
Still I can't let go (The end of the road and I know I can't let go, baby)
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you (I don't know what I'm gonna do)
Come to the end of the road (I don't know what I'm gonna do 'cause I know I've come to the end of the road, the end of the road)
Still I can't let go (Oh my God, oh my God, help me out a little bit, baby)
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you

[Interlude: Mike & Shawn]
Girl, I'm here for you
All those times at night when you just hurt me
And just ran out with that other fella
Baby, I knew about it, I just didn't care
You just don't understand how much I love you, do you?
I'm here for you
I'm not out to go out and cheat all night (Baby, I'm here for you, baby)
Just like you did, baby, but that's alrright
Heh, I love you anyway (Baby, you tried)
And I'm still gonna be here for you 'til my dying day, baby
Right now, I'm just in so much pain, baby (We should be happy together forever)
'Cause you just won't come back to me (You and I)
Will you? Just come back to me (Yeah, yeah)

[Interlude: Mike & All]
(Lonely) Yes, baby, my heart is lonely
(Lonely) My heart hurts, baby
(Lonely) Yes, I feel pain too
(Lonely) Baby, please

[Pre-Chorus: Wanya]
This time instead, just come to my bed
And baby, just don't let me down

[Chorus: All & (Wanya)]
Although we've come to the end of the road (We've come to the end of the road)
Still I can't let go (I know I just can't let go, no)
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you (No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
(I don't know what I'm gonna do)
Come to the end of the road (I don't know what I'm gonna do 'cause I know I've come to the end of the road, the end of the road)
Still I can't let go (Oh my God, oh my God, help me out a little bit, baby)
It's unnatural (Baby), you belong to me (Baby), I belong to you (Baby)
Although we've come to the end of the road
Still I can't let go (Alright, alright, alright)
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you (It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you, woah)
Come to the end of the road (Although we've come to the end of the road)
Still I can't let go (I know I just can't let go, no)
It's unnatural, you belong to me, I belong to you (No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
Hey there material girl
The neighbors told me that you're moving out
Leaving to witness the world
But are you sure that's what you're doing now

Are you running away for a purpose
Do you even know what your self worth is
The passport you carry in your purse is
The gift in the curse when you going head first is
The ATL, MIA, LAX, JFK
Luggage all packed and to them I say
Farewell to the pure, amen I pray

You wander the world
You seek what you've lost
You're waking up every day
The run away, run away girl
I turn and your gone
You're leaving to chase your fame
The run away, the run away girl
So long
Farewell
Good bye
Good day
Be on
Your way
Run away girl
(x2)

Watching it all through the window
And wishing you could make it shatter now
Now that you're here on the other side
Are you sure it even matters

Are you living the dream
Are you telling all your girls that it ain't what it seems
Do you strip do you model do you live in between
And look for the split second that you get on the screen like

You wander the world
You seek what you lost
You're waking up every day
To run away, run away girl
I turn and you're gone
You're leaving to chase your fame
You run away, run away girl
So long
Farewell
Good bye
Good day
Be on your way
Run away girl
(x2)

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
When I close my eyes that's when she appears
I grab her by the thighs and I pull her near
But to my surprise it's just what I fear
Cause when I turn on the lights there's no one there

[Hook]
I am by myself and I'm dancing all alone
I am by myself and I know that nobody's home
I am by myself and I'm dancing all alone
I am by myself and I know that nobody's home

[Bridge]
There's no one there, when I turn on the lights
There is no one there, when I turn on the

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
And just like that she's right back
She'll stay the night as long as I play the right track
She likes the lights low
And when she winds slow
I'm buyin' what she's selling
Ain't no telling where my mind goes
She leaves my mind blow like old speakers
She always comes and goes but I never leave her
She is like my favorite cut or replay
She makes them paper cuts go away
I hope she stays

[Hook x 3]

[Intro: DJ Khaled & Jadakiss]
DJ, DJ, DJ Khaled! (Ah-hah!)

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
I said we the best at making this green
I swear Mountain Dew ain't got nothing on my team
F is for the family that’s holding me down
I think niggas know who run this town
A is for the action I’m all about
Blow a nigga head off, kill all the doubt
B is for the big boys with the grown money
And bad bitches who ain't gotta spend their own money
Shots of 'Tron at like 4 in the morn'
It ain't over til it’s over, Loso I'm gone

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
The lights stay on, they don't fade
Ohh-ohh-whoa-ohh
Take my last call, don’t hold your breath
Ohh-ohh-whoa-ohh
Everyday make something outta nothing
Move a mountain and still keep running
Never come down, make no mistakes

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
They can say, ayy, ooh, that my end is on the horizon
When I wake, ooh, all I see is the sun rising
Just when I thought I said all there was to say
I get the last word, it ain't over til it's over
Just when I thought I did all there was to do
I give my best to you, it ain't over til it’s over
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh ohh ohh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, it ain't over til it’s over
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh ohh ohh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, it ain't over til it’s over

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
I smoke weed, you sip on lean
People always sayin’ what the hell does that mean
J is for the justice I did to the game
Lot of these niggas that's on is lame
A is for the way I airs 'em out
Coupes by the two’s I pairs 'em out
D's for the dope that a nigga still pumping
Twelve hour shifts got the spot still jumping
Rocking on til the block is gone
.38 is snubnosed but the chopper's long

[Verse 4: Mary J. Blige]
And everything takes time so they say
Ohh-ohh-whoa-ohh
What has been on my side everyday
Ohh-ohh-whoa-ohh
Every second gone is another way to come up
Bend the corner, crash into the jackpot
Twists and turns I can take

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
They can say, ayy, ooh, that my end is on the horizon
When I wake, ooh, all I see is the sun rising
Just when I thought I said all there was to say
I get the last word, it ain't over til it's over
Just when I thought I did all there was to do
I give my best to you, it ain't over til it’s over
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh ohh ohh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, it ain't over til it’s over
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh ohh ohh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, it ain't over til it’s over
We don’t get down like y'all
We don’t get down like y'all
Sucka nigga, we don’t get down like y'all

It’s been a lot of back and forth over this and that
Listen, pimpin’, let me tell you what the business is
Y’all and us I’mma tell you what the difference is
See, we old school, you just old news
We used to move blow, and you just blow dude
See we the talk of the town, me and my whole crew
You run around town, gossip like the hoes do
See you name-drop when nobody knows you
We get them lames out our section like we 'posed to
My crew, we cop the Bentley Brookland and the Roll too
You give her roses I’m the one she bring the rose to
So you say you’re shining, well I guess I’m shining more
So high up, I’m soaring, thirty and I’m like a dinosaur
Me to you like a comparing a vet to a cadet, nigga
Don’t call it a comeback
Again ride Benz from the fed pen
Pull up on them suckers, pop the trunk and tell ‘em get in
Thought I lost a step well guess again
I show you how to make a blessing out of bad breaks
Hoes want their clothes back, listen up fagbait
Them hot pants bad for your prostate
Lime green, hot pink, a drag queen hot date
At stores asking for the same size the bitches buy
They say it's hip, but where I'm from we call it sissyfied
Before us there were none, after us no more there'll ever be
This the greatest show on Earth you ever see
I still do it for my niggas in the streets, getting to it
Blowing money like my nigga, Big Meech used to do it
Say we’re blowing money fast, big old money bag
Three, four hundred cash just to make them suckers mad
Been the best since I was rapping in the rattle
As you comment on the rumors or what have you
Beware dude, prayer can’t prepare you, how dare you?
Disrespect my presence peasants, I will tear you
A new one, I poop on, your egos and move on
Rolls Royce back seat, no Grey Poupon
A true don, three piece cashmere suit on
Hear the truth on every song I spew on, Bloaw

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Slow down
Slow your role, junior
Slow down
Slow your role, junior

[Chorus]
Slow down, I can't take the heat
Slow down, it's wicked in these streets
Slow down, I can't take the heat
Slow down, it's wicked in these streets

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Life ain't nothing but a big old twist
A lot of times when I'm smoking, I'm doing that just to reminisce
It's funny, on how shit be
A lot of money, make y'all wanna come get me
But look here, I work hard for all the things I got
And to hang with a niggas just an intricate plot
You smoke my weed, you try to bang my hoes
And talk bad about a nigga, behind closed doors
But look here, dog, a ho once told me loc
Bite the hand that feeds you, and you'll wind up broke
Bitch niggas don't deserve to kick it
With rich niggas, nigga we seven figure niggas
And we bigger than the biggest hip hop, niggas of rap
And when we get to spittin', make sure y'all step back
You with that? Cause if you ain't clown
We from the D-O double G, we groupie true and slow down

[Chorus]
Slow down, I can't take the heat
Slow down, it's wicked in these streets
Slow down, I can't take the heat
Slow down, it's wicked in these streets

[Verse 2: Mia X]
Ayyo Snoop, I used to kick up dope, ride with niggas
Know about the hits, hang with killas
Take the broads down for jailhouse visits
Keep my bed warm with a cutthroat nigga
Have the card parties where the stakes was high
Go shopping, hit the club, and then start come by
I never had a day without no drama
Half the OG's age but they call me mama
Had the ganja overstuffed in the hefty bag
Orange peels to kill the smell slanging with my dad
I never thought about my life I swear y'all for real
Until my best friend Jill got killed
And then I, dropped to my knees and called on the Lord
Please change my ways cause I'm living too hard
And too foul, how I'm gon' raise a child
When I'm out here buck wild?
Damn I had to slow down

[Chorus]
Slow down, I can't take the heat
Slow down, it's wicked in these streets
Slow down, I can't take the heat
Slow down, it's wicked in these streets

[Verse 3: Mia X]
Yeah, I slow my roll down to a pimp strut
And started putting all this game on records
For my come up from sun up to sun down
I'm trying to get my money
Haters ain't gon' stop me cause haters can't run me
It's funny when a bitch was livin' foul
Everybody seemed glad but now they mad
Cause I'm flossing, boss ballin' guilt free
And feds can't take shit from me, so slow down

[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
I got niggas, shot niggas, drop niggas for fun
I swap from these shoulders, I don't need no gun
But it's the 90's and niggas don't bump by the end of the round
The clown bound to dump, young chump
You don't wanna get caught up in the mix
Cause I'm a soldier, blasting at the rollers, bitch
We don't, never ever, talk no shit
Unless we back that shit up, nigga you get lit

[Chorus]
Slow down, I can't take the heat
Slow down, it's wicked in these streets
Slow down, I can't take the heat
Slow down, it's wicked in these streets

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Slow down I can't take the heat
Slow your roll, tuck your heat and watch the haters
Slow down I can't take the heat
Slow your roll, tuck your heat and watch the haters

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, g-g-girl
I woke up before the light, thinking about tonight
I can't, I can't sleep
Just a few hours ago, we had the TV on
Drowning out your screams
Tell me your favorite love song, girl
I'm gonna play it while your toes curl
Girl, what you saying? Speak your mind
T-T-Tell-Tell me what you like

Baby, I'ma make you scream, yeah, I'm not finished yet (Yeah)

Gon' and whisper your wishes to me, babe
I'ma make you beg for it, beg for it
I'll give you what you need, only if you say please
I'ma make you beg for it, beg for it
Gon' and whisper your wishes to me, babe

[Verse 1]
Swagger in place, now let me get to it
I'm badder than your nigga and the niggas next to him
I do me, bitch, what are you doin'?
Teardrop Tune got you bitches boohooin'
Weezy F. Baby ga-ga-goo-gooin'
And girl, I swear, if you start chewin', I'm suin'
Ha ha, yeah, and to the paper I'm gluin'
And my trunk ain't big but big enough to fit you in
Have your people like "Where the hell you went?"
They find your ass with everything but movement
And money talks and I speak it fluent
And I keep them tools so don't be screwin' around
Uptown in this bitch like always
Young Money on the grind, no off-days
Young Money got cheese like Hog Heads
Now lay it down just like MJG and Ball said, yeah

[Bridge]
And I'm... I'm so hardbody
So... now I'm so hardbody

That's a big difference from what you're gon' do, yeah
Haha, spotlight on you, yeah, haha

[Verse 2]
My brother Marley G said, "You boys ain't shit
You can't name a bad bitch that the boy ain't with"
Same bad bitch that the boy came with
Same bad bitch that you boys can't get
I'll be goddamned if the Marl ain't hit
Take your girl and straight spoil that bitch
You know my niggas? Yeah, I give them all that bitch
Then drop her ass off and never call that bitch
Ya dig? My brother Mack Maine taught me that

Dude! How could you even want her back?
And just in case I forget my name, I made her get it on her back, yeah

[Hook]

Hollygrove animal—come on, try to tame me
Tell your ma I'm bad, and tell your grandma I'm dangerous
Tell your pa he pussy, tell your brother he a bitch
I'm "On your mark, set, go"-running this shit
I'm thuggin' this bitch on some rock-and-roll shit
Need Calamine lotion, see, my pockets swole, bitch
And they wonder why I sing and changed all my outfits?
'Cause all y'all rappers ain't talkin' 'bout shit

[Intro]
Okay
You say you never done this before
And that's cool and all
But I want you to try this with me
That's cool
Don't worry

[Chorus]
Get ready, pop it, let's go
Intergalactic you and me
Intergalactic you and me
Get ready, pop it, let's go
Intergalactic you and me
Intergalactic you and me

[Verse 1]
I once used to dream of peace until I found you
Once upon a time baby
I once used to dream so sweet until I had a taste of you
Once upon a time baby
Reachin' out to outer space, dancin' to awesome sounds
This all new to you
I'm reachin' out to hold you close so I don't slip away
Explore a new approach, a whole new free I'd say

[Chorus]
Get ready, pop it, let's go
Intergalactic you and me
Intergalactic you and me
Get ready, pop it, let's go
Intergalactic you and me
Intergalactic you and me
Get ready, pop it, let's go
Intergalactic you and me
Intergalactic you and me
Get ready, pop it, let's go
Intergalactic you and me
Intergalactic you and me

[Verse 2]
I know it's easy to imagine
But it's easier to just do
See, if you can't do what you imagine
Then what is imagination to you?
Just a waste of space in your brain
To take the place of hate or things all the same
Tell me your secrets, the things that make you tick
I like when you talk, because your voice is angelesque
Ay, I want to kiss you on your space below your navel at
The place that you keep neat, so moist, like a towelette
This will mark the day our minds and souls will connect
Let's not forget the sex, my heart you can collect, now, now
My heart you can collect, now, now
My heart you can collect, now, now
Have just one more cap, babe, babe, babe
Have just one more stem, babe

[Chorus]
Get ready, pop it, let's go
Intergalactic you and me
Intergalactic you and me
Get ready, pop it, let's go
Intergalactic you and me
Intergalactic you and me

[Bridge]
Pop it, ready, go
Let it, take, take, take, take over
Get ready, pop it, let's go
Get ready, let, let, it take you over
Get ready, pop it, let's go
Take it, just let it, take, take, you over
Get ready, let's go, let's go, hey

[Chorus]
Get ready, pop it, let's go
Intergalactic you and me
Intergalactic you and me
Get ready, pop it, let's go
Intergalactic you and me
Intergalactic you and me
Get ready, pop it, let's go
Intergalactic you and me
Intergalactic you and me
Get ready, pop it, let's go
Intergalactic you and me
Intergalactic you and me

[Narration: Common]
Soon after falling into a deeper psychedelic state
To escape the prison of our reality
Our hero becomes trapped in his own peaceful place
Which immediately becomes his sanctuary
A place filled with his wildest dreams
This is his new home

[Verse 1]
Topless models doing semaphore
Wave their flags as she walks by and get ignored
Illuminations on a rainy day
When she walks, her footsteps sing a reckless serenade

[Chorus]
I've been trying to figure out exactly what it is I need
Called up to listen to the voice of reason
And got the answering machine

[Verse 2]
The type of kisses where teeth collide
When she laughs, the heavens hum a stun gun lullaby
Those twinkling vixens with the shining spiral eyes
Their hypnosis goes unnoticed when she's walking by

[Chorus]
I've been trying to figure out exactly what it is I need
Called up to listen to the voice of reason
And got his answering machine

[Bridge]
I left my message, but did he fuck get back to me
And now I'm stuck still wondering how it's meant to be

[Outro]
Singing a reckless serenade, reckless serenade
Reckless serenade, reckless serenade
Reckless serenade, reckless serenade
Reckless serenade

[Chorus]
She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front, up against the wall
She's thunderstorms

[Verse 1]
I've been feeling foolish, you should try it
She came and substituted the peace and quiet for
Acrobatic blood flow concertina
Cheating heart beat, rapid fire

[Chorus]
She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front, up against the wall
She's thunderstorms
Here is your host, sounds as if she's pretty close
When the heat starts growing horns
She's thunderstorms

[Verse 2]
She's been loop-the-looping around my mind
Her motorcycle boots give me this kind of
Acrobatic blood concertina
Cheating heart beat, rapid fire

[Chorus]
She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front, up against the wall
She's thunderstorms

[Bridge]
In an unusual place, when you're feeling far away
She does what the night does to the day

[Chorus]
She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front, up against the wall
She's thunderstorms
Thunderstorms
Thunderstorms

[Verse 1]
Your love is like a studded leather headlock
Your kiss, it could put creases in the rain
You're rarer than a can of dandelion and burdock
And those other girls are just post-mix lemonade

[Chorus]
Suck it and see, you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
Be cruel to me 'cause I am a fool for you

[Verse 2]
I poured my aching heart into a pop song
I couldn't get the hang of poetry
That's not a skirt, girl, that's a sawn-off shotgun
And I can only hope you've got it aimed at me

[Chorus]
Suck it and see, you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
Be cruel to me 'cause I am a fool for

[Bridge]
Blue moon girls from once upon a Shangri-La
How I often wonder where you are
You have got that face that just says
"Baby, I was made to break your heart", oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
Suck it and see, you never know
Sit next to me before I go, go, go, go
Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
Be cruel to me 'cause I am a fool for you

[Verse 1]
Caricatures of your wrecking ball gown
In my mind all the time
I wanna be in that damsel patterned alley
Where you go for a smoke
And sorrow slow dances
The phones are lighting up
Taking no chances
Close but never close enough

[Chorus]
Been watching cowboy films
On gloomy afternoons
Tinting the solitude
Put on your dancing shoes
And show me what to do
I know you've got the moves

[Verse 2]
All my own stunts, high noon has changed its tune
Linking arms, sinking hearts
And sorrow slow dances
Around the edges of her eyes
Taking no chances
The last one out to win a prize

[Chorus]
Been watching cowboy films
On gloomy afternoons
Tinting the solitude
Put on your dancing shoes
And show me what to do
I know you've got the moves

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro: "I'm From High Green" snippet]
I'm from High Green
I'm from High Green

[Verse 1]
Just when things are getting complicated
In the eye of the storm
She flicks a red-hot revelation
Off the tip of her tongue
It does a dozen somersaults
And leaves you supercharged
Makes me wanna blow the candles out
Just to see if you glow in the dark

[Chorus]
Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala

[Verse 2]
Home sweet home, home sweet home
Home sweet booby-trap
I took the batteries out my mysticism
And put 'em in my thinking cap
She's got a telescopic hallelujah
Hanging up on her wall
For when it gets too complicated
In the eye of the storm

[Chorus]
Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala
Oh, oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
And in a hellcat spangled cavern
When your judgement's on the run
And you're acting like a stranger
'Cause you thought it looked like fun
And did you ever get the feeling
That these are things she's said before?
Her steady hands may well have done the devil's pedicure
What you waiting for?
Sing another fucking shalalala

[Outro]
Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala

[Intro]
Don't judge me

[Verse 1]
I know this girl, she a real good girl and she be low-key
Looking like a star with a real nice car, a Mercedes key
And she got a nigga and she love this nigga, well, at least I think
Every time we bark, she pay us no mind in the middle of the street
She be like

[Chorus]
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas, I'll ride for my nigga
I'll die for my nigga, fuck them other—

[Verse 2]
Until one day, he wasn't acting right
In the middle of the night, she checked his phone, Erica, right?
When he pled the Fifth, man, it was on, matter fact, she gone
Matter fact, Tyrone was on speed dial, so when she got home
It was going down, she go

[Chorus]
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Sick of lies from her nigga, fuck that other—

[Verse 3]
I know this girl, she a real hood girl, and she with the shit
Keep her hair tied up, big bamboos, Mike Jordan kicks
With that big butt, but when I try to holla, she gon' resist
In her man, she trust, so when I walk by her, she be screaming this
She be like

[Chorus]
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas, I'll ride for my nigga
I'll die for my nigga, fuck them other—

[Verse 4]
Until one day, he wasn't acting right
In the middle of the night, she checked his pockets, found condoms by
Magnum, and the moment they was acknowledged, she popped his eye
Then ran outside, then started drivin' on the passenger side
Homeboy was smiling, she gon'

[Chorus]
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Sick of lies from her nigga, fuck that other—

[Verse 5]
And so these girls, these vulnerable girls
Took they men up, put 'em in they world, they vulnerable world
And just like that, it was only gettin', got they feelings hurt
Tell me how that sound? They got fed up with the biggest question mark
They curious now
'Cause when women get sick of men, they think of a big helping hand
To lend each other, uncover emotions when lights dim
So when she telling her to come over, it'll be alright
The minute she hit the block and turn left, she'll be turning dyke, they go

[Chorus]
Fuck with other bitches when they tired of these niggas
Fuck with other bitches when they tired of these niggas
Fuck with other bitches on the side 'cause these niggas—

[Outro]
Tammy's song

[Verse 1]
Do you still feel younger than you thought you would by now
Or darling, have you started feeling old yet?
Don't worry, I'm sure that you're still breaking hearts
With the efficiency that only youth can harness

And do you still think love is a laserquest
Or do you take it all more seriously?
I've tried to ask you this in some daydreams that I've had
But you're always busy being make-believe

[Chorus]
And do you look into the mirror to remind yourself you're there
Or have somebody's goodnight kisses got that covered?
When I'm not being honest
I pretend that you were just some lover

[Verse 2]
Now I can't think of there without thinking of you
I doubt that comes as a surprise
And I can't think of anything to dream about
I can't find anywhere to hide

[Chorus]
And when I'm hanging on by the rings around my eyes
And I convince myself I need another
And for a minute, it gets easier
To pretend that you were just some lover

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
When I'm pipe and slippers and rocking chair
Singing dreadful songs about summer
Will I have found a better method of
Pretending you were just some lover?
Will I have found a better method of
Pretending you were just some lover?

[Intro]
I'm in a vest

[Verse 1]
Library pictures of the quickening canoe
The first of its kind to get to the moon
Trust some ellipses to chase you 'round the room
Through curly straws and metaphors and goo

[Verse 2]
Been watching all the neon blossom flickering
You look as if you've all forgotten where you've been
Going riding through the thunder suckle fuzz canyon
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one

[Verse 3]
Library pictures of the quickening canoe
The first of its kind to get to the moon
Give me an eeny, meeny, miny, moe
Or an ip, dip, dog shit rock and roll

[Verse 1]
Break a mirror, roll the dice
Run with scissors through a chip pan fire fight
Go into business with a grizzly bear
But just don't sit down 'cause I've moved your chair

[Verse 2]
Find a well-known hard man and start a fight
Wear your shell suit on bonfire night
Fill in a circular hole with a peg that's square
But just don't sit down 'cause I've moved your chair

[Chorus]
Oooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oooh, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
Bite the lightning and tell me how it tastes
Kung fu fighting on your roller skates
Do the Macarena in the devil's lair
But just don't sit down 'cause I've moved your chair

[Chorus]
Oooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oooh

[Chorus]
Ridin' with them boys and girls and we're high
All we want to do is have a good time
Young, wild, and reckless is how we live life
Pray that we make it to twenty-one (One, one, one, one)
Oh, oh, we make it to twenty-one (One, one, one, one, one, one, one)
Ridin' with them boys and girls and we're high
All we want to do is have a good time
Young, wild, and reckless is how we live life
Pray that we make it to twenty-one (One, one, one, one)
Oh, oh, we make it to twenty-one (One, one, one, one, one, one, one)

[Interlude]
I'm glad we was able to talk about her vice and her evils
There is an even more important topic I'd like to discuss
The dysfunctional bastards of the Ronald Reagan era
Young men that learned to do everything spiteful
This is your generation
Live fast and die young
Who's willing to explain this story?

[Chorus]
Ridin' with them boys and girls and we're high
All we want to do is have a good time
Young, wild, and reckless is how we live life
Pray that we make it to twenty-one (One, one, one, one)
Oh, oh, we make it to twenty-one (One, one, one, one, one, one, one)
Ridin' with them boys and girls and we're high
All we want to do is have a good time
Young, wild, and reckless is how we live life
Pray that we make it to twenty-one (One, one)

[JORMA]: Hey

[AKIVA]: Hey. What's wrong?

[JORMA]: Come quick. Some losers want to fight us

[AKIVA]: Oh. Not again. I'll go get my gun

[JORMA]: Okay

[Chorus: Jorma & Akiva]
You must be loco to mess with us
Don't you know we're dangerous?
We'll kill you
We'll kill you

[Verse 1: Akiva, Jorma & Both]
It's on now; the fight's beginning
One punch in and we're already winning
Guy #1, the ape-shit killer
After you're dead, I drink an ice-cold Miller
Out on parole and I'm looking to score
I'm Guy #2, I'll take your whore
AKs, Uzis, nines and Glocks
One pierced ear and ankle socks
If you see us on the street, you can bet we're high
We wear sunglasses for blood-shot eyes
Each jerk we kill, our hearts grow colder
I could shoot all day, doesn't hurt my shoulder
I drive all the time, it's no big deal
Open the door and get behind the wheel
I only hang with felons, killers, and thugs
You're still a cunt, Steve; go fuck your snake

[Chorus: Akiva & Jorma]
You must be loco to mess with us
Don't you know we're dangerous?
We'll kill you
We'll kill you

[Bridge: Akiva & Jorma]
Our thirst for blood
Is never enough
Is there a heaven
For gangsters like us?

[Verse 2: Akiva, Jorma, & Both]
Hey, Guy #1? Yeah, Guy #2?
I'm just doing me! I'm doing you too! (No!)
I only date girls who have been around
I know what they like, I'll go downtown
We play dominoes, but call them bones
And wear cool hats like Al Capone
Who cares about the pigs? We can pay the bail
You're just a loser; you'd get raped in jail
We're just two guys who have a death wish
Screw tried by twelve, we'll be carried by six, like:
Bowm, bowm
Bowm bowm bowm bowm-bowm

[Chorus: Akiva & Jorma]
You must be loco to mess with us
Don't you know we're dangerous?
We'll kill you
We'll kill you

[Outro: Jorma]
Ain't no such thing as half-way crooks
You're scared of death, you're scared to look; you're shook

[Intro]

[Chorus]
And it goes young, young, young, young, young

[Verse 2]
Bust that pussy open, then I tell her bring it back
Make sure you don't fall in love, cause I don't have the time for that
Only thing I chase is money, if you tell me where it's at
When you rich, there is a certain type of woman you attract
I say I be on some G shit, I be on some G shit
Check them other niggas for that Louis shopping spree shit
Not me bitch, I said not me bitch

[Chorus]
And it goes young, young, young, young, young

[Outro]

Their panties hit the ground every time I give 'em shots
So cups in the air, everybody let's take shots

If you feeling drunk, put your hands in the air
And if you trying to fuck put ya hands in the air

[Verse 4: LMFAO]

You ready?
Here I go!
October's very own
Drizzy
Taz You ain't even got nothin to worry about man
Check
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Are you listening?
Is anybody listening?
Walk into a room and you can smell the Clive Cristian scent
A lot of niggas is threatened by my positioning
Thrillin bars you think I'm writing with John Ghrisam
Pen
I need Rose, nevermind the pricing
Know we brought cake to the party, no icing
No ice on, big Phantom no license
Fuck if you're feelin me as long as your wife is
No one in my city gotta pocket like Drizzy
I can rock fitted Jeans cause my credit card skinny
It's pitch black and covers all incidentials
And Ms. Rhone sorry you ain't notice my potential
Fuck ya rappers and your self-proclaimed status
I can only see green now happy St.Patty's
I know you waitin on a last quote
Check the soundscan and you can see that I'm the last hope

[Verse 2]
By the way I'm Jewish and turnin 22
Get's depressing when you see your favorite rappers
Goin through it
Tryna re-invent themselves, showin' no improvement
Gettin' crushed by this light skinned young'n on some
New shit
40 just recorded and who dropped this here
Cos I'm tryna fuck Megan Fox this year
And if you got a stylist to cop you gear
And you are in my age bracket, you are not my peer
Fuck you really know about a Eames couch
Frette sheets, perfect touch to a clean house
Wide awake, but a nigga's livin' ya dreams out
Lookin like a photoshoot everytime the team's out
And is the realest nigga still I
A woman could love me to death but I'd still die
So I'm about us now
Smith and Wesson flow
You should tell them boys duck down

[Skit]
Gather 'round
I'm glad everybody came out tonight
As we stand on our neighborhood corner
Know that this fire that's burning represents the passion you have
Listen
Keisha, Tammy, come up front
I recognize all of you
Every creed and color
With that being said
Fuck your ethnicity
You understand that?
We gon' talk about a lot of shit that concerns you, all of you

[Intro: Alori Joh]
Now everybody, throw your hands up high
If you don't give a fuck, throw your hands up high
Throw your hands up high

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Now, I don't give a fuck if you
Black, white, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit
That don't mean shit to me
Fuck your ethnicity, nigga

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Fire burning inside my eyes, this the music that saved my life
Y'all be calling it hip-hop, I be calling it hypnotize
Yeah, hypnotize, trapped my body, but freed my mind
What the fuck are you fighting for? Ain't nobody gon' win that war
My details be retail, man, I got so much in store
Racism is still alive, yellow tape and colored lines
Fuck that, nigga, look at that line, it's so diverse
They gettin' off work and they wanna see Kendrick
Everybody can't drive Benzes, and I been there, so I make it my business
To give 'em my full attention, ten-hut, man, I gotta get my wind up
Man, I gotta get down with God 'cause I got my sins up, ooh
Matter fact, don't mistake me for no fuckin' rapper
They sit backstage and hide behind them fuckin' cameras
I mosh pit, had a microphone and I tossed it
Had a brain, then I lost it
I'm out of my mind, so don't you mind how much the cost is
Penny for my thoughts, everybody, please hold up your wallets
Yeah, man, I'm the mailman, can't you tell, man?
Gone postal, never freeze up when I approach you
That's starstruck and roast you, oh my
HiiiPower

[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar]
Reporting live from Planet Terminator X
I saw Martin Luther King with an AK-47

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Now, I don't give a fuck if you
Black, white, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit
That don't mean shit to me
Fuck your ethnicity, nigga

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm tired of y'all, 'cause everybody lied to y'all
And you believe it? Recognize them false achievements
It's treason and I'm Tylenol, I knock out when you knock it off
Knock on the doors of opportunity, I'm too involved
I'm no activist, I'm no Einstein
Before calculus, I was kicking that math
Dropping that science like an alchemist and I be kicking that ass
Lyrically, I'm UFC
If a UFO had came for me, I'ma come back with the head of an alien
Don't alienate my dreams
Get it right, get a life, I got two
That's a metaphor for the big shit I do
Boy, TMI, TSA, man, I'm fly
Put wings on my back
That a plane or an angel? Both
Like a pilot with a halo, woah
Gross

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
I mean, I've seen so many things come through them, him, her, you, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
I'm just a messenger
Yeah, I know life's a bitch, get the best of her
Put them threes up, they notice that we up
HiiiPower and the power in the people and if they don't believe us
They'll die
Wizard

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Now, I don't give a fuck if you
Black, white, Asian, Hispanic, goddammit
That don't mean shit to me
Fuck your ethnicity, nigga

[Intro]
Alright, here we go, third take
Real quick, Ali
Mmm

[Chorus]
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson with madness
Now just imagine the magic I light to asses
Don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead), yes, sir (Amen), church
(He dead), I killed him (Amen), bitch

[Verse 1]
And this is rigor mortis and it's gorgeous when you die
Ali recorded and I'm Morpheus, the matrix of my mind
I'm out the orbit, you an orphan and a hairdresser combined
I'm on the toilet when I rhyme, if you the shit, then I decline
I climax where you begin and then I end on cloud nine
And that's important when you morph into an angel in the sky
And don't be forging all my signatures, my listeners reply
And tell me that you biting style, you got a hell of an appetite
And I'ma be here for a while, just buckle up before the ride
Or knuckle up if you can fight, we always making 'em duck or die
A suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide
CSI just might investigate this fucking parasite
(He dead, amen)
That's what they telling me
Aim it at your celebrity, this is studio felony
Ferragami so many and cool enough for the '70s
Nigga, payback's a bitch, and bitch, you been livin' in debt with me
Dead 'em all and especially
Leave a call on his mother voicemail that say that he rest in peace
Bigger chopper the recipe
Wrestling? That's irrelevant, rather rest at your residence
Whistling to the melody, couldn't think of a better D
Better be on your P and Q, it's just me, Jay Rock, Soul, and Q
Solar system and barbecue, nothing else you can do

[Chorus]
(He dead), yup-yup (Amen), I killed him
(He dead, amen), amen
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead), yup-yup (Amen), I know
(He dead), for sure (Amen), amen
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper

[Verse 2]
I wrapped him and made him Casper, I capture the likes of NASA
My pedigree to fly past ya, I'll pass the weed to the pastor
We all are sinners, won't you send us to Bible study faster?
Your hypocritist reaction a blasphemy, I assassin my casualty
And it's casually done, and tell 'em my salary come
In lump sum one hundreds, don't talk to me 'bout no money
The sun is under my feet, and I come in peace to compete
I don't run if you'd rather leap, my statistics go up in weeks
And I go visit the nearest creek, and I get busy on many MC
Really ballistic, anybody can see
Any assistance, everybody deceased
Some persistence, recognize I be
Really too vicious, the permanent beast
And the demolition breaking up the street
Better partition, better dot your T
And I gon' mention how the far you see
Putting my dick in the rap industry
Everybody bitching, getting mad at me
Recognize Kendrick in the battery
And I'm charged up, and the catastrophe
Is charged up, and the audacity
Of y'all fucks never could hassle me
And y'all luck just ran out, you'll see

[Chorus]
(He dead), yup-yup (Amen), I know
(He dead), for sure (Amen), amen
Got me breathing with dragons
I'll crack the egg in your basket, you bastard
I'm Marilyn Manson, don't ask for your favorite rapper
(He dead), yup-yup (Amen), I know
(He dead), for sure (Amen), amen

[Chorus: Colin Munroe]
I love the way you put it on your eyes
The roses on your face light up the sky
Those lips are colorful all of the time
And girl, that's fine, but I wanna know, do you mind?
No makeup today, no makeup today, today
No makeup today, no makeup today
And girl, that's fine, but I wanna know, do you mind?

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I know she 'bout to ask me how she look
I tell her beautiful and how long it took
For you to put it on, it was early in the morn'
She resembled a model out of a MAC book
Concentrating on the way the eyeliner thickens
I stand behind her and try to figure her vision
Of prettiness, the wittiness of colors on her skin tone
Her complexion in a direction I've outgrown
Damn girl, why so much?
You 'bout to blow your cover when you cover up
Don't you know your imperfections is a wonderful blessing?
From Heaven is where you got it from
I love your smile, you can do it without style
From your lips all the way to your eyebrows
It's the beauty in her, but when the makeup occur
I don't see it, all I see is a blur

[Chorus: Colin Munroe]
I love the way you put it on your eyes
The roses on your face light up the sky
Those lips are colorful all of the time
And girl, that's fine, but I wanna know, do you mind?
No makeup today, no makeup today, today
No makeup today, no makeup today
And girl, that's fine, but I wanna know, do you mind?

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar & Alori Joh]
I know she 'bout to ask me how she look
I tell her beautiful and how long it took
For you to put it on, it was early in the morn'
She resembled a model out of a MAC book
Concentrating on the way my eyeliner thickens
He stand behind me and try to figure her vision
Of prettiness, the wittiness of colors on my skin tone
My complexion in a direction I've outgrown
I feel like it's not enough
I can never put on too much makeup
Yeah, I know your imperfections, I be constantly stressing
From him is where I get it from, they tell me I need to
Smile at least once in a while
I hate my lips, my nose, my eyebrows
It's the beauty in me, but what he don't see
Is that I had a black eye— to be continued, eleven

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Ladies and gentlemen
And you ain't gotta get drunk to have fun
You ain't gotta get drunk to have fun
And you ain't gotta get drunk to have fun
You ain't gotta get drunk to have fun

[Chorus: Colin Munroe]
I love the way you put it on your eyes
The roses on your face light up the sky
Those lips are colorful all of the time
And girl, that's fine, but I wanna know, do you mind?
No makeup today, no makeup today, today
No makeup today, no makeup today
And girl, that's fine, but I wanna know, do you mind?

[Chorus: Ash Riser]
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, and Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
She take the little change she make to fix her nail cuticles
Lipstick is suitable to make you fiend for more
She play Mr. Shakur, that's her favorite rapper
Bumpin' "Brenda's Got a Baby" while a pervert yellin' at her
And she capture features of a woman, but only seventeen
Then seven cars start honking
She start running like Flo-Jo, don't care if they Joe Blow
If they got money to blow, a blow job is a sure go
And sure enough, don't see a dime of dirty dollars
Just give it all to her daddy, but she don't know her father
That's ironic
See, a block away from Lueders Park, I seen an El Camino parked
And in her heart, she hate it there, but in her mind, she made it where
Nothin' really matters, so she hit the back seat
Rosa Parks never a factor when she makin' ends meet

[Chorus: Ash Riser]
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
Her anatomy is God's temple
And it's quite simple, her castle is 'bout to be destroyed
She's always paranoid, watching the law inside the streets
Undercovers, the dummies that look like decoys
Remember sergeant let her slide
Said if he seen what's between her thighs, he'd compromise
To no surprise
She took the ultimatum 'round the alleyway and gave him
A warm welcome, then felt him right below the navel
Though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
His eyes was closed shut, prior charges, he had waived 'em
It was a block away from Lueders Park, I seen a squad car parked
And in her heart, she hate it there, but in her mind, she made it where
Nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
'Cause Rosa Parks never a factor when she toppin' off police

[Chorus: Ash Riser]
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
As she bust down like a twelve-bunk on tour
She suddenly realize she'll never escape the allure
Of a Black man, white man needing satisfaction
At first, it became a practice, but now she's numb to it
Sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it
But she never heard of Catholic religion or sinner's redemption, that sounds foolish
And you can blame it on her mother
For letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
Ten months before she was ten, he moved in and that's when he touched her
This motherfucker is the fuckin' reason why Keisha rushing to that
Block away from Lueders Park, I seen an El Camino parked
And in her heart, she hate it there, but in her mind, she made it where
Nothing really matters, still she hit the back seat
Then caught a knife inside the bladder, left for dead, raped in the street
Keisha's song, mmm
My little sister eleven, I looked her right in the face
The day that I wrote this song, sat her down and pressed play

[Chorus: Ash Riser]
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
Flagging down all of these flashy cars
Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard, oh
Flagging down all of these flashy cars

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh-uh, fuck that

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
Twelve bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Man, I swear my nigga trippin' off that shit again
Pick him up, then I set him in cold water
Then I order someone to bring him Vicodin
Hope that take the pain away
From the feelin' that he feel today
You know when you part of Section.80
You feel like no one can relate
'Cause you are, you are, a loner, loner
Marijuana endorphins make you stronger, stronger
I'm in the house party trippin' off
My generation sippin' cough syrup like it's water
Never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man, not one of our lives is caught up
In the daily superstition that the world is 'bout to end
Who gives a fuck? We never do listen
'Less it comes with an 808 (A melody and some hoes)
PlayStation and some drank (Technology bought my soul)
Lookin' around and all I see is a big crowd that's product of me
And they probably relatives relevant for a rebel's dream
Yep, her president is Black, she Black too
Purple Label on her back, but that tab is light blue
She take it straight to the head, then she look at me
She got ADHD

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
Twelve bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist

[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Like woah-woah, woah, woah-woah, woah (Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Woah-woah, woah, woah-woah, woah (Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
(They always told me ADHD did it)
Woah, woah-woah

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
And then she started
And then she started feelin' herself like no one else in this apartment
"Beg your pardon? Oh, I rap, baby, how old are you?"
She say twenty-two, I say twenty-three, "Okay, then we are crack babies," damn
"Why you say that?" She said, "Where my drink at?"
"I'ma tell you later, just tell your neighbors and the police relax"
I stood up, shut the blind, closed the screen, Jumbotron
Made to the back where she reside, then she said, "Read between the lines," yep
Hope that I get close enough when the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up when the Nuvo start to drown
Her body, and I know the both of us really deep in the mood now
It's nothin' we can do now, somebody walked in with a pound (Woah)
Of that Bay Area kush, she looked at me, then looked
At it, then she grabbed it, then she said, "Get it understood"
"You know why we crack babies? Because we born in the '80s
The ADHD crazy"

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
Twelve bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist

[Post-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Like woah-woah, woah, woah-woah, woah (Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
Woah-woah, woah, woah-woah, woah (Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
(They always told me ADHD did it)
Woah, woah-woah

[Outro: Ab-Soul]
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light
Double cup, deuce, four, six, just mix it in Sprite
Ecstasy, 'shrooms, blow, 'dro, hoes, whatever you like
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Check, check, check, check, check

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
It go ride to it, ride to it, 'cause you never know
When a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it
Die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right
Be different, do different things
Don't do it like he did, 'cause he ain't what you is
But we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
To the meaning of life, what's my purpose?
Maybe this Earth is ain't a good place to be
How far is heaven? Let's see
Is it in the clouds like they said it would be?
I wonder when I die will he give me receipts?
I wonder will the eyes of the Lord look at me?
Look at me, look at me, I'm a loser, I'm a winner
I'm good, I'm bad, I'm a Christian, I'm a sinner
I'm humble, I'm loud, I'm righteous, I'm a killer
What I'm doing? I'm saying that I'm human, now people just

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Ride to it, ride to it, 'cause you never know
When a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it
Die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right
Be different, do different things
Don't do it like he did, 'cause he ain't what you is
But we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
It go one (One), two (Two), three (Three)
Two in the front, one in the back seat (Seat)
Seat (Seat), seat (Seat), seat (Seat)
Looking for a victim of a AK-47, hundred-round each, each, each
But why must we retaliate? Is it human nature?
I don't know, I look for the answers later
"Make a right, there they go" (There they go)
Sometimes gotta

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Ride to it, ride to it, 'cause you never know
When a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it
Die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right
Be different, do different things
Don't do it like he did, 'cause he ain't what you is
But we can win-win, wait, let's get straight to the point

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
As I open this book and then burn up some of this reefer
My plan is to figure out the world and escape all my demons
I'm dying inside, I wonder if Zion inside the heavens
A condom, a Rollie, pain, a fat blunt and a MAC-11
That's all I see in my life and they tell me to make it right
But I'm right on the edge of Everest and I might jump tonight
Have you ever had known a saint that was taking sinner's advice?
Well it's probably you, am I right? If I'm wrong, you a fucking liar
When I lie on my back and look at the ceiling, it's so appealing to pray
I wonder if I'm just a villain, dealing my morals away
Some people look at my face then tell me don't worry 'bout it
I give 'em back they deposit, no money, just total silence
I'm running, they say I'm wildin', a youngin' with lack of guidance
That's hundreds of us with problems
Mo' money, mo' drugs and violence
Look at the soul of an out-of-control artist
That's dealing with life the hardest, that's on my life
But regardless I'ma—

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & BJ the Chicago Kid]
Ride to it, ride to it, 'cause I never know
When a bullet might hit me and I die to it, die to it
Die to it, die to it, live my life, live it right
Be different, do different things
Don't do it like he did, 'cause he ain't what I is
But we can win, wait, let's get straight to the point
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Hmm

[Verse 4: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Yeah, life can please ya, but death can tease ya
On the day Niko had that seizure
I lost one of my biggest believers, aww
Close deaths make you think about your life
Like if I had that same chance twice, what would I do different?
I'd tell her I loved her more, do more
But tease her 'bout crying on that picture
Now when I'm done recording
Swear, I let the beat bang in her name
Make her shake her head in heaven, saying, "They at it again"
Make them clouds turn to speakers
Don't take too much smoke from the reefer
Love being in the room with her peoples
Now my love life murking it, family having surgeries
Hate it that the truth that chose for they life to be under me
Lord, what kind of life is this?
Momma, I just wanna sing
Momma said, "According to get everything" (Uh)
"You gotta risk everything"
So I'm smoking my kush, reading Corinthians
Smoking my kush, reading Corinthians
Smoking my kush, reading Corinthians (Corinthians)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Smoking my kush, reading Corinthians (Corinthians, corinthians, corinthians)

[Outro: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Mm, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Da, da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da, da
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Da, da, da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da-da-da

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Smoking out, pouring up, keep that lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck
Everybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall, I can't fuck with y'all
Pussy-ass, ho niggas (Niggas), I can't fuck with y'all
Bitches all up in my business (Business), I can't fuck with y'all
Industry of counterfeits (Counterfeits), I can't fuck with y'all

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Taking off when you landing
Bitch niggas gonna throw tantrums
And I'm dancing on them stars
The galaxy ain't got room for y'all
Ain't nothing gonna happen soon for y'all
While I'm here and every day I hear
Your bullshit, self-pity
Reason why you never dealt with me
Reason why your girl dealt with me
Hands up, in the building, we get busy and say

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P., yep
R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P., yep
That's exactly what this sound like
A to the A to the L-I-Y-A-H, give it up two times
Then give it right back, don't blow my high

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Smoking out, pouring up, keep that lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck
Everybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall, I can't fuck with y'all
Pussy-ass, ho niggas (Niggas), I can't fuck with y'all
Bitches all up in my business (Business), I can't fuck with y'all
Industry of counterfeits (Counterfeits), I can't fuck with y'all

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Look at my life then look at yours
Get some ambition, why you bored?
Time'll never wait on no man
Society will never hold your hand
Niggas like to gossip like bitches
Got me thinking you don't like bitches
Wonder what's behind them Ray Bans?
Eyes of a coward, I understand
Niggas like to gossip like bitches
Sip Dom Pérignon, when we finish, we say

[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P., yep
R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P., yep
That's exactly what this sound like
But never will I ever forget Left Eye
Roll up, put a ribbon in the sky
And a button on your lips, don't blow my high

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Smoking out, pouring up, keep that lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck
Everybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall, I can't fuck with y'all
Pussy-ass, ho niggas (Niggas), I can't fuck with y'all
Bitches all up in my business (Business), I can't fuck with y'all
Industry of counterfeits (Counterfeits), I can't fuck with y'all

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar & Aaliyah]
Now everybody sing this shit
I'm sending him a four-page letter
And I enclosed it with a kiss (A kiss)
And when I write him, he better
Get it on time
Look at my life, and look at yours
Get some ambition why you bored

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P
R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P
R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P
R.I.P. Aaliyah, R.I.P

[Pre-Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I know a lot of people that smile in my face
But talk behind my back every time I'm gone
So when they call my number, I don't never pick up
I don't owe you shit, bitch, leave me alone
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Too many niggas, not enough hoes
And some of you niggas, acting like hoes
Stay to myself like loners do
Get high by myself, I'm not in the mood
To politic or be fake with you
We apologize if you ever knew
Too many niggas, and not enough hoes
And most of you niggas, acting like hoes

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Everything I do is too alumni
I'ma take my time, I'ma master it
You should be mindful of a mastermind
Put a landmine right where your momma live
Now blow up, blow up, hold up, I ain't seen your kind before
See me as a dollar sign 'til I resign or you report
That I done you wrong, and I mean you know my home endeavors
Nigga right now, it's now or never
Nigga right now, I'm high as ever, but however...

[Pre-Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I know a lot of people that smile in my face
But talk behind my back every time I'm gone
So when they call my number, I don't never pick up

I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Everybody heard that I fuck with Dre
And they wanna tell me, I made it
Nigga I ain't made shit, if he gave me a handout
I'ma take his wrist and break it
Nigga, I'm faded off of that Nuvo, chilling with two hoes in here
And they tie my laces, living the Matrix as them pills disappear
Me and my niggas just acting bad HiiiPower conglomerate
Living that life and counting this cash old friends I no longer have

[Pre-Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I know a lot of people that smile in my face
But talk behind my back every time I'm gone
So when they call my number, I don't never pick up
I don't owe you shit, bitch, leave me alone
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Too many niggas, not enough hoes
And some of you niggas, acting like hoes

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q & Kendrick Lamar]
I remember when I came out and shit
Man, it's been so long since they see my dick
Probably been five months since I seen my seed
Goddammit, K. Dot, when it come to this?
When I was sleeping on couches
Nigga couldn't get a call, just a Glock for my vouch
Nigga I was mothafuckin' out, yeah
With the flashing lights had me stuck like reindeer
When I should have been making bank, yeah
I was somewhere stuck where the flame is
Mothafucka, see how far that I came here
Went broke and I came up in the same year, can I get a hell yeah?
Drop my tear, hold my joy, show my pride
Music saved my fucking life, I'm doing right and you left behind
Feel my pain, now I'm styling, Hermès shit, I spent a thousand
Different homes, different islands
Dropped my mixtape and it sold like an album

[Pre-Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar & ScHoolboy Q]
Reason why I'm be going big, bitch, suck my dick
Yeah, I'm going big, bitch, suck my dick
Tell 'em I'm going big, bitch, suck my dick
Yeah, I'm going big, bitch, suck my dick (Yeah)

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Too many niggas, not enough hoes
And some of you niggas, acting like hoes
Stay to myself like loners do
Get high by myself, I'm not in the mood
To politic or be fake with you
We apologize if you ever knew
Too many niggas, and not enough hoes
And most of you niggas, acting like hoes

[Outro: Alori Joh]
Like hoes, like hoes, like hoes, like hoes
Like hoes, nigga actin like a hoe
Like hoes, like hoes, like hoes
You actin like a hoe, you actin like a hoe
You actin like a hoe, niggas actin like a hoe
Like hoes, like hoes, like hoes, like hoes

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I used to want to see the penitentiary way after elementary
Thought it was cool to look the judge in the face when he sentenced me
Since my uncles was institutionalized
My intuition had said I was suited for family ties
My mama is stressin', my daddy tired
I need me a weapon, these niggas ride
Every minute, hour, and second, ministers tried to save me
How I'm gon' listen when I don't even hear God?
Heaven or hell, base it all on my instincts
My hands dirty, you worried 'bout mud in your sink
You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
The same nigga that kill with you'll squeal with you
I deal with you like my son, stare at the sun
And you'll be looking in my eyes, homie
Stand for something or fall for anything
And you working with two left feet at the skating rink
But anyway, this for my niggas
Uncles, twenty-three hours, sendin' me pictures
I want you to know that I'm so determined to blow
That you hear the music I wrote, hope it get you off death row
You came home to a pocket full of stones
A Metro PC phone, then you went back in
So when I touch the pen, the pen is in my view
I'ma get it right, just so you

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good

[Refrain: GLC]
And I do this for the city
Got some Hennessy and my real niggas with me
Fuck the police, they gon' have to come and get me
If it feel good to you, holler if you hear me

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
The same nigga that kill with you'll squeal with you
I like to start it out from the bottom and build with you
Be on my last dollar and split the bill with you
I'm twenty-three with morals and plans of living cordial
Not rich, but wealthy, there's nothing you can tell me
My killings are not remorseful
The city got my back, and for that, I give them my torso
You think about it and don't call me lyrical
'Cause really I'm just a nigga that's evil and spiritual
I know some rappers using big words to make they similes curve
My simplest shit be more pivotal
I penetrate the hearts of good kids and criminals
Worrisome individuals that live life critical
So won't you bear witness while I bare feet?
So you can walk in my shoes and get to know me
But anyway, this for my pops
On his lunch break eating in that parking lot
On "Wanna Be Heard," probably thought he worked my nerves
But really he was stressing me gettin' what I deserve
Somebody said my name on the radio
He ain't know I was ready for the world that minute
So the next time he roll up and drop grams in it
He probably be out of work, laid back, while he

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good
Smoke good, eat good, live good

And I do this for the city
Got some Hennessy and my real niggas with me
Fuck the police, they gon' have to come and get me
If it feel good to you, holler if you hear me

[Outro: GLC]
Church is definitely on the move and now we done took it up to the cathedral
'Cause the ism is enormous, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
We out here rotating under the five P's
Proper preparation prevents poor performance, You know what I'm talking 'bout?
Doing my thing 'cause I'm rotating with my speakers thumping
From the Windy City streets all the way out here to the streets of Compton
Know what I'm talking 'bout?
Church is definitely on the move and we gon' continue to hustle and grow and develop by far
As I rotate with my true player partner by the name of Kendrick Lamar, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
This is the ism, this is the vision, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
Gotta get up off your ass and get it, man
That's the only way your pockets gon' expand
I tell you everyday, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
Apply yourself to supply your wealth
Only limitations you'll ever have are those that you place upon yourself
Church is definitely on the move, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
Exercise your ism, and don't depend on no one else
Cathedral, church, ism
It was all a dream, I used to read a quick Nick magazine
Ren and Stimpy, Tommy Pickles and the games between
I'm watching TV in the dark
Every Saturday Double dare with my main man Marky Mark

Summers, Falls, Winters and Springs
I've seen 19 sets cut me open count the rings
But I wish that I could be 8, 9, or 10
Wearing "Life is Good" t-shirts that made sense back then

You wanna know me well here's a list;
When I tried to hit puberty I swung and I missed
I like palindromes like "do geese see god?"
Or "go hang a salami, I'm a lasagna hog."

And I can do a rubix cube in a minute 20
Fast food and the internet's plenty for me
I'm simple with one dimple
And a weird mole thing on my left nipple

I'm part of the fattest country on the global scale
And were phat with a ph on the ph scale
Because we're so basic
Give us a house and a car and a kid
So we can raise it praise it blaze it up
And get lasik to see how bad we fucked it up

We all had braces our smiles are fake
Another mother saw her hotter daughter's water break
The Miley Cirus virus is as bad as it gets
And similarly as bad as simile Tourette's
Cause like its like I like my right to like
But like I also have like a life to write right? Wrong
This is a road kill song but I couldn't follow the bouncing ball during the sing along
I'm a little tea pot whose steaming mad because the worlds not terrible cause I'm hot

1, 2, Fuck You
I take a stroll around the block to relax my mind
And then I walk by the clock just to pass the time
And rhymin', mathematical timin', syntax impacts the intact hymen trust me
You don't want to fuck with me check my record
Wrecked it on my SAT's I got a 780 math, 730 verbal
Kick a Jonas brother and he'll fart out a gerbil

Voice so sweet call me Mr. Herbal Tea
More deadly than Joseph Goebbel's pee
In a swastika Dixie cup
I got a dick full of helium I'll fuck you up
Put up your fists its a battle of wits
And if you bring your facts sis
Just the cattle with tits
And I'll get mad at their zits
And paddle their bits
With saddles and whips
And rattle their clits...that was rude.....

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul, Alori Joh & Kendrick Lamar]
What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
It's fire in the street, fire in my Swisher
Fire in between the two legs of your lil' sister
Just get a sip of this elixir
Before they crop us out the picture
I've never seen a crop circle
But I seen cops circle the block
I puff squares, but I swear, one day, I'ma stop
My nerves itch
On the brink of my career
While my peers struggle for employment
Can you hear these screams?
(Uncle Sam ain't no kin to me)
One, two, three, four grams and a fifth of Hennessy
A bad bitch, fuck the penitentiary
Section 80s babies, blame Ronald Reagan
We raising hell, hell (Oh)
Lord forbid, the homies got wet, so we trying to soak it in
The president is Black, but you can't vote for skin
You vote for the better man
Come to our show, you could see the diversity
Unify the people, they gon' peep it universally
We might not change the world
But we gon' manipulate it, I hope you participatin'
Ayo, Dot, won't you let these cats know?
We knew we'd be here, like, back in '04
Started HiiiPower because our generation needed a generator
In a system meant to disintegrate us (Ooh)
And all we do is assist them
We're not victors, we're victims
The bigger picture isn't developed yet
Like, what if Keisha was celibate?
Or what if Tammy came across a real man
Who didn't play games like children?
My nigga cheated on his girlfriend
With his girlfriend's girlfriend, let the world end
And everybody tripping off 2012
And the extraterrestrial presence as well
(Odd Future's aight) But our future is not
That martial law shit drop, we gon' all get got
So keep that question mark on your face
Eat your fast food, use your fluoride toothpaste
Hide your feelings from the public, work your lil' nine to five
Don't forget to pay your tithes and thank God you're alive
HiiiPower
And on another note
We focused like the Hubble Telescope
Soul

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Alori Joh]
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
(Life is a traffic jam)
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
(I'm ready to go, ready to go)
Life is a traffic jam, life is a traffic jam
(Ready to go, ready to go)
Life is a traffic jam
Life...

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar & Ab-Soul]
I wrote this because I was ordered to
People say I speak for generation Y
Why lie? I do, Section.80
Your son'll play me if radio won't
Daughters that just turn one 'til twenty-one listen to Kendrick
For instance
What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
Take out that student loan, and pay off your college degree
And do exactly what you see on TV
True story
Hmm
Can you repeat that for me, Soul?
What's your life about? Enlighten me
Is you gon' live on your knees or die on your feet?
Is you gon' plead the fifth or sound the horn?
The time is now, my child, come on
See, a lot of y'all don't understand Kendrick Lamar
Because you wonder how I could talk about money, hoes, clothes, God, and history all in the same sentence
You know what all them things have in common?
Only half of the truth, if you tell it
See I spent twenty-three years on this earth searching for answers
'Til one day I realized I had to come up with my own
I'm not on the outside looking in
I'm not on the inside looking out
I'm in the dead fucking center, looking around
You ever seen a newborn baby kill a grown man?
That's an analogy for the way the world make me react
My innocence been dead
So, the next time I talk about money, hoes, clothes, God, and history all in the same sentence
Just know I meant it, and you felt it
'Cause you too are searching for answers
I'm not the next pop star, I'm not the next socially-aware rapper
I am a human motherfuckin' being over dope-ass instrumentation
Kendrick Lamar
Now fuck 'em up, Terrace
(Soul)

[Instrumental Solo: Terrace Martin]

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
I watch this fire that we’re gathered around
And see that it burns similar to the fire that’s inside you
Section.80
Section.80 babies
A generation of bliss and disobedience
No, they can't control us
No, they can't control you
No, they can't control us
But we can control each other
We build our own world
If you don't leave with nothing else tonight
You will leave with knowing yourself
You will leave knowing that you represent something that's bigger than all of us
Our family
Heart, honor, and respect
This is you
This is me
And we are HiiiPower

[Intro: JaVonté]
In time, you'll learn this is about you
In time, you'll learn this is about you
In time, you'll learn this is about you

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Babies from '80s don't know, know no better
Don't nothing go better with ignorance but the belligerent kids that we living with
Some of them masculine, some of them feminine
'Member the universe used to be innocent?
Now they just look at us crazy like immigrants
Every day that I wake up, I'ma sin again
I'm not a citizen, I'm just a nigga from Section.80

[Outro]
Show of hands, how many been taking notes?
Good
Leave everything on the table now
Vulnerability
This is your generation
Show, show your pain

[Intro]
La da da da daaaa (Okay...cause it never felt like that)
La da da da daaaa ( uh uh... its like)
Ohh (Every touch.. every kiss...static baby)
Ohhh (hahah..yeah)

[Verse 1]
Baby, I don't really know which way to go
It's like your energy keep callin'
I, Im bout to lose my self composure
Even sex has got me braggin'
And You, you look so good
I wish you would give me what Im looking for
Touch is so electric
Got my heart racing. Pulse is off the charts
And I can't even front. I'll be there 1 on 1
And you're the one I want girl

[Hook]
You're like static
It's way beyond me girl, its like magic
Got me feenin' for your touch like an addict. Gotta have it
Girl this thing feels so good, so I wish you would
You're like static
Girl this thing feels so good, so I wish you would

[Verse 2]
And I ain't even playing girl
Theres so much truth in what Im saying girl
You got my head all in it. Like a game of chess baby check me
This ain't no first date. Don't hesitate. No ??
And Ima take it nice and slow, yeah. Take your body where it needs to go
Give me what Im looking for. Touch is so electric
Got my heart racing. Pulse is off the charts
And I can't even front, I need the 1 on 1
You're the one I want, girl

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Doin' 85 on a freeway. Switchin' lanes in my "range"
GPS is saying next exit. I got your text message
I'm on my way to you. Here's what were gonna do
And girl I'll take it to you. Fit closer, don't stop
Don't mess up the flow. Don't be scared
Touch right there. Make it personal
I don't really know what it is that you do
Its like a force, im stuck onto you like static

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Living
Just ain't what it was in the beginning
And if you love me, you could feel what I'm feeling
Filled with agony, and misery, but I'm dealing
And somehow rebuilding
(Yeah)

[Bridge]
What work for me, don't work for you
What bring joy to me, bring hurt to you
What's best for me, ain't best for you
So it's all that I, have left to do
And I know you think, I'm selfish too
Sooo...

[Hook]
Alone I stand in the dark, right behind this microphone
Tried to pick up all the pieces to my broken heart, to decide what's right and wrong
When the people that you love are gone, when this house is just not a home
I know that I ain't gunna be happy with nobody else, I'd rather live my life alone
I guess I live my life alone

[Verse 2]
Leaving
Makes more sense than fighting every evening
All these arguments about nothing, yelling and screaming
And you would rather be without me, or so it's seeming
Or am I dreaming?

[Bridge]
What work for me, don't work for you
What bring joy to me, bring hurt to you
What's best for me, ain't best for you
So it's all that I, have left to do
And I know you think, I'm selfish too
Sooo...

[Hook]
Alone I stand in the dark, right behind this microphone
Tried to pick up all the pieces to my broken heart, to decide what's right and wrong
When the people that you love are gone, when this house is just not a home
I know that I ain't gunna be happy with nobody else, I'd rather live my life alone
I guess I live my life alone

[Verse 3]
Born alone
Life live, die alone
Fall in love, break-up cry alone
I lie alone
In bed by myself
I might as well
Break up outta here
Invite her here
Blank out kill the bitch
And go to jail
I don't give a shit
This empty house, I can't live in it
So I put you out my misery
This how I feel, until she right here with me
And then I tell her, look at what you did to me
Get down and beg her, to stay right here with me
Because the pain too severe for me
I said the pains too severe for me

[Hook]
Alone I stand in the dark, right behind this microphone
Tried to pick up all the pieces to my broken heart, to decide what's right and wrong
When the people that you love are gone, when this house is just not a home
I know that I ain't gunna be happy with nobody else, I'd rather live my life alone
I guess I live my life alone

[Intro]
We're gonna skate to one song, one song only
Ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
So I ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
But first niggas gotta find me
What's fifty grand to a motherfucker like me? Can you please remind me?
(Ball so hard) This shit crazy
Y'all don't know that don't shit faze me
The Nets could go 0 for 82
And I'd look at you like this shit gravy
(Ball so hard) This shit weird
We ain't even 'posed to be here
(Ball so hard) Since we here
It's only right that we'd be fair
Psycho, I'm liable to go Michael, take your pick
Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6
(Ball so hard) Got a broke clock
Rollies that don't tick-tock
Audemars that's losing time
Hidden behind all these big rocks
(B-ball so hard) I'm shocked too
I'm supposed to be locked up too
You escaped what I escaped
You'd be in Paris getting fucked up too
(B-ball so hard) Let's get faded
Le Meurice for like six days
Gold bottles, scold models
Spillin' Ace on my sick J's
(Ball so hard) Bitch, behave
Just might let you meet Ye
Chi-Town's D. Rose
I'm moving the Nets, BK

[Chorus: JAY-Z & Kanye West]
Ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray
B-ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray

[Verse 2: Kanye West & JAY-Z]
She said, "Ye, can we get married at the mall?"
I said, "Look, you need to crawl 'fore you ball"
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall
And show me why you deserve to have it all
(Ball so hard) That shit cray, ain't it, Jay?
(B-ball so hard) What she order, fish fillet?
(B-ball so hard) Your whip so cold, this old thing?
(Ball so hard) Act like you'll ever be around motherfuckers like this again
Bougie girl, grab her hand
Fuck that bitch, she don't wanna dance
Excuse my French, but I'm in France, ahah, I'm just sayin'
Prince Williams ain't do it right, if you ask me
'Cause I was him, I would have married Kate and Ashley
What's Gucci, my nigga? What's Louis, my killer?
What's drugs, my dealer? What's that jacket, Margiela?
Doctors say I'm the illest 'cause I'm suffering from realness
Got my niggas in Paris and they going gorillas, huh

[Interlude]
I don't even know what that means
No one knows what it means, but it's provocative
No, it's not, it's gross
Gets the people going

[Chorus: JAY-Z]
Ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me
B-ball so hard, motherfuckers wanna fine me

[Outro: Kanye West, JAY-Z & Both]
You are now watching the throne
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
These other niggas is lyin'
Actin' like the summer ain't mine
(I got that hot bitch in my home)
You know how many hot bitches I own?
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
Don't let me get in my zone
The stars is in the building
They hands is to the ceiling
I know I'm 'bout to kill it
How you know? I got that feeling
You are now watching the throne
Don't let me into my zone
Don't let me into my zone
(I'm definitely in my zone)

[Intro: Jay Z]
We in the time of our lives, baby
Turn the music up, prime time
Uh, yeah

[Verse 1: Jay Z, Jay Z & Kanye West]
Prime time, beat by Dion
Our third eon, that's what the fuck we on
More money, forty-year-old phenom
My fifteen minutes of fame has stretched beyond
At forty-two, be better than twenty-fours
I carried the four-five, mastered forty-eight laws
Still wearing my 23s, they can't fuck with the boy
Far as them sixteens, I'm 23 of it all
Prime time, riding that six-deuce
That 911, I only subtract the roof
I started in '88, got warm in '92
I landed in '96, that's the year I came through
I hit the club, ordered some Grey Goose
Switched it for CÎROC to give Puff's stock a boost
New money, I found the fountain of youth
I'm headed to Miami to fuck up the Fontainebleau
A case of Ace, make it two
Nigga, we rollin', beat the deuce
The night is young, what the fuck we gon' do? Ooh

[Chorus: Kanye West]
The night is young, what the fuck you wanna do, huh?
The night is young, what the fuck we gon' do, huh?
The night is young, what you really wanna do, huh?

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Prime time, basking in the lime
Cassius in his prime, coloring out of the line
'Cause they don't want nobody that's colored out of the lines
So I'm late as a motherfucker, colored people time
Damn, Yeezy, they all gotta be dimes?
Well, Adam gave up a rib, so mine better be prime
Niggas gon' kill me, I swear they better be lying
I never live in fear, I'm too out of my mind
Prime time, never hit these heights
I mean it's like, it's like our first first-class flight
I'm tripping on it, socks on marble floors, I'm slipping on it
Champagne, I'm sipping on it, shit tastes different, don't it?
You know what? You right
It's like the best damn champagne I had in my life
"When you coming home?" That's a text from my wife
I told her run a bubble bath
And float in that motherfucker like a hovercraft
And soak in that motherfucker 'til I call you back
I mean, who says shit like that and doesn't laugh?
Hah

[Chorus: Kanye West]
The night is young, what the fuck you wanna do, huh?
The night is young, what the fuck we gon' do, huh?
The night is young, what you really wanna do, huh?

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
Ooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know
Ooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know
Ooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know
Ooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Picture, if you will, that the throne's burning
Rome's burning, and I'm sitting in the corner all alone, burning
Why does it always end up like this?
Something that we don't determine
Same people that I fought for, that I fight for, that I ride for
That I live for, that I die for
Be the reason that these niggas is alive for
And they want me dead, but I'm sorry, but I just can't die for you
But I can make 'em put their hands in the sky for you
We waiting for the fireworks like July 4th
Get fly more, get high more, cry boy, why for?
When the grief is over, beef is over
I'll be fly when Easter's over
I tried to teach niggas how to be kings
And all they ever wanted to be was soldiers
So when love is gone 'til blood is drawn
'Cause we no longer wear the same uniform
Fuck you, squares, the circle got smaller
The castle got bigger, the walls got taller
And truth be told, after all that said
Niggas still got love for you

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
Ooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know
Ooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know
Ooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know
Ooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know

[Verse 2: Jay-Z & Kanye West]
Showed love to you niggas
You ripped out my heart and you stepped on it
I picked up the pieces 'fore you swept on it
Goddamn, this shit leaves a mess, don't it?
Shit feelin' like death, don't it?
Charge it to the game, whatever's left on it
I spent about a minute, maybe less on it
Fly, pelican, fly, turn the jets on it
But first I shall digress on it
Wasn't I a good king?
Maybe too much of a good thing, huh?
Didn't I spoil you? Me or the money, what you loyal to?
Huh, I gave you my loyalty
Made you royalty and royalties
Took care of these niggas' lawyer fees
And this is how niggas rewarded me, damn

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
Ooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know
Ooh, I love you so
But why I love you, I'll never know

[Verse 3: Jay-Z & Kanye West]
Bussin' at me, b-b-b-bussin' at me
But I'm bulletproof, bitch, you can't get nothin' past me
Got body armor
A nigga gotta watch the throne
And I'm bussin' back
So niggas in a glass house should not throw stones
What do you do when the love turn to hate?
Gotta separate from these fuckin' fakes
Caesar didn't see it, so he ceased to exist
So the nigga that killed him had keys to his shit
Am I my brother's keeper?
Only if that nigga don't creep up
Got a pistol under my pillow
I've never been a deep sleeper
P-P-P-Paranoia, 'cause the nigga that said he'll
Blast for ya is now blastin' for ya
That's an assassin for ya
These niggas got a shot, they'll shoot
Please Lord, forgive him
For these niggas not know what they do, ooh

[Intro: Frank Ocean]
And He'll bring you out the, out the darkness

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Sweet king Martin, sweet queen Coretta
Sweet brother Malcolm, sweet queen Betty
Sweet Mother Mary, sweet father Joseph
Sweet Jesus, we made it in America
Sweet baby Jesus (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh, sweet baby Jesus, we made it in America
Sweet baby Jesus (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh, sweet baby Jesus, we made it in America

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I told my mama I was on the come up
She said, "You going to school, I'll give you a summer"
Then she met No I.D. and gave me his number
Ten years later, she driving a Hummer
Niggas hustle every day for a beat from Ye
What I do? Turn around, gave them beats to Jay
And I'm rapping on the beats they was supposed to buy
I guess I'm getting high off my own supply
Downtown mixing fabrics, tryna find the magic
Started a little blog just to get some traffic
Old folks'll tell you not to play in traffic, uh
A million hits and the web crashes, damn
South Park had 'em all laughing
Now all my niggas designing and we all swaggin', uh
Ignore the critics just to say we did it
This ain't no fashion show, motherfucker, we live it

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Sweet king Martin, sweet queen Coretta
Sweet brother Malcolm, sweet queen Betty
Sweet Mother Mary, sweet father Joseph
Sweet Jesus, we made it in America
Sweet baby Jesus (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh, sweet baby Jesus, we made it in America
Sweet baby Jesus (Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Oh, sweet baby Jesus, we made it in America

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I pledge allegiance to my grandma
For that banana pudding, our piece of Americana
Our apple pie was supplied through Arm & Hammer
Straight out the kitchen, shh, don't wake nana
Built a republic that still stands
I'm tryna lead a nation to leave to my little man's
Or my daughter, so I'm boiling this water
The scales was lopsided, I'm just restoring order
Hold up, here comes grandma, what's up Yaya?
What's that smell? Oh, I'm just boiling some agua
No papa, bad Santa
The streets raised me, pardon my bad manners
I got my liberty chopping grams up
Street justice, I pray God understand us
I pledge allegiance to all the scramblers
This is the Star-Spangled Banner

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Sweet king Martin, sweet queen Coretta
Sweet brother Malcolm, sweet queen Betty
Sweet Mother Mary, sweet father Joseph

Oh, sweet baby Jesus, we made it in America

[Intro]
Plain Pat, what up?

[Verse]
I've always been the same since back in the day
Always felt like we should get paid
To be on magazines or we get played
Why did he say it? I don't know, ask Gabe
Now I'm on the magazines where the roses are
Poppin' champagne and that Rosé Dom
Won a few awards, then we went on tour
And yup, in my bag, a whole bag of porn
Magazines hate him, then they love him
Then they hate him (We hate him)
Fuck it, what to say then? (fuck it)
Cover of The Fader (Yeah)
Now I'm on my way up (Now I'm on my way up!)
Now you want me say what? Huh, you want me say what?
I be talking my shit so I guess I'm an asshole
They be kick and pushin' like Lu Fiasco
And I guess every time I'm just gon' get in that mode
Suck up to the press, I guess I missed that boat
I did an interview with the Rolling Stones
Read the interview, man, the whole shit wrong
Far as this shit go, you know the way I wanna glow
I need Al Gore to recount that vote
You know, you know
You know, you know
You think that you know, but you have no idea
You think you really know, but you have no idea
You think you really know, but I'm right here
You think you really know, but you have no idea
And I'm gon' be the same my whole career, yeah
I'm gon' stay the same my whole career, you know?
Me, I'm ridin' clean, smokin' good, can barely keep my eyes open
Listenin' to my favorite song, leanin' in my car chokin'
Tell my dawg to 'hit this weed,' feel like I'm finna pass out
Thought I had exclusive trees, until he pulled his bag out
Half out, a half ounce, some shit I never seen in life
Said that once he bagged it, smelled so bad, he had to bag it twice
I told him 'roll that shit up', this weed I had to light
These clowns somewhere in the clouds, me I'mma satellite
I roll em' very nice
With smoke comin' out the end like a muffler, got game from the hustler
Never said I'm gon' quit, can't get enough of good weed in my lungs
Plus I'm sharin' I ain't cuffin'
My eyes wide shut, I'm just starin' sayin' nothin'
I flick ashes, got big stashes
So I don't need a dime, I got big baggage bitch !
Yeah, I blow it by the zip
Anywhere I go, it's on the road, on every trip
Ask my nene, love her grandson, but she know that I'mma trip
Got my habit from this ?, smokin' roaches gettin' lit
Now I feel my blunt with so much weed, they say 'that all ain't gon' fit'
On some highly grown shit, with a hollywood bitch
Got the sweetest purple kush and a precisely rolled spliff
Hot as . . . ? Pole's Bic
On the way to see Marcella's,
Girl I'm in another world and Chevy got another twirl
For those who don't know, he got that roll game
And I ain't gon' lie, he the reason why I got my roll game
Feel like I'm Soul Plane
I smoke the whole thing
Pound or O.Z
Kush fiend, Purple, Master, OG
(Yeah, that's a little bit of kush talk for yall' niggas who might not comprehend)
And every nigga that grow weed should know me
My leather so soft, my swishers so sweet bitch !

[Intro]
Yeah
Oh-woah-oh, woah-oh
Oh-woah-woah

[Verse 1]
What the hell, babe?
Damn, I ain't never felt this way

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, you're so beautiful (You're beautiful)
Every time I see you, girl, it throw me off (Throw me off)
It's so unusual (Unusual) for me to be waiting
But I don't wanna blow it, girl
But you should know this, girl, oh

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna be the one to mess this up
'Cause I done effed up in love before
I'ma be the one to take a back-seat, girl
We can take our time and you can run this

Anything you want, girl, we can do
Girl, are we going down? I don't know
But from here now, baby, I'm gon' leave that up to you
I'm gonna leave it up to you, oh

[Verse 2]
What the hell, babe?
Make me wanna jump out an airplane
The way it feels, I just can't explain
I don't wanna lose this, so I'm just gon' stay out my own way

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, you're so incredible (You're beautiful)
Every time I see you, girl, it throw me off (Throw me off)
It's some kind of special (Unusual) so I'm gon' keep waiting
But I don't wanna blow it, girl
But you should know this girl, woah-woah-woah

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna be the one to mess this up
'Cause I done effed up in love before
I'ma be the one to take a back-seat, girl
We can take our time (Oh) and you can run this
Stay in (Yeah-yeah), go out (Yeah-yeah)
Anything you want, girl, we can do (We can do)
Girl, are we going down? I don't know
But from here now, baby, I'm gon' leave that up to you

[Bridge]
I'm not tryna be a heart breaker like I was before, that was the old me
I've made so many tears, I don't wanna make no, make no more
So give me your list, let's start checking things off
Ready to go to work, baby, you can be boss
And I'm okay with it, ain't gon' play with it
So, baby girl, it's your call

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna be the one to mess this up (Oh, not gonna mess it up)
'Cause I done effed up in love before (Been in love before)
I'ma be the one to take a back-seat, girl (Oh, girl)
We can take our time and you can run this (Ooh, woah)
Stay in, go out (In or out, girl)
Anything you want, girl, we can do (We can do)
Girl, are we going down? (Oh) I don't know (Oh)
But from here now (Here now)

[Outro]
Baby, I'm gon' leave that up to you, woah-oh
I'm gon' leave that you to you
Leave that up to you, woah
I'm gon' leave that you to you
Leave it up to you, woah-oh
I'm gon' leave it up to you
Leave it up to you, you, you
I'm gon' leave it up to you
I'm gon' leave it up to you
I'm gon' leave it up to you

[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
I get my hip-hop on
I get my hip-hop on
Allow me to get my hip-hop on
Allow me to get my hip-hop on

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Just a little story that I got to tell
About a boy named Lu and a girl named Chenelle
She from the ghetto, he is as well
He listens to The Neptunes, she Mr. Kells
So while his head was in the clouds
She was on the down-low, foul, more so
The '03 version of a virgin
Said she learned head from a porno (Word?)
Upbringing was worse than he
She from a broken home
One day broke father broke in home
Lookin' for a fix from brokenhearted momma
Choked and broke her bones
Now he dismayed
Cause he don't think things need to be that way
Now he at work, and she at play
And she get paid
But he don't think she could ever be that way

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
You'd better MAKE SURE your game is tight
Cause you don't wanna risk bein' a lame tonight
Cause that PIMP HAND will smack you down
Make you hit the road, don't come back around

You'd better MAKE SURE your game is tight
Cause you don't wanna risk bein' a lame tonight
Cause that PIMP HAND will lay you low
Don't hate the playa, just the way it go

[Lupe Fiasco: Verse 2]
Now Lu's not your ordinary mild-mannered man
Who doesn't man up
Who just got caught with his pants down and his hands up
NAW
He's a dog, he's a playa he's a mack
Who preys on the weak and the meek and the quiet
Try to make 'em into freaks
Gets with the big girls with jobs
And tell 'em "

[They] don't really need to diet,"
NO
Then it's free Micky D's for he
And it's three until she gets herself fired
"Sorry,"
LIAR, he don't care, he gon' say whatever she want hear
Whatever it takes
To get whatever he want or what he won't wear
Plaid
She think he won't dare
Creep with her friends when her ends end
Boo be prepared, cause he ain't scared

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
You'd better MAKE SURE your game is tight
Cause you don't wanna risk bein' a lame tonight
Cause that PIMP HAND will smack you down
Make you hit the road don't come back around

You'd better MAKE SURE your game is tight
Cause you don't wanna risk bein' a lame tonight
Cause that PIMP HAND will lay you low
Don't hate the playa, just the way it go

[Lupe Fiasco: Verse 3]
No matter how much strength man
You think that your pimp hand has got
It pose no opposition to politicians
They so efficient in they tradition
They pimpin' is tops
School is a mack with a track
It's historical fact
Bring back the tax
Air Force One is a 'Lac
Bombs over Baghdad, johns in Iraq
Yes indeed, Democracy is a flirt in a miniskirt
Trying to give a handjob to the desert
Till it squirt Texas Tea
And give a condom to Congress to stretch the siege
Best believe, you'll catch disease
Siphyllus of the spirit
Arthritis of the knees
And you can watch on the idiot box
This NBC is like Spice, alright!

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
You'd better MAKE SURE your game is tight
Cause you don't wanna risk bein' a lame tonight
Cause that PIMP HAND will smack you down
Make you hit the road don't come back around

You'd better MAKE SURE your game is tight
Cause you don't wanna risk bein' a lame tonight
Cause that PIMP HAND will lay you low
Don't hate the playa, just the way it go

[Verse 1: Ninja]
I'm a ninja, yo
My life is like a video game
I maintain when I'm in the zone
One player, one life on the mic limited time (Yo Ninja, go!)
No fucking around I'm cutting down anyone in my path
Trying to fuck with my game with razor sharp lyrical throw stars
Here my flow's hot
Ho$$tyle
Wild, out of control
Ninja skop befokte rof taal
Rough rhymes for tough times
Met fokol kos, skraal
Till I hit triple seven at the ATM
Straight famine or feast
When you living on the razor edge
Stay sharp sharp
Rolling with the $0$
High energy
You never seen Zef so fresh
Uh! When we mic check Hi-Tek flows flex
Yo we optimistic, not fuckin' depressed
We not like the rest
My style is UFO
Totally unknown
You can't fuck with my new Zef flow
I'm hard to miss
"You can't do this, you can't do that"
Yo, fuckin' who said so?
I do what I like
Too hot to handle
Too cold to hold
You can't fuck with the chosen one
I-I-I-I-I want the knife
Yo I'm a Ninja

[Chrous: Yolandi]
I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Be my samurai
I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection

[Verse 2: Ninja]
Ninja is poes-kool
But don't fuck with my game, boy
Or I'll poes you
Life is tough when I get stuck
And my time is up I push through
Till I break-break-break on through to the other side
Fantastically poor with patience like a stalker
Ninja is hardcore
Been cut so deep, feel no pain, it's not sore
Don't ask for kak or you'll get what you ask for
I'm like a wild animal in the corner
Waiting for the break of dawn
Trying to get through the night
Just a man with the will to survive
My blades swing free
Decapitate a hater
With amazing ease
This is not a game, boy
Don't play with me
I work my mic-saber like a wild fucking savage from the dark side danger!
Yin to the yang
Totally Hi-Tek, Ninja's motherfucking big in Japan
I seen the future but I never got nothing in my hand
Except a microphone, big dreams, and a plan
Fly-talking, sky-walking
Like a ninja

[Chrous: Yolandi]
I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Be my samurai
I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Need your protection

[Outro: Ninja]
Fuck this is like...
The coolest song I ever heard in my whole life
Fuck all of you who said I wouldn't make it
They said I was a loser
They said I was a no-one
They said I was a fucking psycho
But look at me now, all up in the interweb, world wide
2009, futuristic
Enter the Ninja
Yo-Landi Vi$$er
DJ Hi-Tek
Die fokken Antwoord

[Chrous: Yolandi]
I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Be my samurai
I, I, I
I am your butterfly
I need your protection
Need your protection

The modern day coppers beating on us for the papers

[Chorus 3]
I just give a damn, damn, damn

[Refrain 2]
Just give a- Just give a- Just- I- (x14)

Assult with poolstick
Say I commit that
They label me "convict" I don't accept that
Step back like a step-child
The dope's stepped on
My hood the X Files

[Intro on Ryan Lewis Remix]
"Vipassana is a science of mind and matter: how the mind is influencing the body and later how the body is influencing the mind."

[Verse 1]
Yesterday?
Forget it
Tomorrow is?
Nada
The present is right here, through the breath, watch it
Atheist Jesus piece, hangin' on a cross
We sit and discuss God on lawn chairs
About how we got here
What it is, what it isn't, shit
Fate versus faith, scrimmaging with coincidence
Leave out the marketing, hold up on the business end
Focus on the genuine, and everything else, you can shed the skin
I was a couple moves away from being dead
In that ER overdosing, eyes bleeding red
I fell in love, made an album, got a buzz
Lost it all, sobered up, and guess what?
Now we meet again
And now I'm back, finally just laughin'
Expectations are resentments waiting to happen
Studying the dharma, karma, vipassana practice
Bahá'u'lláh, Buddha, God, to the mountaintop and I'm traveling
Learning, yes, reflecting on what matters
People, impermanence, lack of attachments
It's space and time, a couple of man-made distractions
The measure of a spirit that no human can ever capture
Church, this booth is my Vatican
I don't control life, but I can control how I react to it
Student of the breath, brick beats and balancin'
Desire versus truth until I finally find happiness

[Hook]
Passing through space and time
Passing through space and time, oh
Passing through space and time
Space and time
Space and time

[Verse 2]
I was put here to do something before I'm lying in that casket
I'd be lying on the beat if I said I didn't know what that is
The world's a stage and we play a character, I found him
It took me twenty-something years and a bunch of shitty soundchecks
I'm not gonna be content, until I find gratitude
Regardless of my sales or the record deals they're handing you
If the next generation takes our legacy and samples you
We'll have a bunch of mp3s and misled kids to pass 'em to
I use my veins to create the color I paint from
Delve into self 'til my heart becomes my paint brush
I told my mama I'm not stoppin' 'til my name's up
Thinking those comments on that blog is gonna save us
Searchin' for everything but God to validate you
Get insecure and then we start blaming the haters
Used to look to women to fill a part of me that was vacant
Truth, the only thing that I ever used in moderation
So I stare into this paper instead of sitting at a cubicle
Take all the ugly shit inside and try to make it beautiful
Use the cement from rock bottom and make it musical
So the people can relate to where I've been
Where I'm going, what I've seen, what I've heard
From the guts, fuck the glory
Just a person on a porch putting it all into recording
Many in my past and many that came before me
I just keep walkin' my path and blessed to share my story

[Hook]
Passing through space and time
Passing through space and time, oh
Passing through space and time
Space and time
Space and time

[Verse 1: Bishop Brigante]
It's fuckin' losers like you that make me do what I do
Make me hate where I'm from, you as fake as they come
Everybody got guns, who the fuck gonna squeeze
Everybody got songs, but you ain't fucking with these
Why you wish to be ghetto, tell me what's it about
While you're tryna get in we're all tryna get out
Why don't you just be yourself, why don't you tell us the truth
Like how you only load guns when you up in the booth
You ain't nothin' to shoot, you don't even exist
You're just a fantasy family as weak as it gets
And you ain't speakin' to Bish, cause I don't listen to chicks
I don't argue with broads, cause I'm really a pimp
But I will tell you this, as far as y'all are concerned
Pull out my Santa Claus, and make the holidays burn
You can call me the Grinch, cause y'all are nothing but Who's
Just another bunch of low life's with nothing to do

[Verse 2: Ken Masters]
Now let the kids play like the rider's ride
We spendin' all day, these niggas idolize
They claim they want fame nigga so we decided
That we gon' make 'em some stars until the drama dies
But they can go back to they holes where they mama lies
Or write more lies about they drugs, guns or homicide
Funny, claim the thug life that they abidin' by
But run up on 'em, then they turn into the silent type, they wanna compromise
My niggas, we ride or die
And roll with them bitches that got they body right
These niggas ain't built, ain't got the body type
Time to break a nigga's spirit like the Amistad, tryna fool the audience
Feel the ambience
Stars in your presence, kings of the city are appalled by the peasants
Ain't gotta say names, we can all get a reference
Brains and the info from your broads in the west end
Masters, flowing staggers on bars
Nigga stay mad cause his swagger's on Mars
Y'all niggas ain't thinking we calling y'all 'tards
Claim you want war, okay, on guard

[Verse 3: Young Tony]
Ayo, hey you Mr. Rapper Guy
When you in the booth, tell me why you have to lie
Come on, spit the truth, all I hear is bang bang, hustle this, hustle that
But if you hustle crack, then where the money at?
No proof, Dr. Seuss, story tellin' when he rhyme, like
Once upon a time I was really on the grind
There's another lie, couldn't out-hustle me
Hatin' when it come to D, I can take you're starting 5
I'm only goin' at generic rap niggas that
Rap about ki's but couldn't show me 10 G's
And these nigga' dry snitching on they tees
Standing out, like a sore thumb to the D's
My nigga please, if you really had work
You would do what you do and wouldn't put it on your shirt
It makes my heart hurt when dumb niggas act hood
You ain't no hustla, just a nigga that can rap good

[Verse 4: Jonny Roxx]
See there's a height requirement, nigga to mention my name (smarten up)
How the fuck you little niggas didn't stay in your lane
Man you offered me a truce and I took it
Now I hear this bullshit so how the fuck am I to overlook it?
If this little nigga survive then it gotta be God
How the fuck are you a hustla with your factory job ?
And I don't get it, nigga I'm a fucking diabetic
And I don't usually eat y'all sweet niggas
Every time I see y'all retard niggas y'all bitch out
Waddup Roxx? now we cool? then you dip out
Talkin' all that bang bang shit, pull a clip out
Sayin' you a blood, next week you prolly crip out
I'm saying, we don't believe y'all niggas (nah)
G-35, x5 nah niggas (yeah)
This here is a public announcement for my niggas (yeah)
No more goodnight, good mornin', goodbye niggas

[Verse 5: JD Era]
I don't appreciate niggas sayin' my name in they bullshit
It's like putting a knife against the lyrical full-clip
Do shit on my own, I never asked for help
If I was rapping like y'all I woulda killed myself
And nah, this ain't beef, it's missing a few ingredients
Dog you ain't a general, stick to being obedient
Piggy back, that ain't something I had to do
Laughing at Drake? you should'a seen how I was laughing at you
I don't beef over little shit, angry? A little bit
Little niggas get little recognition you little bitch
I don't do the little subliminals, I'm addressin' it
And if Littles wanna get in the middle then I'm suggesting it
They called you a bitch, were tryna act out
They challenge 'em to a fight and then they back out
So tell me how the fuck I can respect you cats
If you a gangsta, then what part of the game is that?

[Verse 6: Drake]
Hey yo Aristo, I'm lost, can you tell me whats goin' on in the streets?
How it feel to count dough while you palmin' the heat?
And yes I asked for a 16, you did your 16
I heard that weak shit and only wanted the beat (it's true)
But fuck the money and the cars that I drive to set
And fuck the women that's lying to all the guys they met
And fuck the features on my songs and the deals on the table
Or basically it's fuck everything that you strive to get
And it's the room of resolution, I'm finishing it in here
If I copy Budden's flow, you mimickin' his career
And the same money we hearin' you giving to charity
You need to be giving to Littles to give him some clarity (what up Littles)
'Cause that's your homeboy I think he's owed that much
Tell him pressing 25 don't mean you sold that much
And Breana, I don't mean to alarm ya
But you need to get outside the car to shoot this video in Parma (Tony!)
You act like you hood and hood niggas'll harm ya
And this is not hatin' my nigga we call it karma
But yo Thug Life, show me where the hammer be
Yes I took an L on my own and they didn't damage me
You try to cover up your lies like a canopy
And tryna pull 17 year olds down in Bramalea (I know about it)
And we don't got it out for you
We just saying that don't nobody vouch for you
Nope, nobody thorough is willing to give a cosign (nobody)
And you don't even sell blow, you just blow time
You can't even get a factor grant
So stop rapping, go fix parts at a tractor plant (damn)
And listen here, Tetley Tea
You one of the seven dwarfs standing next to me
You probably snitchin' in court, then accept the plea
And I hear you paying these women and I sex for free (what up sweetheart)
But dog, how did this start, how we get to this part?
We all got niggas doing bids "Mr. Wishheart" (what up Cam)
It's not cool to use another nigga's as a threat tho'
I said you a bitch, I heard a seven man echo
You saying I hustle, my source for currency coke
They saying you never moving it and currently broke
And you risk doing crack time and hang around black crime
Just so you can have something to say in you rap lines
They say Drake killed it like young girls at a private school (I did)
Dog if I were you, I tell you what I would do
I would cut ties with the cops and just make them fire you
Lose the body pack and the velcro you feed the wire through
Tell them not to call and that's even if they require you
'Cause they the only people recording that wanna hire you (it's true)
With what I spend in a weekend I could acquire you
Some of them believe you got money you little liar you
But, I don't admire you, short niggas tell tall tales
Good riddance Aristo I just retired you!

[Verse 1]
Why’d you have to leave in July
On a peaceful and serene Summer night
I wish that you would've waited until September
Just a couple more memories to remember
I guess I have to pay you back to your lender
I guess I have to send you back to the sender
But then again maybe you're gone til November
And maybe this is just part of the agenda

[Hook]
Why’d you have to go so soon
We miss you, we miss you, we miss you
We miss you, we miss you, we miss you

[Verse 2]
Why couldn’t you come right home
When you seen the text message in your phone
I should have put my pride aside to come and find you
I could've told you about the niggas that's behind you
Could have told you all about my intuition
I could have even bought the extra ammunition
But now you moved on so fuck you
Should’ve known from day one I couldn’t trust you

[Hook]
Why’d you have to go so soon
We miss you, we miss you, we miss you
We miss you, we miss you, we miss you

[Verse 3]
Why would they take you from me
Why the doctors couldn't stop the bleeding
If you in a better place, then you’re free
Well then, why can’t they make me believe it
You said that you will leave these streets
And I know you didn’t mean in a body bag
But now you see you not bulletproof
And I’m mad cause
You’re the best that I’ve ever had

[Hook]
Why’d you have to go so soon
We miss you, we miss you, we miss you
We miss you, we miss you, we miss you

[Outro]
I’ll never love again
I’ll never love again
I’ll never, I’ll never
I’ll never love again
What would you suggest that I do now
Why’d you leave
I hate you

[Chorus]
I know my eyes already like you, baby, you
I know that love, love is found
Love is found

[Verse]
I cut the radio on
I know it won’t be long
I can hear you baby
I can feel your sound
I'm putting closer now
Now like I feel the sound

[Chorus]
I know my eyes already like you, baby, you
And I know that love, love is found
Love is found

[Refrain]
Oh, and my heart go ba-boom-ba-boom
Ba-ba-boom ba-ba-boom-boom
My heart go ba-boom-ba-boom

[Chorus]
I know my eyes already like you, baby, you
And I know that love, love is found
Love is found

[Refrain]
Oh, and my heart go ba-boom-ba-boom
Ba-ba-boom ba-ba-boom-boom
My heart go ba-boom-ba-boom

[Chorus]
I know my eyes already like you, baby, you
And I know that love, love is found
Love is found

[Pre-Chorus: Akon & Chris Brown]
Let me love you, girl, show me love (Hey)

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
She on the pole (What?), watch her break it down (Break it down)
Her booty swole, her ass shake the ground
Pop that booty now, pop that, pop that booty now
Pop that booty now, pop, pop, pop that booty now
Breezy in this bitch, I make 'em yell, I make 'em holler
What you talkin' 'bout? Hell yeah, I got them dollars
And money on they mind, money, money on they mind
And my presidents is goin' in the air when she whines on my
Potty mouth, she's from the south, she's dancin' on my whoa (Bop!)
After that, I give her more bread then she dances on Polow (Leggo)
Up and down just like pogo (Nuh-uh), give her more money then she go
On the floor, on the floor, take it down, take it down, down low
For all the strippers that's on my hitlist, watch how many racks I blow
They say this liquor is bad for my kidneys, I know, I know, I know (Yeah!)
And I got 'em all takin' off their clothes and I got 'em all workin' on that pose
I'm the bomb like napalm, Akon what you waitin' on? Leggo

[Chorus: Akon]
Take it down, take it down, take it down, take it down low (Ooh)

Take it low, girl, take it low, girl, oh woah
Yeah, I like that, leggo

[Verse 1]
I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show

[Chorus]
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love?
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breakin’ us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

[Verse 2]
I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
You're my saviour when I fall

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside
That I really do
And it's me you need to show

[Chorus]
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love
How deep is your love
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breakin’ us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

[Bridge]
Da-da-da-da-da
Na-na-na na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show

[Chorus]
How deep is your love?
How deep is your love
How deep is your love
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breakin’ us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

How deep is your love
How deep is your love
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breakin’ us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

How deep is your love
How deep is your love
I really mean to learn
'Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breakin’ us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
Holiday season!

Ricky Racks I See You!

[Hook - Gucci Mane]
If being filthy rich is a crime
I guess I'm guilty bitch
I guess I'm guilty bitch
I killed the rap and last night
I pleaded self-defense
I guess I'm guilty bitch
I guess I'm guilty bitch

[Verse 1 - Gucci Mane]
These suckas talking nonsense
I killed your homeboy
Cause I don't have a conscience
I'm strapped like Bronson
Brick Squad, Trap House, beat bunking
I'm wild like Tarzan
I'm swinging through the Zone 6
In Ferraris. It's on again
I go to win, strap-for-strap
I go rap for rap, I rep the trap
Refuse the death but game to slap
My phone is tapped
I'm off the wall and off the scale
Came out of jail like
A bat out of hell
I refuse to pay up, gotta salute the myth
Got Clientele, I might as well
I'm moving weight from state-to-state
I gots to get my aconchelet(?)
I know the feds be watching me
But there ain't no way they stopping me

[Hook - Gucci Mane]

[Verse 2 - Young Buck]
Drop a pack off to my lawyer
Take these charges, overturn em
Roll the kush in my trial papers
And burn em - I'm not going
The fork in it and my Glock showing
If it don't shine then it's not glowing
Ain't mine if it's not foreign
Broke ho - bitch you not knowing!
They was rap touring I was behind the bus
With packs for em
Didn't plan on digging this up
But I need a shovel
Good looking, Gucci got me back
I'm trying to buy another
Pounds of mid and my college bitch's
House neighbors complaining about the smell
They got her kicked out
They popping down to the last pill
In Cashville

Sorry darling my rings on my feet I got a gator problem
Lizard fetish, reptiles on my feet I'm in the Gucci Section
Gucci Mane be stupid flexing like he got a new connection
Baby girl so stupid sexy she got me with a huge erection
Hit all that at the intersection

Public sex illegal but I bump you while we get arrested
Dime out, dime out, mine out, time out, your chick at the steak house

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

[Hook]

[Produced by Sounwave]

[Intro]
For the record, I used to do a lot of humping when I was little
I got a lot of whoopings over that shit too, and that's random, but so what? Ha-ha-ha

[Verse 1]
Gimme that beat fool, this a full time jack
No really this a Sounwave track
So really I ain't gotta steal nothing all I gotta do is kill it
When you press record button let the paralyzed feel it
I came back with a full time swag
And the critics thought they had me
Nah, I just bought more batteries
Turned up supercharged, a medium away from living large
Matter fact where my niggas at?
Where my bitches with them pretty weaves?
Enemies bleed on the maxi pad, pussy you fucked with the wrong one
I'm on one, I'll make sure your kids breathe pneumonia
Good kid, mad city evil in my heart
From the blood niggas fucking with me, crip niggas tryna kill me
Malcolm X mind state, if I raise the crime rate
It's a legitimate reason why
I put on repeat Kanye's "Touch the Sky"
But I'll be looking past that I'm tryna touch God
My heart to the heavens, the rebel of the reverend
Y'all married to the game well I'm 'bout to crash weddings
I put a lot of pain in the shit I write
If you going through something, this the shit you recite
This is bigger than life, this is Kendrick Lamar
This is Jimi Hendrix guitar on tour, bonjour, I mean war like that!
Yeah, straight like that

[Chorus]
People don't be shy
Release them balloons to the sky
I need the world to celebrate me! (One time)
You'll never know when I'm gone (Two times)

[Verse 2]
In 2010, I'm tryna ball, nigga!
Like shooting jumpshots in the mall, nigga!
That's a quote from Ab-Soul
I suppose since you laugh that's the ultimate goal
On behalf of the Top Dawg conglomerate, shall stay anonymous
Searching seven continents accomplishing big shit
Big ass, big tits she on me
And just to get to me she'll fuck the homies... homie's homies
The life of a cool nigga, my nigga Tony said
"Just do you, nigga!" Show and prove, nigga
And they gon' play you for a fool that's for sure
'til they know you got the stinkiest stool, nigga!"
I ain't tripping I'm just tipping on fo-fo's
Back in the city and tipping on four hoes
That boy got a cold cold, he's sick con, slick on
Dropin red jewels like a school bar mitzvah, ooh
Straight like that

[Chorus]
People don't be shy
Release them balloons to the sky
I need the world to celebrate me! (One time)
You'll never know when I'm gone (Two times)

[Verse 3]
Why y'all complain about OG's?
I don't look at a legend and say you owe me
Not Snoop, not Dre, not Ice Cube
I don't care me and Quik went to the same school
I look in the mirror and do it myself
Like a self made nigga, I don't need a maid, nigga
Do I need a co-sign from Dre or Jigga?
They can make me much bigger
But do I need 'em though?, I just need a flow
The type of shit that make you think you seen Pac ghost
"Me Against The World" on you mothafuckas
I got my back against the wall and a .45, dog get smoked, Chris Tucker
Uhh, tryna record my steelo
Even when I'm not there just like TiVo
The hoes tell me that I got a real big ego
And weed move slow right now but E go
You know what I'm talking 'bout? I look at your Audemars
To put ya'll in time out, it's time to unveil the real
And your career is about as frail as Ms. Winehouse
Just salute, grab a flute, and pull the wine out, ooh
Just like that

[Chorus]
People don't be shy
Release them balloons to the sky
I need the world to celebrate me! (One time)
You'll never know when I'm gone (Two times)

Yeah, uh

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
And I'll never let my son have an ego
He'll be nice to everyone wherever we go
I mean, I might even make him be Republican
So everybody know he love white people
And I'll never let him leave his college girlfriend
And get caught up with the groupies in the whirlwinds
And I'll never let him ever hit the telethon
I mean, even if people dyin' and the world ends
See, I just want him to have an easy life, not like Yeezy life
Just want him to be someone people like
Don't want him to be hated all the time, judged
Don't be like your daddy that'd never budge
And I'll never let him ever hit a strip club
I learned the hard way, that ain't the place to get love
And I'll never let his mom move to LA
Knowin' she couldn't take the pressure, now we all pray

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Sorry, junior, I already ruined ya
'Cause you ain't even alive, paparazzi pursuin' ya
Sins of a father make your life ten times harder
I just wanna take ya to a barber
Bondin' on charters, all the shit that I never did
Teach you good values so you cherish it
Took me twenty-six years to find my path
My only job is cut the time in half
So at thirteen, we'll have our first drink together
Black bar mitzvahs, mazel tov, mogul talk
Look a man dead in his eyes
So he know you talk truth when you speak it
Give your word, keep it
And if the day comes I only see him on the weekend
I just pray we was in love on the night that we conceived him
Promise to never leave him even if his mama tweakin'
'Cause my dad left me and I promise never repeat him
Never repeat him, never repeat him

[Outro: Nina Simone]
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel

(Yeah, yeah)
Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle, well

She turned around and looked at me and she said, "Alive"
Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle, well

[Verse 1: Jay-Z & Swizz Beatz]
Black Axl Rose, move halves and wholes (Right)
Come down to the jungle, just ask for Hov (Right)
Move blocks and squares, move apples and pears (Oh)
Work pots and pans just to cop me some Airs (Goddammit)
My uncle died, my daddy did too (Ayy)
Paralyzed by the pain, I can barely move
My nephew gone, my heart is torn
Sometimes I look to the sky, ask why I was born
My faith in God, every day is hard
Every night is worse, that's why I pray so hard

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Jay-Z]
Why I pray so hard, this is crazy, God
Just when I thought I had everything, I lost it all
So que será (Welcome to the jungle), get a case of Syrah
Let it chase the pain 'fore it goes too far (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z & Kanye West]
My dreams is big, reality set in (Huh)
Let off a clip from a automatic weapon (Yeah)
Through shots in the door, it died in Vegas
Though it fought so hard, I knew it wouldn't make it
I'm a tortured soul, I live in disguise
Rest in peace to the leader of the Jackson 5 (Ooh, woo)
I died in my sleep, I'm still Big Pimpin'
I ball at the mall, beginning of the ending (Yeah)
Where the fuck is the sun? It's been a while
Mama, look at your son, what happened to my smile?
My tears is tatted, my rag in my pocket
I'm just looking for love, I know somebody got it
Champagne for the pain, weed for the low
Goddamn, I'm so high, where the fuck did I go?
I'm losing myself, I'm stuck in the moment
I look in the mirror, my only opponent
Where the fuck is the press? Where the fuck is the pres'?
Either they know or don't care, I'm fucking depressed
No crying in public, just lying to judges
Riskin' my life, I'm already dying, so fuck it, well

[Outro: Swizz Beatz]
Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle, well
Goddammit

[Intro: Otis Redding & JAY-Z]
It makes it easier, easier to bear
You won't regret it, no, no, no
Some girls, they don't forget it
Love is their only happiness
Squee'— Squee'— Squee'—
(Sounds so soulful, don't you agree?)
Squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave her

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Uh, I invented swag
Poppin' bottles, puttin' supermodels in the cab
Proof
I guess I got my swagger back, truth
New watch alert, Hublots
Or the big-face Rollie, I got two of those
Arm out the window, through the city, I maneuver slow
Cock back, snapback, see my cut through the holes, Hov

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Damn, Yeezy and Hov, where the hell you been?
Niggas talking real reckless, stuntmen
I adopted these niggas, Phillip Drummond them
Now I'm 'bout to make 'em tuck they whole summer in
They say I'm crazy, well, I'm 'bout to go dumb again
They ain't seen me 'cause I pulled up in my other Benz
Last week, I was in my other, other Benz
Throw your diamonds up 'cause we in this bitch another 'gain

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Photoshoot fresh, looking like wealth
I'm 'bout to call the paparazzi on myself
Uh, live from the Mercer
Run up on Yeezy the wrong way, I might murk ya
Flee in the G450, I might surface
Political refugee, asylum can be purchased
Uh, everything's for sale
I got five passports, I'm never going to jail

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
I made "Jesus Walks," I'm never going to hell
Couture-level flow is never going on sale
Luxury rap, the Hermès of verses
Sophisticated ignorance, write my curses in cursive
I get it custom, you a customer
You ain't accustomed to going through customs, you ain't been nowhere, hah?
And all the ladies in the house got 'em showing off
I'm done, I'll hit you up maña— nah

[Verse 5: JAY-Z]
Welcome to Havana
Smoking Cubanos with Castro in cabanas
Viva México, Cubano
Dominicano, all the plugs that I know
Driving Benzes with no benefits
Not bad, huh, for some immigrants?
Build your fences, we diggin' tunnels
Can't you see we gettin' money up under you?

[Verse 6: Kanye West, Jay-Z & Both]
Can't you see the private jets flying over you?
Maybach bumper sticker read, "What would Hova do?"
Jay is chillin' (Uh), Ye is chillin' (Uh)
What more can I say? We killin' 'em
Hold up before we end this campaign
As you can see, we done bodied the damn lames
Lord, please let them accept the things they can't change
And pray that all of they pain be champagne

Scream it
Give it

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer
Who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive?
Alright, alright
No church in the wild

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the Colosseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rolling in the Rolls-Royce Corniche
Only the doctors got this, I'm hiding from police
Cocaine seats
All white like I got the whole thing bleached
Drug dealer chic
I'm wondering if a thug's prayers reach
Is Pius pious 'cause God loves pious?
Socrates asked whose bias do y'all seek?
All for Plato, screech
I'm out here balling, I know y'all hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats
Preach

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer
Who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive?
Alright, alright
No church in the wild

[Bridge: The-Dream]
I live by you, desire
I stand by you, walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
Let me in through your encryption
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Coke on her Black skin made it stripe like a zebra
I call that jungle fever
You will not control the threesome
Just roll the weed up until I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there's permission
And deception is the only felony
So never fuck nobody without telling me
Sunglasses and Advil
Last night was mad real
Sun coming up, 5 a.m.
I wonder if they got cabs still
Thinking 'bout the girl in all leopard
Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepard
Two tattoos, one read, "No apologies"
The other said, "Love is cursed by monogamy"
That's something that the pastor don't preach
That's something that a teacher can't teach
When we die, the money, we can't keep
But we'll probably spend it all 'cause the pain ain't cheap
Preach

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king?
What's a king to a god?
What's a god to a non-believer
Who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive?
Alright, alright
No church in the wild

No church in the wild
No church in the wild

I can't stop

This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the Lord
'Til I die, I'ma fuckin' ball
Now who gon' stop me? Who gon' stop me, huh?
Who gon' stop me? Who gon' stop me, huh?
Black cards, black cars, black on black, Black broads
Whole lotta money in a black bag
Black strap, you know what that's for

[Post-Chorus: JAY-Z, Kanye West & both]
Who gon' stop me, huh?
Who gon' stop me, huh?
Yeah, who gon' stop me?
No brakes, I need State Farm
So many watches, I need eight arms
One neck, but got eight charms
Who gon' stop me, huh?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Niggas talking, they bitch-made, ix-nay off my dicks-nay
That's Pig Latin, itch-bay, who gon' stop me, huh?
Last night ain't go so well, got kicked up out the hotel
Got a little freaky like Marvin Albert, yes, tell Howard Cosell
You just a commentator if you getting paper
Everybody I know from the hood got common haters
In some relations, you just supposed to say nothin'
Heard she fucked the doorman, well, that's cool, I fucked the waitress
Heard Yeezy was racist, well, I guess that's on one basis
I only like green faces

[Chorus: Kanye West & JAY-Z]
This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the Lord
'Til I die, I'ma fucking ball
Now who gon' stop me? Who gon' stop me, huh?
Who gon' stop me? Who gon' stop me, huh?

Whole lotta money in a black bag
Black strap, you know what that's for

Y'all weed purple, my money purple
Y'all Steve Urkel, I'm Oprah's circle
I wrote the verse that I hope'll hurt you (Yeah, yeah, let's go)

[Verse 2: JAY-Z & Kanye West]
Who gon' stop me, huh?
Beat the odds, beat the feds
It wouldn't be wise to bet against the kid
Start me broke, I bet I get rich
Night shift, six to six
Give me one shot, one pot
I'll show up in all white wearin' no socks
No ceiling, new coupe
They know I'm a dope boy, they don't have no proof
I'm three steps removed, I know how to move
It's looking like I don't know how to lose
I'm winning again, I'm at the Wynn
I'm at the table, I'm gamblin'
Lucky lefty, I expect a seven
I went through hell, I'm expectin' heaven
I'm owed, 'cause I'm dough, and I stuck to the G-code
I'm here, oh yeah, I promise I ain't goin' nowhere
Okay, here, like a hare, like a rabbit, I like karats
I'm allergic to havin' bunny ears, like broke, like nope
Like ha, I ain't no joke
I can't be stopped, like nope, like nope
Extend the beat, Noah (And pray to the Lord), uh

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Two seats in the 911, uh
No limit on the Black Card, uh
Told y'all I was gon' go H.A.M., uh
'Til the ocean was my backyard, uh
No lies in my verses, hey
Please pardon all the curses, hey
Shit gotta come in some way, fuck
When you growing up worthless, uh
Middle finger to my old life, uh
Special shoutout to my oldhead, uh
If it wasn't for your advice, uh
A nigga would have been so dead, uh
I'm living life 'til these niggas kill me
Turn this up if you niggas feel me
I'm riding dirty, tryna get filthy
Pablo Picasso, Rothkos, Rilkes
Graduated to the MoMA
And I did all of this without a diploma
Graduated from the corner
Y'all can play me for a motherfuckin' fool if you wanna
Street-smart and I'm book-smart
Could've been a chemist, 'cause I cook smart
Only thing can stop me is me, hey
And I'ma stop when the hook start, hold up

[Chorus: Kanye West & JAY-Z]
This is something like the Holocaust
Millions of our people lost
Bow our heads and pray to the Lord
'Til I die, I'ma fucking ball

Who gon' stop me? Who gon' stop me, huh?

Hello, hello, hello, hello, white America, assassinate my character
Money matrimony, yeah, they tryna break the marriage up
Who gon' act phony or who gon' try to embarrass ya?
I'ma need a day off, I think I'll call Ferris up
Bueller had a Muller, but I switched it for a Mille
'Cause I’m richer, and prior to this shit, was movin' free base
Had a conference with the DJs (Yeah?), Puerto Rico, three days
Poli with the PDs, now they got our shit on replay
Sorry I'm in pajamas, but I just got off the PJ
And last party we had, they shut down Prive
Ain't that where the Heat play? (Yup)
Niggas hate ballers these days (Yup)
Ain't that like LeBron James?

Who in that? Oh shit, it's just Blacks on Blacks on Blacks
Hundred stack, how you get it? Nigga, layin' raps on tracks
I wish I could give you this feeling, I'm planking on a million
I'm riding through your hood, you can bank I ain't got no ceiling
Made a left on Nostrand Ave, (Right), we in Bed-Stuy

[Part I: Murder]

[Intro: Jay Z]
Uh, bloody murder, murder, murder
Bloody murder, murder, murder, murder
Bloody murder, murder, murder, murder
Bloody murder, murder, murder

[Chorus: Kanye West & Jay Z]
Paper read, "Murder, Black-on-Black murder"
Paper read, "Murder, Black-on-Black murder" again (Uh)

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
This is to the memory of Danroy Henry
Too much enemy fire to catch a friendly
Strays from the same shade, nigga, we on the same team
Giving you respect, I expect the same thing, uh
All-black everything, nigga, you know my fresh code
I'm out here fighting for you, don't increase my stress load
Niggas watching the throne, very happy to be you
Power to the people, when you see me, see you

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
And I'm from the murder capital where they murder for capital
Heard about at least three killings this afternoon
Looking at the news like, "Damn, I was just with him after school"
No shop class, but half the school got a tool
And a "I could die any day"-type attitude
Plus his little brother got shot reppin' his avenue
It's time for us to stop and redefine Black power
Forty-one souls murdered in fifty hours

[Chorus: Kanye West]
The paper read, "Murder, Black-on-Black murder"
The paper read, "Murder, Black-on-Black murder" again
"Murder" again

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Is it genocide?
'Cause I can still hear his mama cries
Know the family traumatized
Shots left holes in his face about piranha-sized
The old pastor closed the cold casket
And said the church ain't got enough room for all the tombs
It's a war going on outside we ain't safe from
I feel the pain in my city wherever I go
314 soldiers died in Iraq, 509 died in Chicago

[Verse 4: Jay Z]
I arrived on the day Fred Hampton died, uh
Real niggas just multiply
And they say by 21, I was supposed to die
So I'm out here celebrating my post-demise
If you put crabs in a barrel to ensure your survival
You gon' end up pulling down niggas that look just like you
What up, Blood? Uh, what up, cuz? Uh, it's all Black, uh, I love us

[Chorus: Kanye West]
The paper read, "Murder, Black-on-Black murder"
The paper read, "Murder, Black-on-Black murder" again
"Black-on-Black murder" again
"Black-on-Black murder" again

[Part II: Excellence]

[Intro: Jay Z]
It's a celebration of Black excellence, black tie, black Maybachs
Huh, yeah, uh

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Black excellence, opulence, decadence
Tuxes next to the president, I'm present
I dress in Dries, and other boutique stores in Paris
In sheepskin coats, I silence the lambs
Do you know who I am, Clarice?
No cheap cologne whenever I "shh-shh"
Success never smelled so sweet
I stink of success, the new Black elite
They say my Black Card bear the mark of the beast
I repeat, my religion is the beat
My verse is like church, my Jesus piece
Now please, domino, domino
Only spot a few Blacks the higher I go, uh
What's up to Will? Uh, shout out to O, uh
That ain't enough, we gonna need a million more, uh
Kick in the door, uh, Biggie flow
I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go, uh

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Yeah, it's all messed up when it's nowhere to go
So we won't take the time out 'til we reach the T-O-P
From parolees that hold G's, sold keys, low keys
We like the promised land of the OG's
In the past if you picture events like a black tie
What the last thing you expect to see? Black guys
What's the life expectancy for Black guys?
The system's working effectively, that's why
I'll be a real man, take care of your son
Every problem you had before this day is now done
New crib, watch a movie
'Cause there ain't nothin' on the news but the blues
Hit the mall, pick up some Gucci
Now ain't nothing new but your shoes
Sunday morning, praise the Lord
You the girl that Jesus had been saving me for
So let's savor this moment and take it to the floor
Black excellence, truly yours
This for all my grinders world wide
Keep Your Head Up

I’m just a thug on the other side of the law
Raised in the hood, never thought I’d make it this far
I went from standing on the block dealing, totting my Glock
Weighing product on a triple beam
I even got hassled a lot, mainly by crooked cops
Life wasn’t easy as it seems!

Chorus:
Trying to make it in a city
Where we stay on the grind
Stay on the grind, stay on the grind
Trying to make it in a city
Where we stay on the grind
Stay on the grind, stay on the grind
Trying to make it in a city
Where we stay on the grind
Stay on the grind, stay on the grind
Trying to make it in a city
Where we stay on the grind
Stay on the grind, stay on the grind
Gets harder everyday to come up with the rent
And ain’t got a job (ain’t got a job)
Trying to keep the bills paid
But don’t wanna get locked up no more! (locked up no more)
See my Parolee Officer almost caught me with that stuff
Tossed it so he wouldn’t find a trace! (wouldn't find a trace)
Not to mention my baby mama, the bitch is greedy as fuck
Got child support steady on my case

Chorus:
Trying to make it in a city
Where we stay on the grind
Stay on the grind, stay on the grind
Trying to make it in a city
Where we stay on the grind
Stay on the grind, stay on the grind
Trying to make it in a city
Where we stay on the grind
Stay on the grind, stay on the grind
Trying to make it in a city
Where we stay on the grind
Stay on the grind, stay on the grind

Gotta a little personal but let me break it down
I’m not the only one out here that’s going through it now
It’s international, recession's all around
We gotta be here for each other when it hit the ground
I know your hurtin' (hurtin') and workin' (workin')
Don't give up it will all work out (work out)
Can’t ever stop hopin' (hopin'), for certain (certain)
I’ll be grinding until the day that I die!
Chorus:
Trying to make it in a city
Where we stay on the grind
Stay on the grind, stay on the grind
Trying to make it in a city
Where we stay on the grind
Stay on the grind, stay on the grind
Trying to make it in a city
Where we stay on the grind
Stay on the grind, stay on the grind
Trying to make it in a city
Where we stay on the grind
Stay on the grind, stay on the grind

[Verse 1]
Dead in the water, it's not a paid vacation
The sons and daughters of city officials attend demonstrations
It's hardly a sink or swim when all is well if the ticket sells

[Verse 2]
Out with a whimper, it's not a blaze of glory
You look down from your temple
As people endeavor to make it a story
And chisel a marble word, but all is lost if it's never heard

[Chorus 1]
But I've got someone to make reports
That tell me how my money's spent
To book my stays and draw my blinds
So I can't tell what's really there
And all I need's a great big congratulations

[Verse 3]
I'll keep your dreams, you pay attention for me
As strange as it seems, I'd rather dissolve than have you ignore me
The ground may be moving fast
But I tied my boots to a broken mast

[Verse 4]
The difference is clear, you throw it in your cauldron
Rust and veneer
Dusk and dawn, Steinways and Baldwins
You start with a simple stock of all the waste and salt to taste

[Chorus 2]
But damn my﻿ luck and damn these friends
That keep on combing back their smiles
I save my grace with half-assed guilt
And lay down the quilt upon the lawn
Spread my arms and soak up congratulations

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
This is a call to arms to live and love and sleep together
We could flood the streets with love or light or heat, whatever
Lock the parents out, cut a rug, twist and shout
Wave your hands, make it rain, the stars will rise again

[Chorus]
The youth are starting to change
Are you starting to change, are you?
Together, together, together, together
Together, together, together
The youth are starting to change
Are you starting to change, are you?
Together, together, together, together
Together, together, together

[Verse 2]
In a couple of years, tides have turned from boos to cheers
And in spite of the weather, we can learn to make it together

[Chorus]
The youth are starting to change
Are you starting to change, are you?
Together, together, together, together
Together, together, together
The youth are starting to change
Are you starting to change, are you?
Together, together, together, together
Together, together, together
Together, together, together, together
Together, together, together, together

[Chorus]
The youth are starting to change
Are you starting to change, are you?
Together, together, together, together
Together, together, together
The youth are starting to change
Are you starting to change, are you?
Together, together, together, together
Together, together, together
The youth are starting to change
Are you starting to change, are you?
Together, together, together, together
Together, together, together
The youth are starting to change
Are you starting to change, are you?
Together, together, together, together
Together, together, together

[Outro]
The youth

You a dead man
I get to poppin’ this bitch, watch where your head land
I ain't right, I swear to God, I need my head scanned
Stand up and eat that pussy while she on a headstand
I’m a dog, ho
Camo cargos, semi-auto
My bitch sniff more lines than a barcode, yeah!
Wish I could take a shot of Ciroc with Pac
Sorry for the wait, 'til my album drop

[Chorus]
They think that I'ma lose my mind out here
Ask me where I think I'll be this time next year
But I don't care, I'm livin' it up, I'm livin' it up, I'm livin' it up
Said I don't care, I'm li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-livin' it up (Hey, hey)

[Verse 1]
They wonder where I'm gon' be at
Posted with my chief sack
Seat back, keep this shit together like a knee cap
He's that bad motherfucker with a attitude
Haters try and play him, I ain't even gettin' mad at you
Fruity Judy spittin', but he rappin' like kiwi
I receive better than your satellite TV
Creepy, the rhymes that'll give 'em heebie-jeebies
Hoes showin' titties, tryna get a CD free
Please, grass stay together like it's welted
Turnin' down groupies, now they think I'm gettin' selfish
I'm not cocky, I'm just confident
Wave you off, move along, if you not convinced
Got way too much shit up on my shoppin' list
While you're broke, doin' coke, tryna copy Vince
Hop off the dick, let me be on my way
I don't pay attention, stay havin' good days, so

[Chorus]
They think that I'ma lose my mind out here
Ask me where I think I'll be this time next year
But I don't care, I'm livin' it up, I'm livin' it up, I'm livin' it up
Said I don't care, I'm li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-livin' it up (Hey, hey)

[Verse 2]
As I'm ridin' next to TreeJ (TreeJ), speedin' down the freeway
Headin' to the money, no pause, no delay
Racin' like a relay, hear me through the PA
Cheef 'til I'm sleepin', fuck the D-to-the-E-A
Uh, I'm in this game, no playin' for the pesos
Try and dip into this cheese like queso
Classes never seem to be there when they take role
I was runnin' to my dream, tryna make mo'
Music, make another song
They tell me they supported, they was hatin' all along
Love greater than the hate that I was gettin', didn't phase me for a second
So lately I've been gettin' kinda crazy, and I mention
To my lady when she stressin' that I'm cakin', it's a blessin'
I'm just tryna get her in the right direction
You want a war, then I'm comin' prepared
Most Dope, put ya thumb in the air, motherfucker

[Chorus]
They think that I'ma lose my mind out here
Ask me where I think I'll be this time next year
But I don't care, I'm livin' it up, I'm livin' it up, I'm livin' it up
Said I don't care, I'm li-li-li-li-li-li-li-li-livin' it up

[Outro]
"I think I'm having an overdose and so is my wife"
"Overdose of what?"
"Marijuana, I don't know if it had something in it, can you please send rescue?"
"Did you guys have fever or anything?"
"No I'm just, I think we're dying"
"How much did you guys have?"
"I don't know we made brownies..."
"And I think we're dead, time is going by really, really, really, really slow."

[Verse 1]
You said I'd never make it well I'm here
You told me I should go and sleep off the dreams
You promised I would stop having nightmares
If I could do my best to just not believe

[Pre-Hook]
Say I'm infatuated with my future
Too in love with tomorrow
And that tomorrow's a mystery that won't be solved
Tomorrow's a rolling stone that won't be home

[Hook]
Never dream that you tell me lies, lies, lies
Vicious lies looking me in my eyes, lies, lies
I'm running, I'm running as fast as my mind will let me
I'm running, I'm gunning, dream killers on the hunt for me
I'm running, I'm running, won't never let 'em get me
I'm running, I'm running, dream killer, dream killer killer

[Verse 2]
Villain with a dagger was chasing me
I woke up and you were standing right there
You kissed me and said that's just a bad one babe
Then I asked you what's that in your hand

[Pre-Hook]
You told me I'm infatuated with my future
Too in love with tomorrow
You say tomorrow's a mystery that won't be solved
Tomorrow's a rolling stone that won't be home

[Hook]
Never dream that you tell me lies, lies, lies
Vicious lies looking me in my eyes, lies, lies
I'm running, I'm running as fast as my mind will let me
I'm running, I'm gunning, dream killers on the hunt for me
I'm running, I'm running, won't never let 'em get me
I'm running, I'm running, dream killer, dream killer killer

[Bridge]
I'm gonna sleep good as soon as you're gone
But I can't dream good as long as long as

[Hook]
I'm running, I'm running as fast as my mind will let me
I'm running, I'm gunning, dream killers on the hunt for me
I'm running, I'm running, won't never let 'em get me
I'm running, I'm running, (dream killer, dream killer killer) x4

[Sample]
I want to describe my discovery in the simplest terms possible
Because it will reveal to you why it is true
That’s whatever the mind can deceive and believe
The mind can achieve
Regardless of how many times you may have failed in the past
Or off day your aims and hopes may be

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Go getter, with no cheddar
Just a white tee and a swap meet sweater
My life is likely to see great endeavors
But I can't win if I can't get it together
What I gotta do in order to see success?
Having the world's best to call me the best?
Pull up at the Grammy awards as the best dressed
With an address linked to a beautiful actress?
A dollar and a dream, I feel J. Cole
Word to the hole in my pocket and the hoes
That don't wanna fuck with a broke nigga with ambition
But the last time I checked, y'all was broke bitches
Make a name for myself then bubble like the ass of Buffy
When she wearing a tight belt
The homies on the block can say whatever they say
I don't wanna be a killer, I wanna be a Gates

[Chorus 1: Ash Riser]
In time, it'll come
Just stay focused and humble, my son
Show and prove, prove you're the one
It's not about who is dopest
Who wants it the most
So just go out and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it
Go out and get it

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
What I gotta do in order to see success?
Having the world's best to call me the best
Pull up at the Grammy awards as best dressed
With an address next to a beautiful actress
Do I gotta run in your spot and start blastin'
Better yet, rob the nearest Nix Check Cashing
Ear hustle on a nigga that's constantly braggin'
Catch him at the light, snatch him out his Jeep wagon
Or maybe I gotta hook up with Jose
Cop 5 bricks of the yay, head to the Bay
Area or carry the birds to VA
Let the Clipse distribute the work all day
Then come back home
Every three weeks flip three to six zones
Homies on the block can say whatever they want
I don't wanna be a dealer, I wanna be a Trump
Donald, that is

[Chorus 2: Ash Riser & Kendrick Lamar]
In time, it'll come
Just stay focused and humble, my son
Show and prove, prove you're the one
It's not about who is dopest
Who wants it the most
So just go out and get it
(And when I do I do it again
Then I go back
When I do I do it again
Then I go back
Thug it out)
Go out and get it
(But for now I'mma go head and doug it out
I gotta rhyme, rhyme)
Go out and get it
Go out and get it

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
So welcome to the story of my life
See I'm tryna get to get right off the shit that I write
Make a fortune, buy some Porsches for my momma and my wife
Pops engine in this old school run tiiight!
But as you listening to K-D-O-T
Man, me and my girl split the bucket of KFC
She listening to Drake and all I can say is "Damn
These niggas that much better than me, baby?"
I don't think this is meant to be
Cause I'm always losing self esteem
She paused the iPhone then said, "Huh?"
I repeated what I said then she replied, "Shut up."
You know you the best boy, you gotta keep doing it
But don't forget when you do, just keep you in it
And never listen to what the industry say
Don't be a typical artist, be more like Jay
Russell, Barry Gordy, Quincy Jones, Bob Johnson, Sean Combs, L.A. Reid
Young black entrepreneurs did what it took to succeed, yeah
So I gotta see success, I gotta make it off them Rosecrans steps
Rising to the top like a soda shook up
Bout to pop, and I'll pop on whoever's in my way

[Hook: 1]

Go out and get it
Go out and get it

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this!

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, I used to wanna be like Michael Jordan
Figured that I hit the NBA and make a fortune
Thank God for these rap recordings
I can ball like him on every verse and chorus
501s, Louis letterman jacket
Little brother only 5, momma put him on my taxes
You know that Compton ghetto shit
That every section 8 tenant is familiar with
Ooh wee, they say he something like the 70s
But I'm from '87, with a thousand dimes
You got 80 sevens
Gourmet sneakers, hair nappy
Fucking all my high school teachers
That was '05 bro
And I don't like 'em if the ass thin
And I don't wife 'em if a nigga is her best friend
The fuck I look like?
A million bucks, and that's why

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar]
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this!
Bitch, I do this!
Bitch, I do this!
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
She looking at the car like she wanna fuck it
She looking at the wrist like she wanna fuck it
Hating on her girlfriend just so I can fuck it
She say she on birth control, no I don't trust it (Ho)
Uh, So give me fifty feet champ
Run until I got a bunion and my feet cramp
I'm in the hot spot, I know they seats damp
And I don't need your cosign, that's a cheap stamp
You-you niggas check this cash and I'm GT crashing
105 off-ramp, hey
And little nigga got it going on, G5
Going, going, going, gone
Cloud 9 mind state
I drop a record then I raise the crime rate
Killing this shit, where's your funeral tie
A-B-C-D-E-F-G, fuck skip to Y

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar]
The homies say I'm the truest
The bitches think I'm the cutest
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this!
Bitch, I do this!
Bitch, I do this!
The definition what cool is
Boy, I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
She looking at the car like she wanna fuck it
She looking at the wrist like she wanna fuck it
Hating on her girlfriend just so I can fuck it
She say she on birth control, no I don't trust it
First off I'm a rider, bitch
Put them 26's on a Silverado, bitch
I keep my bitch with a finer bitch
Snap my fingers, she'll go find a bitch
Tell them fuck boys that I do this
Got the best product 'round town, Frank Lucas
Confuse 'em like a Rubix cube when I roll up
Ok, Subway bread like some cold cuts
And I drop cold cuts, bitches go crazy
Wild like a Haitian, I should set up shop in Haiti
Fuck you, pay me. Paper over pussy, nigga
When I drop you ain't getting paper nor pussy, nigga

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, I do this
Bitch, I do this
The definition of cool is
Boy I thought you knew this
Bitch, I do this

[Intro]
Smoke, Ty Beats
Better do it 'til we get right, uhh

[Bridge]
This is for my niggas getting high on the regular
This is for my bitches getting high on the regular

[Verse 1]
Purple drank, I still sip, purple weed blunt still lit
Real nigga, real bitch, purple swag, that trill shit
Them candy cars, I'm coming down, that paint drip, I still tip
That pimp shit, she ain't plan to fuck, I pick her up, I still hit
That's swag, bitch

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky + sample]
"I said"
Everything is purple (Swag)
Everything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)
"I said"
Everything is purple (Swag)
Everything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)

[Verse 2]
Purple swag, purple swag, I'm in the zone, I'm getting throwed
That purple swag, purple swag, that purple smoke up in my clothes
That big booty, juicy fruity, yellow bone, I wanna bone
I'm getting dome, I took her out, dick in her mouth, she getting on
I'm flexing steel, I'm flexing still, I'm sitting high, I'm tipping slow
I'm Texas trill, Texas trill, but in NY we spit it slow
I got these boppas going crazy, they see me coming
Robitussin, quit discussing, ASAP tell these niggas something, swag

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky + sample]
"I said"
Everything is purple (Swag)
Everything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)
"I said"
Everything is purple (Swag)
Everything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)
Oh, girl you blow my mind everytime that we're alone
Girl, let's do something new, baby tell me where you wanna go
So much opportunity, so many possibilities
I know when we be sexing cause you'll never know where we be sexing girl
I can't wait til you get off so I can put it on you
I've been thinking about you all day
You got that kind of love make a nigga wanna spend it on you
She ain't like them other girls, she ain't like them other girls
We be all up on the couch, we be all up on my dresser
We be all up in my bad, lil shorty ain't scared
We just do it anywhere..
In the backseat of my car, I know she don't mind
All up in your office, putting in that overtime
We just do it anywhere..

[Intro]
Hahahahahaha
Ayo, 50, what I tell you?
We ain't even have to say shit
They did it, haha

[Chorus]
Monkey see, monkey do
Don't ever make the first move, just let 'em come to you
'Cause they gon' always see and do what the other one do
So let 'em come to you, the rest'll just follow suit
Monkey see, monkey do
Tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum
If they really want it bad enough, well, then they gon' come
Now here they come like we expected, now we just set 'em up
Check-mate, motherfucker, game's over, we won
Tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum

[Verse]
It doesn't take much for me to raise such a stank up
When motherfuckers hate your guts
You ain't even gotta say much
For me to put a pen to a blank sheet of paper
Is like smearin' bloodstains with a paintbrush
I can’t explain what it is my brain does
But however it works, it's insane, it's plain nuts
And it ain't just my brain that’s dangerous
It’s a whole combination of things, it takes nuts
And I’m not afraid to raise the stakes up
I got a million bucks in the bank and eight trucks
For anybody who gets on a track and spanks us
I'm patiently waitin' for the day, I’m anxious
To see the look on your fake mugs when you thugs go bankrupt
You're drunk, you ain't tough
Whatever you drank must of just turned you into some gangstas
This is me talkin', motherfucker, this ain’t drugs
You wanna pop shit? Wake up then make up
Fuck that! It’s too late chump, now face up
I pray for the day that someone who spits
With the caliber that Nas and Jay does
Opens up his jaw to say somethin' or rattle my name off
Or rattle the first thing from the top of his brain off
So I can blow the fuckin' dust off of this chainsaw
Give him the surgery that he came for
'Til I peel the paint off, I never been shot
But I think me and 50 must've been cut from the same cloth
'Cause I've always came off like Ja's chain
When they tried to rush him and lost and came back
And gave him a watch in exchange for it
I don’t stop, only thing that I wait for
Is the day that I ain't gotta report to probate court
'Cause I'ma give you all a reason to hate more
'Cause I been holdin' my tongue 'til I got a sprained jaw
A lot of rappers on my list, it just ain’t Ja
And I'ma read that motherfucker off come April
You pussies think I went soft 'cause 8 Mile
When I come back, I’ll be shootin' more than just paintballs
Trust me

[Chorus]
Monkey see, monkey do
Don't ever make the first move, just let 'em come to you
'Cause they gon' always see and do what the other one do
So let 'em come to you, the rest'll just follow suit
Monkey see, monkey do
Tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum
If they really want it bad enough, well, then they gon' come
Now here they come like we expected, now we just set 'em up
Check-mate, motherfucker, game's over, we won
Tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum

[Outro]
Fucking dummies
This ain’t chess
You playin' motherfuckin' checkers
This shit is all day, man, it’s too easy
We playin' chess, you playin' checkers
You 'bout to get your motherfuckin' asses jumped
Fuckin' punks
And by the way
We ain’t just talkin' to one person
We talkin' to every-motherfuckin'-body who wants to bring it
'Cause we bring it into anybody who wants to bring it
So bring it
Don’t pick up the ball if you don’t wanna play, man
It’s all fucked up now
Fuck I’m s'posed to do now?
Huh?!
What the fuck I'm s'posed to do?!
Haha
Yo, we out

[Verse 1]
I got dreams of gleaming wings and Beamers
Cream so obscene
Ain't gotta clean my sneakers no mo'
A closet full of Polo
A pocket full of mo' dough
I'm knocking in the fo' door
Never stopping for the popo
I can't forget to send my momma to the Acapulco
You laugh what, can't a nigga dream big
A swimming pool, big screen, mint-green Benz
Me and Christina Milian with sixteen kids
Yeah, I joke but a nigga mean biz'
Lemme tell you how it is, nigga
I got this feeling man, a nigga finna hit the ceiling fan
Fayettevillain killing, fishing for that scrilla, reelin' in
I'm leaning
That mean I'm chilling
I'm feeling like Gilligan
Nigga what is this a barbecue?
So why the fuck you grilling then

[Verse 2]
If I'm back in the 'Ville, haters smack in they grills
Ladies like 'em; got that '80s Michael Jackson appeal
Homie curiosity, all these cats getting killed
Niggas caps gettin' peeled, for that cash niggas
Will run up on yo' ass in that mask flash and the steel
Niggas laugh when they steal
I just brag cause I'm real
Motherfucker I'm the shit
I pass gas when I feel
Shit is trash bag, it's all about the last laugh
Mad I got yo' girl turned over like a bad pass
She know I rap, so I ain't even have to bag that
Cash that? Probably not how I design rhymes
The dick got 'em singin'
I could get yo' dime signed
A Don Juan type armed with a strong pipe
I even put it on dykes
I'm smashing like it's Prom Night, bitch

[Verse 3]
You niggas must've got your marijuana laced
I know some magicians make you disappear without a trace
Out-of-state speedin' through New York with Carolina plates
I'm the God mother fucker, and how dare y'all try to hate
You'll never shine like me, you could wear your hottest Bapes
I'ma show y'all how to cake
I can tell your Prada's fake
I understand you think fly
But nigga you ain't got a cape
I understand you think you gangsta
Nigga you ain't shot a thing
Them niggas bring it to you point-blank range, ain't gotta aim
Yeah, you see some players shooting, but this shit is not a game
Badda boom, badda bang
Lot of goons, lot of lames
Old groupie-ass niggas like the clan
Tryna hang, yeah
By the way, since ninety-seven I been nice
I'm finna get it crackin' like fat niggas on thin ice, wooh
We've been the best since I stepped in
Bring a hooker to the muthafuckin Jets Inn
In the sack, break her back like a Redskin
Need the dough like I'm trying to get the bread thin
Tree to make the head spin
Every season play the corner like I'm Revis
Light Caesar, heavy bearded like I'm Jesus
New York City, Queens borough be the backdrop
I bring it back to all the benches, need a blacktop
Big things, see me moving like a Sasquatch
Money, I'm in pursuit, cuchillo inside the boot
Bitches are on display, give brain inside the coupe
Shift gears, that's with the left
Which means I'm on the right, get paid
By any means, you hold it, say goodnight kid

Two fingers hold the potion when I'm smoking
Slow motion, snatch a snapper out the ocean
In my lungs go the drugs like the red chief
Red leaf lettuce blood money on the bench seat
12 courses laid up on the long table
Aged wine got me spinning like a dreidel
For fly women use a condom cause it's fatal
Hazel eyed bitched always blazing up the basil
The red razor cut the features in your facial
Creep in Corona, bumping Fernando Villalona
Puffing cheeba in the street by the chimi corner
Tu no ta pa mi, muthafuckas are sloppy
Captain of the rap, you talking to papi
Up in Niagara Falls, make your wifey suck a
Bag of balls, it's sick, just like a Magic cough
Same person on camera or when the muthafuckin' camera off
Hash straight from the desert, can knock
A camel off, Sheep straight out of school
Let the hammers off. Off the boat shit
Whole cliques roll thick, no shit
Piss drunk and they smoke sticks
Not a word of English but
They hold the four-fifths
FILA jumpsuit, sandals, the whole shit
Young kids walking around, got the Desi in hand
Going "Boom Shakalaka!" like it's NBA Jam
Never speak to fuzz
Tap out the reefer, show him how
To use his sneakers, cuz
Roasted peppers, sweet tomatoes, heirloom
We on the beach, fresh Ceviche
We in Cancun, fly girly curly
Hair is getting read through
We in the shower give me head: shampoo
Swimming trunk, shoe accentuate the ankle
Eyes blue, put the children's money in the Banco
Giuseppe Franco, take the cash and tango
I'm straight stoned -sly, thank you
Bye, peace, one, fuck you

[Intro]
Yeah, Philly in this bitch!
Loso waddup?

[Verse 1]
I'm from a city where the skinny niggas ride
With a Semi .45, make the biggest niggas fold up, roll up
I dunn seen the realest niggas froze up
When that Mac squeezing hollows leave your back, leaking that
Decent if you want to, everytime I come through
Everybody whispering, talking what they gon' do
Hundred grand in straight cash don't make me put it on you
And have your own homies trying to swarm you, I'm sworn to
Riding with this Glock .40 and I got it on, too
They tell me to put it down, but they don't know what I'm going through
Niggas playing checkers, and this is chess
So what's a pawn to a king that nigga got his money right
You niggas on a hunger strike
When I was dead-broke, man I used to grind a hundred a night
A hundred a days selling white, I tell you it ain't nothing nice
I be going so hard, I don't see my son at night
Baby mama bitching, I'm just trying to get my young'un right
Started with a dollar, to a half a ticket
And I just signed my deal today for all you rapping niggas
Money ain't a joke, you see me laughing niggas?
All my goonies they ain't talking, they just clapping niggas
You gonna think my dog a roofer, brought a ladder with him
My other homie a mechanic, got his ratchet with him
And they shootin' for real, they shooting to kill
I got some homies upstate, they doin' a will
I remember niggas shooting for dear life
30 years on us, cops pulling the red lights
We riding with them hammers
Know a couple young'uns that died before their grandma
Trying to play with hammers
A lot of niggas fronted back when I was in the slammer
But, now I got that paper in, and I be going bananas
Like Tony the Montana, Nino and the Carter
Got me leaning even harder with this Nina in my cargoes
I can't meet em any farther if the niggas want the work
Tell em meet me out North, 20- something and Berks
Used to be with 50 niggas, 20 of em got murked
20 of them turned pussy, the other 10 put in work
Yeah! I'm screaming "this is the life"
If you ain't hoopin' then you whipping the white
Or either hitting the white
I talked to em try to give them advice
Niggas get left, they wasn't living too right
Yeah! Uh, niggas get left, they wasn't living too right
Y'all don't really hear me tho

[Verse 1]
'Ye would've said you're so "Amazing"
So how could you be so "Heartless," girl?
"Live Your Life," take T-I-M-E
"Day 'n' Night" just like Kid Cudi
You'll think of me, you will, oh
Drake would say that you're the "Best He Ever Had"
Rumors come and go but you keep in shadow
Everywhere you go it follows, can't understand, I still love you
(Watch the blogs talk about this one) Oh, oh

[Chorus]
Soon as I thought I found the right woman
There were other guys who thought the same thing about her
Like damn, you let me down, down, down
'Cause you're famous, girl, for breaking hearts
You're famous, girl, girl, girl (Girl)
You're famous, girl, girl, girl (Girl)
You're famous, girl, girl, girl (Girl)
Should've known you'd break my heart
That you would break my heart, heart, heart

[Verse 2]
Keri would've said my love "Knocks Her Down"
Keyshia would've told me I was "Sent From Heaven"
Sorry B, I don't wear no "Halo"
You were first to play the game though
Sorry, I bust the windows out your car
I might have cheated in the beginning
I was wrong for writing "Disturbia"
But I meant it in "Forever," we were 'posed to be together
And I can't let you go

[Chorus]
Soon as you thought you found the right man
There were other girls who thought the same thing about me
Like damn, I let you down, down, down
Yes, I'm famous, girl, for breaking hearts
I'm famous, girl, girl, girl (Girl)
I'm famous, girl, girl, girl (Girl)
I'm famous, girl, girl, girl (Girl)
Didn't know I'd break your heart
That I would break your heart, heart, heart
I'm famous, girl, girl, girl (Girl)
I'm famous, girl, girl, girl (Girl)
I'm famous, girl, girl, girl (Girl)
Didn't know I'd break your heart
That I would break your heart, heart, heart

[Bridge]
Many hearts we should've left unbroken
Empty words are better left unspoken
Too much pressure, I wish time was frozen
Seems we lost our way now
I hope you're happy being famous, girl

[Chorus]
You're famous, girl, girl, girl (Should've known that you would break my heart)
You're famous, girl, girl, girl (Should have known that you would leave me lonely)
You're famous, girl, girl, girl (Yeah)
Should've known you'd break my heart
That you would break my heart, heart, heart
(But then again I'm famous, girl)
I'm famous, girl, girl, girl (I've broken my share of hearts)
I'm famous, girl, girl, girl (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm famous, girl, girl, girl (Should've known from the start that we would break apart)
Didn't know I'd break your heart
That I would break your heart, heart, heart (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
Every night she walks right in my dreams
Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart

[Hook: Michael Jackson]
The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine, m-m-m
I know she's mine
Because the doggone girl is mine m-m-m

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
I don't understand the way you think
Saying that she's yours, not mine
Sending roses and your silly dreams
Really just a waste of time

[Hook: Paul McCartney]
Because she's mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine

[Verse 3: Michael + Paul]
I love you more than he
(Take you anywhere)
Well I love you endlessly
(Loving we will share)
So come and go with me
To one's town

[Bridge: Michael Jackson]
But we both cannot have her
So it's one or the other
And one day you'll discover
That she's my girl forever and ever

[Verse 4: Michael + Paul]
Don't build your hopes to be let down
'Cause I really feel it's time
I know she'll tell you I'm the one for her
'Cause she said I blow her mind

[Hook: Michael Jackson]
The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine

[Refrain: Michael + Paul]
She's mine, she's mine
No, no, no, she's mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
The girl is mine (mine, mine); yep, she's mine (mine, mine)
The girl is mine (mine, mine); yeah, she's mine (mine, mine)

[Hook: Michael Jackson]
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine

[Interlude: Michael + Paul]
Michael, we're not going to fight about this, okay?
Ha, ha, Paul, I think I told you I'm a lover, not a fighter
Eh, I've heard it all before, Michael
She told me that I'm her forever lover, you know, don't you remember?
Well, after loving me she said she couldn't love another
Is that what she said?
Yeah, she said it; you keep dreaming

[Outro: Michael + (Paul)]
(I don't believe it!) (Mine, mine)
(No, no, no) The girl is mine (Mine, mine, mine)
(No, mine) No, mine (Mine, mine)
(She's mine, mine, mine, mine, mine) (Mine, mine, mine)
'Cause the girl is mine
(No, the girl is mine) (Mine, mine)
The girl is mine (Mine, mine, mine)
(No, the girl is mine)
The girl is mine (Mine, mine)
(No, she's mine)

[Intro]
Yeah, uhm
Yeah, uh, excuse me?

[Verse 1]
Hi, my name is Bob and I work at my job
I make forty-some dollars a day
I used to be the man in my hometown
Until I started to lose my way
It all goes back to when I dropped outta school
Having fun, I was living the life
But now I got a problem with that little white rock
See. I can't put down the pipe

[Bridge]
And it is breaking me down, watching the world spin 'round
While my dreams fall down, is anybody out there?
It is breaking me down, no more friends around
And my dreams fall down, is anybody out there?

[Chorus]
Can anybody out there hear me?
'Cause I can't seem to hear myself
Can anybody out there see me?
'Cause I can't seem to see myself
There's gotta be a Heaven somewhere
Can you save me from this hell?
Can anybody out there feel me?
'Cause I can't seem to feel myself
Losing my way (Oh)
Keep losing my way (Oh)
Keep losing my way
Can you help me find my way?

[Verse 2]
Now you gotta understand I was a family man
I woulda done anything for my own
But I couldn't get a grip on my new found itch
So I ended up all alone
I remember where I was when I got my first buzz
See I thought I was living the life
And the craziest thing is I'll probably never know
The color of my daughter's eyes

[Bridge]
And it is breaking me down, watching the world spin 'round
While my dreams fall down, is anybody out there?
It is breaking me down, no more friends around
And my dreams fall down, is anybody out there?

[Chorus]
Can anybody out there hear me?
'Cause I can't seem to hear myself
Can anybody out there see me?
'Cause I can't seem to see myself
There's gotta be a Heaven somewhere
(There's gotta be a Heaven somewhere)
Can you save me from this hell? (Can you save me?)
Can anybody out there feel me?
'Cause I can't seem to feel myself
Losing my way (Yeah)
Keep losing my way (Losing my way)
Keep losing my way (Keep losing my way)
Can you help me find my way? (Oh, yeah, yeah)
Losing my way (Losing my way)
Keep losing my way (Keep losing my way)
Keep losing my way
So, can you help me find my way? Mm

[Interlude]
Oh my God, please forgive me (Father, hear me pray)
'Cause I know I've done some wrong in this life (This life)
If I could do it all again (Do it all again)
Have just one more chance, hey
To take all those wrongs and make them right, oh

[Chorus]
Can anybody out there hear me? (Oh)
'Cause I can't seem to hear myself  (Hey)
Can anybody out there see me? (Can anybody out there see me?)
'Cause I can't seem to see myself
There's gotta be a Heaven somewhere
(There's gotta be a Heaven somewhere)
Can you save me from this hell? (Hey)
Can anybody out there feel me? (feel me)
'Cause I can't seem to feel myself (feel me, hey)
Can anybody out there hear me? (Can anybody out there hear me?)
'Cause I can't seem to hear myself (I can't hear myself)
Can anybody out there see me?
'Cause I can't seem to see myself (I can't seem to see myself)
There's gotta be a heaven somewhere (There's gotta be a Heaven somewhere) (No, no, no)
Can you save me from this hell? (Can you save me from this hell?)
(Hey) Can anybody out there feel me?
'Cause I can't seem to feel myself (Losing my way)
Keep losing my way (Keep losing my way)
Keep losing my way (Keep losing my way)
Can you help me find my way?
Losing my way (Losing my way)
Keep losing my way (Keep losing my way)
Keep losing my way
So can you help me find my way?
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

[Verse 1]
Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby, they're tumblin' down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standin' in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

[Chorus]
Everywhere I'm lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

[Post-Chorus]
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo
Halo

[Verse 2]
Hit me like a ray of sun
Burnin' through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like fallin'
Gravity can't begin
To pull me back to the ground again

[Pre-Chorus]
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
The risk that I'm takin'
I'm never gonna shut you out

[Chorus]
Everywhere I'm lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

[Post-Chorus]
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo
Halo
Halo
Ooh

[Chorus]
Everywhere I'm lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby, I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away

[Post-Chorus]
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo
Halo, oh oh
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo

Young Money we the hardest team

Girl do your damn thing

[Verse 1: Jae Millz]
Okay, they say time is money and most say life is short
So I chase my dollar signs and let that bullshit walk
You in that bullshit
You might as well walk
I’m in the air first class
Pound key, can't talk sorry
Look in my eyes and you gonna see its a real nigga
No deck of cards nigga
I'll deal with you
I talk to the ghost of James Brown
It was a man's world then and its a man's world now
If you a fake nigga before then you a fake nigga now
Nothing change, same song
Same lyrics, same sound
Same shit different day
New problems every day
That revolver got that bang
That automaty just spray
Fuck games I don't play
Unless it's NBA 2k
Or that Madden
I ain't laughing
You next to pay
That's just Jae
Jae don’t think
Jae just go H.A.M
Before you could blink
You go get a drink
She wink next thing I know she's bent over my sink
Millz

[Refrain]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
It's Lil Tunechi
I ain't on shit, I was born Wayne
Wish I was born rich
Millz what it do
Where them New York bitches
If these walls could talk
I hope they talk business
And I got my money right
And since my money right
I can get some kidnappers
To go kidnap your son and wife
I dont pack a gun or knife
I pack a checkbook
And I just point guard
Russel Westbrook
On the real nigga
The clips got curves
That's sex appeal nigga
I’m extra ill, you
Pay the medical bill nigga
We masked up like there
Was a chemical spill nigga
Fuck with me e-y-e
Be damn if you will nigga
When we rolling we pop you
Like an extra pill nigga
Shoot to kill nigga
The truth will kill niggas
One time for Harlem
Two for Millz nigga, Tunechi
Digg man
My name is Slim
You know what I'm sayin?
My momma named me Charles
But the people, the people they call me Slim
And you know I been on this Kush and Orange Juice man
It's a wicked thang brotha
You know, I done been around, seen alot of faces
But my old lady, she won't, she won't roll my weed up for me man
I, I work so hard
I keep the bills paid up
Buy her things she can't pronounce
And she won't roll my trees jack
Jive man

Say dog
Its cold outside man, its cold
But you gotta stay cool
Everybody's fighting to get to the top
But me, I just wanna smoke and chill man
I just wanna smoke my weed brotha
Digg
Get us a nice lil place
Where nobody knows
Hell, I'll name my island if I could
Yea

[Refrain]
Up above the clouds, no one pullin' me down
Smokin', chillin', up at the top of the world
Up above the clouds, no one pullin' me down
Rollin', im G'in, feels like I'm dreamin', but it's just livin'

[Intro: Samples & MF DOOM]
I'll show the world, and more particularly those dim-witted, no-talent studio execs, that I— I'll prove that I'm the greatest soundman of all time!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm wit' it
He was a recording genius who invented this gizmo that turns bells into bombs, or something!
Wow. Gotta get outta the way of the soundwaves of those bells

[Verse]
Who got the most whips, gats and cash?
If you ask the villain, he say, "Who gives a rat's ass?"
Can't take it wit'choo you when you breathe your last
In the meaning in between "pass that grass"
Give thanks, his rank is that of big stank dank
He often time drank by the river bank
And kept a silver shank; for a calm cat
Always stayed strapped for hand-to-arm combat
For DOOM the bell tolls
Let them fools know ain't no more room in these hell holes
It's filled up to the brim with sold souls
Crackheads, dope fiends and 40s of ol' gold
Hold up, the boldest who ever sold it
Whoever dare roll up, prepare to get folded
Like Holly Hobbie, gosh golly gee
The back of Hector Hoskerish's trolly read "Wash me" (Ha, ha, ha, ha...)
Dagnabbit, the mask is like a chick magnet
Some'll let you stab it for a nic' of the babbit
They say he talk slick like Dick Cavett
A fiend for the mic and can't kick it like a sick habit (The bells)
Give him a hero's holla
Along wit' more free dough than Creflo Dollar
Holy Toledo, how he made base on The Today Show?
They say he wear a mask in case his face show
It's better than a stocking, birdbrain
Find him on the corner rockin' Mockingbird Lane
He's a odd man, Grandma
And she's a bad mamma-jamma; either squeeze the damn hammer
Or stop complainin', on the top he's remainin'
A lot of pop sensations need more proper home trainin'
The people say he's the nicest
He only wants to be left alone, to his own devices
If the price is right, he might sing a new smash
Then laugh 'n twist his Rollie Fingers moustache
Tear ya crew a new.. gash
And prepare a new batch of his own special herb goulash
Villain, the dork who talk funny
And'll put one in ya, so watch where you walk, money
Like Semy say, do more boomers, they cure tumors
And beware the Doomsta!

[Outro]
The bells toll for you! Ha, ha, ha, ha...

[Chorus: Big K.R.I.T.]
Don't you wanna rest that ass in this glass house
Don't, don't you wanna rest that ass in this glass house
Don't you wanna rest that ass in this glass house
If you ain't suckin' or fuckin' than get yo ass out

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Dash digital situation critical
Hate to make it so blatant baby
But I ain't playing
Maybe you got me confused
With one of them other dudes
I ain't none of them
Under they breath mumbling
Scared to tell them hoes what it is
You put yourself in that position
Out-chea with all that baller fishing
You fucked around and you caught a shark
Cold heart tear your feelings apart
I'm more focused on getting my rims powder-coated
One of the dopest, I'm schedule one
You just ibuprofen, what is you smoking?
Them bogus growers, they got you choking
The options open, you can hide with them suckas
Or ride low and get higher than a motherfucka!

[Chorus: Big K.R.I.T.]
Don't you wanna rest that ass in this glass house
Don't, don't you wanna rest that ass in this glass house
Don't you wanna rest that ass in this glass house
If you ain't suckin' or fuckin' than get yo ass out

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Straight stunting, sucka niggas I take from them
They bitches that is, get up in the car with Wiz
They know they gonna bake something, ain't frontin'
Smoking it all, the eighth onion
Get it twisted because you see me on your computer screen
Thinking because you got wireless you get as high as us
Bitches leaving they lame niggas to ride with us
Planes over everything in the fly we trust
Just by the smell it's obvious
That my connect come from Cali
I'm good long as the money piling up
All the while I'm just quick lane pimping
Big jane twisting
Walking how I talk it bitch that's Pittsburgh pimping

[Chorus: Big K.R.I.T.]
Don't you wanna rest that ass in this glass house
Don't, don't you wanna rest that ass in this glass house
Don't you wanna rest that ass in this glass house
If you ain't suckin' or fuckin' than get yo ass out

[Verse 3: Big K.R.I.T.]
Now I was candy-coated, bendin corners
5th, 5th wheelin' made a killin' with the bumper grill nd' chandelier cellin', plush linen
Is you fucking, is you sucking
I was wondering cuz if not
Don't be pushing on my buttons in my Cutlass
Unless you cuttin'
Bitch, I'm just saying
I ain't tricking is the reason that this porno flick playing
Trunk shaking knocking pictures off the wall
Southern mating call, 808 mean no draws
You got friends, I fuck em' all
What you mean you ain't nasty
Why the fuck you came
Just imagine what you got to do to get up in my plane
Mississippi pimp mouth piece frigid
Dolomite out of sight
Show you right, can you dig it, shawty?

[Chorus: Big K.R.I.T.]
Don't you wanna rest that ass in this glass house
Don't, don't you wanna rest that ass in this glass house
Don't you wanna rest that ass in this glass house
If you ain't suckin' or fuckin' than get yo ass out

[Verse 1: Nesby Phips]
Bone Snaps and crane kicks
Divine intervention, I was put here to change shit
By hook or Crooks and Castles draped up in the same fit
Been rockin' it for days now, and will until the pay stop
See there's no dinner or winner for second place huh?
Yea that what I figure, so I handle my business
Confidentiality, all my plans to get richer
Then I, master my role as my plan unfold
Right moves, make sure the left hand don't know
Words from a wiser predecessor: Never let up
I know how to spot a fool, cause he never shut up
If you speak it, you don't know it, you know it, you don't speak it
Can't feel me if you put your vertebrae on the speakers
See you got the beat, hitting at on ya
I got higher than Chong on bongs in California
Catch me in your in local cool spots catty corner
Virgins to the herb frown at that aroma
For those inquisitive, scoot closer to Phips a bit
I invite you to get higher than what you've experienced

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Um, there's some who think they smoke, but we stay higher
And some think they get fly, but we get flyer
They lookin' for the planes, we done cruised right by ya
Smell what I smoke, they ask me if I supply, I say no (Nooo)
It's everywhere we go

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Woke up in the mornin'
Some ashes in the sink, couple drinks we was pourin' in
My niggas sleep, bitches rollin weed while I'm yawnin'
It's just a routine after a night of performin'
I turn the hotel into a Polo Party
Makin' them eggs with cheese, let 'em smoke so much weed
Them hoes think we in the '70s
Big Dog, better pedigree, she in this king size bed with me
Give her space boy, I let her breathe
And I mean that technically
Roll up the trees, like my weed grown medically
Less of the seeds, Niggas still got the hatin' disease
When actually they know, bite or bark, fight or heart
I'ma keep rollin' trees nigga, light or spark
Taylor in my walk, karate in my Talk
Now that's gangsta

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Um, there's some who think they smoke, but we stay higher
And some think they get fly, but we get flyer
They lookin' for the planes, we done cruised right by ya
Smell what I smoke, they ask me if I supply, I say no (Nooo)
It's everywhere we go
I'ma uh
More places than I've ever been
More money that I could ever spend
More hotels than I could ever rent
More bitches than I could ever sleep with
More faces than I could ever know
More weed than I could ever blow
More fans front row at every show
And we go
I'm so high, so high
Up above the clouds, clouds
No one pulling me down, me down

Smoking, smoking
Chilling, chilling
Up at the top of the world, the world
Up above the clouds
No one pulling me down, me down
Growing, growing
We're cheating, cheating
Somebody dreaming
But you just living

[Intro: Chris Brown]

And she don't need no help, but I design her up
Juicy Couture no more, I Gucci sign her up

If you ain't careful, we take your bitch in the car with us
Front of the club, all my cars look like Toys "R" Us
Better hold your girl hand, she looking at Breezy, trust me
And the others want Big Sean Don
Got them black goons with me, call me Farrakhan
And when you see me, throw that Westside up
Don't get confused I'm from V.A. but give that Westside love, uh

Ok, come on, cars outside, hotels up the block
Jump in the ride, you and me for the rest of the night
It’s all good, click, turn off the lights
Pack it off like that girl, ooh, damn, that ass fat girl
We almost there baby, oh shit yeah baby, ow!

[Hook x2]

Level game oh, we heard no words are mistrired
Just enjoyin your work
Your salary lies on my shirt
9 to 5 I'm outta side outside
Out of border line (It's probaly sky)
Travelin super high
Oh there goes a fly super fly tyger guy
Young money getting every dolla righttttttt
We will not compromise who we are to be accepted by the crowd
We want substance in the place of popularity
We want to think our own thoughts
We want love, not lies
We want knowledge, understanding, and peace
We will not lose, because we are not losers
We are LASERS

[Verse]
I can't fuck with ho niggas, I can't trust these hoes neither
Wake up early in the mornin', eat that pussy like cold pizza
Hatin' ass nigga be baller blockin', actin' like some goalkeepers
There's a reason for everything, but my niggas kill for no reason
Camo shorts with a ho-beater, all-black hoodie, I'm Grim Reaper
Look like it's time for spring cleanin', brand-new spankin' street sweeper
Been in the game, I'm knee-deep, I like good head, I like good reefer
All my niggas strapped and ready to set it off: Queen Latifah
Got a chopper with a drum, split Swishers with my thumb
Get money like Donald Trump, double-barrel on that pump
This kush I got ain't no chump, get stupid and get stomped
Two guns, I call 'em Kris Kross, Kris Kross'll make you jump
Gotta do what a nigga gotta do, got goons, I ain't even gotta shoot
Got a bunch of bad bitches by the pool, I like my bitches in twos
Gotta go, I stick it and move, G-code, I stick to the rules
Last night I got so high I swear to God I went to the moon
I'm on that shit you can't get nowhere, you pussy boy, don't go there
If I don't do nothin' I'ma ball; no hair
Smokin' on that "Oh yeah," my niggas tote that hardware
What you 'bout, whoadie? My niggas 'bout that warfare
Real nigga since day one, 'cause I ain't promised day two
Throw that pussy at me, bitch, I think I'm Babe Ruth
Drop top Maybach on the way, yeah, that's that new Landaulet
She let me into her jungle, I'm gonna hit her with that rattlesnake
Guns clap like patty-cake, Blood gang red bandana face
Make them pussies pop they self, you can call that masturbate
I don't front, don't fabricate, I get high, I gravitate
Weezy F. Baby, bitch, the "F" is for Fascinate
Louisiana, I'm from that swamp, I'ma pull this bitch out and dump
Better run like Forrest Gump, fuck you and where you from
Three, two, I am the one, job well done
I ball 24/7, 3-6-5, twelve months
What's up Redbone? What's up Caramel?
Come to Wayne's World, it's a fairy tale
Yeah, I'm high, bitch; bitch, I parasail
Carter 4 is late, sorry for the wait

[Outro]
Thank you

[Intro]
G5 sittin' on the runway
Big-ass chopper, call that bitch "Beyoncé"

So they'll kill anyone for me, boy
Yeah, YMCMB, boy
Young Tunechi, fresh to death, Rest In Peace, boy

[Verse]
My gat bang, your hat hang, I ride off with Mack Maine

My Pa is the Birdman, I'm rich as a white man
I come to your show and kill you and your hype man
We rollin', let's roll out, my bitches don't hold out
They got Marley G, I gotta bond my lil bro out
Let my dreads grow out, my bitch got a blow out
Mi casa, su casa; my house is a ho house
Only fuck with real niggas, Polo, fuck that Hilfiger
Yeah, I'm on a pill, nigga, feed you to my lil niggas
Shout out to my big homies, Fee-Fee and T-Streets
Scope on that AK, make me take a sneak peek
T, roll another one, razor blade under tongue
You ain't never seen this watch, nigga, this a one of one
You niggas is Honey Bun, your girlfriend a ton of fun
Chopper with a drum, motherfucker, give the drummer some
Blunt fat like my blunt a thumb, suck a nigga dick or somethin'
Pop that pussy for me, then wild out and give my niggas some
I'ma do my thing, I put that on Nicki Minaj
I need a bad redbone to come give my dick a massage
I'm talkin' big money, I'm talkin' heavyweight
I cut down on the syrup, now I'm in better shape
I'm from New Orleans, nigga, where you ain't never safe
You fuck with me, I drop you off in front of Heaven gates
Okay, jump off a buildin', jump out a window
Smoke like a junkie and fuck like a nympho
Drink like a goldfish, that's right, you know this
Hold up; Click-clack! Okay, I'm reloaded
Fuck with Lil Tunechi, I'm good, I'm Gucci
Wild as Ryu, I hit you with that "Hadouken"
My money too long, nigga, my weed too strong, nigga
Fuck everybody, I'm in my own zone, nigga

[Chorus]
Uh, and every time you see me I'm wet
And I'm rollin', Tunechi, Rest In Peace, fresh to death
And I'm rollin', 'bout to fuck a bitch I just met
'Cause she rollin', nigga, we rollin', nigga, I'm rollin'
Gotta keep a towel, I'ma sweat
'Cause I'm rollin', goin' at a bitch nigga neck
'Cause I'm rollin', damn, ma, I ain't come yet
'Cause I'm rollin', bitch, I'm rollin'

[Outro]
Young Mula, baby
Sorry for the wait

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse]
Uh, let's get fucked up
On the road to riches, you're just a speed bump
Funny how the heater make a nigga freeze up
We smoke a tree down 'til it's just a tree stump
That Eastside nigga, bang on you bitches
I'm goin' at your neck, strangle you bitches
Got a long-ass list full of bad-ass bitches
And I stay burned out like a bad transmission
I'm on, like the lights, I light up
The kush, knock out, Tyson fights, I'm talkin' 'bout
Ass and titties, Sex and the City
Weezy F Baby and the 'F' is for "Forget it"
I'm lovin' my shine, sippin' on fine wine
Up in some fine dime, then she give me Einstein
Young Money, motherfucker, yeah, we picked a fine time
I'm a seventeen, nigga, bitch, I don't mind dyin', man
I just ended up on e'ry bitch's sex list
Genie in the bottle, get a motherfuckin' deathwish
Thugga in this bitch, he say, "Fuck y'all niggas"
Breakin' buds down the size of a football nigga
Red beam, gimme the light, no Sean Paul, nigga
Let Nina bust in your face, like a porn star, nigga
Yeah, I keep a Brian Pumper, no homo
The shit I'm on got the world movin' in slow-mo, man
I told Mack I was gon' do it
Above the law, but under the influence, man
I was on my skateboard, "Kick Push" swagger
Got my girl to the room, got behind her like a shadow

[Chorus]
I had her ass up in the air
I swear I got, swear I got the
Largest clip in the world right here in my gat
Yeah
And I wish a nigga play, I'ma bust a nigga ass
Hate Young Money? Then fuck you in the ass
187 and a hockey mask
Haha

Dana text me and say she wanna see me
Then sent a picture of her in the mirror

That dick make her walk crazy
And last time was awesome
All the lines, we crossed 'em
I ain't a killer, but don't push me
I O. J. Simpson that pussy
Ha, yeah, that's the shit
Pussy taste so good, make you smack your lips
I don't know about you, but I'm a beast with mine
She say she waitin' for the Carter 69, ha
Ha, I told her, "Sorry for the wait"
I value her time like an Audemars Piguet
And we gon' stay current like the water in a lake
Yeah, we gon' fuck around like we fuckin' in a circle
Ha, pardon the slur, that's the purple
It feels so real like it's virtual
Any kind of position, she's versatile
And she take it every way except personal, haha
Yeah, that's my bitch
Pussy wetter than a wishin' well, I wish
I was in it right now instead of makin' this song
Hut one, hut two, I run it in the end zone
Don't trip when I say I can't see ya
And she say she workin' on her career
Smoke got our eyes lookin' like we're from Korea
We floatin', but I'ma rock the boat like Aaliyah
RIP, shorty got me
And shorty knows I fucks with her, hard body
Shorty fine by me, spend some time by me
It's a jungle out there, come and climb my tree
I know what's on your mind, fine
Yeah, we can do whatever that is
She tell me that it's mine, I say, "Fine"
Shit, I was taught to live and let live
So go and live it up, baby, giddy-up, baby
It's your world, ain't tryna interrupt, but maybe
We movin' too fast, but, fuck it, let's crash
One day we gonna have to leave our love in the past
But for now it feel lovely, it feel great
I slide her: safe, ha
Yeah, yeah, all that good shit
No, I ain't a player, I just play it by the bullshit
I know what I'm doin', and she love how I do it
She throw that ass back and she never over-do it
Ha, she call me "baby" and I call her "bae"
Sorry for the wait, Carter 4 on the way
August 29

[Outro]
Hahahaha
Yeah
Fuck with me Drizzy
Gone (

[?])

[Verse 1: Thugga]
I pop some Percocets
Then I pop some Xanax
Sitting back strapped, cocked
Plotting on your man next
Jack a nigga for his work
Then stretch it like some Spandex
He hesitate, I spray and leave him
Like a Tampex - oops, I meant a Tampax
Bitch, I keep that anthrax
I can get your man wacked for a couple tan packs
Shoot off your Sedan Lac
Nigga, I demand stacks
I ain't playing black
Bitch, I be spraying Macks
All type of guns with accessories
I'm like Cosby for the bills
I need mills like Stephanie
Pussy niggas can't stand next to me
I've got dope and ecstasy
Keep em floating like both of the levees breached
Eighties baby but my soul from the seventies
Worldwide game like a traveled the seven seas
Niggas ain't OG, scary lil bitch, please
Put your pussy in the pan, Friskies

[Verse 2: Raw Dizzy]
I got ten up on my pinky ring and twenty on my bracelet
Now these niggas kissing ass, but they can't say shit
I'm just here to separate
The real from the fake shit
I told you, I was coming in
I'm sorry for the wait
I gotta get this money man
It's right here in my face
I got the Devil on my back
I don't wanna be up in that place
My grandmom tell me to be safe
I just keep running in these streets
I can't stop fucking with these hoes
When I say I'm just doing me
Bitch, I'm a Ninth Ward nigga
Mason street, D & G
That Florida right by the D
Need to free my nigga B
I ain't the type of person to be
Running from no beef, those fucking guns
Are gonna be bursting, knock somebody
Off their feet
So watch your fucking mouth
Before you end up on that floor and stop
Acting like you're hard cause
You know you've been a ho
I told you out the gate I'm not the fake
I gotta say, please excuse
Almost forgot man, I'm Raw Dizzy by the way

[Verse 3: Flow]
Money over bitches, bitch I'm coming for the check
Vampire living, bitch I'm coming for your neck
Raw, I'm sharp, my swagger like an X
I'm a motherfucking monster, I rap like I'm possessed
Call me Mr. Still Smoking, smoke it in a paper
The game is a bitch, hold that down and rape her
Yes I am a Blood but I be riding with my skaters
We probably smoking flavors bumping Tyler the Creator
I'm an Eastside native, all my niggas Soo Woop'n
They went brazy when they heard I had a song with Lil Tunechi
Bitch, get some ice and pour my Sprite
And light my bong and my doobies
Fuck your producer, I'm the one who be
Producing my music
I'm a hippie surrounded by a lot of pot
Cock the semi
Drop you like an Otterbox
They sleeping on me like I'm rapping with a blanket
Kill a nigga, have him thinking that he planking

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
All-red plaid shirt, skinny ass jeans on
Them goons at your front door, choppers out: "ding dong
Didn't I change the game and put my motherfucking team on
Now let my chopper ring, blaka is my ringtone
Fuck you ho-ass niggas, I get money and get over hoes
We hold court with them heaters, pop case open/closed
Looking for a bitch to hop up on my totem pole
And my blunt be stupid-fat, double-stuffed Oreos
I get loaded til I motherfucking overload
Been rapping, flows still tight like aerobic's clothes
Ask them bitches, I told em hoes
They back it up like Sonny drive in Bronx Tale, Calogero
Lighter in my pocket, light the sky rocket
Pull them hammers out and run them nigga's like stockings
Got some niggas from my city
Thugga, Dizzy, Flow
Sorry for the Wait, coming soon, Carter IV, beyotch

[Hook/Intro: Lil Wayne & Sample]
One big room full of bad bitches

[Verse 1]
Fuq' got the weed, Marl' got the gun
They say numbers don't lie; bitch, I'm not the one
Hammers in your face, this is not a dream
And you're getting every page of this magazine
Bumping UGK, talking about a murder
We roll a Dr. J and then we light that Julius Erving
I got pussy on the way and pussy on the way out
Life is a beach and these hoes trying to lay out
Tunechi, Tunechi, tote the toolie, fuck around and pop ya
My homies got that white girl, call it Lady Gaga!
Glock 4-tini, nina colada
Suck, swallow; semen, saliva
I am going at your collar; fuck you hoe niggas
Weezy go hard, you bitches go figure
Diamonds in my teeth like I'm a fucking dope dealer
You're a dead man walking: Michael Jackson, Thriller

[Hook: Lil Wayne & Sample]

One big room, full of bad...

[Verse 2]
Back where I started on my set, in black
All chrome Glock looking like a platinum plaque
We don't pack extra clips, we pack extra gats
And all my hoes dirty like welcome mats
'Til the wheels fall off; I can fix a flat
If you're scared, go to church and get a scripture tat
Guns the size of children; now, don't be childish
Be with wild-ass niggas, and I am the wildest
I'm a motherfucker; call me Weezy, baby
And on the end of the barrel, I got a sweet potato
My life is a movie, I got a leading lady
My rooftop drop back like Tom Brady
I got the world in my hands, skateboard and my Vans
And all my boys stay strapped like we live in Iran
I know what I can do, so, bitch, I do what I can
Dropped that Sorry 4 the Wait, man, I'm just saying

[Hook/Outro: Lil Wayne & Sample]

All right guys, um... (right motherfucker)
Look, I'm not gonna lie, some of you guys need extra credit (i don't nigga I'm smart)
It's the end of the semester, school's about to be out (fuck school, im dropping out)
And really, some of you guys aren't even passing, so.. (Nigga I gotta Z)
Today I'm going to give you guys a free write
You guys have 5 minutes to write about anything you want (fuck five, nigga)
So, uhh.. Get out a paper and pencil and get started.. (can I have a pen motherfucker?)

[Verse1]

Bass hit snaps yo back cracks front no football punt apple jacks no sin
Always out the motherfucking box, no in
Don’t have a religion, ignorant no sin
Begin my book first page no end
Talk to that piano no friends
We don’t try nigga, just natural
The mothafucking cloud feels good pterodactyl
Fuck tourrettes like pronouncing Tara backwards
Never been cool I just act natural
It’s a shame, mellow hype tame
Hodgy, Casey V, after that MellowHype came (Yes, sir)
And at heart we are all lames
At that brain we’re left and at this we’re best
I’m the teacher, so the students go ahead and test
Kinda like ninth grade when ugly bitches grew breasts
Kinda…..
I'm Waldo Find them soul, California rush I got a heart made of gold
At the end your bitch rainbow
Leprechaun I told that pussy did clove
I got a heart made of gold
Umm… I got a heart made of gold
Hey, yo, Domo, hit ‘em

[Verse2 Domo]:

I’m so 24 karat, heart made of gold
With subway lines dropping weight like Jared
Nigga I’m (arid?)
No stress bowflex get buff choke 'em till they go deaf
No rest switch teams and I’m still hot
Cuz everything I touch is golden
Jill Scott, pill pop
Swallow my stylow
Mr. Low Blow so ho lady me low
Explode all on your eardrums
Sex in that headphone about to make your ear cum
Here comes the Odd Future Rookie
Breaking niggas off like niggas share a cookie
Go book me I need to perform more
Cuz I’m raging like teenage hormones
And maybe a jail is what I board on
Cuz it’s death to any beat I record on
He got a heart made of gold
He got a heart made of gold

[Interlude]

Hey yo-shit-I’m half asleep and shit-fuck it yall

[Verse3 Tyler]:

Um… I’m ill, I’m sick, no lie I’m sick
I need my fucking meds
A cute Bitch that gives head
That only loves me for money
Didn't hear a fucking word I said
Gold digging
(Semi?) gold digging
Freestyles written, urine, shittin
Fuck it, pissing
Left Brain on the loop turn shit
No coupe it isn’t (turn it?)
That's cool
I’m living, smile every day
You wanna go away, I wanna go up
But how do I do that when I do not give a fuck
Let me rethink while I reheat up my lunch
In-fin
Stop, begin

[Verse4 Domo]:

One of a kind
A mile high stood out
Be raped, I went in and didn’t pull out
Mixtape is deaf, when it’s put out
I’m real, my down fall is what you should doubt
The Genesis, is winning shit
Need censorship, cuz I’m ignorant
Fuck a bee like I was intimate
My style is the new bitch
Get into it
(Back to Tyler the teacher)
Alright guys, time is up
Pass your papers and your pencils to the front
And uh… well, I guess free time
Hey Left Brain, put that piano away during class
Shit…. Fuck I need to quit

[Intro]
Ugh!
Twist made me do this
Paw-Paw in here with me, T in here with me
Ugh

[Verse]
Kush in the Swisher, money over bitches
Never kill a woman, unless she a witness
All about my business, survival of the fittest
She let me hide my weed in her titties
Bitch, I got the cash, in a rubberband
I got the Glock, already cocked, boom!
Fucking with a nigga, meet my motherfucking goons
Sorry 4 the Wait, Carter IV coming soon
Light it up, cause I’ma smoker
She tried to deepthroat, I fucked around and choked her
It’s Young Money, motherfucker, game over
Shots leave your body, looking like you doing yoga
And Lord knows I'm a sinner, pain pills for dinner
Bitch, I'm getting money like I got a money printer
Got a chopper and a trimmer, shooting like Jimmer
You coming in that water, boy, you better be a swimmer
I ain't worrying bout y’all, sitting on my Hog
While Miss Anita Baker sing "You Bringing Me Joy"
I came straight outta jail and did my thing on these boys
And we all yelled, “Fuck you, bitch!” and kept going
I'm on, and that’s right, baby
I ain't going out this bitch without a fight, baby
One request: please don’t bite, baby
I got some bomb-ass pussy from a white lady
I ain't lying, I’ma shine like a nickel or a diamond
I smoke a lot of weed to keep them bitches off of my mind
Girl, stop talking that shit
Go'n suck a nigga dick for a new outfit, hahaha
And even if the sky come falling
Bitch, I’ma still be high
I got faith in my weed man
My lil niggas got yay' by the bean bag
Hit ya ass from the side like a screen pass
And that red bandana is the team flag
Yeah, all up in your fucking face
Tez pushed the album back; sorry for the wait

[Outro]
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Uh-huh

[Intro]
Sorry for the wait, man
Album coming August 29th, though
Tez made me do this song

[Verse]
Ain’t nobody fuckin' with me
First-degree murder, you can get your degree, motherfucker
And you ain’t gotta wonder about me, Wonder Woman
Tune gon' ball, money tall, Paul Bunyan
Real nigga shit, pussy niggas gon' hate
Pound of the kush, call that bitch "pound cake"
I hit it from the back and make that bitch about-face
And then I gotta split, sorry, baby, sour grapes
She whine, "Baby, don't leave"
I duck that bullshit, bob and weave
Everybody trippin', but I ain’t never trippin'
Leave your ass flatter than my new television
I'm talkin' 'bout money and the power, power and the money
This shit is magic: Stan Van Gundy
I'ma run this shit 'til I'm the last man runnin'
Mack, light that shit, then pass that to me
Young Money, motherfucker, yeah, we that shit
Yeah, Weezy go hard like Cialis
Don't love that bitch, I fucked that ho
She pop X; I smoke O’s—tic-tac-toe
And I stink, 'cause I got a lot of shit on my mind
They say numbers don't lie—is that a 6 or a 9?
I stand in front of the clock, 'cause I'm ahead of the time
Knock your pussy ass off and send your head to your mom
I ain’t playin' with niggas, no, sir, not me
And they can’t blindfold what my third eye see
Yeah, I was locked up, but like a bird, I'm free
And the coupe transform, no Tyrese
Hello, goodbye, where are you, Wayne?
I’m somewhere in between joy and pain
And I reach for the stars, got stuck in the clouds
Got high as a bitch and left my love on the ground
Now, ain’t that 'bout a bitch? It ain’t never 'bout a bitch
I'll take your bitch and make her everybody bitch
Backed up by a bunch of G-ass niggas
And I just bought your girlfriend some kneepads, nigga
Ha, Eagle Street, where the real niggas hung
I'ma rep that shit 'til kingdom come
Yeah, $hort bring the drank, I bring the blunts
Fuckin' with me, it's blood, brains or guts, argh!
Fuck y'all, for real, though
Sleep with the hammer under the pillow
Get into the room, bend her over like her elbows
Soon as I’m done, peel off like velcro
Gone, baby, I'm stoned
Smokin' on the strong, got a huge-ass bong
Swag off the hook, you can’t use that phone
Stopped at the light and put my roof back on
Haha, one time for the G’s
The niggas got it locked, the niggas with the keys
The niggas on the block, the niggas on they P’s and Q’s
Put your bitch-ass on the evenin' news
Jumpin' in the game, better read the rules
High as a bitch, yeah, that's me on the moon
Fuck with me, die soon, not late
And I'm sorry for the motherfuckin' wait—Tunechi!

[Verse 1]
This right here
I'm about to re-kill
Cock it in yo ear
Resurrect and disappear
Bitch I'm bigger, you small
I be clowin' calls
And your just a funny guy, little duval
Bitch I'm a beast, man, dog
Licking the blood up off my paws
Filling my cup up, silly straw
7-Eleven, slurp me off
Put her beaver on my log
Then she lick lick like a frog
Pretty boy I'm not at all
I'm just way fresher than ya'll
Nigga damn, always talkin' to bitches not my age
Yea I'm young, you old, so put these babies on yo face
Tender love baby face
Say she want it everyday, but once I hit it it ain't the same
Ash-ley Mary Kate, haha
Oh shit full house it's a pool party
Heres the address use Google mami
Smell the Hermés
Or it's Bvlgari
Treat my bitches like assistants
Now you work for me
Spazz man
All about gettin' my cash fast
I'm totally rad, show her my tats
Flippin the bird, turnin' my back
No love, my heart will be back
Bury your tongue in my lap
I ain't even write shit after that
Okay look up bitch I'm flexin
Penthouse level leave you naked
Eat your heart out bitch I'm Jeffrey
Dahmer Damier my luggage
Lucky lefty I'm right handed
I'm crazy I'm just sayin
Nickles, dimes, quarters, grams
I don't smoke, this for Trell
Roll the L while we here
Plus the plane leaving in ten
I got models I got friends
But I never spend on them
Only circle that I'm in, is the circle of success
Fuck stress, have sex
And I do that shit the best, aww

[Verse 1: Drake]
Check, look
And I ain't tryna get to know nobody but you
Do me a favor tell me what's happenin'
I am drinkin' XO D is sippin' some Appleton
Usually the things I desire I always apprehend
Back again return of the mack again
'Deceiving' was cool I'll never record the track again
Even though my ex is fuckin' one of my rapper friends
I don't wanna seem like I am always attacking them verbally
You can stop frontin' I know you heard of me
Babygirl ya, ya, ya heard of me
Little me
Pay attention I guarantee you it'll be
One of the best, decisions you've made
I'm sonnin' them all I live in the shade
Previously mischievous behaviour was the leader of me
You could say I was fresh to some conceited degree
Steppin' out the house tryna figure out where cameras from Cheaters would be
But now I need a culprit
I am talkin Long Sands Beach, condo adult shit
I am talkin' all day shoppin' sprees in the mall with
Friends that I ball with
Hear me, Trey's girl? Go and get you some Fall shit
Sweetie I am a track's demise
I will kill this song 'til it actually dies
With a military jacket and some packed supplies
I won't say I'm the best 'til the stats arrive
And all these a-list parties you fraternize
Where you can't wear hats inside it's only slacks and ties
But you don't never act surprised
You just hold it down for your boy 'til the plaques arrive
And girl, I used to blow a couple thousand at the shake joint
Now it cost a couple thousand for a Drake joint
I gave up a lot to make a progress
I give it to you, and you take it the best

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
When I give ya what I give ya
(You gon' like that)
When I give ya what I give ya
(You throw it right back)
It ain't a women in the world that can doubt that (oh)
I need a women not a girl cause I'm bout that (oh no no)
And when I give ya what I give ya
(You gon' like that)
When I give ya what I give ya
(You throw it right back)
It ain't a women in the world that can doubt that (oh)
I need a women not a girl cause I'm bout that (oh no no)
And when I give ya what I give ya

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
(It's The Prince, look here)
Yup it's me again, Songz with a 'z' again
Canadian visitor, lady exhibitor
Play me I'll visit ya
Lay you in critical, condition
So don't get it twisted nigga
But back to the pimpin' nigga
Intercontinental you can catch me laid up
Somethin' with a fly face, slim waist, big butt
That's why I love what I does
Shot a couple videos now we got the city froze
Somethin' like my wrist be
Niggas know how this shit be
Step into the club security never frisk me
Buy so much liquor they give us a couple sips free
I be on Hennessy, straight, no cubes
Take me where the women be, I won't lose
Drake take Patrón to the face 'til he wasted
I'm blowin 'til I'm gon' outta space in the Matrix
Call me Mr. Anderson huh
I'm ramblin'
But at the same time I'm spittin' a flame rhyme
Baby what's your name? They call me the game mind
Most valuable player baby listen it's game time
We could take a couple shots break down ya d's
Take it to the hole post up on me
Let me fill the arena, I'll be Gilbert Arenas
Somethin' like a wizard when I give ya what I give ya

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
When I give ya what I give ya (You gon' like that)
When I give ya what I give ya (You throw it right back)
It ain't a woman in the world that can doubt that (oh)
I need a woman not a girl cause I'm bout that (oh no no)
And when I give ya what I give ya (You gon' like that)
When I give ya what I give ya (You throw it right back)
It ain't a woman in the world that can doubt that (oh)
I need a woman not a girl cause I'm bout that (oh no no)
And when I give ya what I give ya

[Intro: T.I.]
Feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now

[Hook: T.I.]
While these niggas run they mouth
I'mma run this city so feet don't fail me now
I never will stand still
I still run this here
Feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now

[Verse 1: T.I.]
It's the rap thespian, trap champion
Dude never lose even when you think he can't he win
Again, don't nobody do it like the kid do
Talkin' bout the greatest better throw him on the list too
Who way at the top even stopped dreamin'
Even in the offseason I'm steamin'
Hot, hurry up somebody better check our temperature
On the fire titan like the movie they remember us
Plus how can a nigga hate for real when resilience
The only thing matchin' my brilliance
Hahaha lol niggas kill me
Look mama no guns and I'm still G
Who'da thought from Baker Rows Center Hill, he
Get so much accomplished niggas plot to try to kill me
And keep it real we try yet and still we
Die out in the battle field but don't nobody feel me

[Hook: T.I.]
While these niggas run they mouth
I'mma run this city so feet don't fail me now
I never will stand still
I still run this here
Feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Yeah, sign yours sincerely
I been up on my game, really they just started listenin'
So when you talk about the greats you got to mention me
And if you're smellin' dro you know that I'm in the vicinity
Flawless with symmetry yeah, since elementary
Niggas bite the style like they tryna swap identities
Empty refrigerators all I see up in my memory
Now I'm in the club with complimentary Hennessy
But this a jungle so you hear the snakes slitherin'
These niggas fake like a face with no blemishes
So I'm movin' with the force of an Olympian
So cold with it you would think that I invented it
Yeah, I got a million ways to get it in
All day back and forth like tennis is
Another day at the office to handle business
From the beginning I sprinted knew where the finish is

[Hook: T.I.]
While these niggas run they mouth
I'mma run this city so feet don't fail me now
I never will stand still
I still run this here
Feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now

[Verse 3: Spodee]
I heard the T.I.P. I won’t, and shame on they ass
Since the presence is a gift I'mma refrain from the past
I'mma young stunner focused and ready to smash
Niggas on that sucka shit, boy they really appeared sad
If my feet don’t fail me I shall be crowned
But they never failed me before why would they fail now?
I’m the one to call on look how they carefully dial
Hoping they got the right number I hear the skeptical sounds
I made they ass I’m made to last
Niggas thinking that they on fire I deblaze they ass (I mean it)
I’m hopin you see it comparing me to rappers is silly
Them boys stale, packin up illys
And all my niggas packin the illy my fraction is gritty we large
The best kush the only reason I’m beggin' your pardon
Cats don’t know how to act in the presence of don's
I’m just bein a playa while they bitches enjoyin' my charm

[Hook: T.I.]
While these niggas run they mouth
I'mma run this city so feet don't fail me now
I never will stand still
I still run this here
Feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
All I ever wanted was lights, camera, action
People staring at night, cameras flashin'
Living the movie not prepared to see the last scene
All I want is the pretty women for the casting
Won't confront him, put your money where your mask is
You a chump, talk guns, but scared to blast his
Buy them bottles by the case, we don't gotta chase
For the love of money, we in a million dollar race
Windows done tinted, niggas hate em, but I fish bowl
So I can let your ho see me while I'm in it, yeah
See I ain't got a deal
But everybody know that I ain't kinda real
I'm hundred dollar bill authentic, yeah
Hotel room, marijuana's in it
Chevy watchin' the game, your bitch she rollin' me planes
Passport payin my dividence for the fame
Mind in the gutter, you niggas ain't in my lane
(Fool)

[Hook: Courtney Noelle]
This is not the life I chose, but it's the life that chose me
The money's got me everywhere that all these hoes be
And they can talk crazy cause they don't know me
Cause if you know me, I'm out here dreaming
The party hoes, the cars and clothes, living life is all I know
I found my lane and I won't change for nothing
There's only one way to go

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Now they cop the mixtapes and watch my videos
Maybe cause I got bars like a serial... code
Louie pouch full of pre-rolled
Mouth full of kush, mind on my zero
Hoes always thought I was cute but wouldn't speak though
Now they see me they be jocking on my steelo
On a private ride higher than a ski slope
I'm just flyin', haters try and cut my wings though, whoa
Now they see us and wanna be us
I'm partyin' poppin' bottles
With models to meet and greet us
Fuck her, follow, and then retweet us
In the sky, so my nigga keep up

[Bridge: Courtney Noelle & (Wiz Khalifa)]
I don't know where this road will go, cause my life is crazy (Fuckin' hoes, everywhere we go)
But I ain't changin', baby (This shit, you burn after you roll)

[Hook:]
This is not the life I chose, but it's the life that chose me
The money's got me everywhere that all these hoes be
And they can't talk crazy cause they don't know me
Cause if you know me, I'm out here dreaming
The party hoes, the cars and clothes, living like it's all I know
I found my lane and I won't change for nothing
There's only one way to go

[Intro: Gudda Gudda]
Mr. Hanky
Uh
Uh
Uh
Uh, yeah, okay

[Verse 1: Gudda Gudda]
I walk up in the club, Louis-Louis with the cherry bottoms
Bad bitch on my arm with a Halle Berry body
You know what I do, I get-get straight to the mula
Wrist-W-W-Wristwear frigid and my watch is a Franck Muller
I'm-I’m reppin’ Young Mula, G-Gudda times two, I
Remember when I used to stuff my paper in my shoebox
Now I got two large accounts where money stacks in large amounts
What the fuck you niggas talking 'bout? 'Cause we ain’t tryna talk it out
Pistol hangin’ out my jeans, it ain’t a thing, let's spark it out
Let that chopper start to sing and let it ring, and then I’m out
Yeah, you know what I’m sippin’, purple got me trippin’
Scoop your chicken up and let her lick me like a lizard
I’m on South Beach chillin’, and I’m tryna fuck e'ry hottie
Get her to the crib and make her fuck e'rybody
You know the team, it’s Young Money over e'rybody
In the rap game, so it’s, "Fuck e'rybody"

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Married to the mob, bury you alive
My girl pussy feel like Heaven to a God
And I came in this bitch with my niggas
Kidnap the baby and the fuckin’ babysitter, yeah
I be doin' me, don’t give a fuck 'bout what you doin'
Blood gang, bitch, big Bs, Boston Bruins
I could do this shit eyes-closed, nuttin’ to it
Bullets fuck your body up, they ain’t even tryna view it
I go tough, I go stupid
Murk your pussy ass and everyone you in cahoots wit'
Fuck you with a pool-stick, make you swallow toothpicks
Fuckin’ right we ruthless, we done watched too many movies
Done smoked too many doobies, murk you out, then deuces
We don’t know what truce is, that bulletproof vest so useless
Flag red like bruises, shoot at ya head with them uzis, I swear
Your honor, I ain’t a dealer, I’m a user, ya dig?
I load up the Sig, point it at ya wig
Pull over on the highway, throw you off the bridge
We don’t give a fuck, and we ain’t ever did
Shit, three words you never hear: let him live
I’m in my own zone; it got me throwed off
I break these bitches down; I break these hoes off
Lil Tunechi is my name; I got Gudda on the tape
Public apology, Sorry 4 the Wait, yeah
Holiday season!

[Verse 1]
I need a motherfucking translator
My plug is a Mexican
We talk so many numbers, we put
Numbers into sentences
15, 16, 17.5. Price too high? I won't buy
You can get a G off every key if
You go off the white. Im from dope city
North Memphis, nigga, look it up
38108 with pots and pans, we just
Cook it up. Them lame niggas try to
Imitate the swag, but the dope boys
Shit, I got a ?
The goons in your bushes
All the money in the world, man, I bet
You still a pussy
The hood's bilingual, the bitch is foreign
?, I just keep it going

[Gucci Mane]
The tats on my face tell my niggas where we be
The tats on my back show my bitches I'm a G
Translates to 1 + 2 = 3
1 key for you, and one pound for me
Translation, calculation, translation, calculation
Abbreviation: more money for me
More under the seat
Translation, calculation, translation, calculation
Abbreviation: more money for me
More under the seat

[Intro: DJ Khaled]
If you ain't talkin' money, we ain't talkin'
This is DJ Khaled, Lex Luger

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
I can’t even walk (Why?) my pockets too heavy
Got that .40 on me now (Why?) them choppers too heavy
Told him, "You gotta fall back, I can't sneak you in the club"
He said, "I'm in the car, you need me, my nigga?" Nothing but love
Now it's blunts everywhere, so much smoke, I can't see ya
Ain't over here, look, I wouldn't wanna be ya
Talking so many bitches, we got bitches on bitches
Way she moving that ass, I think the bitch got switches
Pull up to this bitch, Escalade full of killers

Wiz Khalifa's on the coupe, I'm talking black and yellow flapjacks

[Chorus: Jeezy]

Y'all just ballers on a budget (Fuck!) your money's on a diet
I'm laughing, you such a riot, David vs. your Goliath
Let my money talk for me, hear 'em (Shhh) be quiet
Hamilton said, "What's happenin'?" Jackson said, "What it do?"
Grant chucked up a deuce, my Benjamin said, "Fuck you!" (Ah)
It cost money to fund a war nigga (Ah)
I'll have you laying right on the floor nigga
And take you higher, I'm a lover, not a fighter
But if a rapper's gettin gassed then I'm the first with a lighter

[Chorus: Jeezy]
When I talk, I be talkin' 'bout money
So please don't talk to me if you ain’t talkin' 'bout money
Weed, blow, ecstasy, nah, we talkin' 'bout money

[Intro: DJ Khaled]
I am the streets, the future
I introduce you to Ace Hood, Meek Millz, Big Sean
Wale, Vado, this the future
They getting money, they making hit records
They hustling

[Verse 1: Ace Hood & DJ Khaled]
Okay now Khaled told me kill em (Kill em)
He just told me kill em (Kill em)
Hundred for the Beamer, kudos for the dealer
Murder bet I wrote her, kudos to the killer
Chevy sitting crooked, teeth on Reggie Miller
I'm a motherfucking beast, see me in your sleep
Nightmare on any street, swear I will murk any beat
Spread this to the industry, lyrics like the chopper piece
Flow right through your fitted T, pull this loot with chemistry
Hottest nigga 'round, they saying greatness is my tendency
No such thing as sympathy, more money my remedy
Pockets on Heavy D, bitch I'm hot, third degree
Whip I drive, owned by me, wrists and neck, anti-freeze
Can it be I'm who you dying to be?
Last of a dying breed, talking Siamese
Twin pistol shooter nigga like a 7B
Big dog getting it, you still on your pedigree
Yeah, fly nigga with some stupid swag
Dead faces keep my money in a body bag
And I'm G-U-T-T-A, hops in the whip and I gotta get paid
Fuck them bitches, ain't tryna get laid
Walk in my house you can meet my maid
Any given day you can push that Lac
Push that Benz on, push that 'Lade
Hopped in the whip, no top on mine
Niggas gonna hate, man fuck them guys
Real nigga shit, don't tell no lie
Private plane, my seat recline
Top ten charts where I reside
Got me a house, about to sign, nigga

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Meek Milly
We the motherfucking best, word to my mama
Ridin' presidential got me feeling like Obama
Cause all I want is change and my niggas they wanted the same
I wanted the money and never the fame
I turned into something they never became
Through all that rain, I kept my flame
And I kept burning and it's my turn and
Real nigga, my hood confirm it, now it's 6-2's on closed curtains
And that Maybach, let me take 'em way back, when I was starving
Now it's payback, nigga where that cake at? Murder all your artists
And I, I, I, I can feel that love, I can feel that hate
When I got that drum, I just feel so safe
I put it to your mug and it ain’t gonna wait
From this lil '08 when that thing gon fly
Got a little kick but it ain't no tired
Niggas talk murder but they ain't gon ride
Now we going hard like I ain't gonna die
Meek Mill

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Boi, boi, do it, okay, okay, smoke until I ain't got no lungs
Got her going down, no teeth, I call it speaking tongues
(Do it, do it) Now you speaking my language
From when they twist and talk with they fingers
Man but this ain't no sign language
Just fresh out of the ashes, this a Detroit fucking classic
From when MM got the masses, and Trick Trick got them passes
Bitch I'm from the Motor, Motor, yeah, that motor be the fastest
Bitch, they call it Motor City cause you're most likely to crash
Fuck it, good thing I got a chauffeur (Chaffeur)
Going broke? (Going broke?) No sir (No sir)
Bitch I'm the rap game stylist (Boi)
Cause I gave the rap game style, bitch
But I overshine, ain't no niggas over Sean
Toll rollin' five quarters so I guess we going overtime
'Til we dumb high (Dumb high) dumb high (Dumb high)
Westside, bitch I run mine
I'm rolling around in my old school, I feel like the alumni
Fuckin' hoes, no strings attached
So don't ask me why they strung out
I'm like Jordan to you niggas, I might even stick my tongue out
She wiggled and wobble, bobbled then landed on my throttle
Bitch, I might make you my baby and even buy you a bottle
Your niggas don’t ask how the top feel
When you keep 'em right beside you
My pockets got paper on paper, this shit just look like a novel
Boi, hundred thousand worth of ice on me now
But it don't feel half as good as grandma saying she proud

[Verse 4: Wale]
Forever dedicated, Maybach poetic genius
Some think they close to seein' me, tell 'em they close to Stevie
You poser niggas ain't 'posed to be here, we don't believe ya
Double MG up, we put a wreath on niggas' career
We the best, Khaled, no need to stress, Khaled
Know there's a lot of artists, but I got the best palette
Multiple colors, my mind is more productive than others
Married to Winnie, he think he really Nelson Mandela
That's fire though, one time for the 305 though
That hydro make me tired, yo, my kick game be so Tae-Bo
My balance be so tight rope, that's hard to find, Quick Tri-Flow
Can't fuck with me, that dyke flow, hoes blow for me, I maestro
Shit, that white whip sit like a slight wrist slit
Suicide shit, you can by shit if you write this shit
Nigga and right this minute, they say I'm buzzing hard
My driver's out of this world, you playing bumper cars
You niggas under cars, you should be unemployed
All you smokers Reggie, I'm in the telly, bunch of noise
Who gon' tell me that I ain't going or I ain't flowing?
Young Folarin, you see them 'puters, that was my influence

[Verse 5: Vado]
The Towers fell (Uh-huh), turned to Ground Zero
Kids ain't like Reggie Jackson, Nicki Barnes their hero
As I play Rothstein, Corleone like Bob De Niro
Been through it, we're here though, don't move with the weirdos (Woo)
Dress pimp, make a toast like, "Let's win"
Penthouse is on West and Fourth, pipes and MAC-6
While we in a Maserati brickin' his best friends
When I die, tell 'em to turn my coffin to stretch Benz (Just like this)
Rims on it, problems, my mans on it (I see em')
See him, we stomp him out, his mouth, our Timbs on it (Yes)
Always smoking an ounce amount, no tens on it (No)
Spins on it, you have no clout depends on it (What)
What the fiends say, few roaches you need spray
On tours, we straight, making sure lawyer fees paid (I got em')
Get the bills due, Mildew SRT-8
Charcoal seats gray, drop tops like release dates
Vado

[Hook x4]
How can something so right, go so wrong

[Verse 1]
I used to love her, fuck it, I still do
Cause love never die, but it can kill you
I pray to Heaven's sky, that it never kill me
It can get you real weak, but fuck it I'm a little G
My baby girl thought I was fucking every little freak
But darling, I was raised by a woman, that ain't the real me
Still, she managed to to spill out a little me
Watched the doctors wipe the blood, from her little feet
And goddamn she resembles me
She's my forgiveness for every sin and penalty living in me
She should be living with me
But what am I to do when her mother disagree?
I do me, but...

[Hook x8]

[Verse 2]
I even took your hand, and walked down the aisle
It takes a strong man, to do that young and wild
Look at your wedding band, that's 17 thou
But still she took the stand, now I pay for my child
And there comes divorce, mama I had to file
And as sad as it sounds, mama, I'm happy now
And my other girl got a new baby daddy now
And retaliation hurts, she getting married now
And when I lay down to sleep, I feel like I have died, I can be carried out
And buried now
But hear me now, I am here and now
So appealing 'til I disappear, but still, it got me feelin' like...

[Hook x4]

[Verse 3]
I'm in my early 20s, now all the ladies dig me
They like that baby face, they like the Baby in me
That's why it's Weezy Baby, and please say the baby
You know that nigga baby, yeah, he done paid me crazy
I won a few Source awards, I haven't won an a Oscar
So I don't know how to act, like my sweet ain't sour
So I run to my mama
She let me smoke and fret about my drama, then give me power
I'm a go and use all my knowledge and get acknowledged
If the pro tools stop recording, I'm still ballin'
I know you probably don't care about where my heart is
But just to let you know, it's where yours is
But...

[Hook x4]

[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Believe that, it's DJ Khaled
It's that We The Best, YMCMB
We The Best Forever

[Hook: Kevin Rudolf]
A million lights and a kick drum
The floor is moving slow
I've got a feeling 'bout this one
And we still young, you know, oh, oh?
I'm breathing fire in your club
It's not my fault if your heart's, grown, cold
It's not my fault if your heart's, grown, cold

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Uhh, new Hermes duffle bags
On the plane, see the sky through a little glass
20 hour flight, never jet-lagged
Sipping white wine, watching the sunset
Real love this close I ain't never had
Sitting with you all day 'til the night pass
Damn, damn, ain't tryna fight that
But if we fall too fast, will the feeling last?
Now I'm looking over my shoulder
Shoulder, uhh
Champagne, good dimes and good times
And now it's all over
But can't blame me for all that
You was bright, now your heart all black
Tryna outshine the good with the bad
You a cold muh'fucker, I ain't mad at you
Hah, I'm still shining

[Hook: Kevin Rudolf & Mack Maine]
A million lights and a kick drum
The floor is moving slow

[Verse 2: Mack Maine & Jae Millz]
Okay, you getting old and your heart turn cold
Timeline froze, mad at the world
Cause you lived your life but this the life that we chose
Lights on the road for the nicest Rolls
I mean long ass flights for these trifling hoes
But we don't crap out when the dice is rolled
I mean no life, low life
Say my name and hopes to get more life, nigga live your life
Lame ass nigga, you cook it with no spice
Lil B sacrifice, show me what your ho like
Hit her with that dope dick, now she's a dope fiend
Leo Lion the king, I'm looking for a dope queen
A First Lady baby, Young Money's Barack
Baggy cargos, high mismatched socks
Me, Gunz, Millz, Tyga, we give em the chills (Millzy!)
Weak riders get birth control pills, Young Money

[Verse 3: Jae Millz]
Uhh, bright lights
Lord knows I live for these nights
You're damn right
I'ma sip champagne 'til it blur my sight
Yanks fitted cap to the front like Jeter
And my diamonds ain't fierce like an episode of Cheaters, Jesus
Loud jewelry, loud speakers
Blowing loud weed with some loud divas
Millz!

[Hook: Kevin Rudolf & Cory Gunz]
A million lights and a kick drum
The floor is moving slow
I've got a feeling 'bout this one
And we still young, you know, oh, oh?
I'm breathing fire in your club
It's not my fault if your heart's, grown, cold
It's not my fault if your heart's, grown, cold
Young Money, Cash Money, We The Best, Khaled

[Verse 4: Cory Gunz]
Uh, it's that summertime money time
Gonna rhyme good time, want a dime, gimme mine
Loud smoke, quiet engine out the city line
Pretty toes hanging out the window to the finish line
Spikes poking out my kicks like a porcupine
Young Money, Cash Money, We The Best, fall in line
Uptown thoroughbreded from the South Bronx
Hot blocks in Miami, Khaled outcome
You made us, they hate us, just to say the latest
Life nothing like a movie, I just day-to-day this
Remember it was hard tryna pay his wages
Now he spitting hard rhymes on the main stages
Independent, yeah I told 'em, "Major later"
We some independent niggas getting major paper
Shout Tune, Stunna, Slim, Mack
We play for keep shorty, how we gon' give up that
YMCMB, lights, camera, action!

[Hook: Kevin Rudolf]
A million lights and a kick drum
The floor is moving slow
I've got a feeling 'bout this one
And we still young, you know, oh, oh?
I'm breathing fire in your club
It's not my fault if your heart's, grown, cold
It's not my fault if your heart's, grown, cold

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I watch how the moon sits in the sky in the dark night
Shining with the light from the sun
The sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming
The moon's gonna owe it one
It makes me think of how you act to me
You do favors, then rapidly
Just turn around and start askin' me about
Things that you want back from me

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you actin' like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Maybe someday, I'll be just like you and
Step on people like you do and
Run away all the people I thought I knew
I remember back then who you were
You used to be calm, used to be strong
Used to be generous, but you shoulda known
That you'd wear out your welcome
And now, you see how quiet it is all alone

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you actin' like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest
I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you actin' like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

[Interlude: Chester Bennington]
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
I wanna be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

[Outro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Stay away
I am so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger (Stay)
Sick of you actin' like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed (A)
While I find a place to rest
I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger (Way)
Sick of you actin' like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed (Stay away from me)
While I find a place to rest

Hundred thousand poppin' bottles, bitch we goin' in
Crystal lights, blowin' on that Khaled dro

Rainbow, red bone with the triple color

Sticks on deck, Stunna island, private jets
(Na, na-na, no, no, no)
Put the house on Gin, and nigga we place the bet
From hundred G's to flippin' hundred, bitch we hit the liq'
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
High on the hill, the view above the falls
Smashin' in the field, 100 balls home
You know how we do it, bossin' up, brand new
(Hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah, okay)
Uptown survivor, money ready to shoot

[Chorus: T-Pain]
You know I can't stop (can't stop), I won't stop (I won't stop)
I feel like everybody's trying to kill me
So I don't stop (stop), 'till I'm on top (top)
And God keeps telling me I will be
If you feel to lose, you know what to do
You know what to do - put your hands up in the air

Police kicked my door and shorty last night
I'd be damned if I don't go out without a fight
My girlfriend says she needs some new shoes in a bag
I tell her shut the fuck up and get off yo ass (Brick Squad)
I'm thuggin', I'm thuggin'

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
God bless a niggas soul, bitch I'm out here
Wear the wrong color, you can't come around here
So get your mind right, and keep your pistol close
Hoppin' out that ride out into your face, just like a seminal
I'm a nigga, stay thuggin', my lil' cousin got his chopper chrome
And a nigga want problems, take your top off like a metro dome
And make a loud noises, sound like it's world war
And never break a sweat, that's what them killers for
I get money ho, on some real shit
Deck 100's on me, that's just what I deal with
Waka's thugged out, and we the business
See me fuck the hammer, bet your niggas feel quick
Mama pray for me, commit a lot of sins
And it don't make it better consumin' a lot of gin
Blood, sweat & tears, I put my soul out
Smell the flowers, bitch, I might just pull the rose out

[Chorus: Waka Flocka]

Hands in the air, throw your hood up
Hoppin' off that 7 trey sixes when I pull up
Now where my bad bitches, who keep that ass fat?
I love a hood bitch, ain't scared to throw that ass back
And I keep them real niggas, homie that's that
You a super duck, I'm talkin' Aflac
My niggas stormed out, stormed out
Stupid dress in them zones with that stone mouth (Bow)

Catch you sniffin' by yourself, and then you assed out (Brrt)
And homie that's word, my niggas gon' learn
See that red in blue, I'm runnin' out my Converse

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
See there's a big difference
Between the star life, and your life
Me, I live the star life
You smell it when I come through

[Chorus: Johnny Juliano]
When I come through watch me put my game on
Fresh from my head down, big ass chain on
This my life and stars shine bright
Yeah I am a star, look inside my car
They know who I am I'm seeing 'em from afar
Don't act like you know, I know just who you are
Admit it or you don't cause baby I'm a star

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah
And you know that, but you can't stand it
Out of this world I'm from a different planet
See how I landed?, big ol' chain on
Tight ass white tee, black chuck tays on
I make great songs, my shit classic
See ya'll CD, walk right past it
Call me acid that's how I do ya'll
Heat niggas up till I can see right through ya'll
Never slipped out, goons right by me
Hear niggas talk shit but they don't try me
Can't do front door, don't got I.D
Straight up the elevator to the V.I.P
Drink my drink up, blow my weed smoke
Bitch don't say shit, let my team poke
Bout my money, you see me grinding
There go a hater, you see me shinin'?

[Chorus: Johnny Juliano]
When I come through watch me put my game on
Fresh from my head down, big ass chain on
This my life and stars shine bright
Yeah I am a star, look inside my car
They know who I am I'm seeing 'em from afar
Don't act like you know, I know just who you are
Admit it or you don't cause baby I'm a star

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Rocks in my charm look like boulders
Young and rich so my hoes much older
Me I'm cleaned up, tats all over
Know I'm getting it. home girl told her
No not sober, need my weed lit
Keep my blunt rolled, ain't no secret
Blow like 3 zips, me and po run
Brand new Guccis, big ass chain on
Where my plane goin'? down Miami
Sun gon' tan me, palm trees fan me
Takin pictures where my fans be
Niggas sit down, they can't stand me
Straight from the Burgh', taylor gang my family
Hustle heavy that's why we cakin
Get my shine on that's why they hatin
As soon as I pull up ya'll can't say shit

[Chorus: Johnny Juliano]
When I come through watch me put my game on
Fresh from my head down, big ass chain on
This my life and stars shine bright
Yeah I am a star, look inside my car
They know who I am I'm seeing 'em from afar
Don't act like you know, I know just who you are
Admit it or you don't cause baby I'm a star

[Verse 1]
I don't know why
But it's like I can't stay quiet
This is my voice
I can't let it die inside me
See I'll be scared if there wasn't a riot
Pushing and pulling, grabbing some hair
Puking and fucking up the sidewalk
This battle makes it interesting
I abide desires
Like a dog pissing on the hydrant
Just to spite the fire
It's not to be taken lightly
The page is a set of eyelids
The booth is an instrument that God created
To record us trying to find him
But don't let the word throw you off
Religion and spirit are two different plots
Just know that it's bigger than me and my ego
When I'm flyin
Take me higher
I've got something to pray for
Please leave me when I'm guided
Who said that "Life is cinema"?
This is epic, be present
I'm right here
Selfish, selfish, selfish me, yeah, me, yeah
Girlfriend, break-up, new one, one-night stand, cheat, cheat, repeat that
Drug use, clean up, drug use, drug use, clean up, drug use, rehab
Fuck you, I suck dude, self-loathing, self-esteem, ego, then me again
Put a soundtrack right in the middle
A neverending quest to try and get fans
There you have the beginning, a middle and a really shitty end
Nah, give me a break through, can I get a montage, come on I need that
Humble me, give me a conflict, a hardship, let me break through this cement
They're gonna be so disappointed when they roll the credits and
I realize that my movie sucked and I was the only one that could edit it
Well the course, the chain of events, that would be the evidence, some say it's coincidence
I say I found something greater than myself and started accepting it
And I can see, feel, taste and smell again
And I'm the only one with the hammer to break this shell I'm in
It's gonna take me crackin' this mirror to finally be myself again
Met my potential a long time ago and I'm not stopping til I resemble him

(I got soul but I'm not a soldier...)

[Hook: Lil Wayne]

Darkchild, Mary

[Verse 1]
'Cause the sex was good, you had my mind
And I let you come back every time
You would violate and cross the line
And you knew that I would be the type to
Always wait so patiently, thinkin'
You was comin' home to me
Well, damn, I never heard the keys
Or felt your taps sayin', "Are you asleep?"
Rewind that
'Cause the sex was good, you had my mind
And I, I let you come back every time
You would violate and cross the line
And you knew that I would be the type to
Always wait so patiently, thinkin'
You was comin' home to me
Well, damn, I never heard the keys
Or felt your taps sayin', "Are you asleep?"

[Chorus]
Don't wanna play house no more
You're so dumb to think you gon' marry me
I got to be out my mind to think I need someone to carry me
I've done enough cryin', cryin', cryin' (Cryin', cryin', cryin')
It's time to say bye, bye, bye
It's time I do something for me

[Verse 2]
Time I choose my clothes
Choose my friends, be with my family
They been askin' "Girlfriend, where you been?"
We ain't seen you in weeks
Been chasin' this fool around
Thinkin' he gon' hold me down
I would follow his lead
Thinkin' I would be the one he keep around
When I ain't need it, not your finance
And all that I needed, real commitment
I really couldn't see it, not the real man
You said you would be in this relationship
So many men think (These men)
That all a girl needs (They think)
Is to be sold a dream (A dream)
But I won't fall for it

[Chorus]
Don't wanna play house no more
You're so dumb to think you gon' marry me
I got to be out my mind to think I need someone to carry me
I've done enough cryin', cryin', cryin' (Cryin', cryin', cryin')
It's time to say bye, bye, bye
It's time I do something for me

Don't wanna play house no more
You treat me all wrong, tired of you playin' me
I been lookin' at the front door
This ain't yours so let me come in
Don't wanna play house no more
No more, I'm tired of you playin' me
I've done enough cryin', cryin', cryin'
It's time I do something for me

[Verse 3]
You turned your back, and back I came running
But the simple fact is that you ain't want me
Done enough lying and crying to myself
Nothing left to do but move
What else can I do but leave?
I believed that you would marry me, but now I gotta breeze
I be's with LT when you come to your senses
But then it's too late
That's always how it be
Catch me with the B's on the wheels, Giuseppe's on the hills
Shoulda Marc Jacob Fe Fe bagged me when you had me
Next dude will gladly pick up where you left off
Ice me, wife me, you ain't gonna have me

[Chorus]
Cryin', cryin', cryin' (Cryin', cryin', cryin')
It's time to say bye, bye, bye
It's time I do something for me
Don't wanna play house no more
You're so dumb to think you gon' marry me
(To think that you would marry me)
I got to be out my mind to think
I need someone to carry me
I've done enough cryin', cryin', cryin' (Cryin', cryin', cryin')
It's time to say bye, bye, bye
It's time I do something for me
Don't wanna play house no more
You're so dumb to think you gon' marry me
I got to be out my mind to think I need someone to carry me
I've done enough cryin', cryin', cryin' (Cryin', cryin', cryin')
It's time to say bye, bye, bye
It's time I do something for me, for me, for me

[Outro]
It's time I do something for me, for me, for me

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
You were my sun, you were my earth
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no
So you took a chance, and made other plans
But I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
You don't have to say what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
There'll never be
And don't it make you sad about it?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
Girl, I refuse, you must have me confused
With some other guy
The bridges were burned, now it's your turn, to cry
Cry me a river, cry me a river
Cry me a river, cry me a river (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
You know that they say some things are better left unsaid
It wasn't like you only talked to him and you know it
Don't act like you don't know it
And all of these things people told me
Keep messin' with my head (Messin' with my head)
Should've picked honesty
Then you may not have blown it

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
You don't have to say what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
There'll never be
And don't it make you sad about it?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
Girl, I refuse, you must have me confused
With some other guy
The bridges were burned, now it's your turn, to cry
(Go on and just) Cry me a river
(Go on and just) Cry me a river
(Baby, go on and just) Cry me a river (Yeah, yeah)

[Bridge: Timbaland & Justin Timberlake]
Oh! (Oh! Well!) The damage is done

So I guess I'll be l-l-l-l-l-leaving (Oh, oh, oh!)

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
You don't have to say what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
There'll never be
And don't it make you sad about it?

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Cry me a river (Go on and just), cry me a river
(Baby, go on and just)
Cry me a river (You can go on and just), cry me a river (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
They either hate or they on your side
Fuck it, we ridin' (Fuck it, we ridin')
Playin' games just to ease your mind
Damn, I'm high (Damn, I'm high)
And I know (I know) that they (That they) never understand
'Cause I'm just (I'm just) a kid (A kid), but they tell me I'm the man

[Verse 1]
Hey, hey (Hey)
I be goofy, kind of funny, actin' stupid, but they love me
We don’t do it for the money, just some food up in my tummy
Feelin' cool, livin' great, in the mood, tryna sway
Ice cubes in my drink, never doin' what they say
They some losers full of hate, a nuisance gettin' cake
What I'm doin' every day, probably ruin all your games
I got some brand new clothes, fresh, right out the package
The moon lookin' like I could reach right up and grab it
So close to the sky, I'm high
Was a youngin' who would hope to be fly, oh my
God, now I'm everywhere with my squad
When I spit a rhyme, they applaud
And I say, "Thank you, thank you, you're far too kind"
You heard everybody's music, but wait 'til you hear mine

[Chorus]
They either hate or they on your side
Fuck it, we ridin' (Fuck it, we ridin')
Playin' games just to ease your mind
Damn, I'm high (Damn, I'm high)
And I know (I know) that they (That they) never understand
'Cause I'm just (I'm just) a kid (A kid), but they tell me I'm the man

[Verse 2]
Hey (Hey)
If you know me, you are hatin', listen, homie, I've been waitin'
For a golden opportunity to know that I'ma make it
Where I'm goin', I could take it, went from flowin' in the basement
To shows in all stages, on the road to different places
Got they thumbs in the air, smile on they faces
Fans with grey hair and fans rockin' braces
Fans who be buyin' me drinks to get me wasted
Groupie hoes, thirsty as hell and wanna taste it, heh
See, this life even shocks me
I got some people on my nuts, call 'em jockey, haha
And I ain't even gettin' cocky
But if you hatin', I'ma tell you this: Watch me
'Bout to do somethin' amazin', bro
World changin' my brain, got a gang of flows
And this for those who always came to shows
And who were still by my side with no bank to blow, whoa

[Chorus]
They either hate or they on your side
Fuck it, we ridin' (Fuck it, we ridin')
Playin' games just to ease your mind
Damn, I'm high (Damn, I'm high)
And I know (I know) that they (That they) never understand
'Cause I'm just (I'm just) a kid (A kid), but they tell me I'm the man

[Outro]

But I can't be with her
As much as she like me to
She like me too much
Thats the problem
"Oh my god" then
Shorty be whillin
And when I say I got to leave
You wouldn't believe
All of the things
That she'll do
And all of the things
She'll say to make me stay
And I be like "damn"
I've been that boy for forever
I'll be back someday
But she wanna go with me to outer space
So we made love in the Milky Way
& then I send her on her way

Hook: Dre

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
And now she's not pickin' up the phone
I don't know what to do
Thinking about going to her home
Landing my spaceship on her roof
Going through her bedroom window
Only to find a mans shoe on the floor
Ohhh noo, ohhh noo, ohhh noo
And I'm like
"Who am I to blame?"
When she was pleading "Wayne
If you ever leave again
I don't wanna see you anymore."
Hop back in my space ship
Hope that I don't spot you at all
Eh eh oh
Because baby if I see you
I'mma probably knock your ass out
Eh eh oh
Put you in the trunk
Throw him over the bridge, and take off
Hook: Dre

Almost bought one, they told me 60 thou
I took my cash, spend it round town like Taz
Last king, young CEO, my nigga Jazz
Bitch it's rainin, duffle bag
It's opportune, let's make it fast
You goin' let it drip a little
Then I'm a make it splash
Box it in a doggy bag

[Gudda Gudda:]
Bitch I'm on fire
Young Money rida'

Treat your head like a fake purse, get knocked off
The coupe I take the top off
Woof, bitch, top dog
Lay yo girl face on my lap, let her play with my sack
Then the bitch get lock jaw
We on top like toupes
Hat to the back, with 2 braids
Weezy out in 2 days
Young Money (Dooms day)
We about to act up
Money I'm a stack up
Crack my safe burn 100 stacks, and then I crack up
I'm hittin' like a Mack truck
Gun make a bitch nigga back up
Stacks on deck
Hit a nigga on the neck
And the bitch nigga don't get back up
Young Gudda times 2, that the name, ho
Got a pot of gold like the end of the rainbow
You ain't a ballin' nigga what the fuck you came for
Oh you here with yo main ho
I'm leaving with that same ho
Gudda
Startin' to smell like money in this bitch
Guess you know it's Young Money in this bitch

Tyga Tyga Gudda Gudda yea he in this bitch

[Intro]
I'm Well Done
I'm Well Done

[Verse 1]
Fuckin' Ric Flair leglock
Headshot, body cropped, make his fuckin' mama watch
Squeeze your baby inside a fuckin' baby bottle pop
Whisky top, running through your blood til your kidneys pop
Pillow-talk, leave your lips on top of your pillowtop
Pop you while your roof off, on top of a rooftop
Oswald, Mankind, all you niggas getting socked
Lethal wop, Whopper it til your burger leave the lettuce out
Check this out, no one around
Put your faces on my crotch
Li-li-lick, lollipop, frog-tongue on my cock

[Verse 2]
Dead mammals in my living room
Louis minks, foxtails, doper than the metal spoon
Ay fool, split your enchilada, now it's worm food
Moving like worms move, burn ya like perms do
One two, leader of the Rat Pack Tat crew
Hat removed, when I walk in rooms, make her eyes twitch
Juke ya, cut your shit out like a coupon
In due time, reign of a new king
Well done

[Tyga]
It's that young beastie nigga
Brrr-hah stick em
It's still no fitteds, Dupont finish
Courtside tickets,a Laker in my City
Purple like Grimace
Roof pop like titties
Pound sign - sit your ass down, bitch, I'm busy
I'm balling like a bitch - all-blue Ken Griffies
You a chicken, rotisserie, squeeze the ... to your lemon
Everything I do new, nigga, cut the red ribbon
Give me space to the left
Leave your face indented
There's too many women, while these niggas out there staring
T-Raw Mclaren, boy flyer than a parrot
Me and that money got a marriage
I was the first to pop her cherry

[Hook - Tyga]
Now it's big living, fast cars, model women
Penthouse, hella-chains - why you trippin?
Money & Liquor
Money & Liquor

Gold sofas, gold bottles, gold women
Gold grills, gold rings - why you trippin?

Money & Liquor
Money & Liquor
Gudda Gudda nigga

[Verse 2 - Gudda Gudda]
Stay young Gudda nigga
Fuck them other niggas
Stumbling from the liquor
Throwing money at the strippers
Promethazine mixer, Codeine sipper
Ring on my pinky looking like the Big Dipper
Money talks, we speak often
Murking the beat, we gon need a coffin
Got a freak riding shotgun
She rolling hard on the pink dolphin
Young nigga, but the money is old
Big estates, the money don't fold
Jewelry box full of colorful shit, but
Everything on my neck is gold
Get in it, let's finish it
You talk shit, I live this shit
She love a nigga to death, so when I'm
In the pussy, I kill the shit
Money flowing like a river
I buy the bar out, I mix the money with the liquor
Nigga!

[Hook - Tyga]
Now it's big living, fast cars, model women

[Intro]
Well, well done

[Verse 1]
Treat my dick like a dog bitch, fetch
I put it down your throat
Then I bust it on your neck
T-killer I’m a mess, Homer Simpson in the flesh
Yeah I’m doper then syringe
Fuck your bitch and all her friends
Make amends for all my sins I ain’t trippin on a bitch
I’m a bull give me wings
Too many tats on my skin
You know my rank nigga
If you speaking, come proper
Hit you with a shot like boom shaka laka
Knock your ass to your feet like too much vodka
I’m hotter than a two dollar pistol from a Rasta
Yeah they call me Tyga with a heart of Mufasa
Nigga I ain’t lying
Hard to find like a fossil
I’ll be outta here king shit like Cairo
Asian nigga kick you in the face Tae Bo
I’m rising with the heat on these niggas like pyro
I’m just freestyling, a nigga young and wilding
Lord I done suffered through too many years
And we done shed so many tears
Lost many peers no memories
Just misery killing all my enemies
Fuck her til she can’t see
Fuck until we can’t breath
Knock knock who there, deez nuts in your face
Bitch I’m eating: get a plate
All my niggas do the same, most my homies Hoover Gang
Larry Hoover, Lawrence Taylor, giant Glocks
Patch your eye like a Raider
Too many bitches call it pussy mania
Niggas tryna borrow swag, I don’t do favors
Pac shit middle finger
Finger fuck whoever hating
I’m the shit ya’ll niggas constipated
Fuck your bitch it's easy, even to a caveman
I’m good, Meagan
Make it rain til the roof cave in
85 laker, high rise, purple lasers
Marc Jacobs famous like the Mona Lisa
No patients leave her in the lobby waiting
Vacation, nigga I ain’t talking Vegas
All these niggas stealing swag
I've been getting tats since I was fourteen
Tell my bitch throw it in the bag
Twenty-two for the Balmain jeans
I'm smoking these niggas they needing nicotine
Rat race, first place famous like a Kennedy
All my diamonds lemonade, hearts stay below degrees
Too many bitches marry them all, #polygamy
Make a waterfall, Yosemite
Highest underrated nigga
I don't need you rating me
Sold out shows way before this shit was BET
Knocking at my front door
Bitches trying to peek and see
Last Kings, YMCMB you know the team
Just counted fifty thou in my Waldorf suite
Man, this life's too fucking easy
Ferrari red all over, call it Santa bleeding
Pipe dreaming, put the reality key in
All we do is win every day and fucking weekend
Me and my bitch riding around bumping The Weeknd
You don't wanna feature me
I'mma eat your beat then
Spit it back out, it's nasty
She don't wanna swallow kids but she loves gagging
High-fashion ass models and beauty pageants
Young Aladdin, Versace carpet
I need a Jasmine
Tour bus riding
Got a show up in Dallas
T-Tyga Maverick
Louis V print fabric
Man I swear these niggas moving backwards
I'm moving faster
Tell the niggas put original in all my captions

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Try and hand me a joint, Burner
Mm-hmm...
Starsky and Hutch minus the fuzz
Mild flat boys, hmh-hmh-hmh
That's what you wanna call us anyway

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
They're saying it’s 'bout time some real niggas made it
And when I go outside, they're saying I’m famous
And some don’t understand but listen close and you’ll find out
I’m running through them grams, you'll smell the kush when I ride out
I’m moving at top speed, my engine is foreign
I travel across seas where women are gorgeous
And niggas know it’s us, we make it tough to mistake it
Just let me roll one up and when it’s stuffed up, I'ma blaze it
Then we off to the races

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Starsky and Hutch minus the fuzz
Me and Spitta stick together like, huh
Cotton and mud, some chicks counting up buds
Mouth got cotton, prolly from the drugs
Lot of pot in my process, love
Don't hate a nigga cause I'm blessed, judge me by my progress, bruh
I obsess with every dollar I get
Fuck you think we made it out the projects for?
The object is to make money and get the most from it
And more money, cause more money ain't enough of it
I know niggas who had money and let it go to nothing
Just blow money and ain't got nothing to show for it, that’s fucking stupid
Same as my diamonds and the fact I’m buying all this new shit
Made a million a way, a nigga grind’ll be a blueprint
I’m talking champagne shit, Audemar tailor made shit
Look at my jackets, say hand made bitch

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
They're saying it’s 'bout time some real niggas made it
And when I go outside, they're saying I’m famous
And some don’t understand but listen close and you’ll find out
I’m running through them grams, you'll smell the kush when I ride out
I’m moving at top speed, my engine is foreign
I travel across seas where women are gorgeous
And niggas know it’s us, we make it tough to mistake it
Just let me roll one up and when it’s stuffed up, I'ma blaze it
Then we off to the races

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
And I'm a pimp, see
Leaning in my ride like how Bun B
Sitting tall on my chrome seat but I’m low in the seat
My girl in the sheet fast asleep, I’m in the street
After the cheddar, peddling melodies, purchasing better things
On the road to the riches, I done drove over niggas
My nigga we major, we been major since independent
Made it to what they saying, we made it but we ain't hearing it
We too busy getting it, hound dog sniffing it out
Twisting a whole pound, celebrating the fact that
Them wack fools had it but this here’s the take back
And them haters can’t hate that
Salute me from across a crowded club, homie, I take that as love
Real nigga shit the only thing I’m dealing with slim
Bitch you know that I’m the reason that you still in this club
Get out the corner of my eye and get in this truck

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
They're saying it’s 'bout time some real niggas made it
And when I go outside, they're saying I’m famous
And some don’t understand but listen close and you’ll find out

I’m moving at top speed, my engine is foreign
I travel across seas where women are gorgeous
And niggas know it’s us, we make it tough to mistake it
Just let me roll one up and when it’s stuffed up, I'ma blaze it
Then we off to the races

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Yelling, "Suck a dick or die hoe"
See your main bitch is my side hoe
Smoking top shelf on the top floor
I’m a boss bitch, I take my time and get it pronto
You probably fucking around
Doing some shit I ain't got time for (pussy boy)
Fuck you and your whole anatomy bitch
My new crib look like an academy bitch
It’s Finally Famous the faculty bitch
Killin’ these niggas, no casualties
Money and weed is a real nigga salary
Man, these rappers sound like me
And honestly that shit is so flattering bitch
(Thank you, thank you, thank you) They want me to slip up and fall
Crash, burn, but I just keep pissing them off (off)
I got movies to make (make) I got women to call (call)
I got deals on the table, I can’t be dealing with y’all, nigga
Rather crash parties and burn money (money)
And if you pick the ashes up, you still can’t earn from me (from me)
Bottom line is I never wait in line bitch
And I’m rolling King Kush, I’m your Royal Highness

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
They're saying it’s 'bout time some real niggas made it
And when I go outside, they're saying I’m famous

Then we off to the races

[Verse 1]
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all so quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake

[Pre-Chorus]
Whoa, holding my breath
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

[Verse 2]
Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time, I'm wishing he was you instead

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding onto nothing

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

[Bridge]
I know, I know
I just know
You're not gone
You can't be gone, no

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
I can't go back, I'm haunted

[Outro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I'd see it break
Never thought I'd see it

[Verse 1]
Were you the one who said that I would be nothing?
Well, I'm about to prove you wrong
I'm not the only one who believes in something
My one wish is about to come true

I'm not stopping for you
No matter what you do
I'll just keep on dreaming
My head up in the clouds
When nobody is around to see

[Chorus]
This is my moment, my moment
It's my time, flying high-line, mine
Feels like my moment, my moment
I've waited for so long
But now everybody knows this is my moment

It's my time, flying high-line, mine
Feels like my moment, my moment
I've waited for so long
But now everybody knows this is my moment

[Verse 2]
You knew it all along, I was afraid of you
I thought I couldn't be myself
You tried to be my friend
But I wouldn't let you
Remember what you said
Don't miss out on your chance
Your life is in your hands
So take it just as far as you can
But trusting in yourself, forget everyone else
Believe!

[Chorus]
This is my moment, my moment
It's my time, flying high-line, mine
Feels like my moment, my moment
I've waited for so long
But now everybody knows this is my moment

It's my time, flying high-line, mine
Feels like my moment, my moment
I've waited for so long
But now everybody knows this is my moment

[Bridge]
Haters, said I'll see you later
Can't talk to you right now
I'm getting my paper
Said I'm doing big things
Things you never dreamed of
I hope you are happy cause I'm 'bout to blow up

[Chorus]
This is my moment, my moment
It's my time, flying high-line, mine
Feels like my moment, my moment
I've waited for so long
But now everybody knows this is my moment

[Hook:]
Opportunity in my face so I can't sit back and not take advantage of it
Man I can hardly wait got a date with Miss Success
And I can't stand her up no they don't understand us 'cuz
They say we too material (material)
But money make the world go (round and round x3) yeahh
They say we too material (material)
But money make the world go (round and round x3) yeahh

[Verse 1:]
Wait, they dying to get the diamonds off my plate
The more I give the more they tryin' to take
Like I be serving you this evening got the nerve
To wonder how I eat 'cuz while you sleep-in I'mma wake
Aw man what is ya'll saying, money long ya'lls end like an on ramp
Young boss man I be with a lot of goons
That know how to aim but dat chopper stay on auto-tune
I paint a perfect picture for it
So you going need your high definition cord
They say I made it cause there ain't a thing I can't afford
And car service get me to my plane before it begins to board
Aye they think they hell I'm on a highway
Cause I treat everyday like it's a Friday
My situation straight you looking sideways
On my grizzly cause my grind pays

[Hook:]
Opportunity in my face so I can't sit back and not take advantage of it
Man I can hardly wait got a date with miss success

But money make the world go (round and round x3) yeahh
They say we too material (material)
But money make the world go (round and round x3) yeahh

[Verse 2:]
Three cell phones no home number
The shit that I be on will take you out your zone comfort
Quiet when I'm home but mention me when I'm gone
Schedule getting full I had to sync it with my iPhone
And I can't get out of plane mode
Cause every time I turn around
I wake up in a different time zone (different time zone)
Not concerned with all the fame
But want the world to know my name when I'm gone
So just give me the light
Quiet on the set show me where the cameras at (where the cameras at)
I'm telling you I'm ready (telling you I'm ready)
No I'm telling you I'm ready (I'm telling you I'm ready)

[Hook:]
Opportunity in my face so I can't sit back and not take advantage of it

But money make the world go (round and round x3) yeahh
They say we too material (material)
But money make the world go (round and round x3) yeahh

Yea-hea... it's your boy Mr. Ez-Wider
Principal Ez-Wider to you young man
Here to break down a couple of rules to Flight School
Ya'll niggas ready to fly? Well lets go

Lot of ya'll niggas be calling people bitches just for choking on the weed
That means theres some good good in that blunt ya'll, what you smoking on?
Rule #2: Bring enough for your crew
Lot of ya'll niggas just be bringing them little small ass sacks to a whole session talking about I ain't got enough
Get the fuck out of here with that
Thats how you get expelled ya'll
Rule #3: Ain't shit free
Don't ever come to Ez-Wider talking about oh I ain't got no weed but I got some blunts dawg
Thats a quick way to get bounced straight off the plane okay..
Rule #4: Smoke 'till you can't no more
I know sometimes that kush get real good
And you like in a UFC match and you wanna tap out
But hold on player! Hold on! You can do it
And the golden Rule #5 is always stay high
I don't care what kind of green you smoke pimpin'
Sticks and seeds, as long as it's weed you're good with me
And that's Mr. Ez-Wider's five rules to Flight School
Hope you wrote 'em down ya'll
'cuz you'll need them at the end of the year if you plan on graduating
Now we going to get back to some of that Wiz Khalifa

[Chorus]
I am so unstable
I am so unstable
It's the world that I'm livin in
Filled with angels and demons
I am so unstable

I am so unstable
It's the world that I'm livin in
Filled with angels and demons
I am so unstable
I am so unstable
It's the world that I'm livin in
Filled with angels and demons

[Verse 1]
I was born on the pirate ship
Hold your tongue to say that
Super duper nervous all the time
Never chill back
Never caught slippin', even in my kicks made of ice
All day, all day lookin foward to the night
Feel like I'mma die any minute, so I live on tracks beyond these limits
You should stay free when I partyin and wippin
I can hear them coming, the demons like to listen
I trip out sippin, I re-lax stoned
Never feel safe even if I'm at my home
They can still find me, we ridin all the time
Hot damn she is fine, hope she party all the time
I can be your Eddie, my dick is up and ready
The lust takes over, merging all the hours
Before I go sour, I step back and look at
The evils got me tooken, most cats be shooken

[Chorus]
I am so unstable
I am so unstable
It's the world that I'm livin in
Filled with angels and demons
I am so unstable
I am so unstable
It's the world that I'm livin in
Filled with angels and demons
I am so unstable
I am so unstable
It's the world that I'm livin in
Filled with angels and demons
I am so unstable
I am so unstable
It's the world that I'm livin in
Filled with angels and demons

[Open Verse]

[Chorus]
I am so unstable
I am so unstable
It's the world that I'm livin in
Filled with angels and demons
I am so unstable

It's the world that I'm livin in
Filled with angels and demons
I am so unstable
I am so unstable
It's the world that I'm livin in
Filled with angels and demons
I am so unstable
I am so unstable
It's the world that I'm livin in
Filled with angels and demons

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah, play me something aight

Oh-oh-ohh, ohh

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
We in the party burning up that weed smoke
Smell us everywhere that we go
When niggas try to tell us, we like "Hold up, roll up"
And them bitches ain't coming if they can't
We in the party burning up that weed smoke
Smell us everywhere that we go
When niggas try to tell us, we like "Hold up, roll up"
And them bitches ain't coming if they can't

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Keeping it G and sticking to the plan
Of getting rich and burying all my money in the desert sand
Wasn't no stroke of luck, I played my hand
Man I’ve been up here for hours, fingers tired from rolling every gram
And now my cheese ain't just American, cause I get overseas money
Everywhere I go, somebody scream for me
Looking out the window, my hotel room in Vegas
Thinking, "How the fuck could you hate this?"
Half of these people ain't real niggas shapeshift
Thats why I’m smoking O.G. til I’m weightless, yeah
And my homies are Taylor Gang
We rolling up papers and yeah of course they gon hate
But fuck what they say cause we gon stay the same
Higher than hell, flyer than Delta
Niggas try and fail, think it's time you fired everyone hired to help ya
Getting all this bread, wanna know why, I could tell ya
Other than that, yeah

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
We in the party burning up that weed smoke
Smell us everywhere that we go
When niggas try to tell us, we like "Hold up, roll up"
And them bitches ain't coming if they can't
We in the party burning up that weed smoke
Smell us everywhere that we go
When niggas try to tell us, we like "Hold up, roll up"
And them bitches ain't coming if they can't

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Yeah, O.G. got first seasons of BAPE, BBC
Make cake from CDs, mixtape shit for free
Either way I go 100% all game
48 minutes, no bench sitting at all, mane
Y’all may have thought stoners would fall off schedule
But we ahead of you due to these medical power laws
Preserve jars open, herb in the bars I'm quoting
And the times I ain't, on hemp pages, I wrote it
For your speakers to smoke it
Now pan on them lenses and focus on the dopest
In the Mitchell and Ness Marino, see how far back I’ve been quoted
And they hoe suckas know that from Spitta they styles stolen
I ain't mad though, I’m glad though
Thought I’d feel a little bit different being a dad yo, yeah bro
Wiz smoked out the BET Awards, I wrapped up my Jet Life tour
That's why them bitches roll that weed for us, nigga

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
We in the party burning up that weed smoke
Smell us everywhere that we go

And them bitches ain't coming if they can't
We in the party burning up that weed smoke
Smell us everywhere that we go
When niggas try to tell us, we like "Hold up, roll up"
And them bitches ain't coming if they can't

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
They wanna roll like me
Cause I’m living life like it's no police or I’m overseas
I’m watching no smoking signs just rolling weed
Cause it’s the motherfucking life when you roll with G’s (boi)
Dissing these bitches, you entertained
You tell her you love her too, I tell her she’s out her brain
I’m on the road to the millies, I started on Penny Lane
Now the bandwagon is packed, you might could hop on the train
At the top, so now her top all off
I never pay hoes, I only pay cops off
And tell these niggas they gotta take that disguise off
I’m from Detroit, we eat you little hoes alive with hot sauce
Fucking bitch, I might come a little tardy though
Fatty rolled, Chris Farley smoke
You niggas rolling up Barley bro, I’m all-green as the safari’s go
You bitches already know

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
We in the party burning up that weed smoke
Smell us everywhere that we go
When niggas try to tell us, we like "Hold up, roll up"
And them bitches ain't coming if they can't
We in the party burning up that weed smoke
Smell us everywhere that we go
When niggas try to tell us, we like "Hold up, roll up"
And them bitches ain't coming if they can't

[Verse 1 - Gucci Mane]
I'm a G, from on top of sheets
Gucci Mane a beast
Don't be scared, I just come prepared
When you fuckin me
Half a mil laying on the floor
Why you're life a bore?
I'm a whore in the Gucci store
?
Make them more, baby I'm on tour
Make her open doors, do a chore
As I smoke some more
Make her love me more
I'm a star, twisting up cigars
Pistols in my car
Smack your head, like a ? lead
Wanna go to war?
One shot, she's so petrified
When I'm passing by
With my eye let her know I like
Baby, you my type
Shorty scared, she don't wanna sex
You know how I play
She afraid, she so scared of death
No need to be scared!
Baby legs behind your head!
She scared of that..
Hanging off the bed!
She scared of that..
Beat you til you're dead
She sacred of that..
Running from the *uh*, shorty scared
Scary cat

Any time we fight
She scared of that
What I'm gonna try tonight
You know you scared of that
In the club with all my ice
He scared of that
He too sacred to live his life
He's a scary cat

Anything you niggas wanna do
I did it! Any amount of money you
Can think of, I spent it
Any car out in the streets I've driven
Any bad bitch you could think of
I hit it. Shawty wanna give me that ass tonight
But a nigga hating and he won't let it go
What he don't know is I dunn been there before
?
Hit it ho, baby hit his ho

[Verse 1]
You're everything I thought you never were
And nothing like I thought you could've been
But still, you live inside of me
So tell me how is that?
You're the only one I wish I could forget
The only one I'd love to not forgive
And though you break my heart, you're the only one
And though there are times when I hate you
'Cause I can't erase
The times that you hurt me
And put tears on my face
And even now while I hate you
It pains me to say
I know I'll be there at the end of the day

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, babe
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you
But let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart
And I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl
I'm no broken-hearted girl

[Verse 2]
Something that I feel I need to say
But up to now, I've always been afraid
That you would never come around
And still I wanna put this out
You say you've got the most respect for me
But sometimes I feel you're not deserving me
And still you're in my heart
But you're the only one
And yes, there are times when I hate you
But I don't complain
'Cause I've been afraid that you would walk away
Oh, but now I don't hate you
I'm happy to say
That I will be there at the end of the day

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, babe
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you
But let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart
And I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl

[Bridge]
Now I'm at a place I thought I'd never be, ooh
I'm living in a world that's all about you and me, yeah
Ain't gotta be afraid, my broken heart is free
To spread my wings and fly away
Away with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ohh, ohh, ohh

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be without my baby
I don't want a broken heart
Don't want to take a breath without my baby
I don't wanna play that part
I know that I love you
But let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no
I don't want a broken heart
I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl
Broken-hearted girl no, no
No broken-hearted girl
No broken-hearted girl

[Verse 1]
How long before I get in?
Before it starts, before I begin?
How long before you decide?
Before I know what it feels like?
Where to, where do I go?
If you never try, then you'll never know
How long do I have to climb
Up on the side of this mountain of mine?

[Verse 2]
Look up, I look up at night
Planets are moving at the speed of light
Climb up, up in the trees
Every chance that you get
Is a chance you seize
How long am I gonna stand
With my head stuck under the sand?
I'll start before I can stop
Before I see things the right way up

[Pre-Chorus]
All that noise, and all that sound
All those places I got found

[Chorus]
And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it, then you'd understand

[Verse 3]
Ideas that you'll never find
All the inventors could never design
The buildings that you put up
Japan and China all lit up
The sign that I couldn't read
Or a light that I couldn't see
Some things you have to believe
But others are puzzles, puzzling me

[Pre-Chorus]
All that noise, and all that sound
All those places I got found

[Chorus]
And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it, then you'd understand
Ah when you see it, then you'll understand

[Bridge]
All those signs, I knew what they meant
Some things you can invent
Some get made, and some get sent

[Chorus]
Birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you'd understand

[Hook]
Oh, when you see it, then you'll understand

[Intro]

Walking through the hood, everybody notice me

[Intro]
Ladies and gentleman
My name's Wiz Khalifa and I'm so damn good

[Verse 1]
I earn niggas respect before the cash came
You try me get a ticket I'm in the fast lane
I keep the bigger picture in the glass frame
Plus my city on my back like it's a motherfuckin last name
Where you goin when the driver know your last name
And first class ain't much different from the last plane
Say we the same but I'm nothin like you guys
Nigga, I'm a frequent flyer Taylor Gang or Drink n Drive
Die...
Now everybody's mourning I think we
Runnin' outta liqour bring some more in
Used to say I'm fresh
But now I'm gettin spoiled
Cause new shit gettin' old
These hotels kind of boring
Don't mean to sound unappreciative
But it's obvious the game ain't what you think it is
Yellow diamons speak spanglish on my neck and wrist
Don't even check the list
They expecting us

[Hook]
See I'm packed ready to go go go
We in the air you oh So LOW!
Shawty we gon live it up
And girl I got a lot of but it's just I can't get enough
So I'm a check my bags everything secure with my tags hand me my boarding pass
Yeah... Yeah
And I'll hit you when my flight land

[Verse 2]
Yeah, got me feeling so professional
3 hour trip with only 15 minutes left to go
A small comparison should let you know
Cause only time ya'll niggas got leg room
Is in the exit row
Damn. People tell me I change
That's exactly what I'm getting so I'll never be the same
Niggas losin' weight cause what I spit is lipo
Try to explain but they get it twisted like a micro
I hit the club it's like a light show
Bet this liqour turns the wouldn't into a might go
Got a bitch that's for insurance like she Geico
Try to use her phone to get a picture but the lights... Low
But the bottles still full
And you don't really want this night to end do you?
So sip slow-ow-ow and I'm a put this thing on cruise control

[Hook]
See I'm packed ready to go go go
We in the air you oh So LOW!

And girl I got a lot of but it's just I can't get enough
So I'm a check my bags everything secure with my tags hand me my boarding pass
Yeah... Yeah
And I'll hit you when my flight land

[Verse 1]
Take off my shirt
Loosen the buttons and undo my skirt
Stare at myself in the mirror
Pick me apart piece by piece
Sorrow decreased, pressure released
I put in work, did more than called upon
More than deserved
When it was over, did I wind up hurt? (Yes)
But it taught me
Before a decision, ask this question first

[Chorus]
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing

[Verse 2]
Take off my cool (Take off my cool)
Show them that under here, I'm just like you
Do the mistakes I've made make me a fool?
Or a human with flaws?
Admit that I'm lost, round of applause (Round of applause)
Take the abuse
Sometimes, it feels like they want me to lose (Want me to lose)
It's entertainment; is that an excuse? (No)
But the question that lingers whether win or lose, is

[Chorus]
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing

[Spoken]
Dear Diary, it's Robyn
Entertaining is something I do for a living
This is not who I am
I'd like to think that I'm pretty normal
I laugh (Haha), I get mad, I hurt
I think guys suck sometimes
But when you're in the spotlight, everything seems good
Ooh, yeah
Sometimes I feel like I have it worst
'Cause I have to always keep my guard up
I don't know who to trust
I don't know who wants to date me for who I am
Or who wants to be my friend for who I really am

[Chorus]
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Is this the top? The top of the world?
Top floor, there's weed in the ashtray
It's top-shelf, cap!

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Riding in my Challenger, faded off this weed brownie
Turning down the music cause the weed is loud enough already
Niggas ask me 'bout my pay, I say I keep it steady
Gripping on the wheel, spending money like a politician
Tipping on a bill, it's going down
Like this bitch was sitting on the hill
I keep my girlfriend in them expensive sort of heels and furs and shit
Eat champagne and lobster cause I fucking deserve this shit
Cap! Niggas say I've got an old soul
Well, I tell them that I'm here muh'fucka
And I made it cause my flow cold
I'ma roll some of this weed
I'ma pass it to you and we gon' be so gone
Homie, I got papers and vaporizers
Flavors to stablize ya
Thoroughly-baked cake, can't say a thing with my eyes shut

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
They say they do (they do, they do, they do)
But they don't know (don't know, don't know, don't know)
Who we are (who we are, who we are, who we are)
Superstars

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Uhh, I'm out of here, stratosphere
Paper hella-straight, nappy hair
Bitches seem not to care that you was even there
When we pulled up lit like Times Square
When we pulled up lit like road flares
When we pulled off, them hoes disappeared
Because they know what we be doing over here
She just wanna be high in her underwear
With her iPhone plugged in the wall, power low
Stepping out the shower, threw her a shirt to towel off with
One of the two qualities I want in a bitch
Cause baby girl fuckin with me is some major shit
Fair warning: I gotta wake up to a BJ every morning
And a J while I'm yawning, darling
I got papers and vaporizers, flavors to stablize ya
I'm a fully baked potato, spending my cheddar and chives

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
They say they do (they do, they do, they do)
But they don't know (don't know, don't know, don't know)
Who we are (who we are, who we are, who we are)
Superstars

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
I'm dedicated, hella-faded, high as hell, I'm levitating
I'm rolling up, fuck a wheelchair, ironically, my shit's medicated
Your eyes closed cause you asleep, my eyes closed cause I'm meditating
I gotta go make reservations, at a real nigga's destination
Two girls in the tub, that's luxury
You disagree? That's fuckery, saying, "Fuck you" cause you can't fuck with me
I need my dick sucked, but I'm sucka-free, you are who it sucks to be
I'm accompanied by Finally Famous Over Everything, that's my company
You already know, nigga
Collect the money like it's old, nigga
And I'ma blow it like it's rolled, nigga
And I be stuntin 'til I'm old, nigga
Weed, money and hoes - what a hell of a night!
Fuck you mean? This is everyday life
She in the mirror making sure that she wearing it right
It's apparent she present where I'm appearing tonight

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
They say they do (they do, they do, they do)
But they don't know (don't know, don't know, don't know)
Who we are (who we are, who we are, who we are)
Superstars
When I was young I knew everything
And she a punk who rarely ever took advice
Now I'm guilt stricken, sobbing with my head on the floor
Stop a baby's breath and a shoe full of rice, now

Can't be held responsible
She was touching her face
I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place

For the life of me
I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
For the life of me
I cannot belive we'd ever die for these sins
We were mearly freshman

My best friend took a weeks vacation to forget her
His girl took a weeks worth of valium and slept
Now hes guilt stricken, sobbing with his head on the floor
Thinks about her now and how he never really wept he says
Can't be held responsible
She was touching her face
I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place

For the life of me
I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
For the life of me
I cannot believe we'd ever die for these sins
We were merely freshman

Hey yea yea yea yea yea
Yeah
Hey yea yea yea yea yea

We've tried to wash our hands of all of this
We never talk of our lackin' relationships
And how were guilt stricken sobbing with our heads on the floor
We fell through the ice when we tried not to slip, we'd say

Can't be held responsible
She was touching her face
I won't be held responsible
She fell in love in the first place
For the life of me
I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
For the life of me
I cannot belive we'd ever die for these sins
We were mearly freshman

For the life of me
I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
For the life of me
I cannot believe we'd ever die for these sins
We were merely freshman

For the life of me
I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
For the life of me
I cannot believe we'd ever die for these sins
We were only freshman

For the life of me
I cannot remember
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise
Yeah yeah yeah

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar, Jay Rock, DJ talking]
(Work out for me, work out for me)
(Work out for me, work out for me)

[Verse One: Kendrick Lamar]
Feeling like a mother fucking animal
Hannibal Lecter of 2012
Elected to execute every rapper that has excelled
If music is your calling
You're falling, pick up yourself
If a nigga said he could see me
Bet he told you in Braille, fucker
Put you in front of the street then buy you some bread
Nigga you lunch meat, should've worked at Subway instead
Goliath couldn't bare my triumph
I'm a leader, walk behind me as I walk through Zion
Swinging swords like I'm sparring with a Spartan
Watch they face drop when the beat drop
I drop a real jewel like a Martin, fool
Me and curtains ballin' like peewee kirkland callin' 'em kirk franklin
Stomp 'em, leave 'em hurting
No judgement for a plaintiff
They tried to find me guilty for spitting filthy as O.D.B
But I've been O.D. since '03
That's March 14th, my first recordings
I kicked it like sweet chin
Music on Chuck Norris

[DJ Talking]

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Look, look, look
I'm J-A-Y, Rock to be exact
Niggas said gardens, Watts on the map
Hm, story of this eastside nigga
All my life in the ghetto on the peace side nigga
Where across the tracks, opposites attract
Niggas go hard for the color of they flag
Dope man money, welfare recipients
Unfit mothers never heard of obedience
Ho's so devious, niggas all talk
Right around the corner, deja vu
Same old shit, something like re-runs
Gotta stay sharp, if you slip then you bleed ?
Guns in the Levis, 501s
Niggas don't box, they buy more guns
Uh, that's how it is on these L.A. streets
Don't sleep, don't sleep
Look, catch me sitting in my truck
Remy in this cup
No tags on this bitch, but I don't give a fuck
I ride until the wheels fall off
That's some real shit
Never let them get in your mind, never reveal shit
Let a nigga know your feelings, business and all
He's the type of nigga riffing and wishing on you to fall
Fake niggas try and impersonate your character
That's why I got my mother's fucking eyes on them scavengers
Watch 'em!
My daddy told me that every day
Pray for late Charles, why he have to pass away?
Thinking about my pops, then the stress starts to kick in
Roll me up a fat ass blunt and start drinking
Damn!
Then reality starts to set in
I'm married to the streets and I ain't never had a wedding
I stop selling dope because niggas started telling
Sex, money, and weed: the life we start living
Guns in the closet for niggas who start tripping
Stay in the house when them choppers come out spitting
Stay on your job
Keep your eyes open on every corner
The blink of an eye, and you're a goner
No wronger, tell 'em about the pains of this hunger
Shock 'em like thunder
And the ? going bonkers
Just living my life up on some cool shit
So, nigga just miss me with all that bull shit

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar, Jay Rock, DJ talking]

[Intro]
Why thank you, Jerome, that was a very good speech
Next up we have our last candidate for the 2010 Allderdice High School presidential campaign
We have Mac Miller!

[Verse]
Haha, look
Comin' with the flows of a veteran, Mac for class president
All black Letterman, recognize a gentleman
Know anything but formal, take you out the normal
It's time travel here, step into my portal
Never seem to be another ordinary college fellow
Still keep a bunch of action figures, Donatello's
I used to wet my pants, leave the carpet yellow
Now I'm playin' games with hoes, turn they heart to jello
L's rolled from my wrist to my elbow
Hella smoke got my eyes red like Elmo
Music that I make got me buzzin' like a cellphone
Stickin' to my word, I'm Velcro, hell no
I ain't gon' stop one minute
Better than I ever been, before was just a scrimmage
Now the boy playin' for the cup, this the championship
See the wordplay dance from his lips
All my ladies put ya hands on ya hips, here some candy to lick
Come and holla if ya man is a bitch, haha
Every party that I roll to they demand me to spit
Treat me like I'm Peyton Manning in this
Playa, I don't got no time for the slow grind here in '09
Blow minds with these dope rhymes, call 'em coke lines
Snort it, get distorted, I'm takin' you out of orbit
Plus we poppin' champagne, see the cork twist
Purple piff got me higher than a forklift
Hungry, feedin' like my mother got four tits
I'm livin' in this music, you a tourist
Rocky and Bulwinkle, you just Boris
Boy spit still way sharper than a swordfish
Your whole style just dead like a morgue is
I'm a senior but I stay fresh, man
Class president, never woulda guessed, man
Bitches on me that I ain't never met, man
The only thing that's on ya dick is ya left hand
Wolverine nails signin' on the X, man
They don't hear me up in Def Jam

[Outro]
Oh, thank you, thank you Mac Miller, thank you
Hahaha, oh wow, oh, quite impressive
Quite impressive, Mac Miller

[Intro: Gucci Mane]

Dilly dilly d, look at all these hoochies
I be on the beach in Emilio Pucci
I'm the best, I'm the best, ask Khaled
Sorry little daddy, that card's not valid
I need unlimited black cards like I'm racist
Some real big faces, Louis Vuitton cases
Hoes in the hood say "Nicki Minaj bougie"
I do it B.I.G. so I keep a couple CooGies, hoes

[Chorus: Bobby V]
She got a Fendi fetish, she got a shopping problem
That girl's a shopaholic, she only mess with ballers
She got a Gucci fetish, she got a Louis problem

She got a shopping problem, that girl's a shopaholic

[Verse 3: Bobby V]
Louis V, fuck with me, every day's a shopping spree
Got ice that be clear like glass, I be freakin' blindin' me
My level's hard to see, best to just admire me
Everywhere I go, she go
I go to the sto' just to blow big dough
She got a Louis problem, Louis this and Louis that
Louis hanging from her arm, in her purse, a Louis strap
Big cash is everywhere, haters love to stop and stare
Fly from the shoes to hair, so fucking hate, I don't care
She all about the money, she all about the cash
She all about me, Bobby, 'cause I be serving that ass
I be serving the hard, she be serving me back
I just give her the card, ain't no limit on that

[Chorus: Bobby V]
She got a Fendi fetish, she got a shopping problem

[Verse 4: F1JO]
Silly me, buying all this Louis V
True Religions, rocking Republic, 7's and Frankie B
Gucci, Louis, Fendi, Prada, Escada, Dolce and Gabbana
Long as I'mma keep buying designer she's a rider
Scooped her out of that Nissan, threw her in a Hummer truck
Four wheel drive when you ride, you ain't never stuck
Who is he? Could it be? Young Joey, he gotta be
Honestly the hottest 'cause when you shop there ain't no stoppin' me
I ain't seen no black cards, all I know is push 'em in
Prada gotta block, 100ft cops tryna scuff my Timbalands
Goddamn, I love them haters, stepping on my Maury kids
Me muggin' a Gucci truck, sorta like a 

[?]

[Chorus: Bobby V]
She got a Fendi fetish, she got a shopping problem
That girl's a shopaholic, she only mess with ballers
She got a Gucci fetish, she got a Louis problem
She got a shopping problem, that girl's a shopaholic
She got a Fendi fetish, she got a shopping problem
That girl's a shopaholic, she only mess with ballers
She got a Gucci fetish, she got a Louis problem
She got a shopping problem, that girl's a shopaholic

Pay attention

[Intro]
Soulja, Soulja, Soulja, Soulja, Soulja
I'm the best, bitch, tell 'em to fuck it up

[Verse]
Listen up pay attention it's a genius spittin'
Diss me last week, next week missin' fuck your opinion
I forgot to mention, I'm the best rapper if you don't like me diss me
Similar to Jbar I'm in a daze
S.O.D. got game like a fucking arcade
Shoot at you duck niggas like a fuckin' gun range
Hottest in the rap game; title I obtain
Sumo money, I got heavy paper
Press me it's going down like a elevator
I'm not political correct, I'm not a legislator
Cross tattoo below my eye rest in peace to all my haters
Nigga I don't play boy, I'm not Hugh Hefner
Bunnies in my mansion, and it ain't even Ester.(laughs)
Drop it drop it low girl
Futurism Chris Brown, I can transform her
I'm a fucking genius, Jimmy Neutron
Rich nigga shit, Grey Poupon
Beats, blazin' them, fans, amazing them
Water diamonds on my neck come and take a swim
Guard your life with them, cause you might drown
No lifeguard guaranteed you going down
Speaking to existence, nigga I'm the best
Open my Louis cases looking like a treasure chest
You don't want beef so stay outta harms way
Blow your legs off have you looking like a mermaid
Runnin' at the mouth shut you up like a suitcase
Eat any rapper I'll have his ass soufleed
All year 365, February to February
The only place where success comes before work is inside the dictionary
Niggas sayin' I'm gassed up, fuck you mean? Fuck gasoline
Any rapper on any beat, I'll chop your head, nigga, guillotine
Fake rappers dissin' me like I would forget
Niggas say they gettin money but it's counterfeit
My name gigantic, I sink 'em, titanic
S.O.D. gang all my haters now panic
They thinking, "Goddammit, Soulja Boy's flow is Cajun"
I'm drawing on this beat do you get the illustration?
Everybody hate it
I'm balling so hard I should be on the cover of Sports Illustrated
Yeah I navigate it, then escalade it
Twitter king 2 million in your faces
I'm saying my graces, I'm bout to eat all of ya
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em, I'm a one man orchestra
Instructional videos on you tube
So I can teach you how to do what I do
Haters wanna knock me, but I'm not a damn door
I got a million dollars cash laid across this damn floor
Word around town they got money on my head
Bitch I pull that fuckin chopper and they scramble like eggs
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em that this shit is historical
All the newspapers put this in your editorial
Teach you niggas, swag tutorial
Got a lot of haters, fuck it I want more of ya
RIP all rappers, shout out to young memorial
Don't ask me if I wanna fuck this, cause that question is rhetorical
GOT DAMN!

[Verse 1]
I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearin' the consequence
Drinkin' every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, I'm floatin' in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt 'cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it (Ayy), please don't do it (Ayy)
'Cause one of us goes in and we all go through it (Ayy)
And Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gon' pay it
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know

[Chorus]
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
I be yellin' out, "Money over everything," money on my mind
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize, happened over time
She says, "They miss the old Drake," girl, don't tempt me
"If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do"
I'm like, "Why I gotta be all that?"
But still, I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listening to you expressin' all them feelings
Soap-opera rappers, all these niggas sound like all my children
And that's who you thinkin' is 'bout to come and make a killin'?
I guess it really is just me, myself, and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
'Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it, I ain't even gotta say it, they know

[Chorus]
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
Yeah, they know, yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave 'em a chance to decide
Now it's something they know
They know, they know, they know

[Outro]
I be yellin' out, "Money over everything," money on my mind
Mind, mind-mind
Tell 'em I apologize, it happened over time
Time, time-time
They know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know (Yeah)

[Outro Poem]

[Intro : Gucci Mane]
Dirty Birds in this motherfucker, it's Gucc'! (ay yeah boyyy)
Matter of fact it's Big Gucci in this motherfucker (ay yeah)
Flockaveli, Birdman (ay yeah boyyy)
Ca$h Money, Brick Squad linked up 1017 (BRICK SQUAD !)

[Hook : Waka Flocka]
Hit the streets, make some moves, get my paper, this is what I do !
Blow kush smoke on my haters, this is what I do !
Fuck with the real, fuck you fakers, this is what I do !
About my money ? Fuck you pay me, this is what I do, huh ?

This is what I do, bitch ! This is what I do, huh ?
This is what I do, for real ? This is what I do, word ?
This is what I do, bitch ! This is what I do

[Verse 1 : Gucci Mane]
It's Big Gucci, (Ha !) mob moves you wise fools
You can't mute me, my whole life I'm ProTools
First day appeal, just salute me or shoot me
I stand on my word, I'm like Luke in the 90's
Cocaine crazy, 1980 baby
2/12 they birthed me, now find me in Miami
East Atlanta with me, always to the Grammy's
This time ? Big bucks, no Whammies
My trunk slammin', my track jammin'
I'm too fancy, manners I left 'em
I'm healthy, stealthy, and wealthy, you try me ?
I'll probably show a nigga how to drive a jet ski
Them Brick Squad niggas got me like I got me
Me, Flock and Baby back to Bank in red Bugattis
Brick Squad, Zone 6, Ca$h Money, whattup ?
I might just fuckin' buy my mom a Maserati

[Hook]

[Verse 2 : Waka Flocka Flame]
I got 6's on my red & black whip (This is how I do)
Watch them girls choose, iced up like a fool
Po'n lean in my styrogoam, this is how I Screw
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh... ha! (Flocka !)
Flexin' with the crew, mean muggin' who ?
Bad attitude, what-chu, wanna, do ?
20 bottles, 40 blunts, meet me, on the, moon (Hold up)
Make it, make it, rain, now my lil' bitch strippers call me Papa Mane
Let my, pants hang, watch me, do my, chain, swang
Takin', bitches, mane, with this, yellow, diamond, karat, chain
Waka, Flocka, Flame, Gucci, Gucci, Mane
He with the Birdman, this is how we hang

[Hook]

[Verse 3 : Juiceman]
Ay ! Ayy ! Ayyy !
This is what I do, when I cut a damn fool
Man I come through Chevrolet, but it look grapefruit
Get my money stack it up, this is what real players do (Yessir)
If, he don't get no money then that nigga need to shoot
Smokin' kush at the house, while yo' bitch clean my shoe
Real gangsta nigga mayyyne, this is what I do
Say lil' partner just hit me sayin' "Man I need a deuce" (Okay !)
So I hit him with the Four's, this is what I do
Killed yo' baby momma, this is what I do (Damn !)
Work chipped cell phones, this is what I do
Rims on my car look like man they runnin' out they shoe
With that blue 20 piece, look like my backyard swimming pool
Well, I'm the girl for every high school guy, yeah, I got everything
A little shirt and a skirt so high, every month you can spot a cotton tampon string
I'll drop my books, then I'll bend and then I'll bend a little more
Everyone thinks Ashley's my best friend, well that bitch is a whore

With a capital H-O-A-R
Ignorance is bliss
Who needs feminism with an ass like this?
And a capital H-O-A-R you guys liking what you see?
Cause if beauty's on the inside, you might as well go inside me

Well, I'm the guy for that high school girl, yeah partying is my life
In a few hours I'll be hitting the gym
And in a few years I'll be hitting my wife
You know, I like to hang loose
"No way! So does my crotch!
Well I hope you brought your man juice cause I bought scotch

With a Capital One no hassle card, stolen from my dad
Dignity's overrated, self-respect's a fad
Well, I'm like a game of baseball cause there's something you might catch."
Well, and if you put out I'd say that we're a perfect
"I'd say that we're a perfect
I'd guess that we're a perfect match."
A perfect match
A perfect match

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah nigga
This them weed raps y'all was talking about
Aye, turn my headphones up
I'm talking straight shit
I got money now motherfucker
I had money then but this real money bitch
Hahahah, ohh

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
King size papers, king size bed
Niggas blow money but I'd rather keep mine instead
Roll something nigga, blow something
Say you're ballin out of control, let a nigga hold something
Especially if you got it and he don't put his niggas on
Tell me what's the sense of even having it fo'
Cause when you're broke, you'll have everything to gain
When you lose it all, let you inhale out the vape
Do it for the taste
Usually I roll one up to pass around but now I'm smokin' to the face
Cause chiefing with niggas is such a waste
Unless they my niggas
And nine times out of ten, they got their own pound with them
Own pack of papers and filters, something to grind
We be smoking them things like six at a time, five in the air
Four breakin' down, three in my head, two on my mind, nigga

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
One rolled, one rolled, one rolled
I keep more than one rolled, one rolled, one rolled
One rolled, one rolled, one rolled
I keep more than one rolled, one rolled, one rolled
I keep more than

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
A bit of a pothead, it has been said
I keep one rolled up like LL's pantlegs
Full of life in this bitch, though I may seem half-dead
Trust me, I'm cool, I just ain't talking to you
And them checks coming through as just as I predicted
Got a bigger portion cause the Jets eating off bigger dishes now
Ain't I the biggest fish up in this pond?
Since life's a bitch, tell her roll my shit up huh
Secret compartment in my car, James Bond
Though I'm James Bong, nigga bread long
And my name known in e'ry home household
Caught them pussies slippin' tryna squeeze in the mouse hole
That cheese is not yours, you are not chose by the gods
To live as we do so play your role in the movie, ain't no pause
No rewind for no man, wait time, so I ain't wasting mine
More grass, more green, more grind
Nigga I keep

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
One rolled, one rolled, one rolled
I keep more than one rolled, one rolled, one rolled
One rolled, one rolled, one rolled
I keep more than one rolled, one rolled, one rolled
I keep more than

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
And these bitch ass niggas
Fuck around, might have to bitch-smack me a nigga
Roll around with a bunch of get-rich ass niggas
Who the man? You ain't even gotta ask these niggas
I'mma fuck around and take these niggas' last three pictures
Man these bitches breaking they neck just to pass weed with us
We roll, get high, get drunk, more shots, reload
Too high, he knows, three more, C4, we blow
Bitch, how could you be so fine?
Shake that ass, she so mine
Taking more double shots than free throw lines
I might hit like three, four times
They say "What the fuck is you on?" Fuck if I'm right
Fuck it, I'm on, you fucking at home
Watching my ass, mad that I'm on
On my way to the top, and I'm coming along with one rolled

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
One rolled, one rolled, one rolled
I keep more than one rolled, one rolled, one rolled
One rolled, one rolled, one rolled
I keep more than one rolled, one rolled, one rolled
I keep more than

[Intro: Kanye West]
Uh-oh, damn, uh-oh
1985 white Lamborghini Countach, two of 'em

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I need a slow motion video right now
'Cause I'm movin' in slow motion, slow motion
Feelin' like Hype Williams shootin' a nigga
Shootin' a nigga, hey, hey, hey
I need a slow motion video right now, ayy, ayy

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Damn, baby, pussy can't be your only hustle
Unless you bad as Naomi Russell
I mean a lot of niggas got money
So basically, Russell ain't the only Russell
Russell Brand, Russell Crowe
Zero, zero, zero, zero, a whole lot of Os
What you after, actor money?
You in line behind currency, yeah, you after money
Bulletproof condom when I'm in these hoes
Got staples on my dick, why? Fuckin' centerfolds
And I swear to God they so cold
Got a nigga in Miami wearing winter clothes
I got my fur on, feelin' like Jerome
She got her fur too, we get our his and her on
Don't look at the jewelry, or get your blur on
Too close, you comatose, so dope, you overdose
Get back, you overclose, oh no
Whole hood loved son and then I blessed 'em with that Polo
Niggas was making music and then my first solo
Collo Drolo, sponsored by Manolo
She got Zeppi Notos ready for some photos
Yeah, and I'm cold, bitch, please try to keep the door closed
Lanvin thousand-dollar tee with no logos
Let me show you what I see when my eyes closed

[Chorus: Jay Z & Kanye West]
Take it how you want 'til a nigga dead
'Til then, I'm the illest motherfucker alive
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh
Whole world aiming at a nigga head
Because I'm the illest motherfucker alive
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh, hol' up

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
King Hov, I'm exactly what the fuck you think
Eleven in a row, Bill Russell rings
Michael Jordan swag, y'all think Michael Jordan bad
Nigga, I got five more rings than Michael Jordan had
Elvis has left the building, now I'm on the Beatles ass
Niggas hear Watch the Throne, yeah, it's like the Beatles back
Bey-Bey my Yoko Ono, Rih-Rih complete the family
Imagine how that's gon' look front row at the Grammys
Fuck your awards like Eddie Murphy's couch
The Roc is in the building, we should have stayed in the house
I don't even know what we doing here
Seems to me a complete waste of gear
Just a fuckin' waste of time, a complete waste of bottles
Niggas' fashion is weak, they be wastin' all the models
Got the oversized Rollie, let me show thee how to do it
When I say it then you see it, it ain't only in the music
Basquiats, Warhols, serving as my muses
My house like a museum so I see 'em when I'm peeing
Usually you have this much taste, you European
That's the end of that way of thinking, nigga, never again
Know when to leave when the heat is coming, I learnt that
This is where DeNiro would be if he ain't turn back
Fuck Sosa, this Hova, this is real life
This is what the ending of Scarface should feel like

[Outro: Kanye West & Kid Cudi]
I need a slow motion video right now
'Cause I'm movin' in slow motion, slow motion (I'm moving in slow motion, slow motion)
Feelin' like Hype Williams shootin' a nigga (I'm moving in slow motion, slow motion)
Shootin' a nigga, hey, hey, hey (I'm moving in slow motion, slow motion)
I need a slow motion video right now (I'm moving in slow motion, slow motion)
Ayy, ayy (I'm moving in slow motion, slow motion)

[Kendrick Lamar]
I'm on Union Square
Kendrick Lamar, violin, we take it there
Me and my man, no one compare
That's like two left shoes, you fools
I'm so rude, my flow is so crude
Spit at the mouth, foam and drool
I'm on top of the world, I'm on my pedestal
Looking under your girl's dress - now that's a mess
Lift my flows like I flip your wife
And pass it to Sounwave down the way
You know he's nice
ADHD, producer, recruit ya
To the armies ?
Take a nigga to war
You know how I'm about to settle the score
Kendrick, Ramal spelled backwards
Come and get me, you're nothing but target practice
You're actors, coming at you with my flows
Like acrobatics. You never can stride into Compton
You get stomped on, what is you're talking about?
You don't want none..

Good weed and cold drinks
Taylor, Taylor, Taylor
Thanks for putting this together Jerm!
And we gon be here forever, hahahah
And you ain't trippin, we really this high
Uhh

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
If you offer me all the money in the world, I wouldn't trade it for my girl
My family or the niggas that you see me riding with me outta town
Or internationally, they gon fly with me, kinda fried
Rollin' the papers so they get high with me
If I decide to give this up one day, they gon' retire with me
Enjoy the money and the fame and the power with me
And fucking hater, burn in hell
Sippin' champagne while the waiter breaking shells
Niggas scream my name, probably praying that I fail
The money so insane, gotta weigh it on a scale
(You gotta weigh it on a scale?) Cap, niggas blow that, bitches know that
Never touch blunts, chill with us once, never go back
Little homie, that's real
VVS diamonds, my stones are that ill
My watch is an Audemar, I'm smokin OG 'til my problems gone
You try to call your man he ain't got no more, probably cause I bought it all

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
As we proceed
To court bad bitches and roll good weed
Fast livin, I’m taking them hoes on trips
Go to places they never been, I’m just gettin it how I'm supposed to be
As we proceed
To court bad bitches and roll good weed
Fast livin, I’m taking them hoes on trips
Go to places they never been, I’m just gettin it how I'm supposed to be

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Uhh, Aquafina in the bong
I’m off in that Modena when I’m done, just sound the alarm
Bitch top drop like Mardi Gras beads bein thrown
Francesca you’s a mess girl, carry on
Car smelling like a pound when I pull up at the Avalon
Pull your own weight, I don’t have no time for tag-alongs
Don’t know what you yapping for, I'm stacking dough
Catalogue my closet, my belts, my watches
Cell phone in my pocket, my Blackberry biotches
Have ‘em ready, I’ll watch em, daddy back
Niggas plottin’ on the Jets but we got em
We just waiting to drop ‘em, they vexed cause we poppin’
And them hoes ain’t worry ’bout ‘em, they sure came up
What they sayin 'bout them boys from the bottom?
Paparazzi cameras spot em, flash when you see they faces
History in the making, I was high when I made it
So I can play it for them haters

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
As we proceed
To court bad bitches and roll good weed
Fast livin, I’m taking them hoes on trips
Go to places they never been, I’m just gettin it how I'm supposed to be

Go to places they never been, I’m just gettin it how I'm supposed to be

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Used to want a chain, now I got six
Used to want a Rollie like Pac now it’s on my wrist, woah
Livin’ the life niggas told me was a myth (myth)
Same niggas tryna get up on my list (what)
Since I started buzzin’, I got eighteen eleven cousins
New bitches tryna join the team and old ones that I’m cutting
Sky high class livin but niggas still grinding
Cause I’m surrounded with the same niggas and girls since I had nothin’
Now, I got signed to my idol
Seen some of my favorite rappers turn rivals
‘Ye told me kill em so a nigga gotta drop ‘em
Peep the Jesus chain he gave me since I can't keep up with Bibles
Nah, young nigga heading to the title
Where it’s at? That's the top man, these niggas gon recycle
What, my shit is like a B.I.G recital
But you can’t hold a real nigga down, that's why I keep real niggas 'round

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
As we proceed
To court bad bitches and roll good weed
Fast livin, I’m taking them hoes on trips
Go to places they never been, I’m just gettin it how I'm supposed to be

Rolling, we’re rolling!

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Riding with the steel, puffing on the purp
Overtime on you niggas, 'cause I'm goin' to work
I'm going to work, I'm going to work
Overtime on you niggas, going to work
I’m gonna get it any means necessary
'Cause you know I'm bout my paper like a secretary
I'm going to work, I'm going to work, I'm going to work

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Gotta go to court tomorrow, DA on my dick
So I'mma wear my Audemar, just to make her sick
I might go yellow Presi on her, just to make her pissed
Then go home and break a brick and break it down to bacon bits
I'm going to work I'm going to work
The phone's popping, like we on the first
We up on Neiman's, we going berserk
A nigga cross me, he going to church
Ridin through the hood, back of the 'Bach
Started in the front, now they in back of the 'Bach
No love for the haters, no rap for the rats
Velcro shorty, we strapped and they strapped
Half you niggas telling so we never sell em work
They don't wanna come and get it so we mail em work
Put my money in it so you know it better work
And my shooters with me so you know they put in work

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Riding with the steel, puffing on the purp
Overtime on you niggas, 'cause I'm goin' to work
I'm going to work, I'm going to work
Overtime on you niggas, going to work
I’m gonna get it any means necessary
'Cause you know I'm bout my paper like a secretary
I'm going to work, I'm going to work, I'm going to work

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I might go buy a boat tomorrow, just to take a trip
Big belly rude boy, bad Jamaican bitch
I head straight to Colombia, I'm talking Bogota
Ship em up to Philly, Milly living like he Gorbachev
Not the Reagen Era but a nigga making cheddar
Rayful Edmond in the mirror and I'm never telling
The game sweet soda, seats watermelon
Clip full of sunflower seeds in my Mac-11
And I steal a mothafucka's like a student felon
Bookbags full of blocks and them bitches selling
I'm going to work, I'm going to work
I'm going to work, I'm going to work

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Riding with the steel, puffing on the purp
Overtime on you niggas, 'cause I'm goin' to work
I'm going to work, I'm going to work
Overtime on you niggas, going to work
I’m gonna get it any means necessary
'Cause you know I'm bout my paper like a secretary
I'm going to work, I'm going to work, I'm going to work

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Got some youngins that will murder for a new bike
Have you looking like you're fresh up out a food fight
Spaghetti on your head, shirt ketchup red
Shooting banana clips, we ain't never scared
Niggas say they looking for me, the ain't ever there
I'm like a Metro Phone Store 'cause I'm everywhere
I'm gone get it any means necessary
'Cause you know I'm bout my paper like a secretary
Gave my nigga fifty years, forever buried
He said he gone make it home like he neva worried
He said he’s gonna make it home like in Neveruary, damn!
Free my homie Rick, and free my homie Brick
Doing hard time, love the 36
Tried to get her number, shawty she ain’t on me
Wanna fuck me now, I’m like you dirty bitch!
Rookie of the year cause I murder shit, murder!
And I'm way back, 'cause it’s Maybach

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Riding with the steel, puffing on the purp
Overtime on you niggas, 'cause I'm goin' to work
I'm going to work, I'm going to work
Overtime on you niggas, going to work
I’m gonna get it any means necessary
'Cause you know I'm bout my paper like a secretary
I'm going to work, I'm going to work, I'm going to work

[Intro]
S.O.S, she's in disguise
S.O.S, she's in disguise
There's a she wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out

[Verse 1]
A domesticated girl, that's all you ask of me
Darling, it is no joke, this is lycanthropy
The moon's awake now, with eyes wide open
My body's craving, so feed the hungry

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I've been devoting myself to you
Monday to Monday and Friday to Friday
Not getting enough retribution
Or decent incentives to keep me at it
I'm starting to feel just a little abused
Like a coffee machine in an office (Uh)
So I'm gonna go somewhere cozy to get me a lover
And tell you about it

[Chorus]
There's a she-wolf in the closet
Open up and set it free (Ah-ooh)
There's a she-wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe

[Verse 2]
Sitting across a bar, staring right at her prey
It's going well so far, she's gonna get her way
Nocturnal creatures are not so prudent
The moon's my teacher and I'm her student

[Pre-Chorus 2]
To locate the single men, I got on me a special radar
And the fire department hotline in case I get in trouble later
Not looking for cute little divos or rich city guys
I just want to enjoy (Uh)
By having a very good time
And behave very bad in the arms of a boy

[Chorus]
There's a she-wolf in the closet
Open up and set it free (Ah-ooh)
There's a she-wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe

[Bridge]
S.O.S, she's in disguise
S.O.S, she's in disguise
There's a she-wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out
S.O.S, she's in disguise
S.O.S, she's in disguise
There's a she-wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out

[Outro]
There's a she-wolf in the closet
Let it out so it can breathe

[Verse]
If you a rat or you a snitch
You shouldn’t listen to this
If you ain't talking Pittsburgh
If you ain't mention the prince
I'm sick with the spit
You pissed I get chips for this shit
This for my homies that be OT, whip full of bricks
I'm on another level, dudes gotta catch up to my ride
I'm ahead of my time
I'm a threat to you guys, why?
I’m still a student, yet I'm fluent with my rhymes
Still that best of that good shit, professional hood shit
Bill Gates cake, I won't settle for hood rich
I’m fresh cause we don't sound like that other bullshit
My team hustle, no days off
And weigh so much salt
That you might have to take a snow day off
You ain't coming close to mine, if the cops bring a snitch about you
Me on my worst day is what you pricks amount to
Talk slick like the life we can't get about you
And have dirt on you like I have some shit about you
See Wiz Khalifa’s like a teacher I could show you to
A spliff of reefer got me somewhere high up in the mountains
You claim to be S-T-A-R-S
But like you're under 21 you can't fuck with my bars
Ask about me the streets think im the youngest in charge
Pimp too, leave the club with a truck full of broads
And if its on then im crushing them all
You niggas prolly right
When you say that I ain't fUckin with y'all, dogg
I’m on a paper chase, moving unit state to state
So I let the haters hate, got about a cake to make
Money on the mind, moving at a greater pace
Hungry on the grind and I ain't eating of a paper plate
I need the finer things, came up on the rhyming game
Now they listening, take his picture in them designer frames
And they come with success some niggas gotta hate
I see you playin with me, its different, its not a game
I’m moving heavy in the trenches
Best flow, back door
When I knock any nigga senseless
I don't do much, smoke about a blunt or two or three
Gonna take more than a few bars to get through to me

[Verse 1]
Said you're all mouth and no brains, all rockstars go to heaven
You said you’ll be dead at 27, when we drunk in a English tavern
The owner poured you the Bourbon, and you drunk yourself so rotten
He got so rich he bought a Bentley, and moved himself to Devon

[Verse 2]
You started dirty dancing, and you bartended a dozen
I took you to the clinic, to get you clean but you couldn’t
Said in 2 days you're 27, and and your destiny was comin'
And your papa passed so sudden, and left you with a little somethin'

[Verse 3]
You blew that money on a mountain of drugs, and staged your self a bed in
A month later when I popped in, you're still high but the winter set in
I bought you a coffee and a muffin, and you quoted me some Lenin
I wished I was that clever, but that's what kept me coming
Your friendship did mean somethin', but you left me for nothin'
When I left, you befriended a rope, and I found you both were hanging

[Intro]
She gon have a fuckin orgasm
She gon have a fuckin orgasm

[Bridge]
I like girls that like girls
Party all night, like them white girls
But we don't like all them lil dyke girls, tryna fight girls
Relax baby, open up it's Tyga's world

[Verse 2]
All that lipgloss, she don't need that on
Cause it's gon wipe off, when you lick my balls

Put it deep what she telling me
Rock her like a baby, she gon fall asleep
After she had a fuckin orgasm
She got a fuckin orgasm

[Verse 1]
Hear the Devil callin', I can hear 'em
It's like, I get chills down my spine, when I'm near him
Man, I'm a tad too bad, I don't fear him
I don't need the preachers, I'm the high priestess
Everywhere I go, I get "Hi, nice to meet you."
Bitches know I beast this, I'm the fashionistis
And they know, I stay around the white, like a groom
Look up in the sky, I see somebody on a broom
I think I'm gettin' hi-high-hi-high, on my own supply
Yellin' "Rastafari! " when I'm ridin' by
See, I used to be the wife, of a king
Back when I was smugglin' them things, in the bing
Now that I'm a boss bitch, it's a win-win
Come to Mr. Chow's, or meet me in Chin-Chin
Now I get'cha ching & my name bells ring -
Oops, I mean my name ring bells, ding ding!

[Chorus]
I'm in Jamaica with them keys, under palm trees
The leprechaun sees, what my palm reads
And if my heart seize, please call my aunties
I think them girls tellin', I hear them boys yellin'
I'm in Jamaica with them keys, under palm trees
The leprechaun sees, what my palm reads
And if my heart seize, please call my aunties
I think them girls tellin', I hear them boys yellin'

[Bridge]
Get down, get down, get down down
Get d- get down, get down, get down down
Get down, get down, get down down
Get down, get down on the ground
Get down, get down on the ground

[Verse 2]
Man, fuck a P-O, and fuck a C-O
'Bout to "Set It Off", like Cleo
Mad, they done tapped my Treo
Bagged my skio, heard the bitch lyin' like Leo
Anyway, I'm the ninja, Kawasaki blazin'
In a kimono, "Konichiwa" to the Asians
I kick, kick, kick it like I'm Bruce Lee's son
So all of that yellin' in the street soon done
Cause if I take my ski mask off, then I'm dumbin'
The young Chaka Khan, yes - "I Am Every Woman"
And I am 'bout that coke, not what'cha put the rum in
Say a little prayer, tell the Lord that I'm comin' (comin')

[Chorus]
I'm in Jamaica with them keys, under palm trees
The leprechaun sees, what my palm reads
And if my heart seize, please call my aunties
I think them girls tellin', I hear them boys yellin'
I'm in Jamaica with them keys, under palm trees
The leprechaun sees, what my palm reads
And if my heart seize, please call my aunties
I think them girls tellin', I hear them boys yellin'

[Outro]
Can you hear them yellin'?
Comin' for me, comin' for me-e-e-e
Comin' for me, comin' for me, comin' for me

Couple niggas down for murder four couple stripes, yes
So if I say it's time to go then he goin die tonight
Brick squad, brick squad everything is brick squad, yes, yes
See in the snitch nigga *dead* make my dick hard

I rock a lot of jewlsz and plus a lot of toos
I mean a lot of chops I make tomato soupe
It's such a beautiful day to put my diamonds on display
Black and yellow diamonds catching sun rays on a sun day
Put a crease in your head, like I'm pressing jeans
Getting money here my ... no ... on the scene
Batman call catgirl out the house

Thug life, rob, steal, every day's a drug deal
Every minute precious to me, bullets big, theres mo niggas

Drive up to your house and

Okay I say that shit again, I said it once before

I glist and shine with Miss Fine
Model chick, big behind
Bad enough to skip the line, but to me she just a nine
I hop up out that double O, you can call me Mr. Bond
Bitch I am a monster, I belong on District 9
Catch me in my office doin' business
The fuck you doin'? Bullshittin'
I get all the eyes when I step inside and
They all arise when I am arivin'
Bring out the Rozay and the Ciroc and
Bring out the OJ like Johnny Cochran
I guess they on son cause my neck look like horizon
Just a million people behind me and I don't have Verizon
Man I'm chillin' wit my niggas, nigga
And a couple cool bitches
What the fuck you doin'? Bullshittin'
Me and my niggas, Say It Ain't Tone
Hundred pretty girlies singin' our song
Yeah I kick my feet up you can't say that I ain't home
And I be blowin' on that reefer you can't say that it ain't strong and
She just, she just, she just, she just want a long dick
I put it in her mouth and now that bitch look like a Conehead
When I'm done go ahead
What the fuck this is?
What the fuck you doin'? Bullshittin'

[Verse 2]
I hear, I hear, I hear man but that shit just don't compare
I tell you you the best, when I'm lookin' in the mirror
By the time y'all over here, I'm prolly over there
And by the time you ridin' what I'm ridin' on, I'm in the air
No wonder why my mind is so cloudy, I'm drowsy
My frequent flyer miles is in the thousies I'm outtie
Somewhere chillin' in Maui swimmin' with the scuba fishes
What the fuck you doin'? Bullshittin'
Nigga I be splargin
I beg my pardon
Cause y'all niggas is starvin'
Lookin for a bargain
Gone and roll that weed yeah I think it's time to spark it
Cause I be runnin' through them trees, niggas call me Tarzan
What you think we won't stop gone stop?
Silly ho I'm living out my dreams don't you dare hit that alarm clock
I'm laid up with yo' girlfriend you knockin' like what you doin' nigga?
I'm like fuck you doin'? Bullshittin'

[Outro]
I hit you with a AMC, my nigga that's a full clip

But I can't hate you
Although I have tried
Mmmm

[Chorus]

Love is stronger than pride
I still really really love you
Mmmm

Love is stronger than pride
I still really really love you
Mm mm mm mm mm

Sitting here wasting my time

Sitting here waiting for you
Would be like waiting for winter
It's gonna be cold there may even be snow

[Chorus]
I still really really love you
Love is stronger than pride
I still really really love you
Love is stronger
I still really love you
Love is stronger than pride

[Verse 1]
Okay, it's Childish Gambino, homegirl drop it like the NASDAQ
Move white girls like there's coke up my asscrack
Move black girls 'cause, man, fuck it, I'll do either
I love pussy, I love bitches, dude, I should be runnin’ PETA
In Adidas, with some short shorts, B-O-O all over me
My green is where it's supposed to be, your green is in my grocery
This Asian dude, I stole his girl, and now he got that Kogi beef
My dick is like an accent mark, it's all about the over E's
Hot like a parked car
I sound weird like "nigga" with a hard 'R'
Fly like the logo on my cousin's 440
Eatin' Oreos like these white girls that blow me
Vodka for my ladies, whiskey for a grown man
Hangin' in the islands, lookin' for Earl like Toejam
I made the beat retarded, so I'm callin' it a slow jam
Butcher and I know it, man, kill beef, go ham
These rappers are afraid of him
'Cause I'm a beast, bitch, "grrr", Invader Zim
Gambino is a call girl, fuck you, pay me
Brand new whip for these niggas like slavery
Told me I was awful and that shit did not faze me
Tell me how I suck again, my memory is hazy
“You're my favorite rapper now”, yeah, dude, I better be
Or you can fuckin, kiss my ass, Human Centipede
You wanna see my girl? I ain't that dumb
You wanna see my girl? Check Maxim
"Man, why does every black actor gotta rap some?”
I don't know, all I know is I'm the best one

[Chorus]
It's a bonfire, turn the lights out
I'm burnin' everything you mothafuckas talk about
It's a bonfire, turn the lights out
I'm burnin' everything you mothafuckas talk about

[Verse 2]
You know these rapper dudes talk shit, start killin'
Fuck that, got goons like an archvillain
I'm from the South, ain't got no accent, don't know why
So this rap is child's play, I do my name like Princess Di
Yeah, they say they want the realness, rap about my real life
Told me I should just quit, "First of all, you talk white
Second off, you talk like you haven't given up yet"
Rap's stepfather, yeah, you hate me but you will respect
I put in work, ask Ludwig
Put my soul on the track like shoes did
Played this for my cousin, now he can't even think straight
Black and white music? Now, nigga, that's a mixtape
Shoutout to my blerds, they represent the realness
Shoutout to Gambino Girls, my dick is in the building
I know you hate me 'cause your little cousin play me out
I like black girls who nerdy but when they dance they be sayin' "Ow"
I'm sorry for who followed me
Chillin' with a Filipina at your local Jollibee
Yeah, I'm in her ass like sodomy
So if you see my hand under the table, don't bother me
I don't talk soft, that's that other guy
I'm screamin' "What the fuck is up?" like I ain't seen the sky
The shit I'm doin' this year? Insanity
Made the beat then murdered it, Casey Anthony
These rappers don't know what to do
'Cause all I did was act me, like a Looney Tune
And I'll give you all of me until there’s nothing left
I swear this summer will be summer Camp, bitch

Murda dem, murda dem! (Yeah!)
Just one word, body a third of them (Nicki)
I kick kick game, can't injure Nicki (Minaj)
That's why they nick-nicknamed me, Ninja Nicki (Lewinsky!)
I'm such a yes, and you're a no no
Live with a Dragon, and wear a kimono
I'm from the Philippines, badder than Billy Jean
Guess that is why I get more head, than an a guillotine
But then I'm dumb struck 'cause you bums suck
Where the um---where the fuck is my nunchuck?
I'm in Tokyo, with the Cokio
Somebody sleepin' in my bed like Nokio
I'm gettin' ill, I been poppin' a pill again
I'm on an Island, and I'm lookin' for Gilligan
Where my Timberland? I got 'em tremblin'
Can't find my keys, but I know, I hear them jingling
You're such a Marilyn – Monroe and Manson
I'm got some heroin, wanna go dancing?
You at the door? Ok, I'm about to come down
I'm getting numb now, don't let me come down

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj (Lil Wayne)]
Sniffing on some good blow (Nicki Minaj!)
It's like I'm sippin' on the tempo
And I can't come down now (It's the president y'all and that's the mistress)
Cause I'm higher than higher than higher than a kite

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Young Moola, baby! (Yeaaah!)
I do what I does
I come through this bitch, wrist bluer, than 'cuz'
I'm so five star, Soo Woo to the bloods
And before I had a mirror, I knew who I was
I know where I'm goin', I knew where I was
Yeah, d-d-d-dirty, dirty south, see my shoe full of mud
Baby who can you trust? Who can you love?
When love kills, like somebody gave Cupid a gun?
It go (BAW!) Like you shooting for fun
And sometimes the solution is execution for some
Besides, you don't want that intrusion at one –
A.M. and the conclusion, is you losing a son
No inducing my funds, I smoke the fruitiest blunts
I mean the stupidest buds, I get stupid as duh
I swear my doobie is uh – fat, and just like it, you can get lit
Shit don't stank, when you shittin' in the bank
When her man run an errand, I'ma hit her like Hank
Look him in the eye and a nigga might blink
Aim at his brain and a nigga might think
Weezy

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj (Lil Wayne)]
Sniffing on some good blow (Young Money)
It's like I'm sippin' on the tempo (Dirty Money)
And I can't come down now (Cash Money)
Cause I'm higher than higher than higher than a kite (Young Moola, baby)

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Yo, It's the President man and the Mistress, Ms. Nicki Minaj aka. Nicki Lewinsky, yea and I am the president, shut yo mouth!

[Intro: J. Cole]
Cole World
Southside
Can’t get enough, can’t get enough
Eastside, Westside, worldwide, ride out

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Now, I ain’t got no kids yet, but this right here’s for practice
I hate to get the seats in the Benz wet, but that’s how good your ass is
Make an old man get his glasses, make Wesley pay his taxes
Then follow your moves all week on Twitter, pro'bly make a gay nigga reconsider
You're now rockin' with the best, mane, dress game down to the sex game
Won’t brag, but the boy been blessed, mane, let you play with the stick; Ovechkin
She callin', she textin', she’s fallin', but let me explain
Gotta tell your old boyfriend skate, girl, ‘cause a nigga don’t play them ex games
Nope! Straight sexing, no handcuff or arresting
And I ain’t coming off of my last name, ‘cause I really can’t take no stressing
'Bout where I done been, who I done hit, your homegirl saying, “He a bad boy.”
But I’m signed to the Roc, no time for the gossip, bitch, put down them tabloids!

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
She said
“I heard you got a main chick, a mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good and everybody knows
My homegirls tried to warn me, they tried to let me know
But what you got I need a lot, so I can’t let you go.”

[Chorus: J. Cole (Trey Songz)]
She said, “I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough of what you got, good God, you hit the spot
Try to let go but I just cannot, so don’t you stop, I need that.”

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Hey
Globetrotter, Cole hotter, even way out in London town
Hoes holla, ’cause they love my sound and I got love for the underground
Kweli, Pimp C, H-Town where Bun get down
Met a bad bitch that’ll cut all night, that’ll suck all night, you just cut off lights
Almost missed my flight, tryna get my last little nut, all right?
She be down for whatever whenever I wanna get up in the guts, all right?
Never fuss or fight, on the grind, tryna find this lettuce
I love it when you give me head, I hate it when you give me headaches

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
She said
“I heard you got a main chick, a mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good and everybody knows
My homegirls tried to warn me, they tried to let me know
But what you got I need a lot, so I can’t let you go.”

[Chorus: J. Cole (Trey Songz)]
She said, “I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough of what you got, good God, you hit the spot
Try to let go but I just cannot, so don’t you stop, I need that.”

[Verse 3:  J. Cole]
Hey, Cole World, baby, ain’t nothin' sunny, I see ‘em hating, but it ain’t nuttin' to me
I’m from the Ville where they bang for the money and carry fo’-fives, like change for a twenty
So what I look like, scurred? Them niggas over there look like nerds
Never mind that, girl, let’s make a track, I’ll beat the pussy up, that’s the hook right thurr
That’s the hook right thurr! That's the hook right thurr!
Never mind that, girl, let’s make a track, I’ll beat the pussy up, that’s the hook right thurr

[Pre-Chorus: Trey Songz]
She said
“I heard you got a main chick, a mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good and everybody knows
My homegirls tried to warn me, they tried to let me know
But what you got I need a lot, so I can’t let you go.”

[Chorus: J. Cole (Trey Songz)]
She said, “I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough, can’t get enough” (I need that)
“I can’t get enough of what you got, good God, you hit the spot
Try to let go but I just cannot, so don’t you stop, I need that.”

[Verse 1]
After the joy, half laughter the book
Of the kids favorite motherfucking chapter
No need to be a actor (Cover up with quilt)
So the fat nigga could drink my motherfucking milk
I want some gold Bapes I want a prom date
Sloppy ass musty bitch, that's overweight
I want a new piano, record deal, new pills, therapist
I'm pissed (Somebody give me a hug)
Jingle balls and I'm fucking Mrs. Clause
Have her climbing up the wall, while he givin' y'all gifts
He ain't never gave me shit
My mom bought the wrapping and the shit that influenced
Me to start rapping. It's not a joke, chilling with the Polar Bear
That used to work for coke, Santa's sniffin' coke
My Santa Letter Wrote
Fuck you, whiney Malcolm X movie, try me
And I'm stealing Harry Potter's Cloak
Middle East was his birthday, 25th I'd rather get gifts
So why the fuck would I go out my way to celebrate birthday
I'm selfish what the fuck I look like buying a gift
Hide em, bed under the couch
Rad kid done smashed they motherfucking ginger house
And Jesus don't know me, he ain't my homie
Our friendship sits on a self
Santa go and molest an elf
Prancer, Jingle, Rudolf
Drunk driving at night, a peppermint Smirnoff
Santa little buzz, and forgot to switch gears off
My childhood is here, never ever ever Smirnoff
Snowman robbing little girl, boys, for toys
And G.I. Joes, and here his fat ass go on my roof
Like Ho Ho (Ho Ho Ho)
Christmas tree's green, and this time of year clean
Make me wanna go and do things (like)
Nigga's in a tinsel, sleighbell blow whistle
Alana, Raquel, hope ya'll under the missle-toe
The house is decorated, and man I'm frustrated
Cause' I didn't get shit that I really wanted
New Years zoom like a mother fucking Mazda
But at the end I wanna' know what the fuck is Kwanzaa?

[Outro]
(What is it? Nobody Knows...Nobody Knows
Anybody?)
(O.F.M Banging on your FM.)
Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays
Fuck It, I'm still a kid
Bout' to go have a snowball fight
In the middle of LA
Steal some Christmas trees, set em' on fire
Eat some gingerbread cookies
Shit, I don't know
It's the time to enjoy life
You Know?
Happy Holidays from us at Odd Future
And, Fuck you. Fuck You. Fuck You
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bring me some haze

[Verse 1 Lupe Fiasco:]
I tilt mine to the left, it's just the westside of him
Don't ride nothing but know plenty people, peoples that ride something
Decided cousin, I should describe the lives of him
Some wise, drive Chevy's with gold Dayton's in the tires of 'em
But first let me tell you where son grown
Grew up 'round GD, CVL's, Black Souls and Unknowns
Hanging hat, banging sacks, slanging with guns on
Forced to drop the forks or you gotta run home
Or you gotta run anyway after you drop the folks
Cause they was really folks looking for somebody to jump on
Wars, lords shoot up all the corners they hung on
Hear the squeezing ring for my region brother to come home
Violations, laws, lessons, sessions and mandates
Picnic collections, lit sign throwing the handshakes
That's why I stay, drop eyes where I play
GDN in they fades wear the 150 sittin' sideways

[Hook: x2]
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bring me some haze

[Jay-Z:]
You know the boy slam Bentley doors
I been riding Lexus since '94
Before I had a deal I was on a world tour
In a town near you showed up with raw
Fast forward a couple years I growed up some more
Closed up the store, sewed up the floor
Rose up the charts, sold up with the 4
Sold 5, sold 6, sold 30 more
Now I'm a kilo in the game like I was before
My life repeating like words in the corridor
(Hello, hello, hello, hello)
Before I open the door you let me know if you are close kinfolk with the law
If not let's further explore
Same shit different toilet, yeah, I know you heard it before
I was the youngest of four, pop couldn't take it no more
Stayed together for the kids they couldn't fake it no more
Left me naked in the streets I had to take me a course
Not only made me a man, it made me a boss
The world chico, maybe it's yours
Maybe it's your time to die, get so hardcore
Just be a man of your word, you got your word and your balls
Before you act on a word please consider the source
Please remember to floss, anyday could be yours
Death don't discriminate; eliminates all

[Verse 2 Lupe Fiasco:]
I seen 'em brawl for it, write on the wall for it
Get kicked out the mall for it, run from the law for it
See things they should've never saw for it
Long as it's all well, almighty, alrighty, they all for it, uh
BlackHawk fitted, get hit in the jaw for it
Blue and Black Jordan sportin' might get you applause for it
Peace treaty for like a week if Chief and them call for it
A hundred and fifty deep in the streets saying ya'll broke it
But what started that was a shorty walking down the ave in a Starter cap
Pop said he ain't want me having no part of that
Those happenings with the hats and things
Moved me out south now all my homies is Latin Kings
Teaching me spanish, Lowrider magazines
Black and gold bandanas, tagging crowns up on the scene
That was the age, kinda how Lupe was made
Homies from Paxtown to Terror, New Era sittin sideways

[Hook: x2]
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bring me some haze

[Lupe Fiasco:]
Uh, See from youth, I wasn't a stranger
Pops schooled him to the El-Rukn's plus the P Stone Rangers
And as I grew up knew most of what had been threw up
Disciples loved the Geto Boys cause they was talking to Hoover
Time versus life is all a process
Drive-by's, gang fights and lockdowns had us scared of the projects
Couple Arab Knights and solid 4's I knew, thought that the Moes was cool
They said salaam alaikum too
Told my out of town friends to take off they hat
That they couldn't wear that, in the places that I was taking them to
My homies was breaking in, so I was breaking in too
If they started chasing them then they was chasing me too
Probably all got cousins, brothers, sisters and loved ones
That probably died for nothing, or shaken up or something
To the mother's that paid, to my homies in the grave
Keep a glitterd 150 in your memory homie sittin sideways

[Hook:]
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze
On a Sunday night I might bring me some haze
E-Ever seen a girl so bad that a, a, a, a n, n, n, nigga might

Give her the keys, give her the keys

[Intro: Girl talking in Swahili]

[Verse 1]
I should've been a better man
Instead of wasting time, spending my life searching for the finer things, woah
You always gave me another chance to make it right
But I didn't deserve 'cause I didn't understand

[Chorus]
And I feel so bad
'Cause you wouldn't do the same to me but I know what your weakness is, is, is
And you feel so mad
And now you're on an open road, so gone, not looking back, back, back, back

[Verse 2]
I thought I had you on a leash
Like I could do whatever I wanted to when I wanted to and you was gonna wait for me, baby, no
And now the tables have turned and now I feel like you're the master
And I'm on the strings, you're in control of me

[Chorus]
And I feel so bad
Now you're doing it to me 'cause you know what my weakness is, is
And you feel so mad
And now I'm on an open road, tryna go, but I'm looking back, back, back

[Post-Chorus]
(Way-oh-oh) I'm looking for her
(Way-oh-oh) I'm tryna find her
(Way-oh-oh) I really need her
(Way-oh-oh) I think I love her
(Way-oh-oh) I'm looking for her
(Way-oh-oh) I'm tryna find her
(Way-oh-oh) I really need her
(Way-oh-oh) I think I love her

[Bridge]
You can blame it all on me
I know it's like this because of me
And now I'm just like a hitchhiker waiting for a ride
With no cars in sight

[Chorus]
And it feels so bad
'Cause you wouldn't do the same to me 'cause I know what your weakness is, yeah
And I feel so mad and now you're on an open road
And now you're on an open road, long gone, I can't have you back

[Post-Chorus]
(Way-oh-oh) I'm looking for her
(Way-oh-oh) I'm tryna find her
(Way-oh-oh) I really need her
(Way-oh-oh) I think I love her
(Way-oh-oh) I wanna see ya
(Way-oh-oh) Ooh, I don't ever wanna leave ya
(Way-oh-oh) I wanna keep ya
(Way-oh-oh) I think I love her

[Remy Banks]
Pack the purp in for the bong rips
Still floating, never landed from my last trip
Yes, I bought, taking brain stimulation: inhale
And exhalation on a fuzzy herb tree
High THC levels got me lifted like a levee
Walking in a cloud defying laws of gravity
On the left side, moms hit me with the 3rd eye
Psychadelic shit, have you seeing colors in tie-dye
No Woodstock, no one was acid trippin
Straight head highs, what white widow be hitting
On some Goku shit, cruising on a flying nimbus
My mind is sight-seeing, wish I could see my vision
Under the influence, it's the shit I be creating
Scheming sour, do or die, it got a nigga faded
When it comes to quality, of course I'm feeling glorious
Only smoke high grade, call us valedictorians

Gonna set the night on fire

[Domo Genesis]
Hooty-hoo little mommy
Tryna roll this sticky up with you little mama
Got a zippy in my Bape bag
You brought your own shit, you say "match"
I love that kind of shit, you get a day pass
I got a show so we could smoke and I'mma skate fast
100 miles per hour lifestyle: no brake pads
Can you say "swag"? Camouflage everything
I swear I had to live my former life in the 70s
This is audio smoke, you are inhaling it
So fucking cool, I'm just living my legacy
As night falls with my Ray Bans on
You too high-headed homes, and you can't go on
Never teppin only stop to rest my head on the wall
We out in New York, but it's still Cali I'm on
I'mma talk pot every fucking verse I get on
I'm a pothead, fuck you, this is my song..

[Sample: Katt Williams & Unknown]
Some of y'all need to just smoke some weed and see if it don't help the quality of your motherfuckin' life. I know, I see some of y'all. Look, I understand, if you ain't smokin' weed 'cause you got a good job, then by all means make your paper, boo-boo, but if you ain't got no job and you not smokin' weed, I don't know what the fuck you are doin' with your life. I really don't. I really don't. Don't give me that shit about "It's a drug!", it ain't no motherfuckin' drug, I done done the research, it's just a plant. It just grow like that, and if you just so happen to set it on fire, there are some effects. Do you want to get high?

[Intro]
This intro's fuckin' funny as hell
I wanna get blunted, my brother
Tick-tock motherfuckers
Greetings
I wanna get blunted, my brother
I hope you're high if you're listenin' to this shit
Hey
Hey, you
Why'd you stop rollin' up that weed?
Yeah, that's right

[Chorus]
Some days I be feelin' like I am the shit (I am the shit)
Wearin' clothes right out the package
Lookin' how nice they fit (How nice they fit)
And I swear I'ma be the fuckin' dopest
As long as I can stay up on my grind (Stay up on my grind)
I'ma always know where my home is (Home is)
I've got a Pittsburgh state of mind (State of mind)

[Verse 1]
Hey
Ayo, I'm comin' a—, comin' a—, comin' a—, comin' a—, comin' around again
Runnin' a—, runnin' around with them
Me and a thousand of my friends
Gettin' lifted, dazed and confused, and controllin' this stick shift
I’ve been workin' hard, baby, feelin' like it's my sixth shift
Dealin' with different situations, gettin' a bit of congratulations
Sick with the rhymes, splittin' your minds, feelin' the good vibrations
Excitement, you see these different places I'm invited
While you writin', it's in the people’s ears, they callin' you Tyson
The nicest you've seen in a while
Believe it, the people the reason I'm out
They showin' me love, and open me up
That’s why I see 'em and greet 'em with smiles
Shorty be lettin' me into her house
Pickin' her up, then dickin' her down
They passin' me weed, relaxin' with me
They heard that the kid was the chillest around
Somewhere in Pittsburgh, kickin' it back, watchin' the Steelers
Put your Reggie Bush away, we got some real herb
Shorty a weed ho, so nah, I don't feel her
'Cause I'm just on to the next, don't get your feelings hurt

[Chorus]
Some days I be feelin' like I am the shit (I am the shit)
Wearin' clothes right out the package
Lookin' how nice they fit (How nice they fit)
And I swear I'ma be the fuckin' dopest
As long as I can stay up on my grind (Stay up on my grind)
I'ma always know where my home is (Home is)
I've got a Pittsburgh state of mind (State of mind)

[Verse 2]
Hey, hey
A different city every day, the same youngin' though
Hoes from the bungalows who wanna drop and touch they toes
Lookin' for some money, we ain't gonna give 'em nothin', no
It's big pimpin' over here , where the fuck you go?
I be foolin' around, chillin' and passin' the doobie around
Out on the road, 'bout to be blowed
Everyone know I'm a fountain with flow
Up at the Telly, I'm countin' my dough
Makin' this money ,you out with your ho
Gettin' a couple of thousand a show
So if you still don't, then act like you know
Never done heard of a rapper before
Rappin' so rapid they clappin' like, "Oh!"
That man Mac on a roll, they jumpin' with joy, see 'em tappin' they toes
Told you that no one can spit it like I
Out gettin' money, you sittin' inside
Never are they ever sick of my rhyme
Need to be chiefin' this piff, gettin' high, woah
Ha, maybe I'ma slow it down
This shit blowin' your mind, I got the dopest sound
You better start rollin' up, the Most Dope around
I'm so high, high, not even close to down

[Chorus]
Some days I be feelin' like I am the shit (I am the shit)
Wearin' clothes right out the package
Lookin' how nice they fit (How nice they fit)
And I swear I'ma be the fuckin' dopest
As long as I can stay up on my grind (Stay up on my grind)
I'ma always know where my home is (Home is)
I've got a Pittsburgh state of mind (State of mind)

[Outro]
If any of you are students of the pop music field, then you all know that the way to make a fortune is to come out with an entirely new sound. Of course, that isn't so easy to do. Half the time it happens by accident. For instance—

[Hook]
Ain't no use in tryin to lie
You know we be ridin' fly
All that stuff you tryin to buy
Boy you know we be twice as fly
We do this
I'll show you how to do this
I'm probably the coolest
I'll show you how to do this
I'll show you how to do this shit

[Verse 1]
I got a drop 430, rims so purty
Shut ya lil gallardo down closed curtain
Ya got a Murcielago I got a McLaren for it
Balla of the year I oughta win a award
I got money offshore that I made off tour
Cash stashed in a paper bag from a whore
Some from the dro, some all blow
Never go broke but I still want more
Ya ain't gettin' nothing pimpin if ya ain't gettin' dough
Ya got a bitch n ya wonder why she ain't gettin' low
But she freakin wit fo'
Shit if you was tryin to be fly I suggest try a little more nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Who ya ever seen under thirty this fly
Playa house south beach top floor its a tie
And this'll never stop I'll do this shit til I die
Then after that consider me a ribbon in the sky
I'm G4 flyin' big boat buyin
Land in miami then I sail to a island
My Cali crew high in the hills I ain't lyin'
Man them bitches get high in anything they tryin'
I got cars I don't know about money I don't know about
3 or 4 movies get a 100K a show about
10 mil in real estate make them niggas really hate
What I care about it I ain't like them niggas anyway

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm a fool with the bitches I talk they listen
Funny thing all I gotta say is lets get it
And my mouth piece sweet but my dick game vicious
Plus I'm paid but they already rich they ain't trippin'
She can tell I'm fly first time she ride wit me
S65 who ride the 550
King worldwide God to my city
Yea them other niggas say that they hard but not really
Coupe super clean shut all the cars down
I got 50 g's on me i'll tear the mall down
Use to be in the ?? in the summer home now
One in Cabo one in miami think i'll go to rome now

[Hook 2X]

[Intro: Tyga]
Pussy Talkin' like
Pussy Talkin' like

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Ay Babe, why you puttin us on display?
Bringing up old shit in front of all her friends
And trying to start today with arguments
Trying to relax like Parliaments, you doin the opposite
Texting Kesha like,"Man, I think this nigga be cheating"
I'm late working, I know I didn't come home that evening
Calling my phone, attitudes, heavy breathing
I mean whats the reason? Or was that your menstrual speaking?
I ain't gamin', just tired of fakin' no patience be a Rider like Isaiah
Thomas, Clay Aiken no gay shit, ass naked
Commando baby, she got my dick motivated

[Hook: Tyga]
We waking up in the middle of the night
Fuck and make up right after we fight
Pussy Talkin' like (We-We-Well Done)
Pussy Talkin' like (We-We-Well Done)
Man she always waking up in the middle of the night
Fuck and make up right after we fight
Pussy Talkin' like (We-We-Well Done)
Pussy Talkin' like (We-We-Well Done)

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Uh, lay it down, bend it over like strippers open
Water gun dick shoot you now you super soakin'
Coming down your chimney, call it Santa working
I brought some gifts for you, mango flavored lotion
Wetter than a loofa (loofa) on your momma sofa
Stretch it out, Rosa Acosta
I do this shit, have you cumming over and over
Again, like a maid service clean her perfect
I ain't perfect, most of them bitches don't deserve me
I had my moments, but most of them bitches all be thirsty
They ain't worth it
Block them all, like stage curtains
Knock em' off, like fake purses
I ain't tricking but you got it
Loving you being honest
Hard to be honest when most of the time your indecisive
I'm tired of fighting
Let it go, close your eyelids
Open the morning fresh, and we vibing

[Hook: Tyga]

Finish him
Wolf Gang

Golf Wang

Swag me out, bitch
In an $8000 outfit
Y'all hear these niggas talking, it ain't about shit
I'm on 15, these niggas on Cloud 6
Tryna get to 9, I'm who they get behind
Thirsty to get some shine
But bitch, you can't skip the line
And time won't even give you minutes
Cause this shit is mine
You live that ad-lib life, with the unscripted lines
I kill em all, just ball, no evidence behind
My steps too complex, you can't convict the crime
I'm just a criminal, high to my last breath
In and out of cities pushing missies till no gas left
Street ballin, I was rushing out my Timex
And I'm about that fucking scratch paper like a math test
That good shit is forming back, Rogaine
And they so plain I can't feel em: cocaine
When it's in the nasal and you're facially numb mane
Snorting all them five dollar verses, them shit's is chump change
I'm on my grind, that's some cliche shit
But if they see me anywhere, my enemies hate quick
Like "he ain't even swag, nigga, he can't spit" and
"Everytime he come around we feel like we ain't shit"
Save the chit-chatter, it's money to get after
Cheating in the book of life
A nigga about to skip chapters
From flat broke to phat quotes, I'm a real bastard
And I smoke weed til I feel like a Zen master
It's certified homicide, I'm a clit' master
High class pretty bitch basher, big kush asher
They told me Domo you're the chosen one
Convincing every single bitch that they the only one
This shit was cute even way before the song begun
If I'm not a real nigga, then show me one
But bitch, don't show me none

[Verse 1]
I'm 'bout the swag, I'm 'bout the ice, I'm 'bout to cop me one tonight
I don't really care the price, 'cause my bankroll right
Ridin' on Toyola, on Pinolla, that's just how we get it though
Choppin' ola, I was holdin', forty-five, listen though
Forty-five, take your stash to buy them new Dickie's, man
And a S.O.D. charm piece, man, that's fifty grand
Arab tatted up and gathered up the whole guap
S.O.D. gang six figures quarter-million copped, 'cause

[Chorus]
I'm 'bout the cars, I'm 'bout the swag
I'm 'bout the whip, I'm 'bout the rag
I'm 'bout the bricks, I'm 'bout the flips
I'm 'bout the chips, I'm 'bout the dips
I'm 'bout the stacks, stacks (Tall), stacks, stacks (Tall)
I'm 'bout the stacks, stacks (Tall), stacks, stacks (Tall)
I'm 'bout the cars, I'm 'bout the swag
I'm 'bout the whip, I'm 'bout the rag
I'm 'bout the bricks, I'm 'bout the flips
I'm 'bout the chips, I'm 'bout the dips
I'm 'bout the stacks, stacks (Tall), stacks, stacks (Tall)
I'm 'bout the stacks, stacks (Tall), stacks, stacks (Tall)

[Verse 2]
I'm 'bout the bank, I'm 'bout to vault
I'm 'bout the this ain't what you thought
I'm ridin' clean, I got guap
I'm doin' me I'm on the top
I'm 'bout the ice, I'm 'bout the shine
I'm 'bout the work, I'm 'bout the grind
I'm 'bout to get 'em, got 'em, see 'em, saw
Gettin' every dollar though
When you see me pop your collar
I'ma throw out every dollar
Soulja Boy's not a scholar, bank is full of million dollars
Get 'em S.O.D. we got 'em, scream S.O.D. we holla
Too much swag, yes, we ballin', I'm a money hauler

[Chorus]
I'm 'bout the cars, I'm 'bout the swag
I'm 'bout the whip, I'm 'bout the rag
I'm 'bout the bricks, I'm 'bout the flips
I'm 'bout the chips, I'm 'bout the dips
I'm 'bout the stacks, stacks (Tall), stacks, stacks (Tall)
I'm 'bout the stacks, stacks (Tall), stacks, stacks (Tall)
I'm 'bout the cars, I'm 'bout the swag
I'm 'bout the whip, I'm 'bout the rag
I'm 'bout the bricks, I'm 'bout the flips
I'm 'bout the chips, I'm 'bout the dips
I'm 'bout the stacks, stacks (Tall), stacks, stacks (Tall)
I'm 'bout the stacks, stacks (Tall), stacks, stacks (Tall)

[Verse 3]
Man, I'm a trap-a-holic rap-a-holic hustler
Down on your decimal, make me a customer
S.O.D. machine don't need no cash register
All the money added up, pass me the duffle
Bag full of grands, a couple bands, understand
I'm the man when I land overseas in Japan
I seen you wishin' he'da quit it you can't get like me
A lot of rappers mad 'cause they can't make no hits like me

[Chorus]
I'm 'bout the cars, I'm 'bout the swag
I'm 'bout the whip, I'm 'bout the rag
I'm 'bout the bricks, I'm 'bout the flips
I'm 'bout the chips, I'm 'bout the dips
I'm 'bout the stacks, stacks (Tall), stacks, stacks (Tall)
I'm 'bout the stacks, stacks (Tall), stacks, stacks (Tall)
I'm 'bout the cars, I'm 'bout the swag
I'm 'bout the whip, I'm 'bout the rag
I'm 'bout the bricks, I'm 'bout the flips
I'm 'bout the chips, I'm 'bout the dips
I'm 'bout the stacks, stacks (Tall), stacks, stacks (Tall)
I'm 'bout the stacks, stacks (Tall), stacks, stacks (Tall)

[Outro]
Cars, swag, whip, rag
Bricks, flips, chips, dips
Stacks (Tall), stacks, stacks, stack (Tall)
I'm 'bout the stacks, stacks (Tall), stacks, stacks (Tall)
I'm 'bout the cars, swag, whip, rag
Bricks, flips, chips, dips
Stacks (Tall), stacks, stacks, stack (Tall)
I'm 'bout the stacks, stacks (Tall), stacks, stacks (Tall)

[Verse 1]
A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain in
Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but boy, they pour when

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, ooh no, no, no
I've been thinkin' bout you, you know, know, know
I've been thinkin' bout you, do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

[Chorus]
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

[Verse 2]
No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though, I'm lying down

[Pre-Chorus]
Thinkin' 'bout you, ooh no, no, no
I've been thinkin' bout you, you know, know, know
I've been thinkin' bout you, do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

[Chorus]
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

[Bridge]
Yes, of course, I remember, how could I forget (How could I forget?) how you feel? (How you feel)
You know you were my first time, a new feel
It won't ever get old, not in my soul, not in my spirit, keep it alive
We'll go down this road 'til it turns from color to black and white

[Chorus]
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeahhh

A roof to rug type of brotha
Fly head to toe (Woo)
I got a lot of swag
Need a professional
And get this doggy bag
Let's get some head to go
Yeah, I rap
But all the hoes wanna sing to me
Do a couple things to me
Make her bring the team to me
I don't wanna fuck (Nope!)
It might seem bougie (It might)
Your little attitude
Probably got a mean chewy (Wow)
You a bad bitch
With a couple bad friends
I could let you rock the mic
She can do the ad libs
They say I'm arrogant
Nah ho, I'm gettin paid (Money)
Shine, while them young boys in the shade
So your best bet's to hop your ass in the 'Lade
Fix your doobie up
And start to chew me up
You wanna screw me, what?
Fuck your old man
Gettin top notch with no hand, 'cause

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Shorty, what you doin' tonight?

I know that you might
I know that you might
See I'm tryin' to get a chewy tonight
Tonight
A good night

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
And that's exactly what I tell the bitch
Ain't got the time to ease your mind
I'm on some other shit
Know what you're fuckin with? (What?)
A young star, baby
Ever met a nigga like me? (Nope!)
Not at all, baby (Yeahhh)
A coach player
I could show you how to ball, baby
And live today
Cause I ain't worried about tomorrow, baby (Nah)
You heard my song lately
You seen my face around
So now it's you and me
So take this good weed and break it down
The spot poppin'
Shorty talkin' bout skating now
And give me brains
Let me know just what she thinking 'bout (Wow)
Burning trees
Courtesy of my Jamaican pal
Gettin' all this money
With these hundreds I could make a pile
Now I could make you smile
Or I can make you moan
Turn you into my number one fan
If I take you home
Want me to break you off?
I'm thinking more about the money
The money's what I'm thinking 'bout

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Shorty, what you doin' tonight?
Doin' tonight?
Doin' tonight?
I'm hollerin' cause you lookin' right
You lookin' right

Keep sayin' that you wouldn't

[Outro: Wiz Khalifa]
It's The Prince
Two, yep
Two, Two, Two
This the 4-1-2
Say, Two
Yeah
Sing, Two
Ohh

[Verse 1]
I remember being immortal
I thought that I was
I wanted to conquer the world
Before I could drive

I remember when you were born
Ohhh, how happy I was
Cause If it didn't go as I planned it
At least you'd double my chances

[Bridge]
And it's no pressure, man
Cause you're special
I know you wanna get big and strong quick
But don't skip one second (Orion)

[Hook]
If I could buy back the years
O-O-Orion
I would empty my pockets here (On everything)
O-Orion
Make my regrets disappear
O-O-Orion
Boy I'm jealous of you I’ll admit it
But promise big bro one thing
That you won't go wasting time
(O) won't go wasting time
(no) that you won't go wasting time
(o) Won't go wasting time
Don't go wasting it

[Verse 2]
You gotta know you hit the lotto (lotto)
Cause they don't make em like mamma no more
Hug her and tell her that you love her
That's good time spent

And when your outside running
It's ok to ask where you're going
So you're never back where you started
Wondering where time went

[Bridge]
And it's no pressure, man
Cause you're special
I know you wanna get big and strong quick
But don't skip one second (Orion)

[Hook]
If I could buy back the years
O-O-Orion
I would empty my pockets here (On everything)
O-Orion
Make my regrets disappear
O-O-Orion
Boy, I'm jealous of you i’ll admit it
But promise big bro one thing
That you won't go wasting time X2
(O) won't go wasting time
(no) that you won't go wasting time
Won't go wasting time
Don't go wasting it

[Chorus]
If we could know where we was goin' to go
We'd probably never see tomorrow
So if I keep on makin' love to these songs
Then I'ma be good for the rest of my life (My life)
Hey, some people just don't want it
Ayy, whatever it is, whatever it is
But I think I got it
Ayy, whatever it is, whatever it is

[Verse 1]
Ayy, whatever it is, they gettin' it straight
I'm too obsessed, too dedicated, never escape
I ain't scared, I'ma go in lookin' like I'm glowin'
Runnin' on beats, you show me your feet, if you ever be down to flowin'
Now I got a notion, I'ma put this into motion
Speedin' through the present tryin' to get there and coach them
Hopes the smoke man will be there soon
For now the music up loud and the beat on smooth
I'm just rhymin', spittin' so efficient
Keepin' the tradition while seekin' to be different
Just dropped K.I.D.S., but I'm a man of many words
You had to do it big, but couldn't never stop the work
Now you heard my words, so your bubble gon' burst
Yeah, we on Third, but say, "What up?" to the homies on First
If I can, I'ma kick it, rip it just 'cause I love it
Now they see me, ask me to spit it right out in public

[Chorus]
If we could know where we was goin' to go
We'd probably never see tomorrow
So if I keep on makin' love to these songs
Then I'ma be good for the rest of my life (My life)
Hey, some people just don't want it
Ayy, whatever it is, whatever it is
But I think I got it
Ayy, whatever it is (Ayy), whatever it is

[Verse 2]
Yo, rappers got time that they wastin', hatin'
When they could focus on they own grind, skatin'
They mad I got fans and they mad I got love
'Cause me and music fit like a glove, so snug
All you angry muhfuckers go and form a club
'Cause when you come around me, it ain't nothin' but love
I got girls givin' hugs, people dappin' me up
And you in the corner, like, "Ah man, Mac sucks!"
Been a long grind and a little bit of luck
Feelin' blessed every day for the way I'm comin' up
I can promise you this, I ain't even close to done
Just pray to God that I'm safe when the soldiers come
They hear me, they forgettin' if I'm old or young
Got this music on lock, but I open up
All the time 'cause my bars and my rhymes be my lifestyle
Blowin' white clouds, I'm gettin' high right now

[Chorus]
If we could know where we was goin' to go
We'd probably never see tomorrow
So if I keep on makin' love to these songs
Then I'ma be good for the rest of my life (My life)
Hey, some people just don't want it
Ayy, whatever it is, whatever it is
But I think I got it
Ayy, whatever it is, whatever it is

[Outro]
Haha, it's Most Dope in the—
Blowin' smoke in a—
Keep my thumb held high
'Cause it's the Best Day Ever
Yeah, we gon' let it fade out like this
And let it fade out right like this, hey
Crazy Mane, with the crazy chains
Got these bitches at the telly doing crazy thangs
What you bitches know about the Gucci Mane?

HOLIDAY SEASON!

[Verse 1 - Gucci Mane]
? ain't a thang, call me Gucci Mane
I got these bitches taking pictures of my candy chain
I'm just a rich, wealthy nigga, kind of weird and strange
But I stay dead fly like a private plane
If you don't know about the ki, then I must explain
Everything that I got, owe it to cocaine
I'm insane in the brain like Saddam Hussein
I'm fire: propane, I'm a boiling flame
I came, I conquered, I did my thang
Dropped my chain, then I changed the game
Two dames on the train, got that English brain
Cause my money real long like a Marta train

[Hook - Gucci Mane]
Is your camera ready?
Hold your camera steady, hold your camera steady
I stay camera ready

[Verse 2 - Gucci Mane]
Gucci Guwop up in the drop playing 2Pac
Taking 2 shots of Ciroc, then drop some ?
Taking me some blocks off the top, I gotta re-rock
42 grand in my pants, now that's a Teton
The hustler don't stop on my block
They sell sheet rock
Kick you square dead in your ass until you kick rocks
Gram after gram, yes I am, I got a weed spot
Last couple days it been hotter than a teapot
Way to make bills off the deal, I got the fig out
Niggas got mills on the deal, I pulled the Sig out
Half of a bill off this shit, then I'm a nigga
Count all my money with my chain, then we gon pig

[Hook]
Is your camera ready?
Hold your camera steady, hold your camera steady
I stay camera ready

[Verse 3 - Gucci Mane]
It's the crazy Mane with the crazy chains
Got these bitches at the telly doing crazy thangs
I dunn camouflaged the flow so it's pure ?
Got a deal for the labor, so it's more to gain
I am so untame, y'all niggas are lame
Treat your bitches like a whore, treat em all the same
You gon take her to the store, by the bitch a ring
She gon beg me for some more, want a catchy drank
60 grand in my pocket, that's a drop-top Stang
What you bitches know about the Gucci Mane?

If you ain't getting money, you should be ashamed!

On, and on, and on, and on, and
We just drink and smoke until the morning
You're homegirl's texting you, ignoring them
Hit the weed, giggle a little, then you get horny
I hit the weed, get on my mission, and then I'm goin' in
Knowin damn well they got boyfriends
Til they get the front door, asking which floor I'm on
I'm at the top, polo socks and pajamas on
She smoke chronic, know the lyrics to all my songs
It's like I died and went to heaven, me and all my dogs
That's why we sip champaign til the bottles gone
Roll weed on ya, take the bitches, I don't follow y'all

[Hook]
I can never make up this if I wanted to
It's real talk what I'm saying to you
I don't wanna wake up, knowing just one thought of you

So will you co-star with me?
Cuz my life is like a movie

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Champagne parties in my hotel
Her friends don't even smoke, but they diggin' the smell
Ex-boyfriend ringin' ya cell
But every effort to save you's to no avail
Nuthin' but starter's on my team nigga coach Phil
And all we do is get high and watch the Adult Swim
Relatively fly like a meteor or spaceship
Party every night, and early morning get wasted
All the way 100 you others niggas are make-shift
Roll that rapper weed, you smoke and don't wanna taste it
Lets face it
She wanna fly where the planes is
Got her testin' out all of my trees, myth blazers
Champagne before we hit the papers

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Kev tha Hustla]
We stay smokin' that la-la-la
Easy rider, joint roller, my 9-5
You can prolly smell it in the car when we ridin' by
More like all the way up, we ain't kinda high
We more than fly, introduce you to the gang members
That's taylor, like blood, no gang members
No names enter, and now you on champagne land

Goin' nowhere for awhile, I got good snickers
Now you wanna mingle, heard young single
Big face chips baby, stack my pringles

And we ain't takin' no prisoners, now you jealous
In ya state please make sure the weed great
Fresh produce, purple and green crates
Groove, crisp bills in my jean pants
Telly room prolly doin' the Uncle Snoop dance, yea

[Hook x2]
Perfect daughter
Had everything you ever wanted
In you
Planned with false hopes
Made your insecurities showed
It wasn't but you say
Made no difference
I'm hoping that some day
And with this change

She knows
I really hope that she knows
What she could be
She knows
I really hope that she knows
Is out to be

She's like the perfect daughter
She's never had anything given
Weren't careful
Now you have a son to hold
It wasn't but you say
Made no difference
I'm hoping that some day
And with this change

She knows
I really hope that she knows
What she could be
She knows
I really hope that she knows
Is out to be

[Chorus]
Baby girl, roll down the window
I love to see your hair float when the wind blow
Even if the money been slow
Ayy, to you it don't matter, 'cause you're still gon' ride with me
You're still gon' ride with me
I say you still gon' ride with me
I know you're still gon' ride with me, hey

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the life of a nice brother
Light skind-ed, black father, white mother
Tried to be a player, found out I'm a slight lover
Come from Carolina, I'm fly, I'm a Wright Brother
Went away to school looking for the right lover
You know, someone that you could cut and never worry 'bout a rubber
She had a man, I be damned, think I might love her
Thought about her ass for the whole damn Summer
Man I even memorized her whole damn number
This is my semester dog, I'm coming to arrest her
Y'all you know, handcuff her, her ex man, fuck him
Oh nah don't be appalled man, that nigga was a dog
So it's me now, and she be everywhere I be now
I wonder, should I tell her what her fella wanna be now?
The dreams I been dreaming and them things I wanna see now
Do that make you wanna leave or would you still hold me down?

[Chorus]
Baby girl, roll down the window
I love to see your hair float when the wind blow
Even if the money been slow
Ayy, to you it don't matter, 'cause you're still gon' ride with me
You're still gon' ride with me
I say you still gon' ride with me
I know you're still gon' ride with me, hey

[Post-Chorus]
(Just like a star)
Cause baby girl you shine (just like a star)
And we gon' do it big (just like a star)
And maybe get a crib (just like a star)
'Ey maybe we can live (just like a star)

[Verse 2]
Hey, for you I always had an admiration
We lost touch but you never left my imagination
Congratulations on your graduation
Oh now it's time to hit the real world, filled with all them résumés and applications
Man, but ain't nobody calling you back
You say it's cause you a woman and even more cause you black, imagine that
The weight of everything on your plate
You got the world on your back baby, if you can relate, man I feel for you
'Ey has this world got too real for you?
Your old friends say you changed but I still know you
You that same old girl I used to take home from school
Tryna look cool, forgot I had the brake on, damn
Time passed and you done grew up
And yeah, it's just like I told you baby look I done blew up
But the money and this little bit of fame ain't changed me
So holla when you need me, I bet you you'll get the same me

[Chorus]
Baby girl, roll down the window
I love to see your hair float when the wind blow
Even if the money been slow
Ayy, to you it don't matter, 'cause you're still gon' ride with me
You're still gon' ride with me
I say you still gon' ride with me
I know you're still gon' ride with me, hey

[Post-Chorus]
(Just like a star)
Cause baby girl you shine (just like a star)
And we gon' do it big (just like a star)
And maybe get a crib (just like a star)
'Ey maybe we can live (just like a star)

[Verse 3]
Just like a star that's in my sky
Just like an angel off my page
You have appeard to my life
It feels like we never be the same
Damn and it's been, way too long
Can't find the words to write this song
Hey, uh, still I wonder why
But it ain't what I do
Hey, we do it all the time
Goin' out my mind
Man, damn

[Chorus]
Baby girl, roll down the window
I love to see your hair float when the wind blow
Even if the money been slow
Ayy, to you it don't matter, 'cause you're still gon' ride with me
You're still gon' ride with me
I say you still gon' ride with me
I know you're still gon' ride with me, hey

Just like a star
Just like a star
Just like a star
Just like a star

[Intro]
Yeah
Fresh off the mother fucking broadcast
And I'm here, fuego nigga
Yeah, hey, uh, it's happening fast
Yeah, uh

[Verse]
I told niggas on the low, they ain't hear it though
Boy that man in the mirror is a miracle
Hey wipe your face, momma told you no more tears would flow
We eating better than we was a few years ago
Sent you Western Union on my pay day, a week later it's mayday
So you returned the favor, we stayed afloat like some sailors
Bill collectors blowing us up, they couldn't fade us
Bitch I made straight A's, go ahead, and try to degrade us, haters
But this one's funny: man one year later I was on them phones
Collecting money, a lesson from me: everybody's got a story dog
Unfortunately learned I can't do nothing for you dog
I'm trying to run the whole game like a morning jog
With hits like a porno blog
Not hopping out the shower to make ten dollars an hour
Ain't judging though, to each his own
You pay your bills and raise your kids inside a decent home
More power to you
But a message to you fuck niggas
I hope your kids grow up and never wanna fuck with you
This punk nigga knocked up two hoes at the same time
And told this nigga they was lying dog, they ain't mine
That's cold blooded but ain't nothing new
Same old, fuck it though, what's up with you?
If you made it this far listening without skipping
Then I gotta show love, don't worry I'm just venting
The late night thoughts of a nigga on a mission
And I rock my girl to sleep in missionary position
Tuck that ass in and then I went and grabbed a pen
And now you have it, words flowing like magic, it's truly accurate
You niggas posing like some hoes up in a beauty pageant!
Nobody touching me, it's like I got the cooties rapping
Remember when we called niggas African booty scratchers?
Yeah that was random, but man so is life
You grab your needle, grab your thread, and hope you sew it right
I find myself fiending for a spot to go at night
With the liquor flowing steady and the hoes polite
The fast lane makes me reminisce on slower life
The unabomber, bitch I'm blowing up overnight (BOOM!)

[Outro]
Hey, yo, it's happening fast (Fast)
I say it's happening fast (Fast)
All the drama that I had to get past
Will it last? Or will it pass? (Pass)
Just as quick as it came (Came)
Hoes knowing my name (Name)
Dog, welcome to fame
I pray to God we don't change (Change)
But even if you don't
Most niggas look at you strange
But I guess I can't complain (Hey)
Hey man it's happening fast (Fast)
I say it's happening fast (Fast)
I say it's happening fast (Fast)

[Verse 1]
Look, here we go
The first time around
I left the cars at the house and I put the diamonds down
Them things come and they go its about the rhyming now
Im seeing it clearer the season is nearer
And still I must change
Im like a broken bill
Conservative for the most but I'm outspoken still
They not sure of the work but they all hoping he'll
Emerge to victor my words are pictures
And guess the colours so loud that you heard my scripture
With 4 walls give me the right brush and I draw all
I promise I've been thinking before y'all
I barely get tired I'm rarely inspired
And you accomplish in a week what I'm daily required
I meet quotas while you rappers having sleep-overs
Spending nights in the studio trying to beat Hova
Be in the throne instead of being your own
But Look

[Verse 2]
I'm making moves in my city so
My ex girls wanna be up in the video
They ex girls is steady tryin to get with me though
Important and vital I'm caught in a cycle
This is all I know
And yes I know it well
I try to explain it, my effort comes to no avail
I'm from the place where they release records and no one sells
And still they claim king nigga its the same thing
All day long
But thats a screw face
Rappers befriend you at first but really they two faced
Hoping they slip and trip over your own shoelace
Thats why I tuck em in not giving a fuck again
D.R.A. you add a K.E
A couple mill and you labels cannot play me
I never go broke I'm far from a flash in the pan
I am a passionate man, plan it with cash in my hand
Uh

[Verse 3]
I got few days left
But I'mma make use of every single one until every singles done
Until every record is sold, and every string is strung
Tell me take a breather Drake and everything will come
Dog its always been the same
Its all love like no score in a tennis game
For the son of Dennis James
Owner of the city downtown on a Friday
Streets behind me like I took a picture in the driveway
I roll down strips and hose down whips
That when turtle wax up they would close down Richmond
With no down shifting
Haters would say I'm adequate
Think I got the type of flow that would make an addict quit
21 years I've been pimping since being
Repurchased trap music 4 times since then
Seamless transition I'm the new fresh prince
Getting pennies for my thoughts
So I put my two cents in
Top of the morning I am dropping the coin in
Plus I'm changing the game
You hear me swapping the joint in
They put the fires out and bring the buyers out
And try and box us all together before they buy us out
If they profit from the events we handing flyers out
Then we profit from the attempts to hand desires out
But rich is how we all ending up
I'm at the label in the elevator send them up

[Verse 1]
When a good thing goes bad, it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change

[Chorus]
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
'Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say, "I love you too"

[Refrain]
But I need someone different
You know it, oh, you know it
Oh, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh, you know it
Oh, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh, she knows it
Oh, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
We live in a generation of not being in love and not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
'Cause we're scared to see each other with somebody else

[Chorus]
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
'Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say, "I love you too"

[Refrain]
But I need someone different
You know it, oh, you know it
Oh, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh, you know it
Oh, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh, she knows it
Oh, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
Oh, oh

[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Wakey wakey
Rise and shine
It's on again, off again, on again
Watch me fall
Like dominoes
In pretty patterns
Fingers in
The blackbird pie
I'm tingling tingling tingling
It's what you feel now
What you ought to what you ought to
Reasonable and sensible

[Chorus 1]
Dead from the neck up
I guess I'm stuffed, stuffed, stuffed
We thought you had it in you
But no, no, no
For no real reason

[Verse 2]
Squeeze the tubes and empty bottles
And take a bow take a bow take a bow
It's what you feel now
What you ought to what you ought to
An elephant that's in the room is
Tumbling, tumbling, tumbling
In duplicate and triplicate and
Plastic bags and
Duplicate and triplicate

[Chorus 2]
Dead from the neck up
I guess I'm stuck, stuck, stuck
We thought you had it in you
But no, no, no
Exactly where do you get off
Is enough, is enough?
I love you but enough is enough, enough of that stuff
There's no real reason

[Outro]
You've got a head full of feathers
You got melted to butter

[Verse 1]
Reckoner
Can't take it with you
Dancing for your pleasure

[Verse 2]
You are not to blame for
Bittersweet distractors
Dare not speak its name

[Refrain]
Dedicated to all hu–
All human beings

[Bridge]
Because we separate
Like ripples on a blank shore
Because we separate (In rainbows)
Like ripples on a blank shore (In rainbows)

[Verse 3]
Reckoner
Take me with you

[Refrain]
Dedicated to all hu–
All human beings

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
I don't know if I ever told you this before, before
But you're the only one I ever waited for this long
And now the room is crowded, right now
So tell me are you about it, right now?

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
I've been thinking of you all the time
There's been various issues, but would you let me, let me tonight?

[Verse 2: Kyle Christopher]
Got all them couples floating on your pink champagne
You know there's bottle service, bottle service, babe
Long as the DJ's playing all these raunchy songs
Girl, we can do this on the dancefloor all night long
Now I know the room is crowded, right now
But tell me are you about it right now?

[Hook: Frank Ocean]
I've been thinking of you all the time
There's various issues, but would you let me, let me tonight?
See, I've been dreaming of you in the daytime
And it ain't right, so would you let me, let me tonight?
Now listen, don't you get this twisted girl
If I leave you, without you, I miss you girl
And if I had you right now, I wouldn't change a thing
You tell me this ain't what you're used to
But baby can't no man judge you
I can tell ain't no man loving you
I can tell ain't no man loving you

[Intro]
I hear you talking mad shit (Wayne)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Hi, I'm Tunechi, I'm triple exclusive
I beat the pussy up, abusive

I'm cooler than Doritos in the blue bag
Oh that's your old man?
Girl you need a new man

And if you ever wanna leave

Girl your man ain't shit, so fuck that nigga
Just put on your poker face
And straight flush that shit

[Hook: Cherlise]
And I ain't hating but I know she don't love you right
She don't kiss you right, she don't touch you right
And I could give you everything that you want tonight
If you want tonight, I put you on tonight

And I ain't hating but I know she don't love you right
She don't kiss you right, she don't touch you right
And I could give you everything that you want tonight
If you want tonight, I put you on tonight
Yeahhh

[Verse 2: Cherlise]
You can keep your credit cards, but don't buy out the bar
'Cuz I'm just trying to see what's in your hair, yeah

Close to home

[Intro: T-Pain]
Yo!
Young Fyre
Over the guts
Let's go in brah
Yo

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Suicide doors, naw that was last year
Got suicide hoes butt-naked under my cashmere
Drinking full throttle, pulling half a gear
Two-wheel drive on these niggas, Cavalier
Wait till I crank it up, wait till I spazz hard
Then ain't nobody gonn' accept you like a MasterCard
Now ain't that bizarre, you say you from the hood
But nobody believe you so you try to pull the bastard card
Naw that shit don't work in this society
The game got potential but it's lacking the variety
Fans getting bored they don't even wanna buy CD's
Nigglas ain't selling so they blaming it on piracy
Argh! I'm too hard for the club seats
UFC submission hole I get em off me
The niggas in Tallahassee saying I'm off Glee
But the hoes say I'm sick, cough sneeze

[Interlude: Birdman]
Yeah, Birdman, you already know
You understand me?
YMCMB all day everyday
All we do is get money like we do it
Grind hard hustle 24 hours ain't no sleep when we do this shit
Ain't no care about sleeping
Ain't no clubbing cause we bring that to the studio
Ya understand me?
Just manifesting this game, getting more money than niggas ever been

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Pennies for my thoughts, dollars for my words
Hundred for the hook, one fifty for the verse
Cause bitch I got kids and they want Louis Vutton shit
And the Gucci wallet to carry crayons in
So discounts is a thing of the past
So is CEOs tryna put a thing on my ass
These record labels mad cause they know they can't get me
Cause I don't do threesomes, you can't fuck with me
Nappy Boy ooh wee that's the trademark
And this year I just plan on pulling my face card
Niggas concentrating on keeping they face hard
But I'm a fuck around and take away they face guard
Until then I'm a keep delivering hits out
And keep on playing stupid till niggas figure my shit out
I can't speak on the bus but when the word finally get out
I'll fill a swimming pool with the soda niggas a spit out

[Interlude: Birdman]
Ya understand me, lots full of whips
Bottles and bitches
Ya understand me pocket full of money
Ya understand me G4's and hoes nigga this how we living
Out on the grind all day every muthafuckin' day
We hang out the helicopter doin' fly-by's niggas
Ya understand me over the pacific
Ya understand me big money see we don't stop
Pain let's get it baby
YMCMB all muthafuckin' day

[Verse 3: T-Pain]
Last but not least I'm too cold to have hot rhymes
Jamaican bitches in my room doing the hot wine
Winning at all cost
Even if my niggas hit your Beanie Man with this Lady Sawed off
Ha ha, feel the rhythm of the beat bitch
Nappy Boy, the new Miami Heat bitch
Young Frizzle, he done turned on the heat switch
Walk up out of the mansion right up on to the beach, beeatch
Ye ain't never seen another Pain
32 cars you niggas stay in the other lane
Steve Jobs on these broke niggas
Take a good hard look at the motherfucking boat, nigga!
Shit, the rap game being burglarized
Check my certificate you can see that I'm certified
So they won't see it coming when the track hit em
And then I dipped twice-baptism

[Outro: Birdman]
Nigga that's what's happening
Moula crazy
Yeah, blow, blow!
Shining in this bitch, I got them bitches on my swizzag
Swagger on Bruce Lee - kung fu - kickass
Come through in a coupe, make that money hoola-hoop
Triple OG kush, eyes low as Lucy Liu
Got them hoes going crazy like now they goin West
Got that chopper in the car, stashed by the arm rest
Put the light on me, It look right on me
And tell them bitches they can get one night only
Tunechi be my name.. but you already know that
I already hit it: girl, that pussy throwback
Weezy fucked the world: now how's that for romance?
Weezy go Rocky, Rambo, Conan
Diamond in the rough: light this muthafucka up
Life in the fast lane: bitch, buckle up
On "my life, my life, my life, my life" shit
YMCMB, get the spotlight quick

[Intro]
Damn, has it been that long? (haha)
Say what happens since I been gone
They got the game all wrong, it's too pretty in here
Let's say we take it back to the trap one time

[Hook]
I went from rolling wit' dem rocks on the block
To controlling my position at the top
Of every chart and I will not, stop
(We ride, and we roll, and you stop) Yeah we go, yeah we go
(hey, hey, hey)
Yea you know, yea you know, yea you know, yea you know
Yea you know, yea you know
Girl we ride, man we roll, and you stop
And we go, and we go

[Verse 1]
In the middle of a fight, I'm so cool
Everybody wonder how I go through
All of this half of which would have broke you
Came out smelling like a rose even more true
Worldwide, bi-coastal, global, nigga's I respect
Cause they more more closer
Cause I get it don't mean they do too
Cause I ain't got a damn minute ain't no 'tude
You know we never not goin all in
Kickin doors over just to let my dogs in
So many rides never catch a nigga walkin'
In a G-5 tryna fit a bunch of broads in
Then we landin' laughin'. chicks with fantastic asses
Extravagant habitats, if you never seen tragic happen (hey)
Make magic happen with cash I'm actually catchin magic
In the market for lavish mansions 'n NBA expansions
I was passin out Phantoms in 04 so no, dough ain't shit to me
Way past respect you see, but a nigga ain't even half as big as he finna be

[Hook]
I went from rolling wit' dem rocks on the block
To controlling my position at the top
Of every chart I will not, stop
(We ride, and we roll, man you stop) Yeah we go, yeah we go
(hey, hey, hey)
(yea you know, yea you know, yea you know, yea you know
Yea you know, yea you know)
Girl we ride, man we roll, and you stop
And we go, and we go (go)

[Verse 2]
So fly why would I wanna land for
Everything you could ask for and more
Your choice, you could even be a fan or
Hate to see a nigga get a hundred grand more
Bein' a motherfuckin' man, won't stand for
The rap wars, always goin' back and forth
Nip it in the bud kill it like cancer
But when it rains, then it pours give a damn sure
In France, bonjour, merci, oui
The same people on tour, on TV
They signed him shoulda kept your reciept
Get a refund cause you sure can't see me
Who keeps CD's on repeat, stuck in MP3's for 3 weeks
At the gates on the day I was released
The only time you will ever see me free

[Bridge]
Big money J, much as you can get for it?
Atlantic records say just make another hit for me
I tell 'em cut a hundred million dollar check for me
Like it or not, don't lose no respect for me
Never mind what I did, cause the best commin'
I'm the king in a game like chess to me
So put the cash in tha bag
Give the rest to the attendant puttin' gas in the jet for a homie friend

[Hook]
I went from rolling wit' dem rocks on the block
To controlling my position at the top
Of every chart I will not, stop
(We ride, and we roll, man you stop) Yeah we go, yeah we go
(hey, hey, hey)
(yea you know, yea you know, yea you know, yea you know
Yea you know, yea you know)
Girl we ride, man we roll, and you stop
And we go, and we go (go)

[Verse 3]
I got a new swag and it's a new day
Here we go again too, what it do 'J?
If you recall, I was the one who used to move yay
Now I gotta new Audemar with a blue face
Hoppin' up in G4 jet, no suitcase, whole new wardrobe in a new place
Change clothes if a stain on my shoelace
T.I. roll like sushi, touché
If the king ain't back, who the hell am I?
Bringin' homocide to the gang, no alibi
Can't tell a lie to the judge, I'm guilty
Your Honor do you mind the guy tried to kill me
I could still be, in a trap now
AK 'round, little yay 'round
100k downstairs by the trey pound
But if they wonderin who runnin the A now?

[Hook]
(Yea you know, yea you know, yea you know, yea you know
Yea you know, yea you know)
Girl we ride, man we roll, and you stop
And we go, and we go (go)

Yeah you know that we ride
In control we don't stop
We gon blow where we drop
Let you know we on top
Girl we ride, man we roll, then you stop
And we go, and we go
Say we roll and we ride
In control we don't stop
We gon' blow where we drop
Let you know we on top
Girl we ride, man we roll, then you stop
And we go, and we go

[Outro - T.I. - talking]
Prison ain't change me, it made me worse, right Pop?
If I want it, I'm a come get it
I ain't askin for it, I'm a take it
We takers!

(Timbaland x3)
Hit the dance floor and pick it up
Baby, put it down and pick it up

[Verse 1 - Pitbull]
We used listen to cover girls (wasn't in it)
And now I mess with cover girls
Magazines, you can catch me on the cover, girl
I created my own planet
I hover the Earth, and cover the world
I spit so thick, imma call it a pearl
I see you tryna claim her, now I play with her pearls
Try to come at me, with all of my 

[?]
Life's a bitch, but I made her my girl
Now she does what I say, does what I please
? she lives on her knees
Jack and Jill went up the hill
Each with a buck and a quarter
Jill came back with $2.50
What a working girl, now work it, girl! Like..

[Pre-Hook: Pitbull]
Ah, Ah, Ah-Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah (Ah, Ah)
Ah, Ah, Ah-Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah (Ah, Ah)

[Hook: Timbaland]
Hey Girl! I love when you do
With all that booty, oh-oh my god
Hey Girl! I love when you do
With all that booty, oh-oh my god
Oh-oh my god, Oh-oh my god
Oh-oh my god, I love that booty

[Bridge: Timbaland]
I love when you, making me
Oh pass at me, oh pass at me
I love when you, making me
Oh pass at me, oh pass at me

[Verse 2: Timbaland & Pitbull]
(Timbaland)
I love when I see your pretty ass on the floor
I love when I see you break it down like you in control
(Pitbull)
I got a cup to my right, and a girl to my left
And I'm stumbling when I'm out of breath
Like g-g-g-g-g-g-go
Like g-g-g-g-g-g-go
I got girls on my right, I got girls on my left
The one in the middle and I'm feeling on her breath
Like g-g-g-g-g-g-go
Like g-g-g-g-g-g-go

[Hook]

[Bridge: Timbaland]
I love when you, making me
Oh pass at me, oh pass at me
I love when you, making me
Oh pass at me, oh pass at me
I love when you, making me
Oh pass at me, oh pass at me
I love when you, making me
Oh pass at me, oh pass at me
I love-love-love-love-love-love
Love-love-love-love-love-love
Love-love-love-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e

(Beat breaks)

Pass at me, pass at me, pass at me
Pass at me, pass at me, pass at me
Pass at me, pass at me!
Pass at me, pass at me, pass at me
Pass at me, pass at, pass at me!

[Hook]

[Refrain]
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, oh-oh
Ahh

[Verse 1]
I can't believe what you said to me
Last night we were alone
You threw your hands up
Baby, you gave up
You gave up
I can't believe how you looked at me
With your James Dean glossy eyes
In your tight jeans
With your long hair and your cigarette stained lies

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Could we fix you if you broke?
And is your punch line just a joke?

[Chorus]
I'll never talk again
Oh, boy, you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless
And I'll never love again
Oh, boy, you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless

[Verse 2]
I can't believe how you slurred at me
With your half wired broken jaw
You popped my heart seams
On my bubble dreams
Bubble dreams
I can't believe how you looked at me
With your Johnnie Walker eyes
He's gonna get you and after he's through
There's gonna be no love left to rye

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I know that it's so complicated
But I'm a loser in love, so baby
Raise a glass to mend all the broken hearts of all my wrecked up friends

[Chorus]
I'll never talk again
Oh, boy, you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless so speechless
I'll never love again
Oh, friend, you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless

[Refrain]
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, oh-oh
Ahh

[Bridge]
And after all the drinks and bars that we've been to
Would you give it all up? Could I give it all up for you?
And after all the boys and the girls that we've been through
Would you give it all up?
Could you give it all up, if I promise, boy, to you?
That I'll never talk again
And I'll never love again
I'll never write a song
Won't even sing along
I'll never love again (Ahh)

[Chorus 2]
So speechless (Ahh)
You left me speechless, so speechless
Will you ever talk again?
Oh, boy, why you so speechless? (Speechless, baby)
You've left me speechless, so speechless

[Outro]
Some men may follow me
But you choose "death and company"
Why you so speechless?
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1: 2-D]
Up on Melancholy Hill, there's a plastic tree
Are you here with me?
Just looking out on the day of another dream
Where you can't get what you want, but you can get me
So let's set out to sea, love
'Cause you are my medicine when you're close to me
When you're close to me

[Verse 2: 2-D]
So call in the submarines, 'round the world we'll go
Does anybody know, love
If we're looking out on the day of another dream?
If you can't get what you want, then you come with me
Up on Melancholy Hill
Sits the manatee, love
Just looking out for the day when you're close to me
When you're close to me
When you're close to me

[Verse 1]
A devastating backstroke
All the way from France
With shiny, shiny cufflinks
A shirtsleeve to enhance

[Chorus 1]
The pin-striped men of morning
Are coming forward to dance
With pure Egyptian Cotton
The kids don't stand a chance

[Verse 2]
You criticize the practice
By murdering their plants
Ignoring all the history
Denying them romance

[Chorus 2]
The pin-striped men of morning
Are coming forward to dance
Forty-million dollars
The kids don't stand a chance

[Verse 3]
I didn't like the business
But that was at first glance
Your pillow feels so soft now
But still you must advance

[Chorus 3]
The pin-striped men of morning
The partners in the dance
The paper's shot to pieces
The kids don't stand a chance

[Intro]
The love glows, I know the love glows
Oh I know the love glows, I know the love glows
Yeah

[Verse 1]
If we colored our white walls pitch black
Turn all the lights off and lay back
We can make love with our bare hands
We can make light out of thin air
Or we can close our eyes and sleep well
Dreams feel realer than right now
But whatever you do don’t let go
My only nightmare is waking up alone
In a world where you’re not mine
And the room painted off white
Running out in the daylight, tryna get back to you
When I stare into your eyes, I see my real life
That’s why I never sleep with my back to you

[Chorus]
When I lay down, facing you
I can feel my eyelids glow (I never sleep with my back to you)
And if the sun rises, (back to you) behind you
I don’t think I’d notice though
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you, back to you

[Verse 2]
Laying under the covers that I stole
From your side of the bed cause I got cold
You rolled over and whispered ro-robbery
So you been sleeping with a thief in your bed
Stole your heart and your pillows
Whatever you do just don’t go
Baby, the worst jail is
Waking up alone in a world where you’re not mine
In a room painted off white
Running out in the daylight, tryna get back to you
When I’m looking in you eyes, I see my real life
So I never sleep with my back to you

[Chorus]
When I lay down, facing you
I can feel my eyelids glow (I never sleep with my back to you)
And if the sun rises, (back to you) behind you
I don’t think I’d notice though
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you, back to you

[Bridge]
Like a nightlight
Like a teddy bear
Like a toddler’s blanket
Look at us baby, two grownups acting like children
Ooooooo, yeah

[Chorus]
When I lay down, facing you
I can feel my eyelids glow (I never sleep with my back to you)
And if the sun rises, (back to you) behind you
I don’t think I’d notice though
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you, back to you
When I lay down, facing you
I can feel my eyelids glow (I never sleep with my back to you)
And if the sun rises, (back to you) behind you
I don’t think I’d notice though
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you, back to you

If you a fake nigga, I might have to explain it to you but I ain't got time to do that
Ya dug? I'm getting to the money, yeah
412, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, it's the Prince

[Verse 1]
You've been checking on my facts
And I admit I have been lax
In double-screening what I say
It wasn't funny anyway

[Chorus]
I stand
Corrected
I stand
Corrected

[Verse 2]
No one cares when you are wrong
But I've been at this far too long
To act like that when we should be
In perfect harmony

[Chorus]
I stand
Corrected
I, oh, I stand
Corrected

[Bridge]
Lord knows I haven't tried, I'll take my stand
One last time
Forget the protocol, I'll take your hand
Right in mine

[Chorus]
I stand
Corrected
I, oh, I stand
Corrected

[Verse 1]
I saw you down at the station
Your leather suitcase burst at the seams
Stay all day up in your rooms now
That's not a problem you've ever seen

[Chorus]
Fall on your knees, wasting your arrows
You'd found you've walked along these halls

[Verse 2]
I awoke up in a bedroom
You'd gone out hunting, I was asleep
Spend my day out at the fountain
That's not a problem you had foreseen

[Chorus]
Fall on your knees, wasting your arrows
You'd found you've walked along these halls
Fall on your knees, wasting your arrows
You'd found you've walked along these halls

[Outro]
Oh, it's no use at all
But that life in the church could still remain

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna be your friend
I just wanna be your lover
No matter how it ends
No matter how it starts

[Chorus]
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
And fall off the table
Get swept under
Denial, denial

[Verse 2]
The infrastructure will collapse
From voltage spikes
Throw your keys in the bowl
Kiss your husband 'good night'

[Chorus]
And forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Fall off the table
Get swept under
Denial, denial
Denial, denial

[Outro]
(Your ears should be burning)
Denial, denial
(Your ears should be burning)
Denial, denial

[Verse 1]
I wake up, my shoulders cold
I've got to leave here, before I go
I pull my shirt on, walk out the door
Drag my feet along the floor
I pull my shirt on, walk out the door
Drag my feet along the floor

[Pre-Chorus]
Then I see you, you're walking 'cross the campus
Cruel professor, studying romances

[Chorus]
How am I supposed to pretend
I never want to see you again?
How am I supposed to pretend
I never want to see you again?

[Verse 2]
Walk to class in front of ya
Spilled kefir on your keffiyah
You look inside and turn to the door
Drag your feet along the floor

[Pre-Chorus]
Then I see you, you're walking 'cross the campus
Cruel professor, studying romances

[Chorus]
How am I supposed to pretend
I never want to see you again?
How am I supposed to pretend
I never want to see you again?

[Bridge]
In the afternoon, you're out on the stone and grass
And I'm sleeping on the balcony after class
In the afternoon, you're out on the stone and grass
And I'm sleeping on the balcony after class

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
In the afternoon, you're out on the stone and grass
And I'm sleeping on the balcony after class
In the afternoon, you're out on the stone and grass
And I'm sleeping on the balcony after class

Clams Casino, A$AP (Wassup)
See me in the hood, the gangstas saying, "Wassup" (Wassup, hey)
See me in the hood, the gangstas saying, "Wassup" (Wassup, hey)

[Verse 1]
Back once again, sipping Henn', mixed with juice and gin
Bitches in, couple lady friends countin' Benjamins
Spinners spin on them twenty twins, that Mercedes Benz
Dividends made a change of plans, well that all depends
Shout-out my parolees and I smoke that OG
Kush motherfuck' the police, all my niggas rock gold teeth
So hood and we so street, sippin' on that codeine
We hustle hard, no sleep, your bitch loose, that's no leash
I ain't talking 'bout no money, I ain't talking 'bout no cars
Talking 'bout no diamonds 'cause that shit is a façade
Times is really hard, I fucked a couple broads
Smoked some purple out the jars, let me tell you who we are

[Pre-Chorus]
I be that pretty motherfucker, Harlem's what I'm reppin'
Tell 'em quit the bitchin', we gon' make it in a second
Pretty motherfucker, Harlem's what I'm reppin'
Tell 'em quit the bitchin', we gon' make it in a second

[Chorus]
See me in the hood, the gangstas saying, "Wassup" (Wassup)
See me in the hood, the gangstas saying, "Wassup" (Wassup)
See me in the hood, the gangstas saying, "Wassup" (Wassup)
See me in the hood (Uh), the gangstas saying, "Wassup" (Wassup)

[Verse 2]
Pretty nigga in some shit you never hear of
Only thing bigger than my ego is my mirror (Uh)
Clothes getting weirder
Money get longer, pretty nigga pin your hair up (Uh)
The nerve of this dude
But I'm cool as a vent, 40 ounce full of brew

[Pre-Chorus]
I be that pretty motherfucker, Harlem's what I'm reppin'
Tell 'em quit the bitchin', we gon' make it in a second
Pretty motherfucker, Harlem's what I'm reppin'
Tell 'em quit the bitchin', we gon' make it in a second
I be that pretty motherfucker, Harlem's what I'm reppin'
Tell 'em quit the bitchin', we gon' make it in a second
Pretty motherfucker, Harlem's what I'm reppin'

[Verse 1]
Who gives a fuck about an Oxford comma?
I've seen those English dramas too; they're cruel
So if there's any other way to spell the word
It's fine with me, with me

[Chorus 1]
Why would you speak to me that way?
Especially when I always said that I
Haven't got the words for you
All your diction dripping with disdain
Through the pain, I always tell the truth

[Verse 2]
Who gives a fuck about an Oxford comma?
I climbed to Dharamsala too, I did
I met the highest Lama
His accent sounded fine to me, to me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Take your handbook, it's no trick
Take the chapstick, put it on your lips
Crack a smile, adjust my tie
Know your boyfriend, unlike other guys

[Chorus 2]
Why would you lie 'bout how much coal you have?
Why would you lie about something dumb like that?
Why would you lie 'bout anything at all?
First the window, then it's to the wall
Lil Jon, he always tells the truth

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Check your passport, it's no trick
Take the chapstick, put it on your lips
Crack a smile, adjust my tie
Know your butler, unlike other guys

[Chorus 3]
Why would you lie 'bout how much coal you have?
Why would you lie about something dumb like that?
Why would you lie 'bout anything at all?
First the window, then it's to the wall
Why would you tape my conversations?
Show your paintings at the United Nations
Lil Jon, he always tells the truth

[Chorus]
Your sword's grown old and rusty
Burnt beneath the rising sun
It's locked up like a trophy
Forgetting all the things it's done
And though it's been a long time
You're right back where you started from
I see it in your eyes
That now you're giving up the gun

[Verse 1]
When I was seventeen, I had wrists like steel
And I felt complete
And now my body fades behind a brass charade
And I'm obsolete
But if the chance remained to see those better days
I'd cut the cannons down
My ears are blown to bits from all the rifle hits
But still I crave that sound

[Chorus]
Your sword's grown old and rusty
Burnt beneath the rising sun
It's locked up like a trophy
Forgetting all the things it's done
And though it's been a long time
You're right back where you started from
I see it in your eyes
That now you're giving up the gun

[Verse 2]
I heard you play guitar down at a seedy bar
Where skinheads used to fight
Your Tokugawa smile and your garbage style
Used to save the night
You felt the coming wave, told me we'd all be brave
You said you wouldn't flinch
But in the years that passed, since I saw you last
You haven't moved an inch

[Chorus]
Your sword's grown old and rusty
Burnt beneath the rising sun
It's locked up like a trophy
Forgetting all the things it's done
And though it's been a long time
You're right back where you started from
I see it in your eyes
That now you're giving up the gun

[Bridge]
I see you shine in your way
Go on, go on, go on
I see you shine in your way
Go on, go on, go on
I see you shine in your way
Go on, go on, go on
I see you shine in your way
Go on, go on, go on
I see you shine in your way
Go on, go on, go on
I see you shine in your way
Go on, go on, go on
(I see you shine in your way
Go on, go on, go on
I see you shine in your way
Go on, go on, go on)

[Chorus]
Your sword's grown old and rusty
Burnt beneath the rising sun
It's locked up like a trophy
Forgetting all the things it's done
And though it's been a long time
You're right back where you started from
I see it in your eyes
That now you're giving up the gun

Ayy ayy oh ah, ayy ayy oh ah, ayy ayy oh ah, ayy ayy ayy
Ayy ayy oh ah, ayy ayy oh ah, ayy ayy oh ah, ayy ayy ayy

[Verse 1]
You found a sweater on the ocean floor
They're gonna find it if you didn't close the door
You and the smart ones sit outside of their sight
In a house on a street they wouldn't park on at night
Dad was a risk-taker, his was a shoe maker
You, "Greatest Hits 2006" little list-maker
Heard codes in the melodies, you heeded the call
Oh, you were born with ten fingers and you're gonna use them all

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Interesting colors I discovered myself
If your art life is gritty, you'll be toasting my health
If an interest in culture should be lining the walls
When your birthright is interest, you could just accrue it all

[Chorus]
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
It's a line that's always running
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
I can feel it coming

[Solo Guitar]

[Bridge]
You could turn your back on the bitter world
You could turn your back on the bitter world
You could turn your back on the bitter world
You could turn your back on the bitter world

[Chorus]
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
It's a line that's always running
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
I can feel it coming
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
It's a line that's always running
Me and my cousins and you and your cousins
I can feel it coming

[Guitar Solo]

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
As a young girl
Louis Vuitton
With your mother
On a sandy lawn
As a sophomore
With reggaeton
And the linens
You're sittin' on

[Chorus]
Is your bed made? Is your sweater on?
Do you want to fuck like you know I do?
Like you know I do, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Post-Chorus]
But this feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel too
But it feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel

[Verse 2]
Can you stay up
To see the dawn?
In the colors
Of Benetton

[Chorus]
Is your bed made? Is your sweater on?
Do you want to, like you know I do?
Like you know I do, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Post-Chorus]
Feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel too
But this feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
Is your bed made? Is your sweater on?
Do you wanna, like you know I do?
Like you know I do, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Johanna drove slowly into the city
The Hudson River all filled with snow
She spied the ring on His Honor's finger
Oh, oh, oh
A thousand years in one piece of silver
She took it from his lily-white hand
Showed no fear, she'd seen the thing
In the young men's wing at Sloan-Kettering

[Chorus]
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"
'Ey, 'ey, 'ey, 'ey!
'Ey, 'ey, 'ey!

[Verse 2]
His Honor drove southward, seeking exotica
Down to the pueblo huts of New Mexico
Cut his teeth on turquoise harmonicas
Oh, oh, oh
I saw Johanna down in the subway
She took an apartment in Washington Heights
Half of the ring lies here with me
But the other half's at the bottom of the sea

[Chorus]
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"

[Outro]
'Ey, 'ey, 'ey, 'ey!
'Ey, 'ey, 'ey, 'ey!

[Verse 1]
Chestnut vibes on a Saturday night
Mystical boys feelin' alright
Raggedy wisdom falls from my hands
The ladies of Cambridge know who I am

[Chorus]
I've had dreams of Boston all of my life
Chinatown between the sound of the night
But if you leave I just don't think I could take it
Take it, take it, take it

[Verse 2]
Graveyard bricks will fall into style
Lady as Pharaoh, Charles as the Nile
That's a museum, price you could pay
Stones of your fathers stand there today

[Chorus]
I've had dreams of Boston all of my life
Chinatown between the sound of the night
But if you leave I just don't think I could take it
Take it, take it, take it

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I've had dreams of Boston all of my life
Chinatown between the sound of the night

[Bridge]
'Cause when you left my room to go to the kitchen
I imagined that you were dead
A morbid streak runs through the whole of my family
But for you, I could put it to rest

[Outro]
But if you leave I just don't think I could take it
Take it, take it, take

[Chorus]
Oh, California, oh, California, oh, California, oh
Oh, California, oh, California, oh, California, oh

[Verse 1]
This girl wrote drug raps in baggy sweaters
Tight neon tights, T-shirts and big letters
Back at her house was an Irish setter
With a heart-shaped tag hanging off its collar
Through half the towns of Arizona
I dream the dreams I have when I hold her
Near Palm Springs, we were struck by boulders
'Cause they looked like skull and bones

[Chorus]
Oh, California, oh, California, oh, California, oh
Oh, California, oh, California, oh, California, oh

[Verse 2]
Questions I had as I went through this:
Are our parents actually Buddhist?
Is the pool below me the bluest?
Is the TV on?
Through half the Taquerias y Fondas
Half the health clubs, half of the saunas
Half the Barbaras, half of the Rhondas
Is there something there?

[Chorus]
Oh, California, oh, California, oh, California, oh
Oh, California, oh, California, oh, California, oh
Oh, California, oh, California, oh, California, oh
Oh, California, oh, California, oh, California, oh

[Verse 3]
This girl was smarter than television scripts
This girl wasn't damaged, her jeans were just ripped
This girl was the girl that the girls in your world thought about
When the night was cold
How many towns have claimed that they know you?
How many nations think that they own you?
How many simple minds think the same sun
Don't shine on their sunglasses now?

[Chorus]
Oh, California, oh, California, oh, California, oh
Oh, California, oh, California, oh, California, oh
Oh, California, oh, California, oh, California, oh

[Verse 1]
An ancient business, a modern piece of glasswork
Down on the corner that you walk each day in passing
The elderly sales clerk won't eye us with suspicion
The whole, immortal corporation's given its permission

[Verse 2]
A little stairway, a little piece of carpet
A pair of mirrors that are facing one another
Out in both directions, a thousand little Julias
That come together in the middle of Manhattan

[Pre-Chorus]
You waited since lunch
It all comes at once

[Chorus]
Ah-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 3]
Around the corner, the house that modern art built
A house for modern art to keep it out the closets
The people who might own it, the sins of pride and envy
And on the second floor, the Richard Serra Skate Park

[Pre-Chorus]
You waited since lunch
It all comes at once

[Chorus]
Ah-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 4]
Sit on the park wall, ask all the right questions
"Why are the horses racing taxis in the winter?"
Look up at the buildings, imagine who might live there
Imagining your wolfords in a ball upon the sink there

[Pre-Chorus]
You waited since lunch
It all comes at once

[Chorus]
Ah-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
I see a mansard roof through the trees
I see a salty message written in the eaves
The ground beneath my feet, the hot garbage and concrete
And now the tops of buildings, I can see them too
I see a mansard roof through the trees
I see a salty message written in the eaves
The ground beneath my feet, the hot garbage and concrete
And now the tops of buildings, I can see them too

[Verse 2]
The Argentines collapse in defeat
The admiralty surveys the remnants of the fleet
The ground beneath their feet is a nautically mapped sheet
As thin as paper while it slips away from view

[Verse 1]
It's gonna take a little time while you're waiting like a factory line
I'll ride across the park, backseat on the 79
Wasted days, you've come to pass

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So go, I know you would not stay
It wasn't true, but anyway
Pollination yellow cab

[Chorus]
Ohh, ohh

[Verse 2]
You walk up the stairs, see the French kids by the door
Up one more flight, see the Buddha on the second floor
Coronation rickshaw grab

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So go, I know you would not stay
It wasn't true, but anyway
Racist dreams you should not have

[Chorus]
Ohh, ohh

[Bridge]
No excuse to be so callous
Dress yourself in bleeding madras
Charm your way across the Khyber Pass
Stay awake to break the habit
Sing in praise of Jackson Crowter
Watch your step along the arch of

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
No excuse to be so callous
Dress yourself in bleeding madras
Charm your way across the Khyber Pass
Stay awake to break the habit
Sing in praise of Jackson Crowter
Watch your step along the arch of glass

[Verse 1]
Unsentimental, traveling around
Sure of myself, sure of it now
But you were standing there so close to me
Like the future was supposed to be
In the aisles of the grocery
And the blocks uptown
I remember, remember it well
But if I'd forgotten, could you tell?
In the shadow of your first attack
I was questioning and looking back
You said, "Baby, we don't speak of that"
Like a real aristocrat

[Verse 2]
Compound to compound, lazy and safe
Wanted to leave it, wanted to wait
When the taxi door was open wide
I pretended I was horrified
By the uniform and gloves outside
Of the courtyard gate
You're not a victim, but neither am I
Nostalgic for garbage, desperate for time
I could blame it on your mother's hair
Or the colors that your father wears
But I know that I was never fair
You were always fine

[Verse 3]
Unsentimental, traveling around
Sure of myself, sure of it now
You were standing there so close to me
Like the future was supposed to be
In the aisles of the grocery
And the blocks uptown
I remember, remember it well
And if I'd forgotten, could you tell?
In the shadow of your first attack
I was questioning and looking back
You were standing on another track
Like a real aristocrat

[Verse 1]
Occident out on the weekend
That's the way that we relax
English Breakfast tastes like Darjeeling
But she's too cute to even ask

[Chorus]
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)

[Post-Chorus 1]
Nastiness will cause your doom
Turn and walk back to your room

[Verse 2]
The precedent's already set now
You spend a week in Old San Juan
Spanish brownstone with chairs of leather
And Spanish waves to roll along

[Chorus]
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)

[Post-Chorus 2]
Majesty's not overheard
Cryptographs can't stand the word

[Ad lib]

[Chorus]
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, your collegiate grief has left you
Dowdy in sweatshirts, absolute horror

[Verse 1: Ezra Koenig]
It's not right, but it's now or never
And if I wait, could I ever forgive myself?
On a night when the moon glows yellow in the riptide
With the light from the TVs buzzing in the house

[Pre-Chorus: Ezra Koenig]
'Cause I'm gonna cut it where I can
And then I'm gonna duck out behind them
If I ever had a chance, it's now then
But I never had the feeling I could offer that to you
To offer it to you would be cruel
When all I want to do is use, use you

[Chorus: Ezra Koenig]
He was a diplomat's son, it was '81
He was a diplomat's son, it was '81
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2: Ezra Koenig]
Dressed in white with my car keys hidden in the kitchen
I could sleep wherever I lay my head
And the sight of your two shoes sitting in the bathtub
Let me know that I shouldn't give up just yet

[Pre-Chorus: Ezra Koenig]
'Cause I'm gonna take it from Simon
And then I'm gonna duck out behind them
If I ever had a chance, it's now then
But I never had the feeling I could offer that to you
To offer it to you would be cruel
When all I want to do is use, use you

[Chorus: Ezra Koenig]
He was a diplomat's son, it was '81
He was a diplomat's son, it was '81
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Bridge: Rostam Batmanglij]
I know, you'll say I'm not doing it right
But this is how I want it
I can't go back to how I felt before
There's–

[Verse 3: Ezra Koenig]
That night I smoked a joint with my best friend
We found ourselves in bed, when I woke up, he was gone

[Chorus: Ezra Koenig]
He was a diplomat's son, it was '81
He was a diplomat's son, it was '81

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro: Ezra Koenig]
Looking out at the ice cold water all around me
I can't feel any traces of that other place
In the dark, when the wind comes racing off the river
There's a car, all black with diplomatic plates

[Verse 1]
I had a feeling once
That you and I
Could tell each other everything
For two months
But even with our oath
With truth on our side
When you turn away from me
It's not right

[Chorus]
I think you're a contra
I think you're a contra
I think you're a contra
I think you're a contra

[Verse 2]
My revolution thoughts
Your little arrows of desire
I want to trace them to the source
And the wire
But it's not useful now
Since we've both made up our minds
You're going to watch out for yourself
And so will I

[Chorus]
I think you're a contra
And I think that you've lied
Don't call me a contra
'Til you've tried

[Bridge]
You wanted good schools and friends with pools
You're not a contra
You wanted rock and roll, complete control
Well, I don't know

[Verse 3]
Never pick sides
Never choose between two
Well, I just wanted you
I just wanted you
You said, "Never pick sides
Never choose between two"
Well, I just wanted you
I just wanted you

[Chorus]
I think you're a contra
And I think that you've lied
Don't call me a contra
'Til you've tried
Shoutsout to my nigga Jabar..

Its Soulja Boy I'm in this muthafucker live..
Let's get it!

Ocean Gang, drown bitch, I'm back like I never left
Haters talking down, tell them niggas gonna kill they self
Never gave a fuck, I don't do this shit often
Came out the water like a pretty-ass dolphin
Swag on my fin, 10 on my ring
I done stepped in the club, god damn I made it rain
Ball like Major Payne, 2 straps like Max Payne
Niggas talking about me, SOD on me
SOD on everything man, this my life
God damn I love this shit, I wouldn't trade it for shit
I done fucked 20 hoes, word around the globe
Made a bitch touch her toes
Made her took off all her clothes
Ocean Gang can drown, I be standing on the stage
With a 100 million dollars like "God damn I'm paid"
Lil Dre be this shit, nigga fuck what ya heard
Talking down on my clique, get flipped like a bird, bitch!

Screaming "Ocean Gang or drown!" I'm the Swag Daddy
Niggas mad cause I ride, and my paint candy
Niggas talking down, bitch, my swag outstanding!
Looking like I done came from another planet
Looking like I done swagged about another million
God damn, I'm some shit that you've never seen
I'm so fresh, look like I came out your dreams
Lil Dre bitch, I'm my brother's keeper
AK-47, switched it for the heat seeker
I'mma find you if you talking down
I'm the swag daddy bitch, that's word around town
Disrespect SOD, bitch it's going down
I'm not Yung Joc, bitches going down
Swag nonstop in my fucking town
Welcome to my city: let's go smoke 100 pounds

[Hook - Soulja Boy]

[Verse 3 - Soulja Boy]
All that I'm hearing is Soulja Boy is getting cake
I don't ever go to sleep, how the fuck I'm gonna wake & bake
They call me Lil Dre, condo by the fuckin lake
The fuck you niggas smokin? Mission by the fuckin ocean
Bitch tried to kick me off the plane
Cause my pants saggin
Went and caught the private jet cause I'm the swag daddy
Niggas mad cause my swag's so outstanding
Pull up to the red carpet, hopping out the Phantom
I gives a fuck what you think: I do what I want to
Ride through my trap, throwing money out the sunroof
If I said it on the track, then I fucking mean it
Pretty Boy Swag: I'm so damn conceited!
And I look like a fucking genius!
Standing on the tv screen: nigga suck my penis
No homo bitch, bitch I'm rich, and I fucking mean it
God damn I smoke that purp, and that shit is stinkin

[Hook - Soulja Boy]

[Verse 1 - Trey Songz]
I hit your city and I'm looking for some talent
I need a pretty young thing that could blow
I found it girl - your mouth is so astounding
Never got wet and then a nigga just drowneded
And bitch niggas be hating cause the bitches all around him
Worldwide girls eyes mesmerize, bezel shine
Future mind, present mine, roley it tell me present time
If you ever hear I'm big-headed, that's just my Heavy mind
I'm fly as fuck, you the back of the Delta line
I'm focused, poking the dopest Columbian coke, no joke
I'm so cold, it's confetti time since ready time
I got bars for life, Martin and Eddie time
Dinner alone so some Opus and spaghetti’s fine
Yeah that's red wine, headline
Say I'm engaged on the internet: they're lying
5 tours in 2 years: heard they paid a nigga straight
Plus I stay up in some pussy tryna say a nigga gay
But I learned tho: haters gon hate
But a hater never ate a scrape off of my plate
Blackhead ass niggas get your head up out my face
Keep my dick in your mouth so it's fuck what you say
Keep your bitch up in the house
She's sucking on Trey
She lied when she replied "you ain't got nothing on me"
But she tried her mouth was wide, I didn't want that on my sheets
I told her suck my scrotum, I go wild on these beats
Why these lousy motherfuckers keep stickin on me?
Drowsy motherfuckers keep sleeping on me..
They say I'm falling off - I guess we just gon' see
You niggas wack songs keep leaking on me

[Hook - Trey Songz]
It's Tre ho..
They know, they know, they know..

That the realest on the rise, fuck them other guys
Take whoever beat and eat it like a piece of pie
They know.. they know

[Verse 2 - Trey Songz]
This money-making my conversation
He talking blatant, he probably faking
I wake and bake, I ain’t steak & shake
But I take the cake to my paper date
It's super flow and it activates you stupid hoes
Just master hate. Different club, the same whores, I'm bored
I head to the gate. Now somewhere making that mattress break
You're somewhere faking, you masturbaing
I said I was gone, well I'm back now, he had to wait long
Can't believe a nigga still will say that Trey can't rap today: wrong
Cause I know a nigga still
Will kill on any nigga who's jacking they songs
What I learned tho: haters gon hate
But a hater never ate a scrape off of my plate
Boy I made it, plus I'm faded, I be stuntin all day
It's ok, just say it, you was fronting on Trey
It's a movie, it's a massacre, and I'm about to feel Leatherfaced
Leave you niggas stuck with the "I could be doing better"-face
I only said that cause I'm fucking with this movie shit
And really, truthfully, that ain't got shit to do with shit
But shit: why the got me like this?
Record labels tryna make a carbon copy like this
They heard I was staying out of lobbies like this
They saying "Trigga bodied this bitch" but that's something
Trey know.. Trey know..
It's Trey ho.. they know, they know, they know..
Haters gon hate
But a hater never ate a scrape off of my plate
Backhand ass niggas get the fuck out my face
Keep my dick up in your mouth, so it's fuck what you say

[Verse]
Darker times
They're telling boulder heavy lies
Looks like all we've got is each other
The truth is obsolete
Remember when all I had was my mother
She didn't compromise
She could recognize, voodoo
Our daughters and our sons
Are just candles in the sun, voodoo
Don't let him see divide, hm
Don't you let her see divide, voodoo

[Hook]
She's got the whole wide world in her juicy fruit
He's got the whole wide world in his pants
He wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band
Then put the whole wide world on her hands
She's got the whole wide world in her hands
He's got the whole wide world in his hands, in his hands

[Intro]
Takin' pictures of Q while he's sleepin'
It's a pastime
Uh

[Chorus]
Throw a steak on the grill, put the drink on chill (Chill)
This a muthafuckin' barbecue, for real (Real)
All these days already gone by (Gone by)
Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time
Put a little gin in the punch (Punch)
Grandma gettin' crunk, just fun
Nobody give a fuck (Fuck)
All these days already gone by (Gone by)
Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time

[Verse 1]
Hey, hey, hey
The door's open, I might as well just stroll in
Got some Arnie Palmer in my pitcher: call it Nolan
Ryan, try it once and then you go there
I am hopin' that we can kick it
Reminiscin' only about the good times
I know there's moments
When you probably love me, but you didn't wanna show it
Now I'm all around the globe, with everyone but you
I know you fuckin' miss me, chill and keep it cool
Never gettin' old, mane, grown, no Rogaine
Fill your plate with all that food, you better eat the whole thing
This a family reunion, all the grandmas be movin'
Runnin' in three-legged races, people would cry if they losin'
When I was two, my slide was blue
When I was gone, my ice cream cone was a giant wand
When my bike was all I was ridin' on
Jewelry from a Happy Meal, fuck it, I was happy still

[Chorus]
Throw a steak on the grill, put the drink on chill (Chill)
This a muthafuckin' barbecue, for real (Real)
All these days already gone by (Gone by)
Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time
Put a little gin in the punch (Punch)
Grandma gettin' crunk, just fun
Nobody give a fuck (Fuck)
All these days already gone by (Gone by)
Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time

[Verse 2]
Hey
Come and step inside the Electric Slide
Sprayin' squirt guns at you like it's pesticide
So why you buggin'?
Lil' man, stop buggin'
I gotta spend some time with some friends of mine
Get away from everything, go and rest your mind
It's not nothin'
Lil' man, it's not nothin'
All my little cousins actin' like some munchkins
Runnin' in the trees and they're cryin' out their eyes
Have to rush 'em to the ER, maybe just a Band-Aid will do it
You can sing along, please let the band play the music
Always nice you can come back home
Your friends go off, but then they come back grown
Nice to know that you're never alone
Family reunions whenever I'm home

[Chorus]
Throw a steak on the grill, put the drink on chill (Chill)
This a muthafuckin' barbecue, for real (Real)
All these days already gone by (Gone by)
Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time
Put a little gin in the punch (Punch)
Grandma gettin' crunk, just fun
Nobody give a fuck (Fuck)
All these days already gone by (Gone by)
Man, I ain't seen your ass in a long time (Long time)

I want to peel them clothes off your body like a banana (Like a banana)
The only reason I dress you in that designer (Why you do that?)
Is to get you out that Dolce & Gabbana (Ah)
I throw this money up (Up), she watch it all fall (Fall)
Toot that thang up (Up), p-pop it for a boss
Anything you wanting, baby, you can have it all
Starting with my last name, now they call you Mrs. McCall (Ah, ah, ah, ah)

Goons with me, dressed like skaters
Give you bruised kidneys, stretcher later
Man, my house is so big
Take the escalator to the elevators
Take the elevator to the private jet
Then I jet, nigga, see you later

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Ladies love me, I'm on my Cool J (Yellow model chick)
Ladies love me (Yellow bottle sipping)
Ladies love me, I'm on my Cool J (Yellow Lamborghini)
Ladies love me (Yellow top missing)

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
(Shawty Mane, I'm back)
Baby, I'm your doctor
I could be your rocker
Swaggin', I'm not braggin'
But I swear that I could rock you
Baby, I'm not crazy
I got swag like Patrick Swayze
You know the haters never phase me
That's not how my mama raised me
I am incredible, this is inedible
Killin' this track was inevitable
I am hetero, baby, you better know
JB is generally just TT
Look at me now, I said look at me!
Swaggin' with a Krook3d tee
Body slam the beat from D.B, call me Booker T
I said whoa there
Whoa there, baby, you just need to stop (Okay)
I'm busy, out performin' and I'm goin' to the top
I've got so much to lose so I'm steady gettin' guap
While them haters go down and we just get to watch (Ah)
Amazing, I'm blazing
Look over here, see that I'm amazing
Nobody's facing what I'm facing
Set a pace so I can race without pacing
Lace my shoes up, start racing
You can taste it, without fasteing
I mean fasting, start blasting
Call up Lauryn Hill, "Doo Wop That Thing"
Swagger jacking is not what I do
JB is the man, yeah, he's the truth
He's a beast when he steps up in the booth
I just landed, I did too
I'm a gentleman, yes, I'm a gentleman
I'm out of my element but I'm still elegant
I'm full of adrenaline, you know what that means
Louis V high tops with the skinny jeans

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Ladies love me, I'm on my Cool J (Yellow model chick)
Ladies love me (Yellow bottle sipping)
Ladies love me, I'm on my Cool J (Yellow Lamborghini)
Ladies love me (Yellow top missing)

[Outro]
David Banner (Banner)
Let you know something about me
I'm a Southern boy! Know what I'm talking about?

[Hook - Ned Cameron]
I remember all the days stuck in December
Caught in the rain, all the pain, having no money come my way
But now I'm making money even when I sleep
Eyes wide awake, but I really need a dream
We hustle, hustle

[Verse 1]
I go by Weezy, baby, so call me "Lil Weezle"
My city is New Orleans, baby, my street is Eagle
And that's my nigga's ?
He like to break a piece
He got the gun, I got the rope, my nigga pick a tree
Ain't talking money, I let the nickel speak
Niggas think I'm cheap, you ain't gon cent to me
The only thing to be: a picture on your shirt
No homo: I put your dick in the dirt
Flip em like a shovel with that wrist work
I stop ya, heard? I keep em coming like clockwork
J cool with the jump, it's an outburst
And we gon' be from South Philly til the South dirt
Baton Rouge, Lafayette or the Outskirts
It's lilWeezyana stay in your house jerk,
This ain't a concert, this ain't a hot verse
This a lot worse, so hear the shot burst:

[Hook - Ned Cameron]

Every hustle, we hustle, hustle - hey!

[Verse 2 - Kid Ink]
Straight from the bottom, now I'm high as a mountain
From the city where you need way more protection than a condom
Had a dream but I'm conscious, see the veins in my sockets
In the sky, wishing I could turn this plane into a rocket
And just leave here, more money but the problems still live here
I feel the pressure from my lil peers
Cause I'm about to blow, Swisher Sweet breathe in
One hit, lose your breath, all I do is (breathe) win
Big fish swimming in the deep end
No present, fuck I'm into pretense
I remember rainfall in the street
Now I'm in the club: watch me make this bitch precipitate
I promised to myself I would be the best
You could say I'm crazy or a mess
Just hand me a wrench
And it's nothing you can tell a ho
Life is just a bitch, I'll forgive her but I'll never forget

[Intro]
*Helicopter propellers*
"Well, the first thing I want to say is" (Uh)

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
They say real recognize real
The dollar bill will exercise our ills... E
Frauds is thoroughly camouflaged
And fatigued in the field, be careful who you believe
The pills is dealed like flaccid
Proceeds go towards the buyin' of Caprice Classics
With the wheels to match it, so they can mack it
Like an automatic weapon, steppin' off into traffic, like
"Check him," tears roll down the eyes of the rides
Inside of a funeral procession, here lies
Wit' Xs in his eyes, the unguided misdirected
Squad cars roll past and laugh

[Chorus: Willie Hutch, Lupe Fiasco]
Out there
Out there (Uh)

[?], hahaha
Uh

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
They say the streets is a demon in a dress
With dollar signs in her eyes and semen on her breath, uh
Scantly clad, no panties, deep throatin' in an alley
Agin' badly, in sunglasses, she pretty
Slain boyfriend names is tattooed on her titties
Sprinklin' greed, ignorance, and envy inside of a Phillie, uh
Hennessey tears, ass'll bring ya enemies here
Flirt wit'cha flaws 'til you run up in her raw

[Chorus: Willie Hutch, Lupe Fiasco]
You'll be out there (Uh)
Out there (

[?])
Out there (

[?])
And they say
Uh

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
They say the game has the belly of a beast
Blunts for fingers and hollow tips for teeth
Wiretaps for ears; Nike Airs for feet
Blasphemy for prayers; the system for a heart
Rap music for beats; heroin for a son
And it's married to the streets; crack pipes for lungs
And he never sleeps, just spies, with dice in his eyes
Loves life, 'cause he likes when it dies
With a bakin' soda soul, he cough up pleasure
Clothes made out of dollar bills that he sewed together (Uh)
He knows, he's clever, jail is his house
All the liquor that's poured out, goes right in his mouth
Rides around on a stray bullet; with prostitutes
Pimps, dope dealers, and killers tied to it to pull it (Uh)
A TV in his head, strippers slide down his legs
And he's known to ride around with the Feds, he's...

[Chorus: Willie Hutch, Lupe Fiasco, Willie Hutch, Lupe Fiasco ]
You'll be out there
Out there
Out there
Uh

[Verse 4: Lupe Fiasco]
But
Righteousness is a father teachin' his kids
That what's better than wealth, is the respect in the self
A pistol-packin' old lady standin' up
To the dope dealers on the block, makin' sure her presence is felt
A teacher teachin' that thinkin' is cool
Listen, before you mention "not lettin' school turn 'em into fools"
Keeping God first, Lupe is here
F-N-F up, homie, I'll see you

[Verse 1]
How can you tell
You're under a spell
You're compromised
You're miles away, slow

How can you know
When you're aiming low
There's nothing in your heart
Don't feel it in your soul
No standing O O O

[Verse 2]
Maybe you've noticed I'm ashamed
Of anything that I've done
Maybe you've noticed I'm not the same
As almost anyone

Why can't you see
You look funny to me
You trip and fall
I catch it all

[Verse 3]
How can you know
When you're aiming low
You're curling up, you're crawling now
No standing O O O

Maybe you're saying no this time
Dance right around my bones
It's okay, I'll be fine
I won't follow you home

[Verse 4]
Instead I turn my mood on a dime
I'm finally off of my back
I come from a long, long line
I mope and I cry and attack, ow ow

How can you tell
You're under my spell
You're compromised, you're miles away
No standing O O O

[Verse 5]
Maybe you've noticed I'm not afraid
Of everything that I've done
Maybe you've noticed I'm not the same
As almost anyone
Instead turn my mood on a dime
I'm finally off of my back
I come from a long, long line
I mope and I cry and attack

[Outro]
How can you tell
How can you tell

[Intro]

Incredible, incredible
Incredible, incredible
The story of my life be the makings of a real boy
If you live my life you will recognize a real boy
If you didn't know I'mma have to let you know
And I just wanna be incredible
Incredbile, incredible, Mr. Incredible

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I hear the people yellin, so it's time to get my save on
Bet that I could do in one day without a cape on
All I needs my Nikes, chain and my Bathing Ape on
And bet that I could clean this mess up without an apron
With no hesitation, got so much drive
All I need is four wheels and I'mma reach my destination
From where they on that cane like they need a hip replacement
Got on and got out, I even made a bitch replacement
Now she gon ride my dick til I need a dick replacement
Mr. Incredible, she still in amazement
Underground money safe in a dark basement
And I flash more than Powerpoint presentations
But with great power comes great responsiblity
The ones who don't cheer for me is trying to get rid of me
Im trying to make history, they trying to make me history
So I'mma see which one is really meant for me
The story of my life

[Hook: Earlly MacMillion]
The story of my life be the makings of a real boy
If you live my life you will recognize a real boy
If you didn't know I'mma have to let you know

Incredbile, incredible, Mr. Incredible

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
And I check my highlights every time the news is on
Still stand out if we wore the same uniform
And my chick is finer than them models, but only five four-a
Idolize Kimora and in love with my aura
But love seems to be every hero's downfall
So even if she treats like me a king, there's no crown for her
Bitch recognize this power in my punchlines
See me as a meal ticket, but I'm not a lunch line
Crying for my help, but I can't fit them in my schedule
Put me on a pedastal, but if I lost it all
Some would flip like they was flexible, fake ass niggas man
Swear to God, eat a dick and everything that's edible
And I can't save everything and all
I would need the world's biggest memory card
When I die and my grave says in memory of
I hope somebody else will rise above and become incredible

[Hook: Earlly MacMillion]
The story of my life be the makings of a real boy
If you live my life you will recognize a real boy
If you didn't know I'mma have to let you know
And I just wanna be incredible
Incredbile, incredible, Mr. Incredible

It's your show but anything goes
You ain't gotta worry, you can lose control

Here go a G stack, come sit on my lap (Ooh)
Now let me tell you what I'm here for (Ooh)

Get it? She gon', she gon' let me hit it

Ow! Ha
Hahaha

[Verse 1]
Solar rising red lung
Glisten under the sun
I wonder when it will part
From the snow

[Verse 2]
The melody's a mistake
Embrace at the wake
How long does it take
For us to know?

[Verse 3]
One whiff that's been blown
There's something unknown
Buried under the mound
Of snow

[Verse 4]
Found a fix for the fits
Come listen to this
As intimate as a kiss
Over a phone
And it goes

[Verse 5]
Found a fix for the fits
Come listen to this
It's buried under the hiss
And it glows

[Verse 6]
Like a powerful smile
Car radio dial
As intimate as a kiss
Over a phone
And it glows

[Hook]
(Listen up, listen up, listen up)
All I ever talk about is my fresh way
Excuse me, what's the problem here
What about you can't hear the words I say
Excuse me, what's the problem here
What about you can't hear all the words I say
If you listen up, you can hear me all day
All I ever talk about is keeping fresh way
Keeping my sway, keeping my A
A-A-A, I sway all day

[Verse 1]
You can come on your own or you can have a crew
You can step up like a man and I'll dance with you
You can thank me later or have an attitude
If you don't feel me now, you'll never feel me, boo

[Hook]
Excuse me, what's the problem here
What about me that you can't seem to hear
If you listen up, you can hear me all day
All I ever talk about is keeping fresh way
All I ever talk about is my fresh way
All I ever talk about is my fresh way
All I ever talk about is my fresh way
All I ever talk about is my fresh sway
Sway, sway, sway all day

I saw a little bug and I squashed it
I saw your little face and I brought it
And I step up in the club and I tore it

[Bridge]
Yeah, I been it, seen it

[Verse 2]
I invented swagger and I called it
Ordered me some tacos and enjoyed it
Sang my song and I made it
Put in my CD and I played it
Took it out the player and I tossed it
These rappers sounded really jaded
All these artists sounding so dated
Now I'm flossing - making money, made it
The rent was overdue, so I paid it
Police came in my house and raid it
Looking for some shit, but I flushed it

[Hook]

Brotha your money young, like that nigga Jeezy
These broke rappers, always rappin' 'bout a pink truck
I'm only happy, when I'm hoppin' out the Brinks truck
And I don't need a sixteen, I got a sentence

When I get in the game, they gon' play the benches
Fuck your friendship, pay attention
Bitch get at me? I'mma pay my henchmen

Mami stop fakin', talkin' bout, what? -
You got, you ain't got nathen, and you're not caking
You're not my taste, get out of my face
I play the top, like eight friends on your Myspace
Stay in a child's place, check the timin'

And if they ain't got the gat, they got the knife on (Yes sir!)
You're too wack, to get up on one of my songs (Whoop!)
You got a deal, cause you was givin' up the coochie, prolly (Uhn!)
But I'll arrange one hit, like "Oochie Wally" (Uhn!)
(Gone 'til November) And you'll be gone 'til November, like Wyclef ("You'll be gone, 'til November")
I hold weight and I ain't talkin' bout biceps
I rep Queens like a crown, when  I'm in the -
Town, ask Yung Joc, "It's Goin' Down" (Yes!)
Kisses to my bitches, and my niggas, get a pound
June, turn me up, (Mic check!) How I sound?

What up London, UK

Saw me with some other girls told her that she's next
She says she wants to hear my songs, holla' at Semtex
Understand I'm different and she listen what I spit
Met her at a club normally that ain't Cudi but
She was the cutest swag was tru-tru-tru-truest
Honest to the call I need 'em all
And she was leaving I had caught her at the door
She told me save I told her wait
I can't believe how she in my brain
Barely know her name
I love her facts, she ain't trippin on the fame
Day n' Nite thang the fools gold chain
The Crookers club banging and Plain Pat what up
So on my roster she was number one up
If the life was Mario she would be a 1-up
And she don't bark when the other girls wanna
Sign autographs then I'm on her ass
I'm done pimping for you
I'm done pimping for you
Cause I'm all about you
I'm done pimping for you
I'm done pimping for you
I'm done pimping for you
Cause I'm all about you
I'm done pimping for you

Wised up, now I'm with a dame
Nice butt, rolling in the Range
Love me even when I'm broke
Stay with me and never let me go
Wised up, now I'm with a dame
Nice butt, rolling in the Range
Love me even when I'm broke
Stay with me and never let me go
My gold marigolds attack
My black bed of roses
I’m going to bring 'em all back
With hypnosis, oh

And I know that I won’t be
The easiest to set free
And I know that I won’t be the last
Cold captain tied to the mast

I recall you on the telephone
I recall when you get mad
I will still love you to death
And I won't ever forget how

And I know that I won't be
The easiest to set free
And I know that I won't be the last
Cold captain tied to the mast

I'm on the other side
I'm satisfied
I'm a spirit dove
I'm looking for your love
I'm simple as a matter of fact
A punch in the nose don’t overreact
I will still love you to death
And I won’t ever forget how

And I know that I won't be
The easiest to set free
And I know that I won't be the last
Cold captain tied to the mast

And I know that I won't be the one
To securely know when it's wrong
But I hope I know when it's past
And I hope I know when to show you my
Whole love
Whole love
Whole love
Whole love

Whole love

Whole love
I won't ever forget how

I'm saying you got big and ain't ever act the same
Don't you dare act Hollywood
Don't you dare act Hollywood
Now when they see you out of town
They see you in the streets
They say you act funny
Man, you can't even speak
Don't you dare act Hollywood
Don't you dare act Hollywood

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Big, man I knew you do it big. New grid
With a house up on the hill
How I feel next to the sign that say, "Hollywood"
But I don't mean to act Hollywood
But my bitch is the baddest, ass is bigger than Jurassic
She moved out West, now she talking with an accent
Had a good doctor, now her titties look like plastic
Used to go to college, now she like, "Fuck a master!"
She gon' date an actor, rapper, lawyer, or a doctor
Somebody who could cop for her, get a ice rock for her
Maybe get a ring, she should date a boxer
And her friends don't even recognize her

[Hook]

[Earlly Mac]
Ooh, little mama, you so primadonna
Why you treat your Honda like it's a McLaren
I know you like nice things, Tiffany's and ice rings
Seen you down in campus
March is colder than that ice ring
Finna get your shade on, with your supermodel
He ain't gotta spill up though, I know he's super hollow
And I know you shallow ever since you hit that lotto
You been more in {bravo} like you want a pile o' 

[Cash]
While you play in roles, you in movies, you got Emmies
You got Benjies in your Fendi, does your Charger have a Hemi?
If no, let it go, wait a minute 'til you blow
They're gon' say you're Hollywood
They're just trying to steal the show

[Hook]

[Outro: Big Sean]
Do it

[Verse 1]
The lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh I beg, I beg and plead
Singin', come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head
And a trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singin'

[Chorus]
You are
You are

[Verse 2]
Confusion never stops
Closing walls and tickin' clocks
Gonna come back and take you home
I could not stop that you now know
Singin', come out upon my seas
Cursed missed opportunities
Am I a part of the cure?
Or am I part of the disease? Singin'

[Chorus]
You are
You are
You are
You are

[Chorus]
You are
You are

[Bridge]
And nothing else compares
Oh, nothing else compares
And nothing else compares

[Chorus]
You are
You are

[Outro]
Home, home, where I wanted to go
Home, home, where I wanted to go
Home (You are) home, where I wanted to go
Home (You are) home, where I wanted to go

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I want to leave, sometimes I want to cry
Sometimes I hate to bear the truth, sometimes I want to lie
Sometimes I want to school the youth, sometimes I want to ride
Sometimes I want to not think, sometimes I want to vibe
Sometimes I want to bump Tribe and zone out
This song's 'bout a young boy that's gone wild inside
When my world collide
With your world where your girl and your kids reside
We killed the facades, we feel free to fly
We're birds that reserve in the charismatic sky
I care about my pride too much
If my clothes is new, if my ride is plush
If my hair is cut, if my diamonds is crushed
I look in the mirror, I'm trendy enough? Wrong
Insecurity roams the black community
Homes where kids must have jewelry
The high school female need earrings and details
So she can be cool to be, amongst popularity
The various name brands that reached the price scan
It's not about the right price but more like the right scam
To rule us all, confuse us all
Hit the bank within five minutes and then withdraw
Now let's draw
The picture of a rapper with a chain and Range that is not paid for
My cousin from the South said he just bought him a house
That lives around his neck like a white collar
So why fast forward? then I'll rewind, a time machine can help me double back to slavery times
Picking cotton from a field that a white man own
The blacker you are, farther you're from the white man's home
Negro spiritual songs, gave us some type of sanity
Before your vanity, they parted our families
They put us in hundred degree shade and outside we bathed
The more we were afraid, the more they made rules
And trapped our minds in a cage, our freedom was so vague
Couldn't see it with the eyes of Tracee Ross (uh)
And school was exempt, see we couldn't have smarts
And a smirk could get you hurt, wounded first from a scar
400 years of nothing, 400 years of suffering
400 years of tears, and tribulations, miseducation
See what we facing is now coming back to the roots
Remember whips on our back and if we would run they would shoot
Called us niggers and figured that we never live in pursuit
Of happiness, we capture these feelings in things that we do
Thought of abstinence of slavery but we made it come to
About a perspective, my shoe selection gotta be Louie
Her hand bag gotta be Gucci, it's fake then she fool me
She still bad though, and her fake Gucci ain't that bad though
We filling up the gas for Rollies
Upgrade to 26's after riding Kobes
My cousin from the South, slavery start in the South and I bet ya
He overcompensates for the life of his ancestors
So blame it on the 400 years we never saw
The reason why the next 400 we gotta floss
Slaves

[Outro]
I said the 400 years we never had nothing
Barely had clothes on our back
Is the reason why when we get a little bit of change
We over exaggerate on our living expenses
So if you get your first big check and you cop a chain before you buy a house
You're a vanity slave
If you're a female and you got 4,5,6 rings on your finger
Four holes in your left ear and a nose piercing
You're a vanity slave
If you got an 02' Monte Carlo with 24's on it
And on the back of the window it says, "Get on my level ho"
You're a vanity slave
We're all vanity slaves, and with that being said
Can somebody please tell me where the mall at?
I'm not from around here, hey Ali, where we at? Idaho?
Yeah nigga, you know the first of the month, checks coming in
I'm tryna get some
What up?
How you say you innocent? Illegitimate children
Ain't gon hurt, who feels it? Artists with ?
Fuck em, middle finger never bent
Only at the Lord's gates, judging me to let me in
It's funny, but it's federal bills
Spend it from siblings
Since they figured it in, back turns, no friends
I'm only human, fly as Donatella Versace
We all die soon, like ? on the autopsy
Hard-bodied
Body eroded, gets you buried with black roses
Time

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah
I live life like the weekend (weekend)
Get it in every night til the week end (week end)
Stay up til' the sun rise then we sleep in (yeah)
Hard work got my bank account peakin' (peakin')
Shit straight, you can trust me
Niggas gon' hate, but the hoes just love me (love me)
Don't it sound so good
How a youngin' so fresh with a style so hood

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Got visions of your man, broke and doin' bad
Fans stand in line just to take pictures of your man
Flow hot, should be in the kitchen with the pans
Money be on the floor stacked to the ceiling with the fan
I'm living what I'm saying
Name known everywhere I go, west coast to the buildings in Japan
Trying to keep them dollar signs fillin' up my pants
So I don't need weight, the boy got cake
See me in every city, different broad in every state
Niggas all got new intentions cause I'm winning in the race
I make a broad turn groupie
She like, "gosh, look at all this Gucci"
I have her in the crib late night, in the crib rollin' that stink up
Now she talkin' bout getting inked up
I don't see ya'll weak fucks
Now that ya'll swole me and Neako linked up
Now we gon' eat up

[Hook]
Yeah
I live life like the weekend (weekend)
Get it in every night til the week end (week end)
Stay up til' the sun rise then we sleep in (yeah)
Hard work got my bank account peakin' (peakin')
Shit straight, you can trust me
Niggas gon' hate, but the hoes just love me (love me)
Don't it sound so good
How a youngin' so fresh with a style so hood

[Verse 2: Neako]
Wizzle listen, this is where them and us both differ
Before they had the voice now they have the picture
And we will deliver
We are the stars, the big dippers, get it?
High sky scrapin', the constellations
My flow forsaken and they cannot take it
And I'm gon' give it and they will not make it
My flow coke an I'm gon' bake it
But I never sold it, more like a weed tota
Motorola, Nextel chirpa
Your girl is a slurpa, but you don' know it
Young Wiz told me, he put his homie on it
And I ran up on it, and we had a moment or two
You ain't seen me since, how lonely are you?
You sad and you're weepin'
I'm comin' right back, I'mma see you next weekend

[Hook]
Yeah
I live life like the weekend (weekend)
Get it in every night til' the week end (week end)
Stay up til the sun rise then we sleep in (yeah)
Hard work got my bank account peakin' (peakin')
Shit straight, you can trust me
Niggas gon' hate, but the hoes just love me (love me)
Don't it sound so good
How a youngin' so fresh with a style so hood

[Chorus]
This is how I tell it
Oh, but it’s long
One Sunday morning
Oh, one son is gone

[Verse 1]
I can see where they’re dawning
Over the sea
My father said what I had become
No-one should be

Outside I look lived in
Like the bones in a shrine
How am I forgiven?
Oh, I’ll give it time

[Verse 2]
This, I learned without warning
Holding my brow
In time he thought I would kill him
Oh, but I didn’t know how
I said it’s your god I don’t believe in
No, your Bible can’t be true
Knocked down by the long life
He cried, ’I fear what waits for you’

[Verse 3]
I can hear those bells
Spoken and gone
I feel relief, I feel well
Now he knows he was wrong

Ring ’em cold for my father
Frozen underground
Jesus, I wouldn’t bother
He belongs to me now

[Verse 4]
Something sad keeps moving
So I wandered around
I fell in love with the burden
Holding me down

Bless my mind, I miss
Being told how to live
What I learned without knowing
How much more that I owe that I can give

[Chorus]
This is how I tell it
Oh, but it’s long
One Sunday morning
Oh, one son is gone

[Verse 1]
If I could take a trip to outer space
She would be the one I will see when I get to Heaven's gate
She would welcome me with her arms open wide
And a smile will shadow me brighter than the sun
She hasn't had a fair chance, so I'll give her one
Let me tell you who she is, yeah

[Chorus]
(She's a fallen angel) Sent from Heaven up above
(She's a fallen angel) Waiting for me to love her, yeah
(Ooh, she's a fallen angel) Take your judgment off her
I know that (She's a fallen angel)
You know I—

[Verse 2]
Maybe I should help her mend her broken wings
So she can fly again
But I don't wanna lose everything that I've gained
It's turning me a selfish man, oh
'Cause without her my heart just don't go, no more, no more
I couldn't take the pain from watching her fly away
So say that you'll stay, she's mine

[Chorus]
(She's a fallen angel) Ooh, sent from Heaven up above
(She's a fallen angel) Waiting for me to love her, yeah
(Ooh, she's a fallen angel) So take your judgment off her
I know that (She's a fallen angel)
Don't you—

[Bridge]
Baby, don't you worry, I'm gon' help you fly
(Don't you worry, I'm gon' help you—, I'm gon' help you fly)
Just take me under your wing and we can reach the sky
(Take me under—, we can reach the—, we can reach the sky)
Baby, don't you worry, I'm gon' help you fly
(Don't you worry, I'm gon' help you—, I'm gon' help you fly)
Lil' mama, don't you worry, you're gon' reach the sky
(Take me under—, we can reach the—, we can reach the sky)

[Chorus]
She's a
(She's a fallen angel) Hey, hey, sent from Heaven up above just for me
(She's a fallen angel) Waiting for me to wrap my arms around her now
(Ooh, she's a fallen angel) We can do without the judgment, oh
I know that (She's a fallen angel)
Yeah, oh, woah

[Outro]
Baby, I know, I know that they done hurt you
But I'm here to take it all away
So if you let me, you know what, just put your heart in my hands
And everything they said, I take it back like this
Gnihton neam t'nod uoy, ay tnaq t'nod I
Ay deen t'nod I, reven devol ya
Ydobon er'uoy, ll'uoy reven ekam ti
Er'uoy a ekatsim, ho
You don't mean nothing, I don't want ya
I don't need ya, never loved ya
You're a nobody, you'll never make it
You're a mistake, oh

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Young Money!
Yeah
Four
Ahem!

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I tell her, "Now go and pop that pussy for a real nigga"
I already know that life is deep, but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord as my witness
So on my Libra scale I'm weighin' sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well, just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm danglin' my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me: nose-bleed seats
And today I went shoppin' and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split!

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, "Baby, it's real."
And I say, "I ain't doubt you for a second."
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here
Baby, you know the deal
And she bad, so maybe she won't, ugh
But shit, then again, maybe she will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, she will, she will, ugh
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now
She will, she will, she will (Ugh)
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will

[Interlude: Lil Wayne]
Yeah

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I tell her, "Now go and pop that pussy for me!"
Haters can't see me, but them bitches still lookin' for me
And you could take that to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about I, give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her 'til she cry—call that "whine 'n' dine"
Try to check me and I'ma have 'em checkin' pulses
They say, "Choose wisely," that's why I was chosen
Rockin' like asphalt, it's the cash fault
Looked in the face of Death and took its mask off
Now, I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl face south and her ass north
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split!

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, "Baby, it's real."
And I say, "I ain't doubt you for a second."
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off
And go anywhere but here, baby, you know the deal
‘Cause she bad so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit, then again, maybe she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will
Maybe for the money and the power
And the fame right now, she will
Do it for the realest niggas
In the fuckin' game right now, she will

[Outro: Drake]
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, "Baby, it's real."
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel (I feel like the sky is opening, and I am entering)
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here baby you know the deal
(Feel like like the world is falling and I am rising)
'cause she bad, so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit then again maybe she will
Carter 4 Tunechi
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, she will, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now
She will, she will, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, she will, she will
I think I love her

[Verse 1]
Was I wrong?
Off all night long?
So high
As the stinking sun
I came alive then I felt, oh uh oh
Some guys have everything I know

[Chorus]
It’s alright
I've done a lot of crawling around outside
And I heard it's alright

[Verse 2]
Your sno-cone, and it's piss and blood
It’s in the cards, oh oh
'Get Well Soon - everybody'
Do all lies have a taste?
Let it go, I don’t know, oh
A cow’s neck, bad shave, in the low blow slo-mo

[Chorus]
It’s alright
You won't set the kids on fire
Oh, but I might, oh

[Verse 3]
You come on, sentimental
If the solar car’s coming, I’m home
The Magna Carta’s on a Slim Jim blood, brutha
The sunk soul with the coal clean toe is the mutha

[Chorus]
Yeah, that’s right
When you gonna find out
I’m all inside
You still might

[Refrain]
It's alright
It's alright

[Chorus]
It’s alright
You won't set the kids on fire
Oh, but I might, oh

[Refrain]
It's alright
It's alright

Walk inside the club, make them hoes touch they toes

Fuck all them blogs, bitch, I'm on my job
You keep talkin' down, I bet you get yo' ass robbed
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em, bitch, I'm headed to the top
Pretty boy swag, man, them hoes on my cock

[Verse]
Cole world, cold blooded
Trapping niggas at my shows and them hoes love it
Backpacking niggas with the afros love it
So don't holla at a nigga if you got no budget
Trying to get my braid up, nope not talking cornrows
Trying to get my grade up, oh, look how my score rose
Playing Jigga hits he say good, make more those
Cole got delivery bitch, you got digiornos
They fucking with me because I'm real as shit
Well if you feel this shit, here goes some realer shit
I signed a big deal and went to the dealership
Man they took one look at my credit and said forget it
Now I'm in this train with a mil to my name
Ain't shit changed because I still feel the pain
Like a gym or a rim dog, I'm built for the game
Something like a pimp because I'm still with the 'caine
Unh, a little drug dealer reference what, I can't try
These niggas out here lying, why can't I
Flashbacks where my teacher told me I can't fly
Then he looked at nigga crazy because I say why
Now look, no wings but I'm flier than the birds
Co-signer on a beamer, but it's whiter than the burbs
Something like a genius, but man I've done been a nerd
Just to tutor bad bitches while admiring the curves
That might have been a noun, that might have been a verb
But I'm just trying to find what you hiding in that skirt
Hey Cole got her coming now he might've been the first
So she only fuck with hymn/him like a choir in a church
Good God, momma told him get a good job
Be a doctor or a lawyer, if you're black they won't employ ya'
Well nigga I'mma show ya', this that Jesse Jackson
Af-firmative action so master I'm taxing uh
Don't let the cover fool ya', bitch I ain't no freshman
In my own class man, I write my own passes
I hear the shots fired, yeah I see the stones casted
My shit is already fire, don't gas it
Niggas hear my album say sound like a classic
Niggas say your album might not even see the plastic
Bastard, how you gonna match with a nigga
Who done mastered the shit you practice
Catch this, a Ville nigga 'til the day of my casket
Put on for my city like my favorite jacket
Man you gonna wear that every god damn night
Know what I paid for this shit? bitch, you got damn right!

[Verse 1]
I wadn't lookin' for ya, I wadn't searchin'
I wadn't creepin' around, I wadn't lurkin'
I wadn't sleepin' around, I wadn't thirstin'
But I got a thang for ya, I got a thang for ya
You on ya job and it's damn sure workin'
Say she ain't a ho, but she far from a virgin
When it's time to cut, I'm somethin' like a surgeon
I do my thang for you
Hey, baby girl you gotta trunk, I might put you in valet
Way you stretching make a man think I put you in ballet
If I'm sliding through your city, I need you to dial me
And how much my niggas smoke reminding you of Friday
I can take you to DC, introduce you to Wale
You can look all through my phone as long as you don't call Jay
Is it cool to parle, we can do this all day
Just me and you off in my room, we call this do the hard way, hard way

[Chorus]
I put it down, any spot, any city that I'm in (Hey)
Let the bad girls know we run the town
So pick up that cellphone and tell a friend
To tell a friend, I put it down
Any spot, any city that I'm in (Hey)
Let the bad girls know we run the town
And my niggas blow trees like the wind, so tell a friend

[Post-Chorus]
To bring a friend and bring 'em in
Bring 'em in, bring 'em in
And if they all bad you can bring 'em in
We take it to the grr, it's just you, me, and them

[Verse 2]
Now bring ya ass over here
A nigga tryna take you home like a souvenir
One in a million, girl, you lookin' like you knew Aaliyah
And ah, I got a thang for ya, I got a thang for ya
A stewardess and yet you flew the leer
'Cause you're fly as hell, shawty walking through the air
Game cold like the toes on a polar bear
And ah, I do my thang for ya
Now baby girl if looks can kill then you catchin' bodies
How I'm stretching you, guess no need to go get pilates
When I'm sliding through ya city, meet me in the lobby
And you put that thang up on me like you tryna rob me
Can I hit it in the mornin' while you moanin'? Prob'ly
Got you sweatin', now you gettin' wet as a tsunami
We can do this all day, treat it like a hobby
But if I tell you get to stepping like you Pam and Tommy, don't mind me

[Chorus]
I put it down, any spot, any city that I'm in (Hey)
Let the bad girls know we run the town
So pick up that cellphone and tell a friend
To tell a friend, I put it down
Any spot, any city that I'm in (Hey)
Let the bad girls know we run the town
And my niggas blow trees like the wind, so tell a friend

[Post-Chorus]
To bring a friend and bring 'em in
Bring 'em in, bring 'em in
And if they all bad you can bring 'em in
We take it to the grr, it's just you, me, and them

[Verse 3]
Did I meet you for a reason or for a season
Or either the night of ya life at the Four Seasons?
Whisper to ya home girl you love Cole World
'Cause his flow thorough, I give you a few more reasons
Not because his verse or 'cause I can buy purse
You know, the type of shit your man could only purchase on the first
And not because he faker than turf, softer than Nerf footballs
I got his girl's lip gloss all on my girth
Because I'm so clever better than ho-eva
The coldest nigga even when wearin' like four sweaters
Well versed, well rehearsed, the go getter
These broke niggas got good dressing and no lettuce (Argh)
You would think niggas would know better
It's oh-eleven, you would think niggas would flow better
I know you're so fed up
And so I had to blow and I ain't talking coke header, I won't let up

[Chorus]
I put it down, any spot, any city that I'm in (Hey)
Let the bad girls know we run the town
So pick up that cellphone and tell a friend
To tell a friend, I put it down
Any spot, any city that I'm in (Hey)
Let the bad girls know we run the town
And my niggas blow trees like the wind, so tell a friend

[Post-Chorus]
To bring a friend and bring 'em in
Bring 'em in, bring 'em in
And if they all bad you can bring 'em in
We take it to the grr, it's just you, me, and them

[Intro]
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh

[Verse 1]
Day and night
I toss and turn, I keep stress in my mind, mind
I look for peace but see I don't attain
What I need for keeps, this silly game we play, play
Now look at this
Madness the magnet keeps attracting me, me
I try to run but see I'm not that fast
I think I'm first but surely finish last, last

[Chorus]
'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night

[Verse 2]
Hold the phone
The lonely stoner, Mr. Solo Dolo
He's on the move, can't seem to shake the shade
Within his dreams he sees the life he made, made
The pain is deep
A silent sleeper, you won't hear a peep, peep
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through

[Chorus]
'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night

[Verse 3]
Slow mo'
When the tempo slows up and creates that new, new
He seems alive though he is feelin' blue
The sun is shinin', man he's super cool, cool
The lonely nights
They fade away, he slips into his white Nike's
He smokes a clip and then he's on the way
To free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of

[Chorus]
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night, night
At, at, at night, night

[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah, what's good baby?
Shit, I ain't seen you in a minute
Now you wanna' hit me

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Shawty I'mma tell you something you don't wanna' hear(yeah), hear(yeah), hear(yeah)
You threw a nigga to the curb
I fronted like I didn't even care(yeah), care(yeah), care(yeah)
But deep down
I needed your umbrella couldn't make it through the rain(yep), rain(yep), rain(Yep)
So I been fuckin' everthing in this town trying to run from the pain, pain, pain
And now suddenly you say you wanna chat, but what is that?
You feel like Kobe, like I'm Shaq
Look how you need a nigga back
Ironic
You burned my heart up like some chronic
Now you say you want it once mo' but what fo'
You did me dirty like some must
So shit why would I?
Plus my niggas know you played me so how could I?
Nah fuck trynna look cool I ain't nobody's fool

Now you wanna show up?
You saying that you feenin' for me screaming to me
Boy I need you bad

[Hook: Jazmine Sullivan]
Boy I need you bad as my heart beat (Bad like the food I eat)
Bad as the air I breathe (Baby I want you bad)

What I gotta do? (Baby I want you bad)
I need you(I)
I need you(I, I)
Do it all for you (Baby I need you) Hey

[Verse 2: Jazmine Sullivan]
Baby there's nothing I wouldn't do
To get back what we had when love was true
No lie, I'd give up all I got
Just so I can get back in my spot

[Hook Repeated]

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Oh, you want me bad how the cops want black folks
Bad like Dirty Diana
Bad like black toast
Bad like sour lactose like that crack smoke
You feenin'
Left a nigga out to dry like some semen
Baby deaded me
Was far from a dog I had no pedigree, Unh
No leash needed
You ripped up your lease speeded out the crib
Now I'm supposed to just forget and forgive
Pardon, you say I'm your heart
But baby how bad do you want it, want it?

[Outro w/repeated Hook: Jazmine Sullivan]
When you want him so bad and you gotta get him back say Oh-oh,oh,oh(Oh-oh,oh,oh)
Cuz' it won't get no better til' you are together say Oh-oh,oh,oh(Oh-oh,oh,oh)
If you believe in ya love and you can't give him up say Oh-oh,oh,oh(Oh-oh,oh,oh)
If there's nothing you won't do to get back with your boo say Oh-oh,oh,oh(Oh-oh,oh,oh)

[Verse: Chris Brown]
Where you been? Where you been all my life?
Baby, it's a sin, the way you looking alive
It's obvious that I want something from you
And you know what
What I wanna do, do, do

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
If we touched, it would bring me to life
I can only imagine, only imagine what it'd be like
Oh, every time, it will bring me to life
I can only imagine, only imagine
What it'd be like, what it'd be like
What it'd be like, like, like
What it'd be like, like, like, like, like, like

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
Saw you, saw you, saw you from afar, thought I'd say, "Wassup"
You can tell me your name, when we wakin' up
They, they call me Tunechi, I'm good, I'm Gucci
Now you can kiss your old dude goodbye, smooches
You're a beast, yo-you're a beauty
Man, I think somebody done gave Cupid a Uzi
Sh-shoot me, you're a firework, brighter in the dark
So let's turn off the lights, and give me that spark

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
If we touched, it would bring me to life
I can only imagine, only imagine what it'd be like
Oh, every time, it will bring me to life
I can only imagine, only imagine
What it'd be like, what it'd be like
What it'd be like, like, like
What it'd be like, like, like, like, like, like

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
I want your love to touch me, one touch will feel free
(It would bring me to life)
I want to feel free, so I can finally be (If you kiss me)
So I can finally be (Girl), so I can finally be (Give me now)
So I can finally see, so I can finally see (Give me now)
What, what, what

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
Saw you, saw you, saw you from afar, thought I'd say, "Wassup"
You can tell me your name, when we wakin' up
They, they call me Tunechi, I'm good, I'm Gucci
Now you can kiss your old dude goodbye, smooches
You're a beast, yo-you're a beauty
Man, I think somebody done gave Cupid a Uzi
Sh-shoot me, you're a firework, brighter in the dark
So let's turn off the lights, and give me that spark

[Outro: Chris Brown]
What it'd be like

[Intro: Chris Brown]
Hahaha, right
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
I hear 'em talkin' 'bout this
Can't fight the feeling
Hahaha, haha
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Leggo, look, haha
Can't fight the feeling

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Do you think I give a **** what you think about me?
I got my chin up, brother walkin' properly
Almost off them papers so no coppers bother me
Fuck walkin' on eggshells, Father, help me please
I'm duckin' slugs, I'm in higher water so they leech
You got the game effed up, but it's all G
I choose it 'cause this music's therapeutic to my brain cells
And when I'm stupid, yeah, I lose it, I don't think well
Yeah, and for this moolah, I'm a Road Runner
You can't stop the party, boy, you won't fuck my fun up
Might just have to call them boys, then they gonna run up
Pretty little facelift, yeah, you gettin' done up
I light a candle for the homies that's history
You light a candle just to save electricity
Let me calm down, I don't wanna get tazed
I just bought this outfit and these shades
I'm ballin' hard, nigga, hit that replay
And all my haters die slow and decay

[Interlude: Chris Brown]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Haha, look, haha, leggo
Can't fight the feeling

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Give me four quarters and a few Vitamin Waters
I guess to win in this game I just gotta fuck reporters
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
A nigga somersault, naw, it's not what the doctor ordered
Red shots is on your forehead
Can't fight the feeling
Block up, they recordin'
Now I'm on the West Coast ridin' in that low-low
With a couple killers who be hidin' from the popo
Know they got the best smoke, feel like you in slow-mo
But I don't smoke that shit so no, that weren't no promo
V.A. yeah, we hard, bitch
'Cause everywhere I go, I feel like I'm a target
I'm a star, you just start shit
Superhero switchin' fists like I'm Clark Kent

[Interlude: Kevin McCall]
Yeah
Superman that ho
Check, look

[Verse 3: Kevin McCall]
See the waitress makin' double, I guess you can say I'm tipsy
I'm all about my hustle like my first name Nipsey
Breezy brought me on, so I be wherever Chris be
I'm the next to blow, believe it or not, Ripley's
Biggest thing in L.A., how can you miss me?
Tell the bank teller keep them hundreds extra crispy
Cash rules everythin' around me
I see your mouth movin' but you ain't really sayin' shit like the lip-sync
A lot of chicks on my teams so they call me coach
My dick game got them buggin', call it cockroach
How you fly as me? I don't fly coach
Nigga, I'm sick so when I spit it's fuckin' gross
That's dope, huh, nigga, that's dope
Iced in the bitch but I ain't never seen the slopes
Californication, I'm reppin' the West Coast
East Side, young niggers, my cousins are straight Locs

[Outro: Kevin McCall]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Haha
Can't fight the feeling
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Can't fight the feeling

[Intro]
Yeah
It's Young Khalifa
Mr. Look-the-fuck-up, all that
Feelin' real good about life
Got a drink poured, blunt lit
Let's go

[Verse]
Excuse me
My jeans Levi, my shoes is Gucci
Hoes like "Who he?"
On a paper chase, don't waste my loose leaf
A nigga paying bills, lighting L's on the beach
But I still move with the goons on a loose leash
Some call it weird, hoes call it unique
Swag like I just stepped out a boutique
And I spit like I got a mouth full of loose teeth
Closet full of new sneaks that I'll probably never wear
I'm in that President Suite, bad bitch
And if them niggas ain't me, average
I treat a beat like canvas
Bob Ross on a song, paint it perfect
Ever run out of weed, I'll throw a purp fit
I keep the army at ease 'cause y'all ain't worth it
Been considered hipster 'cause my shirts fit
The way your bitch hit my chirp make a hip hurt
Young nigga ridin' that wave, picture me surfin'
OT, probably see me in your circuit
Same niggas hate, the same ones on my first shit
Now that's irony
Hoes wanna frequent me, flow wrinkle free, no iron needed
I'm on a level y'all dyin' to be at
Or somewhere you gotta fly to be at
You know Leto's home
So we spendin' up the grands on the sand gettin' blowed
Four or five freaks at least, new in my phone
Give you my address, GPS to my home
I party like I own stocks
Smoke blunts with CEO's who own their own yachts
Chillin' with bad hoes who pour their own shots
And pop pills, while I approve million dollar deals
Niggas in a frenzy, city cops on my heels
But I'm too rich to give a fuck
Besides hate, the money gettin' up
The money, the money, the money gettin' up
The money gettin' up, the money gettin' up
The money, the money, the money gettin' uuuppp
The money gettin' up (tahahahaa)
The money gettin' up

[Outro]
Yeah bitch!
Taylor Gang or kill yourself man
Look in the mirror, shoot the first thing you see
Yeah, that's not me, that's you
Bitch!

[Hook]
Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill
Sha-shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill

[Verse 1: Kev tha Hustla]
So baby come fly with a nigga who space surf
She know how to dive, she don't jump, it's face first
I let her log on and play with my laptop
“We so high up Heinz Field in the backdrop
I roll a bat she catch balls like a backstop
D-12 baby and ya man just a matchbox
I get cash really honey this is me
I'm the drug she's a plug, she in love with tha D
Never give it to her raw, no seeds like tha weed
So don't be blind to the fact, baby girl come and see
I get money with an attitude that's mad cash
But when you walked past, I was like damn
She want me to give her my all
I'm talkin' one night, no feelings involved
Early morn no passion
Show her my flight school skills, no crashin'

[Hook]
Girl ya lovin got me gone, me gone, me gone
You're like a drug to me I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm rollin, I'm rollin', I'm rollin, I'm rollin'
I'm rollin, I'm rollin', I'm rollin, I'm rollin'
Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill
Shawty-shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill
Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill
Shawty-shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill
Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill (I'm rollin, I'm rollin)
Shawty-shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill (I'm rollin, I'm rollin)
Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill (I'm rollin, I'm rollin)
Shawty-shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill (I'm rollin, I'm rollin)

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Okay!
Uh oh, everything Taylor'd, room with no neighbors
Hop inside and we'll fly where a bird or a plane is
What your name is, and who ya came with, listen
I'mma take you out and put in the right position, oh
And tell your nigga I ain't trippin
Never fallin' off, I ain't slackin' on my pimpin'
Niggas call me weirdo, bitches call me different
Send me naked pics when I'm on the road
Just to let you know, I think it's beautiful
Soon as I get home, I'm rushin' over like a head start
Fresh up out the shower to the sofa, skip the bed part
A sharp shooter, young Bret Hart
Probably would like to, Hollywood night you
Red eye flight you, somewhere near we can get lost
And let you pop off, gone

[Hook]
Girl ya lovin got me gone, me gone, me gone
You're like a drug to me I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm rollin, I'm rollin', I'm rollin, I'm rollin'
I'm rollin, I'm rollin', I'm rollin, I'm rollin'
Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill
Shawty-shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill
Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill
Shawty-shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill
Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill (I'm rollin, I'm rollin)
Shawty-shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill (I'm rollin, I'm rollin)
Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill (I'm rollin, I'm rollin)
Shawty-shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill (I'm rollin, I'm rollin)

[Chorus]
If you fall asleep down by the water
Baby I’ll carry you all the way home
If you fall asleep down by the water
Baby I’ll carry you all the way home

[Verse 1]
Everybody’s gotta love someone
But I just wanna love you dear
Everybody’s gotta feel something
I just wanna be with you, you my dear
I know its hard, I know its hard
I know its hard to be in this position
If they stop loving you, I won’t stop loving you
If they stop needing you, I’ll still need you my dear

[Chorus]
If you fall asleep down by the water
Baby I’ll carry you all the way home
If you fall asleep down by the water
Baby I’ll carry you all the way home

[Verse 2]
You gotta believe me when I say
When I say the word forever
And whatever comes your way
We’ll still be here together
I know its hard, I know its hard
But I understand you, just take my hand

[Chorus]
If you fall asleep down by the water
Baby I’ll carry you all the way home
If you fall asleep down by the water
Baby I’ll carry you all the way home

[Verse 1]
Yeah, man made powers
Stood like a tower, higher and hi ya, hello
And the higher you go, you feel lower, oh
I was close to the ant
Staying undercover, staying undercover
With a nose to the ground, I found my sound
Got myself an interview tomorrow
I got myself a jacket for a dollar
And my nails are chipped but I'm eager
And the car doesn't work, so I'm stuck here

[Hook 1]
Yeah, I don't wanna live for tomorrow, I push my life today
I throw this in your face when I see ya, I got something to say
I throw this shit in your face when I see ya
Cause I got something to say

[Hook 2]
I was born free, born free
I was born free, born free
Born free, born free
Born free, born free

[Verse 2]
You could try to find ways to be happier
You might end up somewhere in Ethiopia
You can think big with your idea
You ain't never gonna find Utopia
Take a bite out of life, make it snappier, yeah
Ordinary gone super trippier
So I check shit cause I'm lippier
And split a Czech like Slovakia

[Hook 1]
Yeah, I don't wanna live for tomorrow, I push my life today
I throw this in your face when I see ya
Cause I got something to say
I throw this shit in your face when I see ya
Cause I got something to say

[Hook 2]
I was born free, born free
I was born free, born free
Born free, born free
Born free, born free

[Verse 3]
I don't wanna talk about money cause I got it
And I don't wanna talk about hoochies cause I been it
And I don't wanna be that fake but you can do it
And imitators, yeah, speak it
Oh lord, whoever you are
Yeah, come out wherever you are
Oh lord, whoever you are
Yeah, come out wherever you are
And tell 'em

[Hook 2]
I was born free, born free
I was born free, born free
Born free, born free
Born free, born free

[Verse 1]
He put it on me, I put it on
Like there was nothing wrong
It didn't fit, it wasn't right
Wasn't just the size
They say you know when you know
I don't know

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I didn't feel the fairytale feeling, no
Am I a stupid girl
For even dreaming that I could?

[Chorus 1]
If it's not like the movies
That's how it should be, yeah
When he's the one, I'll come undone
And my world will stop spinning
And that's just the beginning, yeah

[Verse 2]
Snow White said when I was young
"One day my prince will come"
So I wait for that date
They say it's hard to meet your match
Gotta find my better half
So we make perfect shapes

[Pre-Chorus 2]
If stars don't align, if it doesn't stop time
If you can't see the sign
Wait for it
One hundred percent, worth every penny spent
He'll be the one that finishes your sentences

[Chorus 2]
If it's not like the movies
That's how it should be, yeah
When he's the one, he'll come undone
And my world will stop spinning
And that's just the beginning, oh-oh yeah

[Bridge]
'Cause I know you're out there
And you're, you're looking for me
Oh-oh-oh
It's a crazy idea that
You were made perfectly for me, you see

[Chorus 3]
Just like the movies
That's how it will be
Cinematic and dramatic, with the perfect ending, ohh
It's not like the movies, oh
But that's how it should be, yeah
When he's the one, you'll come undone
And your world will stop spinning
And it's just the beginning

[Intro]
I know I sound so stupid saying this but uh...
I really like you

[Verse 1]
Girl you don't know what you are to me
You are my baby doll
You are my compass star
You drive me up the wall
Girl you don't know what you mean to me
You are my everything
You are my alien
From S-p-a-c-e

[Hook x3:]
Please don't go
Wait
I just met you

[Verse 2]
Girl I feel just like a bird
Though I am just a nerd
I could fly around this world
With power from this word
We'll bring the desert rain clouds
Fuck reality and doubt
Well they'll be vultures I see
And they'll chase me
Girl I'm flying with thee

[Refrain]
Roses are red
Yellow and white
Where have you been all my life
Violets are blue
And I’ll be too
If you leave
Cause I just met you

[Hook x3:]
Please don't go
Wait
I just met you

[Bridge]
You're my pop rocks
You're my cotton candy
When the beach is hot n sandy
You're my water
You're my morning shower
Sub-conscious melody
You're my LSD
Summer's perfect daughter

[Refrain x3:]
Roses are red
Yellow and white
Where have you been all my life
Violets are blue
And I'll be too
If you leave
Cause I just met you (I just met you)

[Outro]
I’m Sorry
But I got to
Got to go
I gotta go
Sorry
But I got to
Got to go
I gotta go
Sorry
But I got to
Got to go
I gotta go
Sorry
But I got to
Got to go
I gotta go
(I just met you)

[Part 1 - B.o.B]
(Hook)
Well, I’m gonna make a lot of money (make a lot of money)
Then I’m gonna quit this, quit this crazy scene

Well I'm a quit this crazy scene
Cause being famous ain't all what they make it to be
But back then y'all this was my favorite dream
But now, I wouldn't hesitate I would leave
Cause I'mma

(Hook)

Oh, well I guess got problems
I dropped out of school
Ain’t think about college
So my apologies to my mother and father
For bein' stubborn, ever since I was a toddler

(Hook)
Well I'mma quit this crazy dream
Cause when I hit the stage all the ladies scream
And when I pass by they all waving at me
But I be getting tired y'all, pray for me

(Hook)

Oh yeah, you say it could be worse?
Oh here, step into my shoes
Put yourself in my shirt!
I'm only human y'all so we all gotta work
But sometimes I wonder why I even came to this Earth
I'mma

(Hook)

Sometimes I just feel hopeless
Pacin' back and forth, man I can't even focus
That's why I'm always smokin' in the booth recordin'
As my mind races
Like Jeff Gordon
I'mma

(Hook)

It ain't supposed to be so hard
I always said I'd quit if it felt like a job
I'd rather be pissed than pretend that I'm not
And try to play along with the whole facade
I wanna:
(Hook)

It ain't a question to me
Look at me, I know what I'm destined to be
This is spiritual y'all, I'm wrestlin' beasts
But pretty soon, I'll be restin' in peace
I'mma

(Hook)

Come on, y'all actin' like I can't feel you
I can look in your eyes and tell you what you done been through
And I could give a fuck because I got bigger issues
So at this point in my life
How can I get through?

(Hook)

Look
A lot of haters attack but
It's my job to speak the truth on the track
So say what you like, you just givin' me gas
Cause by now, I got enough to drive to Venus and back
So I'mma:

(Hook)
Fuck the money I'm leavin'
I'm goin' back home after I break even
I said what I said so as long as I'm speakin'
B.o.B got the upper hand as long as I'm breathin'

[Part 2 - Wiz Khalifa]
(Intro)
Yeah
It’s Young Khalifa man
They don’t want none
They don’t none

(Hook)

Uh, How can I not
Give these niggas the game, when game’s all I got
The car of your dreams, we push it off the lot
Besides smoking the most expensive pot
Baby, I’m trynna…

(Hook)

Well, not quitting
I bought my niggas Bob
We like Jordan and Scott Pippen
Try to tell ‘em before for some reason or another
They would not listen
Tell the driver, we smoking raise the partition

(Hook)

Meet a lot of bad women
Smoke joints with ‘em, take ‘em all swimming
Shop, drink liquor until we fall
Some would say it’s wrong, that's what I call living
And them groupies ain't afraid to get in the car with ‘em
Leaving there man and get high as my credit card limit
Fuck 'em all, I’m trynna

(Hook)

That's real shit

(Hook)
Weed jars, muscle car garage
Charge it to the game
No signature being forged
The boss of my own shit, I’m in charge
Only one goal, live life, live large, yeah
Playing my part, Larry Johnson
Now a round of applause for what I’ve accomplished

Fucking awesome

[Verse 1]
All Nas need is one mic, all I need is one stove
Homie got a nice flow but gucci got that white coke
You ain't getting the right dope, you knocking on the wrong door
Last nigga tried me, let's just call him John Doe
And since you short a dime homie then park me a old school
I fronted you, you ran off that's not what you're supposed to do
I'm gettin my tip fade cut Bouldercrest and Flat Shoals
Wish a nigga would run up on me like I'm Brisco
Yeah, Gucci mane's a live wire
Try me like I'm Yung Berg and I'mma make yo eyes cry
Gucci like to drank, and Gucci like to smoke
And Gucci on the rise while you niggas going broke
GUCCI! (Gucci Mane's a G')
Tell me something I don't know
I got court in early morning I don't really wanna go
I do this for the people cause I'm my brother's keeper
I don't feel you cause I'm paraplegic, where's my paralegal

[Hook]
See that house right there, yeah make a lot a money
(Who's that knocking at the door?)
Probably a couple junkies
That coupe over there, yeah cost a couple hundreds
See my neighborhood is bunkin tell my plug to keep it coming
Dope boys, dope boys with the dope boss (x2)
What you wanna get homie hurry up and buy it
Dopeboys gone buy you gon' get yourself supply

[Verse 2]
I'm in my M6 Beemer, this is no 645
Like a pigeon in the sky, I just shitted on your ride
So much weight off in my house, you would think it was a gym
Plus my Nikes match my necklace and my necklace match my rims
I got court in early morning I don't really wanna go
Say I violated probation just because I blew my nose
Blew 300 on my Rolls
200 more on the Lamb
Million dollars on the crib
Car note, don't know what that is
Gucci, you don't know who that is
Mama that's just Gucci Mane, that's my boy that's my partner
I'm Gucci Mane biggest fan
Plus she don't know what that is
I'm with that I don't give a damn
If you think I give a fuck you must do not know who I am, Gucci

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Mirror mirror mirror
Who the realest in the game?
(Why you ask that stupid question
Boy you know that's Gucci Mane)
East Atlanta 6
You know how we roll
I just bought another Chevy got it right back out the bowl
Tall stacks up in my closet I can't even see my clothes
And my belly get so big I can hardly see my toes
Got a car in my garage I have never ever drove
It's a four-door black on black Phantom I call that bitch Dorrough
If she going to the ladies room I guess I'll let her know
I got powder in my living room, so she don't have to stroll
A year ago today, I was sitting in my cell
(Where you see yourself in 5 years?)
A so icey billionare
Gucci!

[Hook]
(Intro)
Yeah man
It's your boy
Young Khalifa man
Wiz Khalifa
Whatever the fuck you wanna call me
And uh, its '09, Star Year, yeah
So we gon' do this like this
Taylor Gang
Heavy hustle and all that
Uh um

[Verse 1:]
New money, new car, new crib
And you gon' need luggage cause this nigga's a trip
Meet the buyer, frequent flyer
Loose chains with it, need some pliers, get a grip
And me I'm who the supplier's sitting with
Got a blunt rolled
Keep me a dime with sitting bitch
I'm Mr. Space, sign niggas like Elroy
And my bills big faced like Hellboy
They say I'm guaranteed to blow young steroid
And I get it gone, my new home is the airport
Wake up in a new city and state
Party all night, then go to sleep on a plane
Yeah
And it's mill to ice grills
Saying all you wants a picture
But nigga I'm trynna chill
Lot of speculation since a nigga signed a deal
But for all y'all that hold me down for real
I wanna thank ya

[Hook - Jackson 5 Sample]
Thank you baby (You, you, and you)
Thank you baby, I'm back where I belong (I feel great man)
It's great to be here, great to be here
(You ain't even gotta ask man it's written all over my face)
It's great to be here in your arms
Back where I belong

(Yeeah Baby)

[Verse 2:]
I ain't make your front page or your top ten
I'm not a hipster plus I heard rocks in
First Flight on the way, but 'til it drops then
I'm peroxide in the cut, getting it popping
A new year, got a couple shows locked in
Couple of important folks doing some talking
I'm with the stars and niggas who go hard
Getting chavo
Niggas duckin' from rosado
Checking battery life now, charging my iPhone
I do it big, you just the shit in your time zone
I switch those like clothes
Charm like a computer with a virus cause mine's froze
Whoa
I get a whole lot of whole hate, whole lot of hoes
Spend a whole lot of cake on them Prada clothes
When you mention my name, they ain't gotta know
This for thinking they oughta know
I wanna thank ya

[Hook]

[Intro]
And I present to you
To you all
The Odd Future compilation
The fuck? Give it up
Starring
Casey V, Hodgy Beats, Left Brain, Super 3, and Tyler, the Creator
Give it up! Give it up for ‘em!
Will y'all shut the fuck up?
Damn, I’m here
Alright, let me configure this
Get this ready
Alright, let’s go

[Verse]
Nigga seventeen his own fucking magazine
And of course, his Hunger Force is Aqua Teen by all means
Fuck a deal, signature is legible
I'm the reason why niggas is heatin' up they vegetables
From being bullied in the sixth, to being dissed by any bitch
That can breath, please throw me in a ditch
And I hope I sell a copy of this disk
Fuck Hope, I am one short, a miracle of wish
Whether you nigga or ese, the magazine is great
Because the articles an essay
Half you dumb niggas can't even write an essay
Cause all of ya'll some stupid asses, S.A
You motherfuckers in denial
I'm the square just like the tile, right down the fucking isle
Music was my only friend, ever since I was a child
I make niggas frown, just to give myself a smile
Mother was my father, the nigga didn't bother
To send a kid a dollar, my only role model was
Niggas that record and that could play keyboards
And wild piano chords make me happy
Dr. Suess more important than Jesus
Y'all immigrants to depression, nigga give me a visa
We sick, the same lames that sneeze us
Made us turn to Jazz now, because the black kids would tease us
I need a fucking chain, I need to make it rain
I need some fucking rims, a car that I can rent
A verse about swag, jeans sagging off my ass
No I don't, fuck that, I am not a fucking fag
I rhyme and I'm still scared of guns
In the marching band but I bang my own drums and
Sing my own song, all of my wrongs are right
Never got into a fight, hit me
Bass, drum, snare, let it go
Disappear like good music in the past year
And everybody do the same thing, I hear the same shit
All the time, like the radio is queer
This isn't a mixtape, it's more of ear rape
By kids who think you other niggas suck
It's very offensive, you niggas defensive
If you can't take the heat then get the fuck out the kitchen, listen

[Outro]
Tyler the Creator, Hodgy Beats, Super 3, Casey V, Left Brain
Enjoy the show, good night, thank you, and fuck you

See the same things twice, nothing like me though
Man they can dream, flow like a whole kilo
Now I got your bitch, try and find me like nemo
Spend a lot of cash, can’t front I might leave broke
One life to live, 800 on the weed smoke
Stacks for them Guccis like, fuck it im'a need those
Young superstar, but were feelin like heroes
Top down, and im flying like an eagle
Tats on my neck, face, hands like a cholo
All about my Green, bout my Green like Gino
Stars in my face, no scars no Cino
Smile hard, (hard) swag real mean though
Paid enough for it, show my ass with my jeans low
Started from the bottom, now made it like zero
/got it on lockdown, feeling like nino

[Hook]
Yeah they talk but I can't hear what they say
Cause I'm flyin sware they see me but I'm too many miles away

[Verse 2]
Now I'm in florida yeah they know me there too
Walkin with jewels out showin all my tattoos
Can't say my name right but they know I'm that dude
Walk 54 place niggas eatin fast food
Brother out in Lauderdale cousin down in FAMU
So that means I got a plug good drugs when I land too

You don't talk money that's why I can't understand you
See I'm hot now going for a grammy though
Think this bitch bad you should see my Miami ho
Down in south beach met her at the Cameo
Told her what my life like took her to the Sagamore

Never buyin dubs, whole zips what I gotta blow
Always dressed to impress you can tell
She love my cologne that's money that you smell yeah!

[Hook]
Yeah they talk but I can't hear what they say
Cause I'm flyin sware they see me but I'm too many miles away

Come on, baby—like you don't know the streets is (uh)
Too bad they'll find yo body but in pieces (uh), cuz the beast is
On some real cruddy shit, about to split yo wig with some bloody shit

Bite yo hand like I tried yo man, cause what u saying is nothing (uh huh)
Must really think I'm playing, but I'll be laying while you bluffing
Look out, they don't let that crook out I took out
Enough of yo family to have a fucking cookout (uh)
For one time we get together (uh) is it when everyone get hit together
Or when I'm in the tan just before they hit the lever
I'm a say it so I know how much strength is left
And curse all who will breathe in the stench of death (uh huh)
Though after the sixth day I'm buried, I will rise
Embalming fluid in my veins and blood in my eyes (uh, uh)
And them guys that was laughing, don't even smile anymore
How many 4 pound rounds can yo ass endure?
20 more of that raw strip to the flesh (what?!)
1000 pounds of pressure, shit that rip through the vest and pull yo chest open
So what the Ruff Ryder posed to do when you fronting?
Give u niggas what u wanting, mufucka...nothing!!

[Tyler]
Litter fuckin' life, and I hit bitches and they fuckin' wife
Chris brown a real nigga, sock that bitch up in her mouth
Do I give a fuck? No, but if I gave a fuck
Do you think I'd tell you? Fuck no! Kinda like my dad
When he came home and told me he wanted to get my ass wet
Goddamn that's gay but I'm not so fuck it I won't stop
I keep sayin' this gay shit
But if you got a problem nigga, you don't gotta play it
I need my damn inhaler cause I'm barely fuckin' breathing
Jackin' off semen everywhere up on the chair
I put my jeans but fuck it I'll just go to Diamond and get another pair
And if they got a problem, fuck it, go to 'preme and get a box logo fuckin' tee
And motherfuckin' panties just to match, so when I can pee
I can pull them fuckin' down and sit down and look at E
Fuckin' rectangles on my fuckin' G-string
That's fuckin' gay I know, goddamn that shit is tight but yo

[Hodgy Beats]

And fat kids that eat donuts and act like sluts, fuck y'all little bitch ass niggas

[Tyler]
I don't know I'm bored, so I'mma rap about shit
That don't need to be rapped about shit
I get bitches and I'm I wrap 'em in shit like plastic wrap and shit
And then there at the bottom of my freezer with the carrots and
Broccoli, ain't no fuckin' stopping me
I'm hotter then the dandazies
On my fuckin' penis when Raquel was on her fuckin' knees
But she don't like to talk to me
She fuckin' up cause in about a week we gon' have like 30 G's
Coulda bought her, a fuckin', Gucci purse
(You know what I was gonna say first)
I don't care I got bitch lickin' my balls
And I'mma take all my homies and roll through the mall
Buy every fuckin' thing and listen to Tina
While we buy everything and listen to Tina
While we buy everything and listen to Tina
While we listen to Tina, I'mma buy everything
And give way to fuckin' bums..
My lungs ain't got no fuckin' air
So if I fuckin' stop here, there
I don't care if you do but if you do I don't care
That's not makin' sense, I'm a fuckin' ithiet
And I'm so fuckin' intimate
With a fuckin' pastor tryna fuck me in his class
While there's cum up on my ass
So when I slide I can just motherfuckin', um, move faster
Goddamn that's nasty
Oh shit, jackin' off then I watch Degrassi
And watch a bunch of pedophiles come on and pass me
My fuckin' beard is growin' in so they are losing interest
So let me shave it, so they can try and get into this
Damn that's gay as fuck

[Hodgy Beats]
Yo
The infamous nigga is wilding, whole fuckin' crew is dieting
So we go to Trae and goons and get some rice pudding
For all these bitches that don't want the beef
Be cool so we keep pushing and uh, niggas know we flowing
If we ain't, then we ain't flowing

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I’ma chase my dream
Coming to America like Prince Akeem
I ain't never give a fuck but then I seen
High definition to get what's forever given
But nothing was never given, I build it from ground up
I started out with my basement and builded my house up
I’m rich off opportunity, money gon’ pile up
My swag on a hundred mil', how the stylist gon' style us?
Caught up in the light, caught up in the life
I see youngin on the corner with a quarter of that white
He just tryna chase his dream plus his daughter needs some wipes
And some Pampers so he don’t give a fuck about the slammer
He just tryna stay alive, clutching on his hammer
World full of problems, ain't nobody gotta answer
Mommy in the grave, daddy gettin’ high
Bills steady rollin’ in, he barely gettin’ by
Same clothes everyday, he barely gettin’ fly
Er'yday he wake, he just swear to do his job
What that is? Chasin’ dreams, time is tickin’ so it seems
On his downtime he’s spittin’ and he’s sick, his flow is mean
He just want his real chance, no reality show
But the graveyard the jail cell, reality though
Crack house was his crib, the streets fathered him though
And he ain't got no Twitter page but you can follow him though
Woah

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Dream chaser, keep chasin'
Grind will turn into your shine, be patient
Yeah, hundred miles and runnin'
Tryna catch up to my dreams so you know I'm Forrest Gumpin'
I'm a dream chaser, dream chaser, dream chaser
Dream chaser, dream chaser, dream chaser
Dream chaser, dream chaser

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
Uh, I was raised by my momma, pop used to beat her
Got a sister my age, my pop was a cheater
Gram's kept something in the pot for us to eat up
Had to open up the oven for the house to heat up
Christmas missed us, no birthdays or Easters
Used to snatch bags from Halloween trick or treaters
Hot dogs and beans, fish sticks on the weekend
Shared the same bed that my cousin used to pee in (ill)
Dreamed to be the Huxtables, settled for the Bradys
Black and white on top of floor model with no cable (uh)
My sister used to punch me, beat me, slap me
Caught my first case stealin' cookies outta ACME (man)
Raised in South Phil', 2-4 where you can find me at
Used to kick the machines for quarters out the laundromat
Dirty little teen, going to school embarrassin'
Gas cut off, my clothes smelling like kerosene

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Dream chaser, keep chasin'
Grind will turn into your shine, be patient
Yeah, hundred miles and runnin'
Tryna catch up to my dreams so you know I'm Forrest Gumpin'
I'm a dream chaser, dream chaser, dream chaser
Dream chaser, dream chaser, dream chaser
Dream chaser, dream chaser

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
It all started in the basement, me, my pen and my pad
Started thinkin’ bout things I never had
Was broke as a joke, ain't never laugh
I woke up and went and got it, and now they forever mad
How can you hate me where I came from?
When just a year ago I was the same one
Them dudes you call your homies be the main one
You'd be surprised what niggas do as soon as the fame come
But I ain't worried, discouraged, I just observe it
When my dreams started to crumble, niggas deserted
Empty courtroom when my judge read my verdict
But now I'm gettin' to it, niggas act like they deserve it
Sittin' in my cell, watching my dream
Fade like Mike, fourth quarter, tie game
Shackles on my ankles and wrist, my first chains
And now it’s hard work on the menu, I thirst cream, I'm a

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Dream chaser, keep chasin'
Grind will turn into your shine, be patient
Yeah, hundred miles and runnin'
Tryna catch up to my dreams so you know I'm Forrest Gumpin'
I'm a dream chaser, dream chaser, dream chaser
Dream chaser, dream chaser, dream chaser
Dream chaser, dream chaser

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
Can't panic, don't panic
They knocking, don't panic
It's them people in penny-loafers
They searching people and searching sofas
Oh lord, can't panic, don't panic
No time to plot it, no time to plan it
100 keys up in the attic, 100 keys up in the attic
Oh lord

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
30 racks of Diesel, watching for them people
2 birds in the kitchen; 1 brick, 1 desert Eagle
If the cops rush in, better flush it
Better pray to God they don't see you
Cause them F-E-D-S Boys want to L-I-F-and E you
So don't panic, don't panic, if they grab you
Don't panic, nigga dropping statements on the
Whole hood, they grabbed the nigga and he ramming
Got them young boys like 30 years still walking around
And he standing, bet that would've been one of my niggas
Bet you homie would've died quicker
My lawyer cost 100 thou', nigga, rats telling with no remorse
Shoot at us, no reports, we shoot at them they going to court
Fuck niggas want to go to war, just make sure you could stand it
And when them boys start rushing, nigga, just don't panic

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
Can't panic, don't panic
They knocking, don't panic
It's them people in penny-loafers
They searching people and searching sofas
Oh lord, can't panic, don't panic
No time to plot it, no time to plan it
100 keys up in the attic, 100 keys up in the attic
Oh lord

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Pussy niggas panic, I could see they panties
Rain, snow, or sleet, I'm in these streets
And it's so organic, WB but no Atlantic
Play with me and I bet I'll handle it, 30 G's, 20 shows a month
That's too much to count and too much to manage
I'm on my dope boy shit, yeah my car's white
Motherfuck a hater, I done lived a hard life
I'm swanging out my building, trying to raise my children
Top got no ceiling, Yo Gotti
Nigga Meek Milly, counted my first million
That's when my whole life changed, I pledge allegiance to the streets
That I'll never panic if them FEDS came
That's on everything, money, bag and the bread game
My partner and them is my partner and them
Murder one or get guap with them, I'm Yo Gotti

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
Can't panic, don't panic
They knocking, don't panic
It's them people in penny-loafers
They searching people and searching sofas
Oh lord, can't panic, don't panic
No time to plot it, no time to plan it
100 keys up in the attic, 100 keys up in the attic
Oh lord

[Hook]

You know the residence

And I can understand why niggas sayin Dom is next

Wait till a nigga blow up, watch who you peep me with
I only want her for tonight man you can keep this bitch
Peep this shit I got my 20's

If you want to be King then I suggest you vote for Bun
A real nigga know, when a real nigga's done
If you want to be a King then I suggest you vote for Bun
Like that

[Intro]
I, I see you with your palms in your pants
But me, me, oh me, I got the world in my hands
I make it spin on my finger, I'm a critical thinker
I'm a hell of a smoker, and a bit of a drinker, yeah!

[Chorus]
I, I see you with your palms in your pants
But me, me, see me, I got the world in my hands
I make it spin on my finger (yeah) I'm a critical thinker (yeah)
I'm a hell of a smoker, and a bit of a drinker

[Post-Chorus]
I know your name, yeah
Your name is unimportant, yeah (haha!)
We in the belly of the beast, yeah
And she thinking 'bout abortion, damn

[Verse 1]
Uhh, I woke up this morning, dick rock hard
Ashed my blunt in my Grammy Award
You can save your bullshit on your memory card
If this real nigga business, then you niggas unemployed
Jumped on the celly, called Makaveli
He say he was gravy, I say I was jelly
Looked in the mirror, said "You's an ill nigga"
Then I ran to the money like track and field nigga
Now I think I'll have me a coffee with six sugars
In a world full of ass-kissers and dick pullers
I'm tryna walk a straight line but the line crooked
I'm shooting for the stars, astronauts dodge bullets
Yeah, I bought a brand new attitude
The hate is music to my ears, I got my dancin' shoes
Sometimes we question shit that there is no answer to
But I just built a house on I Don't Give a Fuck Avenue

[Chorus]
I, I see you with your palms in your pants (haha!)
But me, me, see me, I got the world in my hands
I make it spin on my finger (yeah) I'm a critical thinker (yeah)
I'm a hell of a smoker (yeah) and a bit of a drinker (hey!)

[Post-Chorus]
I know your name, yeah
Your name is unimportant, yeah
We in the belly of the beast, yeah
And she thinking 'bout abortion, damn

[Verse 2]
Uhh, down on the ceiling, looking up at the bed
Life is a gamble, better check the point spread
And when life sucks, I just enjoy the head
I'm so sick of these niggas, I need meds
Uh, smoking on that hallelujah, thank you Jesus
Help me focus on the future and not the previous
Double R, I'm a rebel with a reason
Sometimes you gotta fight the devil with a demon
Blood is in the streets and it is up to my knees
Underground shit, I see myself as a seed
Living in the glass, and everybody's looking
But how can you get the picture if you don't know who took it?
This current affairs, but who the hell cares?
Everybody's fighting over positions, musical chairs
On the road to redemption, you gonna use a few spares
I'm just fucking ready so I come prepared

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah I know your name (hey!) yeah
Your name is unimportant, yeah (listen mayne)
We in the belly of the beast, yeah
And she thinking 'bout abortion, damn

[Bridge]
And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air
Life is a rollercoaster, but still unfair
A blessing in disguise is right before our eyes
But since it is in disguise, we don't know that it's there

[Chorus]
And I, see you with your palms in your pants
But me, me, see me, I got the world in my hands
I make it spin on my finger, I'm a critical thinker
I'm a hell of a smoker, and a bit of a drinker
I know your name...
As it is, shawty

[Produced by A$AP Ty Beats]

[Verse 1]
I be that pretty mothafucka, Harlem's what I'm reppin'
Tell my niggas quit the bitchin', we gon' make it in a second
Never disrespected plus I'm well connected
With this coke that I imported, just important as your President
Swagger so impressive and I don't need a necklace
But these bitches get impressed when you pull up in that 7
Them 6's, them Benzes, I gets get the freshest
Raf Simons, Rick Owens usually what I'm dressed in
Blowing blunts rolling doobies up, smoking sections
Groupies rush hold they boobies up, in my direction
Quit with all the fronting, you ain't 'round my clique for nothing
'Cause our presence is a present, just to kick it is a blessing

[Chorus]
This is the way it goes, this is the way we roll
'Cause every day we on our pesos (Pesos)
This is the way it goes, this is the way we roll
'Cause every day we on our pesos (Pesos)
(Gun cock, gunshot, gun a likkle bwoy)
(Gun cock, gunshot, gun a likkle bwoy)
(Gun cock, gunshot, gun a likkle bwoy)
'Cause every day we on our pesos

[Verse 2]
Yo, yo, yo, your bitch just said I'm hot, man, I told her I agree
She gon' really think I'm hot if I told her my degrees
Pull up in that hard-top, showing off my keys
Graduate school of hard-knocks, I can show you my degrees
Couple A, B, C's, bad bitch, double D's
Popping E, I don't give a F, told you I'm a G
A.S.A.P., Stevie got it on his sleeve
But I got it on my chest, my nigga, this is what I breathe
Inhale, exhale, cocaine, X pills
Import, export, Harlem catching rec still
So mami, show me how that neck feel (Feel)
Later show me how the rest feel, for now just chill

[Chorus]
This is the way it goes, this is the way we roll
'Cause every day we on our pesos
This is the way it goes, this is the way we roll
'Cause every day we on our pesos
(Gun cock, gunshot, gun a likkle bwoy)
(Gun cock, gunshot, gun a likkle bwoy)
(Gun cock, gunshot, gun a likkle bwoy)
'Cause every day we on our pesos
'Cause every day we on our pesos
'Cause every day we on our pesos

[Intro]
Like a circus freak
Hahaha, alright
Where that beat go?
Okay, leggo (Ow!)

[Verse]
Look, gon' make ‘em clap, make 'em do that
And when this nigga rap, they be like, “Who that?”
She in the party super wet, where the pool at?
I got a big head, so my hat adjust to two snaps
Money to the ceilin', tell me where my roof at
Your pants too tight, maybe you just too fat
Just a Cheetoh with Doritos, yeah, I lay 'em like du-rags
Boy, I know why you mad, 'cause my chain stupid
And your girl leanin' all on me
I'ma give her a couple of drinks, and then I put her ass to sleep, haha
Bedtime, if she cums, she a freak
Then you read them headlines that she fuckin' with CB, ha!
What you mean? I'ma ball out
I'm drivin' space ships, I threw my cars out
What I call a garage, you call a house
Live in that hole in the wall, you are a mouse
They be like, "Chris, you killin' it, soprano"
Valet tryna steal my keys, nigga, this ain't no piano
What you mean? I'm the president, give a fuck about a panel
They gon' have to change the channel 'cause this boy too much to handle, yup
Haha, all that bullshit, I ain't hearin' it
'Cause I'm on point like a pyramid
And I'm flushin' you turds, killin' shit
Only hear two words, nigga sick
Yeah, I'm the B-E-S-T-E-S-T
I'm in that Range, you in that low-key
Off that super loud, the car smokin'
But it's Friday, what up, Smokey?
Damn, man, all these cameras are bananas
And the waitress hate me, hope she don't spit in my sandwich, ugh!
Yeah, y'all can't get at me like a mention
Indirectly, y'all respect me 'cause this boy in detention, ah!
But still I walk around too proud
Neighbors mad at me 'cause I fuck too loud
You would think I was police, how I move crowds
Neighbours mad at me, 'cause I fuck too loud
V.A.-gina, two up, two down
Team Breezy, yeah I'm reppin' it
We the shit, boy, so don't step in it
I'm all about my stripes like a veteran
And it's gettin' too late, I need to take my medicine
Okay, okay, let me go
Nigga be shinin', oh, Soul Glow
Boy, look at all these diamonds
And my chain so heavy that my neck be whinin'
Can't see you, all I see is my shades
Girl, got her giddy giddy, Frankie Lymon
I make her cum like clockwork
What you call that? Perfect timin'
They call me Hercules, just like a slave, she workin' me
Know she off that Bonnie, when she smokin', it got them purple leaves
7-Eleven head, no hands when she slurpin' me
Then she swallowed my sword like a circus freak
Hey there Bret I see you lookin' down, don't wanna see my little buddy down with a frown
Just because I get more women than you, well that's only because they don't know you like I do
Sure you're weedy, and kinda shy but some girly out there must be needy for a weedy shy guy
They want you as their needle when they're rolling in the hay
Just hear me out when I say

Bret you got it going ohh-n, the ladies'll get to know your sexuality
When they get to know your personality
I said Bret you got it going ohh-n
Not in a gay way, just in a 'hey man I wanted to say that you're looking okay man'
Why can't a heterosexual guy tell a heterosexual guy that he thinks his booty is fly
Not all the time obviously just when hes got a problem with his self-esteem
Don't let anybody tell you you're not humpable, because you're bumpable
Well I hope this doesnt make you feel uncomfortable
If I say 'you got a boom, ow-ow come on Bret' help me out now

Bret you got it going ohh-n (i got it going ohh-n)
That's the conclusion that I've come to, but that doesn't mean that I want to bum you
Bret you got it going ohh-n (i got it going on)
No doubt about it we'd be getting crazy if one of us was lucky enough to be born a lady
OH if one of us was a lady, and I was your man, if I was your man
Well sometimes it gets lonely
And I nee-eed a woman
And then I imagine you with some bosoms
In fact, one time when we were touring and I was really lonely
And we were sharing that twin room in the hotel, I put a wig on you while you were sleeping
I put a wig on you, oooh ooh ooh and I just lay there and spooned you
Oh Bret you got it going on
"One big room full of bad bitches"

If it's a cutie with a booty
It be Gucci Louis Prada
If he doubt her, it don't matter, I'mma beat her like a father
Gucci Gucci Gucci oochie wally oh my gaga
Sit-sitting pretty let me treat him like a bye bye

Big ass room full of bad bitches
I mean one big room full of big ass bitches
Pretty in the face, but some thick ass bitches
With the pussy in their face and they lick ass bitches
Once you got the banger and you standing in the doorway
.44 play for a trick ass nigga
He'll pop that monster, god, right up in this hallway
Leave this muthafucka looking something like Norway
Apologize, never know what I'm gonna say
I sympathize, but I'm so desensitized
When some real shit happen I just put it in a rhyme
And you only making shit happen after dinner time
Nigga I'm puttin on, they say that's Virginia time
And every time she give me dome, I say I'm in her mind
Big money making hoes so you all seem ?
Then I let my sons run in somebody's daughter
I'm in..
"One big room full of bad bitches"

If it's a cutie with a booty
It be Gucci Louis Prada
If he doubt her, it don't matter, I'mma beat her like a father
Gucci Gucci Gucci oochie walie oh my gaga
Sit-sitting pretty let me treat him like a bye bye

One big room kicking it: kung fu
You niggas ain't here cause you niggas uncool
She gave a nigga face so I made her cum too
She made a nigga late, but I never cum soon
? keep the fingers so tense
Last time I made it rain, man, I left them hoes drenched
You niggas ain't in the game, man
You niggas on the bench
You make my celly rang if you really wanna hit
Bet he mentioned Trey's name if he looking for his bitch
Some people on the road ask how it come to me
I told em that the flow actually runs through me
Revealed this is real as a real dude who's filming the movies
Then they ask about the money and the groupies I go dummy
I go groupie, I throw hoes in the jacuzzi
That coochie super-juice, I love you like I love Lucy
And you beef ? never knew me
Up in..

[Domo Genesis]
It's Mr. Smoke-A-Lot-Of-Pot
Bathing Ape accessories, I'm wearing camouflage a lot
I'm a fucking soldier, thought I told you we'd be on the top
Slow grind on and off the clock
Give me a sec, I'll get a model bitch to swallow cock
Got these white girls everywhere screaming "Domo rocks!"
Put it down beautiful, 360 Tomahawks
Every nigga say he sick, I think it's just a kind of cough
That shit give me a headache and ripping beats is my Tylenol
Making massacres of every single beat I'm rhyming on
Bitch, I been raw since I popped out them vagina walls
Better cuff that bitch, cause I'll break your baby mama off
Drink the last hit of Kool Aid like "nigga, I'm the boss"
Bitch I'm getting paid, fuck whoever told me not to floss
Was struggling for a minute, my shit is just finally poppin off
Swag on 100, bitches on my fucking cock and balls
I tell em "hang out" cause I ain't really got time to stall
Bitches give me numbers but I don't really have the time to call
I'm focused on this money, give me everything
I want it all. I'm what goes up:
If I get higher then I'll never fall
Whole Gang run this shit, I guess it's like a marathon
Super Skywalker, it's apparent that I'm very gone
Young but I'm not playing with these niggas like Eddie Long
Feels like I'm really getting better after every song
So I'mma have to keep dropping this shit until I'm on the throne
Swear I be doing everything that's in my fucking songs
Keep it real G, and I put that on my fucking bong
Been a while since my first, you've been sleeping for too fucking long
Said we'll fall off, but boy were you fucking wrong
So let me set it straight: winning is my fucking fate
Grab a bottle, celebrate. Roll that bomb and detonate
Insta-classic every track, every time I defecate
Homicide: add another line to my resume

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Uh the club lite turn to sunrise
You know I still ain't done right
Skip my place and take you to yo crib
Im trynna roll a mega joint, raid yo fridge
You got the ps3 you love yo kid
Ima play his shit since he not here
And I still got a fetish for other niggas hoes
Still keep the tooth brush in my car
With some basketball shorts and a charger for my phone
You never know what will happen, spontaneous action
In the city of the Mardi Gras parades and gun clappin, quarterbacking
Not the center but I'm snapping bongs
Shorty don't be smoking like that she grown
Leon Phelps, Hugh Hef grotto flow
Boogie nights at the roxbury, Which way should we go huh?

[Hook: Curren$y]
6 in the morn'
But I don't wanna go home
So im driving from the club alone
Hoping one of these hoes answer they phones
(Got these bitches slippin' of they wedding rings)
(Its the planes and the gang)

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah, 6 am chicks we slay them
Knowing favorite songs picks we play them
I ain't on some oh I'm just some big star shit, but tell you I sure afford it
My lifestyle, all the visuals are gorgeous
Spend nights out couple bitches at the fortress
Got all these lil hoes addicted, cause if it ain't broke then its rich bitch
I'm ridin' in my ride getting lifted
Thinkin' which chick I'ma Bruce Lee kick with
I roll another joint then start my mission
And hella watch her watch my prevision
Need a nigga that don't care what it cost him
Say you scared of heights but admit the view is awesome
And the weathers great, roll another plane, celebrate
And I'm in the sky so she ask me how I'm fly

[Hook]

Ima beat it like a father
Gucci Gucci Gucci oochie wally oh my gaga
Titties sitting pretty let me treat em like a ba-ba

Big ass room full of bad bitches
I mean one big room
Full of big ass bitches
Pretty in the face
But some thick ass bitches
With the pussy in their face
And they lick ass bitches
Once you got the banger
And you standing in the doorway
.44 play
For a trick ass nigga
He'll pop that muh fugga off
Right up in this hallway
Leave this muh fugga looking something like Norway
Apologize
Never know what im gonna say
I sympathize
But im so desensitized
When some real shit happen
I just put it in a rhyme
And you only making shit happen after dinner time
Trigga

They say that's Virginia time
And every time she give me dome
I say I'm in her mind
Big money making hoes so you all seem shorter
Sonin Niggas
Then I let my sons run in somebody's daughter

[Hook]

"One big room full of bad bitches"

If it's a cutie with a booty

Ima beat it like a father
Gucci Gucci Gucci oochie walie oh my gaga
Titties sitting pretty let me treat em like a ba-ba

One big room kicking it
Kung fu
You niggas ain't here cause you niggas uncool
She gave a nigga face
So I made her cum too
She made a nigga late
But I never cum soon
Paper Lover Keep my paper touchin
Fingers so tense
Last time I made it rain, man
I left them hoes drenched
You niggas ain't in the game, man
You niggas on the bench
You make my celly rang if you really wanna hit
Bet he mentioned Trigga's name if he looking for his bitch
Some people on the road ask how it come to me
I told em that the flow actually runs through me
Reveal this is real as a real dude who filming movies
Then they ask about the money and the groupies
I go dummy
I go goofy
I throw hoes in the jacuzzi
That coochie super-juice
I love you like I love Lucy
And you people never KNEW ME
If You sayin this the NEW ME

[Hook]
"One Big Room Full Of Bad Bitches"

Titties sitting pretty let me treat em like a ba-ba

[Hook: Johnny Julianno]
Who am I, I'm doing mine
Gave me the chance; I won't letcha go
I wanna be more than just sexual
But every time I'm so gone
Gone -on -on , soo gone
Cause you gone, it's forever now

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Young Mula Baby
I'm a blood, I'm a pro, I'm a G
In a different world, outerspace with a freak
But that don't mean Neptune on the beat
Cause its Nu Jerzey Devil from Black Wall Street
Weezy F baby from Young Money baby
Like the Easter bunny, baby wanted my candy
So I gave her my lollipop then she made her body pop
Then that made me kinda hot
I'm lying that made me sauna hot
But please stop sweatin on me, women scream "get in me"
And what do I do I get in 'em , I put on my boots and I step in 'em
Right left in em Mr. Excedrin
Head all the time, it may sound crazy but I got head on my mind
Lay it on the line or just lay on young Carter!
And yeah I hear you screaming but my name ain't harder!
Girl I'm nasty I do my thing and have you calling for me like Lassie

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Nu Jersey Devil]
I'mma flirt man I really don't care
I tell the women whatever they wann hear
Mommy I'm balling I'm so sincere
Is that your home girl sitting right there
She can be my monday
You can be my tuesday
After shorty done I can squeeze ya'll in today
Three is not a crowd I don't care what you say
My women come in twos like shoes with a cute face!
My girl gotta girlfriend, her girl gotta girlfriend
Bring her to the crib I'm a show you how I work it
Little man in the boat here come the serpeants
Slide your body down the pole and let me see you twerk it
I'm with my thursday junk she a real freak
A hundred grand fitting right up in her butt cheek
Mrs friday go easy cause she just learnin
But saturday be having mr devil's toes curlin

[Hook]

[Chorus: All Star]
I won't stop until ah, I get get get a (a billion, a billion, a billion, a billion)
I won't stop until ah, I get get get a (a billion, a billion, a billion, a billion)
I won't stop until ah, I get get get a (a billion, a billion, a billion, a billion)
I won't stop until ah, I get get get a (a billion, a billion, a billion, a billion)

[Verse 1]
Hustle, I'm going to get it from the muscle
When they ask my motivation I say struggle
Cause when your dead broke them haters will start to love you
The women don't really hate you they never think nothing of you
But I'm a make 'em love me! Until the day that I die
Swag on a hundred I'm so fly I bought a place in the sky
Like the Jetsons, I'm destined to do it like the best did
If shit stink then I really think I must have stepped in a pile of it
Bullshit, I done walked a mile of it
Took a broken home and made smile of it, really though
Benjamin's and Jackson's, Grant's down to old George
On my mind like everyday, so you know I'mma go for it
Homie say he use to get it, what he got to show for it
Little bit of money from the jury that he sold for
No navigation, I'm just driving on the road for
Billion dollar life style, 'til they turn my lights down

[Chorus: All Star]
I won't stop until ah, I get get get a (a billion, a billion, a billion, a billion)
I won't stop until ah, I get get get a (a billion, a billion, a billion, a billion)
I won't stop until ah, I get get get a (a billion, a billion, a billion, a billion)
I won't stop until ah, I get get get a (a billion, a billion, a billion, a billion)

[Verse 2]
Billion dollar dreams, and hundred dollar nightmares
Success is in my arm reach, I can see it right there
I just got to grab it, but I'm stuck in traffic
Still on probation but I'm clutchin' on this 'matic
Cops catch me with it, judge gon' give me somethin' tragic
But these haters, they gon' kill me if I don't have it
Just pray for me
Money, dreams, comin' now, homie screamin' wait for me
I'm telling him, hurry up they trying to close this gate on me
Ya, get money or die
I never thought I'd see the day my dreams comin' alive
When I was locked inside a cell I had a run in with God
He told never look back, I never known him to lie, so I did it
I got with it, started grinding and shining
Had to take a sacrifice ain't have no time for the crying like let's get it
Now I got it and I'm livin' my life
They throwing shade cause I'm livin' the life, yeah!

[Chorus: All Star]
I won't stop until ah, I get get get a (a billion, a billion, a billion, a billion)
I won't stop until ah, I get get get a (a billion, a billion, a billion, a billion)
I won't stop until ah, I get get get a (a billion, a billion, a billion, a billion)
I won't stop until ah, I get get get a (a billion, a billion, a billion, a billion)

[Interlude]
Ay look, 24/7, 365
I ain't never going to sleep
I live for everything, never settle for nothing
You don't believe me check my Twitter
Check them hours on that Twitter I ain't never sleep
If they can make a hundred million, I can too
Dreamchasers, the world is yours
Leggo!

[Chorus: All Star]
I won't stop until ah, I get get get a (a billion, a billion, a billion, a billion)
I won't stop until ah, I get get get a (a billion, a billion, a billion, a billion)

I won't stop until ah, I get get get a (a billion, a billion, a billion, a billion)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Then the god stepped in
Instead of A the track should say Amen (Haha)
Drama I got it, Weezy bionic, Wayne iconic
Get up in that ass like a colonic
We don't do drive by's we do pull ups like Sonic
Don't it, remind you of greatness
Leave your ass faceless
I battle you, take your heart, and then taste it
I'm a crazy motherfucker, and so is my homies
And I promise, to make most of my moment
You boys ain't talking bout shit
Even in the bathroom you ain't talking bout shit
Shoot your ass in the leg, tell you walk it out bitch
Tommy gun on me like a Tommy outfit
I'm a, Hollygrove asshole
Bitch I'm gutta like a bad bone
Make the money do cartwheels
Footprint like a Carolina Tarheel
Just like young Mike
It's Young Money bitch we about to take flight
Weezy

[Verse 2: Smitty]
Yes, you are now rocking with the best
Evil empire, DJ EFX
Remix Mafia, 3 6, we sick, make hit records prestigious
We just, ride 'til the new budget free up
Married to this shit 10 years, no prenup
Done with the games, man put the Wii up
Meet up at the Days Inn then turn the beat up
Re-up, yea I'm trynna get a key up
Say the game locked, Wayne better get a key up
(Ugh) On the flow put the G up
Velour suit FILA, feet up 2 seater
We up in the Poconos brewing that tea up
Bet better yet ? like cheya
Cheya money long like me (yuh)
Mean sixteens that'll end your career
We are, right here mon frere
From the same label that brought you Aaliyah
Prayer, in the air one shot, one tear
Warning, these rap niggas not what they appear
Never been cheap Louis Vs on my ear
Fuck the grill rather spend 10 mil on veneers (yea)
This a hip-hop premier
Talking old school D and D like ?
And Aaliyah (yea) still on some fly shit
And tell Splash "yea homie this our shit"
The flow crack, go and get the ?
Now clip that, take it back to the projects
I obsess over trying to be the best
But if it's no struggle, then it's no progress
And that's a hard pill that I try and digest
I just kill them off soft like Wyclef
Rooms in the sky, dead men fly
These type of words make a grown man cry
(Who am I) Most hated, underrated, and debated
If we ain't talking money homie I'll see you later
Kinda faded with this thick bitch looking like Jada
Take her back to the truck, then we fuck
Then I ate her, made her nut
Got her up, now she talking 'bout payment
Baby you already know that the flow so crazy
Nothing more, nothing less
Yes, you are now rocking with the best

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Hey Joe, where you going with that gun in your hand?
Hey Joe, I said, where you going with that gun in your hand?

[Verse 2]
I'm going down to shoot my old lady
You know, I caught her messing around with another man
I'm going down to shoot my old lady
You know, I caught her messing around with another man
And that ain't too cool

[Verse 3]
Hey Joe, I heard you shot your woman down
You shot her down, now
Hey Joe, I heard you shot your old lady down
You shot her down to the ground

[Verse 4]
Yes I did, I shot her
You know, I caught her messing around, messing around town
Yes I did, I shot her
You know, I caught my old lady messing around town
And I gave her the gun, I shot her!

[Guitar Solo/Bridge]
Hey Joe, alright
Shoot her one more time, baby

[Verse 5]
Hey Joe, where you going to run to now?
Where you going to run to?
Hey Joe, I said, where you going to run to now?
Where you, where you going to go?
Well, dig it

[Verse 6]
I'm going way down south
Way down to Mexico way, alright
I'm going way down south
Way down where I can be free
There's no one going to find me

[Verse 7]
Ain't no hangman going to
He ain't gonna put a rope around me
You better believe it right now, I got to go now

[Outro]
Hey Joe, you better run on down
Goodbye everybody, ow!
Hey Joe, run on down

[Verse 1]
I swear I've been here before, there’s a war in my heart
Inside my chest is a thorn, it's been torn from the start
The picture painted is warped, the hearts aching and scarred
Music’s the band-aid I’m too afraid to take this shit off
Another drink at the bar, but I’m not drunk enough
Each shot burns less but the chest isn’t numbin' up
A voice keeps talkin’ in my head and I’ma fuck him up
Fill the gun with lead and bust until the pump shuts him up
Emos and rockers and rockers and emos
Another shot of some vodka to get myself up off of my ego
There’s a door to my conscience, I can’t unlock it or see the peephole
This angel held my baggage and then vanished like where did she go
I was beside her but I was walking by myself though
Break the silence with my cell phone it doesn’t help though
I can’t believe this is happening, sinking into depression
I’ve been here before and now I’m back again

[Hook]
I keep fallin, I keep fallin, I keep fallin, down the rain
Keeps pourin, keeps pourin, I don’t know if I can get up today
Keep fallin, I keep fallin, fallin, down the rain
Keeps pourin, keeps pourin, I don’t know if I can get up today

[Verse 2]
6 am hung over leaving my booty call watch the sunrise
Head over I-5 headed North but there’s no sign of sunshine
Empty brandy bottles spilled on the forgotten memories
Know I gotta let her go I’m just to selfish to set it free
Life forced release, two hours later I just got up and bounced
If she could only see me now head lost swallowed and drowned
The path is up but I followed it down
A man gone and hollowed out because you opened it up
You can’t start over now
What’s to keep going for?
Validated by drunken whores
Bloody knuckles so numb and sore from punching these rusty doors
Freeway signs underpasses man stranded dusty mattress
This world is bipolar, beautiful for some for others the fuckin’ saddest
So sick of lugging baggage
All I got is drugs and alcohol and these cuts of passion
Brain serenade razorblade, punk madness
Pain is love plug the drain but the rain keeps crashing like

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
There's talk on the street, it sounds so familiar
Great expectations, everybody's watching you
People you meet, they all seem to know you
Even your old friends treat you like you're something new

[Chorus]
Johnny-come-lately, the new kid in town
Everybody loves you, so don't let them down

[Verse 2]
You look in her eyes, the music begins to play
Hopeless romantics, here we go again
But after a while, you're lookin' the other way
It's those restless hearts that never mend (Oh)

[Chorus]
Johnny-come-lately, the new kid in town
Will she still love you when you're not around?

[Bridge]
There's so many things you should have told her
But night after night, you're willing to hold her, just hold her
Tears on your shoulder

[Verse 3]
There's talk on the street, it's there to remind you
Doesn't really matter which side you're on
You're walking away and they're talking behind you
They will never forget you 'til somebody new comes along

[Chorus]
Where you've been lately? There's a new kid in town
Everybody loves him, don't they?
He's holding her and you're still around

[Outro]
Oh, my, my
There's a new kid in town
Just another new kid in town
(Ooh, hoo) Everybody's talking 'bout the
(Ooh, hoo) New kid in town
(Ooh, hoo) Everybody's walking like the
(Ooh, hoo) New kid in town
There's a new kid in town
I don't want to hear it
There's a new kid in town
I don't want to hear it, ah-ooh
There's a new kid in town
There's a new kid in town
There's a new kid in town
Everybody's talking
There's a new kid in town
People started walking
There's a new kid in town
There's a new kid in town
There's a new kid in town
There's a new kid in town

[Verse 1]
He was a hard-headed man, he was brutally handsome
And she was terminally pretty
She held him up and he held her for ransom
In the heart of the cold, cold city
He had a nasty reputation as a cruel dude
They said he was ruthless, they said he was crude
They had one thing in common, they were good in bed
She'd say, "Faster, faster, the lights are turnin' red"

[Chorus]
Life in the fast lane, surely make you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane, huh

[Post-Chorus]
Are you with me so far?

[Verse 2]
Eager for action, hot for the game
The coming attraction, the drop of a name
They knew all the right people, they took all the right pills
They threw outrageous parties, they paid heavenly bills
There were lines on the mirror, lines on her face
She pretended not to notice, she was caught up in the race
Out every evening, until it was light
He was too tired to make it, she was too tired to fight about it

[Chorus]
Life in the fast lane, surely make you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane, huh
Life in the fast lane, everything all the time
Life in the fast lane, uh-huh

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Blowin' and burnin', blinded by thirst
They didn't see the stop sign, took a turn for the worst
She said, "Listen, baby, you can hear the engine ring"
"We've been up and down this highway, haven't seen a goddamn thing"
He said, "Call the doctor, I think I'm gonna crash"
"The doctor say he's comin', but you gotta pay in cash"
They went rushin' down that freeway, messed around and got lost
They didn't care, they were just dyin' to get off and it was

[Chorus]
Life in the fast lane, surely make you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane, uh-huh
Life in the fast lane, everything all the time
Life in the fast lane, uh-huh

[Outro]
Life in the fast lane
Life in the fast lane

[Verse 1]
Well, baby, there you stand
With your little head down in your hand
Oh, my God, you can't believe
It's happening again
Your baby's gone, and you're all alone
And it looks like the end

[Verse 2]
And you're back out on the street
And you're trying to remember, oh
How do you start it over?
You don't know if you can
You don't care much for a stranger's touch
But you can't hold your man

[Chorus 1]
You never thought you'd be alone
This far down the line
And I know what's been on your mind
You're afraid it's all been wasted time

[Verse 3]
The autumn leaves have got you thinking
About the first time that you fell, fell
You didn't love the boy too much
No, no, you just
Loved the boy too well
Farewell

[Verse 4]
So you live from day to day
And you dream about tomorrow, oh
And the hours go by like minutes
And the shadows come to stay
So you take a little something
To let them go away

[Chorus 2]
And I could've done so many things, baby
If I could only stop my mind
From wonderin' what I left behind
And from worryin' 'bout this wasted time

[Verse 5]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Another love has come and gone
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
And the years keep rushing on
I remember what you told me
Before you went out on your own
"Sometimes to keep it together
We've got to leave it alone"

[Chorus 3]
So you can get on with your search, baby
And I can get on with mine
And maybe someday we will find
That it wasn't really wasted time

[Verse 1]
What kind of love have you got?
You should be home, but you're not
A room full of noise and dangerous boys
Still makes you thirsty and hot

[Verse 2]
I heard about you and that man
There's just one thing I don't understand
You say he's a liar and he put out your fire
How come you still got his gun in your hand?

[Chorus]
Victim of love, I see a broken heart
You got your stories to tell
Victim of love, it's such an easy part
And you know how to play it so well

[Verse 3]
Some people never come clean
Oh, I think you know what I mean, oh
You're walkin' the wire, pain and desire
Looking for love in between

[Verse 4]
Tell me your secrets, I'll tell you mine
A-this ain't no time to be cool
And tell all your girlfriends, your been-around-the-world friends
That talk is for losers and fools

[Chorus]
Victim of love, I see a broken heart
I could be wrong, but I'm not, no, I'm not
Victim of love, we're not so far apart
Show me, what kind of love have you got?

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Victim of love, I see a broken heart
I could be wrong, but I'm not
Victim of love, we're not so far apart
What kind of love have you got?

[Outro]
Victim of love, you're just a victim of love
I could be wrong, but I'm not, no, I'm not
Victim of love, now you're a victim of love
What kind of love have you got?
What kind of love have you got?
What kind of love have you got?

[Verse 1]
Hi there, how are you? It's been a long time
Seems like we've come a long way
My, but we learn so slow
And heroes, they come and they go
And leave us behind as if we're supposed to know
Why
Why
Why do we give up our hearts to the past?
And why must we grow up so fast?

[Verse 2]
And all you wishing well fools with your fortunes
Someone should send you a rose
With love from a friend, it's nice to hear from you again
And the storybook comes to a close
Gone are the ribbons and bows
Things to remember, places to go
Pretty maids all in a row
When you're out there on your own
Where your memories can find you
Like a circle goes around
You were lost until you found out
What it all comes down to

One by one the lonely feelings come
Day by day they slowly fade away

Ooh, the look was in her eyes
You never know what might be found there
She was dancing right in time
And the moves she made so fine
Like the music that surrounds her

Should I stay or go? I really want to know
Would I lose or win if I try and love again?

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, gonna try and love again
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, I'm gonna try and love again
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, gonna try and love
Right or wrong, what's done is done
It's only moments that you borrow
But the thoughts will linger on
Of the lady and her song
When the sun comes up tomorrow
Well, it might take years
To see through all these tears
Don't let go
When you find it, you will know

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, gonna try and love again
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, gonna try and love again
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, gonna try and love again
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Sometimes lose, sometimes win
Sometimes you need a friend
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Gonna try
Gonna try
Gonna try, gonna try, gonna try, gonna try
Gonna try, gonna try, gonna try, gonna try
Gonna try, gonna try, gonna try, gonna try
Gonna try, ooh-ooh
Gonna try, gonna try, gonna try, gonna try
Gonna try, gonna try, gonna try, gonna try
Gonna try, gonna try, gonna try, gonna try
Gonna try, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
She came from Providence
One in Rhode Island
Where the old world shadows hang
Heavy in the air
She packed her hopes and dreams
Like a refugee
Just as her father came
Across the sea

[Verse 2]
She heard about a place
People were smiling
They spoke about the red man's ways
And how they loved the land
And they came from everywhere
To the Great Divide
Seeking a place to stand
Or a place to hide

[Verse 3]
Down in the crowded bars
Out for a good time
Can't wait to tell you all
What it's like up there
And they called it paradise
I don't know why
Somebody laid the mountains low
While the town got high

[Verse 4]
And then the chilly winds blew down
Across the desert
Through the canyons of the coast
To the Malibu
Where the pretty people play
Hungry for power
To light their neon way
And give them things to do

[Verse 5]
Some rich men came and raped the land
Nobody caught 'em
Put up a bunch of ugly boxes
And, Jesus, people bought 'em
And they called it paradise
The place to be
They watched the hazy sun
Sinking in the sea

[Verse 6]
You can leave it all behind
And sail to Lahaina
Just like the missionaries did
So many years ago
They even brought a neon sign
"Jesus is coming"
They brought the white man's burden down
Brought the white man's reign

[Verse 7]
Who will provide the grand design?
What is yours and what is mine?
'Cause there is no more new frontier
But we have got to make it here
We satisfy our endless needs
And justify our bloody deeds
In the name of destiny
And in the name of God

[Verse 8]
And you can see them there
On Sunday morning
And stand up and sing about
What it's like up there
They call it paradise
I don't know why
You call someplace paradise
Kiss it goodbye

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
Come to decide that the things that I tried
Were in my life just to get high on
When I sit alone, come get a little known
But I need more than myself this time
Step from the road to the sea to the sky
And I do believe that we rely on
When I lay it on, come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice

[Refrain: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
Hey, oh
Listen what I say, oh
I got your— Hey, oh
Now listen what I say, oh
(Oh)

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
When will I know that I really can't go
To the well once more time to decide on
When it's killing me, when will I really see
All that I need to look inside?
Come to believe that I better not leave
Before I get my chance to ride
When it's killing me, what do I really need
All that I need to look inside?

[Refrain: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
Hey, oh
Listen what I say, oh
Come back and— Hey, oh
Look at what I say, oh
(Oh)

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
The more I see, the less I know
The more I like to let it go
Hey, oh! Whoa-whoa

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Finally divided by a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go
In between the cover of another perfect wonder
And it's so white as snow
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go
Ho!

[Verse 3: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
When to descend to amend for a friend
All the channels that have broken down
Now you bring it up, I'm gonna ring it up
Just to hear you sing it out
Step from the road to the sea to the sky
And I do believe what we rely on
When I lay it on, come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice

[Refrain: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
Hey, oh
Listen what I say, oh
I got your— Hey, oh
Listen what I say, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
The more I see, the less I know
The more I like to let it go
Hey oh, whoa-whoa

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Finally divided by a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go
In between the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go

[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
(Uh-uh) I said, hey— Hey, yeah
Oh, yeah! Tell my love now
(Uh-uh) Hey— Hey, yeah
Oh, yeah! Tell my love now

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Finally divided by a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go

[Outro: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
(Uh-uh) I said, hey— Hey, yeah
Oh, yeah! Tell my love now
(Uh-uh) Hey— Hey, yeah
Oh, yeah!

[Intro]
Yeah (thats right, lets go)
Yeah (lets go, lets go)
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
Yeah (I'm extra good)
Yeah, yeah

[Hook : Kid Cudi]
I smoke I drink I do my thing
I'm livin' in my own world
And if they hate I let them
Who gives a fuck?
Anyone who know about what I do
I'm livin' in my own world
I chill back and I
Spread peace n love, yeah

[Verse 1 : Kid Cudi]
Have you ever led an alliance?
A bunch of stoner kids livin' life through defiance
Remember back when couldn't cop not one damn appliance
White tee, wrinkled and a mug
Adopted my mothers luck and quick wits
So I spy me a bobbin' head bitch from a mile away
Girls stay a mile away
Do the single lady dance by them other mother fuckers
Nah mean?
And why it gotta be about the ride, ride
At the bar place upon my car in the lot
And I'm blowin' smoke and the dro when I know my loans
Got me thinkin' huh? Where's plain pat at?
All I really know is that go time is about more than a night
Go now I feel a slump
You can't judge me cutie, I'm reckless
I got some mysteries that's confronted when the blunts lit

[Hook]
I smoke I drink I do my thing
I'm livin' in my own world
And if they hate I let them
Who gives a fuck?
Anyone who know about what I do
I'm livin' in my own world
I chill back and I spread peace n love, yeah

[Verse 2 : Snoop Dogg]
First off, fuck all the cloners
Can I shoot a shoutout to all the stoners?
No fingerprints, these isotoners
I'm still buyin' half Ps up off the corner
A nigga on one, better yet I'm on two
Whatchu waitin' on, blaze up, you want to?
Shake and take, get cakes they can shape and scrape
Got the whole world talkin' bout snoop
We wanna wake n bake,
Well lets go
Kid Cudi, my buddy, he got the best smoke
MCs n Gs yeah this the west coast
They say trees is trees
Nah, that's ses loc, let me deftly originate
So you'll appreciate the state of mind
When I'm flyin' high through the friendly skies
Open up your eyes and recognize
Mothership connection connected
Yeah, we gettin' hella high

[Hook]
I smoke I drink I do my thing
I'm livin' in my own world
And if they hate I let them
Who gives a fuck?

I chill back and I spread peace n love, yeah

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I ain't no killa but don't push me
I look a nigga in his eyes, tell ya if he pussy
Remembering the times the people would overlook me
The bitches would try to play me
My future was looking shady
Wanted to be a star, they lock me behind bars
Try to shatter my dreams, I tell you them times hard
I ain't never give up
I hustled, I grind hard
Put my faith in the Lord
I know I'mma shine hard
I had no choice but to win
But the odds was against me
So I'm rolling through this bitch with my palms on my Semi
My Dad died when I was young so my Mom would defend me
And my sister would protect me
Now the made niggas respect me
Had to learn to be a man, learn to hold my hands
Learn to work that scale, turn the mouses into grams
Learn to stack this money, work for two and feed the fam
Now I'm the best thing since zaf curry on the lamb
I got 30 in my Glock, moving I'm squeezing
Ocean Drive in the drop head like I'm dreaming
Leaning, Addicted to the money, I'm feigning
Shit you wish you saw, I seen it at 23
Skinny nigga, big dreams, lot of pride
Somebody get in the way of that, it's homicide
My heart cold as Omelly heart when his Mama died
Or cold like Tashima & Ta' when my Aunt Rhonda died
Niggas got fat when we starve, It wasn't Ramadan
But sunny days, we ain't need a lot of time
So I'm like Tony Hawk on a skating board, I gotta grind
What I wouldn't do for a dollar sign, I don't know
It ain't bout money nigga I don't go
Shoot him in his head now he's John Doe
Nine on me, Rondo
I turned a fuckin' quarter ounce into a condo
I turned a condo into a fuckin'

[Verse 2: Lou Williams]

They knock the breath out ya boy
Once he got sentenced
And I'm kinda tipsy so I'm spilling family business
At 10 I lost my pops, too many years he been missing
Mum B, mind gone at all time, that shit ridiculous
Bright lights and flights
See what this life will bring to you?
Bitches faming' my name
See what that shit'll bring to you?
The world is ice cold
Poncho, show him what that flame do
9 millimeters for evil, he can aim too
I seen it all befo'
Seen my mama praying
Seen my B forget my name
Seen my brother's walls cave in
Life is but a dream to me
Lately it's a nightmare
Cause it's a war going on and these people don't fight fair
Asking what the feeling like to see my family living right
Proud of myself because my name light up these Philly nights
God, I hope I'm living right and sorry for the tattoos
But if I go tonight, please take care of my nephews

[Verse 3: Mel Love]

I make the song cry
Make it drip, make it tear
Told you niggas from the rip
From the tier every beat
That I get I'mma rip, I'mma tear in pieces
Like deuces I be super sport creeping
I say, I be with the cool kids
Chilling on some cool shit
SRT-8 her like scrapers on some coon shit
I said we move shit
Eat a dick I do's this
They be on that goon shit
We on that Looney Tune shit
But I let that tool spit, air something
Bet I let that tool rip, tear something
Far way back, we head huntin'
We be on that shit for real a head buster
A Southsider, product of my environment, leadbuster
I be in the newest coupe
Blowing on some fruity fruit
Chain look like Juicy Fruit, mixed up Fruity Loops
Ayo where my boys at, squad up, hootie-hoo
Bitch you either out or in the circle like a hula hoop
Bitch I'm on that shit I talk that shit just like an interlude
And I spit that fire and you tire like an inner tube
All these niggas liars
Call me pliers how I'm grippin' dudes
You should see how I be dipping through
I said tell him they don't want this
They can take a drum clip
Candy in the pot or in the package like it's Fun Dip
I be on that real shit, they be on that nut shit
Cookie, pussy boy, bubblegum shit
Bitch made, uh

[Intro]
Uh (Yo, yo, yo)
Ya (Yo, yo)
Little old school shit (Yo, yo)

[Chorus]
So she came up to me and asked my name (Yo, yo)
I said it's Funky Mac, I don't play no games (Yo, yo)
If you wanna come home with me tonight (Yo, yo)
You better play ya cards right, heh (Yo, yo, yo)

[Verse 1]
I came to rock right now
I'm the best and I came to get down
I've been known to rock a microphone
She got a boyfriend, but left him home
See, I got style, so yes, I brag
The things I do just make them mad
Download new pics to my iPad
While your girlfriend look like she's dressed in drag
You a fad, this is forever, ladies in love with my agenda
My name's somethin' these girls remember
She write hers down, return to sender
I don't need it, Vicky, she can keep her secrets
One night only, that's how I treat this
Sleep in, bitch please, make me some breakfast
And then leave, haha

[Chorus]
So she came up to me and asked my name
I said it's Funky Mac, I don't play no games
If you wanna come home with me tonight
You better play ya cards right
So she came up to me and asked my name
I said it's Funky Mac, don't play no games
If you wanna come home with me tonight
You better play ya cards right

[Verse 2]
Hey
You see, I came to rock right now
I'm the best and I came to get down
I've been known to rock a microphone
Girls audition to bring them home
See, I might choose, so just go with it
Her mom adores me, dad thinks I'm a nitwit
That don't really matter, I'ma have her fall in love
I need my beauty, brains, booty, and she all of the above
Relationships, I hate that shit (Yo)
Got one night only, so make it quick (Yo, yo)
They see me out, wanna take a pic (Yo, yo)
Fuck me once, wanna date and shit (Yo, yo)
I ain't that rich, but I got bread (Yo, yo)
To make a sandwich, get me fed (Yo, yo)
Decide right now, don't got all night (Yo, yo)
This the life, so play ya cards right (Yo, yo)

[Chorus]
So she came up to me and asked my name
I said it's Funky Mac, I don't play no games
If you wanna come home with me tonight
You better play ya cards right
So she came up to me and asked my name
I said it's Funky Mac, don't play no games
If you wanna come home with me tonight
You better play ya cards right

[Intro]
Ooooooooooh!!!

[Verse 1]
All around the world, we could make time
Rompin' and a-stompin' 'cause I'm in my prime
Born in the North and sworn to entertain ya
'Cause I'm down for the state of Pennsylvania
I try not to whine, but I must warn ya
'Bout the motherfuckin' girls from California
Alabama baby said "Hallelujah"
Good God, girl, I wish I knew ya

[Chorus]
I know, I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
I know, I know it's you
You say "Hello" and then I say "I do"

[Verse 2]
Come back, baby, 'cause I'd like to say
I've been around the world, back from Bombay
Fox hole love, pie in your face
Living in and out of a big fat suitcase
Bonafide ride, step aside, Mike Johnson
Yes,
