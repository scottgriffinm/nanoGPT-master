- Looks like its me again.
- Everything's relative, you know.
65:06 - 65:09
- Well, you didn't miss your tonsils.
- How do you know?
65:09 - 65:11
Why don't you chop it off, Ringo?
65:11 - 65:15
Look John, I've had some great times
with this finger.
65:15 - 65:17
How do you know I wouldn't miss it?
65:17 - 65:19
You're a rat underneath.
65:19 - 65:22
You can have a fire and theft policy.
Five quid a week.
65:22 - 65:26
It's because you're a Beatle
that your fingers wasn't on it.
65:26 - 65:29
- Is there a cure for nail biting?
- (Paul) Oh, yes.
65:29 - 65:32
Oh, yes!
65:32 - 65:47
I'm always getting winked at these days.
It used to be you, Paul.
65:47 - 65:48
Oh, Sorry Ringo.
65:48 - 66:22
Peep boo!
66:22 - 66:28
All the rungs have been neatly sawn
in the middle.
66:28 - 66:30
Ah, the window!
66:30 - 66:35
(Roaring)
66:35 - 66:38
- Your famous Ringo is safe.
- No, he isn't.
66:38 - 66:47
What? Cover all exits.
Sharp lookout.
66:47 - 67:02
(Roaring)
67:02 - 67:06
(Bottle clinks)
67:06 - 67:14
- Don't move.
- You heard what she said.
67:14 - 67:19
Do you know Beethoven's
9th symphony?
67:19 - 67:21
It goes like this...
67:21 - 67:24
(Whistles "Ode To Joy")
67:24 - 67:32
(Tiger roars)
67:32 - 67:37
- What?
- This trap door.
67:37 - 67:40
Oh, here you are...
67:40 - 67:46
Permit me.
67:46 - 67:50
It's Raja, the famous Bengal man-eater
who escaped from the zoo this morning.
67:50 - 67:53
- So it is!
- Don't worry, he's harmless.
67:53 - 67:57
All you have to do is sing Beethoven's
Ode to Joy from the 9th symphony.
67:57 - 68:02
- Why didn't you think of that?
- Raja was reared on the classics.
68:02 - 68:07
(John) Don't worry, just whistle famous
Beethoven's famous 9th symphony.
68:07 - 68:09
Come on! Come on!
68:09 - 68:11
(Sings "Ode To Joy" in German)
68:11 - 68:37

68:37 - 68:45

68:45 - 68:57
(Cheering)
68:57 - 68:59
Beep, beep!
68:59 - 69:01
Psst!
69:01 - 69:04
- (Ringo) Who let it out?
- Nobody will know.
69:04 - 69:07
We're not going there.
69:07 - 69:11
- We just put it round we're going there.
- We're not going there.
69:11 - 69:15
- We just put it round.
- So everyone thinks we're going there?
69:15 - 69:17
- I'd like to go there.
- You wouldn't like it.
69:17 - 69:33
- Where are we going?
- Never you mind.
69:33 - 69:42
(Cameras click)
69:42 - 70:05
- You're welcome.
- Goodbye, sir.
70:05 - 70:43
Him!
70:43 - 70:46
- Welcome to Nassau.
- Thank you very much.
70:46 - 70:50
I'd like to present PC 17...

70:52 - 70:55

Oh, oh, oh!

Open that rock!

Whoa, whoa, whoa!
74:10 - 74:13
- Is that it?
- Better watch your fingers, Ringo!
74:13 - 74:17
Clang had the whole temple transported
here for your sacrifice.
74:17 - 74:19
He needn't have bothered.
Very nice of him, though.
74:19 - 74:23
- Whats this?
- This is where you'll be disembowelled.
74:23 - 74:26
You don't go for all that,
do you?
74:26 - 74:28
Keeps you busy, eh?
74:28 - 74:32
- Do you know where Clang is?
- I'm his mother and he's a good boy.
74:32 - 74:33
(Hollering)
74:33 - 74:36
I don't want to knock
anyone's religion, but...
74:36 - 74:41
- In here, quick.
- (Ringo) I can't swim.
74:41 - 74:50
I'm not going!
74:50 - 75:10
Where have they gone?
75:10 - 75:12
- Lets go back and get them!
- I'm game.
75:12 - 75:16
- Lets smash them!
- Lets find that temple.
75:16 - 75:20
- A man's got to do what he's got to do.
- I don't like running away.
75:20 - 75:23
- Lets go back and get them.
- They'll disembowel us.
75:23 - 75:27
- Not if I get the boot in first.
- Lets go back and get them.
75:27 - 75:46
They won't disembowel us, you see.
That's all gab - disembowelling...
75:46 - 75:49
- Signpost.
- Signpost.
75:49 - 75:52
- Guide book.
- Guide book.
75:52 - 75:56
- Feet.
- Feet? Oh, feet!
75:56 - 75:57
Red light.
75:57 - 76:00
Kaili!
76:00 - 76:12
- Green light, go!
- (Yells) Kaili!
76:12 - 76:15
The things we have to do
in these heathen countries.
76:15 - 76:29
There must be an easier way
to set a trap!
76:29 - 76:34
- Easterner speaks with forked tongue.
- What does he say?
76:34 - 76:37
Passing this way with hot foot
to the temple.
76:37 - 76:40
Don't encourage him!
You've got the part, Paul.
76:40 - 76:44
- Dare we ask how you know?
- How! I saw those footprints...
76:44 - 76:47
And this guidebook.
76:47 - 77:03
- To the temple.
- (Whistles)
77:03 - 77:21
After them... slowly!
77:21 - 77:25
- That's not it, is it?
- It's on the map as being here.
77:25 - 77:30
That temple under the rock,
that swimming pool that we came up in...
77:30 - 77:34
- I'm lost!
- This isn't a temple, is it?
77:34 - 77:38
- So this is a famous temple?
- Should be. It's gone.
77:38 - 77:41
I hope that disembowelling thingy
has gone, too.
77:41 - 77:44
- Was there ever a temple here?
- Never, sir.
77:44 - 77:49
Old army place. Well-known
place of retreat for courting couples
77:49 - 77:51
who like the echoes of bugles
as they court.
77:51 - 77:54
That's my theory.
77:54 - 77:56
Ugh!
77:56 - 77:58
- Aren't we going in?
- No, lets not.
77:58 - 78:01
Oh, come on lads,
where's that famous pluck?
78:01 - 78:04
- I haven't got any. Have you, George?
- Did have.
78:04 - 78:08
- I have had.
- I will have.
78:08 - 78:10
He's a bit soft that inspector,
isn't he?
78:10 - 78:12
He never takes his hat off.
78:12 - 78:30
It's very hot over here
for wearing a hat.
78:30 - 78:35
- I'm off.
- Typical!
78:35 - 78:37
(Yells) Kaili!
78:37 - 78:39
Argh!
78:39 - 78:44
- Kaili!
- Kaili!
78:44 - 78:46
(Electric buzz)
78:46 - 78:50
The fiends! They've electrified
the wire with high tension. HT.
78:50 - 79:06
The fiends!
79:06 - 79:08
(Hollers) Help me!
79:08 - 79:10
Help!
79:10 - 79:12
He's mine!
79:12 - 79:15
Help!
79:15 - 79:42
Help me!
79:42 - 79:48
There's one on the back,
but its not the right one.
79:48 - 79:54
Come here, boy! Let me explain.
79:54 - 80:00
This is no time for foolish tricks!
This is a hired car.
80:00 - 80:03
Back up and smash him off.
80:03 - 80:07
(Algernon) Now, this will get him!
80:07 - 80:11
Oh! Never mind. Try again.
80:11 - 80:17
This should give him a headache.
80:17 - 80:20
Where's he gone?
80:20 - 80:23
- That's done it, he's gone.
- I can't start the car.
80:23 - 80:26
- (Engine splutters)
- Hello.
80:26 - 80:31
Oh, hello! Hang on a minute...
80:31 - 80:36
On, on!
80:36 - 80:38
I seem to be having
a slight difficulty.
80:38 - 80:51
To the right! oh...
80:51 - 80:56
- I think it might be the wrong key.
- On!
80:56 - 80:59
On!
80:59 - 81:04
(Engine starts)
81:04 - 81:20
(Algernon) Got it.
Didn't take long, did it?
81:20 - 81:28
Thanks for the lift, sailor!
81:28 - 81:31
- Where did the thugs go?
- They've vanished.
81:31 - 81:33
- He's got a plan.
- Avery famous plan.
81:33 - 81:35
Superintendent, you've got a plan.
81:35 - 81:37
- Yes...
- Superintendent.
81:37 - 83:21
I've got a plan.
83:21 - 83:23
(Hollers) Ringo!
83:23 - 83:25
Ringo!
83:25 - 83:28
- Ringo!
- Ringo!
83:28 - 83:30
- Ringo!
- Ringo!
83:30 - 83:32
Ringo!
83:32 - 83:34
(Dogs bark)
83:34 - 83:46
Ringo!
83:46 - 83:47
All right, talk!
83:47 - 83:55
We know he's a prisoner,
but where?
83:55 - 83:57
- I'm a perfect surgeon.
- Huh?
83:57 - 84:00
- I'm a perfect surgeon.
- He was asked to take it up.
84:00 - 84:03
Alas... Scalpel.
84:03 - 84:12
Sca...
84:12 - 84:15
Sand in the generator.
84:15 - 84:18
It gets everywhere. No wonder
I never get anything done.
84:18 - 84:21
Fix it, Algernon.
84:21 - 84:24
You wouldn't want me to go in
with a blunt scalpel.
84:24 - 84:26
Fix it!
84:26 - 84:30
I'm a decent employer,
but he takes advantage of me.
84:30 - 84:37
- It's the heat, it makes him stroppy.
- Luckily.
84:37 - 84:40
I've got some juice.
84:40 - 84:44
(Ringo) I can't understand it. They kept
pulling my nose. Mine of all noses!
84:44 - 84:48
- Whats that?
- Distilled from the essence of orchids.
84:48 - 84:52
Hands up!
84:52 - 84:54
- Whats that?
- Distilled from the essence...
84:54 - 84:59
Not distilled from the essence of orchids
found only in certain recesses?
84:59 - 85:05
At last! I'll have my just reward.
Give it to me! Sir Tberius Foot Juice!
85:05 - 85:08
- But the ring...
- Who needs it now that I have this.
85:08 - 85:11
- Do you know what this is?
- A Webley automatic...
85:11 - 85:15
It's Nobel Prize juice. Set sail for home,
for England! A jewel set in the sea!
85:15 - 85:18
The government in the palm of my hand.
Whats it say?
85:18 - 85:20
- You're going on a sea voyage...
- No, this!
85:20 - 85:24
- (Algernon) I don't know.
- Haven't you a degree in Eastern?
85:24 - 85:27
- (Algernon) I don't think so.
- Lets get it translated.
85:27 - 85:33
- Now!
- Right!
85:33 - 85:43
- I can't swim.
- What do you mean you can't swim?
85:43 - 85:46
(Clang) Treacherous Woman,
tremble...

daughter of the mountains,

made the whole world tremble.
85:52 - 85:55
- Wait till my mates get you.
- I don't think so...
85:55 - 86:00
We've had two battalions flown in
specially to ambush your friends.
86:00 - 86:02
They're quite merciless.
86:02 - 86:08
One word of warning from you
and you die instantly.
86:08 - 86:11
Oh, mother Kaili,
86:11 - 86:13
whose name is the Terrible...
86:13 - 86:15
I'm going to miss the sacrifice.
86:15 - 86:18
(Clang) ...whose name
is the inaccessible,
86:18 - 86:24
whose name is the Black Mother,
mother of darkness!
86:24 - 86:25
We turn our hearts to...
86:25 - 86:27
(Ringo) No!
86:27 - 86:29
(Clang) ...drinker of blood...
86:29 - 86:32
- It's off! I'm saved!
- ...killer of demons,
86:32 - 86:36
drink of this vessel,
gorge on this blood, our offering...
86:36 - 86:40
Get sacrificed!
I don't subscribe to your religion!
86:40 - 86:44
- There he is!
- It just came off!
86:44 - 86:46
(Yells) Quickly! After them!
86:46 - 86:48
I'm going to miss the sacrifice.
86:48 - 86:52
- It came off! I just showed courage.
- How many fingers you got left?
86:52 - 86:55
- You're all red again.
- I'm beginning to like it.

When I go to sleep, I never count sheep, I count all the charms about Linda
And lately it seems in all of my dreams, I walk with my arms about Linda
But what good does it do me, for Linda doesn't know I exist
Can't help feeling gloomy, think of all the lovin I've missed
We pass on the street ,my heart skips a beat, I say to myself, hello, Linda
If only she'd smile I'd stop for a while, and then I would get to know Linda
But miracles still happen and when my lucky star begins to shine
With one little kiss, I'll make Linda mine
Out here in the fields
I fight for my meals
I get my back into my living
I don't need to fight
To prove I'm right
I don't need to be forgiven
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Don't cry
Don't raise your eye
It's only teenage wasteland

Sally, take my hand
Travel south cross land
Put out the fire
Don't look past my shoulder
The exodus is here
The happy ones are near
Let's get together
Before we get much older
Teenage wasteland
It's only teenage wasteland
Teenage wasteland
It's only teenage wasteland
They're all wasted
The children of the summer's end gathered in the dampened grass
We played our songs and felt the London sky resting on our hands
It was God's land
It was ragged and naive
It was Heaven
Touch, we touched the very soul of holding each and every life
We claimed the very source of joy ran through
It didn't, but it seemed that way
I kissed a lot of people that day
Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon
To paint that love upon a white balloon
And fly it from the toppest top of all the tops that man has pushed beyond his brain
Satori must be something just the same
We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and size
We talked with tall Venusians passing through
And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head and away they soared
Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd and we walked back to the road, unchained

The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party
So messed up, I want you here
In my room, I want you near
Now I wanna be face to face
And I lay right down in my favorite place
Now I wanna be your dog
Now I wanna be your dog
Now I wanna be your dog
C'mon..
Now I'm ready to take your hand
Lose my heart on the burning sand
Now I'm ready to take your eyes
Lose my soul and let it fry
Now I wanna be your dog
Now I wanna be your dog
Now I wanna be your dog
Well c'mon..
If I leave here tomorrow
Would you still remember me?
For I must be travelling on now
There's just too many places I've got to see

But if I stay here with you, girl
Things just couldn't be the same
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you cannot change
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

And this bird you cannot change
And this bird you cannot change
Lord knows I can't change

Bye bye, baby, it's been a sweet love yeah, yeah
And though this feeling I can't change
But please don't take this so badly
'Cause Lord knows I'm to blame

But if I stay here with you, girl
Things just couldn't be the same
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you cannot change
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And this bird you cannot change
And this bird you cannot change
Lord knows I can't change
Lord, help me, I can't change

Lord, I can't change
Won't you fly high free bird?
Yeah
Yo
There is no smile on my face No laughter in my eyes
Life may seem like a waste
But after nigga dies
Then you get the picture
I been tryin to show you for the longest
Niggas know
?Don't test the flow?
I'm the strongest
Whats wrong is the way fake niggas MAKE NIGGAS
Let em have it
?Reachin for the flame?huh
Let em grab it
What you don't know is gonna get you hurt
Five years later ha , dirt
Ashes to ashes, life passes on
Back to the essence, your presence is gone
WE ALL KNOW IT WAS WRONG!
But it still happen...
N dem punk motherfuckaz that did it is still strappin
Like they can't get it, but they will
Niggas talkin bout doing something, but they chill
Cuz they know, like I know the black albino is comin through like a rhino
Where my dogs at?
I'm looking over the skyline of the city
How loud quiet nights in the mist of crime
How next door to happiness lives sorrow
And signals of solution in the sky

(chorus)
A city of justice, a city of love, a city of peace
For everyone of us
We all need it, can't live without it
A Gotham City (oh yeah)

How sleeping awake because of fear. (ohh yeah)
How children are drowning in their tears
How we need a place where we can go
A land where every one will have a hero (even me)

(chorus 2x)
Yet in the middle of stormy weather
We won't stumble and we won't fall
I know a place where all this shelter..
(repeat chorus until end)

[Verse 1]
Merry run around, sailin' up and down
Looking for a shove in some direction
Got it from the top, it's nothing you can stop
Lord, you know they made a fine connection

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Verse 2]
He could pass his time, around some other line
But you know he chose this place beside her
Don't get in their way, there's nothing you can say
Nothing that you need to add or do

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
It's nothing, they explain, it's like a diesel train
You better not be there when it rolls over
And when that train rolls in, you wonder where it's been
You gotta try and see a little further

[Bridge]
Though you'll make a noise, just can't hear your voice
All the dizzy ride on your cold shoulder

Won't you believe what I say is true?
Everything I did I heard it first from you

[Verse 4]
Everything I tell you, I heard it first from you
Heard your news report, you know you're falling short
Pretty soon, we'll trust you for the weather
When that ship comes in, you won't know where it's been
You got to try to see a little further

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Chorus]
Oh baby, things are changing now and I can't tell where
I'll be from here on out, ooh, it's hell
Knowing that for now
We shouldn't kiss and tell when it's so good, yeah

[Verse 1]
You walk up to me like a stranger, girl
And I already know your name
I can make you feel good
If you want, yeah
Give me the time of day
Won't you listen to me here and now?
'Cause I'll lay it down simple and plain
Ooh, it'd be good to get together, girl
But it'll be so hard to maintain
'Cause it seems like now

[Chorus]
Oh baby, things are changing now and I can't tell where
I'll be from here on out, ooh, it's hell
Knowing that for now
We shouldn't kiss and tell when it's so good, yeah

[Verse 2]
I told you already, girl
That I, oh, I was so gone
But that sweet, sweet love
Yeah, it had me hanging on
So strong and I, I know now, girl
That I, oh, I can stand alone
I was put here on this Earth by myself, yeah
Woah, I gotta keep moving on
'Cause it seems like now

[Chorus]
Oh baby, things are changing now and I can't tell where
I'll be from here on out, ooh, it's hell
Knowing that for now
We shouldn't kiss and tell when it's so good, yeah

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Don't ever kiss no one but me
If you do, dear, you'll break my heart
It's not because I doubt you
But I'm such a fool about you
I've got a jealous lovin' heart
Now where there's love, there's jealousy
Good and bad just won't tear apart
They always go together
Like fair and stormy weather
I've got a jealous lovin' heart
You're all I want (You're all I want)
You're all I need (You're all I need)
Please don't tear my soul apart
Just say you love me, too, dear
Then be careful what you do, dear
I've got a jealous lovin' heart
Repeat first verse

[Intro: Pitbull & Jennifer Lopez]
It's Mr. Worldwide
With the J to the L (O-o-o-o-o)
Jenny, let me talk to 'em

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
If you think it's a joke, go 'head and laugh
Created my own lane, created my path
Graduated at high school, just not with my class
I'm like Einstein, I created my math
Hated algebra, but I loved to multiply
So I took my letters and made 'em numbers, right?
Will you evaluate? Jennifer, baby, let's celebrate

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I done had a long week
Now it's time to celebrate
I done had a long week
Now it's time to celebrate

This drink's for you (La, de, da, de, da, de, da, de, da, de, da)

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
(Woo!)
This is for my singles ladies and single mothers
Raising babies, working hard
I know the feeling, I used to live it
My mother worked two to three jobs
That's what this song is dedicated
To all the women out there, motivated
Always finding ways to make ends meet
All my women out there, innovative
You name the game, and they've played it
They've heard all the stories, so save it
All my women with power, meet me at happy hour
Let's celebrate

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I done had a long week
Now it's time to celebrate
I done had a long week
Now it's time to celebrate
I done had a long week
Now it's time to celebrate
I done had a long week
Now it's time to celebrate
This drink's for you (La, de, da, de, da, de, da, de, da, de, da)
This drink's for you (La, de, da, de, da, de, da, de, da, de, da)

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
(Woo!)
I see you, baby, getting your hair done, getting your nails tight
I see you, baby, trying on different outfits
Making sure they fit right
I see you, baby, getting ready for the night
Making sure you look right
I see you, baby
I see you, baby

[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez & (Pitbull)]
You can't stop the beat (Can't stop the beat)
La da da da de
Get up on your feet, let's go (Can't stop the beat)
You can't stop the beat (Can't stop the beat)
La da da da de (Can't stop the beat)
Get up on your feet, let's go (Can't stop the beat)
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go (Go, go, go, go, go, go go)
(Talk to me)

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I done had a long week
Now it's time to celebrate
I done had a long week

I done had a long week
Now it's time to celebrate
I done had a long week
Now it's time to celebrate

[Outro: Jennifer Lopez & Pitbull]

This drink's for you (La, de, da, de, da, de, da, de, da, de, da)
(Everyday, party)
I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
Till love came and told me I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

Lost my heart but what of it
She is cold, I agree
She can laugh and I love it
Although the laugh's on me

I'll sing to her, each spring to her
And long for the day I can cling to her
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I
What all can you give, with five minutes to live?
Hear the tock tick tock of the laughing clock
What can you do or say?
Maybe you oughta pray
But you better think positive
You got five minutes to live

Time is flying by, now don't you sit there and let it fly
You better come on strong, you can't stay here long
That bell is gonna ring
This is a final fling
Ain't no alternative
You got five minutes to live

What all can you give, With five minutes to live
Get dressed for your date or you're gonna be late
Live a little while you can
Don't you sit there and ring your hands
Here comes a great big sedative
You got five minutes to live

[Chorus: will.i.am & (apl.de.ap)]
I got that fire (Fire), fire (Fire), fire (Fire), fire (Fire), fire (Fire), fire
For the dance floor
I got that fire (Fire), fire (Fire), fire (Fire), fire (Fire), fire (Fire)

Feel that heat rising up
Hear that beat, turn it up
Baby, movin', that's what's up
Baby, baby, boombercut
Boombercut
Do that dance
Got me lookin' in a trance
Just like fire when she dance
Someone call the ambulance

[Verse 2: apl.de.ap with will.i.am.]
I like it, you like it
You li-li-like futureistic
Just ride it, don't fight it
Ge-ge-ge-get down to the music
Don't stop it, get rockin'
It's comin' like a bullet
It's burning like fire
So go ahead and lose it

[Chorus: will.i.am]
Turn it up
Turn it up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up-up
For the dancefloor

[Verse 3: will.i.am]
Turn it up

D-A-V-I-D, take me for the dancefloor
Will. I is on reposition
I'll be cutting like incision
Get a ghetto for the dancefloor (Floor)

[Bridge: will.i.am]
The G, the U, the T, the T, the A
The A-A, we don't play
Weepy, weepy, rock, rock, rock, rock
Sh-sh-shit like every day
Feel the sound, powerful
Mega boots on overload
Electric City pumpin' on the dance-ce-cefloor

[Chorus: will.i.am & (apl.de.ap)]
I got that fire (Fire), fire (Fire), fire (Fire), fire (Fire), fire (Fire), fire
For the dance floor

You S H E are
(Oh no no no no no)
You S H E are
(Oh no, oh no, oh no)

Check it, it was like six of us
Three in the Benz, three in the truck
On eighty-five headed to the plush
Ten minutes later is when we pulled up

I parked the Benz, hit the alarm, glanced down at my rims
Tucked in my pant leg in the tongue of my Timbs
Hand in my shirt 'til we feel the gin, proceeded to walk in
Just then I saw this, magnificient misses sippin' on a glass of Cris'
With a couple of her friends giggling, I knew

You are the one, I don't give a damn
Even if ya got a man, take my hand, girl
You are the one, girl, I know you'll understand
If you just give me a dance, take a chance, girl
Said I know you got a few with you
Don't even trip, I got my crew here too
Can ya grill what ya wanna do?
I really wanna chill with you

Tell your friends they can hop in the truck
We'll take the Benz but if we split up
Maybe we can hook up again
You never know I guess that all depends

If I can get you from the floor to the door of my 6-0-0
2-0 momos on low pros
So finish that Mo', get your coat
Tell your girls "Come on, let's go" 'cuz you are

You are the one, I don't give a damn
Even if ya got a man, take my hand, girl
You are the one, girl, I know you'll understand
If you just give me a dance, take a chance, girl

You are the one, I don't give a damn
Even if ya got a man, take my hand, girl
You are the one, girl, I know you'll understand
If you just give me a dance, take a chance, girl

You S H E are
Say it
You S H E are
One, three
You are the one, I don't give a damn
Even if ya got a man, take my hand, girl
You are the one, girl, I know you'll understand
If you just give me a dance, take a chance, girl

You are the one, I don't give a damn
Even if ya got a man, take my hand, girl
You are the one, girl, I know you'll understand
If you just give me a dance, take a chance, girl

You are the one, I don't give a damn
Even if ya got a man, take my hand, girl
You are the one, girl, I know you'll understand
If you just give me a dance, take a chance, girl

You S H E are
Say it
You S H E are
One, three

You S H E are
Say it
You S H E are
One, three
If it's love that you're running from, there's no hiding place
(You can't run it, you can't hide it, you can't run it)
Love has problems I know but there problems
We'll just have to face, oh yeah
If you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
Keep on walking, don't look back
(Don't look back)
And don't look back, oh yeah
(Don't look back)
And don't look back, baby
(Don't look back)
(The past is behind you, let nothing remind you)
If your first lover broke your heart
There's something that can be done
(You don't run it, you don't hide it, you don't run it)
Don't end your faith in love because of what he's done
So, if you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
Keep on walking, don't look back
(Don't look back)
Forget about the past now, don't look back, baby
(Don't look back)
Keep on walking and don't look back
(Don't look back)
(The places behind you, let them re-remind you)
Love can be a beautiful thing
Though your first love let you down, oh yeah
(You don't run it, you don't hide it, you don't run it)
'Cause I know we can make love bloom, baby
The second time around, oh yeah
So, if you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
Keep on pushing, don't look back
(Don't look back)
Now, till I say, we won't look back, girl
(Don't look back)
Keep on walking and won't look back
Forget about the past now, baby
(Don't look back)
And don't look back, baby, baby, baby
(Don't look back)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, don't look back
I want to jump but I'm afraid I'll fall
I want to holler but the joint's too small
Young man rhythm got a hold on me too
I got the rockin' pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu

I want to kiss, baby, that ain't all
I want to kiss her but the gal's too small
Young man rhythm got a hold on me too
I got the rockin' pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu

I want to holler, baby, don't you know
I would be running but my feet's too slow
Young man rhythm got a hold on me too
I got the rockin' pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu

I want to scream but that ain't all
My baby loves me, Lord, she's carrying on
Young man rhythm got a hold on me too
I got the rockin' pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu

I want to jump but I'm afraid I'll fall
I want to holler but the joint's too small
Young man rhythm got a hold on me too
I got the rockin' pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu
I want to scream, baby, that ain't all
I want to kiss her but the girl's too tall
Young man rhythm got a hold on me too
I got the rockin' pneumonia and the boogie woogie flu
Get get up, get get on
Get get up, get get on
Get get up, get get on
Get get up, get get on

I need to make the proper connection
To get my popper injection
My customs insfection
So I can proceed in the right direction
I need to ride, ride, ride, ride

Get get up, get get on
Get get up, get get on
Get get up, get get on
Get get up, get get on

Sunshine or rain, pleasure or pain
Release my stress, release my pain
Don't want it simple, don't want to plane
I want some men in there on a frame
Bring on the wreck, bring on the chamb'
You've got me waitin', waitin' in vain
Don't make me wait
Please don't make me wait

You get the jab on the boys on a play
We know to lay, it's time to slave
Side to side, ready for the ride
Up and down, swing its around...

Get get up, get get on
Get get up, get get on
Get get up, get get on
Get get up, get get on

Are you the conductor ?
Be my instructor
Simple and plane, show me the train
Can I please get on the last train

Get get up, get get on
Get get up, get get on
Get get up, get get on
Get get up, get get on
Get get up, get get on
Get get up, get get on
Get get up, get get on
Get get up, get get on
Can I please get on the last train...
Uh uh
Hey baby how you
Why yo face lookin' all sad and blue
Don't you like the Navigator truck that I brought you
Why you trying to act a fool
Don't try to say you seen me talking to your girlfriends
Ask Tonya and Shirl then
Gimme a place and time when
Don't try to accuse me of silly stuff that I'm doing on the streets
You gotta remember, without you, there's no me
I'm just an average man
Tryin' to make it in this cold world
Tell me baby, why you trippin', girl

I don't want to fuss with you
So I'm gonna sit out on the couch
Don't try to talk to me
'cause boy I am blocking you out
I don't want to hear a thing
Nothing you got to say
You should think twice
About the way you've been talking to me

[Chorus]
Pack yo bags
Get on the bus
Ain't got no time (for)
Talkin' all yo stuff
Need to pack my stuff
Since this's what you want
I don't really care
There's no more
Go catch a cab or
Get on the bus
I ain't got no time for
You talkin' all that junk
Better get my stuff
Since this is what you want
I don't really care

I ain't got no words for you
So you can stop callin' my friends
Tellin' them it wasn't your fault
And why I ain't lettin' you in
Too many times before
I let you back in my life
But this is a new day
And this won't go down tonight

[Chorus]
Mm, mm (da-da-duh-da-da)
Mm, mm (who)
Mm, mm
Mm, mm {say what}

Introduce you to Dolce and Gervana
Advance you from dirt bikes to Hondas
Took you from that terrible stress
Now you telling me that I am a bother
What kind of mess is that
To tell a man who put you on his team
That's just like killing a dream
(No no baby) That's how it seems
I worked hard to build up what I had for you
I pray to God, that there's not another man between me and you
So just tell me
There's no need to lie for
While you sleepin' with your eyes closed
Do you want to talk, aight yo

[Chorus: x2]

Next message

[Stephen Carpenter]
Yo, what up? It's Stef, call me up
I'm gonna be in town all this week
So uhh if you wanna get that track taken care of
Let me know. Call me on my cell, later
When you fight with your lover
She takes you for a fool
She don't care how she hurts you
Long as she's doing what she choose
That's wrong little mama
That's wrong little mama
That's wrong little mama
That ain't the way to do

When you work each day
Stay at home every night
She'd find a fault with everything
Ain't nothin' ever right

That's wrong little mama
That's wrong little mama
That's wrong little mama
That ain't the way to do

And she's out on the weekend
She'd come back holdin' her head
You ask her for some lovin'
She'll say she's half-dead
That's wrong, little mama
That's wrong, little mama
That's wrong, little mama
That ain't the way to do

Oh, it's wrong little mama
Yes, it's wrong little mama
I say, it's wrong little mama
You know it's wrong little mama
Yeah, it's wrong little mamma
I am happy now
You see
I could make a tiny weenie minnie party for me

I do have some regrets
But thank God I've paid all my checks
And I have this letter back to you

Thank you for all those
Feelings, pictures, beauties on my hands
It could also be a gentle match

But I will take my shot a little further
I'm not sure about my cover
I would spend my hundred dollars
Just to stop the time and think:

"Why is this good for me?" (3x)

I am pleasent now I know you can't feel
I definitely doing a big party for real
I do have some regrets
But thank God I've paid all my checks
And I have this letter back to you

Thank you for all those
Feelings, pictures, beauties on my hands
It could also be a perfect match

So I will take my shot a little faster
I don't care about my accent
I would spend my hundred dollars
Just to stop the time and say:

"Yes, this is good for me." (5x)
I-I love the colorful clothes she wears
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
I hear the sound of a gentle word
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air

I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations)

Close my eyes, she's somehow closer now
Softly smile, I know she must be kind
When I look in her eyes
She goes with me to a blossom world

I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations)
(Ahh)
(Ah, my my, what elation)
I don't know where but she sends me there
(Oh, my my, what a sensation)
(Oh, my my, what elation)
(Oh, my my, what)

Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin'

(Ahh)

Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
(I'm pickin' up good vibrations) (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations

Look at that sky, life's begun
Nights are warm and the days are young

There's my baby, lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Come, get up, my baby)

Last night they loved you
Opening doors and pulling some strings, angel
(Come, get up, my baby)
In walked luck and you looked in time
Never look back, walk tall, act fine
(Come, get up, my baby)
I'll stick with you baby for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years, gold
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Come, get up, my baby)

Some of these days, and it won't be long
Gonna drive back down where you once belonged
In the back of a dream car, twenty foot long
Don't cry my sweet, don't break my heart
Doing all right, but you gotta get smart
Wish upon wish upon day upon day, I believe, oh, Lord
I believe all the way
(Come, get up, my baby)

Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years

There's my baby, lost that's all
Once I'm begging you save her little soul
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Come, get up, my baby)

Don't let me hear you say life's taking you nowhere, angel
(Come, get up, my baby)
Run for the shadows, run for the shadows
Run for the shadows in these golden years
I'll stick with you, baby, for a thousand years
Nothing's gonna touch you in these golden years, gold
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
(Golden years, gold, whop-whop-whop)
Lullay, thou little tiny Child
By-bye lully, lullay
Lullay, thou little tiny Child
By-bye lully, lullay

O sisters too, how may we do
For to preserve this day
This poor Youngling for whom we sing
By-bye lully, lullay

Herod the King, in his raging
Charged he hath this day;
His men of might, in his own sight
All children young, to slay

Then woe is me, poor Child, for Thee
And ever mourn and say;
For Thy parting nor say nor sing
By-bye lully, lullay
It starts with just a little glance now
Right away you're thinkin' 'bout romance now
You know you ought to take it slower
But you just can't wait to get to know her

A brand new love affair is such a beautiful thing
But if you're not careful think about the pain it can bring

It makes you feel so bad
It makes your heart feel sad
It makes your days go wrong
It makes your nights so long

You've got to keep in mind love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast

Right now you think that she's perfection
This time is really an exception
Well you know I hate to be a downer
But I'm the guy she left before you found her
Well I'm not saying you won't have a good love with her
But I keep on remembering things like they were

She made me feel so bad
She made my heart feel sad
She made my days go wrong
And made my nights so long

You've got to keep in mind love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast

Keep in mind love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast

Love is here today
And it's gone tomorrow
It's here and gone so fast
(Clifford T. Ward)

You've come Up In The World
And it's all to your credit
You made something of your life
Like you always said you would
But what ever happened to the girl
I used to know and all those halcyon days of love?
You've come Up In The World
And it's such a shame
You made success of a dream
But it seems so empty now
With your weak excuses and your
Condescending ways and
Your all-too-frequent nights alone
Every time I move I lose
When I look I'm in
And every time I turn around
I'm back in love

I get mixed emotions
It's the way my feelings flow
Excuse me I'm only human
Sometimes I, I just don't know

Every time I move I lose
When I look I'm in
And every time I turn around
I'm back in love again

Do do do do do
Back in love again
Do do do do do
Back in love

When you put your arms around me
I feel so satisfied
I want to love you forever
I just can't, I can't decide
Every time I move I lose
When I look I'm in
And every time I turn around
I'm back in love again

Right back, right back in love again
(Alright)
Seems like, seems like
Back in love again

Now it's your lover
I know it's hard just to be a friend
That's something else I discovered
I guess I just don't ever want it to end

Every time I move I lose
When I look I'm in
And every time I turn around
I'm back in love again

Right back, right back in love again
Seems like, seems like
That I'm back in love again
Right back, right back in love again
(Oh yeah alright)
Seems like, seems like
I'm back in love again
I just don't believe it
Back in love again
(Right back, I'm back)
I can't believe it
(Right back, I'm back)
Every time I turn around
Back in love again
(Right back, I'm back)
I get so many mixed emotions
I'm back in love again
(Right back, I'm back)
Every time I turn around
Oh my love Jones coming down

Back in love again
(Right back, I'm back)
Alright, alright, alright
(Right back, I'm back)
Help me, help me, help me back in love
(I'm back, I'm back)
Oh yeah, back in love again
(Right back, I'm back)
I get so many mixed emotions yes I do
(Right back, I'm back)

(Right back, I'm back)
(Right back, I'm back)
Hear me, hear me, hear me
I'm back in love, back in
(Right back, I'm back)
Back in love again
(Right back, I'm back)
I was once your lover
I was once your lover
And I'm just your friend, yeah
(Right back, I'm back)
Oh, I'm back in love, I'm back in love
I'm back in love, I'm back in love again
(Right back, I'm back)

[Verse 1: John Denver]
He was born in the Bitterroot Valley in the early morning rain
Wild geese over the water, heading north and home again
Bringin' a warm wind from the south, bringin' the first taste of the spring
His mother took him to her breast and softly she did sing:

[Chorus: John Denver]
Oh, Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies

[Verse 2: John Denver]
His mother died that summer and he never learned to cry
He never knew his father and he never did ask why
He never knew the answers that would make an easy way
But he learned to know the wilderness and to be a man that way

[Verse 3: John Denver, Emmylou Harris]
His mother's brother took him in to his family and his home
Gave him a hand that he could lean on and a strength to call his own
And he learned to be a farmer and he learned to love the land
And he learned to read the seasons and he learned to make a stand

[Chorus: John Denver, Emmylou Harris]
Oh, Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies

[Verse 4: John Denver, Emmylou Harris]
On the eve of his 21st birthday, he set out on his own
He was 30 years and runnin' when he found his way back home
Ridin' a storm across the mountains and an achin' in his heart
Said he came to turn the pages and to make a brand new start

[Verse 5: John Denver]
Now he never told the story of the time that he was gone
Some say he was a lawyer, some say he was a john
There was something in the city that he said he couldn't breathe

[Chorus: John Denver, Emmylou Harris]
Oh, Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies

[Bridge: John Denver]
Now some say he was crazy and some are glad he's gone
But some of us will miss him and we'll try to carry on
Giving a voice to the forest, giving a voice to the dawn
Giving a voice to the wilderness and the land that he lived on

[Chorus: John Denver, Emmylou Harris]
Oh, Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies

[Chorus: John Denver, Emmylou Harris]
Oh, Montana, give this child a home
Give him the love of a good family and a woman of his own
Give him a fire in his heart, give him a light in his eyes
Give him the wild wind for a brother and the wild Montana skies
Something in the way she moves, attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me, I don't wanna leave her now
You know I believe in how.....

Somewhere in her smile she knows, that I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me. I don't wanna leave her now
You know I believe in how.....

You're askin' me will my love grow, I don't know, I don't know?
Just stick around now, it may show. I don't know, I don't know?

Something in the way she knows, and all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me. I don't wanna leave her now
You know I believe in how.....

You're askin me will my love grow. I don't know, no I don't know?
You stick around now, it may show. I don't know, I don't know?

Something in the way she knows me, and all I have to do is just think
Of her. Something in the things she shows me. I don't wanna leave her
Now. You know I believe in how.....
Don't want to leave her now.....
You're looking nervous at the dealer
Money goes like sand
Slipping through your hands
You're leaving everything behind you
Wave it all goodbye
I can hear you cry

Wait - don't think about it
Wait - it's never too late
Wait - don't worry 'bout it
Wait - leave it all to fate
Wait

Oh no this game is like a nightmare
There can be no doubt
Luck has dealt me out
I'm only searching for the right time
Money on the line
I can hear you cry
Imagine there's no Heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace

You may say that I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us

And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world
You may say that I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will live as one
You don't like crazy music
You don't like rockin'
You just wanna go to a movie show
Sit there, holdin' hands

You're so square
Baby I don't care

I don't care why my heart blips
I only know it does
I only wanna love you, baby
I guess it's just because

You're so square
Baby I don't care

You don't even know any dance steps
But I do
I only know why I love you
And I do, I do, a do, a do, a do
You don't like crazy music
Don't like rockin', baby
You just wanna go to a movie show
Sit there holdin' hands

You're so square
Baby I don't care
Baby I don't care
Baby I don't care, hey
I've got my eyes on you, so best beware where you roam
I've got my eyes on you, so don't stray too far from home
Incidentally, I've set my spies on you

I'm checking all you do, from a to zee
So, darling, just be wise, keep your eyes on me

[Verse 1]
They say the neon lights are bright on Broadway
They say there's always magic in the air
But when you're walkin' down the street
And you ain't had enough to eat
The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere

[Verse 2]
They say the women treat you fine on Broadway
But lookin' at them just gives me the blues
'Cause how you gonna make some time
When all you got is one thin dime
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes?

[Verse 3]
They say that I won't last too long on Broadway
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home, they all say
But they're dead wrong, I know they are
'Cause I can play this here guitar
I won't quit 'til I'm a star on Broadway

[Outro]
On Broadway
On Broadway
Gimme that crack
Gimme some of that crack
Gimme that crack
Ahhh
Broadway
Stepping outside
There's no turning back
Looking behind
There's no turning back
Nowhere to hide—
Watch out for the man in drag;
She's got you tagged!

Checking all around
There's no turning back
Listen for a sound
There's no turning back
Keep your head down—
Watch out for the go-between!

The cloak and dagger man follows
Run undercover and trust in no one you know

Watch what you say
There's no turning back
Lovers will betray!
Watch out for the promise of...
The cloak and dagger man follows
Run undercover and trust in no one you know
Little girl, little girl what have I done
To make you treat me so
You have caused me to weep, you have caused me to moan
You have caused me to leave my home

In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun never shines
I shiver when the cold winds blow

My daddy was a railroad man
Drove a mile and a half uptown
His head was found 'neath the driving wheel
His body has never been found

In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun never shines
I shiver when the cold winds blow

The longest train I ever saw
Was down that northern line
The engine passed by at ten o'clock
The cab passed by at nine
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun never shines
I shiver when the cold winds blow

Little girl, little girl what have I done
To make you treat me so
You have caused me to weep, you have caused me to moan
You have caused me to leave my home

In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun never shines
I shiver when the cold winds blow

The longest train that ever I saw
Went down the Georgia line
The engine passed at six o'clock
And the cab it passed at nine

In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun never shines
And you shiver when the cold wind blows

I asked my captain for the time of day
He (said?) throwed his watch away
It's a long steel rail and a short cross tie
I'm on my way back home
In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun never shines
I shiver when the cold winds blow

Little girl, little girl, what have I done
That makes you treat me so
You caused me to weep, and caused me to mourn
You caused me to leave my home

In the pines, in the pines
Where the sun never shines
I shiver when the cold winds blow

[Verse 1]
Sittin' outside your door
About to break down
Fourth time this week
Somebody's come around
Who's it gonna be tonight?
Who's the lucky man?
Where you get the attitude
I'll never understand
Uh oh, here he comes now
So happy that he came
Hey! Was it good boy?
Thoughts so over lame

[Pre-Chorus 1]
What goes on inside your head
That makes you want to take them all to bed?

[Chorus]
Gotta stop, gotta, gotta stop messin' about
You know you gotta stop, gotta, gotta stop messin' about
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
When I call you on the phone
You act so unconcerned
I wanna get you all alone
Ooh baby, to show you what I've learned
Why you won't give me the time of day
You won't give me some time
You won't give me anything
God, you think you're too fine
Can't you see?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
All I want is a little time
I've been playing with my toy so much I'm gonna go blind

[Chorus]
Gotta stop, gotta, gotta stop messin' about
You gotta stop, gotta, gotta stop messin' about

Oh yeah

[Outro]
Gotta stop, gotta, gotta stop messin' about
You gotta stop, gotta, gotta stop messin' about
You gotta stop, gotta, gotta stop messin' about
You do it too much
You gotta stop, gotta, gotta stop messin' about
Oo, stop

Control room: No reply, take one!
One two three four, one

This happened once before
When I came to your door no reply
They said it wasn't you
But I saw you peep through your window
I saw the light
I know that you saw me
Cause I looked up to see your face

I tried to telephone
They said you were not home that's a lie
Cause I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door (your face)
I nearly died
Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man
Your face

If I were you I'd realize that I
Love you more than any other guy
And I'll forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply
This happened once before (oh yeah)
When I came to your door no reply
They said it wasn't you
But I saw you peep through-- your face
(It's Hell time, man)
(It's Hell time, man)
(It's Hell time, man)
(It's Hell time, man)

Down these streets the fools rule
There’s no freedom or self respect
A knife’s point or a trip to the joint
Is about all you can expect

They kill people here who stand up for their rights
The system’s just too damned corrupt
It’s always the same, the name of the game
Is who do you know higher up
Well...

(It's Hell time, man)
(It's Hell time, man)
(It's Hell time, man)
(It's Hell time, man)
The blacks and the whites
Steal the other kids’ lives
Wealth is a filthy rag
So erotic so unpatriotic
So wrapped up in the American flag

The witchcraft scum exploiting the dumb
Turns children into crooks and slaves
Whose heroes and healers are real stoned dealers
Who should be put in their graves
Tell the truth now!

(It's Hell time, man)
Well, lookie here, honey
(It's Hell time, man)
(It's Hell time, man)
(It's Hell time, man)

Listen to me Mr. Pusherman
This might be your last night in a bed so soft
There are pimps on the make, politicians on the take
You can’t pay us off

We’re gonna blow up your home of Voodoo
And watch it burn without any regret
We got the power, we’re the new government
You just don’t know it yet
Help me now!

(It's Hell time, man)
Ah, bring it to me honey
(It's Hell time, man)

For all of my brothers from Vietnam
And my uncles from World War II
I’ve got to say that it’s countdown time now
We’re gonna do what the law should do

And for you pretty baby, I know you've seen it all
I know your story is too painful to share
One day though you'll be talking in your sleep
And when you do, I wanna be there

Yeah!

(It's Hell time, man)
Be strong, baby
(It's Hell time, man)
Won't take long, baby
(Band of the hand)
Ah, let me tell you now
(It's Hell time, man)
The war is here, honey
(Band of the hand)
Ah, go ahead now
(It's Hell time, man)
Be strong, baby
(Band of the hand)
It won't be long, honey
(It's Hell time, man)
Be strong, baby

I met a fine beautician
In a very fine condition
She was long and lean
And you know what that means
She's a good lovin' mama
A hard workin' woman
She makes a lot of money
I don't have to worry about a thing

She works hard all day
Dressin' hair
Man you can bet
I want to get somewhere
With my good lovin' mama
My hard workin' woman
She makes a lot of money
I don't have to worry about a thing

I meet the finest woman
From everywhere
Because my baby
Dress their hair
I'll be her lover boy
She treats me like a king
She makes a lot of money
Don't have to worry about a thing
Yes, she keeps her hair
So neat and fine
And every pound of her is mine
I'll be her lover boy
I'll be happy as a king
She makes a lot of money
Don't have to worry about a thing
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
Had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it
You would even say it glows

All of the other reindeer
Used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph
Join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight

Then all the reindeer loved him
And they shouted out with glee
"Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history!"

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say
Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight
Then all the reindeer loved him
And they shouted out with glee
"Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
You'll go down in history!"
I've got the key to the highway
Feel I got to go
Gonna leave here running
Walking is both too slow

I'm going back to the border
Baby where I'm better known
Because you haven't done nothing baby
But draw the good man from home

When the moon peeps over the mountain
Little girl I'll be on my way
I'm gonna roll the highway until the break of day

Oh give me one more kiss darling
Just before I go
Cause when I leave this time little girl
I won't be back no more

I've got the key to the highway
Little darling I got to go
I'm gonna leave here running
Walking is both too slow
They call me the Back Door Santa
I make my runs about the break of day
They call me the Back Door Santa
I make my runs about the break of day
I make all the little girls happy
While the boys are out to play

I ain't like the old Saint Nick
He don't come but once a year
I ain't like the old Saint Nick
He don't come but once a year
I come runnin' with my presents
Every time they call me dear

I keep some change in my pocket
In case the children are home
I give 'em a few pennies so that we can be alone
I leave the back door open so if anybody smells a mouse
And wouldn't old Santa be in trouble if there ain't no
Chimney in the house
They call me the Back Door Santa
I make my runs about the break of day
I make all the little girls happy
While all the boys are out to play

They call me the Back Door Santa
Yeah, that's what they call me
They call me the Back Door Santa
Yeah, that's what they call me

[Verse 1]
I was a midnight rider on a cloud of smoke
I could make a woman hang on every single stroke
I was an iron man, I had a master plan
But I was alone

[Verse 2]
I could hear you breathing with a sigh of the wind
I remember how your body started trembling
Oh, what a night it's been and for the state I'm in
I'm still alone

[Bridge]
And all the wonders made for the earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Somehow I always end up alone (always end up alone)
Always end up alone

[Chorus]
So I play, I'll wait
Cause you know that love takes time
We came so far
Just the beat of a lonely heart
And it's mine
And I don't want to be alone

[Verse 3]
Well, since I got no message on your answer phone
Since you're busy every minute I just stay at home
I make believe you care, I feel you everywhere
But I'm still alone

[Verse 4]
I'm on a wheel of fortune with a twist of fate
Cause I know it isn't heaven, is it love or hate?
Am I the subject of the pain? Am I the stranger in the rain?
I am alone

And if there glory there to behold
Maybe it's my imagination
Another story there to be told

[Chorus]
So I play, I'll wait
And I pray it's not too late
We made it so far
Just a beat of a lonely heart
And it's mine
And I don't want to be alone

[Bridge]
And all the wonders made for the earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Another story there to be told

[Chorus]
So I play, I'll wait
And I pray it's not too late
We made it so far
Just a beat of a lonely heart
And it's mine
And I don't want to be alone

[Outro]
Gone but not out of sight
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home
Face the heat of the night
The one that you love got a heart that's made of stone

Shine and search for the light
And sooner or later you'll be cruising on your ocean
And clean out of sight
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home

Face the heat of the night
The one that you love got a heart that's made of stone

Shine and search for the light
And sooner or later you'll be cruising on your ocean

And clean out of sight
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home

[Verse 1]
It's only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believe in me
Yes, it's only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believe in me

[Bridge]
Without your love
It's a honky-tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade

[Verse 2]
It's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believe in me

[Bridge]
Without your love
It's a honky-tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade

[Outro]
It's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be, yeah
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believe in me

[Verse 1]
Varnished weeds in window jars
Tarnished beads on tapestries
Kept in satin boxes are
Reflections of love's memories

[Verse 2]
Letters from across the seas
Roses dipped in sealing wax
Valentines and maple leaves
Tucked into a paperback

[Chorus 1]
Guess I'll throw them all away
I found someone to love today

[Verse 3]
Dark with darker moods is he
Not a golden prince who's come
Through columbines and wizardry
To talk of castles in the sun

[Chorus 2]
Still I'll take a chance and see
I found someone to love today

[Verse 4]
There's a sorrow in his eyes
Like the angel made of tin
What will happen if I try
To place another heart in him

[Chorus 3]
In a Bleecker Street café
I found someone to love today
I found someone to love today
I need to feel that radio activity
Want you to be the heartbeat inside of me?
Yeah, I need to feel that radio activity
Come with me, this is the sound of the young and free!

I need to feel that radio activity
Want you to be the heartbeat inside of me?
Yeah, I need to feel that radio activity
Come with me, this is the sound of the young and free!

I need to feel that radio activity
Want you to be the heartbeat inside of me?
Yeah, I need to feel that radio activity
Come with me, you'll break the law if you come with me!

This is the sound of the young and free!
Come with me, we'll break the law if you come with me!

[Intro]
Wait a minute
Turn the, turn the phones up
Yeah, cool

[Verse 1]
Lookin' out the window of a big black limousine
Thinkin' 'bout your thighs
Wishin' I was somewhere in between
In one single motion
Deep inside your ocean
I just wanna be

[Chorus]
Underneath the cream
Can't stop thinkin' about ya' thighs
Somewhere in between
That's where I wanna be, that's where I wanna be
Underneath the cream
You and I
Somewhere in between
Your thighs

[Verse 2]
Cell phone, passport
All your inhibitions
Spread out on the floor
(Deep inside)
Deep inside your life-givin' ocean, sugarpop
Rests my consciousness just a little more
Is what I wanna do, babe
So talk to me
Don't get me started
Come into this wet dream-eternal
Pretend I am you and teach me without shame
Take my hand, put it in the place
That turned you out the most last time you came
Useless deliberation, the beast of frustration
Trust me, I know
Somewhere in between seven days and nights
That's how far, baby
You wanna go?

[Chorus]
Underneath the cream
Can't stop thinkin' about ya' thighs
Somewhere in between
That's where I wanna be, that's where I wanna be
Underneath the cream
You and I
Somewhere in between
Your thighs
(Your thighs)

[Verse 3]
Somewhere in between this wet dream, it seems
I never shoulda let you go
Now that you've returned I yearn to learn
All the feelings you never dared to show
Come into this wet dream eternal
Pretend I am you and let's, oh
Somewhere in between, I dream
Underneath the cream

[Outro]
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Whatcha waitin' on baby, tell me
We can do this thing, yeah
Underneath the cream
We need to get right down
'Cause I got something
Groovy groovy groovy
(Groovy underneath the cream)
It's groovy underneath the cream
Underneath the cream

[Intro: Mike]
I don't wanna fight no more baby
Just meet me half way
Help me fellas

[Pre-Chorus]
You say
The things you feel are right
But I feel those things are wrong
And for that we fight all night long

[Verse 1]
There you go
Tripping over the things I say
'Cause things ain't goin your way
Friends say I should leave
But love forces me to stay
I try
Try to give you all of my time
But still I feel denied
When we fuss and fight
I keep asking myself why
Every single day I pray that
Things will turn out right
'Cause where it seems we go problems to arrive
What must we do
Do to make each other see
This realtionship should be
All about me for you and you for me

[Chorus]
You say
The things you feel are right
But I feel those things are wrong
And for that we fight all night long
If you
Knew all the things I knew
Walked around inside my shoes
We can make our love flow all night long

[Verse 2]
What's the deal
Do you ever feel the things that I feel
I'm tryin' to keep our loving for real
Even though it seems we don't seem eye to eye
You know
I never wanna see you go
Your the best I've ever known
So tell me just how long this is gonna take to be
Happy every day and every night just like we should
Cuz to be happy with you all my life I know I could
What must I do
Do to make you trust in me
Is that a possibility
Don't you know that it hurts me when we disagree

[Chorus]
You say
The things you feel are right
But I feel those things are wrong
And for that we fight all night long
If you
Knew all the things I knew
Walked around inside my shoes
We can make our love flow all night long

[Chorus]
You say
The things you feel are right
But I feel those things are wrong
And for that we fight all night long
If you
Knew all the things I knew
Walked around inside my shoes
We can make our love flow all night long

[Bridge]
Baby today
We'll put the past behind
Let's not waste no time
We can do it
Ohhhh
All night long
I like it when you do
Do those things you do (to me)
All night
If you feel

[Interlude: Mike]
Walk with me baby
Don't you wanna do that
Try to meet me half way
I really need you
Huh, are you listening

[Outro]
You say
The things you feel are right
But I feel those things are wrong
And for that we fight all night long
If you
Knew all the things I knew
Walked around inside my shoes
We can make our love flow all night long
Born in a log cabin in the back woods
The back woods of Mississippi
She drank moonshine
Chewed tobacco
Raised 16 children all by herself

Never looked much like a lady
You see mama ruined her body raising her babies
Spent her evenings sitting in a rocking chair
Never had much a nothing but was always willing to share

Talking bout Ma
Talking bout Ma, yeah yeah yeah
Talking bout Ma
Talking bout Ma

Education, nah she didn't have none
Never had a sick day in her life
Stronger than any two good men
Ya better believe it, oh yes she was
Now look a here
When papa died, mama put her love on the shelf
Yes she did
She swore up and down on the good book
She didn't love nobody else
Make sure that we were in church every Sunday
Papa woulda wanted it that way, that she'd always say
Talking bout Ma
Talking bout Ma, yeah yeah yeah
Talking bout Ma
Talking bout Ma

Every once in awhile when ma would get depressed
She'd go to the closet and get Pa's guitar
Set herself down in the rocking chair
Start strumming and humming, ha ha, yeah
That was Ma's way of letting off steam
In plain old English you could see
That ma was doing her thing
Every once in awhile she'd shout
Aaaah, let it all hang out

Talking bout Ma
Talking bout Ma, yeah yeah yeah
Talking bout Ma
Talking bout Ma
Writer(s): Cahn/Chaplin/Freeman/Holiner

Don't you know I'd work for you, I'd slave for you
Be a beggar or a knave for you
If that isn't love it will have to do
Until the real thing comes along

Gladly move the earth for you
Prove my love dear, and it's worth for you
If that isn't love it'll have to do
Until the real thing comes along

With all the words dear at my command
I just can't make you understand
I'll always love you baby - come what may
My heart is yours - what more can I say

I would cry for you, even sigh for you
Tear those stars down from the sky for you
If that isn't love it'll have to do
Until the real thing comes along
Walk on burning coals for you
I would drive the Chrysler,leave the Rolls for you
If that ain't love it will have to do
Until the real thing comes along

I would try to hit high "C" for you
I'd even punch out Mr. T for you
If that ain't love it will have to do
Until the real thing comes along

There's not a thing that you can't ask of me
Go on, demand any task of me
If you want the moon or a lavaliere
All you got to do is nibble on my ear

I would rob, steal, beg, borrow, and lie for you
Lay my little body down and die for you
(If that ain't love - if that isn't love)
If that ain't love it will have to do
Until the real thing comes along
Never more aware of what you do
I got you leavin' me and missing you
And me believing that you've never done right
When you've never done wrong

You been comin' to me late at night
It's not the eye alone that gives you sight
I've never given anybody my soul
But I'm coming undone

I'm a survivor but I'm reaching my low
But I'm not ready to die

I'm here for the kiss of life
I'm here for the kiss of life
Just give me the kiss of life

Watch them hold you
Count their faces
A never-ending line
But they're only imitations
Existing out of time
So now you're telling me it's just a ring
You say it's nothing but it's everything

I'm under pressure and I'm under
Your gun and I'm fingers and thumbs

You got the questions and the answers
I know
I'm being buried alive

I'm here for the kiss of life
I'm here for the kiss of life
Just give me the kiss of life

I can't stay here
Lost without you
Strangers in the dark
Holyangel
Living for you
To love and never cry

I'm a survivor but I'm reaching my low
But I'm not ready to die

I'm here for the kiss of life
I'm here for the kiss of life
Just give me the kiss of life
I sure got the blues this morning, baby
Yeah! And I’m here to tell you about it
So you might as well pick up on it!
I’m a man
At least I’m tryin’ to be
I’ve lived before
The other half of me
I’ve lived before
That you don’t want me
But in this search
For nothing desperately
Oh, I’m tryin’ tryin’
Not to be a fool
I’m tryin’ tryin’
Lord to keep my cool, baby tryin’ so hard to keep it together

After I find, baby
That true love of mine
I’m just rollin’ screamin’
Cryin’ flyin’
Can’t be trusted, but busted
Rolling Stone
You’re a woman
At least you say you are
You’re a woman
At least you look like you are
You’re a woman
At least you taste like you are
But you can take it off
In bed with my guitar
And then you leave them
Throw me outside
To cry, cry
To the moon and the nighttime
Save my soul
You can’t find
All you want is a ticket to ride
After you show me everything
It did prove otherwise
You just rollin’, screamin’, cryin’ good love is sometime, but can’t be trusted
Steppin’ Stone
Steppin’ Stone
Steppin’ Stone
Bright lights of the city are starting to wear me down
And when I need you, you just can't be found
Loud days, endless nights, starting to make me crazy
And now you're gone, there's nothing left for me

[Hollywood]
I don't care for sunny weather

[Ain't that good]
I like the change of seasons better

[Knock on wood]
I love the feel of rain upon my face

[Hollywood]

[Hollywood]
No, and I don't care if the snow comes down

[Ain't that good]
Kick the fallen leaves around

[Knock on wood]
Got to move to some other kind of town

[Hollywood]
Wonderful to know you, great to know you care
As I look back at the crazy things we've shared
I was dancing by the moonlight, blinded by neon light
And as I look back it never could be right

[Hollywood]
I don't care for sunny weather

[Ain't that good]
I like the change of seasons better

[Knock on wood]
I love the feel of rain upon my face

[Hollywood]

[Hollywood]
No, and I don't care if the snow comes down

[Ain't that good]
Kick the fallen leaves around

[Knock on wood]
Got to move to some other kind of town

[Hollywood]

Well I was dancing by the moonlight, blinded by neon lights
And now I see it never could be right

[Hollywood]
I don't care for sunny weather

[Ain't that good]
I like the change of seasons better

[Knock on wood]
I love the feel of rain upon my face

[Hollywood]

[Hollywood]
No, and I don't care if the snow comes down

[Ain't that good]
Kick the fallen leaves around

[Knock on wood]
Got to move to some other kind of town

[Hollywood]

Some other kind of town

[Hollywood]
I don't care for sunny weather

[Ain't that good]
I like the change of seasons better

[Knock on wood]
I love the feel of rain upon my face

[Hollywood]

[Hollywood]
No, and I don't care if the snow comes down

[Ain't that good]
Kick the fallen leaves around

[Knock on wood]
Got to move to some other kind of town

[Hollywood]
Some other kind of town

Some other kind of town

Some other kind of town

Some other kind of town

Some other kind of town

Some other kind of town

Some other kind of town

Some other kind of town

Some other kind of town

[FIRST PART:]

Winter rain, now tell me why
Summers fade, and roses die
The answer came
The wind and rain

Golden hills, now veiled in gray
Summer leaves have blown away
Now what remains? The wind and rain

And like a desert spring
My lover comes and spreads her wings (flowing)
Like a song that's born to soar the sky (flowing)
Flowing 'till the waters all are dry (flowing)
The loving in her eyes

Circle songs and sands of time
And seasons will end in tumbled rhyme
And little change
The wind and rain
And like a desert spring
My lover comes and spreads her wings (flowing)
Like a song that's born to soar the sky (flowing)
Flowing 'till the rivers all are dry (flowing)
The loving in her eyes

(Winter gray and falling rain)
(We'll see summer come again)
(Darkness falls and seasons change)
Gonna happen every time
(Same old friends the wind and rain
We'll see summer by and by
Summers fade and roses die
(You'll see summer come again)
Like a song that's born to soar the sky

[SECOND PART, "LET IT GROW":]

Morning comes, she follows the path to the river shore
Lightly sung, her song is the latch on the morning's door
See the sun sparkle in the reeds, silver beads, pass into the sea

She comes from a town where they call her the woodcutter's daughter
She's brown as the bank where she kneels down to gather her water
And she bears it away with a love that the river has taught her
Let it flow, greatly grow, wide and clear!

Round and round, the cut of the plow in the furrowed field
Seasons round, the bushels of corn and the barley meal
Broken ground, open and beckoning to the spring
Black dirt live again!

The plowman is broad as the back of the land he is sowing
As he dances the circular track of the plow ever knowing
That the work of his day measures more than the planting and growing

Let it grow, let it grow, greatly yield!

What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

So it goes, we make what we make since the world began
Nothing more, the love of the women, the work of men
Seasons round, creatures great and small
Up and down as we rise and fall

What shall we say, shall we call it by a name?
As well to count the angels dancing on a pin
Water bright as the sky from which it came
And the name is on the earth that takes it in
We will not speak but stand inside the rain
And listen to the thunder shout "I am! I am! I am! I am!"

[Verse 1]
Talkin', talkin' to the people
Try, get them to go your way
Tellin' lies, not to worry
That we won't be led astray
So blind, unsignified
Your opponents always lying
Think about the mistakes you make
I believe America's at stake

[Chorus]
You know, busin', busin' is the issue
Do you have a plan wager? Woo
If, if you have a plan, ah
If you have a master plan
I got to, got to vote for you
Hey, hey, got to vote for you
You're the man, woo
(You're the man, you're the man)
Woo (You're the man, you're the man)

[Verse 2]
We don't wanna hear no more lies
About how you planned a compromise
We want our dollar value increased
That employment to, to rise
The nation's taxation
Is causin' all, all of this inflation
Don't give us no peace sign
Turn around, rob the people blind

[Chorus]
Economics is the issue
Do you have a plan wager?
'Cause if you've got a master plan
Got to vote for you
You're the man

[Bridge]
Don't you understand?
There's misery in the land
Don't you understand?
There's misery in the land
Don't you understand?
There's misery in the land
Don't you understand?
There's misery in the land
Don't you understand?
There's misery in the land
Don't you understand?
There's misery in the land
Don't you understand?
There's misery in the land
Don't you understand?
There's misery in the land (Woo)

[Verse 3]
People marching on Washington
Why not hear what they have to say
Because the tables just might turn against you, brother
Set around Election Day
Politics and hypocrites
Is turning us all into lunatics
Can you take the guns from our sons?
Right all the wrong this administration's done?

[Chorus]
Peace and freedom is the issue, oh
Do you have a plan wager?
'Cause if you've got the plan, if you've got the master plan
I got to vote for you, hey, hey, got to vote for you
'Cause you're the man

[Outro]
Vote for you (Hey, you're the man)
Got to vote for you (I got to vote for you)
Got to vote for you, got to vote for you (Woo)
Got to vote for you, got to vote for you
Got to vote for you, got to vote for you
Got to vote for you, got to vote for you
See my chain stoopid and my ring stoopid
Girl I'm not stoopid but my knot stoopid
All sets stoopids, BBS stoopids
Girl it's Gucci, Gucci and my diamond's fruity

See my chain stoopid and my ring stoopid
Girl I'm not stoopid but my knot stoopid
All sets stoopids, BBS stoopids
Girl it's Gucci, Gucci and my diamond's fruity

Send on my jacky baby, call her terry bracelet baby
Bart one was spent 'bout 20 G, Gucci drop three eighty baby
Multicolor carrot tee, my necklaces are heavy mane
Hit the club then leave the club then come back with another chain

Mighty mouse is icy dog, Bart shit is just stupid
Yellow, blue, black, green and white, the diamonds match the groupies
Digitally enhance stones, pink is like a movie
Truly I'm a walkin' lick, Gucci man the talkin' brick

If you ain't gonna talk to chickens dog who you talkin' to?
7:30 in the kitchen, Nate, Nate about to go to school
Saturday I'm cookin' chickens, momma about to go to work

See my chain stoopid and my ring stoopid
Girl I'm not stoopid but my knot stoopid
All sets stoopids, BBS stoopids

Heavy wrist activity got me livin' lovely
Cocka nina, heaven land, cocka nina shawty
Breakin' down ten chickens, dog about to cook the shake up
All these extra grams might as well go buy a Jacob

Gucci man for mayor, Gucci man so player
Repin' East Atlanta, that's ten minutes from Decatur
Almost match are cars and are belts going to match are gators
You can't swang like Gucci 'cause you don't got enough flavor

Heavy on the lickerish, industry ridiculous
Bitches I'm magnificent, I'm not very articulate

Gucci what's the penalty, shawty what's the business
Every night is Valentine, every day is Christmas
Gucci what's the penalty, shawty what's the business
Every night is Valentine, every day is Christmas
See my chain stoopid and my ring stoopid
Girl I'm not stoopid but my knot stoopid

My girlfriend say she love me but it's just the jewelry
Multicolor carrots got your girlfriend kinda curious
First I drop my verses and then I go and drop the chorus
Then I'm out the booth back to my trap, you know I'm mournin'

'74 restored it, Beethoven recorded
Say you charging 30 like that Gucci can't afford it
Gucci chargin' 40 dog, that's a couple birdies
Gucci stoopid jewelry dog, I don't think you herd me

See my chain stoopid and my ring stoopid
Girl I'm not stoopid but my knot stoopid
All sets stoopids, BBS stoopids

Whoa...whoaa...whaooaaa
My lady soul

Laying here beside you
Close as we can be
I know what this leads to
I know what you need. yeah

I'm ready to surrender
My love, lay it all in your hands
Give you my forever
Everything I am

'Cause you are my, my, my, my lady soul
You warm my heart when I go cold
Oh you are my, my, my, my lady soul
You are my life, you make me whole

Whoa
My lady soul
I feel it in your heartbeat
Hear it in your cries
This is where our hearts meet
I see it in your eyes

I've been waiting for this moment
My love, it's a dream come alive
Heaven must have sent me
An angel of the night

'Cause you are my, my, my, my lady soul
You warm my heart when I go cold
'Cause you are my, you're my, you're my, my lady soul
You're my lady soul
You are my life, you make me whole

Hmm, I've always knew we end up together
Right from the very start
And I believe we will make it forever
It's written right here in my heart
Oh yeah

You're my, you're my, my lady soul
You warm my heart when I get cold
Oh, you are my, my, my, my lady soul
You are my life, you make me whole
Whoa
My lady soul

Ooo (my, my)
Ooo (my, my)
My, my, my, my, my, my, my
(my, my) my lady soul

[Verse 1]
Well, they traveled over hills and mountains
On a cold December night just like this
For they knew what was going to happen
Mary would give birth to the Prince of Peace
Our Lord

[Verse 2]
From the manger what they saw in the distance
Was a misty silhoutte of three kings
Bringing all the most prescious jewels to our savior
Knowing he would soon be called the King of Kings
Our Lord

[Bridge]
On Christmas day
They saw a star in the east and followed it
On Christmas day
That marked the birthplace of our Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ
All free from sin
Here to give us a chance at everlasting life again
So the world
So cold you better let him in
To your heart, yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 3]
From the sight of the blessed child was full of beauty
As they looked upon the one who would save our world
To their knees they dropped and started to worship
Giving thanks to God above for the Prince of Peace
Our Lord

[Verse 4]
No one knew back then that on that evening
That the miracle of miracles came true
That a God above would come down from heaven
In the form of a child
That would set us free
Our Lord
Once there was a thing called spring
When the world was writing verses like yours and mine
All the lads and girls would sing
When we sat at little tables and drank May wine
Now April, May, and June are sadly out of tune
Life has stuck a pin in the balloon
Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?
No desire, no ambition leads me
Maybe it's because nobody needs me?
Spring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?
Stars appear! Why doesn't the night invite me?
Maybe it's because nobody loves me
Spring is here, I hear!
And so it goes

We mouth your words when your tongues are too paralyzed
We finish up the peanut butter jelly that you get on your router but never eat

We still pee in bottles
We play at your graduation parties
We have fallen comrades
We just rebuild the team

Our friends are rich and we love it
Cause it makes us look wealthy too
Shit, I still got a Sidekick 1 with a crack in the fucking screen man

We were your favorite "I'm the first person to know about these guys" band
We dance to "Use Me" by Bill Winters in a drunken stupor or two
Until Ma and Gary to tell us to go the fuck home and kick us out

We make mistakes, we love, we hate
We're not angry anymore though
Still miss you, still love you
Like a slug hates salt and we're still your heroes

[Verse 1]
Hot winds and hunger cries, Ethiopia
Flies in your babies' eyes, Ethiopia
Walking sticks on burning plains
Betrayed by politics, abandoned by the rains

[Chorus 1]
On and on, the human need
On and on, the human greed profanes
Ethiopia, Ethiopia, Ethiopia

[Verse 2]
Your topsoil flies away, Ethiopia
We pump ours full of poison spray, Ethiopia
Between the brown skies and sprinkling lawns
I hear the whine of chainsaws hacking rainforests down

[Chorus 2]
On and on, insanities
On and on, short-sighted greed abounds
Ethiopia, Ethiopia, Ethiopia

[Bridge]
Little garden planet, oasis in space
Some hearts hurt, they can hardly stand it
Famine phantoms at the garden gates
Ethiopia, Ethiopia, Ethiopia

[Verse 3]
Every Sunday on TV, Ethiopia
You suffer with such dignity, Ethiopia
A TV star with a PR smile
Calls your baby "it" while strolling through your tragic trials

[Chorus 3]
On and on, stupidity
On and on, the basic needs are defiled
Good air, good water, good earth
Ethiopia, Ethiopia, Ethiopia

[Outro]
Little garden planet, oasis in space
Some hearts hurt, they can hardly stand the waste
Ethiopia, Ethiopia, Ethiopia
It's my own fault, baby
Treat me the way you wanna do

It's my own fault, baby
Treat me the way you wanna do
Yes when you were loving me, baby (woman)
At that time, little girl, I didn't love you

She used to make her own pay checks
And bring them all home to me
I would go out on the hillside, you know
And make every woman look I see

It's my own fault, baby
Treat me the way you wanna do
Yes when you were loving me, baby (woman)
At that time, little girl, I didn't love you

She said she was gonna leave me
She'd been running around with the boys
She said she was gonna leave me
Gonna be over in Illinois
It's my own fault, baby
Treat me the way you wanna do
Yes when you were loving me, baby (woman)
At that time, little girl, I didn't love you
Everything is settled, immovable and calm
Nothing that has plagued our lives can ever do us harm
Then the voices railed against us, then the path was steep
Now the sounds are softer, now the road is ended
In your arms, I'll sleep

Turn away from madness, burn the inner light
Pray for me as cheerfully as I slip into the night
Death is just a visitor watching for a while
Sullen and predictable, love is versatile

Everything is peaceful, and falling into place
I no longer feel the wounds suffered in the chase
Then we were at turns divided, then by turns oppressed
Now the pain is over, now we lie together
Gratefully at rest

Put aside the notion that the end is near
Stay with me eternally, the terrors disappear
Death is just a messenger in a poor disguise
Fooling no one, lost for words, love is in your eyes
Now we know as we are known, unimagined things
Death is just the messenger, love the truth it brings

[Verse 1]
My death waits like an old roué
So confident I'll go his way
Whistle to him and the passing time
My death waits like a bible truth
At the funeral of my youth
We drank for that and the passing time
My death waits like a witch at night
As surely as our love is bright
Let's not think of that or the passing time

[Chorus]
But whatever lies behind the door
There is nothing much to do
Angel or devil, I don't care
For, in front of that door
There is you

[Verse 2]
My death waits like a beggar blind
Who sees the world through an unlit mind
Throw him a dime for the passing time
My death waits to allow my friends
A few good times before it ends
Let's not think about the passing time
My death waits there between your thighs
Your cool fingers will close my eyes
Let's not think about the passing time

[Chorus]
But what ever lies behind the door
There is nothing much to do
Angel or devil, I don't care
For, in front of that door
There is you

[Verse 3]
My death waits there, among the leaves
In magician's mysterious sleeves
Rabbits and dogs and the passing time
My death waits there among the flowers
Where the blackest shadow cowers
So let's pick lilacs for the passing time
My death waits there, in a double bed
Sails of oblivion at my head
Let's not think about the passing time

[Chorus]
But whatever lies behind the door
There is nothing much to do
Angel or devil, I don't care
For, in front of that door
There is you
It's safe in the city to love in a doorway
Wrangle some screams from the dawn
And isn't it me, putting pain in a stranger?
Like a portrait in flesh, trails on a leash
Will you see that I'm scared and I'm lonely?
So I'll break up my room, and yawn and I'll
Run to the center of things
Where the knowing one says:
Boys, boys, its a sweet thing
Boys, boys, its a sweet thing, sweet thing
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
'Cause hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing"
I'm glad that you're older than me
Makes me feel important and free
Does that make you smile, isn't that me?
I'm in your way, and I'll steal every moment
If this trade is a curse, then I'll bless you
And turn to crossroads and hamburgers
Boys, boys, its a sweet thing
Boys, boys, its a sweet thing, sweet thing
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
'Cause hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing"
I'll make you a deal, like any other candidate
We'll pretend we're walking home 'cause your future's at stake
My set is amazing, it even smells like a street
There's a bar at the end where I can meet you and your friend
Someone scrawled on the wall "I smell the blood of les tricoteuses"
Who wrote up scandals in other bars
I'm having so much fun with the poisonous people
Spreading rumors and lies and stories they made up
Some make you sing and some make you scream
One makes you wish that you'd never been seen
But there's a shop on the corner that's selling papier mache
Making bullet-proof faces; Charlie Manson, Cassius Clay
"If you want it, boys, get it here, thing"
So you scream out of line:
"I want you! I need you! Anyone out there? Any time?"
Tres butch little number whines "Hey dirty, I want you
When it's good, it's really good, and when it's bad I go to pieces"
If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
Well, on the street where you live I could not hold up my head
For I put all I have in another bed
On another floor, in the back of a car
In the cellar of a church with the door ajar
Well, I guess we must be looking for a different kind
But we can't stop trying 'til we break up our minds
'Til the sun drips blood on the seedy young knights
Who press you on the ground while shaking in fright
I guess we could cruise down one more time
With you by my side, it should be fine
We'll buy some drugs and watch a band
Then jump in the river holding hands

[Part Three: Sweet Thing (Reprise)]
"If you want it, boys, get it here, thing
'Cause hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing"
Is it nice in your snow storm, freezing your brain?
Do you think that your face looks the same?
Then let it be, it's all I ever wanted
It's a street with a deal, and a taste
It's got claws, it's got me, it's got you ...
I don't look for no worries, worries and troubles come around
I don't look for no worries, worries and troubles come around
World keep on turning, I got to keep my feet on the ground

Nobody saw me cryin', nobody knows the way I feel
Nobody saw me cryin', nobody knows the way I feel
The way I love the woman, that bound to get me killed

Loved the little girl so good, she made my low down butter come
I loved the little girl so good, she made my low down butter come
I need the woman so bad, I need her like the sky need the sun
One, two, three

Now I'll tell you plainly baby, what I plan to do
Say I may be crazy woman, but I ain't no fool
Your daddy's rich mama, you're overdue
Now I ain't the one baby, been messin' with you
Got bells in your mind lady, and it's easy to see-uh
I think it's time for me to move along, I do believe

Aww, you're tryin' to put a hook in me, baby, oh, no

Now you're talkin' jive woman, when you say to me
That your daddy's gonna take us in baby, take care of me
You know and I know woman, I ain't the one
I never hurt you sweetheart, I never pulled my gun
Got bells in your mind mama, and it's easy to see-uh
I think it's time for me to move along, I do believe

Time for me to put my boots out in the street missy
Are you ready boots?
Walk on!
Well now alright there missy
Let me tell you a thing or two
How about it baby?

Now you're talkin' jive woman, when you say to me
That your daddy's gonna take us in baby, take care of me
You know and I know woman, I ain't the one
I never hurt you sweetheart, I never pulled my gun
Got bells in your mind mama, and it's easy to see-uh
I think it's time for me to move along, I do believe

Oh, I must be in the middle of some kinda conspiracy

Ohhh, nooo!

Wooooo!
I feel weak, things get tough
Sometimes my knees can barely hold me up
I'm no fool, but it's said
You gotta walk a mile 'til you're outta my head
Come within, taste it up
Take a little bit and baby don't you give up
Cast your light, give a damn
You gotta make a move and show me where we can stand
Lay me down in darkness
Tell me what you see
Love is where the heart is
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
(Come on)
Lay me down in darkness
Tell me what you see
Love is where the heart is
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
(Come on)
Tell me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
Tell me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
I got the time, it'll be alright, yeah, I got the time
That you need (Yeah)
We all weep, bleed the same
If you get the picture, leave it outta the frame
In the now, take a chance
Make a mess, and don't forget that life is a dance
Come within, taste it up
Take a little bit and baby don't you give up
Cast your light, give a damn
You gotta make a move and show me where we can stand
Lay me down in darkness
Tell me what you see
Love is where the heart is
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
(Come on)
Lay me down in darkness (Yeah)
Tell me what you see
Love is where the heart is
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
Show me I'm the one tell me I'm the one that you need
(Yeah)
Show me I'm the one tell me I'm the one that you need
Show me I'm the one tell me I'm the one that you need
Show me I'm the one tell me I'm the one that you need
Mmmm-mmm me, show me baby baby tell me that's me, yeah
I got the time, it'll be alright, yeah
I got the time that you need. Come on!

[Intro: Rihanna]
I guess they know I'm bad, bad
I got a problem
I need you to solve it

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Shopaholic's what they call 'em
My addiction, my prescription
Gimme shoes and give me bags
How much you want? I need 'em bad

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
All them girls be checking my bags
While they be biting my swag
I guess they know I'm bad, bad (bad)

[Chorus: Rihanna]

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
All them girls be checking my bags
While they be bitin' my swag (yeah)
I guess they know I'm bad, bad (bad, bad, bad)

[Verse 3: Chris Brown & (Rihanna)]
She a bad girl, a real shopaholic
She buying everything up, man, I can't call it
And she a walking store, I'm talking 'bout her clothes
I just pause, I'm in awe, 'cause she a fashion show
Real Louis bags and breathe Gucci
Got a wardrobe like she's staring in a movie
And she ain't even famous but she got her own groupies
She got her own groupies
Said she got her own groupies (bad)

[Chorus: Rihanna]
What a bad little girl I am (I got a problem) (bad bad)
What a bad little girl I am (I need you to solve it) (bad bad)
What a bad little girl I am
Bad bad bad bad bad bad

What a bad little girl I am
Bad bad bad bad bad bad

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
There was nobody left
Just a burnout nothing had been done
It was hard to believe
We had started out that morning having fun

[Chorus]
But with people always running into walls
Like they didn't even see them there at all
Got so tangled
Thanks again for your moonlight generousness
Left me strangling
Slowly in the west

[Verse 2]
Don't worry mama your sweet daughter
Who lived inside this mess
Though I tried to protect her
Cool her and ease her restlessness

[Chorus]
Grew so used to the sound of her alarm
Didn't mean to do her any harm
Got so tangled
Please forgive me for my constant uselessness
Got me strangled
Slowly in the west

[Verse 3]
Let me loose let me hear the sound of someone
Through this haze
Take me there I don't care anywhere it's all the same

So honey don't hold your breath
You may never get to feel this way again
Who was crying when she left
Lying to you now about the pain
Our baby can't be gotten back no
It was an end to her madness I've been told

[Chorus]
Got so tangled
Please just show me to the ending
Forget the rest
Got me strangled
Slowly in the west

[Verse 1]
I met a young soldier, he said his name was Killer Kyle
He was shaking all over like a night-frightened child
This is his story, it's a tough one for me to sing
Hard as the squawk and the flap
And the beat of, the beat of black wings

[Chorus]
Johnny Angel
Johnny Angel
Johnny Angel

[Verse 2]
They gave me a gun, he said, they gave me a mission
For the power and the glory, propaganda, piss on 'em
There's a war zone inside me, I can feel things exploding
I can't even hear the fucking music playing
For the beat of, the beat of black wings

[Chorus]
Johnny Angel
Johnny Angel
Johnny Angel

[Verse 3]
He said, I never had nothin', nothin' I could believe in
My girl killed our unborn child without even grieving
I put my hands on her belly to feel the kid kicking
Damn, she'd been to some clinic
Oh, the beat of black wings

[Chorus]
Johnny Angel
Johnny Angel
Johnny Angel

[Verse 4]
They want you, they need you, they train you to kill
To be a pin on some map some vicarious thrill
The old hate the young, that's the whole heartless thing
The old pick the wars, we die in 'em
To the beat of, the beat of black wings

[Chorus]
Johnny Angel
Johnny Angel
Johnny Angel

[Verse 5]
There's a man drawing pictures on the sidewalk with chalk
Just as fast as he draws 'em, rain come down and wash 'em off
Keep the drinks comin', girl, 'til I can't feel anything
I'm just a chalk mark in a rainstorm
I'm just the beat of black wings

[Chorus]
Johnny Angel
Johnny Angel
Johnny Angel
(Bow bow)
(I'm the Pied Piper)
(Bow bow bow bow bow)
(In the radio)

Then the prince heard something he never knew could be
The hidden Pied Piper was laughing
As the prince moved his head back and forth with the music going on
When the music died down the Piper said that "every night
After midnight if you leave your on your transistor radio
I'll promise to bring more magic music to you
No one" he said " will ever believe you so why tell of me to anyone?

You are my only friend of night" said the Pied Piper "and I'll talk to
You again some night"
Then the radio was glowing no more
As it fell into the hands of the fascinated prince
He ran back amazed and he hopped right back into bed

That night he dreamt all night
Mostly about his radio and his friend the Pied Piper
The prince did try what the Piper said to do
But for weeks at night
He heard nothing like the music of that magic night

"That Pied Piper must have been joking" he said
"There's nothing but Bach on this radio
I'm gonna throw it back up in the attic for good"
This he sat disbelieving the young prince so loud
That two of his brothers overheard him
The next day those two brothers took the radio from the attic and turned
It on

(Lorrie)
How do you keep the music playing, how do you make it last
How do keep the song from fading too fast
How do you lose yourself to someone, and never lose your way
How do you not run out of new things to say

(Frank)
My funny Valentine
Sweet comic Valentine
You make me smile with my heart
(Lorrie)
And since you know we're always changing
(Frank)
Your looks are laughable
(Lorrie)
How can it be the same
(Frank)
Unphotographable
Yet you're my favourite work of art

(Lorrie)
You're sure your heart will fall apart, each time you hear her name
(Frank)
Is your figure less than Greek
Is your mouth a little weak
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?
(Lorrie)
If we can be the best of lovers, yet be the best of friends
If we can try with every day, to make it better as it goes
(Frank)
Don't you change one hair for me
Not if you care for me
(Both)
Stay little Valentine, please stay

(Lorrie)
With any luck than I suppose, the music never ends
(Frank)
Each day is Valentine's, Valentine's Day

(Frank)
Winter time
(Lorrie)
Winter time
(Frank)
Summer time
(Lorrie)
Summer time
(Frank)
Evening time
(Lorrie)
Evening time
(Frank)
Or any time
(Both)
I love you

[Chorus]
I know that I need her (Huh)
But don't know how to treat her (Huh)
But you deserve better, baby, better, baby, better, baby
You deserve better, baby, better, baby, better, baby
Though I wanna keep her (Huh)
Be jealous if she leave, uh (Huh)
But you deserve better, baby, better, baby, better, baby
You deserve better, baby, better, baby, better, baby
And I can't hold you back, baby

[Verse 1]
Damn, I think I love her, but I don't really know her good
Know I wanna fuck her, but really thinking if I should
How can I believe her? I don't even believe myself
Tell me how to trust her, I can't even trust myself
And I can't live alone, at the end of the day, can't fuck myself
I told her I'm confused and she told me to go fuck myself
Now I'm alone in this world, nothing left but me
But I was born all alone, so I guess that's how it's meant to be
But she was sent to me, and I didn't recognize
And I blame it on my pride on the fact I'm sittin' in silence
Eyes redder than a rose, heart bluer than a violet
My heart broke and I'm heartless and ain't no need to hide it
Gucci

[Chorus]
I know that I need her (Huh)
But don't know how to treat her (Huh)
But you deserve better, baby, better, baby, better, baby
You deserve better, baby, better, baby, better, baby
Though I wanna keep her (Huh)
Be jealous if she leave, uh (Huh)
But you deserve better, baby, better, baby, better, baby
You deserve better, baby, better, baby, better, baby
And I can't hold you back, baby

[Verse 2]
A heart breaking is heart broke
I'ma tell the truth 'cause we grown folks
Why you lookin' through my phone for?
That's why we ended up none more
You don't know me like John Doe
Done left me up in my condo
Looking for you like Waldo, my nose open like Gunzo
I think I love her I don't know
I like her a lot, but she loco
She crazy, swagged out
I try to hug her she want more
In and out of town all the time
She in and out my mind all the time
I can't lie baby girl stupid fine
But I'm out the tush got that stupid grind
She loves me now or she loves me not
Treat me cold or she treat me hot
Caramel, but not apricot
Got one chance, won't miss the shot
I know she special, yeah, a lot
I know someone might take ma spot
Can't lie, it may hurt a lot
But uh, she need a man or not (It's Gucci)

[Chorus]
I know that I need her (Huh)
But don't know how to treat her (Huh)
But you deserve better, baby, better, baby, better, baby
You deserve better, baby, better, baby, better, baby
Though I wanna keep her (Huh)
Be jealous if she leave, uh (Huh)
But you deserve better, baby, better, baby, better, baby
You deserve better, baby, better, baby, better, baby
And I can't hold you back, baby
If you're drivin' down the road and you come across an old man
Holdin' out his thumb in the wind
His clothes are old and dirty and dirty that doesn't matter
It's his eyes that tell where he's been
If you're not afraid to take your chances on a stranger
He might have some company to lend
Why don't you pull off to the side and let that old man have a ride
He can tell you all the crazy things he's seen

I'm an old hitchhiker
The highway is the only home I know
Where you're headed I don't mind
I ain't been there in some time
And it's just exactly where I want to go

I can tell you how I started in the circus as a barker
Drawin' people in from far and wide
They never did regret the dollar that it cost ‘em
We always left ‘em feelin' good inside
We were headed for Montana when we hired us a dancer
Her beauty it was more than I can say
Then one summer night she set my soul on fire
Lord, I wish that she was here with me today
I'm an old hitchhiker, I wonder what's a waitin' ‘round the bend
I don't know what I might see and I don't need no guarantee
Just a ride from here to there and back again

I was only seventeen when I took the open highway
Took it for my teacher and a friend
I've been thirty years a-thumbin'
Some might call it bummin'
But it's better than just cryin' in the wind
So if you're drivin' down the road and you come across an old man holdin' out his thumb in the rain
Why don't you pull off to the side let the poor boy have a ride
He can tell you all the crazy things he's seen

I'm an old hitchhiker lookin' to the far side of the hill
Some people say I'll settle down
Build a home in some small town
But within my heart I know I never will

I'm an old hitchhiker
TEASPOON! come here come here, hey, hey, hey look
Hey go get me two pounds of bud and two ounces of yay
Muthafuckaz at mah house waitin right now cuz
Aiight

How long can sell?

Before I have to go to jail
(you gotta hike the ball and just make something happen man)
Can I possibley get real?
(I mean you know you might get tackeled you know what im saying)
Before somebody go and snitch
(then again you might fuck around and make a touch down)
I'm so paranoid stressed stressed paranoid paranoid
One false move I can be destroyed (echo)
I avoid the cops I use a decoy
See my mother fuckin driver he's a white boy
I'm so paranoid stressed stressed paranoid paranoid one false move
I can be destroyed to avoid the cops I use a decoy
You see my mother fuckin driver he's a white boy
All my life I did nothin' but dealin'
Learned to rely on my gut feelin'
Yo name is what? what? I know you from where? where?
I dont meen to seem vicious but you look suspicious
Stop talking bout drugs on the telephone
Stop walking with a bunch of thugs to my home
Stop fuckin up, call me before you come
Stop telling these bitches where you got it from
How long can I sell
The sheriff departments right down the block
Before I have to go to jail
Pass my beer so I can swallow this rock
Can I possibley get real
Pass the tabs the turnakit and syringes
Before somebody go snitch
Before the DEA kick the door of the hinges
I'm so paranoid stressed stressed paranoid pranoid
One false move I can be destroyed (echo)
I avoid the cops I use a decoy
You see my mother fuckin driver he's a white boy
I'm so paranoid stressed stressed paranoid paranoid
One false move I can be destroyed (echo)
I avoid the cops I use a decoy
You see my mother fuckin driver he's a white boy

As I bail down the street with my khakis creased
Everybody looking at me look like the police
Havin conversations with my gang asailants
Do you think we under police surveilance
Asking questions giving suggestions
Pulling smith an wessons on strange pedestrians
Cookin crack up, dolla bills stacked up
Hope the cops dont backup here they come man
How long
Stop runnin stop runnin
Can I sell
The sheriff departments right down the block
Before I have to go to jail
Pass my beer so I can swallow this rock
Can I possibly get real
Hurry up pass the tabs turnakit and syringes
Before somebody go and snitch
Before the DEA kick the door off the hinges
Maybe I otta stop sellin water
Spend more time with my son and my daughter
But my drug life drug me away from my wife
She couldn't deal with the stress and the strife
The cocaine rockin' and the hood rats jockin'
The late night knockin' the drive way blockin'
Late at night I fantasize bout rappin
But I gotta sell dope till it happen
For how long

Hey who is that who is that man?
See you all fuckin up
I got these looks
Yo man little rich kids comin over here
Thats what I'm saying now
You know the gonna snitch

What the fuck you think they gonna do when the police presure em?
Get to crying and shit..afroman sold it to me mommy
He stays over there
How long can I sell
The sheriff departments right down the block
Before I have to got to jail
Pass my beer so iI can swallow this rock
Can I possibley get real
Pass the tabs turnakit and syringes
Before somebody go and snitch
Before the DEA kick the door of the hinges
I'm so paranoid
Now god lay me down to sleep
Before the cops rape
Please give me a beat
If they accidently kill me
And I dont escape
Pray some white person
Gotta video tape

Twinkle twinkle little little star (echo)
That looks like a police car (echo)
Shining on my dope spot (echo)
A police raid (echo)
I hope not (echo)
Little little homie hold my gun (echo)
Im gonna fuckin run (echo)
Where I run, I dont care
Throw that dope, anywhere (echo)
Cops chase me, through the hood
Straight in to the woods camera
Fly like leapords
I hear, german sheapards
Freeze, hold It right there
Drug dealers, nightmare
Busted crack, criminal court
No black support
Handcuffs very tight, baptist jury all white
They could never, be my peers, sentence me twenty years
This rap so damn real, Im glad I gotta record deal
If I don't sell a mill
This could could happen still
What a predicament
When an irresistible force such as you
Meets an old immovable object like me
You can bet just as sure as you live
Somethin's gotta give
Somethin's gotta give
Somethin's gotta give

When an irrepressible smile such as yours
Warms an old implacable heart such as mine
Don't say no, because I insist
Somewhere, somehow, someone's gotta be kissed

So, en garde, who knows what the fates might have in store?
From their vast mysterious sky?
I'll try hard ignorin' those lips that I adore
But how long can anyone try?

Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight it with all of our might
Chances are some heavenly star-spangled night
We'll find out just as sure as we live
Somethin's gotta give
Somethin's gotta give
Somethin's gotta give
Instrumental

Fight fight fight it with all of your might
Chances are that some heavenly star-spangled night
We'll find out just as sure as we live
Somethin's gotta give
Somethin's gotta give
Somethin's gotta give

Somethin's gotta give
Somethin's gotta give

SPOKEN: Aww, let's tear it up!
It's almost time...
I'm waiting...
Almost time...

Time keeps on slippin', into the future
Time keeps on slippin', into the future

I'm gonna fly like an eagle, to the sea
Fly like an eagle, let the spirit carry me
I'm gonna fly like an eagle, til I'm free
On through the revolution

Feed the babies who don't have enough to eat
Shoe the children with no shoes on their feet
House the people livin' in the street
Ooooh, there's a solution

I'm gonna fly like an eagle, to the sea
Fly like an eagle, let the spirit carry me
I'm gonna fly like an eagle, til I'm free
On through the revolution
There are times when I would like
To fly away from here
Far this place of hurt and woe
And just disappear
To that place prepared by my love
That is where I'll go
Waiting for that great day 'cause I love Him so

I love Him so

[Sax solo]

Time keeps on slippin'
Time keeps on slippin'
Wold keeps on fightin'
Brother keepin on dyin'
Time keeps on slippin'
People keep on trippin'
World keeps on fightin'
But I am delightin'
In the fact that I will fly away
I'll fly away
One day i'm gonna fly away
One day i'm gonna fly away...
Alright, right now
Everytime we've been here
We've asked you to do one thing for us
And that, that one thing is to help us out
And yell something
Alright
And the thing we want you to yell
Three words"let's go trippin'"
We want you to yell out on the count of three OK?
One, Two, Two-and-a-half, Three
LET'S GO TRIPPIN'!
Yeah, baby!
Instrumental
Thank you
Thank you very much

[Verse 1]
Come to the dinner gong
The table is laden high
Fat bellies and hungry little ones
Tuck your napkins in and take your share

[Chorus 1]
Some get the gravy
And some get the gristle
Some get the marrow bone
And some get nothing though there's plenty to spare

[Verse 2]
I took my share down by the sea
Paper plates and Javex bottles on the tide
Seagulls come down and they squawk at me
Down where the water-skiers glide

[Chorus 2]
Some turn to Jesus
And some turn to heroin
Some turn to rambling round
Looking for a clean sky and a drinking stream

[Chorus 3]
Some watch the paint peel off
Some watch their kids grow up
Some watch their stocks and bonds
Waiting for that big deal American Dream

[Verse 3]
I took my dream down by the sea
Yankee yachts and lobster pots and sunshine
And logs and sails and Shell Oil pails
Dogs and tugs and summertime
Back in the banquet line, angry young people crying

[Chorus 4]
Who let the greedy in?
Who left the needy out?
Who made this salty soup?
Tell him we're very hungry now for a sweeter fare

[Chorus 5]
In the cookie I read, "Some get the gravy
And some get the gristle
Some get the marrow bone
And some get nothing though there's plenty to spare"

[Verse 1]
Through the windless wells of wonder
By the throbbing light machine
In a tea leaf trance or under
Orders from the king and queen

[Chorus]
Songs to aging children come
Aging children, I am one

[Verse 2]
People hurry by so quickly
Don't they hear the melodies
In the chiming and the clicking
And the laughing harmonies

[Chorus]
Songs to aging children come
Aging children, I am one

[Verse 3]
Some come dark and strange like dying
Crows and ravens whistling
Lines of weeping, strings of crying
So much said in listening

[Chorus]
Songs to aging children come
Aging children, I am one

[Verse 4]
Does the moon play only silver
When it strums the galaxy
Dying roses will they will their
Perfumed rhapsodies to me

[Outro]
Songs to aging children came
This is one
If you love me, baby
Why don't you write me sometime
If you, if you love me, baby
Why don't you let me
Hear from you sometime
You don't do nothing
But keep me worried
You just keep me worried
All the time

You know I think about you, baby
I think about you
Every night about this time
Oh you know, you know
You know I think about you, baby
I think about you
Every night about this time
It seems like you would treat me
A little better, baby
It seems like you would be
A little nicer and kind

Let me love you one more time, baby
Let me love you one more time
Before you go away
Let me, let me love you
One more time, baby
One more time before you go away
If you let me love you one more time
I think we can talk it over
Before you go away

Here I am, baby
My heart's right here in my hand
Oh here I am, baby
My heart's right here in my hand
Oh I don't want you to leave me, baby
Don't want you to go
To no other man
You get your pleasures out of hurting me, honey
You get your kicks out of watching me cry
You play around an awful lot to hurt me, honey
Why do you laugh when there are tears in my eyes

I don't think it's funny, honey
My skies are not so sunny
Why don't you make up your mind
Let me put my arms around you
Make rainbows all around you
But I don't know if you are mine

If I was yours and you were mine, my little honey
We could be happy till the very day I die
But all you ever want to do is hurt me, honey
Why do you laugh when there are tears in my eyes

I don't think it's funny, honey
My skies are not so sunny
Why don't you make up your mind
Let me put my arms around you
Make rainbows all around you
But I don't know if you are mine
I don't think it's funny, honey
My skies are not so sunny
Why don't you make up your mind
Let me put my arms around you
Make rainbows all around you
But I don't know if you are mine

But I don't know if you are mine
But I don't know if you are mine
To lay me down, once more
To lay me down with my head in sparklin' clover
To lay me down, one last time, to lay me down

To be with you, once more, to be with you
With our bodies close together
Let the world go by, like the clouds a'streamin'
To lay me down, one last time, to lay me down

To lay me down, to lay me down, to lay me down, one last time
To lay me down
To lie with you, once more, to lie with you
With our dreams entwined together
To wake beside you, my love still sleepin'
To tell sweet lies, one last time and say good night
To lay me down, to lay me down, to lay me down, one last time
To lay me down, one last time, to lay me down
To lay me down, to lay me down, to lay me down, to lay me down
To lay me down
Oh what are you going to do
When there's a part of you
That needs to chase the wind
And the fire of burning yesterdays
Can only light the way
To lead you from the garden of the dark

If you listen to fools then now
It's like the chains are on
Today is never gone, tomorrow just never comes
Go on and jump, yeah, into the hurricane
You will forget the pain
It's only there to open up your mind

Looking at the world through your innocent eyes
You're seeing the promises now
They're only lies and broken dreams
Your silent screams

But you're living in a time machine
And you can choose just who you are
Someone that you've never seen
Somewhere that you've never been
You're living in a time machine
Oh what are you going to do
When every part of you
Just needs to catch the wind
And the fire of burning yesterdays
Can only light the way
To lead you from the garden of the dark

Looking at the world through your innocent eyes
You're seeing the promises now
They're only lies and broken dreams
I hear your silent screams

You're living in a time machine
And you can choose just where to go
Somewhere that you've never been
The somewhere you don't know

You're living in a time machine
And you can choose just who you are
Somewhere that you've never been
Someone you've never seen
You're living in a time machine
There is a place in me
That no one but You can see
And in that place I'm really insecure
I've been hurt before by that
But I'm really sure You understand
Every tear I've cried
I bet You've cried a million more
How can I get back to where my smile I had was real
I'm desperate for Your touch
And I miss Your voice so much

Lord show me Your face
I'm longing for Your presence in this place
I give You all the pieces
'Cause you made a promise
You put me back together
Better than I was before

In the coldness of the night
I'm surrounded by Your light
Even in the darkness
You tell me don't be afraid
I am not afraid
After all that I've been through
I'm still valuable to you
So I run to Your arms
Where I'm safe within Your praise
And just in case I forgot to tell You
Don't ever let me go
I'm desperate for Your touch
And I miss Your voice so much
Lord show me Your face
I'm longing for Your presence in this place
I give You all the pieces
'Cause you made a promise
You put me back together
Better than I was before

Lord, show me your will
Until you do I promise that I'll be still
So, come and take these pieces and
You made me a promise
You put me back together
Better than I was before

Before I met You
Before I knew You
My heart ached for something that I could not explain
And then, when I saw You
I finally knew what I thought love was before had changed
Lord show me Your face
I'm longing for Your presence in this place
I give You all the pieces
'Cause you made a promise
You put me back together
Better than I was before
I'm gonna call up some of my buddies
And a few of the ladies I know
I'm gonna rent a hall and get them all and
Put on a heck of a show

Make sure we got a kitchen
With a oven and a stove
We'll all get in there cookin'
Then we'll throw open all the doors

Playin' with my friends
Playin' with my friends
Playin' with my friends
We'll have a good time
Playin' with my friends

I'm gonna buy a 100 pounds of catfish
Cook it all up on the grill
Fix some beans and corn bread
Everybody's gonna get their fill
Then we'll grab all the guitars
Greasy hands and all
Someone'll count off a shuffle
And man we'll have a ball

Playin' with my friends
Playin' with my friends
Playin' with my friends
We'll have a good time
Playin' with my friends

Yes, we gonna buy some of that red, red wine
The best that money can buy
You gotta drink it all from a paper cup
That this here Saturday life is right

Everybody's gonna stand up
Play their favorite tune
You can pick any tune you want to
As long as it's the blues

Playin' with my friends
Playin' with my friends
Playin' with my friends
We'll have a good time
Playin' with my friends

[Intro]
Yeah, see, the dog—
I know you heard it before, but— hm, haha
This is that— This is that Bonnie and Clyde (Let's go)

[Pre-Chorus: Kashmere]
He got my back, I got him
I can't walk this dog without him
He won't be the same without me
Down for whatever and that's how it's gon' be, yeah
He got my back, I got him
I can't walk this dog without him
He won't be the same without me
Down for whatever and that's how it's gon' be, yeah

[Chorus: Kashmere]
Don't get discouraged if your dreams don't come true
I got your back and I'm gon' be there for you
When the stress is too much and you don't know what to do
I got your back and I'm gon' be there for you, oh

[Verse 1: DMX]
Shorty got my back like a jacket
Hold me down when I can't hack it
Bring in the paper, she stack it
Walking together with the ratchet, mami gon' snatch it
Drop the ball and she catch it, that's how we do
Bonnie and Clyde, nigga, this how we do
She down for the ride, nigga, this how we do
'Til a nigga die, this how we do

[Chorus: Kashmere]
Don't get discouraged if your dreams don't come true
I got your back and I'm gon' be there for you
When the stress is too much and you don't know what to do
I got your back and I'm gon' be there for you, oh (Yo)

[Verse 2: Kashmere & DMX]
I hold him down like nobody else
So when it's time to ride, I'm by his side, he don't count on nobody else
Run up in the spot with the hammers
Hoodies, sweats and bandanas, disable them cameras
Get what we came for (Come on, let's get gone)
'Cause when it come to that paper (We get it on)
I'm here for him 'cause I know he need that
And I'ma be by side 'til the day that I die, believe that (Secret Specialists)

[Refrain: Kashmere]
He got my back, I got him
I can't walk this dog without him
He won't be the same without me
Down for whatever and that's how it's gon' be
He got my back, I got him
I can't walk this dog without him
He won't be the same without me
Down for whatever and that's how it's gon' be, yeah

[Verse 3: DMX]
When it rains, it pours, my pains are yours
Pop with the mop and bleach so it stains the floors
We gon' clean up the mess we made
Roll out and live good for the rest of our days
She got me and I got her
Still get up in that pussy like, "Grr"
We don't even care, put that behind us
Cops looking for us, let the motherfuckers find us

[Chorus: Kashmere]
Don't get discouraged if your dreams don't come true
I got your back and I'm gon' be there for you
When the stress is too much and you don't know what to do
I got your back and I'm gon' be there for you, oh
Don't get discouraged if your dreams don't come true
I got your back and I'm gon' be there for you
When the stress is too much and you don't know what to do
I got your back and I'm gon' be there for you, oh
When I was a boy, all the books I read
I followed like a blind man
To heed the words my father said
Those golden summers faded into night, words become a dream
The echoes of my childhood and where the path is winding

May God bless you, keep you safe from harm
I stand by you always
Time and motion
Hands touch, lips find a way to heaven on high

Watch the children play, the child becomes a man
And all the tangled webs we weave
You swear it as you live and breathe
We stay together, death until you part
Winner takes the prize
The future's at your fingertips, right before your eyes

No more sorrows
(smoke and mirrors)
No more nights with no end
(I really learned a lot, smoke and mirrors)
I see my tomorrows
And nothing from nothing
And ashes to ashes they say
All the more that you reach out
The more that it runs away

(Smoke and Mirrors)

No more goodbyes
(That's all I ever got, smoke and mirrors)
No lies, you find your way there
(Show me what she's got, smoke and mirrors)
Heaven on high

May God bless you, keep you from all harm
I stand my you always

Time and motion
(Smoke and mirrors)
Hands touch, lips find a way to
(That's all I ever got, smoke and mirrors)
Heaven on high

No more sorrows
(I really learned a lot, smoke and mirrors)
No more nights with no end
(Show me what shes got, smoke and mirrors)
I rise or I fall
No more goodbyes
(She really makes me hot, smoke and mirrors)
No lies, you find a way there
Heaven on high

[Verse 1]
Don't interrupt the sorrow, darn right
In flames our prophet witches, be polite
A room full of glasses he says, "Your notches, liberation doll"
And he chains me with that serpent to that Ethiopian wall

[Verse 2]
Anima rising, Queen of Queens
Wash my guilt of Eden, wash and balance me
Anima rising, uprising in me tonight
She's a vengeful little goddess with an ancient crown to fight

[Verse 3]
Truth goes up in vapors, the steeples lean
Winds of change, patriarchs snug in your bible belt dreams
God goes up the chimney like childhood Santa Claus
The good slaves love the good book, a rebel loves a cause

[Verse 4]
I'm leaving on the 1:15, you're darn right
Since I was seventeen I've had no one over me
He says "Anima rising, so what?
Petrified wood process, tall timber down to rock"

[Verse 5]
Don't interrupt the sorrow, darn right
He says, "We walked on the moon, you be polite"
Don't let up the sorrow, death and birth and death and birth and death and birth
He says, "Bring that bottle kindly and I'll pad your purse
I've got a head full of quandary and a mighty mighty mighty thirst"

[Verse 6]
Seventeen glasses, Rhine wine
Milk of the Madonna, clandestine
He don't let up the sorrow, he lies and he cheats
It takes a heart like Mary's these days when your man gets weak

[Intro]
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six
Five, four, three, two, one
(Injection Fellas)

[Chorus]
Uh, ah (Shh)
Uh, ah (Don't worry about a thing, baby)
Uh, ah
Uh, ah (Just let me love you)

[Verse 1]
In a minute, we'll be finished
Was I all that you hoped and dreamed?
Was I strong enough (Strong enough)
To make you feel me?
Did I dig too deep in your mind?
You were thinking of ways to make me work
For something we both wanted (Now you're here, I need to express it like this)
All through the night, all I heard you say was

[Chorus]
Uh, ah
Uh, ah
Uh, ah
Uh, ah

[Verse 2]
Now that we're done, what are you thinking?
Should we talk about it maybe?
You look so beautiful lying there
With the moonlight shining on you
What has come over me?
Oh, you feel so good
Oh, you feel so good, oh (Let's do it)

[Chorus]
Uh, ah
Uh, ah
Uh, ah (Oh, come on, baby)
Uh, ah (Oh, I need you tonight, baby, baby, baby)
Uh, ah (Oh, oh, come a little closer to me, baby)
Uh, ah (Come closer to Shawn)
Uh, ah (Oh)
Uh, ah (Yeah)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Bridge]
Toss and turn back and forth
The love goes as the night flows
Ever so smoothly
I move you as you groove me
Taking our time as our bodies
Join to extract pure satisfaction
Holdin' and moldin' while I'm watching your reactions
To pure bliss as I rub and kiss
Every pleasure kept for moments like this

[Chorus]
Uh, ah
Uh, ah (All I wanna do)
Uh, ah
Uh, ah (Is make you feel like no other man has made you feel, yeah)
Uh, ah
Uh, ah
Uh, ah (I wanna let you know you have to look no further)
Uh, ah (For the affection you need, you have to look no further)
Uh, ah
Uh, ah (Oh, oh, oh)
Uh, ah (Because Im here, yeah)
Uh, ah (Because I'm here)
Uh, ah
Uh, ah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on, girl)
Uh, ah (Yeah, come on, girl, baby)
Uh, ah (Girl, oh yeah, babe)
Uh, ah (Come on, oh baby)
Uh, ah (It's good)
Uh, ah (Oh yeah)
Uh, ah

[Intro]
It doesn't matter if you love him, or capital H-I-M
Just put your paws up
'Cause you were born this way, baby

[Verse 1]
My mama told me when I was young
"We are all born superstars"
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
"There's nothing wrong with loving who you are"
She said, "'Cause He made you perfect, babe"
"So hold your head up and you'll go far
Listen to me when I say"

[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way (Born this way)

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way (Born this way)
Ooh, there ain't another way
Baby, I was born this way
Right track, baby
I was born this way

[Interlude]
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be (Don't be, don't be)

[Verse 2]
Give yourself prudence and love your friends
Subway kid, rejoice your truth
In the religion of the insecure
I must be myself, respect my youth
A different lover is not a sin
Believe capital H-I-M, hey, hey, hey
I love my life, I love this record and
Mi amore vuole fe yah (Same DNA)

[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way (Born this way)
Ooh, there ain't another way
Baby, I was born this way
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way

[Breakdown]
If we wanna make it country, baby, it's okay
'Cause I was born, I was born, I was born this way
From London, Paris, Japan, back to USA
Yeah, I was born on the road, I was born to be brave

[Bridge]
No matter gay, straight, or bi
Lesbian, transgender life
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born to survive
No matter black, white, or beige
Chola or orient made
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born to be brave!

[Chorus]
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, there ain't no other way
Baby, I was born this way
Baby, I was born this way (Born this way)
Ooh, there ain't another way
Baby, I was born this way
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way

[Outro]
I was born this way, hey
I was born this way, hey
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way, hey
I was born this way, hey
I was born this way, hey
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way, hey
Same DNA, but born this way
Same DNA, but born this way
Every day I wake, physically weaker than before
In my growing mind, the dreams I've left behind, the sign that there was more
Colourless and vague, the thoughts they slip away with the daylight
Can I get it back, what can I do to get them back inside?
Into the delay, the sounds don't carry on into the graves
All I've left to find, the parts I realise, all collective thoughts
Blackness it awaits, slumber hits the rain outside my window
With the brand new day, I've got some things I really have to find

[Verse 1]
It was a dark and a stormy night
Everyone was at the wing-ding
They weren't the wing-ding type
So they went up on the train bridge where the weather was howling

[Chorus]
And oh, oh, my my
When that train comes rolling by
No paper thin walls, no folks above
No one else can hear the crazy cries of love

[Verse 2]
They were laughing, they were dancing in the rain
They knew their love was a strong one
When they heard the far-off whistle of a train
They were hoping it was going to be a long one

[Chorus]
'Cause oh, oh, my my
When that train comes rolling by
No paper thin walls, no folks above
No one else can hear the crazy cries of love

[Bridge]
In the back booth of an all night café
Two dripping raincoats are hanging
Outside in the weather
The shade on the streetlight is clanging
And they smile ear to ear and eye to eye
Ice cream is melting on a piece of pie

[Refrain]
Oh, my my
No one else can hear the cries of love

[Verse 3]
Every kiss was sweet and strong
Every touch was totally tandem
As the train come a-rumbling along
They sang a lover's song of wild abandon

[Chorus]
And oh, oh, my my
When that train comes rolling by
No paper thin walls, no folks above
No one else can hear the crazy cries of love

[Outro]
No paper thin walls, no folks above
No one else can hear the crazy cries of love
You asked me to forget about you
Go out and find someone new
That won't be easy you see
After all the things you've done for me
Though I'm a man, I ain't too proud to say
With you I stand tall and strong
Without you girl, I'm nothing at all

Like a snowman in the sun, my life was wasting away
Your love gave me hope and strength
You're the reason I'm alive today
How, I wanna know
How can I forget ya, woman
After all you've done for me
You'll always be apart of me

Girl, you don't realize what your love means to me
It's more precious than the air I breathe
I wanna know, how
How can I forget ya, woman
After all you've done for me
Girl, you'll always be apart of me
How, I wanna know
How can I forget ya, woman
After all you've done for me
You'll always be apart of me

How, how, how, how can I forget ya, woman
You've been so good, good baby
How can I forget ya
It's impossible to do
How can I forget ya, woman
You've been so good, good, good to me
How can I forget ya
I want to know
Ha-ha-ha, how can I forget ya
Hey Miss Riddle, I'm stuck in the middle again
I don't know how but you've got me playing both ends of a game I should know all about
But you came and turned inside out
Hey Miss Riddle, I'm stuck in the middle again

It's a long way home, it's late and yet we pretend
It's a long way home, you called last night "just friends"
So cool, so clear(?), so nonchalant, so absolutely what I want
Hey Miss Riddle, I'm stuck in the middle again

I've heard a lot of talk about how you were sizing me up
A line or two you've dropped about but don't let me interrupt
Your game, Miss Riddle, I'm stuck in the middle again

I've found out why those birds go looking for spring
I've found out what those dizzy heights can bring
'cuz I've found your lips are awfully nice
One stop south of paradise
Whatcha say Miss Riddle, I say we do it again

Hey Miss Riddle, I'm stuck in the middle again
I don't know how but you've got me playing both ends of a game I should know all about but you came and turned inside out
Hey Miss Riddle, I'm stuck in the middle...again
Whatcha say Miss Riddle, I say we do it again
It's a long way home
Whatcha say we stop it
Whatcha say we drop it
Whatcha say Miss Riddle, I say we do it again...
Is this your voice I heard
Speakin' my name
I hang on every word
Each letter that I write
Every day, every night
But I just can't live and learn

Talking to myself and believin'
I could live without you
Livin' on the lies and believin' that
Love would stay
Listen to me please and I'm beggin' on
My knees before you

But you don't show the way
No you don't show the way

He may change your world and someday
He may break your heart
And you deserve no better
If you love him I will step aside
I offer this to you
So leave me as I love you still
And if he don't keep you warm
You know I will
You know I will
So this is who you are
And the rest of my life
I dedicate to you
And I know that love can't wait
There's a moon and a sun
And a dream that sees me through

A little bit of change and
A little bit of my desire
I was shakin' all over and
I didn't know what to say
I'm the man in the middle and
The middle man catches fire
But I don't know how to go away
No I don't know how to go away

He became your hero somehow
I became your clown
And you deserve no better but my love
Is here and all I found
I offer this to you
So leave me as I love you still
And if he don't take your heart
You know I will

It ain't wise
It ain't smart
You say there's no doubt about it
If you decide
You got somebody else
When I want you to myself
I can't stop
I can't look
I can't say no more about it
But my love will go on
Just as long as the river flows
He will be your king and someday
He may let you down
Follow to the letter that my love is
Real and what I found
I offer it to you
So leave me as I love you still
And if he don't keep you warm
You know I will

[Verse 1]
I pulled up behind a Cadillac
We were waiting for the light
I took a look at his license plate
It said 'Just Ice'

[Verse 2]
Is justice just ice?
Governed by greed and lust
Just the strong doing what they can
And the weak suffering what they must

[Chorus]
Oh, and the gas leaks
And the oil spills
And sex sells everything
Sex kills
Oh, sex kills

[Verse 3]
Doctors' pills give you brand new ills
And the bills bury you like an avalanche
And lawyers haven't been this popular
Since Robespierre slaughtered half of France

[Verse 4]
And Indian chiefs with their old beliefs
Know the balance is undone
Crazy ions, you can feel it out in traffic
Everyone hates everyone

[Chorus]
And the gas leaks
And the oil spills
And sex sells everything
Sex kills
Oh, sex kills

[Verse 5]
All these jack-offs at the office
The rapist in the pool
Oh, and the tragedies in the nurseries
Little kids packing guns to school

[Verse 6]
The ulcerated ozone
These tumors of the skin
This hostile sun beating down
On the massive mess we're in

[Chorus]
And the gas leaks
And the oil spills
And sex sells everything
Sex kills

[Outro]
Sex kills
Sex kills
Oh, sex kills
Sex kills
It's quarter to three, there's no one in the place but you and me
So set 'em up Joe, I've got a little story you ought to know
We're drinking my friend to the end of a grieve episode
Make it one for my baby and one more for the road

I've got the routine so drop another nickel in the machine
I'm feeling so bad, I wish you'd make the music dreamy and sad
Could tell a lot but you've got to be true to your code
So make it one for my baby, yes and one more for the road

You'd never know it but buddy I'm a kind of poet
And I got a lot of things to say
And when I'm gloomy you simply got to listen to me
Till it's all talked away well that's how it goes
And Joe I know you're getting anxious to close

So thanks for the cheer
I hope you didn't mind me bending your ear
This torch I found must be drowned or it soon will explode
So make it one for my baby and one more for the road
That long, long road
Let my inspiration flow in token rhyme, suggesting rhythm
That will not forsake you, till my tale is told and done
While the firelight's aglow, strange shadows from the flames will grow
Till things we've never seen will seem familiar

Shadows of a sailor, forming winds both foul and fair all swarm
Down in Carlisle, he loved a lady many years ago
Here beside him stands a man, a soldier from the looks of him
Who came through many fights, but lost at love

While the story teller speaks, a door within the fire creaks;
Suddenly flies open, and a girl is standing there
Eyes alight, with glowing hair, all that fancy paints as fair
She takes her fan and throws it, in the lion's den

Which of you to gain me, tell, will risk uncertain pains of hell?
I will not forgive you if you will not take the chance
The sailor gave at least a try, the soldier being much too wise
Strategy was his strength, and not disaster

The sailor, coming out again, the lady fairly leapt at him
That's how it stands today. You decide if he was wise
The story teller makes no choice. Soon you will not hear his voice
His job is to shed light, and not to master
Since the end is never told, we pay the teller off in gold
In hopes he will return, but he cannot be bought or sold

Terrapin Station

Inspiration, move me brightly. Light the song with sense and color;
Hold away despair, more than this I will not ask
Faced with mysteries dark and vast, statements just seem vain at last
Some rise, some fall, some climb, to get to Terrapin

Counting stars by candlelight, all are dim but one is bright;
The spiral light of Venus, rising first and shining best
On, from the northwest corner, of a brand new crescent moon
While crickets and cicadas sing, a rare and different tune
Terrapin Station

In the shadow of the moon, Terrapin Station
And I know we'll get there soon, Terrapin Station
I can't figure out, Terrapin, if it's the end or beginning, Terrapin
But the train's put it's brakes on, Terrapin
And the whistle is screaming, TERRAPIN

Terrapin Station - At the Siding

While you were gone, these faces filled with darkness
The obvious was hidden. With nothing to believe in
The compass always points to Terrapin
Sullen wings of fortune beat like rain
You're back in Terrapin for good or ill again, for good or ill again
What a day for a daydream
What a day for a daydreaming boy
And now I'm lost in a daydream
Dreaming 'bout my bundle of joy

And even if time ain't really on my side
It's one of those days for takin' a walk outside
I'm blowing the day to take a walk in the sun
And fall on my face on somebody's new mowed lawn

I've been having a sweet dream
Been dreaming since I woke up today
It's starring me and my sweet dream
'Cause she's the one makes me feel this way

And even if time is passing me by a lot
I couldn't care less about these blues you say I've got
Tomorrow I'll pay the dues for dropping so low
A pie in the face for being a sleepy beau deau

And you can be sure that if you're feeling right
A daydream'll last along into the night
Tomorrow at breakfast you may perk up your ears
Or you may be daydreaming for a thousand years
What a day for a daydream
Custom made for a daydreaming boy
And now I'm lost in a daydream
Dreaming 'bout my bundle of joy
Front and centre
I don't know how it happened then
I can't explain it
What was she thinking of when
Mother Nature
She put us both together, and
The way she touched me
And I ran that red light and so I
Said I love her
She tell me I don't matter
I try to kiss her
But every dream is shattered
No early warning
Except the morning after
Look in the mirror like a rabbit in the headlights

She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on coming back for more
Champagne and roses
Breakfast in bed
Wrapped in each other
And out of my head
She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on coming back for more
Oh no
Oh no
Yeah
Oh no

She ain't no Cleopatra
I ain't no Julius Caesar
I ain't no Casanova
She ain't no Mona Lisa
She charm a nation
She send you out to die
And we were flying when she ran that red light
I ain't no Valentino
She ain't no Greta Garbo
No Aphrodite
I'll never be Apollo
But when we come together
There's no one else can follow
There's no tomorrow when we run that red light

She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on knocking at the door
Drunk on desire
Erotic delights
Sooner or later, she'll kiss you goodnight
She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on coming back for more
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no

Midnight
Die in the arms of a lover
Hold tight
I close my eyes and she's gone
Dream time
She's mine
Always here
Small town
Daytime
Disappear

She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on coming back for more
Drunk on desire
Erotic delights
Sooner or later, she'll kiss you goodnight
But she keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on knocking at the door
She keeps on coming back for more
She keeps on coming back for more

[Verse]
What a wonderful world
I see trees of green, red roses too
I see them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world
I see skies of blue, clouds of white
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night
And I think to myself (Think to myself), what a wonderful world
The colours of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people passin'by
I see friends shakin'hands, sayin', "How do you do?"
They're really saying "I Love You"
I hear babies cryin', I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know
And I think to myself (Think to myself), what a wonderful world
What a wonderful world
The colours of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people passin' by
I see friends shakin'hands sayin', "How do you do?"
They're really saying, "I love you"
I hear babies crying I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know
And I think to myself (Think to myself), what a wonderful world
Such a wonderful world...
Oh sleeping beauty, it's time to wake up
And get ready for a brand new day
It's the new millennium and time to rise
And maybe think in a different way

Take a deep breath, have a look around
Are you happy with what you see?
If your body's fit and your mind is clear
No reason you ought not to be

If some joker's trying to sell you some new sport drink
Just tell him that you'll have to pass
You're paying three times as much for this bottle of water
As you're paying for a gallon of gas

'Cause everything counts even small amounts
When you're working towards a goal
It's not about simple thirsts or hungers
But satisfying your soul

Get on the natch and don't talk back
Get on the natch, get off your booty
Get on the natch, we'll allarootie
I can't tell you what to do, do, do
You eat a bucket of grease and a can full of sugar
You're adding to the critical mass
Pretty soon you're gonna need a new wardrobe
To cover your big new ass

I ain't saying slim is beautiful
Or you got to be some showdog
But go down to the gym or find a place to swim
And ask the doctor if you can't jog

If not your body, your memory
Think back to what it's like as a kid
When you're running and climbing and jumping around
Having fun with the things you did

It's not easy, it's hard at first
When you're breaking the old routine
Get off your behind, cut some TV time
Try reading that magazine

Get on the natch and don't talk back
Get back in here you little
Get on the natch, we'll allarootie
I can't tell you what to do, do, do

You better watch out, it's alright to cry
But we don't like nobody whines
And being cool ain't acting son
It's like read between the lines
Try a little dignity, have self respect
And you'll reap just what you sow
If you're not sure about something don't worry about it
Just tell 'em, "I don't know"

Get on the natch, don't talk back
Get on the natch and get your feet off the couch
Get on the natch, we'll allarootie
I can't tell you what to do, do, do

Get on the natch
Get back in there you little
Get on the natch and don't talk back
Get on the natch, we'll allarootie
I can't tell you what to do, do, do

Get on the natch, 

[Incomprehensible]
Get on the natch
Slam that back door one more time, we'll allarootie
Get on the natch, get off your booty

Get on the natch, good God Bernice
Get on the natch
Slam that back door one more time, we'll allarootie
I can't tell you what to do, do, do
Get on the natch, don't talk back
This is the life you saved laid out before you
Everything that I think I have been and what I am now
Nothing can change the way I feel about you
Better we go on our separate ways
Nothing is left but the endless days
Nothing to cry but your name

Don't you look back, don't say a word
I will be lonely for you, I will be standing for you
Don't you despair
I will be there for you
Farewell to you, goodbye for me
I will be waiting for you, I will be lonely for you
Don't you despair
I will be there for you
Ohh, ohh
I will be there
Ohh, ohh
I will be there

Maybe this time next year we'll be together
You can wipe away all of the tears, bring truth to the lies
There was a silent dream, we made a promise
We'd be there for each other forever
Borne like a ship on the ocean's roar
Beating a path to your open door
Nothing will keep me away

Don't you look back, don't say a word
I will be lonely for you, I will be standing for you
Don't you despair
I will be there for you
Each night I pray, to God above
You will be waiting for me, you will be lonely for me
Don't you despair
I will be there for you
Ohh, ohh
I will be there
Ohh, ohh
I will be there
Ohh, ohh
I will be there
Ohh, ohh
I will be there
Ohh, ohh
I will be
I remember you
You're the one that made my dreams come true
Just a few kisses ago
I remember you
You're the one who said I love you too
Yes I do
Didn't you know
I remember too, a distant bell
And stars that fell, like the rain
Out of the blue

When my life is through
And the angels ask me to recall
The thril of them all
Then I will tell them I remember
Tell them I remember
Tell them I remember you

I remember too, a distant bell
And stars that fell, like the rain
Out of the blue
When my life is through
And the angels ask me to recall
The thrill of them all
Then I will tell them I remember
Tell them I remember
Tell them I remember you

[Verse 1]
I fell in love with the girl in the picture
That I used to keep
Carried her 'round in the back of my pocket
She was always with me
I imagined that I was a man of importance
And she had a fancy for me

[Chorus]
And I use to dream she would call
Crying her eyes out
She had an obsession with me
I was the love of her life
And she was all mine
The girl in the Life magazine

[Verse 2]
The first time we met in an aisle
At the market
She was staring at me
I knew even then we would share
Something special
And it was like chemistry
I fell in love from the moment I saw her
So I took her straight home with me

[Chorus]
And that's where I'd dream
She would step right out of the picture
And spend the whole evening with me
And oh how she hated to go
Back to her picture
The girl in the Life magazine

[Bridge]
All of my friends used to laugh
Said I was certifiably mad
'Till the day she came
And she blew them away
And asked me if I'd be her man

[Chorus]
It seems that she went and fell
In love with my letters
She says she's been looking for me
And so the story ends well
We end up together
The girl in the Life magazine
Me and the girl in the Life magazine

[Verse 1]
I am a woman of heart and mind
With time on her hands, no child to raise
You come to me like a little boy
And I give you my scorn and my praise

[Verse 2]
You think I'm like your mother
Or another lover or your sister
Or the queen of your dreams
Or just another silly girl when love makes a fool of me

[Verse 3]
After the rush when you come back down
You're always disappointed, nothing seems to keep you high
Drive your bargains. push your papers, win your medals, fuck your strangers
Don't it leave you on the empty side?

[Verse 4]
I'm looking for affection and respect, a little passion
And you want stimulation, nothing more, that's what I think
But you know I'll try to be there for you
When your spirits start to sink

[Verse 5]
All this talk about holiness now
It must be the start of the latest style
Is it all books and words or do you really feel it?
Do you really laugh, do you really care, do you really smile when you smile?

[Verse 6]
You criticize and you flatter
You imitate the best and the rest you memorize
You know the times you impress me most
Are the times when you don't try
When you don't even try
The Beatles
Miscellaneous
Shake, Rattle, And Roll
Rattle and roll
I said shake, rattle, and roll
Well you never do nothing
To save your doggone soul
Well get out of that kitchen
And shake those pots and pans
I said get out of that kitchen
And shake those pots and pans
I said to my soul:
You're the devil in the frying pan
Well I said shake, rattle, and roll
I said shake, rattle, and roll
I said shake, rattle, and roll
I said shake, rattle, and roll
Well you never do nothing
To save your doggone soul

[Verse 1]
When I was a little baby
My mama would rock me in the cradle
In them there, ol' cotton fields at home
When I was a little baby
My mama would rock me in the cradle
In them there, ol' cotton fields at home

[Bridge]
Oh, when them cotton balls get rotten
You can't pick very much cotton
In them there, ol' cotton fields at home
It was down in Louisiana
Just a mile from Texarkana
In them there ol' cotton fields at home

[Verse 2]
Now it may sound very funny
But you didn't make very much money
In them there, ol' cotton fields at home
Yes, it might sound very funny
But you didn't make very much money
In them there, ol' cotton fields at home

[Bridge]
Oh, when them cotton balls get rotten
You can't pick very much cotton
In them there, ol' cotton fields at home
It was down in Louisiana
Just a mile from Texarkana
In them there ol' cotton fields at home

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I was over in Arkansas
When the sheriff asked me
"What did you come here for?"
In them there, ol' cotton fields at home
Yes, I was over in Arkansas
When the sheriff asked me
"What did you come here for?"
In them there, ol' cotton fields at home

[Bridge]
Oh, when them cotton balls get rotten
You can't pick very much cotton
In them there, ol' cotton fields at home
It was down in Louisiana
Just a mile from Texarkana
In them there, ol' cotton fields at home

[Verse 4]
When I was a little baby
My mama would rock me in the cradle
In them there, ol' cotton fields at home
When I was a little baby
My mama would rock me in the cradle
In them there, ol' cotton fields at home

[Outro]
Oh, when them cotton balls get rotten
You can't pick very much cotton
In them there, ol' cotton fields at home
It was down in Louisiana
Just a mile from Texarkana
In them there, ol' cotton fields at home
In them there, ol' cotton fields at home
Yeah
There was a time when I loved you
That was a time baby, you made blue
There's a time for everything, baby
Now it's time to say we're through
Remember the time baby, you made me cry
And the time baby, you broke my heart
But there's a time for everything, baby
Now it's time for us to part
Remember the time baby, you made me cry
And the time baby, you broke my heart
But there's a time for everything, baby
Now it's time for us to part
They say that time, time bring 'bout a change
And I know baby, I know that's no lie
In time I will forget you, baby
So it's time to say goodbye

[Verse 1]
I was stood by the light as I looked through your window
With the greatest intention not meaning to see
I was there in the dark and I saw you together
You were up in his arms, I was down on my knees
Get the cards on the table
No need to pretend
You've got to be cruel to be kind
He can sell you his love and you know, you will pay but

[Chorus]
He's a liar
He's a liar, and I should know!
Liar
He's a liar, and I should know, ahh!

[Verse 2]
Well, they told me I fell but I just don't remember
I was standing face down, they were there at my feet
There was smoke in the air and the sweet smell of leather
I was through the window and down in the street
Well, I'm cold and I'm hungry but I'm still alive
And it's not how I want it to be
There's a hand on my shoulder
He said I'll survive but

[Chorus]
He's a liar
He's a liar, and I should know!
He's a liar
He's a liar, and I should know, ahh!

[Release]
Was it not for the man that was blocking the drive
Was it not for the red limousine
I'd be millions of miles from the scene of the crime
And somehow in this madness believe she was mine but

[Chorus]
I'm a liar
He's a liar, and I should know!
Liar
He's a liar, and I should know!

[Outro]
He's a liar
He's a liar, and I should know!
He's a liar
He's a liar, and I should know!
He's a liar
He's a liar, and I should know!
He's a liar
He's a liar, and I should know!
He's a liar...
Purple haze all in my brain
Lately things don't seem the same
Actin' funny, but I don't know why
'Scuse me while I kiss the sky

Purple haze all around
Don't know if I'm comin' up or down
Am I happy or in misery?
Whatever it is, that girl put a spell on me

Help me
Help me
Oh, no, no

Hammerin'
Talkin' 'bout heart 'n' s-soul
I'm talkin' about hard stuff
If everybody's still around, fluff and ease, if
So far out my mind
Something's happening, something's happening
Ooo, ahhh
Ooo, ahhh
Ooo, ahhh
Ooo, ahhh, yeah!

Purple haze all in my eyes, uhh
Don't know if it's day or night
You got me blowin', blowin' my mind
Is it tomorrow or just the end of time?

Ooh
Help me
Ahh, yea-yeah, purple haze, yeah
Oh, no, oh
Oh, help me
Tell me, baby, tell me
I can't go on like this
You're makin' me blow my mind, mama
N-no, nooo
No, it's painful, baby
If your whole life somehow
Wasn't much 'til now
And you've almost lost
Your will to live
No matter what you've been through
Long as there's breath in you
There is always one more time

And if your dreams go bad
Every one that you've had
That don't mean that some dreams
Can't come true
'Cause it's funny about dreams
As strange as it seems
There is always one more time

Oh turnin' corners
Is only a state of mind
Keeping your eyes closed
Is worse than being blind
If there's a heart out there
Looking for someone to share
I don't care if it's been
Turned down time and time again
And if we meet one day
Please don't walk away
'Cause there is always one more time
There is always one more time
I saw you sleeping on the couch tonight
You know it serves you right
Makes you luckier than i
All the colors in the room have changed
Appear to disagree
But brother ive discovered you
We're pushin on
We're passin through
And it won't be long
Till i walk with you
But tonight im down
But im inside out
Staring at the pictures in the album you forgot about
But isn't it a shame
The times have changed
But isnt it strange
Lifelines stay the same
The same

We're never where we wanna be
That's ok with me
It's just the way it is it seems
It feels like make believe
But you're my history
But brother i've rediscovered you and
We're pushing on
We're passing through
And it won't be long
Till i walk with you
But tonight im down
Im inside out
Staring at the pictures in the album you forgot about
But isnt it a shame
The times have changed
But isnt it strange
Lifelines stay the same
Round and round
Can't believe my heart has waited this long
All along
We've been children in a cold world where
Wonder was lost every day
And if love was a compass
Oh i have lost my way
Welcome to my morning
Welcome to my day
Yes, I'm the one responsible
I made it just this way
To make myself some pictures
And see what they might bring
I think I made it perfectly
I wouldn't change a thing

(La la la, la-la-la-la-la-la)
(La la la, la-la-la-la-la-la)

Welcome to my happiness
You know it makes me smile
And it pleases me to have you here
For just a little while
While we open up the spaces
Try to break some chains
And if the truth is told
They will never come again
(La la la, la-la-la-la-la-la)
(La la la, la-la-la-la-la-la)
(La la la, la-la-la-la-la-la)
(La la la, la-la-la-la-la-la)

Welcome to my evening
The closing of the day
You know, I could try a million times
Never find a better way
To tell you that I love you
And all the songs I play
Are to thank you for allowing me
In the lovely day you made

Welcome to my morning
Welcome to my day
Yes, I'm the one responsible
I made it just this way
To make myself some pictures
And see what they might bring
I think I made it perfectly
I wouldn't change a thing

(La la la, la-la-la-la-la-la...)
Everybody's got to walk this lonesome valley
We've got to walk it by ourselves
There's nobody here can walk it for us

Got 'em hittin’ notes that mariah couldn’t carry
All you player haters going down like mary
Cop the rolls royce a player with a choice
Ladies stay moist from the sound of my voice
The lady killers pass the keys to our villas
Rockland track masters top billers

[Verse 1]
There is no glory, there is no time
Don't ask direction to see you die
There's no religion, no paradise
No superstition, nowhere to run

[Refrain]
We don't fade away
We don't fade away

[Verse 2]
There won't be no future, there won't be no pain
There won't be no tainted, no one to blame
No children growing, no getting old
No one is dying, the story's told

[Refrain]
We don't fade away
We don't fade away
We don't fade away
We don't fade away

[Bridge]
Can't find tomorrow, you can't go to rain
You don't feel no love, you'll probably be insane

[Chorus]
I can't awake to scary dreams
I'm lost inside your guarantee
I've just been waking scary dreams
I can't be escaping scary dreams

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
I can't awake to scary dreams
I'm lost inside your guarantee
I've just been waking scary dreams
I can't be escaping scary dreams

[Instrumental Outro]
Come on down hard on me baby
Come on down hard as you can
Come on down hard on me baby
Lord, come on down hard as you can
Come on down hard on me baby
Show me that I'm your lover man

Come on down hard juicy
Turn me into jelly bread
Bring that love down hard on me baby
Rock me, rock me right through the bed
Come on down hard on me baby
Please show me I'm your lover man

I want to love you so much 'til I hope we can make it
I want to love you so much 'til I hope I don't break it
I want to love you so much 'til I can't stand it
I want to love you so strong 'til you've got to say you've had it
Yeah
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Oh, I don't know, I don't know, oh, where to begin
We are North Americans
And for those of you who still think we're from England
We're not, no

We build our planes and our trains till we think we might die
Far from North America
Where the buildings are old and you might have lots of mimes
Uh-huh, oh, oh

I hate the feelin' when you're looking at me that way
'Cause we're North Americans
But if we act all shy, it'll make it okay
Makes it go away

Oh, I don't know, I don't know, oh, where to begin
When we're North American
But in the end we make the same mistakes all over again
Come on, North Americans
Oh, we are North American scum
Oa, we're from North America

And all the kids, all the kids, that want to make a scene
Here in North America
When our young kids get to read it in your magazines
We don't have those

So where's the love, where's the love, where's the love, where's the love
Where's the love tonight?
But there's no love man, there's no love and the kids are uptight
Uh, uh

So throw a party till the cops come in and bust it up
Let's go, North Americans
Oh, you were planning it I didn't mean to interrupt
Sorry

I did it once and my parents got pretty upset
Freaked out in North America
But then I said the more I do it, the better it gets
Let's rock, North America

Oh, we are North American scum
Oh, we're from North America
Oh, we are North American scum
Oh, we are North American
New York's the greatest if you get someone to pay the rent
Wahoo, North America
And it's the furthest you can live from the government
Uh-huh, huh

Some fat American Christians might disagree
Here in North America
But New York's the only place we keep them off the street
Boo, boo

Now we can't have parties like in Spain where they go all night
Shut down in North America
Or like Berlin where they go another night, alright
Uh-huh, uh-huh

You see I love this place that I have grown to know
Alright, North America
And yeah, I know you wouldn't touch us with a ten-foot pole
'Cause we're North Americans

Oh, we are North American scum
Oh, we're are North Americans
Oh, we are North American scum
Oh, we love North America

Take me back to the states, man
North American scum
Where we can be in any one of million new bands
North American
Where the DJ gigs aren't as fun
Here in North American scum
But don't blame the Canadians
Look out North America

[Skit: Student & Jerome Weinberg]
"Boo! Fuck this dude! You're a clown"
"Good afternoon, Class of 2010. My name is Jerome Weinberg (ha ha). I'm running for Class President this year, because I believe I can bring positive things to the student body (Wow). My opponent, as you might have already heard, is Mac Miller (Cheah). Now... I know, he's the rapper, he gets all the ladies (Damn right) and he's that popular guy, but do you really want somebody running your school that smokes that much marijuana? Is that safe for your environment here at school? I've been in the bathroom and seen him lighting those Dutch Masters in the stall and that is not cool. So vote for me and not for weed. Thank you. Again, Jerome Weinberg."
All over town
That you've been seen, a-runnin' 'round
I know that I should leave but then
I just can't go, you win again

This heart of mine could never see
What everybody knew but me
Just trustin' you was my great sin
What can I do, you win again

I'm sorry for your victim now
Ah, soon his head like mine will bow
Yes, he give his heart but all in vain
As some they say, you win again

You have no heart, you have no shame
You take too long and give the blame
I guess I should not complain
I love you still, you win again

[Intro: Dr. Dre]
Hah, yeah
Hell yeah
Hah, know what I'm saying?
Yeah

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Mista Busta, where the you at?
Can't scrap a lick, so I know you got your gat
You stay on hard from From gankin' your road dogs
The hoods you threw up with, Homies you grew up with
Don't even respect your ass
That's why it's time for the doctor to check your ass, fool
Used to be my homie, used to be my ace
Now I wanna slap the taste out ya mouth
Make ya bow down to the Row
Gankin' me, now I'm Gankin' you, lil' ho
Oh, don't think I forgot, let you slide
Let me ride, just another homicide
Yeah, it's me so I'ma talk on
Stomping on the easiest streets that you can walk on
So strap on your Compton hat, your locs
And watch your back 'cause you might get smoked, loc
And pass the bud and stay low-key
B.G., 'cause you lost all your homie's love
Now call it what you want to
You trip with me, now it's a must that I trip with you

[Interlude: Dr. Dre]
You better raise up
You know what I'm sayin'
We now have your record company surrounded
Put down the candy and let the little boy go
Yeah
We want Eazy! We want Eazy! We want Eazy!

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Bow wow wow yippy yo yippy yay
Doggy Dogg's definitely in the House
Bow wow wow yippy yo yippy yay
Death Row's definitely in the House
Bow wow wow yippy yo yippy yay
The sounds of a dog brings me to another day
Play with my bone, would ya Timmy?
It seems like you're good for making jokes about your jimmy
Well, here's a jimmy joke about your mama that you might not like
I heard she was a 'Frisco dyke
But on the rizzeals, I'm talking about you and me
Toe to toe, Tim M-U-T
Your bark was loud but your bite wasn't vicious
And them rhymes you were kickin' were quite bootylicious
You get with Doggy Dogg? "Oh, is he crazy?"
With your mama and your daddy hollering "Baby!"
So won't they let you know
That if you step with Dre, fool, you're step wit Death Row
And I ain't even swangin' them thangs
I'm hollerin' 187 with my gat in your mouth, fool (Fool...)

[Interlude: RBX]
Yeah
Long Beach and Compton together on this track
And just when you thought we were slippin'
BOO-YEAH!
Right back at ya
Now
You wanna step up and get your cranium cracked
Step on up
And remember the name
Mighty
Mighty
D-R
And we puttin' in work
Yeah

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg]
Now understand this, my homie Dre can't be touched
Luke's bending over so Luke's getting stuffed, buster
Must've thought I was sleazy
Or thought I was a mark 'cause I used to hang with Eazy
Animosity made you speak what you spoke (Yeah)
Ayo, Dre (What up?) Break him off somethin', loc
If it ain't another ho that I gots to get with
Gap teeth in your mouth so my gat's gots to fit
With my sack on your tonsils
While you're on stage rappin' at your wack-ass concert
And I'ma snatch your ass from the backside
And show you how Death Row pull off that who-ride
Now you might not understand me
'Cause I'ma rob you in Compton and blast you in Miami
Then we gonna creep to South Central
On a street knowledge mission as I steps in the temple
Spot him, got him, as I pulls out my strap
Got my chrome to the side of his White Sox hat
You tryna check my homie, you best check yourself
'Cause when you diss Dre you diss yourself  (Hell yeah)

[Outro: Dr. Dre]
So all you mark-ass busters need to raise up
Really doe
Death Row is runnin' the nine-trey
And you know we can't be faded (faded...)
I've been so unlucky, I'm no good at playing games
I remember their faces, forget their names
Thought I'd found the right one, but she hasn't found me
So I bundle up my emotions and start looking for the right one
But will the right one ever come along?
Oh, I'm looking for the right one, when will the right one come along?

They say there's no use running after something you'll never get
But my heart says, "Don't say no."
Somewhere in this lonesome city is the woman for me

But would I wait another lifetime just to keep on looking for the right one?
But will the right one ever come along?
Oh, I'm looking for the right one, when will the right one come along?

They say love always comes and goes, well, that I already know. Yes, I really know
Looking for the right one but will the right one ever come along?
Looking for the right one but will the right one ever come along?

[Reversed Lyrics]
You should brush your teeth and you should wash your hands
You should brush your teeth and you should wash your hands
You should brush your teeth and you should wash your hands
You should brush your teeth and you should wash your hands
Sometimes I think girl
I love you too much now
All I do is sit home
And think about us now

I used to have lots of women
But where did they go now
Somebody tell me
'Cause I don't know

I must be losing my touch
(You're losing your touch)
(You're losing your touch)
(You're losing your touch)

Why do I let you
Mess with my mind baby
Why do I let you
Take up all my time baby

I can't get weak
I gotta be strong
I should be letting you go
But I keep holding on
I must be losing my touch
All right
(You're losing your touch)
Hey hey
(You're losing your touch)
This couldn't be me
(You're losing your touch)
I'm too cool for that
(You're losing your touch)

This couldn't be me
My game is too strong for that
I used to have all girls from blocks around
I used to have all this action in this town

Ah but look at me now
(You're losing your touch)
I must be losing my touch
(You're losing your touch)
Or either I love you too much baby
(You're losing your touch)
Losing my touch

If A Girl Answers (Don't Hang Up)
Brenda, how are we gonna get 2 the party?
Call up Jimmy, he's got a car
And what if a girl answers?
Hang up
Hang up nothin', Jimmy says I was his girl
Honey, don't U know everyone's Jimmy's girl?
Brenda, I know better than anybody
Well, if a girl answers, don't hang up, just talk about her
Yes
Hello, this is Vanity
Is Jimmy home?
Yes, but he's taking a shower
Oh, I see
Did he just take out the trash?
No, that's somethin' he use 2 do
Now he's taking out me
Oh, I see
Well, tell 'em he left his pants over here last night
That's OK, U keep 'em
He won't be needin' 'em 2 night
Oh, what's the matter
Is he going swimming?
Why no, we was gonna go
But he said he did that last night
Well sugar, I know about a great party
Why don't U bring us your car?
So sorry baby, but I never go 2 singles' bars
Singles? Is that what U think?
Tramp, I'm datin' your dad
Oh, he died about 7 years back
Now ain't that just 2 bad?
Well, that's how we like 'em - tall, stiff and ready
That's positively more than I can say 4 dead Jimmy
That's because he was swallowin' vitamin E
Now he's swallowin' me
Oh, U mean U were swallowin' him
Why don't U just tie a mattress 2 your back?
I'm gonna need it cuz if I ever see your face
I'm gonna fall and have a heart attack
All that's gonna fall is the wig off your head
Now what U think about that?
I think I'd rather wear a wig
Than run a motel 4 roaches, ants and lice
Dogs and cats in my hat
Hey, that's goin' 2 far
Here, give me the phone
Hey tramp, take a bath in puke
What's more, U can kiss where the sun don't shine
If that don't work, we can duke
U see, the only kinda man that would play with U
Is one that plays with himself
None of my friends could stand the sight of U
Much less the smell
And if I weren't a lady, I'd take my money
And buy U a brand new face
Then I'd take my underwear and stick it in your mouth
And U'd love it cuz U got no taste
And if that don't work, call back your dead daddy
And show him what U look like now
Honey, I'd bet he never come back
Cuz U one ugly cow (Ooh-wee)
Girl, U tell your boyfriend Jimmy he can go and get hit by a car
Cuz as far as I see it, he can't afford 2 bite the beat of this star
There's 2 things we can't stand
One's a jive talk man
The other's a jive talk man with no money
Can U dig it?

Yes, you thought
You had a good thing, baby
You could do what you wanted to do
Yes, but you'd better
Find you another thing, baby
Because this thing
Is cutting out on you
I'm tired of you putting me down
I think I'll do like a mole
And move underground

I tried to do
Everything for you, baby
Tried to give you everything
Even the stars above
Oh but you wanted someone
To play with, baby
And I needed me someone to love
I say I'm tired of you
Putting me down
I think I'll do like a mole
And move underground
Yes, I can't be a winner, baby
Because I was born to lose
I go to bed every night
With troubles, baby
Because I wake up
Thinking about you
I'm tired of you
Putting me down, baby
I think I'm gonna do like a mole
And move underground

Oh I paid the cost, baby
I even sing the blues
I've done everything to please you
And I'm tired of paying my dues
And I'm tired of you
Putting me down
That's why I'm gonna do like a mole
And move underground

[Verse 1]
I'm full of regret
For all things that I have done and said
And I don't know
If it'll ever be ok to show my face around here
Sometimes I wonder if I disappear

[Pre-Chorus]
Would you ever turn your head and look?
See if I'm gone
'Cause I fear

[Chorus]
There is nothing left to say to you
That you wanna hear
That you wanna know
I think I should go
I don't know how I got so tangled up

[Verse 2]
You're just innocent
A helpless victim of a spider's web
And I'm an insect
Goin' after anything that I can get

[Pre-Chorus]
So you better turn your head and run
And don't look back
'Cause I fear

[Chorus]
There is nothing left to say to you
That you wanna hear
That you wanna know
I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful
Oh
And I've done you so wrong
Treated you bad
Strung you along
Oh, shame on myself
I don't know how I got so tangled up

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
There is nothing left to say to you
That you wanna hear
That you wanna know
I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful
Oh
And I've done you so wrong
Treated you bad
Strung you along
Oh, shame on myself
I don't know how I got so tangled up

[Intro: DMX]
Yeah-yeah
Wild moves a hustler's gots to make
To get that cake
And if you fake, or you a snake
Then get bagged by jake
And that's how that's goin' down
Let me holla at you, yo

[Verse 1: DMX]
It's two o'clock and I'm just about to hit the streets
Until I knock off this rock, I don't get to eat
Sometimes it's like that's the only reason why I hustle
Step on toes, strong-arm and show a little muscle
It ain't no real dough, that's why a nigga feel so frustrated
I hate it, seein' crab niggas that made it
And I'm robbin' niggas just as broke as myself
Livin foul and ain't lookin out for my health, where's the wealth?
It ain't in New York, cause niggas talk about going out of state
Money got an eighth, comin back, coppin' a lot of weight
Where's my plate nigga? I'm hungry too
So I'ma do like hungry do, (what!) and get a hungry crew
Niggas that ain't never had, and doing bad
Will be glad to get up off they stoop, lookin sad
Grab your bags, it's about to go down
We going to this hicktown, let's get the low-down, on how they get down
I gots to make a move and make it soon (uh-huh!)
I gots to take the block and make it boom (c'mon!)
I gots to make a move and make it soon (what?)
I gots to take the block and make it boom (c'mon?)

I gots to make a move and make it soon
Gots to take the block and make it boom
We comin through so make some room
Found something that could be something if I pump it up
This kid Black is the only thing that could fuck it up
This purple top, thirty-five smalls is ringin' bells
But I'ma crush him with the black 40 double-L's
I send two niggas back up top, and come back
We chop up rock, by midnight, we open up shop
It's four in the morning, i'm on the block creepin
Killin the cash, while yo' ass is sleeping
Look here, I'm what they call a true hustler
Cause nigga if I ain't know you since I was like six
Then I don't trust ya
And we'll bust ya over somethin petty like two dollars
Put something hot up in that ass and watch you holla (Ahhhhh!)
You think I'm here for the hoe flow? I want the dough flow
And fuck the po'-po', a nigga keep a fo'-fo'

I gots to make a move and make it soon (uh-huh!)
I gots to take the block and make it boom (c'mon!)
I gots to make a move and make it soon (what?)
I gots to take the block and make it boom (c'mon?)
I spend my money on niggas cause niggas get me rich
And a bitch ain't doin shit but sucking my dick
Niggas is family now, and we stand strong
Thirty niggas over six blocks, making the cash long
Shit is good, because niggas gettin' what they been wantin'
And we see the same shit, up in New York niggas frontin'
Stick up kids hunting, but I ain't got no love for 'em
I keep the burner and the duster with the gloves for 'em
Them motherfuckin knockers come at us and chop us
And I know they, really tryin to stop us, they wanna drop us
So we pump, from the alley
And the last house we use as a cash house
Is holding up strong as a stash house
I got runners that run for twelve hour shifts
And when them niggas keep they count correct, I don't riff
Cause I ain't tryin to hear that "nigga took your pack" shit
I ain't tryin to hear jack shit, you fucking black bitch
I ain't a greedy nigga, all I want is a five year run
And if I don't make it, then fuck it, let me die near a gun
Got bitches to transport without an escort
I'm makin moves from D.C. up to Westport
Local police ain't a problem cause they don't even stress us
It be them ATF niggas that have you under pressure
So you know, I ain't gon' never put my Glock down (why nigga?)
Cause I'm a hustler motherfucker, and I'm holding my block down
I gots to make a move and make it soon (uh-huh!)
I gots to take the block and make it boom (c'mon!)
I gots to make a move and make it soon (uh-huh)
I gots to take the block and make it boom (c'mon?)

Old Man Bill in the motherfuckin' house!
(Speaks)
I sometimes wonder why people make promises they never intend to keep
Not in big things, like love or elections, but in the things that count -
The newspaper boy who says he will save an extra paper, and doesn't
The laundry that tells you your suit will be ready on Thursday and it isn't
Love, well yes, but like everything else, we go from day to day
We move from promise to promise
I've had a good many promises now, so I can wait for the harvest
And some of them, they come about

[Verse 1]
Ain't nothin' in the world that I like better
Than bacon an' lettuce n' homegrown tomatoes
Up in the mornin', an' out in the garden
Get you a ripe one, don't get a hard 'un
Plant 'em in the spring, you eat 'em in the summer
All winter without 'em's a culinary bummer
I forgot all about the sweatin' and the diggin'
Every time I go out and pick me a big'un

[Chorus]
Homegrown tomatoes, homegrown tomatoes
What'd life be without homegrown tomatoes?
Only two things that money can't buy
And that's true love and homegrown tomatoes

[Verse 2]
Well, you can go out a'eat, that's for sure
But there's nothin' that a homegrown tomato won't cure
Put 'em in a salad, put 'em in a stew
You can make your own, very own tomato juice
You can eat 'em with eggs, can eat 'em with gravy
You can eat 'em with beans, pinto or navy
Put 'em on the side, put 'em in the middle
Homegrown tomato on a hot cake griddle

[Chorus]
Homegrown tomatoes, homegrown tomatoes
What'd life be without homegrown tomatoes?
Only two things that money can't buy
And that's true love and homegrown tomatoes

[Verse 3]
If I's to change this life I lead
You could call me Johnny Tomatoseed
'Cause I know what this country needs
Homegrown tomatoes'n every yard you see
When I die, don't bury me
In a box in a cold, dark cemetery
Out in the garden would be much better
'Cause I could be a-pushin' up a-homegrown tomatoes

[Chorus]
Homegrown tomatoes, homegrown tomatoes
What'd life be without homegrown tomatoes?
There's only two things that money can't buy
And that's true love and homegrown tomatoes

Homegrown tomatoes, homegrown tomatoes
What'd life be without homegrown tomatoes?
There's only two things that money can't buy
And that's true love and homegrown tomatoes
Why'd you come here
All alone
You should go now
(Go right back home)
Oh my dear it's begun
But there are some things
(Better left undone)
Like me here with you
Baby I make mistakes too
Monday's romance
Is Tuesday's sad affair

For a moment
Through the crowd
I could hear your heart
(Talking right out loud)
Whispering to me like a child
So impatient
(Latin lover style)
Your heart it's a start
Way beyond a fast affair
It's the moon
And garland in your hair
(Whatcha gonna tell your man)
Oh whatcha gonna tell your man
(How you gonna make him understand)
Oh understand
What'd you have to go and do it for
Make me want you like I do

(Whatcha gonna tell your man)
Hey whatcha gonna tell your man
(How you gonna make him understand)
Understand baby
What'd you have to go and do it for
Make me want you like I do

Are you crazy
Out of your mind
Jump the fence and
(Leave it all behind)
Daddy's baby Momma's friend
Buy that judge off
(Start all new again)
Matter of factly
Yeah I'll bet he
Never saw you quite this way
Safe to say
Throw the key away
(Whatcha gonna tell your man)
Whatcha gonna tell your man
(How you gonna make him understand)
Understand
Whatcha you have to go and do it for
Make me want you like I do
Baby

(Whatcha gonna tell your man)
Oh whatcha gonna tell your man
(How you gonna make him understand)
Understand
Whatcha have to go and do it for
Make me want you like I do
Baby

Oh whatcha you gonna tell your man
Whatcha you have to go and do it for
Make me.... whatcha whatcha....
Long time we no have no nice time
Do you, do you, do yah, think about that!
Long time we no have no nice time
Do you, do you, do yah, think about that!
This is my heart
To rock you steady

The Time you're ready
This little heart in me

Long time we no have no nice time
Do you, do you, do yah, think about that!

Just won't let me be

Won't you a rock wid me?
A long - long - long - long time we no have no nice time
Thank ya, thank ya, babe!

[Verse 1]
I am a poor wayfaring stranger
Traveling through all these highs and lows
I heard there was no sickness and no toil or danger
Just mercy and plenty where peaceful waters flow
Where peaceful waters flow

[Verse 2]
Come all you fair and tender school girls
Be careful now when you court young men
They are like the stars on a summer morning
They sparkle up the night and they're gone again
Daybreak, gone again

[Verse 3]
If I'd only seen through the silky veils of ardor
What a killing crime this love can be
I would have locked up my heart in a golden sheath of armor
And kept its crazy beating under strictest secrecy
High security

[Verse 4]
I wish I had the wings of Noah's pretty little white dove
So I could fly this raging river to reach the one I love
But I have no wings and the water is so wide
We'll have to row a little harder, it's just in dreams we fly
In my dreams we fly
From Hollywood and Vine
To the Sunset Strip
There's so much going on
You can lose your grip
From early in the morning
Until late at night
They'll do you so wrong
They'll do you so right

Back in L.A
Waiting for the sun to shine
Back in L.A
Living down a life of crime
Back in L.A
Working on another line
Back in L.A
To pick up the dime
You must do the time

From way up in the canyons

Where the hot winds howl
To the mean city streets
Where the night hawks prowl
I can feel the rhythm play
The whole night long
Guess I'll stay in L.A
And listen to this song
Back in L.A
Waiting for the sun to shine
Back in L.A
Living down a life of crime
Back in L.A
Working on another line
Back in L.A
To pick up the dime
You must do the time

You must do the time
Uh uh oh ahhhhhhh radio killa
Taking back my love
Taking back my love
Taking back my love
Taking back my love

You said you changed, but still nothing
You're still the same, I'm just a part time lover

And I'm the blame, should've went away
But yet I stayed, with a part time lover

See, some days you will love me
Then you don't, then you do, then you won't
Then you're here, then you're gone
I'm alone

Now you got me stressing out on the phone
But it's the last time, I'm movin' on
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins

I left the state, changed everything
No more 818, for the part time lover

What goes around, comes back around
And then you get what you deserve
You part time lover

See, some days you will love me
Then you don't, then you do, then you won't
Then you're here, then you're gone
I'm alone

Now you got me stressing out
On the phone
But it's the last time, I'm movin' on
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins

Watch these red bottoms, and the back of my jeans
Watch me go, bye baby
Don't know what you got until it's gone

Tail Lights is all you'll see
Watch this Benz exit that driveway

I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (eh hey eh)

Watch me walk it out
Walk it out, walk it out
Walk this right up out the house
Walk it out watch me walk it out
Walk it out walk this right up out the house
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwin' on my Louboutins (out the house)
Dream to sleep out in the dark
To drown a fragile heart
Am I too young to retire?
Give up, don't prove me a liar
Why would I even try?
Like some vivacious guy?
Just groan and drink and cry
Bright, revealing light
How can I feel alright?
Better than College girls gone wild (woohoo!)
It's more off the chain than Late Night with Miss Cleo
Call me now for your free readin'
Who's the father of the baby?

The same that smiled on you
And time and again, I've thought all the things
That you were thinking too

I have dreamed that your arms are lovely
I have dreamed what a joy you'll be
I have dreamed ev'ry word you'll whisper
When you're close, close to me

How you look in the glow of evening
I have dreamed and enjoyed the view
In these dreams I've loved you
So that by now I think I know
What it's like to be loved by you

*beat fades*
You're nobody till somebody loves you
You're nobody till somebody cares
You might be king, you might possess, the world and its gold
But gold won't bring you happiness, when you're growing old
The world still is the same
You'll never change it
As sure as the stars shine above
You're nobody till somebody loves you
So find yourself somebody to love
May God bless and keep you always
May your wishes always come true
May you always do for others
And let others do for you
May you build a ladder to the stars
And climb on every rung
May you stay forever young

May you grow up to be righteous
May you grow up to be true
May you always know the truth
And see the lights surrounding you
May you always be courageous
Stand upright and be strong
May you stay forever young
Forever young, forever young
May you stay forever young

May your hands always be busy
May your feet always be swift
May you have a strong foundation
When the winds of changes shift
May your heart always be joyful
May your song always be sung
May you stay forever young
Forever young, forever young
May you stay forever young

[Verse 1]
There was a time when I thought life was over and out
When you went away from me
My dying heart made it hard to breathe...
I'd sit in my room, because I didn't want to have to go out
And see you walking by
One look and I'd break right down and cry, cry...

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you say that you made a big mistake
Never meant to take your love away
But you can save your tired apologies
'Coz it may seem hard to believe

[Chorus]
But I... I'm doin' just fine
Gettin' along very well without you in my life
I don't need you in my life
Ooh...but I, I'm doin' just fine
Time made me stronger
You're no longer on my mind...(Ooooh oooh )

[Verse 2]
You were my earth, my number one priority
Gave my love to only you
Anything you'd ask of me I would do, hoo...( Oooh ooh oooh ooh )
Somewhere down the road
You felt a change in the weather and told
Me that you had to journey on...
A kiss in the wind and your love was gone, long gone...

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you say you never meant to play your games
But girl don't you know it's far too late(ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Because you let our love just fall apart(Fall apart)
You no longer have my heart...(You don't have a heart)
And I...(ah ah ah)

[Chorus]
But I... I'm doin' just fine
Gettin' along very well without you in my life
I don't need you in my life
Ooh...but I, I'm doin' just fine(ah ah ah ah ah)
Time made me stronger
You're no longer on my mind...
I don't need you anymore...

[Bridge]
When you said goodbye, I felt so all alone
There were times at night I couldn't sleep
My heart was much too weak to make it on my own
But baby after all the misery and pain you put me through
So unfair to me girl, you're no longer my world
And I ain't missin' you... ( at all)

[Chorus]
But I... I'm doin' just fine
Gettin' along very well without you in my life
I don't need you in my life
Ooh...but I, I'm doin' just fine
Time made me stronger(Time made me stronger)
You're no longer on my mind...(You're no longer on my mind)
Oh oh oh

[Verse 3]
See baby when you walked away (you are just fine)
You didn't think that it would end up this way
But I knew you'd be coming 'round someday
Just as sure as my name is Wanya (ooh ooh ooh)

[Chorus]
But I... I'm doin' just fine
Gettin' along very well without you in my life
I don't need you in my life
Ooh...but I, I'm doin' just fine
Time made me stronger(Time made me stronger)
You're no longer on my mind...(You're no longer on my mind)
Oh oh oh You are no longer on my mind
Ooooh oooh yeah oooh ooh
But I... I'm doin' just fine
Gettin' along very well without you in my life
I don't need you in my life
Ooh...but I, I'm doin' just fine(Yeah oooh oooh ooh)

Well, now you listen, everybody, 'cause I'm talkin' to you
Jesus is the only one can carry you through
Better get you ready 'cause I'm tellin' you why
My Lord is a-comin' from His home on high

Goin' down the valley, goin' one by one
Gonna be rewarded for the things we've done
How you gonna feel about the things you say
On that judgment day? Let me tell you 'bout it

Everybody gonna have religion and glory
Everybody gonna be singin' a story
Everybody gonna have a wonderful time up there

Well, now you listen, hey, my sister, I'm not leavin' you out
You may not be a preacher but you sing and you shout
You'd feel better if you get redeemed, you know
Heaven's even better than a miser's dream

Think of the trouble you can save some soul
Show them how to reach the shining goal
You can teach somebody how to find the light
Make the whole thing right, yes

Everybody gonna have religion and glory
Everybody gonna be singin' the story
Everybody's gonna have a wonderful time up there
(Oh, glory hallelujah)

Brother, there's a reckonin' a-comin' in the mornin'
And you better get you ready 'cause I'm givin' you the warnin'
Everybody's gonna have a wonderful time up there
(Wonderful time up there)

[Verse 1]
Hey everybody, tell me how do you feel?
Are you satisfied with your life, do you think it's real?
Tell me, how is your head, what are your dreams?
Do you have any plans, do you have any scheme?
Do you care about, about anybody?
I'd like to know, is the answer "no"?

[Chorus]
Take me to tomorrow, take me there today
I've had my fill of sorrow and livin' this way
Take me to tomorrow, that's where I'd like to be
The day after tomorrow is waitin' for me

[Verse 2]
Hey everybody, what's on your mind? (I don't know)
Do you think there's nowhere else to go, there's nothing left to find? (I gotta know)
Are you happy where you are, do you have anything to share? (I can't see)
Do you think you're gonna waste your life spending it there? (oh, yeah)
Would you like to find a way out, do you think it's worth a try? (yeah, yeah)
I'd like to know, is the answer "no"?
Well, maybe so

[Chorus]
Take me to tomorrow, take me there today
I've had my fill of sorrow and livin' your way
Take me to tomorrow, that's where I'd like to be
The day after tomorrow is waitin' for me

Take me to tomorrow, take me there today
I've had my fill of sorrow and livin' your way
Take me to tomorrow, that's where I'd like to be
The day after tomorrow is waitin'
The day after tomorrow is waitin'
The day after tomorrow is waitin' for me
(Yeah!)
You're breaking my heart all over again
Oh why did we start all over again?
It's too late now to wish I had never met you
I've loved you much too much to just forget you
If we ever part all over again
Will I fall in love, no never again!
You said you'd love me, you made a vow
Look what you're doing now
You're breaking my heart all over again
Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
Since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
When we finally kiss good night
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
Fire is slowly dying
And, my dear
We're still goodbying
As long as you love me so
Let it snow
Let it snow, let it snow
He doesn't care if it's in below
He's sitting
By the fires glossy glow
He don't care about the cold
And the winds that blow
He just says, let it snow
Let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow
Ooh, wee, goes the storm
Why should he worry
When he's nice and warm?
His girl by his side
And the lights turned low
He just says
Let it snow, let it snow
I don't care
Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But that fire is, mmm, delightful
Since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought lots of corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
So, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow
When we finally say good night
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you'll only hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
Fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbying
Long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Laura is the face in the misty light
Footsteps that you hear down the hall
The LAUGH that floats on a summer night
That you can never quite recall
And you see Laura on a train that is passing through
Those eyes how familiar they seem
She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura but she's only a dream

She gave your very first kiss to you
That was Laura
But she's only a dream
Two eyes walking `round with a baby blue stare, how cute can you be?
Red lips pouting so that a guy's gotta care, how cute can you be?
I've seen lassies, the fine looks and chassis, almost every day
But I've stopped my looking `cause I know what's cooking, just a glance away
Soft hair shining so that the sun blinks his eyes, how cute can you be?
A voice sweet and low, making temperatures rise, how cute can you be?
I'll give up my gallivanting, if you'd consent to be
The ready little steady on my family tree, how cute can you be?
She's got some soft hair shining, that the sun blinks his eyes, hey, how cute can you be?
A voice sweet and low, making temperatures rise, how cute can you be?
I'll give up my gallivanting, if you'd consent to be
The ready little steady on my family tree, how cute can you be?
Baby, how cute can you be? Hubba, how cute can you be?
I got the key to the highway, and I'm billed out and bound to go
I'm gonna leave here runnin', cause walkin' is most too slow
I'm goin' down on the border, now where I'm better known
Cause woman you don't do nothin', but drive a good man 'way from home
Now when the moon creeps over the mountain, I'll be on my way
Now I'm gonna walk this old highway, until the break of day
Come here, sweet mama, now and help me with this heavy load
I am due in West Texas, and I've got to get on the road
I'm goin' to West Texas, I'm goin' down behind the farm(?)
I'm gonna ax the good Lord what evil have I done

[Verse 1]
Heart in my hand
We’ve broken the bread
And I choked on a thread
Again and again
Fist in a ball
My arms as they haul
Away from your body
Away from your skin

[Pre-Chorus]
You see, that’s my twin
She’s standing aside and she’s my next of kin
If only you knew what resided within

[Chorus]
I won’t let her in
That would be callous and crass
A chip on my chin
You don’t want me back

[Verse 2]
Stuck in the dirt
Can you tell that she’s hurt?
So sharp and alert
She’s such a clean breed
Stuck in the mud
I’m a ghost that I was
A sister of her
And I’m all the same Creed

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ll never give in
How could I apprise you with all that she’s sinned
She feels like hell and I know ‘cause I’ve been

[Chorus]
I won’t let her in
That would be callous and crass
A chip on my chin
You don’t want me back

I won’t let her in
That would be callous and crass
A chip on my chin
You don’t want me back
Do you make the most of your five senses
Or is your life like Old Mother Hubbard's shelf?
Well, mark this on your slate
Life is not an empty plate
That's if you appreciate yourself

Ev'ry time you're near a rose
Aren't you glad you've got a nose?
And if the dawn is fresh with dew
Aren't you glad you're you?
When a meadowlark appears
Aren't you glad you've got two ears?
And if your heart is singing, too
Aren't you glad you're you?
You can see a summer sky
Or touch a friendly hand
Or taste an apple pie
Pardon the grammar, but ain't life grand?
And when you wake up each morn
Aren't you glad that you were born?
Think what you've got the whole day through
Aren't you glad you're you?
I have heard of a land on the far away strand
'Tis a beautiful home of the soul
Built by Jesus on high, there we never shall die
'Tis a land where we never grow old

Never grow old, never grow old
In a land where we'll never grow old
Never grow old, never grow old
In a land where we'll never grow old

In that beautiful home where we'll never more roam
We shall be in the sweet by and by
Happy praise to the king thru eternity sing
'Tis a land where we never shall die

When our work here is done and the life crown is won
And out troubles and trials are o'er
All our sorrows will end and our voices will blend
With the loved ones who've gone on before
Well hello pretty baby
I just called to say that we're through
Because I'm so tired of sneakin' around with you

I want to meet you in the sunlight
Not in a secret rendezvous
Because I'm so tired of sneakin' around with you

Oh you never, you're never meant to be mine
I was just too blind to see
Oh but I've got my pride, so why should we hide
When you might as well be free

Oh I love, you know I love you
Oh, and I want to tell the world I do
That's why I'm so tired of sneakin' around with you
Oh I'm so tired of sneakin' around with you
Oh, I'm so tired of sneakin' around with you
So many years ago, I can't remember now
Someone was waiting for me
I had the answers to all of my questions
Love was so easy to see, I didn't know

When I was younger, I should have known better
I thought nothing was new
Through all the spaces, and all of the changes
What I lost sight of was you
I didn't know, I didn't know

I could see you in singing skies and dancing waters
Laughing children growing old
And in the heart and in the spirit
And in the truth when it is told

My life became shady, and I grew afraid
And I needed to find my way home
I just couldn't see you, I thought that I'd lost you
I never felt so much alone, are you still with me
Somehow in reason, I lost sight of seasons
I'm growin' out, growin' in
Sometimes in evenings, when daylight was needed
I thought I'd never see you again
Are you still with me, are you still with me

I'm with you in singing skies and dancing waters
Laughing children growing old
And in the heart and in the spirit
And in the truth when it is told

If my faith should falter
And I should forsake you, and find myself turning away
Will you still be there, will you still be there

I'll be there in singing skies and dancing waters
Laughing children growing old
And in the heart and in the spirit
And in the truth when it is told
Pretend there is no silence, alone in your apartment
Don't notice things that once were hers
Ignore the endless hours
Don't chase the dream that your hearts were after, children's laughter

Somehow believe in living, forget about the giving
Just tell your life it must go on
Run from yourself until you can't be found
But don't remember, refuse to remember
Forget to remember love
(Break, break, shake away)
(Break, break away)
(I did what, did what I wanna do)

Time will not wait for me
Time is my destiny
Why change the part of me
That has to be free

The love that passed me by
I found no reason why
But now each day is filled with the love
That very same love
That passed me by
And that is why

I can break away
From that lonely life
And I can do what I wanna do (I did what, did what I wanna do)
And break away from that empty life
And my world is new
When I laid down on my bed
I heard voices in my head
Tellin' me now hey, it's only a dream

The more I thought of it
I had been out of it
And here's the answer I found instead (baby, baby)
Found out it was in my head (baby, baby)
Found out it was my head (baby, baby)
Found out it was in my head (baby, baby, baby)

And I can break away to the better life
Where the shackles never hold me down
I'm gonna make a way for each happy day
As my life turns around

Oh boy, you'd jump for joy (Come on with me to break away)
When you (Won't you come on with me to break away)
Break away (Come on with me to break away)
Break away (Come on with me to ride away)
Break away (Won't you come on with me to break away)
Break away (Come on with me to ride away)
Feel the vibration
It's an arming sensation (Break away)
Feel the vibration
It's an arming sensation (Break away)
Well up in the evening down in Mobile, Alabama
Working on the railroad with the steel driving hammer
Gotta make some money to buy some brand new shoes
Trying to find somebody to take away these blues
"She don't love me" hear them singing in the sun
Payday's coming and my work is all done

Later in the evening when the sun is sinking low
All day I been waiting for the whistle to blow
Sitting in a tepee built right on the tracks
Rolling them bones until the foreman comes back
Pick up you belongings boys and scatter about
We've got an off-schedule train comin two miles about

Everybody's trembling and running around
Picking up their money, tearing the tepee down
Foreman wants a penny (?) about to go insane
Trying to get the workers out the way of the train
Engineer blowing the whistle loud and long
Can't stop the train, gotta let it roll on

[Intro: Pitbull]
My girl is the kind of girl that walks in this world (Mr. Worldwide)
Other girls want my girl, which I think is cool (Nelly)
My girl is what these other girls wanna be
But that's what she's with me, my kinda girl!

[Chorus: Nelly]
You're like my kinda girl
She walk like my kinda girl
She talk like my kinda girl
I guess my kinda girl is you!
So I think I better get in line
Get in line, get in line
Get in line, get in line, get in line
Yeah, 'cause every nigga in here want you

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
You name it, she's got it, cheating realistic about it
Disrespecting, acting fool in public, I doubt it
If there's skeleton is in the closet
That's where she keeps it
I do business with sharks
So she stays quiet and peeps 'em
Even if she's playing with time
Sequence, she keeps 'em
Never goes through what's mine
She respects the grind
I respect her mind
That's why I made her mine
For me she'll fight the world
And that's my kinda girl

[Chorus: Nelly]
You're like my kinda girl
She walk like my kinda girl
She talk like my kinda girl
I guess my kinda girl is you!
So I think I better get in line
Get in line, get in line
Get in line, get in line, get in line
Yeah, 'cause every nigga in here want you

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
My kind of girl, yeah, she's got a vision!
That's food for thought
Now let 'em haters do the dishes!
A pair of tall heels and her stockings fishnets
And ain't talking fishing
She's got a six sense
Green paper with that 

[?]
Nah, don't impress her
She'll break a full court
So watch how you press her!
She came some nothing 'till she know some
Yeah, that's true!
For me she'll fight the world
And that's my kinda girl!

[Chorus: Nelly]
You're like my kinda girl
She walk like my kinda girl
She talk like my kinda girl
I guess my kinda girl is you!
So I think I better get in line
Get in line, get in line
Get in line, get in line, get in line
Yeah, 'cause every nigga in here want you

[Bridge 1: Pitbull & Nelly]
My girl is the kinda girl that walks in the room
Other girls want my girl, which I think is cool
My girl is what these others girls wanna be
But that's why she's with me, my kinda girl!

[Bridge 2: Nelly]
Sometimes she's bouge, sometimes she's hood
Yeah, she's my town ass bitch!
And when she's with me, she know she's good
Yeah, she's my town ass bitch!

[Chorus: Nelly]
You're like my kinda girl
She walk like my kinda girl
She talk like my kinda girl
I guess my kinda girl is you!
So I think I better get in line
Get in line, get in line
Get in line, get in line, get in line
Yeah, 'cause every nigga in here want you
If melody is my destiny
Then what's left of me
I'll give to you

If next to me
Is all that you need to be
Would you settle for fantasy
If it's the best you could do

Can I have my cake
Can I have you too
Would you follow me
Could I ask you to

Would the world between us
Break these ties
We've work so hard to realize
Can postcard say
What I see in your eyes
Could I ever break away
Would I be satisfied
And find peace inside
Rolling half my life
Over broken white lines

Can I have my cake
Can I have you too
Would you follow me
Could I ask you to

Will I wake up one morning
And see your face
And streaks on the window
That the rainstorm makes
Could you bear all the weight
And the strength that it takes
Could I ever break away

Can I have my cake
Can I have you too
Would you follow me
Could I ask you to

Would the world between us
Break these ties
We've worked so hard to realize
Can a postcard say
What I see in your eyes
Could I ever break away
I see she
Knowing what I came here for
Get a little of your womanifestation
If I can pinpoint this feeling
When you gonna let it grow
We can draw the line on where we
Let the fingers go

Now I know me
Never wanna lose control
Making me the subject
Of your warm initiation
If I can pinpoint this feeling
When you gonna let it show
You make me nervous but it's now or never

Oh Oh
You can be my message from above
And it's time to say you're sorry
We can sanctify our love
Oh no
And you and I we're written in the wind
You can't just go movin' out
You can't leave me when I'm movin' in
I want to be your human sacrifice
I want to be your lover
I want to be your human sacrifice
I want to be your lover
It's you or me
Gotta be a kill or cure
Maybe undergo a lover's operation
Nothing cuts like a knife can
You don't wanna hurt me more
Look at all that damage
We could do together

Oh no
You can wear me closer to the bone
It don't work to make me worry
But the demon seed is sown

Oh no
And you and I we're written in the sky
You can't make me hold on
Better you shoot my love between the eyes

Your eyes on me on this table where I lie
And what I see as fact is fiction
You won't let me die
And I'm bound to be abused
I won't let you cut me loose
This love is out to get you
When the blood begins to flow
Woke up this morning
After another one of those crazy dreams
Oh, nothing is going right this morning
The whole world is wrong it seems
Oh, I guess it's the chains that bind me
I can't shake it loose, these chains and things

Got to work this morning
Seems like everything is lost
I got a cold-hearted, wrong-doing woman
And a slave driving ball
I can't lose these chains that bind me
Can't shake them loose, these chains and things
Mm, just can't lose these chains and things

Well, you talk about hard luck and trouble
Seems to be my middle name
All the odds are against me
Yes, I can only play a losing game
These chains that bind me
Can't lose these chains and things
Mm, just can't lose these chains and things
Oh, I would pack up and leave today, people
But I ain't got nowhere to go
Ain't got no money to buy a ticket
And I don't feel like walking anymore
These chains that bind me
Whoa, I can't lose
I can't lose these chains and things

[Verse 1]
Lord, I want to be a Christian
In my heart, in my heart

Mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah , yeah, yeah

In my heart, in my heart
Lord, I wanna be just, just like Jesus
Oh yes, in my hear
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, in my heart
Let it be so in my heart

[Outro]
For every day and every way
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be just like Jesus
Oh, oh, Lord, I wanna be, wanna be just like Him
I wanna heal the sick, I wanna raise the dead
Even want Your people to be fed
By the words they hear that come out of my mouth
I want You to be in control
Oh, oh, oh, I wanna be, I wanna be, I, I wanna be, I, I wanna be
Just like You, Lord, just like You, Lord
Just like You, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
When people pass me on the street
I want them to know that You're inside of me
When they see me on the stage
I want them to know the change You made
I, I, I wanna be now, I wanna be just like You, Lord
I wanna touch them, I wanna heal them
I wanna give them whatever they need, Lord
I wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna
I wanna be, I wanna be, just like You, Lord
Like you, Lord, just like You
I wanna just like You Lord
Wanna be, wanna be, wanna be
Wanna be, I wanna be, I wanna be
It's my desire
(Girl)
So what are you doing back?

(Man)
Well, I set back and thought about
The things we used to do
It really meant a lot to me
You mean a lot to me

(Girl)
I really mean that much to you?

(Man)
Girl, you know it's true

I'm in love with you, girl, 'cause you're on my mind
You're the one I think about most every time
And when you crack a smile and everything you do
Don't you understand, girl, this love is true?
Your soft, silky hand long, sweet and thin
That candlelight complexion upon your skin
It lightens up my day and that's oh-so true
Together we're one, separated we're two
To make you all mine, all mine is my desire
'Cause you contain a quality that I admire
To put it plain and simple, you rule my world
So try to understand
I'm in love, girl
I'm so in love, girl
I'm just in love, girl, and this is true

Girl, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you
Yes, you know it's true
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you
Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you
Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you

This is some sort of thing, girl, I can't explain
My emotion starts up when I hear your name
Maybe your sweet, sweet voice which ring in my ears
Stimulate my senses, girl, when you are near
And with your positive emotions, lovemakin' and joy
There's no need to bust, it's like a girl and a boy
These feelings I get, I often wonder why
So I thought I might discuss this, girl, just you and I
In this relationship am I askin' too much

[?]
Just take a second to think what has to be done
Apart we are two, but, girl, together we're one
Now what you wear, I don't care, how you 

[?] this before
The reason that I like you, girl, is for what you are
If I sit and think about it, you rule my world
So try to understand

Get you a copper kettle
Get you a copper coil
Fill it with new made corn mash
And never more you'll toil

You'll just lay there by the juniper
While the moon is bright
Watch them jugs a-filling
In the pale moonlight

Build you a fire with hickory
Hickory, ash, and oak
Don't use no green or rotten wood
It'll get you by the smoke

We'll just lay there by the juniper
While the moon is bright
Watch them jugs a-filling
In the pale moonlight

My daddy, he made whiskey
My granddaddy, he did too
We ain't paid no whiskey tax
Since 1792
We'll just lay there by the juniper
While the moon is bright
Watch them jugs a-filling
In the pale moonlight

I'd rather be a sparrow than a snail
Yes I would
If I could
I surely would
I'd rather be a hammer than a nail
Yes I would
If I only could
I surely would

Away, I'd rather sail away
Like a swan that's here and gone
When man gets tied up to the ground
He gives the world its saddest sound
Its saddest sound

I'd rather be a forest than a street
Yes I would
If I could
I surely would
I'd rather feel the earth beneath my feet
Yes I would
If I only could
I surely would
Oh, oo-o-oh, come on, ooh, yeah
Well I tried to tell you so (yes, I did)
But I guess you didn't know, as I said the story goes
Baby, now I got the flow
'Cos I knew it from the start
Baby, when you broke my heart
That I had to come again, and show you that I'm real

(You lied to me) all those times I said that I love you
(You lied to me) yes, I tried, yes, I tried
(You lied to me) even though you know I'd die for you
(You lied to me) yes, I cried, yes, I cried

1-(Return of the Mack) it is
(Return of the Mack) come on
(Return of the Mack) oh my God
(You know that I'll be back) here I am
(Return of the Mack) once again
(Return of the Mack) pump up the world
(Return of the Mack) watch my flow
(You know that I'll be back) here I go
So I'm back up in the game
Running things to keep my swing
Letting all the people know
That I'm back to run the show
'Cos what you did, you know, was wrong
And all the nasty things you've done
So, baby, listen carefully
While I sing my come-back song

2-(You lied to me) 'cos she said she'd never turn on me
(You lied to me) but you did, but you do
(You lied to me) all these pains you said I'd never feel
(You lied to me) but I do, but I do, do, do

(Return of the Mack) here it is
(Return of the Mack) hold on
(Return of the Mack) don't you know
(You know that I'll be back) here I go
(Return of the Mack) oh little girl
(Return of the Mack) once my pearl
(Return of the Mack) up and down
(You know that I'll be back) round and round
(rpt 2, 1)

(You know that I'll be back) don't you know
(Return of the Mack) here it is
(Return of the Mack) hold on
(Return of the Mack) be strong
(You know that I'll be back) here I go
(Return of the Mack) my little girl
(Return of the Mack) once my pearl
(Return of the Mack) up and down
(You know that I'll be back) round and round
She says she's sleeping well
She says she's lost some weight
She says she's seen some shows
She says the city's strange
(So she says)
She says the weather's cold
She says there's been some rain
She says there's lots to see
She says she hopes we're fine
(So she says)
(So she says)
The price is high
High as the sky
And she says
She says
She's comin' home
Sitting here in limbo, but I know it won't be long
Sitting here in limbo, like a bird without a song
Well they're putting up resistance
But I know that my faith will lead me on

Sitting here in limbo, waiting for the dice to roll
Sitting here in limbo, got some time to search my soul
Well they're putting up resistance
But I know that my faith will lead me on

I don't know where life will lead me
But I know where I've been
I can't say what life will show me
But I know what I've seen
Tried my hand at love and friendship
But all that is passed and gone
This little boy is moving on

Sitting here in limbo waiting for the tide to flow
Sitting here in limbo knowing that I have to go
Well they're putting up resistance
But I know that my faith will lead me on
I don't know where life will lead me
But I know where I've been
I can't say what life will show me
But I know what I've seen
Tried my hand at love and friendship
But all that is passed and gone
This little boy is moving on

Sitting here in limbo waiting for the tide to flow
Sitting here in limbo knowing that I have to go
Well they're putting up resistance
But I know that my faith will lead me on

Sitting in limbo
Sitting in limbo

[etc]
I'm gonna call up some of my buddies
And a few of the ladies I know
I'm gonna rent a hall and get them all and
Put on a heck of a show

With a oven and a stove

And man we'll have a ball

Playin' with my friends

We'll have a good time
Playin' with my friends

As long as it's the blues

Playin' with my friends
Playin' with my friends
Playin' with my friends

Playin' with my friends

Small Armada of other boats to help in the
Desperate rescue operation at Dunkirk
I have a girlfriend
She says I'm her only one
We wanna get married
But we're so young
So young
Can't marry no one
They say our love is
Just a teenage affection
But no one knows
Our hearts' direction

So young

[Chorus]
Don't fall in love with me, baby
It's a love that just won't last
Your eyes are lookin' out at the future
But you see the past
You know love was made for a dreamer
But when the dream is out of sight
Well, all you're gonna get in the morning is a lonely night
Gonna be a lonely night, nothing but a lonely night

[Verse]
Saving it all for something wild and wonderful
Holding it down
There's gotta be another horizon
Keep it inside
Don't throw away your precious love
'Cause if you need to be free, you can take it
Not a prison of love that you make it

[Chorus]
Don't fall in love with me, baby
It's a love that just can't last
Your eyes are looking out at the future
But you see the past
You know hearts were made to be broken
And your love has broken mine
Now all your gonna get in the morning is a lonely night
Gonna be a lonely night, nothing but a lonely night
Gonna be a lonely night
You gonna be blue (Don't fall, don't fall)
Gonna be a lonely night, nothing but a lonely night
Gonna be a lonely night

[Verse]
Saving it all for something wild and wonderful
Holding it down
There's gotta be another horizon
Keep it inside
Don't throw away your precious love
'Cause if you need to be free, you can take it
Not a prison of love that you make it

[Chorus]
Don't fall in love with me, baby
It's a love that just can't last
Your eyes are looking out at the future
But you see the past
You know love was made for a dreamer

Beautiful child
Beautiful child
You are a beautiful child
And I am a fool once more

You fell in love when I was only ten
The years disappeared
Much has gone by since then
I bite my lip, can you send me away
You touch
I have no choice
I have to stay
Ooh, I had to stay
Ooh, I had to stay

Sleepless child
There is so little time
Your eyes say yes
But you don't say yes
Well, I wish that you were mine
I wish that you were mine
You say it will be harder in the morning
I wait for you to say, just go
Your hands, held mine so few hours
(I fell into love)
But I'm not a child anymore

I'm not a child anymore
I'm tall enough
To reach for the stars
I'm old enough
To love you from afar
Too trusting, yes
But then women usually are

(I'm not a child anymore)
I'm not a child, oh no
(I'm tall enough to reach for the stars)
I will do as I'm told
(I'm old enough to love you from afar)
Even if I never hold you again
(Too trusting yes, but then women usually are)
Hold you again
(Hold you again)

Sleepless child
There is so little time
(I will do as I am told)
Your eyes say yes
But you don't say yes
(Even if I never hold you again)
I wish that you were mine
(Hold you again)
I wish that you were mine
(Even if I never hold you again)
Well I wish that you were mine
(Hold you again)
Well I wish that you were mine
(Hold you again)
(I'm not a child anymore)
Hands across the table while the lights are low
Though you hush your lips, your finger tips
Tell me all I want to know

Hands across the table meet so tenderly
And they say in their little way
That you belong to me

Hands across the table they meet so tenderly
And they say in their little way
That you belong to me
Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"
I say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are

Yeah, her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh her laugh, she hates, but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for, then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are

The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing just the way you are

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are, yeah
I've lost the right to say that I love you
I've lost the right to say that you are fine
Yes, I've lost the right to say that I love you baby
And I've lost the right to say that you are fine
I've lost the right to say that I need you like I do now baby
And I'm slowly losing my mind

Oh, you once told me how much you love me
And I said God love us all
Oh, you told me once how much you love me baby
And I said God love us all
Yes, I was young and just a fool then baby
And couldn't hear the lovers call

Oh, now I'm all alone and here waiting baby
I have no one to call my own
Yes, I'm all alone and I'm here waiting baby
I have no one to call my own
Yes, you are just a fool each lonely heartbeat says
Now I wonder why was I born

[Verse 1: DMX]
Have you ever got up smiling, laid down crying
First you love life then wish you were dying
Bitch so fed up gave up trying
Kept it straight up but niggas kept lying
Ever seen something that you wanted so bad
And got it then wished it was something you never had
You ever been so lost than you thought you won't make it
If you ever been forced to do something you couldn't take it
You ever felt so strong or so loved
But when it came down it wasn't meant to be so hard
Wake yourself up like, where did I go wrong!?
Just get back up, pray on it and go on

[Hook:]
Have you eva been up, ever been down
Ever been lost, then came around
Ever been through it then came outta there
Never had it, then got a lot of it
Have you eva been up, ever been down
Ever been lost, then came around
Ever been through it then came outta there
Never had it, then got a lot of it

[Verse 2: DMX]
Ever wanted to go right, then shows left
He down with a lift to way shows death
Burn in the night but everyday shows stress
Regardless of what you think I'm going in that
Have you ever wished upon a star that really wasn't there
Gaze so in your heart, but really didn't care
Stand out at the wrong turn and now life ain't fair
And all you can do is take it, like ye
Ever found out that the shit you was living with
Deeper, cause to me is tryin' to creep ya
Back your Glock off put your ass in a sleeper
Used to be my dog, now he's the Grim Reaper

[Hook:]
Have you eva been up, ever been down
Ever been lost, then came around
Ever been through it then came outta there
Never had it, then got a lot of it
Have you eva been up, ever been down
Ever been lost, then came around
Ever been through it then came outta there
Never had it, then got a lot of it

[Bridge:]
Ever seen something that you didn't want to see
Had to be something that you didn't want to be
Had to kill a nigga that looked just like me
Wanted to believe to have a trust like me
I seen the dark, I seen the light
I seen the day, I seen the night
I seen the wrong, I seen the right
I seen the start, I seen the final

[Hook x2:]
Have you eva been up, ever been down
Ever been lost, then came around
Ever been through it then came outta there
Never had it, then got alot of it
Have you eva been up, ever been down
Ever been lost, then came around
Ever been through it then came outta there
Never had it, then got alot of it

[Verse 1]
Girl, I see you crying
Tears running down your face
You're sick of him lying
Need someone to take his place

I can give you what you ask for
I can give you what you need
I'm down with anything you're down for
Baby, you can count on me

[Chorus]
Whatcha need is someone that cares for you
Whatcha need is someone to see you through
Good times and bad
'Cause you won't ever have to be sad, baby
Whatcha need is someone that cares for you
Whatcha need is someone to see you through
Good times and bad

[Verse 2]
You say that you are lonely
Need someone to hold you tight
You're faithful to him only
But he never treats you right, no

I'll be right there by your side (by your side)
And whenever you're crying
I'll be there tonight, oh I

[Chorus]
Whatcha need is someone that cares for you
Whatcha need is someone to see you through
Good times and bad
You'll never have to be sad, baby

Friendship...trust...commitment

[Chorus]
Whatcha need is someone that cares for you
Whatcha need is someone to see you through
Good times and bad
You'll never have to be sad baby

Whatcha need is someone to see you through
Good times and bad

[Outro: Michael McCary]
The one thing that matters is your happiness
And I wanna be the one that makes you happy
Let me be the one, I'll give you whatcha need
Art Garfunkel: This is Art Garfunkel, formerly of Simon and Garfunkel. I'm here in the studio to talk about something that's very important to me. You know, a lot of people feel that when an important recording group, such as…

Paul Simon: Art?

Garfunkel: Yeah

Simon: Let me interrupt you a minute. It's not quite serious sounding enough. Try to make it a little bit more, uhh, grave

Garfunkel: Okay. This is Arthur Garfunkel, once of Simon and Garfunkel. One of the things that's disturbed me through the years has been people's reaction to The Breakup of Simon and Garfunkel

Simon: Artie? Try and play a little bit more on…emphasize the word "disturbed."

Garfunkel: One of the things that has disturbed me through the years has been people's reaction to The Breakup of Simon and Garfunkel. You know, a lot of people have taken it as a comic event and have not realized that only with deep, real feelings of separate commitment can such…

Simon: I like that. I like that part about the "separate commitment."

Garfunkel: …can such a breakup actually take place. Only by two, separate individuals pursuing their own individual paths and following, what to they is, the God of their own choice can two people who were once so close end up…

Simon: Art? Art, try and work it in that I'll be doing a major college tour this fall

Garfunkel: …who were once so close, follow two paths which are so divergent, whereby, I, for example, record material that I feel expresses my soul, and you, Paul, who are doing a major college tour (laughs) this fall… (laughs and exits studio laughing)
All the beautiful strangers who held me for a night
And fell down in the darkness on pillows soft and white
All the beautiful strangers, all in the afternoon
Who praised my flat little summer, and came back to my room
All the beautiful strangers, they spoiled me for a time
And they taught me neon's just as nice as afternoon sunshine
When I first met you baby, I didn't even know your name
Yes, when I first met you babe, I didn't even know your name
I was feeling so low on the ground
Bad luck and evil women was to blame

I never realized just how sweet and kind one woman can be
Yes, I never realized, people, just how sweet and kind one woman can be
Yes, but when I looked in your eyes
Yeah, I knew true love had come to me
Yeah

Take my hand, baby, now, you hold it tight and don't let go
Take my hand, now, hold it tight and don't let go
Yes, 'cause our love is like a merry go round
And 'round forever it's gonna go
We don't own this place, though we act as if we did
It's a loan from the children of our children's kids
The actual owners haven't even been born yet

Bur we never tend the garden and rarely we pay the rent
Most of it is broken and the rest of it is bent
Put it all on plastic and I wonder where we'll be when the bills hit

We can run
But we can't hide from it
Of all possible worlds
We only got one:
We gotta ride on it
Whatever we've done
We'll never get far from what we leave behind
Baby, we can run, run, run, but we can't hide
Oh no, we can't hide

I'm dumpin' my trash in your back yard
Makin' certain you don't notice really isn't so hard
You're so busy with your guns and all of your excuses to use them
Well, it's oil for the rich and babies for the poor
We got everyone believin' that more is more
If a reckoning comes, maybe we will know what to do then

All these complications seem to leave no choice
I heard the tongues of billion speak with just one voice
Saying, "Just leave all the rest to me
I need it worse than you, you see."
And then I heard....
The sound of one child crying

Today I went walking in the amber wind
There's a hole in the sky where the light pours in
I remembered the days when I wasn't afraid of the sunshine

But now it beats down on the asphalt land
Like a hammering blow from God's left hand
What little still grows cringes in the shade till the night time

If she look like her, act like her, holla at me, hook it up

Kells I see you pimpin in the club with the baddest chick
If she got a partner, tell her she should get with this
A well known money maker H-U-E-Y

The type that would take her out the hood
Make sure her hair and her nails look good

As long as you understand its 50-50
You do for me, I do for you
You shoot for me and I'd shoot for you
You be sweet to me and im sweet to you
You may think im lyin but it's the truth
Cause I ain't gotta lie to kick it

But imma gonna make you my mistress
To avoid the life- lookin ruff
Head and attitude- all messed up
All ya gotta do is holler at kells
And tell him go on hook it up

If she got a friend hommie, tell your girl to hook it up
If she got a cousin hommie, tell your girl to hook it up
If she got a sister hommie, tell your girl to hook it up
If she look like her, act like her, holla at me hook it up

If she lookin for that real love, tell your girl to hook it up
If she look like her, act like her, holla at me, hook it up
If she like real playas and don't f**k with no haters
Wanna get with a real balla that's makin that real paper
If she want a good life shop, hop out fancy cars
Award shows, party mingle with the stars
Now if she understand that I am her blaming man
And when comes to sellin out shes my sold out crowd
And if shes not the type that got a lot boyfriends
Then tell your girl to holler at her future boyfriend

If she got a friend hommie, tell your girl to hook it up
If she got a cousin hommie, tell your girl to hook it up
If she got a sister hommie, tell your girl to hook it up

Kells my nigga
Yea
We in the club see that exit sign girl walk it out
We in the club see that exit sign girl walk it out
Walk it out
Yea
This might be the remix
Sometimes
I got worried wo, ho
I don't know what to do
Because the women that I'm loving
Is breaking my heart in two

I remember way back
When all the money
The money was rolling in
My women was good to me
And I had a lot of friends

Oh, but now I'm getting older
Whoa and the money
The money it's coming in slow
And now that women she put me
I'm not wanted anymore

Yeah, my women, my women
Doesn't want me
I'm not wanted, not wanted anymore
Here we are, out of cigarettes
Holding hands and yawning, look how late it gets
Two sleepy people, by dawn's early light
And too much in love to say good night

Here we are in the cozy chair
Pickin' on a wishbone from the Frigidaire
Two sleepy people with nothing to say
And too much in love to break away

Do you remember the nights we used to linger in the hall?
Your father didn't like me, at all
Do you remember the reason why we married in the fall?
To rent this little nest and get a bit of rest, well

Here we are, just about the same
Foggy little fella, drowsy little dame
Two sleepy people with nothing to say
And too much in love to break away

Two sleepy people, by dawn's early light
And too much in love to say good night
Two sleepy people with nothing to say
And too much in love to break away

Do you remember the nights we used to linger in the hall?
Your father didn't like me, at all
Do you remember the reasons why we married in the fall?
To rent this little nest and get a bit of rest, well

Here we are, just about the same
Foggy little fella, drowsy little dame
Two sleepy people, by dawn's early light
And too much in love to say good night
If they asked me, I could write a book
About the way you walk and whisper and look
I could write a preface on how we met
That the world will never forget

And the simple secret of the plot
Is just to tell them that I love you a lot
Then the world discovers as my book ends
How to make two lovers of friends

(If they asked me, I could write a book)
(About the way you walk and whisper and look)
(I could write a preface on how we met)
(So the world would never forget, never never forget)

And the simple secret of the plot
Is just to tell them that I love you a lot
Then the world discovers as my book ends
How to make two lovers of friends
Yeah, I'm just motherfuckin in the studio and shit...
Chillin with this nigga DMX

Aight

Trying to let all these people out there know more about my nigga
Yameen, yo, to all that don't know, tell these motherfuckas where you from, yo

Yonkers, dog, Y.O

Yeah

School Street, Home of The Brave

But yo, motherfuckin, I've been checkin out, you know, this "Stop Being Greedy" shit

Yeah

Know what I'm sayin? C-could explain-explain-explain what it is?
I'm hearing like two people!
This shit is really complicated
I'm not-I'm not a regular nigga when it comes to a flow, ya'meen?
Is like we all got 2 sides, ya'meen?

Uhm

It depends on what side of the bed you wake up on
That would dep-that would depend on who you gon be for that day, ya'meen?
Sometimes you wake up on some bullshit
Sometimes you wake up like "Yo, it's lovely outside, things are good"
And you gon be that nigga for the day, ya'meen?

Uhm

But... There's always 2 sides, dog, ya'meen?
And that's what's that "Stop Being Greedy" it's all about
It's like I'm showin niggas 2 sides

Uhm
I-i-i-it's like, you-you-you touchin on these rap cats out here
You know what I'm sayin, all these niggas. all these niggas out here, you know...

I'm tellin niggas to stop being greedy! Ya'meen?
I been doin this shit for while, yo!

Right
For mad years, yo!

Uhm

Ya'meen, and... it's like, you know, closing the door
You know, so it's like "yo, stop being greedy, man!
You know, Ima bite you! Stop being greedy!
You know, don't make me take the food!"
You know? Everyday...

Right, right...
And-and how-how's-how-how's-how's the rhyme-how's the rhyme go?

Matter fact, matter fact!
Ima hit you like this
Cuz this-this-this, ya'meen
And then you will can see what's it all about
Ya'meen, for that "Stop Being Greedy" joint
Two sides, ya'meen?
This is the cool nigga, you know, the positive nigga:
"I could flip that flow, I could stick that hoe
I could get that dough, you know I'm with that, yo
Anything about the shit I came thru
I haven't seen
But when it gets dark
It's like a nigga's having dreams."
Having dreams
Then is that bad nigga
"All nightmares, the light dares to desert me
Got me like 'Everybody wants to hurt me'
Paranoid, so I strike out at whatever
Closest thing to me is gon get it, but never!"
Ya'meen, so it's like
You see the confrontation of the good and the bad
And when you hear the beat change
You hear the personally change
Uhm
When I take my sugar to tea
All the boys are jealous of me
'Cause I never take her where the gang goes
When I take my sugar to tea

I'm a rowdy dowdy, that's me
She's a high hat baby, that's she
So I never take her where the gang goes
When I take my sugar to tea

Every Sunday afternoon
We forget about our cares
Rubbing elbows at the Ritz
With those millionaires

When I take my sugar to tea
I'm as ritzy as I can be
'Cause I never take her where the gang goes
When I take my sugar to tea

[Instrumental Interlude]
Every Sunday afternoon
We forget about those cares
Rubbing elbows at the Ritz
With those zillionaires

When I take my sugar to tea
I'm as ritzy as I can be
'Cause I never take her where the gang goes
When I take, take my sugar to tea
I sure had a wonderful time last night
Least wise they tell me I did

I sure had a wonderful time last night
Really blew my lid

Went to a party, I recollect that much
But after four or five, you know I lost my touch
I sure had a wonderful time last night
Least wise they tell me I did

I had a whale of good time last night
Really got myself some kicks
I sure had a wonderful time last night
Took me right back to the sticks

Between that hillbilly band and old Uncle Zeke
And that new atomic beverage that they called "Sneaky Pete"

I sure had a wonderful time last night
Least wise they tell me I did
Sure had a wonderful time last night
Don't know how I got to bed

Sure had a wonderful time last night
Come here, feel this lump on my head

They say I got kinda noisy
And started to shout
Four big bouncers grabbed me
But I threw them out
I sure had a wonderful time last night
Least wise they tell me I did

Sure had a wonderful time last night
Really had myself some fun

Sure had a wonderful time last night
Didn't get home until about half past one

You know I'd like to take you with me the next time I go
But where the heck was it?
Sure would like to know
But I sure had a wonderful time last night

[Verse 1]
Here it comes, here it comes
I can feel the hills exploding
Exploding gracefully, burning up the freeway
Here it comes

[Chorus 1]
Grass is green at the edge of the bubble
Beautiful kids into beautiful trouble
Well, it seems to fall out of the sky and come down on you
Oh baby, burn

[Verse 2]
Fast Toyota, burns rubber
Useless rockers from England
Good times had by all
Just swallow your guilt and your conscience

[Chorus 2]
Blue and white birds stepping hard on the pedal
Interstate Five runs straight down the middle
And it seems to fall out of the sky and come down on you
Oh baby, burn
Ask me who was the first man
To make a fire in the night
I don't know
Oh Lord I don't know
Ask me who thought of using
A candle for a light
I don't know
Oh Lord I don't know

But ask me how does a man feel
When he's got the blues
And I'd say
Misused abused down-hearted and blue
Know the reason I know this
Is cause the blues is all I was left with

Ask me why does a man
Have to reach beyond his need
I don't know
Lord have mercy I don't know
And ask me why does a tree
Have to shed its leaves
I don't know
Lord have mercy I don't know
Ask me how does a man feel
When he's got the blues
And I'd say
Misused abused down-hearted and blue
Know the reason I know this
Is cause the blues is all I was left with

Oh I could tell you how it feels
When you got a dirty deal
I could even tell you how it hurts
When you been stepped on
And treated just like dirt

Ask me why do all good things
Have to come to an end
I don't know
Lord have mercy I don't know
You see
Ask me nothin but about the blues
The blues is all that I was left with
Oh I could tell you how it feels
When you got a dirty deal
Tell you how it hurts
When you been stepped on and stepped on
And stepped on and treated just like dirt
Ask me nothin but about the blues
The blues is all that I was left with
The music stopped
But we were still dancing
Which goes to show
That music has charm

The lights were low
So we kept on dancing
I felt the glow
Of you in my arms

The band had left the stand
And we were in heaven
Dancing on a cloud
Way off in the blue

The music stopped
And people were glancing
But we went on dancing
For we didn't know
Because the lights were low
And we were in love
The band had left the stand
And we were in heaven
Dancing on a cloud
Way off in the blue

The music stopped
And people were glancing
But we went on dancing
For we didn't know
Because the lights were low
And we were in love
Seems to me like the days are getting longer
For everyone there's no fun when there's no time to sleep
Working on and on for a day in the sun
Counting down the days to it stops (every day)

Can you hear us?
Watch the sun on my skin
And the world that I'm in
Makes me delirious

Can you hear us?
With a smile on my face
And it's far to complete
I'm delirious

Can you hear us?
Watch the sun on my skin
And the world that I'm in
Makes me delirious

Can you hear us?
With a smile on my face
And it's far to complete
I'm delirious
Take me away make me a holiday!
Delirious
Take me away make me a holiday!
Delirious

Under the sun I feel I'm getting stronger
Time to rewind my mind and recharge my batteries
'Cause it takes so long
And too soon it's gone
Holding back the days to my reality (yeah)

Take me away, make me a holiday
Take me away, make me a holiday
Delirious

Can you hear us?
Watch the sun on my skin
And the world that I'm in
Makes me delirious

Can you hear us?
With a smile on my face
And it's far to complete
I'm delirious

Can you hear us?
Watch the sun on my skin
And the world that I'm in
Makes me delirious
Can you hear us?
With a smile on my face
And it's far to complete
I'm delirious

Ohh yeah yeah
Ohh
Delirious
Ohh ohh
Ohh yeah
Yeah yeah yeah

Can you hear us?
Watch the sun on my skin
And the world that I'm in
Makes me delirious

Can you hear us?
With a smile on my face
And it's far to complete
I'm delirious

Can you hear us?
Watch the sun on my skin
And the world that I'm in
Makes me delirious
Can you hear us?
With a smile on my face
And it's far to complete
I'm delirious
On my way to sunny California
On my way to spend another sunny day

Water, water get yourself in the cool, clear, water
The sun shines brightly down on Penny's place
The sun shines brightly down on the bay
The air's so clean it'll just take your mind away
Take your mind away
Take your mind away

Have you ever been south of Monterey
Barrancas carve the coast line and the chaparral flows to the sea
'Neath waves of golden sunshine
And have you ever been north of Morro Bay
The south coast plows the sea
And the people there are of the breed
They don't need electricity
Water, water, cool cascades of clear, clear water
The sun dance final scene sets the hills ablaze
Horizon edges quick up the mountain's way
Have you ever been down Salinas way?
Where Steinbeck found the valley
And he wrote about it the way it was in his travelin's with Charley
And have you ever walked down through the sycamores
Where the farmhouse used to be
There the monarch's autumn journey ends
On a windswept cyprus tree

Water get water get yourself in that
Get yourself in that get yourself in that cool, clear, water
The sun shines brightly down on Penny's place
Get yourself in that water
The air's so clean that it just takes your mind away
Take your mind away
Take your mind away

Have you ever been to a festival, the Big Sur congregation?
Where Country Joe will do his show
And he'd sing about liberty
And the people there in the open air, one big family
Yeah the people there love to sing and share
Their new found liberty
The very thought of you makes my heart sing
Like an April breeze on the wings of spring
And you appear in all your splendor
My one and only love

The shadows fall and spread their mystic charms
In the hush of night while you're in my arms
I feel your lips so warm and tender
My one and only love

The touch of your hand is like heaven
A heaven that I've never known
The blush on your cheek
Whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own

You fill my eager heart with such desire
Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire
I give myself in sweet surrender
My one and only love
The touch of your hand is like heaven
A heaven that I've never known
And the blush on your cheek
Whenever I speak
Tells me that you are my own

You fill my eager heart with such desire
Every kiss you give sets my soul on fire
I give myself in sweet surrender
My one and only love

My one and only love

[Verse 1]
I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Whoa, whoa, whoa

[Verse 2]
I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Keep playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice
I won't say goodbye anymore

[Chorus 2]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice
Cause I won't say goodbye anymore
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breakin' in front of me
She said goodbye too many times before

[Outro until Fade]

[guitar solo]

[Verse 1]
You got crazy legs, you got amazing head
You got rings on your fingers and your hair's hot red
You got the width of my tongue, name on the sun
I clutch you close to my breast 'cause you're the only one
Who uses school to pleasure

[Verse 2]
You make me act real gone, you make me troll along
I had to ravish your capsule, suck you dry
Feel the teeth in your bones, heal ya head with my own
Why if I don't have you whole, is that your final love?
Here all together

[Chorus]
Velvet goldmine, you stroke me like the rain
Snake it, take it, panther princess you must stay
Velvet goldmine, naked on your chain
I'll be your king volcano, right for you again and again
My velvet goldmine

[Verse 3]
You're my taste, my trip, I'll be your master zip
I'll chop your hair off for kicks, you'll make me jump to my feet
So you'll give me your hand, give me your sound
Let me sea wash your face, I'm falling, I can't stand
Ooh, clutch your makeup

[Chorus]
Velvet goldmine, you stroke me like the rain
Snake it, take it, panther princess you must stay
Velvet goldmine, naked on your chain
I'll be your king volcano, right for you again and again
My velvet goldmine

[Bridge]
Oh
Shoot you down, bang, bang

[Chorus]
Velvet goldmine, you stroke me like the rain
Snake it, take it, panther princess you must stay
Velvet goldmine, naked on your chain
I'll be your king volcano, right for you again and again
My velvet goldmine

[Outro]
(hum) Velvet Goldmine (repeat)
Yellow diamonds in the light
Now we’re standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive
It’s the way I’m feeling I just can’t deny
But I’ve gotta let it go
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
Shine a light through an open door
Love a life I will divide
Turn away cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind
It’s the way I’m feeling I just can’t deny
But I’ve gotta let it go
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
Yellow diamonds in the light
Now we’re standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

[Verse 1]
Seems so long you've been gone
I've been singing such a sad sad song
I'm glad I found you
Glad my worlds around you

Dinah I've been lonely for you
Never knew how I cared for you
Glad you're back
Take you back in my arms

[Chorus]
Dinah Flo love you so
Take me down way down slow
My Dinah Flo
Love you more each day

[Verse 2]
I'll be long I'll be true
But I can't say what Dinah might do
I'm glad she's back
Take her back in my arms

[Chorus]
Dinah Flo don't let go
Take me down girl nice and slow
Dinah Flo
Love you more each day

[Verse 3]
Oh my Dinah Flo come on lets go
Get that groove down way down slow
Dinah Flo
Love you more each day

Oh my Dinah Flo don't let go
Take me down girl nice and slow
My Dinah Flo
Love you more each day hey hey

[Chorus]
Dinah Flo love you so
Love you more ever so
Dinah Flo love you more each day

[Verse 1: Nathan Morris]
Do you remember when
We would gaze upon
The heavens up above
Revealed within the night
Took turns in looking thru
A telescope discovering
A little star that smiled right back at us
I never strayed away far from all the crowds
A hint of solitude
Concealed behind your smile
Remember when the lights went out that summer's eve
We stumbled in the dark and kissed beneath the stars

[Pre-Chorus: Nathan Morris]
Wonder if it's possible to ever know
How many dreams I've cherished since that time ago
People only dream, when they close their eyes at night
But I'll open up my eyes, hey

[Chorus: Nathan Morris, Boyz II Men]
Wonder if it's possible to ever know
All the skies I've journeyed through and touched before
(Touched before)
Some rely on fate
But it's not the only way
This is my destiny
And this is my will
(This is my will)

[Verse 2: Shawn Stockman]
The sparkle in the night
Glitter in the sky
Each star we see tonight
Have all been here before
There really has to be
Some place nobody has seen
And there we'll start anew
Future for me and you

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Stockman]
Memories illuminate in harmony
Like a constellation bound in unity
Tho they used to sing
So scattered through the sky
I recognize the beauty

[Chorus: Shawn Stockman, Boyz II Men]
Memories in circle all around me
Illustrating passage through this journey
Confirming my belief, this is no coincidence (No)
This is my destiny
This is my will
(This is my will)

[Bridge: Wanya Morris]
Horizons I have crossed in the past
Chapters in the story of my life
Oh oh oh oh, all the midnight skies
Are promising forever more
I'm reaching out to soar

[Pre-Chorus: Wanya Morris]
I wonder if it's possible to ever know
How many dreams I've cherished since that time ago
See, people they only dream
When they close their eyes at night
But I'll open up my eyes, whoa-oh-oh

[Outro: Wanya Morris]
I wonder if it's possible to ever know
All the skies I've journeyed through and touched before
Some rely on fate, but it's not the only way
This is my destiny
Oh, this is my will
I'm so afraid of night 'cause I'm too romantic
Moonlight and stars can make such a fool of me
You know you're much too near, and I am too romantic
Wouldn't I be a sight on a bended knee
I'm startled when you whisper, I'll run if you should sigh
I must be so careful, or I'll kiss my heart goodbye
You shouldn't let me dream 'cause I'm too romantic
Don't make me fall unless it could all come true

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Stretching out your tightness
Good enough to make you grow
We are all in favor of this motion
Stretching out your tightness
Time to open up your hole
When it rains, I let myself get wet
I have always wanted to
Give something to my brother
Proposing to expose your head
To something that is like no other
Hit it

[Chorus]
I'll stretch you out
I'll stretch you out, my friend
I'll stretch you out

[Verse 2]
The juice that flows from intuition
Is my liquid friend
We are all in favor of the open end
Three pounds of love and knowledge
Are expanding in my skull
Truth be told, we let the good times roll
I have always needed to
Receive it and believe it
And it's braiding and creating love
Tender titillation

[Chorus]
I'll stretch you out
I'll stretch you out, my friend
I'll stretch you out

[Bridge]
I'm a fish and I can swim all day
I can swim in so many ways
Make it up as I go along
That way it is never wrong
I'm a bird and I can fly away
I can shift in so many shapes
Make it up as I go along
That way it is never wrong
Owwwwwwww....

[Verse 3]
There's a glowing offer up around the moon
It's showing
We want to play in the water that is flowing
Very legendary
Extra planetary fairy
Very true, she's making just for you
Yes I have always wanted to
Give something to the stranger
M-m-m-moving to improve the groove
A mental transformation

[Chorus]
I'll stretch you out
I'll stretch you out again
I'll stretch you out
Fuckin' posers
Yo yo yeah, yo yo yeah, yo yo yeah, yo yo yeah, uh, yeah
Fuckin' posers, it's almost over now, it's almost over now
For all you fuckin' posers, yeah
It's almost over now,it's almost over now
You think the way you live's okay
You think posing will save your day
You think we don't see that you're running
Let her call your boys 'cause I'm coming

[Chorus:]
You can't be me I'm a rock star
I'm rhymin' on the top of a cop car
I'm a rebel and my four four pops far so
It's almost over now, it's almost over now
Guess you ain't heard that we swallow guys
It's too damn late to apologize
When you see the mental or when you see the skies
It's almost over now, Almost over now
You think that you don't have to ever quit
You think that you can get away with it
You think that life won't be ever lit
It's almost over now, Almost over now
Somethin' on your chest better get it off
There'll be no one left when we set it off
We ain't gon' take it no more
Since it's almost over now, Almost over now
You had plenty of time, there was no rush
But it was your dream to be like us
You're in dreamland so you don't care
And as you wait we're standing there

[Chorus:]
You think that you don't have to ever quit
You think that you can get away with it
You think that life won't be ever lit
It's almost over now, almost over now
Somethin' on your chest better get it off
There'll be no one left when we set it off
We ain't gon' take it no more
Since it's almost over now, almost over now
It's almost over now, it's almost over now
You don't succeed, 'cause you hesitate
You think we're flyin but we'll levitate
Just be yourself, don't ask us why
'Cause if you don't, we'll make you fly

[Chorus:]
You think that you don't have to ever quit
You think that you can get away with it
You think that life won't be ever lit
Well It's almost over now, almost over now
Somethin' on your chest better get it off
There'll be no one left when we set it off
We ain't gon' take it no more
Since it's almost over now, Almost over now

[Chorus:]
No one ever really dies
You believe that?
Well if not, for you
It's almost over now, almost over now
No one ever really dies
I'm watching you by star track
Comin' to a theater near you
There are things that mean alot to me
(Precious)
Some are more important than others
But theres nothing more precious than my baby
(Precious)

It looks like the sun is gone
Here I sit all night long
Thinkin bout my baby shes on my mind
Well all of my friends stop by
But I just can't deny, I rather chill with my lady tonight
Because our lovin is strong and shes got it goin on
She swept me off my feet
Shes so unique..
And she'll come with me
Shes got my back in every way
And so im not afriad to stop and say, ooohh

It is much to long
Since I had a love this strong
I can't resist the temptations of life
And I must confess to you..
Your type of love is new
When Im with you everything is alright
Because your lovin' is bold, and it'll keep me from the cold
What I need is your love
Your precious love
And she'll come with me
Shes got my back in every way
So Im not afraid to stop and say ooohh

When Jenny was a little girl, she only dreamed of trains
She never played with dolls or lacy kinds of things
Jenny counted boxcars instead of counting sheep
She could go anywhere when she went to sleep

All she ever talked about was getting on to ride
She was living in another time you could see it in her eyes
And every day after school she'd head down to the track
Waiting for the train that was never coming back

Jenny dreamed of trains
When the nighttime came
Nobody knew how she made it come true
Jenny dreamed of trains

The depot's been boarded up, the rails have turned to rust
There hasn't been a train through here since the mill went bust
No one believed her when she said she heard the train
Said she was just a little girl acting kind of strange

Jenny dreamed of trains
When the nighttime came
Nobody knew how she made it come true
Jenny dreamed of trains
Jenny laid a penny on the track one day
In God we trust she walked away
The very next morning all she could find
Was a little piece of copper squashed flatter than a dime

Jenny dreamed of trains
When the nighttime came
Nobody knew how she made it come true
Jenny dreamed of trains

Nobody knew how she made it come true
Jenny dreamed of trains

Words and Music by Vince Gill and Guy Clark
Mama told me
When I was young
Come sit beside me
My only son
And listen closely
To what I say
And if you do this it'll help you some sunny day (Oh yeah)

Oh take your time
Don't live too fast
Troubles will come
And they will pass
Go find a woman
And you'll find love
And don't forget son, there is someone up above

And be a simple kind of man
Oh be somethin' you love and understand
Baby be a simple kind of man
Oh won't you do this for me son, if you can?
Forget your lust
For the rich man's gold
All that you need
Is in your soul
And you can do this
If you try
All that I want for you my son, is to be satisfied

And be a simple kind of man
Oh be somethin' you love and understand
Baby be a simple kind of man
Oh won't you do this for me son, if you can? (Oh yes I will)

Boy don't you worry
You'll find yourself
Follow your heart
And nothing else
And you can do this, oh babe, if you try
All that I want for you my son, is to be satisfied

And be a simple kind of man
Oh be somethin' you love and understand
Baby be a simple kind of man
Oh won't you do this for me son, if you can?

Baby be a simple, be a simple man
Oh be somethin' you love and understand...
I like your eyes
I like your nose
I like your mouth
Your ears, your hands, your toes

I like you face
It's really you
I like the things you say and do

There's not a single soul
Who sees the skies
The way you see them
Through your eyes
And aren't you glad
You should be glad
There's no one, no one
Exactly like you
You better leave now, take what you need, the past is past
Whatever you wanna keep, you better grab it fast
Over there's your orphan with her gun
Cryin' like a fire in the sun
Look out the saints are comin' through
Ohh and it's all over now, Baby Blue

The highway is for gamblers, better use good sense
Take what you have gathered from coincidence
The empty-handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets
The sky of blue is moving over you
Ohh it's all over now, Baby Blue

All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home
Your reindeer navigators, they are going home
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore
Strike another match go start anew
Ohh because it's all over now, Baby Blue
Leave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you
Pities against no mind, they will not follow you
Your lover fool has just walked through the door
Has taken all his blankets from your floor
Your fancy rug is moving under you
Ohh and it's all over now, Baby Blue
Intense silence
As she walked in the room
Her black robes trailing
Sister of the moon
And a black widow spider makes
More sound than she
And black moons in those eyes of hers
Made more sense to me
Heavy persuasion
It was hard to breathe
She was dark at the top of the stairs
And she called to me

And so I followed
As friends often do
I cared not for love, nor money
I think she knew
Well, the people they still love her
And still they are the most cruel
She asked me
Be my sister, sister, sister of the moon
Some call her sister of the moon
Some say illusions are her game
They like to wrap her in velvet
Does anyone, ooo...know her name
I woke up this morning and looked at my life
Filled with so much sorrow and grief
And in my troubled mind
I could see through all my strife
That time is only a thief

Yes time is a thief
That will steal your tomorrow's
And leave you only yesterday
Yes time is a thief
That will rob you of your years

Your youth the only ransom you can pay
So treasure each little moment
Don't let a single minute slip away
Because time is a thief
That will rob you of your years
And never return one yesterday

Oh time is a thief
That will rob you of your years
And never return one yesterday
Neither God nor master
See the importance of the world without
Without importance
See the importance

[Verse 1]
The pirate anchored on a Wednesday
And why he came to port, I wonder
To see a lady, so my friends say
She dances for the sailors in a smoky cabaret bar underground
Down in a cellar in a harbour town

[Verse 2]
I know he told her love was treasure
And they would reap the fullest bounty
He only comes to port for pleasure
So when the winds of morning blew the curtains in she woke and found he'd gone
I saw his sails unfurling Thursday dawn

[Chorus 1]
The pirate he will sink you with a kiss, he'll steal your heart and sail away
Saturday early we met in the cove near the forest
He'll leave you drowning in the flotsam of a broken promise in the bay
Dancing we wakened the dawn and the birds into chorus
He came again to see her, yes, I think they told me it was Saturday
Ask Penance Crane, she was out in her garden, she saw us
I was at sea then, I didn't see them

[Verse 3]
I don't believe what you are saying
It isn't true, I hardly knew him
Is this some game that you are playing?
Go ask the dancer, she's the one who saw him last, the one who drew him here
He hasn't come to me since spring last year

[Chorus 2]
There was a time when he would bring me silks and sandalwood and Persian lace
Then came another "goodbye" and another "Please don't go"
And he would hold me close and tell me sailing stories by the fireplace
All night I dance and all day I keep watch with my sorrow
I was at sea, I tell you, I was nowhere near the mentioned murder place
Searching for sails that don't come and I guess but I don't know

[Outro]
Go ask the dancer
She knows the answer
I don't know
She knows the answer
I don't know
She knows the answer
I don't know

I wear these Seven jeans, but baby they don't wear me
I keep it covered up, uh, 'cause I'm a lady
I know how to show a little somethin', somethin'
You can't see what's under there 'cause I'm a grown woman
I'm so sexy, remain a mystery
'Cause everybody always want what they can't see
And what they can't have, and what they can't grab
And what they can't buy, and baby that's me

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep callin' me, callin' me

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Luda!
I ain't lyin', I think I'm in love with a grown woman
She stay stuntin', got sweet lovin and home-cooking
Been known to make her moan 'til the break of dawn
A little lady in the street
But at home I give her a grown whoopin', yeah
I hit the jeweler and make a chain
Flawless white diamonds and I put that e'rythang
Mami stylin', she knows how to accessorize
And we some stairmasters, I make her get her exercise
Wit yo sexy thighs, body got me mesmerized
Little boys is scurred and other guys be petrified
But I can handle it, scramble it and dismantle it
Manage to get managed before I late night candle it
Blow em out, show em out, and show em how it's done
And ain't no need to venture out, she's my only one
Yep I love my grown woman and she love me back
Made me a grown ass man, now what you think of that?

It's the same old tears on a new background
Seeing you as a fading photograph
It hurts too much to laugh these days
I'm all right, yes, I'm all right, all right
It's the same old song with a new melody
But this old candle's lingering flame is almost gone
To see you again is all that keeps me hangin' on
I'm all right, yes, I'm all right, all right
Remembering, remembering the familiar heartache
No one but you
It's the same old me crying the same old tears
And I walk away like I always do
Still in love with you
But I'm all right, yes, I'm all right, all right
All right

I done had about four, five, six shots, yeah, I'm gettin' wasted
Red pills, blue pills, yeah, I'm in the Matrix
Two swisha, three swisha, four swisha, five
So turn my music up and tell these hoes to get live
Got a pocket full of hundreds and some bottles on ice, ice
Conjure and lime got a nigga feelin' nice, nice
Dessert on my hips so if you gamble, roll the dice
When I let it off once it make a nigga think twice
You got more dough then, homie, you gon' have to show me
You never say it rains like Tony, Tony, Tony
My Chevy's outside and it's sittin' on Kobe's
And I keep the hood with me like Obi Wan Kenobe
Wood grain trim, seat softer than your butt, butt
Make your car rattle from the speakers in my trunk, trunk
Swisha's burnin' slow and it got a nigga stuck, stuck
But don't be a fool cause the tool's on tuck, tuck

Tell that slow bitch to bring another round, we gon' party till the sun's up
Ladies rub your titties and my gangsta's put your guns up
Money, money, money, if you got it, throw your one's up
And if they ain't got it, tell 'em shut up, you dumb fuck
My money stays in hand, you could say I got a grip, grip
Out to scoop my chips, you could say I got a dip, dip
Cause I talk money while these haters talk shit, shit
And if they keep on talkin', I'mma empty out a clip, clip
But I don't want no problems, I'm just tryin' to get my game on
Take a couple shots and use the alcohol to blame on
Holla at some chicks and find a bitch to put my name on
Then I'mma be the, I'ma be the one she put that thang on
I got the perfect song to make you want me wanna shake, shake
And take her to the crib, I don't take her on no date, date
We all up in the club till the glass and table break, break
And all they wanna know is how much more that I can take, take

[Chorus]
P-p-party, I'mma party till I just can't party no mo
(Party, I'mma party till I just can't party no mo)
Party, I'mma party till I just can't party no mo
(Party, I'mma party till I just can't party no mo)
Let's take a shot
(Take a shot)
Take a shot
(Take a shot)
Party, I'mma party till I just can't party no mo
(Party, I'mma party till I just can't party no mo)

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Now keep the cameras flashin', we about to shoot a movie
A thick chick let me sip my glass on her booty
She stuck upon my hip and she swear she ain't no groupie
While I'm stuck up in the VIP but everything is all Gucci
So I gathered all the women and we 'bout to take a shot, shot
Goin' out my mind, who's there, nigga, knock, knock
Don't you hear that 808 beatin' down your block, block
Keep the party going cause the party don't stop, stop

[Chorus]
P-p-party, I'mma party till I just can't party no mo
(Party, I'mma party till I just can't party no mo)
Party, I'mma party till I just can't party no mo
(Party, I'mma party till I just can't party no mo)
Let's take a shot
(Take a shot)
Take a shot
(Take a shot)
Let's take a shot
(Take a shot)
Take a shot
(Take a shot)
Party, I'mma party till I just can't party no mo
(Party, I'mma party till I just can't party no mo)

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Where should I start? Disjointed heart
I've got no commitment to my own flesh and blood
Left all alone, far from my home
No one to hear me, to heal my ill heart

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I keep it locked up, inside

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I cannot express to the point I've regressed
If anger's a gift, then I guess I've been blessed

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I keep it locked up, inside
Keep my distance from your lies

[Interlude: Chester Bennington]
It's too late to love me, now
You have never shown me
It's too late to love me, now
You don't even know me

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Breaking a part of my heart to find release
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
Breaking a part of my heart to find release
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
Breaking a part of my heart to find release (Break!)
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace (Me!)
Breaking a part of my heart to find release (Down!)
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Keep it locked up, inside
Keep my distance from your lies

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
Breaking a part of my heart to find release (Break!)
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace (Me!)
Breaking a part of my heart to find release (Down!)
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
Breaking a part of my heart to find release
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
Breaking a part of my heart to find release
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
Keep my distance
Keep my distance
Keep my distance
Keep my distance

[Outro: Mike Shinoda]
Spit drips from the jaw of the witless witness
Cryptic colloquialisms shift your mid rift
Dog paddle through a bog of shadows and smog
With my thought catalog, analogue rap battle log
Keep my distance and fear resistance
Hurt by persistence, the twisted web of tangled lies
Strangles my hope to waste and numbs the taste
And I'm forced to face these hate crimes
Against the state of being
Feeling the weightlessness press me to the ceiling
Reeling around rooms, riding a bubble of sound
Tuned to the frequency making your chest shake
With every boom
Involuntary muscle contraction
Ignoring your neck's breaking, musical gas fume euphoria
The sound pounds to make the dead flush
To hand you a head rush with read rhymes and said stuff
When I think of Tom
I think of a night
When the earth smelled of summer
And the sky was streaked with white
The soft mist of England
Was sleeping on a hill

I remember this
And I always will
There are new lovers now
On the same silent hill
Looking on the same blue sea
And I know Tom and I are a part of them all
And they're all a part of Tom an me

Hello young lovers, whoever you are
I hope your troubles are few
All my good wishes go with you tonight
I've been in love like you

Be brave, young lovers, and follow your star
Be brave and faithful and true
Cling very close to each other tonight
I've been in love like you
I know how it feels to have wings on your heels
And to fly down the street in a trance
You fly down a street on the chance that you meet

And you meet, not really by chance

Don't cry young lovers, whatever you do
Don't cry because I'm alone;
All of my memories are happy tonight
I've had a love of my own
I've had a love of my own, like yours
I've had a love of my own

Be brave, young lovers, and follow your star
Be brave and faithful and true
Cling very close to each other tonight
I've been in love like you

I know how it feels to have wings on your heels
And to fly down the street in a trance
You fly down a street on the chance that you meet
And you meet, not really by chance

Don't cry young lovers, whatever you do
Don't cry because I'm alone;
All of my memories are happy tonight
I've had a love of my own
I've had a love of my own, like yours
I've had a love of my own

Who could ever doubt my love?
Who could ever doubt my love?

Ooh, I've been falsely accused
Of being untrue to him
And it's not so
But it's the way she misjudged me
That really hurts, hurts me so
When I've been nothing but good to you
Forsaking all others
Giving my love to you
Who could ever doubt my love?

A victim of circumstance I have been
But what really hurts is
Instead of believing me
She believed her friends
When I've been nothing but good to you

Rearrange my life to please only you
Who could ever doubt my love?
Who could ever doubt my love?
Ooh, I've been cast aside
Because she believed someone elses lies
After I've done the best I could
Still I've been so misunderstood
After I've been good to you
So good, so good to you

Who could ever doubt my love?
Tell me
Who could ever doubt my love?
I wanna know
Who could ever doubt my love?
Please tell me
Who could
When you are lovin' somebody's lover
Then you gotta understand
Take a chance and love her
Love her when you can
That's how it is, I know the price
'Coz I'm payin' the bill

Oh, lovin? somebody's girl
Keeps you mighty, mighty uptight
Seems the one that you love
Go somewhere else at night
That's how it is, I know the price
'Coz I'm payin' the bill

To make it some one lover
You gotta be mighty weak or strong
Knowin' in the midnight hour
When you're all alone
Now the one you're loving
Is takin' care of business at home
Oh, lovin' somebody's lover
You have to take what you can
I swear it makes you feel sometimes
Like a handout from the welfare man
That's how it is, I know the price
'Coz I'm payin' the bill
It started all over again
The moment I looked in your eyes
It started all over again
The thrill we can never disguise

The day that we parted, so broken-hearted
Will never return again
Dreams I've delayed, promises made
Are starting anew, just for you

It started all over again
The moment I held you so tight
It started all over again
When we kissed away the night, till dawn's early light

Now were together, sweethearts forever
We'll build our romance anew
It started all over again
The moment I looked at you

It started all over again
The moment I held you so tight
It started all over again
When we kissed away the night, till dawn's early light
Now were together, sweethearts forever
We'll build our romance anew
It started all over again
The moment I looked at you
Swing low, sweet chariot
Coming for to carry me home
Swing low

He used to be the one that bring you pleasure
He used to be the one that pulled you through
Now his moods are changing like the weather
(used to be the one, used to be the one)
He's taking his frustration out on you
(used to be the one, used to be the one)

Leave him alone, let him go!
Baby it's your right, take back your life
Don't wait, for some other day
Tomorrow might be too late
Only you can stop the pain

He used to be the one that made you happy
(used to be the one, used to be the one)
He used to be the one to plead for you
(used to be the one) baby (used to be the one)
Now he's just a beast that keeps you crying
(used to be the one, used to be the one)
A demon from your worst nightmare come true
Leave him alone, let him go!
Baby it's your right, take back your life
Don't wait, for some other day
Tomorrow might be too late
Only you can stop the pain

Let him go

Those days are over now!
That he used to be the one
(used to be the one, used to be the one)
Those days are over now!
(used to be the one, used to be the one)
That he used to be the one......
Everybody’s raised in blindness
Everbody knows it’s true
Everybody feels that everything is real
Anbody’s point of view

Nobody can break their bondage
Everyone can feel their chains
But even in my life I knew you found your sight
And nothing would be quite the same
Please help me

Who can I be now?
You found me, Oooo
Can I be held apart?
You found me, now can I be?
Now you found me, Now can I be real?
Can I be real?

If it’s all a vast creation
Putting on a face that’s new
Someone has to see
A role for him and me
Someone might as well be you
Up in heaven, any angel
Writes a special game to play
Oh, could we, could we make a start
To snatch their Angels part?
A major role for everyday
Please help me

Who can I be now?
You found me, Ooo
Can I be held apart?
You found me, now can I be?

Now, I've been accused of going Hollywood
Chasing some cinematic schemes
But I'll give you Panavision pictures
'Cos you give me Technicolor dreams

Up there, walking on air
I'd like to show you how
I loved you way back then
As much as I need you now

Some people like to send the world away
Some sunlight on some silver beams
And I'll give you Panavision pictures
'Cos you give me Technicolor dreams

Oh wow, look at us now
All of our dreams fulfill
I would implore you still
From under your windowsill

Sometimes, I'd like to send the world away
Some sunlight on some silver beams
So I'll give you Panavision pictures
'Cos you give me Technicolor dreams
Technicolor dreams
I'll give you Panavision pictures
Cause you give me Technicolor dreams

Go far, follow your star
I'll help you climb that hill
I would adore you still
From under your windowstill

Sometimes I'd like to send the world away
Some sunlight under some silver beams
So I'll give you Panavision pictures
Cause you give me Technicolor dreams
Technicolor dreams
Today is the first day of the rest of my life
I wake as a child to see the world begin
On monarch wings, and birthday wonderings
Want to put on faces walk in the wet and cold

And look forward to my growing old
To grow is to change, to change is to be new
To be new is to be young again
I barely remember when

My memories are stolen by the morning
Blotted out by the sun's hypnotic light
Out by the sun's hypnotic light

Today is the first day of the rest of my life
I wake as a child to see the world begin
On monarch wings, and birthday wonderings
Want to put on faces walk in the wet and cold

And look forward to my growing old
Keep bustin'
Let's do it, do it
Let's do it, do it, do-do-do it

The First Noel
The angels did say
Was to certain
Poor shepherds
In fields as they lay
In fields where they may
Keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night
That was so deep
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born
Is the King of Israel

They looked up
And saw a star
Shining in the East
Beyond them far
And to the Earth
It gave great light
And so it continued
Both day and night
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born
Is the King of Israel
Then entered
In those Wise men three
Full reverently
Upon their knee
And offered there
In His presence
Their gold and myrrh
And frankincense
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born
Is the King of Israel
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born
Is the King of Israel

[Verse 1]
Here lies the powder and perfume
The pretty clothes are scattered 'round the room
And it's so like Candy
Here lies the lipstick and the face
The colored tablets keep it all in place
And it's so like Candy
So like Candy

[Chorus]
What did I do to make her go?
Why must she be the one that I have to love
So like Candy?

[Verse 2]
Here lies a picture of a girl
Her arms are tight around that lucky guy
And it's so like Candy
And in her eyes a certain look
I thought I'd seen the last of long ago
And it's so like Candy
So like Candy

[Chorus]
What did I do to make her go?
Why must she be the one that I have to love
So like Candy?

[Verse 3]
I remember the day that picture was taken
We were so happy then, but that's so like Candy
She seemed so sweet to me I was mistaken
Oh no, not that again, but that's so like Candy
She just can't face the day
So she turns and melts away

Here lie the records that she scratched
And on the sleeve I find a note attached
And it's so like Candy
"My Darling Dear it's such a waste"
She couldn't say "goodbye", but "I admire your taste"
And it's so like Candy
So like Candy
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord
I believe I'm fixing to die
Well, I don't mind dying
But I hate to leave my children crying
Well, I look over yonder to that burying ground
Look over yonder to that burying ground
Sure seems lonesome, Lord
When the sun goes down
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord
I believe I'm fixing to die
Well, I don't mind dying but
I hate to leave my children crying
There's a black smoke rising, Lord
It's rising up above my head, up above my head
It's rising up above my head, up above my head
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed
I'm walking kind of funny, Lord
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die
Yes I'm walking kind of funny, Lord
I believe I'm fixing to die
Fixing to die, fixing to die
Well, I don't mind dying
But I hate to leave my children crying
9 - 9 - 9 - 9 - 9 lives

This is the 90's and I need a lover with (9 lives)
With my bad self
(If I really) {sample repeats in song}
I.. I.. I.. I...
(9 lives)
Sing Stella

CHORUS:
If I really had 9 lives
I'd want a lover that controlled my mind
Someone who knows about the heavenly sin
How 2 kill with love again, again and again

When she calls me on the phone
She'll ask if I'm alone
Standin' at my door lookin' mega-fine
Heck-a-pump body sayin' good time
When all the others talk plenty of jive
My lover talks about 9 lives
The first 2 promise I'll die from the heat
Generated from the moment that our eyes meet
CHORUS
(With my bad self)

Life number 3 and number 4
Are spent makin' love on the magic floor
It's got no walls so all can see
The way real love is supposed 2 be
Don't be ashamed, my lover said
Then she says "Mmm, I betcha I'm mega-jammin'"
Life number 5, 6 and 7
Need U ask, go like heaven

CHORUS
(With my bad self)
(Control me)

With my bad self

If I really had 9 lives
I'd want a lover that controlled my mind

2 kill with love, we'd never die
We'd never long 4, we'd never cry
If we live 4 havin' each other's touch
It's never 2 little, it's never 2 much
Play
With my bad self
With my, with my bad self

If I really had, if I really had, if I really had 9 lives

This is the 90's
And everybody wants a lover
A life-long lover with 9 lives

(9 lives)
This is the 90's

(CHORUS) {repeat in BG}
Sing Stella

Call me up on the phone
I'll be here all alone
I'll be waitin' on U, baby
I'll be waitin' on U and your 9 lives!

Silence

[Verse 1]
Running after recognition
Instant gratification
Silky cradle of illusion
Immediate satisfaction
(Pleasure, pleasure, why)
I want to build a castle
(Pleasure, pleasure, why)
It's too much of a hassle

[Chorus]
Desperate polemic
To feel more happy

[Verse 2]
It's a funny dictatorship
The one by which one must have
Pleasure, pleasure all of the time
In looking for this for real life
(Pleasure, pleasure, why)
Try to make it work in disguise
(Pleasure, pleasure, why)
Doesn't exist, I realize

[Verse 3]
His false and artificial means
(Pleasure, pleasure, why)
Isn't my reality
(Pleasure, pleasure, why)
Enforces a state of ennui

[Chorus]
Desperate polemic
To feel more happy

[Outro]
Their hole is bottomless
Our freedom is endless
You may lie among your
Eternal amusement
From moment to moment every moment that I live
I live for every moment with you
To see you, to touch you, to imagine this will be
The moment when a dream comes true

Just an ordinary day becomes adventure
Such sweet adventure I never knew
And life will be rainbows as I learn the secret of
The miracle that love can do
From moment to moment with you

[musical interlude]

And life will be rainbows as I learn the secret of
The miracle that love can do
From moment to moment with you
Was it for a moments pleasure
That brought me to your door
Was it for your darkest treasure
Could I have loved you more

Did I take the time to tell you
I'd seen you once before
You were standing in my garden
And I was on the floor

You came around that evening
You came around that fall
My heart went out that evening
Never came back at all, oh

And so I came to know you
As keeper of my heart
It saw me search and saw you
It showed me from the start

Time and again I've held you near me
I wonder if you've ever known
How I hold you near me
Is not exactly shown
I'm coming around to know you
I've come to find my place
And someone there to go to
It's come to be my fate

Like a fire holds its heat in
Like the winter holds its cold
Like a question holds its answer
That's the way you hold

I came around that evening
I came around that fall
My heart went out that evening
Never came back at all

Coming around to know you
I've come to find my place
I-I love the colorful clothes she wears
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
I hear the sound of a gentle word
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air

I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations)

Close my eyes, she's somehow closer now
Softly smile, I know she must be kind
When I look in her eyes
She goes with me to a blossom world

I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations)
(Ahh)
(Ah, my my, what elation)
I don't know where but she sends me there
(Oh, my my, what a sensation)
(Oh, my my, what elation)
(Oh, my my, what)

Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin'

(Ahh)

Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
(I'm pickin' up good vibrations) (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations

Na na na na na, na na na
Na na na na na, na na na (Bop bop-bop-bop-bop, bop)
Do do do do do, do do do (Bop bop-bop-bop-bop, bop)
Do do do do do, do do do (Bop bop-bop-bop-bop, bop)
There was Adam, happy as a man could be
Till Eve got him messin' with that old apple tree

Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
They'll do it every time

Lot took his wife down to the corner for a malted
She wouldn't mind her business, boy, did she get salted

Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
They'll do it every time
Samson thought Delilah was on the square
Till one night she clipped him all his hair

Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
They'll do it every time
From our history books we all learned
Nero fiddled while Rome was burned

Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
They'll do it every time

Marie Antoinette met some hungry cats at the gate
They was crying for bread, she said, "Let them eat cake"

Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
They'll do it every time

You can buy a woman clothes
And give her money on the side
No matter what you do
She ain't never satisfied
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
They'll do it every time

[Verse 1]
So they paved paradise and put up a parking lot
With a pink hotel. a boutique and a swinging night spot

[Chorus]
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot

[Verse 2]
They took all the trees, put 'em in a tree museum
And they charged all the people an arm and a leg just to see 'em

[Chorus]
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot

[Verse 3]
Hey farmer, put away your DDT
Give me spots on my apples
But leave me the birds and bees, please

[Chorus]
Don't it always seem to go
You don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot

[Verse 4]
Late last night, I heard the screen door slam
And a big yellow taxi come and took away my old man

[Chorus]
Oh, don't it always seem to go
You don't know what you got 'til it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
They put up a parking lot
Writer(s): Cahn/Styne

I can see a steeple - surrounded by people
Oh how real it all starts to seem
Just as the choir is singing - my alarm starts ringing
It's the same old dream

And then my thoughts inspire - a scene by a fire
In a cottage close by a stream
I know it all by heart now - we're about to part now
It's the same old dream

If you but knew
How many times I pretend - that I'm with you
I'm sure your heart would unbend - you'd see me through
Until my dream had a happy ending

And I can picture clearly - the things I love dearly
In the center you reign supreme
We kiss and I discover - I'm a lonesome lover
It's the same old dream

[Verse 1]
All the small boats on the water
Aren't going anywhere
Surely, they must be loaded with
More than simple matter
Floating on top and gracefully
Tending to the same pole
All the small boats on the water
Going nowhere

[Hook 1]
Is it true that none of them
Will ever break free and sail?
Feel the night is made of rocks
The stagnant mass
Is it true that none of them
Will ever break free and sail?
Break free from the stagnant boats
Left in obscurity, left in obscurity

[Verse 2]
All the faces with their eyes closed
Giving a smile, weightless
Like a body that would vacate
To its own light

[Hook 2]
Is it true that none of these
Contented, happy faces
Will not ever hear a cry?
Won't hear a cry?
Is it true that none of these
Contented, happy faces
Will not ever hear a cry?
Filled with love, not with desire
Love, not desire

[Verse 1]
All the small boats on the water
Aren't going anywhere
Surely, they must be loaded with
More than simple matter
Floating on top and gracefully
Tending to the same pole
All the small boats on the water
Going nowhere

[Hook 1]
Is it true that none of them
Will ever break free and sail?
Feel the night is made of rocks
The stagnant mass
Is it true that none of them
Will ever break free and sail?
Break free from the stagnant boats
Left in obscurity, left in obscurity
Why do I do just as you say?
Why must I just give you your way?
Why do I sigh?
Why don't I try to forget?

It must have been that something lovers call fate
Kept me saying, "I had to wait"
I saw them all
Just couldn't fall 'til we met

It had to be you
It had to be you
I wandered around and I finally found
The somebody who could make me be true
And could make me be blue
And even be glad just to be sad thinking of you

Some others I've seen
Might never been mean
Might never be crossed or try to be bossed
But they wouldn't do
For nobody else gave me a thrill
With all your faults, I love you still
It had to be you, wonderful you
It had to be you

For nobody else gave me a thrill
With all your faults, I love you still
It had to be you, wonderful you
It had to be you
There was a boy...
A very strange enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far, very far
Over land and sea
A little shy and sad of eye
But very wise was he

And then one day
A magic day, he passed my way
And while we spoke of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me
The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return

There was a boy...
A very strange enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far, very far
Over land and sea
A little shy and sad of eye
But very wise was he
And then one day
A magic day, he passed my way
And while we spoke of many things
Fools and kings
This he said to me
"The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return."
To me you're extra special mellow
And the thrill I feel is real and oh so good
So when you say you love me, I really believe you, girl
For it's what you say and what you really do

Oh, you've got to understand, darling
The world is not for long, baby
There's only time for singing and praying
And having a love party

You've got to check out the times, baby
'Cause what we need is a love explosion
We don't have no time to waste
Got to pray, whoo

Baby, your life and mine is grooving on the danger
Revelations prophecy's nearly fulfilled
We are blessed to experience a changing world
So let's love before our fate is closed and sealed

You've got to understand, baby
(We don't have the time to waste)
The world is not for long
(Got to pray and meditate)
There's only time for singing and praying
(We don't have the time to waste)
And having a love party
(Got to pray and meditate)

Go check out the times, baby
(We don't have the time to waste)
What we need is a love explosion
(Got to pray and meditate)

We don't have no time to waste
(We don't have the time to waste)
Got to pray and meditate
(Got to pray and meditate)

On the birdies and the bees
And the flowers and the trees
And the fishes in the rivers
And on all the things He give us

On your body in His image
And your power with no limits
On your heart and your soul
And your purpose and your goals

On your reasons and your rhymes
And your seasons and your times
On your family and your Bible
And your knowledge of survival
Meditation deep within
That's the way it begins
Baby, it begins
Baby, it begins
(Oh yeah)

To me you're really extra special mellow, baby
Oh, and the thrill I feel is real and oh so good, baby
So when you say you love me, I believe you, baby
And it's good to party, fun to party with you, baby

To me you're extra special mellow, baby
And the thrill I feel is real and oh so good, baby
Mmm, so when the party's over
Let's go create some loving, baby

Whoa, no time, baby
(Got to pray and meditate)
Fooling around, let there be peace and love
(Got to pray and meditate)

Oh baby, come here, come here, come here, darling
Oh, we need love
(Got to pray and meditate)
Love explosion, oh darling
Mmm, come here, come here, come here, baby
(Got to pray and meditate)
Ol' MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O
And on this farm there was a chick
The purtiest chick I know
With a little curve here and a little curve there
This chick, she had curves everywhere
Ol' MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O

And oh, this chick, she had a walk, E-I-E-I-O
And how this walk would drive 'em wild swingin' to and 'fro
With a little wiggle here and a little wiggle there
Man, this chick had wiggles to spare
Ol' MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O

When she went walkin' into town, E-I-E-I-O
The local gentry popped their eyes
Tarnation, what a show
With a "goldang" here and a "goshdarn" there
"Heavens to Betsy" I do declare
Ol' MacDonald had a farm E-I-E-I-O

There was a barn dance Saturday night, E-I-E-I-O
And the fellas came from miles around
Just to see her do-si-do
With a promenade here and a promenade there
At a square dance, boy, this chick was no square
Ol' MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O
I used to be a travelling man, E-I-O
Until I hit MacDonald's place things were mighty slow
With a little chick here and a little chick there
I didn't have a real chick anywhere
Ol' MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O

This farmer's daughter knocked me out, E-I-E-I-O, ah-hah
I asked MacDonald for her hand
And Pappy hollered "Go!"
With a little curve here and a little wiggle there
A "goldang" here and a "goshdarn" there
A do-si-do here and a promenade there
Got my own private county fair
'cause ol' MacDonald had a farm, E-I-O-I-O!!
Dear Mrs.Roosevelt, don't hang your head and cry
His mortal flesh is laid away but his good work fills the sky
This world was lucky to see him born

Now he went up to grade school and he wrote back to his folks
He drew such funny pictures and was always pulling jokes
This world was lucky to see him born

He went up to Harvard to read his books of law
He loved his trees and horses, he loved everything he saw
This world was lucky to see him born

He got struck down by the fever and it settled in his leg
He loved the folks that wished him well and everybody did
This world was lucky to see him born

He took office on a crippled leg and he said to one and all
"Your money changing racket, boys, sure enough got to fall."
This world was lucky to see him born

I voted for him lots of times and I'd vote for him again
He tried to find an honest job for every idle man
This world was lucky to see him born
He helped me to build my union and he learned me how to talk
I could see he was a cripple but he learned my soul to talk
This world was lucky to see him born

I was a GI in the army the day he passed away
And over my shoulder I could hear some soldier say
"This world was lucky to see him born."

I know this world was lucky just to see him born
I know this world was lucky just to see him born
This world was lucky to see him born
Got a fine lookin' woman, lives way across the town
Yes, she's a fine lookin' woman, lives way across the town
Whenever I see that woman
My love comes tumbling down

She's a fine lookin' woman and she soothes my worried soul
She's a fine lookin' woman and she soothes my worried soul
Well, she put the lights out on me
Then I gave up all my gold

She's a fine lookin' woman and she shakes all the men
Yeah, fine lookin' woman and the meat shakes on the bone
Well, everytime she shakes mine
Then all my body's gone

[Intro: Ice-T]
Yo, check this out
Getting wreck for 1993

Yo Grip, tell' em what time it is

[Verse 1]
Yo, i'm the funky funky Gripsta and i'mma tell you how it is

As a young-ass kid i was always trippin'

[?]
Always different from the rest 'cause 

[?]

[?]

[?] I'll tell you what's up
Yes i'm a female and i cannot be stopped
You try to disrespect me and your ass will get dropped

[?] to the concrete floor
Any nigga got beef, you can see the door
'Cause i'm a sister who ain't taking no crap

[?]
Like a gangsta, i'm always on the run
And anybody got beef with this, come and get some

[Chorus: x4]
Gotta get a grip, gotta get a grip, gotta get a grip, gotta get a grip
Go on, girl!

Yo Grip, i still think they think we're bullshittin'
Yo Aladdin, throw on some of that old gangsta shit
Yo Grip, wreck these motherfuckers for me, baby, come on, do this!

[?] my rhymes will make you trip
And when it's all over, you'll be shouting "Grip!"

[Outro: Ice-T]
Yeah, in your face 1993, Grip's in the motherfucking house, fool
All female MCs beware
Wait for the LP comin' out this year
Grip's in here
The stage is set another show must go on
The spotlight's burning down into my face
The drummer sits up high upon his rostrum
Guitarists play each other face to face
And when it's over , I'll stop and wonder
And never understand
'cause leaving this was never in my plans
And when I'm playing all I see is things you'll never find
Flowing rivers passing through my mind

Deceiving and receiving was my pastime
To every girl who liked my written lines
They'd think that any moment I'd be their guy
But crying never justified my lies , oh no
And next time 'round will be the same
They never understand that hurting them was never in my plans
My songs will slow like passing clouds
Something in each line
Flowing rivers passing through my mind

I've got to go , I've finished what I came for
Playing every city , state to state
Singing every town that learned to like me
Modest payments paid for what I ate
Ah, you're standing there , tears in your eyes
You once called me a man
And loving you was never in my plans
We'll go together , you and I , till we both find
Flowing rivers passing through my mind
We'll go together, you and I , till we both find
Flowing rivers passing through my mind
A fellow needs a girl to sit by his side, at the end of a weary day
To sit by his side and listen to him talk and agree with the things he'll say
A fellow needs a girl to hold in hid arms when the rest of the world goes wrong
To hold in his arms and know that she believes that her fellow is wise and strong

When things go right, and his job's well done
He wants to share the prize he's won
If no one shares and no one cares
Where is the fun of a job well done? Or a prize you've won?

A fellow needs a home, his own kind of home, but to make this dream come true
A fellow needs a girl, his own kind of girl, my kind of girl is you

Oh, they say some people long ago
Were searching for a different tune
One that they could croon
As only they can

They only had the rhythm, so
They started swaying to and fro
They didn't know just what to use
This is how the blues really began

They heard the breeze in the trees
Singing weird melodies
And they made that the start of the blues

And from a jail came the wail
Of a down-hearted frail
And they played that
As a part of the blues
From a whippoorwill way up on a hill
They took a new note
Pushed it through a horn until it was worn
Into a blue note

And then they nursed it, they rehearsed it
And then sent out that news
That the southland gave birth to the blues
They nursed it, then they rehearsed it
And then sent out that news
The southland, they gave birth to the blues
Today is gonna be the day
That you're gonna ... back to you
By now you should've realized... what you gotta do

I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now

And all the roads that lead to you are winding
And all the ... tou you are blinding
There are many wayss that I would like to sing to you
But I don't know how

I said maybe...
Who knows how much I love you
You do

No one means more to me than
You do
You take December and smile it into May
And then December comes back again
When you're away

Who has a charm that very few do
Who makes life necessary

You do
And who can take my dreams
And make my dreams come true

Who don't give me three guesses
One will do
You made me leave my happy hoe
You took my love and now you're gone
Since I fell for you

Love brings such misery and pain
I guess I'll never be the same
Since I fell for you

Oh, it's too bad, oh, it's so sad
I'm in love with you
You love me, then you snub me
But what can I do
I'm so in love with you

Oh, I guess I'll never see the light
I get the blues 'bout every night
Since I fell for you

Well, it's too bad, oh, it's so sad
That I'm in love with you
Oh, you love me, then you snub me
Oh, but what can I do
I'm so in love with you
Oh, I guess I'll never see the light
I get the blues 'bout every night
Since I fell for you
Since I fell for you
What did he do that I didn't do?
What did he say - I didn't say?
What has he got that I haven't got?
Why don't you tell me baby?
Why don't you tell me baby?

What did he buy that I didn't buy?
What did he try that I didn't try?
What else he got that I haven't got?
He's got you baby
He's got you baby

What did he do - I didn't do?
What did he say - I didn't say?
What has he got - I haven't got?
He's got you baby
He's got you baby

What did he buy - I didn't buy?
What did he try that I didn't try?
What has he got that I haven't got?
He's got you baby
He's got you baby
Honey honey he's got you baby
He's got your love baby
He's got your love
Oh yes he has

[Verse]
Strangers in the night exchanging glances
Wondering in the night what were the chances
We'd be sharing love before the night was through

[Pre-Chorus]
Something in your eyes was so inviting
Something in your smile was so exciting
Something in my heart told me I must have you

[Chorus]
Strangers in the night
Two lonely people, we were strangers in the night
Up to the moment when we said our first hello, little did we know
Love was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away

[Post-Chorus]
Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight, in love forever
It turned out so right for strangers in the night

[Bridge]
Ah, ah, yeah, yeah, mmm

[scatting]

[Chorus]
Strangers in the night
Two lonely people, we were strangers in the night
Up to the moment when we said our first hello, little did we know
Love was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away

[Post-Chorus]
Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight, in love forever
It turned out so right for strangers in the night
Ah, it turned out so right for strangers in, in the night

[Outro]
We were strangers, couple of strangers
Two lonely people, ah, but we were lovers
Groovy lovers, couple of strangers
Ah, loving strangers, yeah
Play you a song

What do you get for trying?
Minute you're born, you're dying
Body is six feet down
The Lord said the soul sticks around

You can believe what you wanna
But I know what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna believe in the Lord
You can believe what you wanna
But I know what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna believe in the Lord

You think you live on laughter
But you don't know what's after
Singing hallelujah
I can know the master

You can believe what you wanna
But I know what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna believe in the Lord
You can believe what you wanna
But I know what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna believe in the Lord, yeah
When my life is over
Lie in fields of clover
Waiting for my own girl
Living in a new world, yeah

Well, you can believe what you wanna
But I know what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna believe in the Lord
You can believe what you wanna
But I know what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna believe in the Lord

What do you get for trying?
Minute you're born, you're dying
The body is six feet down
The Lord said the soul sticks around

Well, you can believe what you wanna
But I know what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna believe in the Lord
You can believe what you wanna
But I know what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna believe in the Lord

You can believe what you wanna
But I know what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna believe in the Lord
I'm gonna believe in the Lord
Shipmates and Cheyenne, raindrops and cryin'
Haunt the dreams of an old, old man
Candles and church bells, laughter and farewells
Revolve in his thoughts like a wind

Stallions and blizzards, steelies and lizards
Adrift in the meadows of time
No sense of progression, of age or direction
No meter, no form, no rhyme

I'll hold me one
Just one rising sun
Long after daylight is gone
I'll hold me one
One more rising sun
Till my daylight and darkness is done

Kingdoms and cupboards, losers and lovers
And ev'nings of blackberry wine
Falling like sand, the mem'ry of hands
And kisses, and whispers and sighs
I'll hold me one
Just one rising sun
Till long after daylight is gone
I'll hold me one
One more rising sun
Till my daylight and darkness is done

I'll hold me one
One rising sun
One more rising sun
Till my daylight and darkness is done
Roll up, roll up for the magical mystery tour!
Step right this way!

Roll up
Roll up for the mystery tour
Roll up
Roll up for the mystery tour

The magical mystery tour is waiting to take you away
Waiting to take you away, take you today

There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy

All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need
Everywhere people stare
Each and ev'ry day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

Hey, you've got to hide your love away!
Hey, you've got to hide your love away!

Oho, I never realised what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see?
Can't you see?

That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me to, ohohoho, oho
And when I ask you to be mine, ahaha
You're gonna say you love me too

It's been a hard days night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard days night
I should be sleeping like a log

But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
Oh!

I think I'm gonna be sad
I think it's today, yeah!
The girl that's driving me mad
Is going away

She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
And she don't care

Jo-Jo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last
Jo-Jo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass

Get back!
Get back!

[Verse 1]
I was a stranger in the city
Out of town were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do? What to do? What to do?
The outlook was decidedly blue
But as I walked through the foggy streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known

[Verse 2]
A foggy day in London Town
Had me low and had me down
I viewed the morning with alarm
The British Museum had lost its charm
How long, I wondered, could this thing last?
But the age of miracles hadn't passed
For, suddenly, I saw you there
And through foggy London Town
The sun was shining everywhere
Everyone has gone away, can you hear me? Can you hear me?
No one cared enough to stay, can you hear me?
You must remember me, old man, I know that you can if you try
So just open up your eyes, old man, look who's come to say, "Goodbye."

The sun has left the sky, old man, the birds have flown away
And no one came to cry old man, goodbye, old man, goodbye
You want to stay, I know you do, but it ain't no use to try

Cause I'll be here, and I'm just like you, goodbye, old man, goodbye

Won't be no God to comfort you, you taught me not to believe that lie
You don't need anybody, nobody needs you, don't cry, old man, don't cry. Everybody dies
Woman, I have to leave you
I can't stay where there is no pay
And I really don't care where I'm going to
Its been so long since I've been gone
Lord, I'm tired and I want to go home
My throat is raw from singing the blues
Need all my friends to talk to
Now yes I do need all my friends to talk to

Gonna search around til I find a friend
Who believes in me for what I am
Sing my song til it hurts
Play my music til I hit pay dirt
Now I got to sing my song
I got to play my music, do the things I love

Its been so long since I've been gone
Lord, I'm tired and I want to go home
My throat is raw from singing the blues
Need all my friends to talk to
Now yes I do need all my friends to talk to
There's a lot of strange men in cell block ten
But the strangest of em' all
Was a friend of mine who spent his time
Starin' at the wall, starin' at the wall
As he looked at the wall so strong and tall
You heard him softly curse
Nobody at all ever climbed that wall
But I'm gonna be the first, I'm gonna be the first
Well the warden walked by and said, "Son don't try
I'd hate to see you fall
For there is no doubt they'll carry you out
If you ever touch that wall, if you ever touch that wall"
Well a years went by since he
Well a years gone
Well a years gone by since he made his try
But I can still recall
How hard he tried and the way he died
But he never made that wall, he never made that wall
Well there's never been a man who shook this camp
But I knew a man who tried
The newspapers called it a jailbreak plan
But I know it was suicide, I know it was suicide
Sunbeams are gently fading, slowly fading
And birds are waiting to do their mating
When eventide is nigh, moonbeams are descending
The day is ending, a happy ending
The sun is sinking below the western sky

[Chorus]
Every little breeze is sighing of love at sundown
Every little bird is resting and feather nesting at sundown
Each little rosebud is sleeping, while shadows are creeping
In a little cottage cozy the world seems rosy at sundown

Where a loving smile will greet me and always meet me at sundown
I seem to sigh, I'm in heaven
When night is falling and love is calling me home
Daydreams through fields of clover, will soon be over

And happy hours 'mid sunny flowers will wait another day
Sweet dreams have just begun, dear, the day is done, dear
When skies grow dimmer
And stars will glimmer along the starlit way

[Chorus]
Where a loving smile will greet me and always meet me at sundown
I seem to sigh, I'm in heaven
When night is falling and love is calling me home

[Intro:]
This is just to show my appreciation
For all of your love
For all of these years

[Chorus]
Your doin' the most (yeah, yeah)
I wanna learn (oh yeah, yeah)
To understand (oh baby, baby yeah)
And I like it babe (and I like babe)
Listen

[Verse 1:]
You're there for me everytime
You make sure that I'm alright
Down for me with so much love
No matter what
I can't believe you deal with me
Even when I put you down
How can you keep giving?
When I disappoint you
You don't deserve it
But why do you take it?
'Cause you say I'm worth it

[Chorus:]
You're doing the most (show me baby)
I wanna learn (teach me suga)
To understand
How to love and please you (yeah)
Like you do every time I need you (oh, oh yeah)
You're doing the most (you're doin' the most)
I wanna learn (I wanna learn)
To understand
I sampled a taste of your forever
And I like it babe (and I like it babe)

[Verse 2:]
It been a minute since we spent some time
I was in the wrong state of mind
Hope I can fix it
With dinner by candlelight
A dozen roses
Hershey kisses for the ground you walk on
If I never told you
I'm so proud to say your mine
My time and attention
I'm willing to give it
I don't wanna lose you
I couldn't take it

[Chorus:]
Yeah, you're doin' the most (your doin' the most)
I wanna learn (teach me suga)
To understand
How to love and please you (yeah)
Like you do every time I need ya (oh, oh baby)
You're doing the most (doin' the most, yeah)
I wanna learn (I wanna learn)
To understand
Say I sampled a taste of your forever
And I like it babe (Ooo girl I like it)
I like it babe

[Bridge]
I used to have my dimes
Love was just a game to me
But now I know why love's so amazing
Because it changed me

You never gave up
And now I know
True love's not taken
Thank God you're who you are

'Cause you gave love
From your heart

[Chorus]
You're doing the most (your doin' the most)
I wanna learn (I wanna learn yeah)
To understand
Like you do everytime I need you
You're doing the most (show me baby)
I wanna learn (I wanna learn)
To understand
Sampled a taste of your forever
And I like it babe (Ooo girl I like it babe)
I like it babe
All the times we fussed and fight
Wanna make you feel good tonight
This is your day suga
Smile for me babe

[Chorus]
You're doing the most (uh oh, your doing the most)
I wanna learn (girl I really want to understand)
To understand
Sampled a taste of your forever
And I like it babe (Ooh girl I like it)
I like it babe
You taste so good to me
When no one cares
And the phone never rings
The nights are endless things
You're like a child that cries
And no one hears the crying
You're like a falling star that dies
And seems to go on dying
When no one cares
You just count so many years
And they glisten
With each tear
You can't believe that a love like hers
Could come from someone new
When no one cares
But you
Just a melancholy echo ling'ring when the day is through
It's the call of the canyon, once again I'm dreaming of you
Every night I search the moonlight up and down the river shore
It's the call of the canyon, maybe I will find you once more
Standing there alone by the ashes of the fire we said would never die
Will I ever find an ember burning from the days gone by
Then I hear a lonely whisper as a little spark I see
It's the call of the canyon, bringing back your answer to me

[Verse 1]
Time is truly wasting
There's no guarantee, no, no
Smile is in the making
We got to fight the powers that be
We gotta fight
Got so many voices, saying all the same, yeah
Killing up all around me, faces full of pain

[Chorus]
I tried to play my music, they say my music's too loud
I tried talking about it, got the big runaround
And when I rolled with the punches I got knocked on the ground
With all this bullshit going down, hey

[Verse 2]
Time is truly wasting,  there's no guarantee, no
Smile is in the making, we got to fight the powers that be
I don't understand it, people wanna say yeah
Those that got the answers, red tape in the way
I could tend to it easy, let's just have some fun, no, no
Seeking my satisfaction, keeps me on the run

[Chorus]
I tried to play my music, say my music's too loud
I tried talking about it, I got the big runaround
And when I rolled with the punches I got knocked on the ground
With all this bullshit going down, oooh

[Outro]
Time is truly wasting, there's no guarantee, no
Smile is in the making, we got to fight the powers that be
Fight it baby, yeah, woo, hey, even you and I can fight the power
Fight it, fight the power
Stand up and
Come on and fight
Fight it
Oh yeah, yeah (1 2 3 4)

Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday

Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday

Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday
You can knock me down
Slap my face
Slander my name
All over the place
Do anything that you want to do
But oh oh honey
Lay of them blue suede shoes
Now don't you step
On my blue suede shoes
Well you can do anything
But lay of them blue suede shoes

You can burn my house
Steal my car

But ah ah honey

On my blue suede shoes, please
Well you can do anything
But lay of them blue suede shoes

Well we're going to, yeah we're going to
Get it right this time

Raise it to the sky

People are ready to forgive a few mistakes
But let's get started from a party
Don't you know how long it takes

C'mon people let the fun begin
We've got a future and it's rushing in
Call all the minstrels from the ancient shrine
Pass down the message that it's right this time

Well I'm trying to, yeah I'm crying to
Lay it on the line
We're trying to, really dying to
Get it right this time

So many yearing for the way it's gonna be
Believe it when you see it happening to you

We'll do what never has be done before

Punctured bicycle
On a hillside desolate
Will nature make a man of me yet ?

When in this charming car
This charming man

Why pamper life's complexities
When the leather runs smooth
On the passenger seat ?

I would go out tonight
But i haven't got a stitch to wear
This man said "it's gruesome
That someone so handsome should care"

Ah ! a jumped-up pantry boy
Who never knew his place
He said "return the ring"
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things
I would go out tonight
But i haven't got a stitch to wear
This man said "it's gruesome
That someone so handsome should care"
La, la-la, la-la, la-la, this charming man ...
Oh, la-la, la-la, la-la, this charming man ...

Ah ! a jumped-up pantry boy
Who never knew his place
He said "return the ring"
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things

[Intro: R. Kelly]
Your body's callin', distant lover I will be right here, so have no fear
Your body's callin', distant lover I will be right here, so have no fear
Your body's callin', distant lover I will be right here, so have no fear

[Chorus: R. Kelly, (Aaliyah)]
(My body's callin' for you)
Said your body's callin' for me

Girl I know you want me
(My body's callin' for you)
Said your body's callin' for me
(My body's callin' for you)
Girl I know you want me

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
I can tell by the way you flex, that you're horny, hey
Ain't no sense in beatin' round the bush
Tell me you want me (you know you want it)
So stop stalling baby, c'mon in this room yeah

Boy, my body's callin' for you so do what you gotta do (oh yeah)
Are you hungry? (yes I'm hungry, baby)
Do you wanna eat? (Oh)
I said my body's callin' for you
(Here I come running to save you
So put this remix to your ear and tell me
Do you hear what I hear?)
If you're lookin' for the man
That will walk away from responsibility
I ain't the one, I ain't the one, I ain't the one
And if you're lookin' for the brotha
That'll treat you like anything but a queen, I ain't the one

But if you're lookin' for a man
That'll sweep you off your tired weary feet
Pay your bills, buy you pretty dresses

And take you anywhere you wanna eat
Make love to you every night of the week
Oh, don't think it over, girl
Look no further, I am the one, oh yes I am

If you're lookin' for a man
That'll make big money
And keep it all to himself
I ain't the one, no, no, not me

And if you're lookin' for a man
That'll have ten women
And confuse it all with his wealth
Listen here, I ain't that one
No, no, no, wait a minute
If you're lookin' for a man
Who can share his dinero
(His money)
Buy you half the town
(Half the town)

Treat every step you take
(Every step)
As if you're walkin', huh, on holy ground
(Holy ground)

Place you, place you above all others
When it comes, when it comes
To the gettin' on down
(Down)

Look no further, ooh
Your man's around
(He's around)
Oh yes, he is

He's standing right here, right here
(Right here, right here)
Don't you look no further, girl
He's standing right here, right here
I am the one
I am the one

If you're lookin' for a man
That'll make you feel like time has just begun
Ooh, a man that'll make you feel
Like you're the only thing that ever mattered
Underneath the sun, underneath the sun, ooh

If you're lookin' for somebody
Who will turn your bad day
Into one long night of fun
Look no further, baby, I'm, I'm the one

Oh yes, I am, I am the one
Don't you look no further, girl
Oh, I am the one
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, oh
My, my, my little Mayte
He came from Louisiana, close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods up near the evergreens
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
He never ever learned to read or write so well
But he could play the guitar just like a ringing a bell

Go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Johnny B. Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunney sack
And sit beneath the trees by the railroad tracks
Engineers would see him sittin' in the shade
Strummin' to the rhythm that the drivers made
And people passing by would stop and say
My my but that little country boy can play
Go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Go Johnny go go
Johnny B. Goode
Prince
Miscellaneous
Mindbells
Mindbells
Uh oh, there they go lurkin' in my mind
Try 2 stop'em, I am lost in time
So lost, the best that I did is go huntin' 'em down
Everybody thinks I'm crazy, but I know that U're the reason 4 the sound

CHORUS:
Mindbells every time U touch me
Mindbells every time U're near
When U sing with your body, baby
When U sing with your body, baby
Mindbells is all I hear, oh
Mindbells
Listen..
Every time U tell me I'm the one 4 U
And I just can't believe it's me U're talking 2
And my life and destiny, they scare me so
What am I gonna do, I can't let U go
CHORUS
Like the choir sings (la la la la la la)
These mindbells, they ring (ding dong)
I want U now
(Take me)
Oh, mi..mindbells
Mi..mi..mi..mindbells
Can it be these bells I hear ring 4 more than me?
Am I just another star, one of your fantasies?
No baby, baby, don't let it be
Can't U see this love is killing me?
Mindbells every time U touch me (Killing me, yeah)
Mindbells every time U're near (Come near)
When U sing with your body, baby
When U sing with your body, baby
Mindbells is all I hear, oh
CHORUS
=DMX=
Uhh (huh) yeah, it is what it is
Yah'mean? We untouchable baby

=Chorus: Syleena Johnson=
I keep my song in my soul
Blessed my heart and made it go
Tops of our heads to tips of our toes
We're untouchable
Everyday the sun'll shine
Took this dream and made it mine
I'm gettin down one thing that I know (WHAT!)
We're untouchable
=DMX=
We built this Double R thing from the ground up
Another principle of when it's beef, niggas round up
Gettin down like what nigga, YO!
That's all it takes and it's like, HERE WE GO!
Thorough type niggas that control the streets
Rollin deep, holdin heat, don't even think about sleep
When we creep, niggas goin down for the count
It ain't sweet, fuck around and knock money out
C'mon fella, you don't want the dog with the camp
Not Old Yeller, a pitbull and dog is the champ
You know better, think about crossin the line
Hit your sweater, with about ten from the .9
Double R and we get down for life!
Let a nigga KNOW we can go down tonight
From the tops of our heads, the tips of our toes
WHAAAAT! We untouchable, AIGHT?
Yea, WHAT!
=Chorus=
=Cross=
Yea, yeah, YEAH! Be strong..
I represent the have and the have-nots
All the niggas with the weed spots
And all my niggas on them cell blocks
We gon' R-U-double-F R-Y-D-E
You can't fuck with my army
My niggas is untouchable, eatin niggas like Lunchable
.45 be crushin you when the bullets be touchin you
Paul bearers'll carry you
To the cemetary where your momma gon' bury you
Black suit be fittin you nigga, I got hood degrees
Plus I'm street like powder, milk, and government cheese
If you a runnin man nigga, then I'ma shoot up your knees
Then it's me against the world, man against machine
S.D.T.S. - stick to my routine
My knuckle game impeccable, crack game incredible
Lawyers for my niggas who be sittin in the Federal
Nigga, I'm untouchable
=Chorus=
=Infa-Red=
Lyrically I'm, untouchable..
Infa-Red nigga, let's go..
All I can know is 365 days of pain
My name, how to sell cocaine
And I was taught to buy guns so big when I go to the roof
I can aim and shoot down a plane
Infa-Red's my name but fuck all that
Fall back and witness how the streets made me the grimiest nigga alive
I sell you a fake pie, shoot out your fake eye
Give niggas a break, nah; I gotta chase mine
Don't wear your watch around me nigga I take time
Like niggas that them blue tried to like
I turn men to mice, canary yellow my ice
And Ruff Ryde on anybody, to be precise
But I handle my business like I'm supposed to
When you go in the precinct, that's the only time you see my poster
But I could post up and get rid of my pieces
I own collies sellin rocks the size of Domino pizzas
I'm untouchable, nigga
=Chorus=
=Sheek=
Double R.. whoo! All day..
Yo, aiyyo X let me get 'em daddy - yo, yo, yo
U-N-T-O-U-C-H, A-B-L-E-S
Sheek the new Elliott Ness (no doubt)
Nigga, Bloodline, D-Block; two of the best
Hang the Double R chain from the side of the car
Drive by and put your brains on the side of the bar
Sheek heavy in the hood (uh-huh)
And I don't mean cause I gained weight in the hood (nah)
My aim is good, aiyyo X what they want it to be here?
Our hammer's cocked, outside of the house on the lawn chair
Yeah nigga what? The new rap LeBron's here
Get 'em dog, we the new America's nightmare
And we don't say much, we just get it on
That's why we don't get touched, y'all like a dutch
Hands all on you, I'm tryna warn you
To stay in your place, so you don't get laced
And them pretty ass shades, can stay on your face
=Chorus=
=Drag-On=
Uhh, uhh, uhh, c'mon!
You motherfuckers got me back on my grizzly, I'm back on the grind
I'm back to the streets, catch a beef, come back with the nine
I'll murder ya man, come back with his shines
I tote two guns, I don't care if you box, I don't care if you blind
I spit in your eye like niggas is eatin, I'm splittin the pies
Frank Nitty your rap, how gritty am I? The city is mine
Yeah, you get in my way I pity your moms
Yeah, my block is real, my niggas is armed
My borough is thorough, we bang with each other
I'm switchin my diamonds and changin the color
With change of weather, canary in the sun, uhh
I bury ya nigga then bury the gun, X whattup?
Me and you is untouchable (uh-huh)
We both had bricks they couldn't sniff cause the coke was uncrushable
Guns is fingerprint-proof, we "Ryde or Die"
You drivin by, we clap at your ride, good-bye
=Chorus=
Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Now they look as though they're here to stay
Oh I believe in yesterday, oh I believe in yesterday
Suddenly I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me, oh yesterday came suddenly
Why she had to go I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away, oh I believe in yesterday
Why she had to go I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong , now I long for yesterday
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away, oh I believe in yesterday

Has peace arrived
Or, is this some kind of joke?

You don't realise
There's some things you don't own

[Instrumental bridge]

Can you disguise
Can you simplify
This change you put me through?

Can you revive
And will I survive
This life you've brought me to?

Tell me no lies
Has peace arrived
Or this some kind of joke?

Put your dreams away for another day
And I will take their place in your heart
Wishing on a star never got you far
And so it's time to make a new start

When your dreams at night
Fade before you
Then I'll have the right
To adore you

Let your kiss confess this is happiness, darling
And put all your dreams away
We walked through the station
Then you ran and made the train
I just got caught up in the crowd
You turned back our eyes met
You could've sworn I was right behind
Fear kept my feet flat on the ground

Then you vanished with a smile
Like you knew that I would be a while

How did you know
How could you tell
That one day
I'd love you completely
Now we can run
Into the night
How did you know
That we were meant to be
How'd you know to wait for me

The dim light of insight
Through friends I heard your name
And felt the blood rush through my heart
Symptons of something good
That you always understood
How did you know
How could you tell
That one day
I'd love you completely
Now we can run
Into the night
How did you know
That we were meant to be
How'd you know to wait for me

We were just staggering the rhyme
Love is timing without time
And yours had faith in mine

How did you know
How could you tell
That one day
I'd love you completely
Now we can run
Into the night
How did you know
That we were meant to be
How'd you know to wait for me
I wanna love you, yeah, yeah
Over and over again
I wanna see, see what your life, life can be
(Over and over)

Hey, hey, baby
Don't say goodnight when you know
It's time for love

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say goodnight, oh, when you know
I gotta have your love

I wanna feel you
I wanna thrill you, girl
I want to caress you
Ooh, never let you go

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey baby
Don't say goodnight, oh, when you know
(Don't say goodnight)
I gotta have your love
And oh, baby
Don't say goodnight when you know
(Don't say goodnight)
I gotta have your love

Some people say
That life is for the livin'
So let's live it, baby
Yeah

Most of the people say
That love is for the givin'
So let me love you, girl
Yeah

And hey baby
Don't say goodnight, oh, when you know
(Don't say goodnight)
I gotta have your love

And hey baby
Don't say goodnight, oh, when you know
(Don't you ever say goodnight)
I gotta have your love

And ooh-wee, baby
Don't say goodnight
(Don't ever, ever say)
(Don't ever, ever say)
(Ever, ever, ever say)
Don't say goodnight
Don't say goodnight
Dressed in dreams for me
You were what I wished to see
Elizabeth, Elizabeth

Love was very new
Make-believe was coming true
Elizabeth, Elizabeth

You were all much too much
Out of reach out of touch
When you came to me
I found it could never be
Elizabeth, Elizabeth, Elizabeth

So a dream has to end
When it's real not pretend
Dressed in memories
You are what you used to be
Elizabeth, Elizabeth, Elizabeth
Two days before the moon was round
You felt the urge of sun's light beams
The muffled world of dolphin sound
Slipped down and back into your dreams

For nine full months that passed before
You learned of all of life's ancient rhymes
Then mother sensed a farther shore
And brought you forth into these times

So taste the air of your new world
And gently guide us to your mind
It knows the winds and sails unfurled
And holds to heart the dolphin kind

Welcome precious earthmade child
We met you first in your father's songs
And mother's smile and waters wild
It's in this place you now belong

I know you know of all these things
And feel the faith of a dolphin's sigh
For you were born on silver wings
To taste the high blown crystal sky
To sing one day to all of us
The songs you learned in dolphin lair
Giving hope to life as all we must
And teach us how their grace to share

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

And so many of us so easy to give up on our dreams

And so many of us that's raising our hands and saying "war no more"

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus: Yolanda Adams]
I've come through many hard trials
Through temptations on every hand
Though Satan's tried to stop me
And to place my feet on sinking sand
Through the pain and all of my sorrows
Through the tears and all of my fears
The Lord was there to keep me
For He's kept me in the midst of it all

[Verse: Yolanda Adams]
Not because I've been so faithful
Not because I've always obeyed
No, it's not because I trusted Him
To be with me all of the way
But it's because He loves me so dearly
He was there to answer my call
He was there always to protect me
For He's kept me in the midst of it all

[Chorus: Choir, (Yolanda Adams)]
I've come through (Oh yes, I have) many hard trials
(Through temptation on every hand)
Through temptations on every hand
(And Satan was there)
Though Satan's tried to stop me (Trying to stop me)
And to place my feet (On sinking sand) on sinking sand
(Oh, but Jesus loves me so dearly)
But Jesus loves me dearly (Yes, He does)
He was there (He was there) to answer my calls
(To answer every call, yes, He was, He was there)
There always (Always) to protect me
(To protect me, and He kept)
For He's kept me in the midst of it all

[Bridge: Choir, (Yolanda Adams)]
(Oh, no, no, no, He never)
No, he's never (Never) left me (Never left me, yes)
And he's never (He's never let me, never let me fall) let me fall
Oh yes He will (He will) protect you
(Protect you, I know He will)
For He's kept me (He's kept me) in the midst of it all
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
No, he's never (No) left me (He will never leave you)
And he's never let me fall
(Because He never let me fall)
Oh yes (Yes, He will) He will (He will) protect you
(Protect you, yes, He will)
For He's kept me in the midst of it (All, all, all, all, yeah)

[Outro: Yolanda Adams, (Choir)]
Oh, yes (Yes), He kept me (He's kept me)
He kept me when times were hard and rough, yeah, yeah, yeah (Yes)

I thought I could do it on my own
But Jesus, Jesus, Jesus (Yes)

With His power, Jesus kept me (Jesus kept me)

Right there, right there in the midst, in the midst of it all
(In the midst of it all, yes)

But will you allow me to encourage you? (Jesus kept me)

Well, every time I wanna kiss you, it's a I don't know
And every time I wanna hold you, it's a let me go

Well, I'm buzzin' in the circus like a bumble bee
You got me swingin' in the breeze like a monkey in the tree
Goin' mighty cold, I try to warm, warm up

Well, every time I wanna hold you, it's a let me go
Hey, you know what's there to leave me standin' alone, uh uh

Well, I'm buzzin' in the circus like a bumble bee
You got me swingin' in the breeze like a monkey in the tree
Goin' mighty cold, I try to warm, warm up

Well, I'm seein' spots before my eyes
Lighten up like the fire flies
There ain't nothin' that I can do
Until you tell me, baby I need you

Well, don't you think you ought to love me, it's about time
Well, all I want to hear you say is that you're mine
Well you got me mixed up like crushed down fuzz
You treat me like a dog that you're tryin' to muzzle
Goin' mighty cold, I try to warm, warm up

Well, I'm seein' spots before my eyes
Lighten up like the fire flies
There ain't nothin' that I can do
Oh, until you tell me, baby I need you

Well, don't you think you ought to love me, it's about time
Well, all I want to hear you say is that you're mine

Well, I'm buzzin' in a circus like a bumble bee
You got me swingin' in the breeze like a monkey in the tree
Goin' mighty cold attemptin' to warm, warm up
You're mighty cold attemptin' to warm, warm up
You're mighty cold attemptin' to warm, warm up

[Intro]
One day you'll understand Zion

[Verse 1]
Unsure of what the balance held
I touched my belly overwhelmed
By what I had been chosen to perform
But then an angel came one day
Told me to kneel down and pray
For unto me a man child would be born

Woe this crazy circumstance
I knew his life deserved a chance
But everybody told me to be smart
Look at your career they said
"Lauryn baby, use your head"
But instead I chose to use my heart

[Chorus]
Now the joy of my world is in Zion
Now the joy of my world is in Zion

[Verse 2]
How beautiful if nothing more
Than to wait at Zion's door
I've never been in love like this before
Now let me pray to keep you from
The perils that will surely come
See, life for you my prince has just begun

And I thank you for choosing me
To come through unto life to be
A beautiful reflection of his grace
See, I know that a gift so great
Is only one God could create
And I'm reminded every time I see your face

[Chorus]
That the joy of my world is in Zion
Now the joy of my world is in Zion
Now the joy of my world is in Zion
Now the joy of my world is in Zion

[Bridge]

In a fluid and shifting
Creative and destructive
Like water when it burns
Conjunction of opposites
Active/passive principles
Freedom/slave, fire/water

In a fluid and shifting
Creative and destructive
Like water when it burns
Conjunction of opposites
Active/passive principles
Fame/glory, fire/water

In a fluid and shifting
I will drink fire/water
Well, it's been building up inside of me
For, oh, I don't know how long
I don't know why but I keep thinking
Something's bound to go wrong

But she looks in my eyes
And makes me realize
When she says (Don't worry, baby)
Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)
Everything will turn out alright (Don't worry, baby)
Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)

I guess I should've kept my mouth shut
When I started to brag about my car
But I can't back down now because
I pushed the other guys too far

She makes me come alive
And makes me wanna drive
When she says (Don't worry, baby)
Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)
Everything will turn out alright (Don't worry, baby)
Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)
She told me, Baby, when you race today
Just take along my love with you
And if you knew how much I loved you, baby
Nothing could go wrong with you

Oh, what she does to me
When she makes love to me
And she says (Don't worry, baby)
Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)
Everything will turn out alright (Don't worry, baby)
Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)
Everything will turn out alright (Don't worry, baby)
Don't worry, baby (Don't worry, baby)

They call me the wanderer yeah the wanderer

And when she asks me which one I love the best

Oh well I roam from town to town
I go through life without a care
'Til I'm as happy as a clown
With my two fists of iron and I'm going nowhere

I'm never in one place I roam from town to town
And when I find myself a-fallin' for some girl
I hop right into that car of mine and ride around the world

Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day

Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"
I say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are

Yeah, her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh her laugh, she hates, but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for, then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are

The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing just the way you are

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are, yeah

[Verse 1]
Oh yeah
Candles burnin' low
Lots of mistletoe
Lots of snow and ice
Everywhere we go
Choirs singin' carols
Right outside my door

[Chorus]
All these things and more
(All these things and more)
That's what Christmas means to me, my love
(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)
Yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
I see your smilin' face
Like I never seen before
Even though I love you madly
It seems I love you more
And little cards you give me
Will touch my heart for sure

[Chorus]
All these things and more, darling
(All these things and more, darling)
That's what Christmas means to me, my love
(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)

[Bridge]
Oh, I feel like runnin' wild
Like angels and a little child
Greet you 'neath the mistletoe
Kiss you once and then some more
And wish you a Merry Christmas, baby
(Wish you a Merry Christmas, baby)
And such happiness in the coming year
(Happiness in the coming year)

[Verse 3]
Oh, let's deck the halls with holly
Sing sweet Silent Night
Fill a sheet with angel hair
And pretty, pretty lights
We go to sleep and wake up
Just before daylight

[Chorus]
And all these things and more, baby
(All these things and more, baby)
That's what Christmas means to me, my love

That's what Christmas means to me, my love
(That's what Christmas means to me, my love)
Love walked right in, and drove the shadows away
Love walked right in, and brought my sunniest day
One magic moment, and my heart seemed to know - that love said hello
Though not a word was spoken

One look, and I'd forgot the gloom of the past
One look, and I had found my future at last
One look, and I had found a world completely new
When love walked in with you
Darling, I'm so blue without you
I think about you the live-long day
When you ask me if I'm lonely
Then I only have this to say

You'll never know just how much I miss you
You'll never know just how much I care
And if I tried, I still couldn't hide my love for you
You ought to know, for haven't I told you so
A million or more times?

You went away and my heart went with you
I speak your name in my ev'ry prayer
If there is some other way to prove that I love you
I swear I don't know how
You'll never know if you don't know now

You'll never know just how much I miss you
You'll never know just how much I care
You said good-bye, no stars in the sky refuse to shine
Take it from me, it's no fun to be alone
With moonlight and memories

[Verse 1]
He, in a shopping mall, finally met the perfect girl
She is all that matters
The only one in all the world, like a Barbie doll
Oh, love is snakes and ladders
Snakes and ladders

[Verse 2]
She, just to have and hold, is the perfect air-brushed angel
Makes you hot just looking at her
Stapled into all his braincells like a centerfold
Oh, love is snakes and ladders
Snakes and ladders

[Chorus]
Get to the top and slide back down
Get to the bottom, climb back up
Buy the townhouse, call the preacher
Get to the bottom, climb back up
Get to the top and slide back down
Get to the bottom, climb back up
Set up credit for the lovely creature
The lovely creature

[Verse 3]
He, on a corporate climb, set his sights on power for her
On a silver platter
He gave up happy hour for her, Perrier and lime
Oh, love is snakes and ladders
Snakes and ladders

[Verse 4]
She, in a handsome world, put her mind to social graces
All the privileged chatter setting pretty table places
For the girls in pearls
Oh, love is snakes and ladders
Snakes and ladders

[Chorus]
Get to the top and slide back down
Get to the bottom, climb back up
Buy the car phone, call the broker
Get to the bottom, climb back up
Get to the top and slide back down
Get to the bottom, climb back up
Buy the wife a diamond choker
A diamond choker

[Bridge]
True love, true love, true love
He's so nervous
New love, new love, new love
When he's with her
Oh, he's wasting away
True love, true love, true love
It's so curious
New love, new love, new love
Just to kiss her
To kiss her, to kiss her, to kiss her
To kiss her, to kiss her, to kiss her
To kiss her he has to shave

[Verse 5]
She, in the gilded mirrors, in the swing of fancy places
Where the black ties flatter
Started seeing other faces, young fogey financiers
Oh, love is snakes and ladders
Snakes and ladders

[Verse 6]
See in the crimes of time how the seasons steal away
How the rungs are shattered
First you're green, then you're grey, still the snakes unwind
Still playing snakes and ladders
Snakes and ladders

[Chorus]
Get to the top and slide back down
Get to the bottom, climb back up
Sell the vineyard, call the lawyer
Get to the bottom, climb back up
Get to the top and slide back down
Get to the bottom, climb back up
Gather garbage to destroy her
To destroy her

[Outro]
Ladders, ladders, ladders
The perfect girl
Ladders, ladders, ladders
The paper chase
Love is snakes and ladders
Ladders, ladders, ladders
The social whirl
Ladders, ladders
The rat race
Barbie doll

[Intro]
Take my hand

[Bridge]
And this song's my sorry
And this song's my sorry
And this song's my sorry

[Verse 1]
Take my hand

[Bridge]
And this song's my sorry
And this song's my sorry
And this song's my sorry

[Verse 1]
Take my hand
Chicago, Chicago, that toddling town
Chicago, Chicago, I will show you around,I love it
Bet your bottom dollar you'll lose the blues in Chicago, Chicago
The town that Billy Sunday couldn't shut down

On State Street, that great street, I just want to say
They do things they don't do on Broadway
They have the time, the time of their life
I saw a man, he danced with his wife
In Chicago, Chicago, my home town

Chicago, Chicago, that toddlin' town
Chicago, Chicago I'll show you around, I love it
Bet your bottom dollar you lose the blues in Chicago, Chicago
The town that Billy Sunday could not shut down

On State Street, that great street, I just wanna say
They do things that they never do on Broadway, say
They have the time, the time of their life
I saw a man and he danced with his wife
In Chicago, Chicago, Chicago
That's my home town
Well, I work hard everyday
Come home straight with my pay
My baby either drink it up
Or she threw it all away

I'm gonna quit my baby
If she don't stop cheatin' and lyin'
Well, I would rather be alone
Than to be worried out of my mind

Well, I give her all of my money
I think I'm being kind
She buy a quart of bad whiskey

And the rest is beer and wine

Well, a few nights ago
I had to work kinda late
Somebody broke out of my house
Just like he was Superman's mate
Well, four o'clock in the morning, when I staggered in the block
The little moonshine joint and the rest just begin to rock
I sneaked inside to get a better view
I caught my baby doin' the mambo too
The sunday mornin' gospel goes good with the soul
There's blues, folk, and country, and rock like a rollin' stone
The world could come together as one
If everybody under the sun
Add some music to your day
(Add some music add some add some music to your day)
A bob didit a bop didit

You'll hear it while you're walkin' by a neighbor's home
You'll hear it faintly in the distance when you're on the phone
You're sittin' in a dentist's chair
And they've got music for you there
To add some music
(Add some music add some add some music to your)
To your day
A bob didit a bop didit

Add some music music everywhere (add some music)
Add some add some add some add some music (add some music)
Your doctor knows it keeps you calm
Your preacher adds it to his psalms
So add some music
(Add some music add some add some music to your)
To your day
Music
(Add some music add some music)
When you're alone
(Add some music add some music)
Is like a companion
(Add some music add some music)
For your lonely soul
Oo oo oo woo oo woo oo oo oo oooo

When day is over (when day is over)
I close my tired eyes (I close my tired)
Music is in my soul

At a movie you can feel it touching your heart
And on every day of the summertime
You'll hear children chasing ice cream carts
They'll play it on your wedding day
There must be 'bout a million ways
To add some music
(Add some music add some add some music to your)
To your day

Add some music to your day
Add some music to your day
Add some music to your day
Add some music to your day
Add some music to your day
Hey oh, I saw you walkin' by my way so
I thought I would come over and say hello
To you right now
But when I tried to speak the words won't come out
It's you girl, it's definetly something you do girl
That's got my heart beating over time
When you're around
It's like you lift me up and I can come back down
I used to keep my feelings all to me
But now my heart's right on my sleeve for all to see
Because I, I want to be
Every little thing that you want
That you need, that you breathe
And I know it might sound crazy
I think that it's amazing what you do to me
Oh maybe this could truly be
That I'm in love, in love, in love
Oh I'm in love, in love, in love
Oh you're my sunlight
You're my everything's going to be alright
The only thing I need is my life
From day to night my troubles disappear when you hold me tight
And I know I'll never find another like you
So I promise that I'll never let you go
You're all I need, 'cause baby without you I'm just not me
If this is somehow just all a dream
Then please just let me stay
Oh I just want to stay asleep
Because I, I want to be
Every little thing that you want
That you need, that you breathe
And I know it might sound crazy
I think that it's amazing what you do to me
Oh maybe this could truly be
That I'm in love, in love, in love
Oh I'm in love, in love, in love
And if the stars fall from the sky
I'll pick them up for you, baby
'Cause you're the only reason why I wake up in the morning, baby
And it might sound a little too forward for me to say, but I'ma do it anyway
'Cause I think that this could mean, girl
That I, I want to be every little thing that you want
That you need, that you breathe
And I know it might sound crazy
I think that it's amazing what you do to me
Oh maybe this could truly be
That I'm in love, in love, in love
Oh I'm in love, in love, in love

[x18]
Oh, the nights are too long
When the questions are long
I tried, but I will never understand
What Do You See In Him ?
What Do You See In Him ?
Oh ...

She's the lifeblood of me
As you walk hand in hand
And I try, and I try, and I try
But I will never understand
Oh, What Do You See In Him ?
I ask myself :-
What Do You See In Him ?
Oh ...

But she will plague you and I will be glad
Yes, she will plague you and I will be glad
Oh ...
Oh ...
This is my dedication
This is my dedication

I'm not a saint but stand accused
You're with someone who thinks love's the same as being used
And now suspicious minds may say it's over
Over
Whether I live or die, you are my saviour
You're my saviour

It's my déjà vu, sweet déjà vu
Through the feast or famine I'll be with you
Sheltering arms reach out to you
This is my dedication
This is my dedication
This is my dedication
This is my dedication

The silent nights, I cry your name
You're with someone who says
They can get you through your pain
These golden years keep on returning
It's hurting
Precious and few
You're my saviour, you're my saviour
It's my déjà vu, sweet déjà vu
Through the feast or famine I'll be with you
Sheltering arms reach out to you
This is my dedication
This is my dedication
This is my dedication

And cherish what they've lost
When often it's too late

It's my déjà vu (memories of you)
Sweet déjà vu (keep coming through)
Through the feast or famine
I'll be with you (all that is true)
Sheltering arms reach out to you
Oh baby
This is my dedication
This is my dedication
This is my dedication
This is my dedication
Some other time
I could resist you, yes
Some other time
Not now

There is no rhyme
Now that I've kissed you
With all that is me, I thee endow

Imagine me thinking you could never faze me
The tricks my imagination plays me
You smile and this heart of mine betrays me
You know, it's so

Let's take a vow
True love forever
Not some other time
But now

Imagine me thinking you could never faze me
The tricks my imagination plays me
You smile and this heart of mine betrays me
You know, that it's so
Let's take a vow
True love forever
Not some other time
But now
I've been really tryin', baby
Tryin' to hold back this feeling for so long
And if you feel like I feel, baby
Then, c'mon, oh, c'mon
Let's get it on
Baby, let's get it on
Let's love, baby
Let's get it on, sugar
Let's get it on
We're all sensitive people
With so much to give
Understand me, sugar
Since we've got to be here
Let's live, I love you
There's nothing wrong with me
Loving you, baby, no, no
And givin' yourself to me
Can never be wrong
If the love is true, oh baby
Don't you know how sweet and wonderful life can be
I'm askin' you, baby, to get it on with me
I ain't gonna worry, I ain't gonna push
So I won't push you, baby
So c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, baby
Stop beatin' 'round the bush
Let's get it on
Let's get it on
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
C'mon, baby, hey
Let your love come out
If you believe in love
Let's get it on
Let's get it on, baby
This minute, oh yeah
Let's get it on
Please, get it on
I have, I know you know
What I've been dreamin' of
Don't you, baby?
My whole body 

[Incomprehensible] feelin' of love
I have been
I ain't gonna worry, no, I ain't gonna push
I won't push you, baby
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, darlin'
Stop beatin' 'round the bush
Oh, gonna get it on
Threatenin' you, baby
I wanna get it on
You don't have to worry that it's wrong
If the spirit moves ya
Let me groove ya good
Let your come down
Oh, get it on, c'mon, baby
Do you know the meaning?
I've been sanctified, hey hey
Girl, you give me good feelin'
Too good, some like sanctified

[Incomprehensible] baby
Nothing wrong with love
If you want to love me
Do let yourself go, c'mon, baby
I've been, let's get it on
All through the day I dream about the night
I dream about the night here with you
All through the day I wish away the time
Until the time when I'm here with you

Down falls the sun, I run to meet you
The evening mist melts away
Down smiles the moon and soon your lips recall
The kiss I dreamed of all through the day

Down falls the sun, I run to meet you
The evening mist melts away
Down smiles the moon and soon your lips recall
The kiss I dreamed of all through the day
These may be your finest hours
The world is whistling and warm
We have got forgotten powers
You were charming, you could do no harm
Let's just get to the good part (let's get to the good part)
Let's just skip ahead (let's skip ahead)
Come on get to the good part (let's get to the good part)
Why can't we just skip ahead
Every artist falls apart
Thinking he's only only's art
And when the world is lonely and dark
It's a warning not to hitch apart
Let's just get to the good part (let's get to the good part)
Come on skip ahead (let's skip ahead)
Why can't we get to the good part (let's get to the good part)
Come on skip ahead (let's skip ahead)
Skip ahead
C'mon skip ahead
Let's skip ahead
Skip ahead
I can see the anxiety
Of trying to be yourself
But I can't tell you what kind of hell
It is to really think you're somebody else
Let's just get to the good part (let's get to the good part)
Come on let's skip ahead (let's skip ahead)
Come on let's get to the good part (is this the good part)
Why can't we skip ahead
Skip ahead
C'mon skip ahead
Let's skip ahead
Skip ahead
Hastened decrepit
Old shrunken apple
Ready for the pit
I have let you go
Without forgiving

Or understanding
So now, you are gone
There could be nothing
You live within me
We communicate
The light it creates

And the tears it generates
Bring the forgiveness
Forgiveness

Don't let me down, now
Don't let me down, now

Life half sapped away
It took all that time
Since you passed away
To moisten the love
We have forged the sought after
Union brought us together
And the fullness
The completeness

The infinite simplicity
The world offers forgiveness
Forgiveness
Written by Rick Vito and Stevie Nicks

Oh there's a stranger
Standing in the shadows of love
Oh the danger
Demands what you're needing of

Be careful what you love
Be careful what you need
Be careful what you say
Be careful who you please, careful who you please

Love love love
Love is dangerous
Lo-o-o-o-ove
Love is dangerous

Oh there's no warning
That takes you to the promised land
Hearts made of crystal
Crumble like castles of sand
Echoes of emotion
And the visions of a fool
Echoes of forbidden ground
And it's too good to be true, too good to be true

Love love love
Love is dangerous
Lo-o-o-o-ove
Love is dangerous

Standing at the crossroads
Ooh yeah this is wild
Maybe it's my crossroads
Maybe this is mine
Maybe this is mine, oooh

Love love love
Love is dangerous
Lo-o-o-o-ove
Love is dangerous
Don't be a fool

Love love love
Love is dangerous
Lo-o-o-o-ove
Love is dangerous
I don't hold you responsible
All the time I'm alone
I don't think it's unreasonable
So I'll cling all night long

The way you make me feel
You got me so tied up
The way you make me feel
You got me so tied up

The way you make me feel
You got me so tied up
The way you make me feel
You got me so tied up

Here comes the big ideas again
Just like they did before and then
The morning comes again
And they're gone and on and on and on

Here comes the big ideas again
Just like they did before and then
The morning comes again
And they're gone and on and on and on
Here comes the big ideas again
Just like they did before and then
The morning comes again
And they're gone and on and on and on

Here comes the big ideas again
Just like they did before and then
The morning comes again
And they're gone and on and on and on

[Verse 1]
Got nothing but my t-shirt and boxers on
Waiting for you to get home
Its been sunny outside all day baby
I can't wait for it to storm
Wanna feel your raindrops fallin' down all on me
That thunder from down under surrounding me
Coming down hard pounding me

[Chorus]
Let me feel the raindrops fallin' down all over my love
I want it soaken wet all over the bed
I want the rain to come
Let me feel the raindrops fallin' down all over my love
I want it soaken wet all over the bed
I want the rain to come

[Verse 2]
Lights out like a power outage
Cause of the lighting in your bedspring showers
I can feel the mist everytime we kissed
Just didn't know a downpour like this
There's a flash flood warning
Till we wake up in the morning
There'll be puddles in the bed
The weatherman said
Girl the rain is coming

[Chorus]
Let me feel the raindrops fallin' down all over my love
I want it soaken wet all over the bed
I want the rain to come
Let me feel the raindrops fallin' down all over my love
I want it soaken wet all over the bed
I want the rain to come

[Bridge]
Girl the weatherman said...
Its cloudy skies, right there between your thighs
I'm pluckin' for scattered showers, for about an hour
Rain on me tonight
Now let me love you (love you and soon I wanna kiss you)
And girl let me kiss you, (all over you) let me
Sex youuu, (I just want you to) rain on meeee, yeah

[Chorus]
Girl, Let me feel the raindrops fallin' down all over my love
I want it soaken wet all over the bed
I want the rain to come
Let me feel the raindrops fallin' down all over my love
I want it soaken wet all over the bed
I want the rain to come
Let me feel the raindrops fallin' down all over my love
I want it soaken wet all over the bed
I want the rain to come
Let me feel the raindrops fallin' down all over my love
I want it soaken wet all over the bed
I want the rain to come
Troubles, trouble, troubles, troubles is all in the world I see
Troubles, trouble, troubles, troubles is all in the world I see
Oh sometimes I wonder, wonder what is gonna become of me

When I wake up early in the mornin', blues and troubles all around my bed
Oh when I wake up early in the mornin', blues and troubles all around my bed
Oh I never will forget people, the last words I heard my baby said

She said I'm leavin' you in the mornin', BB and cryin' won't make me stay
She said I'm leavin' you in the mornin', BB and your cryin' won't make me stay
Ah the more you cry honey, the farther you're goin' to drive me away

Oh if you just got to go baby, I hope you will come back one day
Oh yes if you just got to go baby, please come on back some day
Oh but I never will forget baby, baby the way we used to love and play

[Chorus]
Kiss me once and kiss me twice
And kiss me once again
It's been a long, long time

[Verse]
Haven't felt like this, my dear
Since can't remember when
It's been a long, long time
You'll never know how many dreams
I dreamed about you
Or just how empty
They all seemed without you

[Chorus]
So kiss me once and kiss me twice
And kiss me once again
It's been a long, long time
Earth angel, earth angel
Will you be mine?
My darling dear, love you all the time
I'm just a fool, a fool in love with you

Earth angel, earth angel
The one I adore, love you forever
And evermore
I'm just a fool, a fool in love with you

I fell for you and I knew
The vision of your love, loveliness
I hope and I pray, that someday
I'll be the vision of your hap, happiness

Oh, earth angel, earth angel
Please be mine?
My darling dear, love you all the time
I'm just a fool, a fool in love with you

I fell for you and I knew
The vision of your loveliness
I hope and I pray, that someday
That I'll be the vision of your happiness
Oh, earth angel, earth angel
Please be mine?
My darling dear, love you all the time
I'm just a fool, a fool in love with you
Disillusions fillin' my head
Never happy, I wished I was dead
Can't remember things I used to know
Take another hit Lord, let the four winds blow
Junkie, junkie man
Feel so lonely, I wish I could cry
Suicidal, not man enough to die
Can't remember ever feelin' this low
Take another hit babe, here I go
Junkie, junkie man
Yonder come a man, Lord he's got my snow
Help me out babe, get down low
But I can't remember things I used to know
The Lord knows I'm to blame
Take another hit Lord, and let the four winds blow
Junkie, junkie man
I guess he'd rather be in Colorado
He'd rather spend his time out where the sky looks like a pearl after a rain
Once again I see him walkin Once again I hear him talking to the stars he makes
And asking them for bus fare
I guess he'd rather be in Colorado
He'd rather play his banjo in the morning when the moon is scarcely gone
In the dawn the subways comin in the dawn I hear him hummin'
Some old song he wrote of love in Boulder Canyon
I guess he'd rather be in Colorado
I guess he'd rather be in Colorado
I guess he'd rather work out where the only thing you earn is what you spend
In the end up in his office
In the end a quiet cough is all he has to show
He lives in New York City
We've got nothin', got nothin' in common
Just nothin' in common
My darling, at all

I love the opera, I detest the best pop
Can't stand the opera, I like music that bops
We're not fated, not heaven-created
We're really mis-mated, our chances are small

Let's part, be real smart
And not start with this romance
'Cause outside of both having stars in our eyes
And outside of sighing the same kind of sighs
We've got nothin' in common at all

We've got nothin', got nothin' in common
Just nothin' in common
It never could last

I love Picasso, he's all style and he's all flair
I've seen Picasso and I think he's a square
Our two goals are apart as the poles are
As lovers our roles are completely miscast
Let's make a clean break
And not take any chances
'Cause outside of thinking you're something divine
And outside of wanting your lips close to mine

We've got nothin' in common
We've got nothin' in common at all

Waiter, separate checks
Oh, baby, please turn yourself around
Oh, baby, so I can love you good
Oh, baby, I'll make you feel so good
Oh, sugar, just like you want me to
Oh, baby, you sure love to ball
Oh, baby, you sure love to ball
Oh, honey, I hope you never freeze
I love you, I love you so much
Oh, baby, baby, don't ever go away
Oh, stay with me, baby, I'll love you night and day
Oh, baby, you sure love to ball
Oh, honey, you sure love to ball
Oh, now I just love you, that's all
I've got my mind made up, baby
Ah, there's no doubt, oh baby
That you're my foxy lady
Oh, baby, you sure love to ball
Oh, sugar, you sure love to ball
Oh, all I know now, baby
Hey, baby, is love you some more
Oh, come on in and let me love you
Oh, baby, climb the wall
Pretty little sexy, baby
You sure love to ball
Pretty little sexy, mama
You sure love to ball
Oh, I know, if we ever part
Oh, that one thing would
Surely break my heart
I gotta get ready for my baby
Ooh, you sure love to ball
Oh, baby, you sure love to ball
Oh, pretty little sexy, baby
You sure love to ball
You sure love to ball
Pretty little sexy, baby
You sure love to ball
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true
I love you more than ever, girl, I do

I want you in the morning, girl, I love you
I want you at the moment I feel blue
I'm living every moment, girl, for you

I've loved you from the moment I saw you
You looked at me that's all you had to do
I feel it now I hope you feel it too

Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true
I love you more than ever, girl, I do, I really love you
The world goes 'round
No one knows what it all means
You're still out there
Looking for a brand new scene
And I'm still here
Never have been hard to find
When new gets old
I'll be playing on your mind
When it all comes down
Look for me I'll still be around
When it all comes down
Look for me I'll still be around
The day will come
When there's nothing new to see
And then you'll know
Here is where you want to be
You know my song
Used to take your heart away
That same old feelin'
Is gonna bring you back to stay
When it all comes down
Look for me I'll still be around
When it all comes down
Look for me I'll still be around
When it all comes down
Look for me I'll still be around
When it all comes down
Look for me I'll still be around
When it all comes down
Look for me I'll still be around
When it all comes down
Look for me I'll still be around
When it all, yes it will
I'll still be around
When it all comes down
I'll still be around
When it all comes down
When I first met you, said you would be mine
Found out later you was tellin' me a lie
And now I'm walkin', walkin' and cryin'
You don't love me no more

Now if there's one thing that I just can't stand
Can't stand to see you with another man
Because I'm walkin', walkin' and cryin'
You don't love me no more

I did all for you, did all I could
All I did darlin', it didn't do me no good
And now I'm walkin', walkin' and cryin'
You don't love me no more

Now I'm goin' on, goin' on my way
I know you don't love me now darlin'
But you will some old day
Because I'm walkin', walkin' and cryin'
You don't love me no more

[Verse 1]
I'm a fool to want you
I'm a fool to want you
To want a love that can't be true
A love that's there for others too

[Verse 2]
I'm a fool to hold you
Such a fool to hold you
To seek a kiss not mine alone
To share a kiss the Devil has known

[Chorus]
Time and time again I said I'd leave you
Time and time again I went away
But then would come the time when I would need you
And once again these words I'll have to say

[Verse 3]
Take me back, I love you
Pity me, I need you
I know it's wrong, it must be wrong
But right or wrong I can't get along
Without you
You don't laugh anymore, when we're alone
You don't talk quite as long, when we're on the phone
You say that you, still love me so
But I can read between the lines

You don't hear half the things, that I say to you
You don't hold me as close, as you used to do
You say that you, won't let me go
But I can read between the lines

Your love for me is over
It isn't hard to tell
In every single thing you do
You say it all too well

And the glow in your eyes, is there no more
When you speak of the plans, that you have in store
It's time my dear, that I let you know
That I can read between the lines
Now the weekend's here
I plan to have some fun
Take you out in my Oldsmobile, and head for the country, hon
Say, hey! It's a fine day! Yeh, yeh, such a fine day
Say, hey! It's a fine day! I hope to hear you headin' my way

Yeh, yeh! It’s a fine day! Checkbook on another fine day
Hey, hey! It’s a fine day! I’m glad to see you headin’ my way

Friday night I took you dancin’!
We danced all the way
Sunday mornin’ we relaxin’
At your mother’s home
Hey, it’s a fine day! Sha-yay-yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh-yeh it’s a fine day, fine day
Oh yeh, it’s a fine day. I’m glad to see you headin’ my way

Oh yeh yeh yeh yeh yeh

Well, should leave I took her to the evening classes
Where you learn to read a book
Wednesday morning took me to the playground
Were you lead to take a look?
Hey! It’s a fine day! Yeh yeh, ha ha ha oh, such a fine day!
Ha ha ha hey hey, it’s a fine day! I’m glad to see you headin’ my way
Oh hey hey! It’s a fine day! Hey, hey! Such a fine day!
Hey hey it’s a fine day! And I’m glad to see you headin’ my way
Hey hey! A fine day! Hey such a fine day! hey it’s such a fine day!
Without you , stood alone on the edge of time
Out of sight,but forever mine, without you
Sometime's there's no forgetting the night
When you reach for the stars ,just to be where it's bright
But you left me behind , what a crazy goodbye

Without you, there ain't no love at all
And without you , there ain't no plans at all
Without you , ev'rything's lost to the wind
You were the love I was in
How can I try to be me
Without you

Without you, watching you take the world from me
Leaving me with a memory about you
Sometime's there's no forgetting the place
Where you told me goodbye ,like a slap in the face
Where you tore me apart and I learned how to cry

Without you , there ain't no love at all
And without you , there ain't no plans at all
Without you , ev'rything's lost to the wind
You were the love I was in
How can I try to be me
Without you , there ain't no love at all
Without you baby, there ain't no plans at all
Girl, without you , ev'rything's lost to the wind
You were the love I was in
How can I try to be me, me
Without you , without you honey , ah...
Without you , ev'rything's lost ...
Ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

It's real late, 'bout a quarter to one
Thinking about everything we become
And I hate it
I thought we could make it

But I'm ready to dead this
Just wanna forget about it
I saw her pictures
And the letters she sent

You had me thinking
You were out with your friends
I'm so foolish
Play me like I'm stupid
'Cause I thought it was just you and I
Now I look back on the time
That we spent and I
See it in my mind
Playing over and over again

'Cause boy right now
You got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why
But this is what you say

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

Visions in my mind
Of the day that we met
You showed me things
That I'll never forget

Took me swimming
In the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Made me feel like I'm floating
You think I'm playing
When you know it's the truth
Nobody else can do it quite like I do
All my kisses
And my loving
But ain't nobody better than us

Now I look back on the time
That we spent and I
See it in my mind
Playing over and over again
'Cause boy right now
You got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

I guess it's over indefinitely
But you and I know
It's not that easy to let go
Of everything that we planned
And start all over again
Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it
I won't forget how you do it
Sweet baby this is where the game ends now
Somehow wanna believe you and me
We can figure it out

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

You finna make me say boy
I wish that you come hold me
When I'm lonely
When I need someone to talk to

You would phone me
Just like everything you told me
(When we ride we ride, it's till the day we die)
Boy you forgot about the promises you made me
And now we'll let the memories just fade away
But I remember what you used to say
(When we ride we ride, it's till the day we die)

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die

We ride
You never treated me gentle
Yet you spend up all of my gold
Then you look around for a young man
Tell me I'm too old
That's why we can't agree
Yeah, baby, we can't agree

Now if I don't see you no more, baby
It'll be way too soon for me
You're known for being a lover
You like to holler loud
One man for you ain't nothing
You talk so loud you draw a crowd
That's why we can't agree
Yes, baby, we can't agree
Now if I don't see you no more, baby
It'll be way too soon for me

You're used to eating hot dogs
When you go out to dine
I taught you what a steak was
And now you've almost lost your mind
That's why we can't agree
Yes, baby, we can't agree
Now if I don't see you no more, baby
Honey, that'll be way too soon for me
You know it will
Now your clothes look like a sifter
Because they had so many holes
You know we both
Came from the ghetto, baby
And everybody knows
We can't agree
Yes, baby, we can't agree
Now if I don't see you
No more, little woman
Honey, it'll be way too soon for me
Yes, it will

Another one of them crazy endings
That's the only way I could get out of it
When I'm on my own
And out of my mind
I realize how I've grown
And changed my old line

Learning how to give
And not be afraid
Of the place where I live
And mistakes I have made
Oh, oh, oh

You are the one changing my life
You are the one making it right
You are the one warming my nights
You are the one

You are the one giving me all
You are the one opening doors
You are the one hearing my call
You are the one
Looking 'round I can see
You are still here
Not in sight but in me
Your being appears
Oh, oh, oh

You are the one changing my life
You are the one making it right
You are the one warming my nights
You are the one

You are the one giving me all
You are the one opening doors
You are the one hearing my call
You are the one

You are the one changing my life
You are the one making it right
You are the one warming my nights
You are the one

You are the one giving me all
You are the one opening doors
You are the one hearing my call
You are the one
Shine on me sunshine
Walk with me world
It's a skip-a-dee-doo-dah day
I'm the happiest girl in the whole U.S.A

Good morning, morning, hello sunshine
Wake up sleepy head
Why'd we move on that bojangle clock
So far away from the bed?

Just one more minute, that's why we moved it
One more hug or two
Do you love wakin' up next to me
As much as I love wakin' up next to you?

Well you make the coffee and I'll make the bed
I'll fix your lunch and you'll fix mine
Now tell me the truth, do these old shoes look funny?
Honey, it's almost nine

Now you be careful, gotta go
I love you, have a beautiful day
And kiss the happiest girl in the whole U.S.A
Skip-a-dee-doo-dah
Thank you Lord for making him for me
And thank you for making life turn out
The way I always thought it should be

There once was a time when I could not imagine
How it would feel to say
I'm the happiest girl in the whole U.S.A

Shine on me sunshine
Walk with me world
It's a skip-a-dee-doo-dah day
I'm the happiest girl in the whole U.S.A
The Lion of Judah shall break every chain
The Lion of Judah shall break every chain
The Lion of Judah shall break every chain, chain, chain
Give us Jah victory again and again

The Conquering Lion shall break every chain
The Conquering Lion shall break every chain
The Conquering Lion shall break every chain, chain, chain
Give us Jah victory again and again

The Lion of Judah shall break every chain
The Lion of Judah shall break every chain
The Lion of Judah shall break every chain, chain, chain
Give us Jah victory again and again
Give us Jah victory again and again

In Mount Zion
With King Alpha and Queen Omega
Father and Mother of Creation
Alleluia!

[Verse 1]
Baby, can't you see I'm calling?
A guy like you should wear a warning
It's dangerous, I'm fallin', I'm fallin', I'm fallin'
There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit, baby, give me it
You're dangerous, I'm lovin' it, I'm lovin' it, I'm lovin' it

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?
(Can you feel me now? Can you feel me now?)

[Chorus]
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic? (Toxic, toxic)
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic? (Toxic, toxic)
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
Don't you know that you're toxic?

[Verse 2]
It's getting late to give you up
I took a sip from my devil's cup
Slowly, it's taking over me (Taking over me, taking over me)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Too high, can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Can you feel me now?
(Can you feel me now? Can you feel me now?)

[Chorus]
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic? (Toxic, toxic)
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic? (Toxic, toxic...)
Don't you know?....
Don't you know that you're toxic?
Don't you know that you're toxic?
Don't you know that you're toxic?
It's taking over me

[Outro]
Intoxicate me now with your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now
Intoxicate me now with your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now, now, now
Intoxicate me now with your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now (I think I'm ready now)
Intoxicate me now with your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now, now

[Chorus]
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic? (Toxic, toxic)
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic? (Toxic, toxic)
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic? (Toxic, toxic...)
It came upon the midnight clear, that glorious song of old
From angels bending near the earth to touch their harps of gold
Peace on the earth, goodwill to men, from heav'n's all gracious king
The world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing

Still through the cloven skies they come with peaceful wings unfurl
And still their heavenly music floats, O'er all the weary world
Above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing
And ever o'er its Babel sounds the blessed angels sing

O ye, beneath life's crushing load, whose forms are bending low
Who toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow
Look now for glad and golden hours come swiftly on the wing
O rest beside the weary road and hear the angels sing

For lo the days are hastening on, by prophets seen of old
When with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold
When the new heaven and earth shall own the prince of peace their King
And the whole world send back the song which now the angels sing

[Intro]
Bounce...

[Verse 1]
All, all I wanna do
Is see your body move
I know you want it too
So what you gonna do?
Can you smell the bass?
Taste a little snare
The look up on your face
Shows me that you are going there
Steppin' at your best
Clubbin' all night long
The sweat rolls down your chest
As you dance to this song

[Pre-Chorus]
(You want it) You want it

Please come back, to my paradise
I work for the Union Pike
Out on the Western Line
I found Uncle Sean in Denver
And he and his wife are fine
They send their best
And like the rest -
They send home the slates

It took six months from the Cobh
Another six by land
But the pay is good
And as I should
I'll send home the slates

Back on your feet
Now lads
Our time for writing home has passed
Six miles to spike today
That's what we need
So fast lads
We must advance
Work to the Gandy dance
Six days to double pay
That's our reward -
But not 'til the line goes down
I'll not send empty letters
I know you need the rent
Dad, you deserve a new pair of boots
I know it's money well spent
So kind regards
I'll work hard -
To send home the slates

PS. Dear Ma
I send my picture
Don't let the family forget me...
I wonder why nobody don't like me
Or is it the fact that I'm ugly?
I wonder why nobody don't like me
Or is it the fact that I'm ugly?
I leave my whole house and home
My children don't want me no more
Bad talk inside de house dey bring
And when I talk they start to sing:
Mama, look a boo-boo they shout
Their mother tell them shut up your mout'
That is your daddy, oh, no
My daddy can't be ugly so
Shut your mout', Go away
Mama, look at boo-boo dey
Shut your mout', Go away
Mama, look at boo-boo dey
I couldn't even digest me supper
Due to the children's behavior
John (Yes, pa)-come here a moment
Bring de belt, you're much too impudent
John says it's James who started first
James tells the story in reverse
I drag my belt from off me waist
You should hear them screamin' round de place
Mama, look at boo-boo they shout
Their mother tell them shut up your mout'
That is your daddy, oh, no
My daddy can't be ugly so
Shut your mout', Go away
Mama, look at boo-boo dey (uh)
Shut your mout', Go away
Mama, look at boo-boo dey (uh)
So I began to question the mother
These children ain't got no behavior
So I began to question the mother
These children ain't got no behavior
They're playing with you my wife declared
You should be proud of them, my dear
These children were taught too bloomin' slack
That ain't no kind of joke to crack
Mama, look at boo-boo they shout
Their mother tell them shut up your mout'
That is your daddy, oh, no
My daddy can't be ugly so
Shut your mout', Go away
Mama, look at boo-boo dey (uh)
Shut your mout', Go away
Mama, look at boo-boo dey (uh)
Shut your mout', Go away

I was walking down the high street
When I heard footsteps behind me
And there was a little old man (Hello!)
In scarlet and gray, chuckling away

Well, he trotted back to my house
And he sat beside the telly (Ahh!)
With his tiny hands on his tummy
Chuckling away, laughing all day

"I ought to report you to the Gnome Office."
"Gnome Office? Ahahahah!"

Ha, ha, ha, hee, hee, hee
I'm a laughing gnome and you can't catch me
Ha, ha, ha, hee, hee, hee
I'm a laughing gnome and you can't catch me
Said the laughing gnome

Well, I gave him roasted toadstools
And a glass of dandelion wine. (*burp* Pardon...)
Then I put him on a train to Eastbourne
Carried his bag, and gave him a fag
"Have you got a light, boy?"
"Here, where do you come from?"
"Gnome-man's land, heehee!"
"Oh, really?"

In the morning, when I woke up
He was sitting on the edge of my bed
With his brother, whose name was Fred
He'd brought him along to sing me a song

"Alright, let's hear it... 'ere, what's that clicking noise?"
"That's Fred, he's a metro-gnome, haha!"

Ha, ha, ha, hee, hee, hee
I'm a laughing gnome and you can't catch me
Ha, ha, ha, hee, hee, hee
I'm a laughing gnome and you can't catch me

"Oh now, I'm a gnome, anyway, haha!"
"Haven't you got a home to go to?"
"No, we are gnome-ads, hehe!"
"Didn't they teach you to get your hair cut at school?
You look like a rolling gnome."
"Nah, not at the London school of Eco-gnome-ics."

Now they're staying up me chimney
And we're living on caviar and honey (Hurray!)
'Cause they're earning me lots of money
Writing comedy prose for radio shows
"It's the, errrr... it's the gnome-service, yes, of course!"

Ha, ha, ha, hee, hee, hee
I'm a laughing gnome and you...
Ha, ha, ha, hee, hee, hee
(Oh, dear me...)
I'm a laughing gnome and you can't catch me
(One more time!)
Ha, ha, ha, hee, hee, hee
I'm a laughing gnome and you can't catch me
Here goes, looks like I 'm falling, call me devil-may care
I know it shouldn't be, but you know me, pal, I'll take a dare
Who knows but this time I may be lucky, this may be on the square
Here goes, it's an adventure, just call me devil-may-care
I'll get by,as long as I have you
Though there be rain and darkness too
I'll not complain, I'll see it through
Poverty, may come to me, that's true
But what care I, say
I'll get by, as long as have you
Open up your eyes and see the brand new day
Clear blue sky and brightly shining sun
Open up your ears and hear the breeze essay
Everything that's cold and gray is gone

Open up your hands and feel the rain come on down
Taste the wind and smell the flowers sweet perfume
Open up your mind and let the light shine in
The earth has been reborn and life goes on

And do you care what's happening around you?
Do your senses know the changes when they come?
Do you see yourself reflected in the season?
Do you understand the need to carry on?

Riding on the tapestry of all there is to see
So many ways and oh so many things
Rejoicing in the differences there's no one just like me
Yet as different as we are we're still the same

And oh I love the life within me
I feel a part of everything I see
And oh I love the life around me
A part of everything is here in me
A part of everything is here in me
Now the day another day to waste mine
Hand, can you see em now
Oh don't mess with the..keep on it
No settle on the back of the leisure pony
No settle on the back of the leisure pony
No settle on the back of the leisure pony
Leisure shock I think I see the breaks move
Oh, can you see me now
Oh don't mess with the..I can't keep ..
No settle on the back of the leisure pony
Don't save your kisses, just pass 'em around
You'll find my reason is logically sound
Who's gonna know that you pass them around
A hundred years from today

Why crave a penthouse, that's fit for a queen
You're nearer heaven on mother earth's green
If you had millions what would they all mean
One hundred years from today

So laugh and sing, make love the thing
Be happy while you may
There's always one beneath the sun
Who's bound to make you feel that way

The moon is shining and that's a good sign
Cling to me closer say you'll be mine
Remember, baby, we won't see it shine
A hundred years from today
One hundred years from today
Writer(s): Taylor/Lane

Everybody loves somebody sometime
Everybody falls in love somehow
Something in your kiss just told me
(That) My sometime is now

Everybody finds somebody someplace
There's no telling where love may appear
Something in my heart keeps saying
(That) My someplace is here

If I had it in my power
I'd arrange for every girl to have your charm
Then every minute, every hour
Every boy would find what I've found in your arms

Everybody loves somebody sometime
And although my dream was overdue
Your love made it well worth waiting
For someone like you
Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone
Susanne the plans they made put an end to you
I woke up this morning and wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to

I've seen fire and I've seen rain
Seen sunny days that I thought would never end
Seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought I'd see you again

Won't you look down upon me Jesus you got to help me make a stand
You just got to see me through another day
My body's aching, my time is at hand
I just can't make it any other way

I've seen fire and I've seen rain
Seen sunny days that I thought would never end
Seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought I'd see you again

I've been walking my mind to an easy time my back turned t'wards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it will turn your head around
There's hours of time on the telephone line they'll talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
Seen sunny days that I thought would never end
Seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought I'd see you one more time again
Have you ever wanted something, wanted it so fuckin' bad
That you'd lie, that you'd cheat, that you'd fight in the street
A chance to lose what little you had
Maybe you know I'll be there, maybe you know I'll be there
Maybe you know I'll be there, compared to you, I don't seem so mean
I've been hearin' for a long time
I've been hearin' about some loser band
Ain't gettin' younger, but I ain't goin' under
I was promised to rock & roll, this is sad
Time is only wasted, talkin' that will take your life
When it all comes down, we're a couple of bums
I know I'll get more tonite
Now you don't owe me nothin', don't take it so personally
There's only one way to make it today and I'm doing all I can for me
Night and day
You are the one
Only you beneath the moon
And under the sun
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter, darling, where you are
I think of you, night and day

Day and night, why is it so
That this longing for you
Follows wherever I go
In the roaring traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you, night and day

Night and day, under the hide of me
There's an oh, such a hungry yearning
Burning inside of me
And it's torment won't be through
Till you let me spend my life making love to you
Day and night, night and day
Oh you are the one

Only you beneath the moon and under the sun

Whether near to me or far
It's no matter, darling, where you are
I think of you, night and day

Night and day, under the hide of me
There's an oh, such a hungry yearning
Burning inside of me
And it's torment won't be through
Until you let me spend my life making love to you
Day and night, night and day

Only can the spirit
Turn the world around

We are of the spirit
Truly of the spirit

[Verse 1: Wanya Morris]
There's a girl I know who looks so fine, she really turns me on
My friends said I should, but it's taking me too long
Every time I get the nerve to call, she is never home
I leave another message and I sit here all alone, she's got me

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
Under pressure
And the feelin' she's giving me
Under pressure
Why you said oh so strong that you don't want to be alone

[Verse 2: Wanya Morris]
So I got a chance to talk to her to see just where we stand
If she felt the same about me, could I be her only man?
I tried to let it out and we could have some fun
But before I got an answer, she said she had to run, it's got me

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
Under pressure
Oh oh oh, and the feeling is killing me
Under pressure
Oh, I don't wanna be alone, oh no
Under pressure
Under pressure, under pressure, the feeling is killing me
Under pressure
Oh, why is it so strong?

[Bridge: Michael McCary]
Ba-doom-doom, ba-doom-doom

Ba-doom-doom, ba-doom-doom
Ba-doom-doom, ba-doom-doom
Ba-doom-doom

Ba-doom-doom, ba-doom-doom

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
Under pressure
Under pressure
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh
Under pressure
Oh, oh, the feeling is killing me
Under pressure
Just pay attention to me, baby, I need you
Under pressure
I want you, gotta have you, oh oh oh
Under pressure
Please baby, please let me explain
Under pressure
Under pressure
Give it to me, ha ha, just let me explain, baby
Do you remember days not so very long ago
When the world was run by people twice your size
And the days were full of laughter and the nights were full of stars
And when you grew tired you could close your eyes

Yes the stars were were there for wishing and the wind was there for kites
And the morning sun was there for rise and shine
And even if the sniffles kept you home from school in bed
You couldn't hardly stay there after nine

And I wonder if the smell of morning's faded
What happened to the robin's song that sparkled in the sky
Where's all the water gone that tumbled down the stream
Will I ever catch another butterfly

Do you remember campouts right in your own backyard
And wondering how airplanes could fly
And the hours spent just playing with a funny rock you found
With crystal specks as blue as all the sky

Yes, the days were each a treasure as they blended into years
The memories that come so sharp and plain
And while we were enjoying these moments, did we mourn
That today would never come this way again
And I wonder if the smell of morning's faded
What happened to the robin's song that sparkled in the sky
Where's all the water gone that tumbled down the stream
Will I ever catch another butterfly

Now I watch my son, he's playing with his toys
He's happy and I give him all I can
But I can't help feeling just a little tingling inside
When to hear him say, he wants to be a man

And I wonder if the smell of morning's faded
What happened to the robin's song that sparkled in the sky
Where's all the water gone that tumbled down the stream
Will I ever catch another butterfly
Will I ever catch another butterfly
I may not always love you
But long as there are stars above you
You never need to doubt it
I'll make you so sure about it

God only knows what I'd be without you

If you should ever leave me
Though life would still go on, believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me?

God only knows what I'd be without you

And God only knows what I'd be without you

If you should ever leave me
Though life would still go on, believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me?
God only knows what I'd be without you

And God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you

Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no lucky charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends
Start my day up on the roof
There's nothing like this type of view
Point the clicker at the tube
I prefer expensive news
New car, new girl
New ice, new glass
New watch, good times babe
It's good times, yeah
She wash my back three times a day
This shower head feels so amazing
We'll both be high, the help don't stare
They just walk by, they must don't care
A million one, a million two
A hundred more will never do
Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no lucky charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Oh, real love
Close your eyes for what you can't imagine, we are the xany gnashing
Caddy smashing, bratty ass, he mad, he snatched his daddy's Jag
And used the shit for batting practice, adamant and he thrashing
Purchasing crappy grams with half the hand of cash you handed
Panicking, patch me up, Pappy done latch keyed us
Toying with Raggy Anns and mammy done had enough
Brash as fuck, breaching all these aqueducts; don't believe us
Treat us like we can't erupt, yup
We end our day up on the roof
I say I'll jump, I never do
But when I'm drunk I act a fool
Talking 'bout , do they sew wings on tailored suits
I'm on that ledge, she grabs my arm
She slaps my head
It's good times, yeah
Sleeve rips off, I slip, I fall
The market's down like 60 stories
And some don't end the way they should
My silver spoon has fed me good
A million one, a million cash
Close my eyes and feel the crash
Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no lucky charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends
Real love (ain't that something rare)
I'm searching for a real love (talking 'bout real love)
Real love yeah
Real love
I'm searching for a real love
Talking 'bout a real love

[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Mother Mary come to me
For I am a wicked child
I've sinned and I am so confused
And I am a wicked child
I am a wicked child

[Verse 2]
I am the devil's son
And I wish I could be good
I walk a crooked mile
Yet I wish I could be good
I wish I could be good

[Verse 3]
If I could've kept
On the straight and narrow
If I could've kept
On the straight and narrow, and not have broke your heart
Not have broke your heart

[Verse 4]
Now I wake up in the night
It's tugging at my arms and legs like I was a marionette
Send baby Jesus to radiate his light
To radiate his light
No easy answers
Come to me that I can see
No easy answers
Were close at hand when I began
To ask the questions one by one
So all the loose ends stayed undone

An easy answer
Could help me out, relieve my doubt
Is there an answer?
Or will I be never to see
The light that shines at journey's end
Or will I just go around again?

You know it's always easy to say
You've gotta take it day by day
But sometimes it can be hard
Oh, hard

You know the answer's undefined
It's only ever in your mind
You know it's always easy to say
You've gotta take it day by day
But sometimes it can be hard
Oh, hard
We've been hanging out all night
Everything's been so nice
Wish I didn't have to go
Feeling sexy in your bedly
Touching me so gently
But I gotta get home

So many things to tell ya
So long since I held ya
Ooh boy you just don't know
Just don't know
So here's my proposition
Don't speak boy just listen
Before we go down this road

Take me the long way home
I'm not trying to leave you know
Ain't no rush so can you slow down
Take me the long way home
I know that we're pulling up
And circle around the block
So we can touch some more
Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home

Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home

Wish I could stay all night
But I just can't tonight
Cause I gotta be up at 6
Boy you made my heart melt
When you undid my seatbelt
And told me to come give you a kiss

So many things to tell ya
So long since I held ya
Ooh boy you just don't know
Just don't know
So here's my proposition
Don't speak boy just listen
Before we go down this road
Take me the long way home
I'm not trying to leave you know

Ain't no rush so can you slow down
Take me the long way home
I know that we're pulling up
And circle around the block
So we can touch some more
Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home

Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home

Something about you makes me wanna drive all night all night all night long
I can't wait when till the next time I see you (uh) home home

Take me the long way home
I'm not trying to leave you know
Ain't no rush so can you slow down
Take me the long way home
I know that we're pulling up
And circle around the block
So we can touch some more

Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home

Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home
Your telling me ain't no rush to stay there's no delay oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh...

Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home

Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home
Ah babe ah baby just take me the long way home
Writer(s): Gershwin/Gershwin

The odds were a hundred to one against me
The world thought the heights were too high to climb
But people from Missouri never incensed me
Oh, I wasn't a bit concerned
For from hist'ry I had learned
How many, many times the worm had turned

They all laughed at Christopher Columbus
When he said the world was round
They all laughed when Edison recorded sound
They all laughed at Wilbur and his brother
When they said that man could fly

They told Marconi
Wireless was a phony
It's the same old cry
They laughed at me wanting you
Said I was reaching for the moon
But oh, you came through
Now they'll have to change their tune
They all said we never could be happy
They laughed at us and how!
But ho, ho, ho!
Who's got the last laugh now?

They all laughed at Rockefeller Center
Now they're fighting to get in
They all laughed at Whitney and his cotton gin
They all laughed Fulton and his steamboat
Hershey and his chocolate bar

Ford and his Lizzie
Kept the laughers busy
That's how people are
They laughed at me wanting you
Said it would be, "Hello, Goodbye."
But oh, you came through
Now they're eating humble pie

They all said we'd never get together
Darling, let's take a bow
For ho, ho, ho!
Who's got the last laugh?
Hee, hee, hee!
Let's at the past laugh
Ha, ha, ha!
Who's got the last laugh now?

[Verse]
Whoa, ah, mercy, mercy me
Ah, things ain't what they used to be, no, no
Where did all the blue skies go?
Poison is the wind that blows from the north and south and east
Whoa, mercy, mercy me
Ah, things ain't what they used to be, no, no
Oil wasted on the oceans and upon our seas
Fish full of mercury
Ah, ah, oh, mercy, mercy me
Ah, things ain't what they used to be, no, no
Radiation underground and in the sky
Animals and birds who live nearby by are dying
Oh, mercy, mercy me
Ah, things ain't what they used to be
What about this overcrowded land?
How much more abuse from man can she stand?
Ooh, oh, na, na, na na na
Na na na na na, my my, my sweet Lord

[Verse 1]
When can we get together again?
Nevermind, I've lost you
How can I tell if I love you anymore
Nevermind, I know I do

[Verse 2]
Call you closer to my arms
You'll feel better when you're warm
Do you like it when you leave your house?
Do you like it when you're in a town?
That you love
Like one I live in
Like one I live in

[Hook]
It's my body's plan

[Bridge]
I feel another
Time out
With my love
Slow down
I feel another
Time out
With my life
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down

[Hook]
It's my body's plan

[Outro]
Make another telephone call
Think of you and me
Make another telephone call
Think of you and me
Make another telephone call
Think of you and me
Make another telephone call
Think of you and me
Make another telephone call
Think of you and me
Make another telephone call
Think of you and me
Make another telephone call
Think of you and me
Make another telephone call
Think of you and me
The one I love belongs to somebody else
She means her tender songs for somebody else
And even when I have my arms around her
I know her thoughts are strong for somebody else
The hands I held belong to somebody else
I'll bet they're not so cold to somebody else
It's tough to be alone on the shelf
It's worse to fall in love by yourself
The one I love belongs to somebody else
The one I love belongs to somebody else
We should never write ourselves off
See ourselves as the victims of various forces
It is always our decision
Tell me I am responsible

Satisfying feeling of connection maybe
Transient but tide-moving
Over momentary
It is what we live for
From becoming to be

It is always our decision
It's the feeling of connection

Depends on our actions
Can't see ourselves as the victims

It's been a long time
Since anyone come to me to call on my deeper senses
Thank you so much
You spoke to me in a way that revived my life essences
It feels so good
Feels alive and relating
It feels so good
I can connect with the world
Goodnight
Tired little eyes
Time to climb the wooden hill

Sleep tight
Safe in the night
Wander through your dreams at will

The stars are awake
And blinking their silvery tears on the moon
Don't be afraid
For carpets of magic can fly through the sky
It will take you wherever you wish
But come back to me
The same way that you leave
In day or night, in dark or light
Just come back to me
The same way that you leave
Then you can always find me in your dreams
One, two, one, two, three

Should old acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind
Should old acquaintance be forgot
And days of Auld Lang Syne

For Auld Lang Syne, my dear
For auld Lang Syne
For auld Lang Syne
May old acquaintance be forgot
And days of Auld Lang Syne

[Intro]
I am a vampire!
(Percentage of us tow the line
The rest of us is out of reach
Everybody, party time
Some of us will never sleep again)
Rest is good for the blood!

[Verse 1]
Percentage of us tow the line
The rest of us is out of reach
Everybody, party time
Some of us will never sleep again

[Chorus]

Dracula, Dracula
Dracula, Dracula

Percentage of us tow the line
The rest of us is out of reach
Everybody, party time
Some of us will never sleep again

People making lists, buying special gifts
Taking time to be kind to one and all
It's that time of year when good friends are dear
And you wish you could give more
Than just presents from a store

Why don't you give love on Christmas Day?
Oh, even the man who has everything
Would be so happy if you would
Bring him love on Christmas Day
No greater gift is there than love

People you don't know smiling out hello
Everywhere there's an air of Christmas joy
It's that once a year when the world's sincere
And you'd like to find a way
To show the things that words can't say

Why don't you give love on Christmas Day?
The man on the street and the couple upstairs
All need to know there's someone cares
Give love on Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
No greater gift is there than love
What the world needs is love
Yes, the world needs your love

Why don't you give love on Christmas Day?
Oh, every little child on Santa's knee
Has room for your love underneath his tree
Give love on Christmas Day, on Christmas Day
No greater gift is there than love

What the world needs is love
Yes, the world needs your love

Give love on Christmas Day
Oh, even the man who has everything
Would be so happy if you would
Bring him love on Christmas Day
No greater gift is there than love

What the world needs is love, yes
Give love on Christmas Day
Oh, everybody needs, we need love
Why don't you give love on Christmas Day?
No greater gift is there than love
Take it from me, don't be a do-badder up
Do-badder up, do bother to put your foot up
That ladder that leads you to that place
Below and every day you lose other you
Feel sadder you get madder so use the other
Step ladder you climb the other way
Scrapping and fighting, scratching and fighting
Cheating and acting. selfish makes your heart
Like a part of the hardest heart, so selfish
Take it from me, don't you be a do-badder up
A do-badder up, a do-badder up, just step up for that
Step ladder and climb the other way
There is a river that runs from the mountains
That one river is all rivers
All rivers are that one

There is a tree that stands in the forest
That one tree is all forests
All trees are that one

There is a flower that blooms in the desert
That one blossom is all flowers
All flowers are that one

There is a bird that sings in the jungle
That one song is all music
All songs are that one

It is the song of life
It is the flower of faith
It is the tree of temptation
It is the river of no regret
There is a child that cries in the ghetto
That one child is all children
All children are that one

There is a vision that shines in the darkness
That one vision is all of our dreams
All of our dreams are that one

It is a vision of heaven
It is a child of promise
It is the song of life
It is the river of no regret

Let this be a voice for the mountains
Let this be a voice for the river
Let this be a voice for the forest
Let this be a voice for the flowers
Let this be a voice for the ocean
Let this be a voice for the desert
Let this be a voice for the children
Let this be a voice for the dreamers
Let this be a voice of no regret

[Verse]
At last, my love has come along
My lonely days are over and life is like a song
At last, the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover ever since the night I looked at you

[Chorus]
And found a dream that I could speak to
A dream that I could call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill like I have never known
When you smiled, when you smiled at me
That's how the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last

[Chorus]
I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill that I had never known
You smiled and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven, I found my love at last
Oh the evening train is rolling
All along the homeward way
All my hopes are over the horizon
All my dreams have gone away
The hillside darkly shaded
Stars fall from above
All the joys of Earth have faded
The night's untouched, my love
I'll be here 'til tomorrow
Beneath a shroud of gray
I pretend I'm free of sorrow
My heart is miles away
The dead bells are ringing
My train is overdue
To your memory I'm clinging
I can't escape from you

Well I hear the sound of thunder
Roaring loud and long
Sometimes you've got to wonder
God knows I've done no wrong
You've wasted all your power
You threw out the Christmas pie
Now you're withering like a flower
You'll play the fool and die
I'm neither sad nor sorry
I'm all dressed up in black
I fought for fame and glory
You tried to break my back
In the far off sweet forever
The sunshine peeking through
We should have walked together
I can't escape from you
I cannot grasp the shadows
That gather near the door
Rain falls round my window
I wish I'd seen you more
The path is ever winding
The stars they never age
The morning light is blinding
All the world's a stage
Should be the time of gladness
Happy faces everywhere
The mystery of madness
Is propagating in the air
I don't like the city
Not like some folks do
Isn't it a pity
I can't escape from you

We plowed the fields of heaven
Right down to the end
I hope I can be forgiven
If any words of mine offend
All our days were splendid
They were simple, they were plain
It never should have ended
I should have kissed you in the rain
I've been thinking things all over
All the moments full of grace
The primrose and the clover
Your ever changing face
Can't help looking at you
You made love with god-knows-who
Never found a gal to match you
I can't escape from you
Oh oh my baby oh

(Verse1)
I have waited for so long to hear you say
I wanna spend my whole life with you (yes i do)
Well i dont mean to fuss dont mean to push
I know your all alone
But theres just one thing i have to know

(Chorus)
Is it just infatuation?
Or is it real love? (real love?)
Is it just infatuation?
Well why dont you take me girl
And drive me in your life?

(Verse2)
I can't explain it
What you do to me
I get so excited when you call my name
Im not ashamed (ah ah)
Ashamed to let the whole world see
Oh girl just what you do to me
Well im like a child thats lost his way
So won't you help me?
(Chorus x2)
Is it just infatuation?
Or is it real love?(real love?)
Is it just infatuation?
(i need to know right now my darlin please)
Why dont you take me girl
And drown me in your love?
Come on baby i need to know right now
Tell what you think of about me baby?
Tell me what you think about me girl?
Oh oh oh i need to know right now
Come on come on my baby

(Hook)
Even if im all alone
Gurl you give me strength
I can carry on (your the special kind)
Gurl im so confused i don't know what to do
Right on right on right on
(im turnin ya love its original)
And like the rain that falls on me
Girl ya heal my soul
Girl ya set me free
(girl this is how i feel)
Well baby ya know how
Girl ya see that ya my
My love baby my sweetness
Can i talk to you
We really need to work this out
Without a doubt

Well theres no need to do me wrong
(Chrous)
Is this just infatuation?
(come on)i need to know right now(if it's real)
What the deal tell me now come on my sweetness
Written by Danny Kirwan

The way you walk - it drives me mad
Now, the way you talk - it makes me glad
Love that woman - yes, you're everything to me
Whoa, 'cause you're a friend and lover
Whoa, just as sweet as a woman should be

She knows how to work - and she knows how to play
She knows how to keep me happy - everyday
Love that woman, yes, I need you by my side
Whoa, 'cause you got a way baby
Whoa, a way that keeps me satisfied

When a no good man - tries to give her a line
She tells him quick - whoa, she's all mine
Love that woman, yes, your everything to me
Whoa, 'cause you're a friend and lover
Just as sweet as good as a woman should be

I love you baby
I love you baby
I love that woman
I love that woman
I love that woman
I love that woman
Love is lovelier the second time around
Just as wonderful with both feet on the ground
It's that second time you hear your love song sung
Makes you think perhaps that love, like youth, is wasted on the young

Love's more comfortable the second time you fall
Like a friendly home the second time you call
Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found?
There are those who'll bet love comes but once and yet
I'm oh so glad we met the second time around

Who can say what brought us to this miracle we've found
There are those who'll bet love comes but once and yet
I'm oh so glad we met the second time around
Cheer up Murray
Don't let it get you down
Pick yourself up off the ground
It's gonna be alright

Cheer up Murray
You look a little sad
Your life ain't so bad
Just think of all the good times

Remember your thirty third birthday
You threw a great big party
And all of your friends were there for you
Jemaine, Greg, and me
We brought you a cake in the shape of a four and a three
'Cause we all thought you were forty three

You got a dog
He loves you Murray
It's one hell of a dog
It's an English bulldog
And you've got a car
Don't you Murray
It's an '03 Accord
Only one previous owner
And you've got a job
You've got all of your limbs
You've got a sensitive nose
And you do Tae Kwon Do
You're good at matching your ties to your clothes
You've got a wife
Though she comes and goes

Some people don't return your calls
They don't return your calls
People will call you Gingerballs
They'll call you Gingerballs
Those people don't know what they see
They just see Gingerballs
Gingerballs

Cheer up Murray
It's time to forget
Your wife met someone on the 'net
Let's go and get an ice cream

Cheer up Murray
So nothing goes your way
It's the same every day
Well, tomorrow is another day
(?)
Wooh!!

[Verse 1]
It don’t matter what clothes you wear
It doesn’t matter how you do your hair
All that matters is you are looking strong

[Chorus]
And I dig, brother, I dig
Dig, brother, I dig

Ahhhh...

She is a strong look

[Verse 2]
It don’t matter whether you are right or wrong
It doesn’t matter any way
You did  tomorrow what you've did today

[Chorus]
And it's cool brother it's cool
Cool brother it's cool
Ohhhh (I'm talking demons(?))
It's cool brother it's cool
Cool brother it's cool
Ohhhh...

[Verse 3]
Listen shadow, the place is a mess (?)
When you're living close to the edge (yeeahhh)
Just remember that you have a brother
And I know brother I know
I know brother I know

[Outro]
Huh
Dig society, I gotta look
Dig society, we gotta look and dig it
And dig it! (huhhh)
Dig society, I gotta move
You like being alone, been proved true (?)

Take it off!
Oh!, Jesus, take off that shit
Seriously
(Kevin's laugh can be heard at the end of the song, along with someone saying something like "Ah it's pretty shit (?) that one")
If you ever been mistreated, then you know just what I'm talking about
If you ever been mistreated people, you know just what I'm talking about
I tell you I worked, I worked five long years for a woman
And she had the nerve to put me out

You know I got a job in a steel mill, trucking steel like a slave
Five long years, every Friday I went straight home with all of my pay
If you ever been mistreated people then you know just what I'm talking about
I tell you I worked, I worked five long years for a woman
And she had the nerve to put me out

But you know, I finally learned a lesson, a long, long time ago
The next woman that I marry, she gotta work and bring in the dough
If you been mistreated people then you know just what I'm talking about
I tell you I worked, I worked five long years for a woman
She had the nerve, she had the nerve to put me out
Girl you're in the kitchen
Cooking me a meal
Something makes me wanna come in there and get a feel
Walk around in your t-shirt
Nothing else on
Strutting pass, switching that ass while I'm on the phone
Cutting up tomatoes, fruits and vegetables and potatoes
Girl, you look so sexy while you're doing the damn thing
I want

Sex in the kitchen over by the stove
Put you on the counter by the buttered rolls
Hands on the table, on your tippy toes
We'll be making love like the restaurant was closed

How would you like it, baby
(How would you like that?)
Tell me right now pretty baby
(Hey man, I'm gon call you back)

Girl you're in the kitchen, chillin in your robe
I'm sayin to myself she better go put on some clothes
Tickling and teasing
Doing that little dance
Girl, you gon make me lay you down and give it to you one mo 'gain
Sex in the kitchen over by the stove
Put you on the counter by the buttered rolls
Hands on the table, on your tippy toes
We'll be making love like the restaurant was closed

Sex in the kitchen over by the stove
Put you on the counter by the buttered rolls
Hands on the table, on your tippy toes
We'll be making love like the restaurant was closed

Girl I'm ready to toss your salad
While I'm making love,girl I'll be feasting
Girl you're in the kitchen
Sweating up a storm
The oven's on 500
So you know the kitchen's warm
Girl you know just how to get into a brother's mind
Cause here we are still in this kitchen
Doing it for the third time

Sex in the kitchen over by the stove
Put you on the counter by the buttered rolls
Hands on the table, on your tippy toes
We'll be making love like the restaurant was closed
Someday at Christmas men won't be boys
Playing with bombs like kids play with toys
One warm December our hearts will see
A world where men are free
Someday at Christmas there'll be no wars
When we have learned what Christmas is for
When we have found what life's really worth
There'll be peace on earth
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmastime
Someday at Christmas we'll see a Man
No hungry children, no empty hand
One happy morning people will share
Our world where people care
Someday at Christmas there'll be no tears
All men are equal and no men have fears
One shinning moment my heart ran away
From our world today
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmastime
Someday at Christmas man will not fail
Take hope because your love will prevail
Someday a new world that we can start
With hope in every heart
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmastime
Someday at Christmastime
They say there ain't no woman that a man can trust
That they all use joo-joo, and goofy dust
But I don't argue baby
And I won't make no fuss
Cause I'm glad glad glad, I'm so glad baby
That you put it on me

Oh, I had pretty women in every town
And I played so hard when the sun went down
Oh, but you stopped my partying
You stopped my partying when you came around baby
Mmmm....and I'm so glad
I'm so glad, I'm so glad, I'm so glad baby
That you put it on me

If I hollered for help
The doctor would come
If I asked for medicine
You know he'd give me some
But that wouldn't cure me baby
Oh, and you know that wouldn't be no fun
So you just keep on, keep on mama
Oh, you just keep on puttin' it on me
Yes, just keep it up baby
Keep on puttin' it on me
Keep it up
Keep on, keep on baby...
If I steal a kiss, dear, I'll surely return it someday
If I steal your dreams, dear, I'll bring them back some way
If I steal your moonlight, I'll bring it back more divine
But if I steal your heart, dear, I'll keep it close to mine

If I steal your moonlight, I'll bring it back more divine
And if I steal your heart, dear, I'll keep it close to mine
I'll keep it close to mine
I have to come and see you
Maybe once or twice a year
I think nothing would suit me better right now
Than some downtown atmosphere
Sitting with you in some local zoo
Not another job would do
Synchronized and vital
Good friends, me and you

The sun goes down in Jersey
Rises over Little Italy
We could talk it up 'til the block gets up
Swapping stories
Kicking on down to Chinatown
Kicking 'em at the OTB
Always synchronized and vital
Good friends, you and me

No hearts of gold, no nerves of steel
No blame for what we can and cannot feel
Now it's cloak and dagger
Walk on eggshells and analyze
Every particle of difference
Gets like mountains in our eyes
So far off, so frequently
Always synchronized and vital

No hearts of gold, no nerves of steel
No blame for what we can and cannot feel

Sometimes change comes at you
Like a broadside accident
We get minor cuts and bruises
We could hammer out these dents
Sitting around in some local zoo
Watching it like a movie
Always synchronized and vital
Good friends, you and me

No hearts of gold, no nerves of steel
No blame for what we can and cannot feel

[Verse]
Now that you're gone, it's been a long, lonely time
It's a long, sad, lonely time
Rolling along, I'm in a strange state of mind
It's a strange old state of mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Memories, they mess with my mind
Who am I to deny?

[Chorus]
She was so good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So bad being in love

[Verse]
Now that you're gone, it's been a long, lonely time
It's a long, sad, lonely time
Rolling along, I'm in a strange state of mind
It's a strange old state of mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Memories, they mess with my mind
Who am I to deny?

[Chorus]
She was so good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So good at being in trouble
So bad being in love
One, two, three, four

Hollywood is everywhere, you know
You don't—ah...one more time, one more time

One, two, three, ha

Hollywood is everywhere, now don't you know
You don't have to learn the line to see the show
Just catch it when it's dark or flying low

Get along down Sunset, yes indeed
Hollywood is what you let it be
What you want is often what you need

Swing low, swing low
For none of us will ever get back home
Swing right, sleep tight
No one here ever goes home at night

Hollywood is everywhere
Graceful children walk on air
Still line up in single file
We'll go down and stare awhile
Hold on honey, tell me does she move
In her knock me down and love me shoes
All the oil she's got is for the blues

Have you ever climbed those cut glass stairs?
Trick or treat got nothing to compare
Million dollar daydreams end up there

Hollywood is everywhere, you know
Don't have to be in love to see the show
Just catch it when it's dark or flying low

Get along down Sunset, yes indeed
Hollywood is what you let it be
What you want is often what you need

Swing low, swing low
None of us will get back home
Swing right, sleep tight
No one here ever goes home at night

Hollywood is everywhere
Graceful children walk on air
Still line up in single file
We'll go down and stare awhile
Hold on honey, tell me does she move
In her knock me down and fuck me shoes
All the oil she's got is for the grooves

Have you ever climbed those cut glass stairs
Trick or treat got nothing to compare
Million dollar daydreams end up there

Stay here

I don't like them words

[Intro]
Checking out the hotties down on Cuba
Sweet Suzy Sue is playing the tuba, ye-a-ah
The fuzz is on the street, laying on the heat, ya'll
Walking on their feet y'all
The guy with the big black boom box laying down the beat, ye-ah

[Verse 1]
Reginald and Donna getting it on on the corner
Taking it higher baby
Sweet Suzy Sue is playing the lyre, lyre, my pants are on fire
Along comes CJ
Ugly as a DJ (but he's a fresh fella)
Joined by the F of the C
Singing a cappella, singing a cappella, wahahahahaha

[Verse 2]
The fly guys hanging 'round the honeys
Like flies to the honey
Donna tells Reginald that he owes her money, oh no
Then Reggie tells Donna, "Wait 'til 12 o'clock, that's when my work, that's when my dole comes through"
Sweet Suzy Sue, playing didgeridoo
Lay it on down now, Sexy Sue

[Interlude]
Along comes Michael
On his bi-cy-cle
Looking as cool as a Fisher & Paykel
Yeah, singing...

[Chorus]
"That's where you'll find me, checking out the hotties on Cuba
And that's where I wanna be, checking out the hotties down on Cuba"
F of The C, checking out the hotties down on Cuba
Singing acapella
Oh, oh, oh (laughter), oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah

Oh, oh, yeah....

[Verse 1]
All my love, all of my kissing
You don't know what you been missing

[Chorus]
Oh boy
When you're with me
Oh boy
Want the world to see
That you
Were meant
For me

[Verse 2]
All my life, I've been waiting
Tonight there'll be no hesitating

[Chorus]
Oh boy
When you're with me
Oh boy
I want the world to see
That you
Were meant
For me

[Bridge]
Stars appear and the shadow is falling
You can hear my heart calling
Little bit of loving makes everything right
I'm gonna see my baby tonight

[Verse 2 repeated]
All my life, I've been waiting
Tonight there'll be no hesitating

[Chorus]
Oh boy
When you're with me
Oh boy
I want the world to see
That you
Were meant
For me

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge]
Stars appear and the shadow's falling
You can hear my heart calling
A little bit of loving makes everything right
I wanna see my baby tonight

[Verse 2 repeated]
All my life, I've been waiting
Tonight there'll be no hesitating

[Chorus]
Oh boy
When you're with me
Oh boy
I want the world to see
That you
Were meant
For me
That you
Were meant
For me
That you
Were meant
For me
I was mighty blue
Thought my life was through
'Til the heavens opened
And I gazed at you

Won't you tell me, dear
Why, when you appear
Something happens to me
And the strangest feeling goes through me?

You do something to me
Something that simply mystifies me
Tell me, why should it be
You have the power to hypnotize me?

Let me live 'neath your spell
Do do that voodoo that you do so well
For you do something to me
That nobody else could do
I came down from Butte, Montana
For a little change of scene
And I stopped to stay in Santa Fe
Where I met a pretty queen
Hair of gold, eyes of blue
Lips like cherry wine
She's the prettiest gal I ever know and I'm gonna make her mine
Now I planned to leave on Monday
But she held me kinda tight
So I stood my ground and hung around
And then I left on Friday night
Oh, hair of gold, eyes of blue
Lips like cherry wine
The prettiest gal I ever knew and I'm gonna make her mine
Here am I, mad about you, mad about you
I can't lie, I'm mad about you, mad about you
Though I said to my heart, don't fall
How I love the enchantment of it all
If you knew all the dreams I've had about you
Then you'd know that I've got it bad about you
Press your lips to my lips and hold me near, so near
Can't you see I'm mad about you, dear

If you knew all those dreams I've had about you
Then you'd know that I've got it bad about you
Press your lips to my lips and hold me near, so near
Settle down, you, gadabout, you
Please don't make me sad about you
Can't you see I'm mad about you, dear
I never seen you
Looking so bad my funky one
You tell me that
Your superfine mind has come undone

Any major dude with half a heart
Surely will tell you my friend
Any minor world that breaks apart
Falls together again

When the demon's at your door
In the morning, it won't be there no more
Any major dude will tell you

Have you ever seen a squonk's tears?
Well, look at mine
The people on the street
Have all seen better times

Any major dude with half a heart
Surely will tell you my friend
Any minor world that breaks apart
Falls together again
When the demon's at your door
In the morning, it won't be there no more
Any major dude will tell you

I can tell you all I know
The where to go, the what to do
You can try to run but you can't hide
From what's inside of you

Any major dude with half a heart
Surely will tell you my friend
Any minor world that breaks apart
Falls together again

When the demon's at your door
In the morning, it won't be there no more
Any major dude will tell you
Frank Sinatra
Miscellaneous
The Day After Forever
This version runs only 1:47
All day tomorrow I'll be whispering your name
And the day after forever I know I'll do the same
May-time or winter I won't let you out of sight
And the day after forever we'll talk about tonight
Your laughter is a melody that I'll remember long
It plays upon my heartstrings, it's my fav'rite song
All through a lifetime I'll be loving you and then
On the day after forever I'll just begin again
I know perfectly well
I'm not where I should be
I've been very aware
You've been patient with me

Every time we break up
You bring back your love to me
And after all I've done to you
How can it be

You still believe in me

I try hard to be more
What you want me to be
But I can't help how I act
When you're not here with me

I try hard to be strong
But sometimes I fail myself
And after all I've promised you
So faithfully
You still believe in me

I wanna cry...
It's another woman
Hey, it could be me, it could be anyone
Yeah, she got the energy to blind the sun
And she make me glow
She sparkle and I see the light
I miss her every moment she is out of sight
She's a necessity
My baby keeps rolling me

Watch her glide
This girl is bonafide
She's got what causes chaos

She's got the power that I can't explain
Blowing through each other like a hurricane
Look at me, I'm twenty-seven stories high
There may be somebody else and

I don't want to live like that
No, I don't want to live like that
Don't want to live like that
No, I don't want to live like that, live like that
Just another voice in the wilderness
Stick with me forever
Cross my heart and hope to die
You should give me everything and so will I
And the world will know
I say I will not lie
You know more lovers than one for some become a necessity
My baby keeps rolling me

Live on stage
Exposing my jealous rage
Life can be complicated

I give you something you can talk about
Love is like a prison and you can't get out
These things are hard to find
You say the world is flat but

I don't want to live like that
No, I don't want to live like that
Don't want to live like that
No, I don't want to live like that, live like that
Just another voice in the wilderness

Walking through the fire
Running like a river 'til the race is won
I'm risking everything to be someone
I will stick by you
We know but we will not fail
Lifting of the spirit and the flesh prevails
And the fight is on
This love, it keeps rolling on
Watch me fly
Into the clear blue sky
This is the age of wonder
I am the one

I don't want to live like that
No, I don't want to live like that
I don't want to live like that, live like that
Just another voice in the wilderness

[Verse 1]
In the middle of the turbulence surrounding you
These trying times that are so hard to endure
In the middle of what seems to be your darkest hour
Hold fast your heart and be assured

[Chorus]
This too shall pass
Like every night that's come before it
He'll never give you more than you can bear
This too shall pass
So in this thought be comforted
It's in His Hands
This too shall pass

[Verse 2]
The Father knows the tears you cry before they fall
He feels your pain, His heart and yours are one
The Father knows that sorrow's heavy chains are strong
But with His strength, you'll overcome

[Chorus]
This too shall pass
Like every night that's come before it
He'll never give you more than you can bear
This too shall pass
So in this thought be comforted
It's in His Hands
This too shall pass

[Bridge]
So set your eyes upon the mountain
And lift your hands up to the sky
And let His arms of love surround you
And take you to the other side

[Chorus]
This too shall pass
Like every night that's come before it
He'll never give you more than you can bear
This too shall pass
So in this thought be comforted
It's in His Hands
This too shall pass
It's in His Hands
This too shall pass
I woke up this morning, my baby was gone
Woke up this morning, my baby was gone
I've been so bad, I'm all alone
I ain't got nobody stayin' home with me
I ain't got nobody stayin' home with me
My baby she's gone, I'm in misery
Well baby, I'm all alone
Yes baby, I'm all alone
I ain't had no lovin'
Since my baby's been gone
All right
Oh baby, I'm all alone
Oh baby, I'm all alone
My baby she's gone, I'm in misery
Oh baby, come on stay with me
Yes baby, come on stay with me
My baby she's gone, I'm in misery
Oh baby I'm all alone
Oh baby I'm all alone
I ain't had no lovin' since my baby been gone
In the grand way, she loves me
The way she holds me close to rest with me
And to know she is my life to me
My empty days are done
My running days are run
For the first time I love the morning

Burning sundowns, colored autumn trees
Mountain rivers, country livers put my mind at ease
And to realize such perfect harmony
Standing in the dawn
Of a new day coming on
I'm looking for no tomorrow

I can still hear the lonely sound
The engines of the midnight freight train northward bound
And to feel my life, my life slowly losing ground
I never quite understood
Though I see it for the good
It seems like I've just been dreaming
The way she holds me close to comfort me

My empty days are done
My running days are run
For the first time I love the morning
For the first time I love the morning
For the first time, the first time

[Chorus]
I'll rub your back, wash your hair
I'll do anything, I don't care
I'll cook your food, buy your clothes
To the limit I will go
I will go

[Verse 1: Nathan]
I guess you wonder where I've been
I've been thinking about the perfect way
To express my thoughts within
You mean everything to me
And I wanna be the only man
To supply your needs

[Chorus]
I'll rub your back, wash your hair
I'll do anything, I don't care
I'll cook your food, buy your clothes
To the limit I will go
I will go

[Verse 2: Shawn]
I await your precious kiss
Gets my head when they spread sweet and wet
Across my lips
I respond to every single touch
Got me open on your love
Wanna give you so much

[Chorus]
I'll rub your back, wash your hair
I'll do anything, I don't care
I'll cook your food, buy your clothes
To the limit I will go
I will go

[Outro: Mike]
Ooooh....The things I do for you
Take you out for a night on the town
And after, I'd run you some bath water
With some bubbles
Do you like bubbles
I'll dry you off
And lotion your body down
You'd like that, wouldn't you
I'll do anything you want me to
You know I don't care
You know when we're done
I could paint your toe nails for you
And I'd blow them dry
Come along and listen to the lullaby of Broadway
The hip-hooray and ballyhoo, the lullaby of Broadway
The rumble of a subway train, the rattle of the taxis
The daffodils who entertain at Angelo's and Maxie's

When a Broadway baby says goodnight, it's early in the morning
Manhattan babies don't sleep tight until the dawn
Goodnight, baby, goodnight, milkman's on his way
Sleep tight, baby, sleep tight, let's call it a day
Listen to the lullaby of Broadway
Every time I tune up this thing
I'm reminded of what it feels like to break a string
And my hand reacts like a wounded woman
And nothing hurts worse
Baby, be patient with me
Please don't get angry
If I can't stay
Oh I'd love to see you in the daylight
Before we book the chapel
Before I make you my wife
Every time I climb the riser to drum
I'm reminded of what a song writing failure I've become
And my pride reacts like a wounded woman
And nothing hurts worse
Guys, be patient with me
Please don't get angry
When I act that way
Oh I'd break some bottles and celebrate
The dreamer still in me
Is in a total ingrain
Every time I tune up this thing
I'm reminded of what it feels like to break a string
And my hand reacts like a wounded woman
And nothing hurts worse...
Hoverin' by my suitcase
Tryin' to find a warm place to spend the night
A heavy rain is falling
Seems I hear your voice calling, it's all right

A rainy night in Georgia
A rainy night in Georgia
Seems its raining all over the world
Feels like its raining all over the world

Neon lights are flashing
Taxicabs and buses passing, through the night
The distant moaning of a train
Seems to play a sad refrain, tonight

On a rainy night in Georgia
Rainy night in Georgia
Feels like it's raining all over the world
Seems its raining all over the world

How many times I wonder
But it still comes out the same
No matter how you think of it, or look at it
Its life and you just got to play the game
Find my place in the boxcar
So I take my guitar, to pass some time
Late at night when it's hard to rest
I hold your picture to my chest, and I feel fine

On this rainy night in Georgia
Rainy night in Georgia
Seems like its raining all over the world
Feel like its raining all over the world

On a rainy night in Georgia
Seems its raining all over the world
All over my world
Hmmmm hmmmm

[Verse 1]
I can't decide, I don't know (Which way to go?)
The options multiply, the choices grow (Which way to go?)
What should I buy, what should I be? (Which way to go?)
Doctor, Lawyer, Indian Chief, so much comes at you, too much for me (Which way to go?)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Elusive dreams and vague desires
Fanned to fiery needs by golden boys in ad empires
Fiction, truth, fiction, truth, fiction, truth
Fiction

[Chorus 1]
Fiction of the boob tube, fiction of the papers
Fiction of the image and the image makers
Fiction of the magazines, fiction of the movies
Fiction of the "Buy me," "Watch me," "Listen to me"

[Verse 2]
I can't decide, I'm so confused (Which way to go?)
I'm being useful here, I'm being used (Which way to go?)
Some line gets drawn, what line is this? (Which way to go?)
Could be a threshold or a precipice (Which way to go?)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Elusive dreams and vague desires
Fanned to fiery needs by sexy boys in flaming TV fires
Fiction, truth, fiction, truth, fiction, truth
Fiction

[Chorus 2]
Fiction of obedience, fiction of rebellion
Fiction of the goody-goody and the hellion
Fiction of destroyers, fiction of preservers
Fiction of peacemakers and shit disturbers

[Chorus 3]
Fiction of the moralist, fiction of the nihilist
Fiction of the innovator and the stylist
Fiction of the killjoy, fiction of the charmer
Fiction of the clay feet and the shining armour

[Chorus 4]
Fiction of the declaimers, fiction of the rebukers
Fiction of the pro and the no nukers
Fiction of the gizmo, fiction of the data
Fiction of the this is this and that is that

[Verse 3]
I can't decide, I don't know (Which way to go?)
The more you learn, the less you know (Which way to go?)
Some follow blind and never know (Which way to go?)
To lead you need some place to go (Which way to go?)

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Elusive dreams and vague desires
Fanned to fiery needs by deadly deeds in falling empires
Fiction, truth, fiction, truth, fiction, truth
Fiction

[Chorus 5]
Fiction of the diplomat, fiction of the critic
Fiction of the Pollyanna and the cynic
Fiction of the coward, fiction of the hero
Fiction of the monuments reduced to zero

Drink to me only with thine eyes
And I will pledge with mine
Or leave a kiss within the cup
And I'll not ask for wine
The thirst that from the soul doth rise
Doth ask a drink divine;
But might I of Jove's nectar sip
I would not change for thine

I sent thee late a rosy wreath
Not so much hon'ring thee
As giving it a hope that there
It could not withered be;
But thou thereon did'st only breathe
And sent'st it back to me
Since when it grows and smells, I swear
Not of itself, but thee

Drink to me only with thine eyes
And I will pledge with mine
Or leave a kiss within the cup
And I'll not ask for wine
The thirst that from the soul doth rise
Doth ask a drink divine;
But might I of Jove's nectar sip
I would not change for thine
I see trees of green, red roses too
I see them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself, "What a wonderful world"
I see skies of blue, clouds of white
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night
And I think to myself, "What a wonderful world"

The clouds of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Also on the faces of people passin' by
I see friends shakin' hands
Sayin', "How do you do?"
They are really sayin', "I love you"

I hear babies cry and I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know
And I think to myself, "What a wonderful world"

The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people goin' by
I see friends shakin' hands
Sayin', "How do you do?"
They are really sayin', "I love you"
I hear babies cry, I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know
And I think to myself, "What a wonderful world"

Oh, I think to myself, "What a wonderful world"

[Verse 1]
Well, I'm building a highway back
Back to the heart of things
No love left to walk back
Back to the heart of things
So, I'm building above and back
All our city gone red
When I get it all from you
I'm gonna get it all true, true

[Verse 2]
(One, two, three, four)
It's cold when I say goodbye
People holding a meaning, why?
But you never let the car get in
Howling on the sound of swim
Did you want a wind and a sail
It would take a boat
All of the infinitive rope
Say what you want, don't bring
Anything back to me
Cause I'm old, I will say goodbye
Hoping to run out of my lie
If I get a lot from you
I'll make it all come true

[Intro]
I, I get scared and it comes
But I know I'm gonna be alright
I get scared when it comes
And I know I'm gonna be alright

[Hook]
I, I get scared, I get scared, when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright
I, I get scared when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright

[Verse]
Y'all don't know things I know
Where I've been and where I go
Y'all don't know cause y'all can't see
Look, you do you let me be me
Y'all don't know the pain I felt
How I played the cards I was dealt
Y'all don't know what you're talking about
Y'all need to stop running your mouth

[Hook]
I, I get scared, I get scared, when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright
I, I get scared when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright

[Verse]
I get down for real I know it your way
Sunday to Sunday when the game is gunplay
Remember that one day, I'm gonna get it
'Til I get it, all I get
We can get to them and the fat bitch cooking
Like a nosey this Snooki
Been at the age hunting, since the age 11
I think you on stage, you fronting
Look here
I'm that nigga and I knock on your door
You look into my eyes you be like "dog, what's wrong?"
You feel it like I feel it, there's something in the air
Wait come here, yeah it's coming from right there

[Hook]
I, I get scared, I get scared, when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright
I, I get scared when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright

[Hook]
I, I get scared when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright
I get scared when you're gone
And I'm gonna be alright
I'm gonna be alright

[Hook]
I, I get scared, I get scared, when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright
I, I get scared when you're gone
But I know I'm gonna be alright

[Verse]
You would never let me real so I always hate
Make a nigga take it back from where it all began
Even be real, ye it's that bad
Let me get to sippin' ye we're not that
Whenever you gonna do there's no concentration
Shit there's something on my cock take of your face
And you was in the wrong place at the wrong time
I'm taking everything you got I want all mine
How you gon' stop me when I don't stop for signs
Hey you got mine, I'm gon' start lying
But instead a nigga tryin' don't stop it from happening
I guess they won't get it 'til they stop clapping
Ah, he can buy her diamonds, he can buy her pearls
He can send her on a trip, all around this world
He can buy her anything her little heart desires
But he don't know how to set that little girl's soul on fire

Even though he drives a big fine Cadillac car
And he keeps her dressed up (ah!) like a movie star
Anything she asks of him, his money can buy
But when it comes down to love, she gives me a try!

No man can love her like I do

Tell the truth, no man can love her like I do
No man can love her like I do
Even though I don't have one thin dime
Everytime I call her, you know she's right on time

No man can love her like I do

Ain't no man in this land who can love her like I do!
No man can love her like I do!
Hold Me Tight
I've waited all my life for you
Hold me tight
Take care of me and I'll be right
Hold me tight hold me tight
Hold me tight hugga me right
Hold me tight squeeza me tight
Hold me tight hugga me right
Hold me tight hold me tight
Hold me tight
You won't be going out tonight / candlelight
Make love to me and make it right
Hold me tight hold me tight
Hold me tight
Hold me tight hug me right
Hold me tight
Hold me tight hug me right
Hold me tight
Hold me tight hold me tight
Hold me tight hug me right
Hold me tight squeeza me tight
Hold me tight hugga me right
Hold me tight
Hold me tight
Lazy Dynamite

Oh will you fight that feeling in your heart
Don't you know that inside
There's a love you can't hide
So why do you fight that feeling in your heart
Oh lazy dynamite
Oh lazy dynamite
Oh lazy dynamite
Oh lazy dynamite
Oh why do you fight that feeling in your heart
Don't you know that inside

Doo doo doo 
Hands of Love
I can't get over myself
Falling into the hands of love
Just can't imagine myself
Falling head over heals in love
But when I saw you last night
I knew for the first time
That you were the one I'd been dreaming of
I can't get over myself
Falling into the hands of love
Falling into the hands of love
But when I saw you last night
I knew for the first time
That you were the one I'd been dreaming of
I can't get over myself
Falling into the hands of love
Falling into the hands of love
Love sweet love
But when I saw you last night
I knew for the first time
That you were the one I'd been dreaming of
I can't get over myself
Falling into the hands of love
Falling into the hands of love
Love sweet love
Power Cut
There may be a powercut
And the candles burn down low
But something inside of me
Says the bad news isn't so
I may never tell you
But baby you should know
There may be a miracle
And baby I love you so
Baby I love you so
Baby I love you so
Baby I love you so
Baby I love you so
Baby I love you so
I may never tell you
But baby you should know
There may be a miracle
And baby I love you so
Baby I love you so
Baby I love you so
Baby I love you so
Baby I love you so
Baby I love you so
Baby I love you so

Non-stop, no pause in this

One caution Miss, when you come up in here flossin' Miss
Little stiletto heels, you gonna be tossin' Miss
Got lips like Rosario Dawson, Miss
Come here, give the boss a kiss
If your man gotta ask, "what's the cause of this?"
Probably can't properly sauce your wrist
If he lost your wrist, really shouldn't toss a fist
Ever since 'Ali' it's an automatic loss in this
I must insist, blindly you trust in this

As we rode out to Fennario
As we rode out to Fennario
Our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove
And her called her by a name, pretty Peggy-O

Will you marry me, pretty Peggy-O?
Will you marry me, pretty Peggy-O?
If you will marry me, I'll set your cities free
And free all the ladies in the area-O

I would marry you, sweet William-O
I would marry you, sweet William-O
I would marry you but your guineas are too few
And I fear my mama would be angry-O

What would your mama think, pretty Peggy-O?
What would your mama think, pretty Peggy-O?
What would your mama think if she hears my guineas clink?
Saw me marching at the head of my soldiers-O

[Instrumental break]
If ever I return, pretty Peggy-O
If ever I return, pretty Peggy-O
If ever I return, your cities I will burn
Destroy all the ladies in the area-O

Come steppin' down the stairs, pretty Peggy-O
Come steppin' down the stairs, pretty Peggy-O
Come steppin' down the stairs, combin' back your yellow hair
Bid a last farewell to your William-O

Sweet William, he is dead, pretty Peggy-O
Sweet William, he is dead, pretty Peggy-O
Sweet William, he is dead, and he died for a maid
And he's buried in the Louisiana country-O

As we rode out to Fennario
As we rode out to Fennario
Our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove
And he called her by a name, pretty Peggy-O

[Verse 1]
The television's on and I'm walking through the yard
The house is fast asleep and I'm crying in my car
Dying for the weekend

[Verse 2]
The kids are alright but they don't smile much
They sit up in their garage with their decks and their stuff
Dying for the weekend

[Verse 3]
The boy's on a charge but his mother doesn't know
I never got around yet to telling her so
It would only make her crazy

[Chorus]
And I'll be fine
I'm only sleeping in my head
And I can fly
I close my eyes and I can fly

[Verse 4]
The television's on and I'm walking through the yard
The house is fast asleep and I'm crying in my car
Dying for the weekend

[Verse 5]
The kids have got a gig in an all night rave
They're lookin' pretty tough but I still want to say
Do you really have to go?

[Verse 6]
Down in the back street a skinny kid cries
Bad drive Saturday another life flies
Dying for the weekend

[Chorus]
And I'll be fine
I'm only sleeping in my head
And I can fly
I close my eyes and I can fly
And I can fly
And fall toward the end
And I can fly
And I'll be fine
I'm only sleeping in my head
And I can fly
I close my eyes and I can fly
When the evening, the evening sun goes down
You gonna find me somewhere hanging around
The night life, people, it ain't no good life
But it's my life, yeah
All the people just like you and me
Everybody's dreaming
Dreaming about their old used to be
The night life, hey, it ain't no good life, people
Oh but it's my life
Yes listen to the blues, people
Listen to what they're saying
Yes listen to the blues, people
Listen to the way they're playing
Heaven please send to all mankind
Understanding and peace of mind
If it's not asking too much
Please send me someone to love, someone to love
Show the world, show them how to get along
Peace will enter when hate is gone
If it's not asking too much
Please send me someone to love
Please send me someone to love
Nights I lay awake and ponder world's troubles
And my answer is always the same
Unless man put an end to this damnable sin
Hate will put the world in a flame, what a shame
Just because I'm, because I'm in misery
Oh I don't beg, I don't beg for no sympathy
But if it's not asking too much
Please send me someone to love, yeah
Oh the night life, people it ain't no good life
But it's my life, yeah
So please, please, please, please, please, please
Please send me someone to love
Someone to love
Yeah my baby sometimes, sometimes she will and sometimes she won't
Yes I've got a sometimey baby
Sometimes she will and sometimes she won't
And when I think about my baby loving me
Sometimes she do and sometimes she don't

Yes sometimes she's sweet like an angel
And sometimes she's the devil like a witch
Yes I said my baby's sweet
Sometimes like an angel
And sometimes she's the devil like a witch
Well to be in love with a woman like this
Sometimes you don't know which is witch

I think I'll leave in the morning
But I got to spend the night
I think I'll leave in the morning
But I got to spend the night
Yeah you may be right in your thinking people
But I know my baby's gonna make everything all right
By the beautiful sea, you'll see a girl and a fella
By the beautiful sea, you'll see a yellow umbrella

That's where we'll spoon on the sand
And then pretty soon, hand in hand
We walk through the waves, right up to our chins
We dream happy flounders of flapping our fins

When you're in love, the seaweed smells just like roses
Each breaker we strike is like a velvet settee
By evening, the moon will be high
And stardust will hit me kerplunk in the eye

It's peachy when her and me can be
By the beautiful, beautiful sea

By the beautiful sea, you'll see a girl and a fella
By the beautiful sea, you'll see a yellow umbrella

And that's where we'll spoon on the sand
And then pretty soon, hand in hand
We walk through the waves, right up to our chins
We dream happy flounders of flapping our fins
When you're in love, the seaweed smells just like roses
Each breaker we strike is like a velvet settee
By evening, the moon will be high
And stardust will hit me kerplunk in the eye

It's peachy when her and me can be
By the beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful sea
(Beautiful, beautiful sea)

For your sparkling cocky smile I've walked a million miles
Begging you to come and wed me in the spring
Why do you my dear delay
What makes you laugh and turn away
You're a hesitating beauty, Nora Lee
Well I know that you are itching to get married, Nora Lee
And I know how I'm twitching for the same thing, Nora Lee
By the stars and clouds above we could spend our lives in love
You're a hesitating beauty, Nora Lee
We can build a house and home where the flowers come to bloom
Around our yard I'll nail a fence so high
That the boys with peeping eyes cannot see that angel face
My hesitating beauty Nora Lee
Well I know that you are itching to get married Nora Lee
And I know how I'm twitching for the same thing Nora Lee
By the stars and clouds above we can spend our lives in love
If you quit your hesitating, Nora Lee
We can ramble hand in hand across the grasses of our land
I'll kiss you for each leaf on every tree
We can bring our kids to play where the dry leaves blow today
If you quit your hesitating, Nora Lee
Well I know that you are itching to get married, Nora Lee
And I know how I'm twitching for the same thing, Nora Lee
By the stars and clouds above we could spend our lives in love
If you quit your hesitating, Nora Lee
It's my carnival, it's a lovely day
Well, it's my carnival, it's a lovely day
Well, all you people getting ready to play
I want to hear you say, come on down
This is my carnival, it's a lovely day
It's my carnival, it's a lovely day
This is my carnival, it's a lovely day
All you people getting ready to play
I wanna hear you say, come on down
It's my carnival, it's a lovely day
It's my carnival, it's a lovely day
This is my carnival, it's a lovely day
All you people getting ready to play
I wanna hear you say, come down
This is my carnival, it's a lovely day
It's is my carnival, it's a lovely day
It's is my carnival, it's a lovely day
All you people getting ready to play

My carnival, it's a lovely day
It's is my carnival, it's a lovely day
All you people getting ready to play
I wanna hear you say, come down
This is my carnival, it's a lovely day
You, you got a sexy way about you baby, you
You, you get so hard I don't know what to do

You
You

You, you drive my girls to rape you now, you
You, all the girls they go ape over you (Yeah!)

You
You

You!

You, if I should die it'd be because of you
It's true, I'd kill myself if I didn't make-up to you (Yeah!)

You
You
(Yeah!)

[The first verse is inaudible]
One man's loss always is another man's gain

Let's take a cherry, I can't make it no more
Can't stop, she's breaking all time on the floor
Better come down easy or don't come down at all
You don't try and to please me, somebody's gonna fall
One man's loss always is another man's gain
Yes, one man's joy always is another man's pain

Eight o'clock in the morning, better step aside
Let me be to your warning, you better go by
Three times a loser, number 45
Better not lose her, best stayed alive
One man's loss always is another man's gain
Yes, one man's joy always is another man's pain

Wish I'd have found me (??) at the wall
One look at the watch, you better lord at all
You can't stop it or wait it (??) at night
Too hard to keep you waiting, calls me aside
One man's loss always is another man's gain
Yes, one man's joy always is another man's pain
I once knew all the answers, I stood on certain ground
A picture of true happiness, confidence so effortless
No brighter could be found

I never asked the questions that trouble me today
I knew all there was to know, love worn lightly, put on show
A conquest on display

And who would have thought his love could be so good
Not me, not me
My secrets and my passions understood
Not me, not me

Who would have guessed he'd throw his world away
To be with someone till his dying day
Not me, not me

I shall not envy lovers, but long for what they share
An empty room is merciless, don't be surprised if I confess
I need some comfort there
And who would have thought his love could be so good
Not me, not me
My secrets and my passions understood
Not me, not me

Who would have guessed he'd throw his world away
To be with someone till his dying day
Not me, not me

But not me, oh not me

[Verse 1: Nathan Morris]
I don't think I know the definition of love
'Cause what you're saying isn't what I'm thinkin' of
You say you want a good man and shit
But when you got one you don't know how to handle it
Bitter sister's what you've become
Was tryin' to be the mister to make you come to your senses
Thought you wanted to be happy
That's the main reason why you got at me

[Pre-Chorus: Shawn Stockman]
'Cause you know that I'm an earner
Legal dough, not a crook with a burner
You can't understand the kind of love I give
You never got over your last relationship (Nope)
I showed how you should be done
(Before me) Niggas use to smash and run
You ain't tryin', stop lyin'
You never cared, and I don't even know why I'm here

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
You don't love me
I took you outta the club to livin' lavishly
You don't love me
How could you ever take advantage of me
You don't love me
Everything you are, girl, I made you
You don't love me
You never loved me, loved me

[Verse 2: Wanya Morris]
Your old dude used to hold you down and beat ya
I was trying to hold you down and treat ya
To shopping sprees, jewels, cars, and cruises
All this without the scars and bruises
With him all you show is signs of meekness
May have took my kindness for weakness
Bossin' up because I don't lay hands
But that don't make me less of a man
Be easy, you're being disrespectful
Don't get it twisted, I will check you
Why are chicks in check when dudes treat 'em like shit
And good dudes get no love?

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
You don't love me
You're gonna miss me, girl, when I'm gone
(You're gonna miss me)
You don't love me (Ooh ooh)
Gonna remember what you did wrong
You don't love me
Never gonna find nobody like me
(Never, oh)
You don't love me (Never)
You never loved me (Oh oh oh)

[Bridge: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
If you really loved me, girl, it would show
But you've been flippin' on me, now you gotta go
Don't let nothing that I bought you walk out the door
'Cause I don't want you no more
I don't want you no more
(You don't love me)

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
You don't love me
I took you outta the club to livin' lavishly
You don't love me
How could you ever take advantage of me
You don't love me
Everything you are, girl, I made you
You don't love me
Never loved me
You don't love me
You're gonna miss me, girl, when I'm gone
You don't love me
Gonna remember what you did wrong
You don't love me
Never gonna find nobody like me
Oh, oh, you don't love me
You don't love me, love me

[Outro: Shawn Stockman]
You're gonna miss me, girl, when I'm gone
Yeah, yeah
Gonna remember what you did wrong, yeah

[Verse 1]
They're selling postcards of the hanging
They're painting the passports brown
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors
The circus is in town
Here comes the blind commissioner
They've got him in a trance
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker
The other is in his pants
And the riot squad they're restless
They need somewhere to go
As Lady and I look out tonight
From Desolation Row

[Verse 2]
Now Cinderella, she seems so easy
"It takes one to know one," she smiles
And puts her hands in her back pockets
Bette Davis style
And in walks Romeo, he's moaning
"You belong to me I believe"
And someone says, "You're in the wrong place, my friend
You Better leave"
And the only sound you can hear
After the ambulances go
Is Cinderella sweeping up
On Desolation Row

[Verse 3]
Now Ophelia, she's 'neath the window
For her I feel so afraid
On her twenty-second birthday, she already is an old maid
To her, death is quite romantic, she wears an iron vest
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness
And though her gaze is gazed upon Noah's great rainbow
She spend her time peeking in from
Desolation Row

[Verse 4]
Now, Einstein disguised as Robin Hood with his memories in a trunk
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk
He looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette
As he went off sniffing drainpipes and reciting the alphabet
Oh, you would not think to look at him but he was famous long ago
For playing the electric violin
On Desolation Row

[Verse 5]
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup
But all his sexless patients they're trying to blow it up
Now his nurse, some local loser she's in charge of the cyanide hole
And she also keeps the cards that read "Have mercy on his soul"
They all play on the penny whistles, yes, you can hear then blow
If you lean your head out far enough from
Desolation Row

[Instrumental]

[Verse 6]
Across the street they've nailed the curtains
They're getting ready for the feast
The Phantom of the Opera
In a perfect image of a priest
Now they're spoon-feeding Casanova
To get him to feel more assured
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence
After poisoning him with words
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls
"Get outta here if you don't know"
Casanova is just being punished for going to
Desolation Row

[Verse 7]
Now, at midnight all the agents
And the superhuman crew
They'll round up everyone
That knows more than they do
They take them to the factory
Where the heart-attack machine
Is strapped across their shoulders
And then the kerosene
Is brought down from the castles
By insurance men who go
Make sure nobody is escaping
To Desolation Row

[Verse 8]
Bob praise be to Nero's Neptune
The Titanic sails at dawn
Everybody's shouting
"Which side are you on?"
And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot
They're fighting in the captain's tower
While calypso singers laugh at them, yes
And fishermen hold flowers
Between the windows of the sea
Where lovely mermaids flow
And no one has to think too much about
Desolation Row

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 9]
Yes, I received your letter yesterday
About the time the door knob broke
When you asked how I was doing
Was that some kind of joke?
All these people that you mention
Yes, I know them, they're quite lame
I had to rearrange their faces
And give them all another name
Right now I can't read so good
Don't send me no more letters, no
Not unless you mail them from
Desolation Row
Oh, I love the changing seasons
Green and growing all around
Smiling faces laughing children
Making such a joyful sound

In my dreams I see tomorrow
Time and children of my own
Someone who will stand beside me
Helping me to make ourselves a home

If your eyes can see tomorrow
Though it might seem far away
If you have some dreams to build on
May we help you today
What a friend we have in time
Gives us children, makes us wine
Tells us what to take or leave behind

And the gifts of growing old
Are the stories to be told
Of the feelings more precious than gold

Friends I will remember you, think of you
Pray for you
And when another day is through
I'll still be friends with you

Babies days are never long
Mother's laugh is baby's song
Gives us all the hope to carry on
Friends I will remember you, think of you
Pray for you
And when another day is through
I'll still be friends with you
Friends I will remember you
Think of you, pray for you
And when another day is through
I'll still be Friends with You

Friends I will remember you
Think of you, pray for you
And when another day is through
I'll still be Friends with You
Take off your dress, put on a new one
I'm going to take you out tonight
Put on a dress, make it blue one
Ev'rything's gonna be all right
I want home again

I want home again
So I can be with you, with you
I want home again
To do the things you do, you do, yeah

I'm going to take you out tonight
Put on a dress, make it a blue one
Ev'rything's gonna be all right

I want home

So I can be with you, with you

To do the things you do, you do yeah

Thinking about Sarah
That's heaven to me
You don't know my girl
But she's right as right can be

It's like yonder mockingbird
In the cottonwood tree
You don't change that, no
It's meant to be

And that's the soul of a southern girl
Gonna set you free

When we go walking
On a summer's eve
We take the long way home
That's guaranteed

Thinking about Sarah
That's heaven to me
Thinking about my Sarah girl
She is love to me
Sitting there by her window
Sunshine in her hair
Sun can't help but love her
In fact I think he's jealous of her
Because he's just passing through
And she is ever Sarah

And that's the soul of a southern girl
Gonna set you free

Sure as that river
Is gonna run to the sea
Sure as the sun's gonna shine
She's thre for me

Thinking about Sarah
That's heaven to me
Thinking about my Sarah girl
She is love she is love

Like those lazy willows
Playong in the summer breeze
She's got that that easy rhythm
Swinging right along with them
But they're just melodies
In the symphony called Sarah
She sets me free
And that's the soul of
My southern girl
And she sets me free

Give your dog a bone
This old man came rolling home

[Verse 1]
Aurora Borealis, me for her for real
It’s lust, the love can’t be heard above
Everyone acts like a day drinker, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
We eat crickets in the future
Just tastes like “Far-from-home”
Drink chicha in the jungle
That sounds great
I'm kinda busy, could you call back again?
I'm sure you'll come back, till then

[Chorus]
I can’t keep checking my phone, no
I can’t keep checking my phone, no
I can’t keep checking my phone, no
I can’t keep checking my phone

[Verse 2]
We read the universe might be holographic
Traffic lights might reverse my love
Go ahead and traverse the winter, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
We eat crickets in the future
Just tastes like “Far-from-home”
Drink chicha in the jungle
That sounds great
I'm kinda busy, could you call back again?
I'm sure you'll come back, till then

[Chorus]
I can’t keep checking my phone, no
I can’t keep checking my phone, no
I can’t keep checking my phone, no
I can’t keep checking my phone
I got to say it and it's hard for me
You got me crying like I thought I would never be
Love is believing but you let me down
How can I love you when you ain't around
And I

Get to the morning and you never call
Love should be everything or not at all
And it don't matter whatever you do
I made a life out of loving you

Only to find any dream that I follow is dying
I'm crying in the rain
I could be searching my world for a love everlasting
Feeling no pain
When will we meet again

Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
Is it a lesson that I never knew?
Gotta get out of the spell that I'm under
My love for you
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
When I was being what you want me to be?
Suddenly everything I ever wanted has passed me by
This world may end
Not you and I

My love is stronger than the universe
My soul is crying for you
And that cannot be reversed
You made the rules and you could not see
You made a life out of hurting me

Out of my mind
I am held by the power of you love
Tell me when do we try
Or should we say goodbye?

Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
When I was being what you want me to be?
Suddenly everything I ever wanted has passed me by

Oh
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker
Is it a lesson that I never knew?
Suddenly everything I ever wanted
My love for you, ooh
Why do you have to be a heartbreaker

[Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah... yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah] (x3)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah... yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey

Well, my head's in misery
My heart's in a sling
I'm a walking Doctor Bill
People, my whole life is full of pain
Yes, I need my baby
People, I ain't signifyin'
Well, you know if I don't hurry up and find her
I believe I'm gonna lose my mind

Well, I walked my bedroom floor
Hung down my head and cried
I didn't exactly have the blues
I just want satisfied
Yes, I need my baby
People, I ain't signifyin'
Well, you know if I don't hurry up and find her
I believe I'm gonna lose my mind

Well, I can't sleep sound at night
I just cat-nap through the day
I can't hold out much lounger
People, livin' this-a-way, yeah!
Yes, I need my baby
People, I ain't signifyin'
Well, you know if I don't hurry up and find her
I believe I'm gonna lose my mind
I'm gonna leave here walkin' buddy
With my clothes in my hand
I got to find my big-legged woman
Before she gets her another man, yes!
Yes, I need my baby
People, I ain't signifyin'
Well, you know if I don't hurry up and find her
I believe I'm gonna lose my mind

She's a fine lookin' woman
Her shape is a dream
She's the lovin'-est female
People, I've ever seen, yes!
Yes, I need my baby
People, I ain't signifyin'
Well, you know if I don't hurry up and find her
I believe I'm gonna lose my mind

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time tryna get high
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try?
You need to git up, git out and git something
'Cause you and I got to do for you and I

[Verse 1: Cee-Lo]
I don't recall, ever graduating at all
Sometimes I feel I'm just a disappointment to y'all
Every day I just lay around then I can't be found
Always asking "Gimme some," living life like a bum
Times is rough, my auntie got enough problems of her own
Rollo, you supposed to be grown
I agree, I try to be the man I'm 'posed to be
But negativity is all you seem to ever see
I admit, I've done some dumb sh..., and I'm probably gon' do some mo'
You shouldn't hold that against me though
(Why not?) Why not? My music's all that I got
But some time must be invested for this to be manifested
I know you know but I'm gon' say this to you, I
Get high but I don't get too high
So what's the limit 'posed to be?
That must be why you can't get yourself up out the bed before three
You need to git up, git out, cut that bull out
Ain't you sick and tired of having to do without?
Damn, what up with all these questions?
You act as though you know something I don't, do you have any suggestions?
'Cause every job I get is cruel and demeaning
Sick of taking trash out and toilet bowl cleaning
But I'm also sick and tired of struggling
I never ever thought I'd to have resort to drug smuggling
Naw, that ain't what I'm about
Cee-Lo will just continue traveling his route
Without any doubt or fear
I know the Lord ain't brought me this far so he could drop me off here
Did I make myself clear?

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
You got to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time tryna get high
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try?
You need to git up, git out and git something
'Cause you and I got to do for you and I
That's why

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Well, uh, get up, stand up, so what's said, you pinhead?
See, when I was a youngster, used to wear them country Pro Keds
My mama made me do it but the devil, he made me smart
Told me to jack them weak suckers for they hooded Starters
In the middle school, I was a bigger fool
I wore with tank tops to show off my tattoo, thought I was cool
I used to hang out with my daddy's brothers, I call them my uncles
They taught me (They taught me), I followed them when they ran numbers
So in a sense, I was Rosemary's baby
And then I learned the difference between a trick and a lady
Hell, I treat 'em all like those, see I pimped 'em
Witch never had my money so I never whipped 'em
See, all the playas came and all the playas went
A playa ain't a gangsta but a playa can handle his business
You need to git up, git out, git something
Smoke out cause it's all about money, money, money
Yeah I said it, a nigga sporting plaits and a Braves hat
I hang with Rico Wade 'cause the Dungeon is where the funk's at, boy
I'm true to Organized cause they raised me
I'm also down with LaFace 'cause L.A. Reid, yeah, he pays me
And it's cool, yeah, it's real cool getting paid fat pockets
And all that other fat stuff like that, yeah

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
You got to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time tryna get high
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try?
You need to git up, git out and git something
'Cause you and I got to do for you and I
That's why

[Verse 3: Big Gipp]
A lot of people in my past tried to do me, screw me
Throw me over in the fire, let me get chunky and charred
Like a piece of wood and them spirits got the mutant's mind
I'm getting paranoid and steady looking for the time
It's eight in the morning and ain't nobody up yet
I got my long johns, get my coat and throw on my ball cap
I'm headed out the door, to get off in my ride
I'm digging through the ashtray, hoping to have a good day
I had Jamaica's best and when I light it up, I hear a voice in my head
(You got to git up, git out and git something)
Now I know it's on, my day is finally started
Back up in my crib, eat my grits, break out quick, in my slick
'84 Sedan DeVille, steady bouncing
Out the Point to Campbellton Road
The valley of the Southside flow
Everybody know about that killa that we call blow, so
Keep your eyes peeled for the COBRA unit
'Cause they known for jumping out of black Chevy trucks and through the fog
Here come the Red Dogs, I'm busting out around the corner in my hog
Dipping from the area, I'm scared
So one of these -itches might wind up dead, 'cause I have no time for jail
Buck Clampett cops, buck Elgin Bell
And crooked face Campbell, got the whole country
Thinking that my city is the big lick for '96
'94, Big Gipp, Goodie Mo'
OutKast, a vision from the past
Hootie Hoo!
My White Owls are burning kind of slow

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
You got to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time tryna get high
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try?
You need to git up, git out and git something
'Cause you and I got to do for you and I
That's why

[Verse 4: André 3000]
Y'all telling me that I need to get out and vote, huh, why?
Ain't nobody Black running but crac-kers
So, why I got to register?
I thinking of better stuff to do with my time
Never smelled aroma of diploma, but I write the deep-est rhymes
So let me take y'all way
Back to when Benjamin stayed in Southwest Atlanta, ayy
Y'all could not tell me nothing, thought I hit that bottom rock
At age thirteen, start working at the loading dock
They laying my mama off of work, General Motors trippin'
But I come home banked like Hank, from licking and dipping
Doing dumb thangs, not knowing what I know now
Yeah, that petty stuff will have you cased up and locked down
I dips, over to East Point still actin' a fool
Wasting my time in the school, I'd rather be shooting pool
Cool is how I played the tenth grade
I thought it was all about mackin' girls and wearing pimp fade
Instead of being in class, I'd rather be up in some (In some)
Not thinking about them six courses that I need to pass
Graduation rolled around like rolly-pollies
Damn, that's messed up, I should've listened when my mama told me
That, if you play now, you're gonna suffer later
Figured she was talking yang yang so I paid her no attention
And kept missing the point she tried to poke me with
The doper that I get, the more I'm feeling broke as chits
Huh, but that don't matter though, I am an O-U-T-Kast
So get up off your ass

[Chorus: Cee-Lo]
You got to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time tryna get high
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try?
You need to git up, git out and git something
'Cause you and I got to do for you and I
That's why

[Outro: Cee-Lo]
You need to...
You need to...
You need to...

[Intro]
Well, yeah, oh

[Verse 1]
What do you do when you love somebody
And everything is goin' wrong? Oh, no
Nobody knows the way you feel about it
'Cause only you know, you can't leave it alone

[Chorus]
Oh, here we go again
Oh, here we go again
I thought what we had was over
Here we go again, ooh, hoo
Oh, here we go again

[Verse 2]
What do you do when you love somebody
And you decide to go it alone? Ah, no, no
It never pays to give up on someone
When on the inside the feelin' is strong

[Chorus]
Oh, here we go again
Oh, here we go again
I thought what we had was over now
(Here we go again) Ooh baby
Oh, here we go again, ah

[Refrain]
After all we've been through, baby, yeah
I keep comin' back to you now
Out of all the women in the world
I keep comin' back to you, yeah, baby

[Verse 3]
What do you do when you love somebody
And realize you're walkin' away? Oh, no, no
You hesitate when it's time for leavin'
You and I know it's never too late

[Chorus]
Oh, here we go again
Here we go again
Don't ever say it's over now
(Here we go again) Ooh, baby
Here we go again, oh

[Refrain]
After all we've been through, baby, well
I keep comin' back to you now
Out of all the sweet women of the world
I keep comin' back to you, yeah, baby

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Oh, after all we've been through, baby, yeah
I keep comin' back to you now
Out of all the women in the world
I keep comin' back to you, yeah, baby
(singer)
(And he never lies)......
(And he never lies)......
Uh.....yea

(Verse 1)
He just sits, and watches the people in the boxes
Everything he sees he absorbs and adopts it
He mimics and he mocks it
Really hates the box, but he can't remember how to stop it
Uh! So he continues to watch it
Open that and then give him something that he can box with
Or how to locksmith
See the box is, locked in a box, ain't got the combination to unlock it
Thats why he wa-tches, scared to look away
Cause at that moment, it might show him
What to take off the locks with
So he chained hisself to the box, took a lock, and then he locked it
Swallowed the combination and then forgot it
As the doctors jot it all down with they pens and pencils
The same ones that took away his voice
And just left his Instrumental like that
(Hook)
(And he never lies) He never lies, he never lies, uh
(And he never lies) He never lies, he never lies, no
(And he never lies) He never lies.......
(Cause he never said anything at all)

(Verse 2)
He just sits, and listens to the people in the boxes
Everything he hears, he absorbs and adopts it
Anything not coming out the box, he blocks it
See he loves the box and hope they never stop it
Anything the box tell him to do
He does it anything it tell him to get
He shops and he cops it
He protects the box, locks it inna box when he goes to sleep, but he never sleeps
Cause he stays up to watch it
Scared to look away
Cause at that moment, it might get stolen and thats the last of the boxes
So he chained hisself to the box, took a lock, and then he locked it
Swallowed the combination and forgot it
As the doctors jot it all down with they pens and pencils
The same ones that took away his voice
And just left his Instrumental like that

(Hook)
(Bridge)x2
And you can't tell me just who you are?
You buy new clothes just to hide those scars
You built that roof just to hide those stars
Now you can't take it back to the start

(Hook)

(Bridge) fades.....
(Child child) child father of the man (father of the man, father of the man)
(Child child) child father of the man (father of the man, father of the man)
(Child child) child father of the man (father of the man, father of the man)
(Child child) child father of the man (father of the man)

(Child child) child father of the man (father of the man, father of the man)
(Child child) child father of the man (father of the man, father of the man)
(Child child) child father of the man (father of the man, father of the man)

[Verse 1]
Went out last night just to take a little round
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down
I ran right home and I went to bed
With a .44 smokeless under my head

[Verse 2]
I began to think what a deed I done
I grabbed my head and I began to run
I made a good run but I run too slow
They overtook me down in Jericho

[Verse 3]
Standin’ on the corner as he's ringin' my bell
Up stepped the sheriff of Thomasville
He says, "Young man is your name Brown?
Remember you blowed little Sadie down?"

[Verse 4]
"Oh, yes sir my name is Lee
I murdered little Sadie in first degree"
"First degree and second degree
If you got any papers, will you serve them to me."

[Verse 5]
Well they took me downtown and they dressed me in black
They put me on a train and they sent me back
I had no one for to go my bail
They crammed me back into the county jail
Oh yes they did

[Verse 6]
Now the judge and the jury they took their stand
The judge had the papers in his right hand
Forty-one days, forty-one nights
Forty-one years with the ball and stripes, oh no

[Verse 7]
Went out last night to take a little round
I met my little Sadie and I blowed her down
I run right home and I went to bed
A .44 smokeless under my head
Oh, I see those hidden tears
And I know each time your heart bleeds
Your desires have not been ignored
Ye of little faith you must believe

That I came to give you life
And a life more abundantly
Seek ye first the things which are of God
Ye of little faith you must believe

You must know I love you so
So much more than you will ever, ever know
For my promises, my promises, promises are true
And everything I say, I can do

I will do I will do I will do
I can do I can do I can do
Yeah

Oh I see those hidden tears
Y se cada vez que sangra su corazón
Your desires have not been ignored
Ustedes los de poca fe beben creer
That I came to give you life
Y viven más abundante
Seek ye first the things which are of God
Ustedes los de poca fe beben creer

Ye of little faith you must believe
Ustedes los de poca fe beben creer

You must believe that I can do all things
I can do all things because
I am God, I am Light
I am God, I am Jah

I know what to do when to do how to do
Why you need me to do what you want me to do, I know
I just need you to believe, I just need you to believe
Beben creer, beben creer, beben creer, beben creer
You need to believe, you need to believe

'Cause I can do all things to help you
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Took my love and I took it down
I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills
Well, the landslide brought me down
Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can a child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?
Well, I've been afraid of changin'
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes bolder children get older
I'm getting older too, well
Well, I've been afraid of changin'
'Cause I've built my life around you
But time makes bolder children get older
I'm getting older too, well, I'm getting older too
So take this love and take it down
Yeah and if you climb a mountain and you turn around
And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
Well, the landslide brought down
And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
Well, maybe, well, maybe, well, maybe
The landslide'll bring you down
I took two shots, got no ducks, and cold, cold hands

Last night while I was out drinking
Trying to have a good time
The lady with whom I was speaking
Thought I was feeding her some old line

When I spoke of a cold winter's morning
A duck blind and a river of gray
The sound of the snow softly falling
When I thought I heard somebody say

I took two shots, got no ducks, and cold, cold hands

I could tell by the gaze of my comrades
That I was the one who had spoke
Their eyes held a message of patience
The thrill of the hunt and of hope

But when I spoke again how they listened
For the wisdom of what I might say
If the good Lord had meant us to shoot one
He'd surely send more ducks our way
I took two shots, got no ducks, and cold, cold hands

Well the lady with whom I was speaking
She laughed lightly and she wandered away
My heart, like the snow in my story
Fell silent, I'd hoped she would stay

It's so nice to talk to somebody
To find someone who's willing to share
I know that this life is worth living
But sometimes it just isn't fair

I took two shots, got no ducks, and cold, cold hands
I took two shots, got no ducks, and cold, cold hands
Crazy love, people say I'm crazy in love
Just a fool, sighing sighs to the skies up above
It isn't normal or real, to feel heaven's right inside your door
But somehow that's how I feel, and I've never felt this way before
Crazy dreams, keep me clinging to this affair
I'm insane to keep dreaming that you could care
But I am a kind of a fool who stayed after school
I've learned my lessons well
And if this crazy love is such a crazy love, I'm glad I fell
Oooooooo
Merry Christmas, children
Bring your toys to Crystal Ship
Oooooooo

Well, down in Eugene we got girls and boys
Who wake up on Christmas morning but don't find any toys
If they're lucky their healthy mom and dad come to chat
About how they're missed, but you can change all that

Bring your toys to Crystal Ship
Oooo, for the children
Bring your toys to Crystal Ship
Oooo, for the children

Yeah, we're the Beach Boys for Crystal Ship and toys
'Cause this Christmas we want you to help spread the joy
It would feel so good, it would make them feel well
It would cheer 'em all up at Children's Hospital

Bring your toys to Crystal Ship
Oooo, for the children
Bring your toys to Crystal Ship
Oooo, for the children
Oooooooo
Merry Christmas, children
Bring your toys to Crystal Ship
Oooooooo
Merry Christmas, children
Christmas toys to Crystal Ship
Oooooooo
Ever since the day I saw your face
I've been making plans
Seemed kind of absurd when
There wasn't much for you
So I put a little word in
Just for you
Started making strategies
To get you for myself

I love your eyes
Your crazy sighs
Were tantalizing me
Push some pride aside
Mmmm too bad
I could run and hide
But I'd rather be had
Mostly it's just lonely
Only being lonely by myself

And I'm still falling for you
The thrill is still brand new
No matter what I do
It all begins and ends with you
He's hearing voices
Seems the choices
Really are but few
Hey he makes a break
Get out of there
Me act like a fool
Stand and stare
See the jokers actin'
Like there's nothin' happenin'
He just ate his cocktail napkin

Summer breezes
Through the trees
As on and on it goes
They begin to reminisce
He walks her home
And then a kiss
The rest is known
And so we leave our hero
No longer batting zero
He's in the majors now

And I'm still falling for you
The thrill is still brand new
No matter what I do
It all begins and ends with you
Baby
'Cause I'm still falling for you
And the thrill is still brand new
No matter what I do
It all begins and ends with you

And I'm still falling for you
The thrill is still brand new
No matter what I do
It all begins and ends with you
Oh

'Cause I'm still falling for you
The thrill is still brand new
No matter what I do
It all begins and ends with you
I've been in love with you baby
Honey before I learned to call your name
Yes, I was in love with you baby
Honey before I learned to call your name
Yeah, the way you treatin' me baby
Honey you gonna drive old me insane

Yeah, you know I love you

Yeah, you know I love you baby

Honey do everything I say
Yeah, if you love me baby

Just to drive me where ever you are...

Many a man has gone away
Many a man has gone astray
Searching for the treasures of a love that's true
I'm hoping that my treasure can be you
Cause I believe, I believe

The further you look
Show love now
The less you see
I'm hoping you'd be the treasure meant for me

I've seen men carry their hopes from town to town
Trying to track lost treasures down
Some find true love before their hopes are gone
Others lose hope and they have to --yes, now -- move on
And I can hear them say as they go down

The further you look
You better know that
The less you see
So I'm hoping you'd be the treasure meant for me
Oh-oh-oohhh-oh
Travel, travelling on
Wondering if they've done something wrong
Moving on becoming a rover
But if you'll be mine, my searching is all over because now

The further you look
Show love now
The less you see
I'm hoping you'll be the treasure meant for me

And I know, I know, I know
The further you look, the less you're gonna see
So I'm hoping you'd be the treasure meant for me

And I believe, I believe right now
The further you look, the less you're gonna see
So I'm hoping you'll be the treasure meant for me

Makes Papa wanna chrome up his old truck
Stop swaying windy mover shaking down
Makes Mama turn her hands and flip around
Backlashing with a bullet full of love
Makes Papa wanna chrome up his old truck
Stop swaying windy mover shaking down
Makes Mama turn her hands and flip around
Backlashing with a bullet full of love
Makes Papa wanna chrome up his old truck
Stop swaying windy mover shaking down
Makes Mama turn her hands and flip around
Backlashing with a bullet full of love
Makes Papa wanna chrome up his old truck
Stop swaying windy mover shaking down
Makes Mama turn her hands and flip around
Backlashing with a bullet full of love
Makes Papa wanna chrome up his old truck

(Get off stage, Cash. OK?)

Down a dangerous road, I have come to where I'm standing
With a heavy heart and my hat clutched in my hand
Such a foolish man, God ain't known no greater sinner
I have come in search of Jesus, hoping He will understand

If I give my soul, will He clean these clothes I'm wearin?
If I give my soul, will He put new boots on my feet?
If I bow my head and beg God for His forgiveness
Will He breathe new life within me and bring her back to me?

I had a woman once, she was kind and she was gentle
Had a child by me, who grew up to be a man
I had a steady job, 'til I started into drinking
Then I started making music travelin' with the devil's band

Oh the years went by like a mighty rush of eagles
Our dreams and plans were all scattered in the wind
And it's a lonesome life, when you lose the ones you live for
If I make my peace with Jesus will they take me back again?
If I give my soul, will he stop my hands from shaking?
If I give my soul, will my son love me again?
If I give my soul, and she knows i really mean it?
If I give my soul to Jesus will she take me back again?

If I give my soul, will He clean these clothes I'm wearin?
If I give my soul, will He put new boots on my feet?
If I bow my head and beg God for His forgiveness
Will He breathe new breath within me and bring her back to me?

[Verse 1]
Listen baby, ain't no mountain high
Ain't no valley low
Ain't no river wide enough, baby
If you need me call me
No matter where you are, no matter how far
Just call my name, I'll be there in a hurry
You don't have to worry
'Cause baby there

[Chorus]
Ain't no mountain high enough
(Ain't no valley) Ain't no valley low enough
(No river wide) Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you, baby

[Verse 2]
Remember the day, I set you free
I told you could always count on me, darling From that day on (That day on), I made a vow (Made a vow)
I'll be there when you want me
Some way, somehow
'Cause baby there

[Chorus]
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you, baby

[Bridge]
No wind, no rain or winter's cold
Can stop me, baby
If you're ever in trouble, I'll be there on the double
Just send for me, ooh, oh baby

[Verse 3]
My love is alive deep down in my heart
Although we are miles apart
If you ever need a helping hand
I'll be there on the double just as fast as I can

[Chorus]
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you, baby

[Outro]
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
I remember the day, I set you free
I told you could always count on me
From that day on...
Some way, somehow
Ain't no, huh, ain't no mountain high enough
Don't you know how much I care?
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough now, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
Ain't no mountain high enough
Intro 

[Kanye West]:
Yeah. DC. Stand up for your boy ? Oh, I go by the name of Kanye To The. The Roc is in the building. And as far as I'm concerned, we're about to bring that real soul back to the game. John Legend on the backgrounds by the way. Let's go

Verse One 

[Kanye West]:
From what I hear Kanye is killing that game very bad
My girl rockin' the little lamb that Mary had
Little bit of ghosta style mixed with Mosta style
I'm versatile, I'm the poster child
Gettin' cheese so I'm supposed to smile
Get it?
We making hits like Sosa now
Hit it!
And I, hate when girls actin' boushie as hell
And I already seen 'em naked like Blu Cantrell
If I talk to people like they stupid as hell
Do that mean God gonna make my kids stupid as well?
Well
Our Father, please for give me
I am sinner, slash winner, slash soul inventor
C'mon
Chorus 

[Kanye West]
It's so soulful man 

[x3]
And when you hear, swear it feel like soul food man

[x2]

Verse Two 

[Uncredited]
Look, my mommy don't be playin' cause she know I got my game intact
I spit them lines that make a rapper have a brain attack
And chickens know I'm gonna do it like I wanna do it
And miscommunication, no we never run into it
I got chicks like Samone and Colla
Stay with lip gloss and Fendi bag beside her
And your girl said she ain't ready for me
I'm in love so mommy got me singin' Teena Marie
High above the Giovanni, she ain't Gucci or Prada
Climbin' in the Mirada, studin' like a scholar
So I don't even bother
I be poppin' my collar
I can get into your soul when I call you tomorrow
C'mon

Chorus

Verse Three 

[John Legend]:
I know you gotta lot of stress today
Let's hit the party like we just got paid
Now if you really want to get away
Say yeah, yeah
Got people on your back constantly
And you never get a second for free
You know you gotta get away with me
So say yeah, yeah
Verse Four 

[Consequence]:
Yo, I'ma worry bout the trades and ballin'
I'm gonna trade it all
I'd rather catch up on my paper and evade them all
You sore losers picked the wrong guy to take a fall
I probably train and fall
For what they made in the fall
Made it to a never-quite-was to an overnight buzz
Cause the way I flip a metaphor, nobody quite does
By the time I leave the club
I'm weighing the pros and cons
Cause she must have been a pro the way she approach the Cons
And Con man is an army
Money boss on
We so big be hoppin' out when I'm tryin' to do my laundry
But I ain't even sorry for the way I get my doe
Cause J, Kanye and Con got that food for your soul, go!

Chorus

Outro 

[John Legend]:
Say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yes I'm changing my ways baby
I ain't gonna be like I used to be
My past is behind me baby
I ain't gonna be like I used to be
I used to give you all of my money woman
And I wouldn't save a dime for me

You used to treat me like a fool baby
Still I loved everything you done
I was just your fool, I was your fool baby
And I worshipped everything you did like a king
Yes if you ever, if you ever loved me woman
Yes I tell you baby you must have kept it hid

Yes you can go...out of your tears
And get that mistreated look off your face
Yes you know I feel what I feel baby
I tell you I just won't be no more
And then that you realise woman
Everybody's jumpin' down the...
Comin' down the...
Shock me flipping on a good drink, popping on a woo wee, while we're on the vip
Truth is but the likes my movie said she ain't no booby, she just wanna... me, let's go
Shock me flipping on a good drink, popping on a woo wee, while we're on the vip
Truth is but the likes my movie said she ain't no booby, she just wanna... me

Take my hand and follow me girl cause I want you all on me girl
She talking to me... I say let's go get laid
She thinks she's gonna... paper, after it's all said and done
She wants to pop champagne, I call some private plane
I say she want it game, after it's all said and done
I love her, I love her, I love her, I love her, I love her, I love her

Hands up, I'm... hands up, when you see my mansion and we pull up to my girl

Get your girls and follow me girl cause I can take all of three girl
See... the girl you like, so freaking so exciting, they think they're gonna get laid
After it's all said and done
She wants to pop champagne, I call some private plane
I say she want it game, after it's all said and done
I love her, I love her, I love her, I love her, I love her, I love her, let's go
They broke me, evil took my... had to call the police

Answers, anything they got her, told me to describe her
But I don't even know her name
Guess you got me... on me girl, your home is follow me girl
Right after the menage, they said they're up and ride
They bought and all get labor after it's all said and done
She wants to pop champagne, I call some private plane
I say she want it game, after it's all said and done
I love her, I love her, I love her, I love her, I love her, I love her, let's go
After it's all said and done, all said and done baby
After it's all said and done
It's something about you baby, I can't seem to get enough
Now I know you're after labor your bad just seems so good
You're better than any drug I've ever had
You know what? I got a feeling this leads to something
I'm seeing... bank accounts
You're moving your clothes into my closet and imagine...

Baby, oh, yeah
And there's she's grinding me fighting off that she's gonna be alone so she can be...
Her little body is popping in I just wanna get her home so I can so I can so
So I can walk away
I'ma take you somewhere where nobody knows
Begin with to see you coming out the clothes
I'ma put my pants on you, I'ma put my hands on you
I'ma back it up, strap it up and put this man on you
All set done, after it's all said and done
After it's all said and done, after it's all said and done, after it's all said and done
After it's all said and done, after it's all said and done

[Verse 1]
Stayed in bed all mornin' just to pass the time
There's somethin' wrong here, there can be no denyin'
One of us is changin', or maybe we both stopped tryin'

[Chorus]
And it's too late, baby, it's too late
Though we really did try to make it
Somethin' inside has died, and I know I can't hide
And I just can't fake it, oh, no, no
It's too late
Too late

[Verse 2]
It used to be so easy, livin' here with you
You were light and breezy, child, you knew just what to do
Now you look so unhappy, oh, and girl, I feel like a fool
Oh, yes I do

[Chorus]
And it's too late, baby, too late, baby, it's too late
Though we really did try to make it, yes we did
Somethin' inside has died, and I can't hide
And I, oh, I just can't fake it
Oh, I just can't fake it

[Verse 3]
There'll be good times again for me and for you
But we just can't stay together; don't you feel that too?
Still I'm glad for what we had and oh how I once loved you

[Chorus]
And it's too late, baby, it's too late
Though we really did try to make it (We can't make it)
You see somethin' inside has died, and I, oh I can't hide
And I just can't fake it
I just can't, I just can't fake it

[Outro]
It's too late, baby, oh
Said it's too late, oh, yes it is
Oh, it's too late, yeah
Said it's too late, too late
Said it's too late, ah yeah
I can't hide it no more, no no, no no
And we can't fake it, baby, oh
Oh, it's too late, yeah
And I can't fake it, and I can't take it
It's gone, baby, all gone
It's all gone, oh yeah
It's too late, yeah yeah
It's too late
It's too late, yeah
Oh, it's too late, baby
It's too late
It's too late, it's too late
It's too late
Oh, way too late
Oh, it's too late, yeah
Yeah, it's too late, baby
So long, gotta move on
Gotta move
Oh, I gotta move on
It's too late, too late, too late...
It's too late - so long, baby
So long, baby, yeah
So long, baby
It's too late, too late, too late, too late, too late, too late
Please, too late, too late
Writer(s): Cahn/Van Heusen

I'll only miss her, when I think of her
And I'll think of her, all the time
Likely I'll spend my days - hearing her turn of phrase
Things I found hard to praise - right now, would seem sublime

The truth is...

I'll Only miss her, when some stranger laughs
'Cause it's still her laugh - my hearts hears
Maybe in time - I guess, the longing will grow, the slightest bit less
And there will be moments - yes - when it disappears

I'll bet I'll forget her completely - in about a hundred years
Morning has broken
Like the first morning
Blackbird has spoken
Like the first bird

Praise for the singing
Praise for the morning
Praise for them springing
Fresh from the world

Sweet, the rain's new fall
Sunlit from heaven
Like the first dew fall
On the first grass

Praise for the sweetness
Of the wet garden
Sprung in completeness
Where His feet pass

Mine is the sunlight
Mine is the morning
Born of the one light
Eden say play
Praise with elation
Praise ev'ry morning
God's recreation of the new day

Morning has broken
Like the first morning
Blackbird has spoken
Like the first bird

Praise for the singing
Praise for the morning
Praise for them springing
Fresh from the world
You were told to wait there for love
Love said it's waiting for you
It told me I could say?
I know, it's never easy getting all dressed up
With no place to go
Helpful, that's what we're here for
All one together

Harmony gets melody
The orchestra gets its symphony
The continents get seven seas
Boy gets girl, and all you got was me
With The Promise I'd try to be honest
I'd like to give you nothing to fear

Lovers get, "I'm sorry."
Music gets to keep a key
Children get to ride for free
Mind and body is all you get of me
And The Promise I'd try to be honest
I'd like to give you nothing to fear
Nothing to fear
If your eyes were half as bright
They still would light my way
If your heart were twice as true
Then you'd be mine today
That's why I often wish that you
Were half as lovely, twice as true

I'm only one of those
Who thinks of you and sighs
Just another who knows
Your laughter and lies
I wish that you were someone who
Was half as lovely, twice as true

I love you, I love you too much it seems
For any fool can see
With your heart so crowded with other dreams
How can you dream of me?

Though I pray the gods of love
Will make you care, somehow
Still I know the odds of love
Are all against me now
But I might stand a chance if you
Were half as lovely, twice as true
I love you too much it seems
With your heart so crowded with other dreams
How can you dream of me?

Maybe if your loveliness were not so heavenly
Maybe then I might possess the only one for me
I wish you that were someone who
Was half as lovely, twice as true

[Chorus:]
It takes 3, U and me
And her 2 - tell me pretty baby what U wanna do

I've seen the future, baby, and it looks like U and I
All wrapped up in love that'll never die
Maybe I just want another 2 keep U happy while I'm away
A friend as special as U should never be lonely, a single day

It takes 3
If U ain't got a friend U can't be with me (Hey)
It takes 3

Nothin' I want 2 do will make U uncomfortable, I swear
Wherever my hands go, baby, it'll be cuz U put 'em there
I could be satisfied with talking about all we could do
But I'm wise enough 2 know that's the only way 2 get wit' U
And her 2

[Chorus]
It takes 3
If U ain't got a friend U can't be with me
It takes 3
Check this out
U know my every thought if U think about it long enough
Don't ask me why, nothing's lost if U try
But 2 not, is 2 never know if U and me and her could flow
Let's go, let's go 2 the land of "Yes I will"
G'on put your foot up on that window sill

It takes 3
If U ain't got a friend U can't be with me (Hey)

[Chorus]
Hell yeah, baby
Shake all that

[Chorus]
Girl, U got something the whole world should see
I'm so proud of U
If I can't get a witness who'll believe it's true (It takes 3)
Nobody, that's why it takes 3
If U ain't got a friend U can't see me (It takes 3)
U can't see me

(It takes 3)
Fellows g'on and sing that I'm jettin'
(If U ain't got a friend U can't be with me)
Don't forget your rain coat

[Verse 1]

[Shawn Stockman]
I'm, I'm so in love with you
Whatever you want to do
Is alright with me
'Cause you make me feel so brand new
And I want to spend my life with you
Ooh

[Nathan Morris]
Since, baby
Since we've been together
Loving you forever
Is what I need
Let me be the one you come running to
And I'll never be untrue

[Chorus]
So let's, let's stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad
Ooh
Good or bad, happy or sad

[Verse 2: Wanya Morris]
Why, why people break up
Ah, and turn around and make up
I just can't see
You'd never do that to me
Being around you is all I see
All I wanna do is...

[Chorus]
Let's, let's stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, baby, happy or sad

Let's, let's stay together, yeah

I pull up at the light and see you looking my way {ho! }

[Verse 2:]
I gotta make a move before the light tries to change {oh}
I let down my window and tell you to just follow me {un-huh, un-huh, un-huh}
I know you wanna come but you seem a little afraid
Trust me (trust me)
Say I promise I won't hurt you baby {here we go, here we go}

[Bridge:]
I can't wait (I can't wait yeah) {uh huh}
To show you all around the world (all around the world) {one more time, one more time}
Oh girl oh girl
Feels so good I wanna say it again yeah

(Whatever happened to Christmas, ah)

Whatever happened to Christmas? It's gone and left no traces
Whatever happened to the faces or the glow
Whatever happened to Christmas, to Christmas way of living?
Whatever happened to the giving, the magic in the snow?

Remember the sights and the smells and the sounds
And remember the cheery call
Remember how love was all around
Whatever happened to it all?

Whatever happened to Christmas, bells in the streets are ringing
Whatever happened to the singing, the songs we used to know
Whatever happened to Christmas, and when it disappeared from view
Where was I, and whatever happened to you?

(Whatever happened to Christmas) and you?
Rock, rock and roll
Plymouth Rock, roll over
Rock, rock and roll
Plymouth Rock, roll over

Bicycle rider, just see what you've done
To the church of the American Indian ...

Rock, rock and roll
Plymouth Rock, roll over
Rock, rock and roll
Plymouth Rock, roll over

Mahalo lu le, Mahalo lu la, Keeni waka pula
I awake and it is morning
I breathe and it is wind
I stand up and it is sunrise
I wander and it is clouds moving
I drink and it is rivers flowing
I walk and it is horses racing
I roar and it is thunder
I jump and it is spring
I open my eyes and it is summer
I lay down and it is fall
I kiss the earth and it is winter

[Intro]
Yo, what's up, baby?
I don't see any sign on my door that says it's closed

[Chorus]
Step in my room 'cause I got a little something for you
In my room and I know you're gonna like it, baby
Step in my room 'cause I got a little something for you
In my room

[Verse 1]
Finally we're all alone
So lock all the doors and unplug the phone
I wanna take you where passion lies
Girl, you want my loving, I can see it in your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, don't hold back the feeling, just bring your body to me
And I'm gonna give you everything you need

[Chorus]
Step in my room 'cause I got a little something for you
In my room and I know you're gonna like it, baby
Step in my room 'cause I got a little something for you
In my room

[Verse 2]
Making sweet love 'til morning comes
Still loving you after it's said and done
And doing those things you want me to do to you, baby
Like going down on you by the fireplace

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby don't hold back the feeling, just bring your body to me
And I'm gonna give you everything you need

[Chorus]
Step in my room 'cause I got a little something for you
In my room and I know you're gonna like it, baby
Step in my room 'cause I got a little something for you
In my room

[Bridge]
Hey there lady, you drive me crazy
Sexy lady, you drive me crazy

[Chorus]
Step in my room 'cause I got a little something for you
In my room and I know you're gonna like it, baby
Step in my room 'cause I got a little something for you
In my room

[Verse 1]
The morning bell, the morning bell
Light another candle and
Release me
Release me

[Verse 2]
You can keep the furniture, a bump on the head
Howling down the chimney
Release me
Release me, yeah
Release me
Release me

[Verse 3]
Where'd you park the car?
Where'd you park the car?
Your clothes are on the lawn with the furniture
And I might as well, I might as well
Sleepy jack the fire drill
Run around, around, around, around
And round

[Bridge]
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half

[Outro]
Release me
Release me
Release me
Release me
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be. Yeah
There will be an answer, let it be

And when the night is cloudy
There is still a light that shines on me
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
I used to walk with you along the avenue, our hearts were young and gay
How could I know I'd lose you somewhere along the way
The friends we used to know, would always smile hello
No love like our love, they say then love slipped through our fingers
Somewhere along the way
I should forget, but with the loneliness of night, I start remembering everything
You're gone and yet there's still a feeling deep inside that you'll always be part of me
So now I look for you along the avenue, and as I wander I pray
That someday soon, I'll find you, somewhere along the way
The joint was jumping on the corner down on Honky Tonk Street
All of a sudden up pulled a Cadillac and out stepped a can named Pete
A diamond on every finger, he wore he wore a tailor made suit
Black cigar, he wore a Stetson hat
He wore a pair on cowboy boots
Busted on through the door mad as he could be
Don't mess around, I'll cut you down 'cause my name is Big Boy Pete
The music stopped, there wasn't a sound
Up in the corner stood Bad Man Brown
He smiled and grinned, he said you know my friend
Take two steps further I'm going kick you in the hide
Forty-Five keep it alive, seven bullets on my side
Brown pulled a knife, jumped on Pete
Fought from the counter right on out to the street
They swung from the north, swung from the south
Pete got the blackjack out
Brown went out his mind, yes he did, now we deeply see
If you're ever down on the corner, down on Honky Tonk Street
Don't mess around he'll cut you down
Take a lesson from Big Boy Pete
After you've gone - and left me crying
After you've gone - there's no denying
You'll feel blue - you're gonna be sad
You've missed the dearest pal that (slickest partner) you ever had

There'll come a time - don't you forget it
(Yeah) There'll come a time - when you're gonna regret it
Some day when you get lonely
Your heart will break like mine - (and) you'll want me only

After you've gone (split) - after you've gone away (flown the coop)

After we paid - our dues together
You should have stayed - through all that nasty weather
Someday while you're feeling badly
You'll need the only one that loves you so madly

But I'll be gone - yes I'll be gone - to stay
Yeah after I've gone - after I've gone away
Should old acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind
Should old acquaintance be forgot
And days of Auld Lang Syne
For Auld Lang Syne, my dear...

Spoken:
Hi, this is Denny, and speaking for the rest of the guys
I'd like to say that it has been a great pleasure
For all of us to bring you this Christmas album
We hope you will treasure it the way we do
And if you hap happen to be listening to this album right now
Mike, Brian, Carl, Al and I would like to wish every one of you a very merry Christmas
And we hope the new year brings you as much happiness as this year has brought us
Thank you very much

...May old acquaintance be forgot
And days of Auld Lang Syne
My Mama told me, Papa done told me too
That gal you're foolin' with ain't no good for you
But that's allright, that's allright
That's allright now Mama, anyway you do
One and one is two, two and two is four
Don't leave me baby when you walk out the door
That's allright, that's allright
That's allright now Mama, anyway you do
That's allright Mama, that's allright with you
That's allright Mama, anyway you do
Grandma came to see
Something she could not believe
How could her girl be
So naive

Tar baby
Tar baby told the secret she conceived

Oh, that big old smile of yours
Could turn the wind into a song
How could I have doubted
Honey, it's with me that you belong

Tar baby
Tar baby, I love you so
I love you

Like a brand new blade
You cut into my life
Cut through two decades
Like a hot coal on ice
Tar baby, my tar baby
It maybe was meant to be
When I look at you
I can't believe my eyes
And with your magic
I think you just might charm the birds out of the skies

Tar baby, tar baby
Tar baby came good out of grief

A golden thread inside of the web
That I got caught in
Oh, it's a lover's revenge
But out of the pain come the best things

You cut into my life
You cut into my life (Baby, baby, baby, baby, don't you know that)
You cut into my life (I love you)
You cut into my life

La la la la la ooh
You can turn the wind into a song
La la la la la, baby, baby, baby
It's with me you belong
I know why I waited, I know why I've been blue
I've prayed each night for someone exactly like you
Why should we spend money on a show or two
No one does those love scenes exactly like you
You make me feel so grand
I wanna give my world to you
You make me understand, these foolish little dreams
And schemes I'm scheming

I know why my mother taught me to be true
She meant me for someone exactly like you

You make me feel so grand
I wanna give the whole world to you
You make me understand, these foolish little dreams I'm dreaming
And schemes I'm scheming

I know why my mother taught me to be true
She meant me for someone, oh exactly like you
Look at me , i don't know what i'm doin'
Ever since i looked at you
How did i get this crazy feelin'
Could it be , i'm in love with you

Ever since i saw you in the moonlight
I've had this feeling through and through
Since that time , i haven't done a thing right
Could it be , i'm in love with you

Golly gee , i don't know where i'm goin'
I'm tryin' to make you see
Oh boy, i got to make her fall in love with me , oh

Night after night , i'm always dreamin'
Why don't you make those dreams come true
Can't you see how much i really love you
Why don't you learn to love me too

(break)
Golly gee , i don't know where i'm goin'
I'm tryin' to make you see
Oh boy, i got to make her fall in love with me

Night after night , i'm always dreamin'
Why don't you make those dreams come true
Can't you see how much i really love you
Why don't you learn to love me too
Love me too
Love me too

[Verse 1]
Ooh
Lonely man am I
Ever since you said goodbye
Girl I know that I should have woke up
'Cause it seems now that we've broke up
Your farewell kiss is haunting me
My two lips cry out constantly
Let your heart, let your heart be your guide
Forget about your foolish pride

[Verse 2]
Starting tomorrow I keep telling myself
I'm gonna get out and find me somebody else
Somebody thats sweet and kind
Who will erase you out of my mind
But tell me how can I find somebody new baby?
When my two arms keep reaching out for you
And my two lips keep right on repeating
Its you that I need, woah

[Verse 3]
You know that even when I close my eyes to forget ya
I see your face and your memories too
Girl I've never felt this lonelyness before
And whoa, girl I just can't take it no more
Every night a million tears I shed
Girl I'm only goin out of my head
Just take a good look and you'll see
What this loneliness is doin' to me

[Bridge]
(Uh baby it's you that need)
Ooh dont you know that its you that I need (Baby)
Oh I can't take this loneliness, (It's you that I need)
Awww baby I need ya, (It's you that I need)
Oooooh

[Verse 4]
Some fool im gonna be no more
'Cause I'll soon be knockin', knockin' on your door
Gonna get down on my bended knees
Beg and plead girl come back to me
It's you that I need (Every night a million tears I shed)
Girl it's you that I need (Every morning goin' out of my head)
Girl take a good look and you'll see a
What does this loneliness

[Verse 1]
Made your acquaintance late one night
You were floating around, you know you gave me quite a fright
You didn't seem like an ordinary man
More like a ray of light
You transcendentally imposed yourself upon my bed
You know you didn't say very much
I'm out of body and I feel so good in my head
You know I'm really quite touched

[Pre-Chorus]
I wake up with your fragrance and it's all over me
What cologne do you wear?
I walk around with a smile on my face, 'cause you're close to me
Well I know you're somewhere

[Chorus]
Gonna take my chance on a different kind of romance
A supernatural thing
Gonna have my fill, it gives me such a big thrill to be with
A supernatural thing

[Verse 2]
I stay uplifted for quite some time
(You say you've lived here for quite some time)
And I'd say that your skills as a lover are very refined
You know just what I want and I don't have to ask
Are you reading my mind?
You're not demanding for a man, that's really quite rare
You're not the least bit obsessed with your hair
You're not upset when I come home later than ten
For a ghost you're a very good friend

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got to be a very careful, never know what the neighbors would say
They already think I'm crazy
I wouldn't like to wake up and find myself in the family way
A ghost baby?

[Chorus]
Gonna take my chance on a different kind of romance
A supernatural thing
Gonna have my fill, it gives me such a big thrill to be with
A supernatural thing
Gonna take my chance on a different kind of romance
A supernatural thing
Gonna have my fill, it gives me such a big thrill to be with
A supernatural thing

[Interlude]
I can't see you
I know you're out there you little rascal
Stop that

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got to be a very careful, never know what the neighbors would say
They already think I'm crazy
I wouldn't like to wake up and find myself in the family way
A ghost baby?

[Chorus]
Gonna take my chance on a different kind of romance
A supernatural thing
Gonna have my fill, it gives me such a big thrill to be with
A supernatural thing
Gonna take my chance on a different kind of romance
A supernatural thing
Gonna have my fill, it gives me such a big thrill to be with
A supernatural thing

[Outro]
Gonna take my pants off for a different kind of romance
That super-duper naturally big thing
It's outrageously large
(Gonna take my chance on a different kind of romance)
(A supernatural thing)
(Gonna have my fill)
(It gives me such a big thrill to be with)
(A supernatural thing)

[Verse 1]
Total insubordination
Complete revolt, formal sabotage
Still it must be stressed that on this port
There is no room for compromise

[Verse 2]
Faint, all our crime is crime of physical setting
Except inside the mind (all inside the mind)
How come more and more futile
The American dream is the fertilize (oh the fertilize)

[Chorus]
Nothing at all can be expected
Except for the use of violence
Nothing at all can be changed if
Evolution turned us to silence

[Verse 3]
Confrontations clearing the way (confrontations clearing)
Will be opening (they will be opening)
Not as an end in itself but (not as an end in itself)
As a beginning (but as a beginning)

[Chorus]
Nothing at all can be expected
Except for the use of violence
Nothing at all can be changed if
Evolution turned us to silence

[Verse 3]
Confrontations clearing the way
Will be opening, will be opening (they will be opening)
Not as an end in itself but
As a beginning, as a beginning (as a beginning)

[Chorus]
Nothing at all can be expected
Except for the use of violence
Nothing at all can be changed if
Evolution turned us to silence
Yes, be careful with a fool
'Cos someday he may get smart
Yes, be careful with a fool
'Cos someday he may get smart
Yes, he'll treat you so cold and chilly
It will hurt you to your heart

I hate to remember
How foolish I used to be
I hate to remember
How foolish I used to be
Well, you know the way I used to love you, baby
And how bad you treated me

I used to cry about you baby
And walk the streets late at night
I used to cry about you baby
And walk the streets late at night
Yes, if you love me a little bit, baby
Why don't you treat me half way right?
It's finally over, baby
Babe, I know this is the end
It's finally over, baby
Babe, I know this is the end
I've got you off of my mind, woman
And I've started over again
Here we all work 'long the Mississippi
Here we all work while the white boys play
Gettin no rest from the dawn till sunset
Gettin no rest till the judgment day
You don't look up, you don't look down
You don't dare make the rich boss frown
Bend your knees and bow your head
And tote that barge until you're dead
Let me go 'way from the Mississippi
Let me go 'way from the rich man boss
Show me that stream called the River Jordan
That's the old stream that I long to cross
Ol' Man River, Ol' Man River
He don't say nothin, he must know somethin
Ol' Man River, he just keeps rollin' along
You know, you know he don't plant taters
And we all know the man don't plant no cotton
And then, and then what plants 'em, all know is soon forgotten
But Ol' Man River, he just keeps rollin' along
You, you and me
You know sometimes we have to we have to sweat, sweat and strain
Our bodies, our bodies are all achin' and wracked with a whole lot of pain
Tote that barge, lift that bale, you get a little drunk
And you land in ja-ail
I get weary and so sick of tryin'
I'm tired of livin', and fraid of dyin'
But Ol' Man River, he just keeps rollin' a-
Ol' Man River, he just keeps rollin' along, ooh
Something that I hunger for
Something you deny
You say I'm bad for you
And baby so do I
Don't you know that all you gotta do
You could be a lover
And baby this is

This is your life
Don't break it
It's who you do it for
It's the pain and pleasure
This is your life
Temptation
A victim of the law
We can talk about it
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
This is your life
This is your life

If you try to help someone
You get the evil eye
You say you suffocate
Well baby so do I
Don't you know that all you gotta do
You could be a lover
And baby this is
This is your life
Don't hide it
Don't try to mystify
How soft the flesh is
This is your life
Get even, even if you die
Don't run for cover
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
This is your life
Temptation
That's who you do it for
It's the pain and the pleasure
This is your life
Temptation
A victim of the law
We can talk about it
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
This is your life

Define ourselves
As something in space
Not enough for everyone
Everyone and as we speak
The enemy is the mind
I see the future coming for you
All the lonely days and the lonely nights
You've been searching for a love so right
It's a tragedy just stayin' alive
Stayin' alive
And all that
Jive talking
What you doing on your back
Jive talking
More rap less crap
Times are bad, money is tight
Ain't too much heaven on
A Saturday night
Tell me now how deep is your love
The heart is soft
But the brain is tough

The enemy is the mind
Don't let the future fall apart
This is my world too, just run to me
If you ever wanna mend that broken heart
I have seen those nights on Broadway too
Blaming it all
What about you
This is your life

This is your life
Don't hide it
Don't try to mystify
How soft the flesh is
This is your life
It's who you do it for
It's the pain and pleasure
This is your life
Temptation
This is your life

[Intro]
Hoo!
Hee!

[Verse 1]
Live and sin
Ten years ago on this day, my heart was yearnin'
I promised I would never ever be returnin'
Where my baby broke my heart and left me yearnin', hee, hee!
As we walked into the room, there were faces
Starin', glarin', tearin' through me
Someone said welcome to your doom
Then they smiled with eyes that looked as if they knew me
This is scarin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
We walked up the stairs still concealing gloom
There were two girls sittin' in my room
She walked up to my face, and said this is the place
You said meet you right here at noon (Boo!)

[Chorus]
This is Heartbreak Hotel
Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
So this is Heartbreak Hotel
This place is Heartbreak Hotel

[Verse 2]
Hope is dead
She thought that I had cheated for another lover
I turn my back to see that I am undercover
Now I can't convince this girl there ain't no other, hee, hee!
Someone's evil to hurt my soul
Every smile's trial thought in beguile
This is scarin' me
Then the man next door had told
He's been here in tears for fifteen years
This is scarin' me

[Pre-Chorus]
We came to this place, where the vicious dwell
And found that wicked women run this strange hotel
There was Sefra and Sue, every girl that I knew
And my baby said love is through (Boo!)

[Chorus]
This is Heartbreak Hotel
Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
So evil Heartbreak Hotel
This place is Heartbreak Hotel
Someone stop my heart (Heartbreak Hotel)
This is Heartbreak Hotel, hee! (Heartbreak Hotel)
Ten years ago on today (Heartbreak Hotel)
This is Heartbreak Hotel, hee! (Heartbreak Hotel)

[Guitar Solo]
Hoo!

[Chorus]
Someone stop my heart (Heartbreak Hotel)
This is Heartbreak Hotel, hee! (Heartbreak Hotel)
Ten years ago on today (Heartbreak Hotel)
Hurtin' my mind, hoo! (Heartbreak Hotel)
You break my baby’s heart (Heartbreak Hotel)
This is Heartbreak Hotel (Heartbreak Hotel)
Just welcome to the scene, hoo!
No, oh I
Columbine my frail design
I see you see me standing on my own
Is it you that I'm walking through
Should I retrace my point of view
I'm left in clouded dreams of finding who
Not Columbine
Just incase you're my disguise
I found yourself to my surprise
I'm on the ground
And it's Harlequin who fix me up
Who catches you
Who wanishes me
From finding who
You are
La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La
La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La
La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La
La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La

I shall sing
Sing my song
Be it right
Be it wrong
In the night
In the day
Anyhow
Anyway
I shall ging
La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La
La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La-La

La-La-La-...

With my heart
With my soul
For the young
For the old
When I'm high
When I'm low
When I'm fast
When I'm slow
Who ah
I shall sing
La-La-La-

La-La-La-
My only sunshine
You make me happy
When skies are grey
You'll never know, dear
How much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away
The other nite, dear
As I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms
When I awoke, dear
I was mistaken
And I hung my head and cried
You are my sunshine
My only sunshine
You make me happy
When skies are grey
You'll never know, dear
How much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away
I'll always love you
And make you happy
If you will only say the same
But if you leave me
To love another
You'll regret it all some day;
You are my sunshine
My only sunshine
You make me happy
When skies are grey
You'll never know, dear
How much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away
You told me once, dear
You really loved me
And no one else could come between
But now you've left me
And love another
You have shattered all my dreams;
You are my sunshine
My only sunshine
You make me happy
When skies are grey
You'll never know, dear
How much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away
Louisiana my Louisiana
The place where I was borne
White fields of cotton
-- green fields clover
The best fishing
And long tall corn;
You are my sunshine
My only sunshine
You make me happy
When skies are grey
You'll never know, dear
How much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away
Crawfish gumbo and jambalaya
The biggest shrimp and sugar cane
The finest oysters
And sweet strawberries
From Toledo Bend to New Orleans;
You are my sunshine
My only sunshine
You make me happy
When skies are grey
You'll never know, dear
How much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away
They told me you'd leave me all alone and blue
And it all came true, yep, it all came true
They told me you'd grieve me, fall to someone new
It all came true, it all came true
They said that someday, you won't love him any more
And you'll come running right back to my little old shack
And take up where you left before
They told me you'd love me like you used to do
It all came true, it all came true

They told me you'd leave me so all alone and blue
And it all came true, oh, it's so true
They told me you'd grieve me, fall for somebody new
It all came true, so T-R-U
They said that someday, you won't love him any more
And you'll come running right back to my little old shack
And take up where you left before
They told me you'd love me like you used to do
It all came true, it all came true
They told me you'd love me like you used to do
And it all came true

[Intro]
Hee, oh baby

[Verse 1]
Life's a nightmare and I can't stand it
Since you turned me loose
And you know without your lovin'
My life has no use
I know I made mistakes now, baby
Thinking love would pull me through
Honey, honey, now my love starving heart is killing me
Darling, since I lost you

[Chorus]
Love starved heart of mine, killing me
Wanting you more than before
Love starved heart of mine, killing me
Don't turn me from your door

[Verse 2]
I guess you know I've thrown my pride
Right down in the dirt
What else can I do now, baby?
Won't you come take away the hurt
Honey, honey, all the walls of my poor heart
Can't take it now that you're gone
They're gonna cave right in now, honey
The pain is much too strong, oh

[Chorus]
Love starved heart of mine, killing me
I've seen you give a beggar a dime
Love starved heart of mine, killing me
So have pity on this heart of mine

[Bridge]
Do it, ow! Go 'head
Do it, baby
This love starved heart of mine Woo, oh
Sure is killing me

[Verse 3]
Life's a nightmare and I can't stand it
Since you turned me lose
And you know without your lovin'
My life has no use
I know I made mistakes now, darling
Thinking love would pull me through
Honey, honey, now my love starving heart is killing me
Honey, since I lost you, oh

[Outro]
Love starved heart of mine, killing me
Wanting you more than before, oh
Love starved heart of mine, killing me
Don't turn me from your door, oh
Love starved heart of mine, killing me
I've seen you give a beggar a dime, baby
Love starved heart of mine

After all the jacks are in their boxes
And the clowns have all gone to bed
You can hear happiness staggering on down the street
Footprints dressed in red
And the wind wispers mary
A broom is drearily sweeping
Up the broken pieces of yesterdays life
Somewhere a queen is weeping
Somewhere a king has no wife
And the wind wispers Mary

The traffic lights turn blue tomorrow
And shine their emptiness down, down on my bed
The tiny island sags downstream
'cause the life that lived is, is dead
And the wind screams Mary
And the wind cries Mary

Will the wind ever remember
The names it has blown in the past
With its crutch, its old age, and its wisdom
It whispers "no, this won't be the last"
And the wind cries Mary
And the wind cries Mary

[Verse 1]
Blessed is he who reads aloud the words of the prophecy
And blessed are those who hear
And who keep what is written therein
For the time is near

He is coming with the clouds
And every eye will see him
Everyone who pierced him
And all the tribes of the earth will wail on account of him

Those of you who have not learned
What some call the deep things of Satan
I know your works
I know your toil
And your patient endurance
And how you cannot hear evil men
But have tested those who call themselves
Apostles
But are not
And found them to be false
I know you are enduring patiently
And bearing out
For my namesake
And you have not grown weary
But I have this against you
That you have abandoned
The love you had
I know your tribulation and your poverty
And the slander of those who say
That they are Jews
But they are not
They are a synagogue of Satan
Do not fear what you are about to suffer
Behold the devil is about to throw you into prison

[Refrain]
Wanting, needing, waiting
For you to justify my love
Hoping, praying
For you to justify my love

[Verse 2]
And I saw a beast rising out of the sea
With ten horns and seven heads
And a blasphemous name upon its head
And the beast that I saw was like a leopard
Its feet were like a bear's
And its mouth was like a lion's mouth
And to it the dragon gave his power
And his throne
And great authority

One of his heads had a mortal wound
But it seemed to have a mortal wound
That was healed
And the whole earth followed the beast with wonder
Men worshipped the dragon
For he had given his authority to the beast
And they worshipped the beast saying
"Who is like the beast and who can fight against the beast?"
And the beast was given a mouth
Uttering haughty and blasphemous words
And it was allowed to exercise authority for forty-two months
It opened its mouth to utter blasphemous
Words
Against
God

It was allowed to make war on the saints
And to conquer them
And authority was given it over every tribe
And a people and tongue and nation
And all who dwell on earth could worship it
In vain
If anyone has an ear let him hear
If anyone is to be taken captive, into captivity he will go
If anyone who slays with the sword, with the sword

[Refrain]
Wanting, needing, waiting
For you to justify my love
Hoping

[Verse 3]
Then
I saw a new heaven
And a new earth
And I heard a great voice from the throne saying
"Behold the dwelling of God is with men
He will dwell with them
And they shall be his people
And God himself will be with them
He will wipe away every tear from their eyes
And death shall be no more
Neither shall there be mourning
Nor crying
Nor pain
Anymore
For these things will have passed away"

To the thirsty I will give water without price
From the fountain of the water of life
He who conquers shall have this heritage
And I will be his God and he shall be my son

But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the polluted
As for the murderers, fornicators, sorcerers, idolators
And all liars
Their lot shall be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone

And he said to me
He said to me
"Do not seal up the words of the prophecy
For the time is near
Let the evildoers still do evil
And the filthy still be filthy
And the righteous still do right
And the holy still be holy
Behold
I am coming soon
I am the alpha
And the omega
The first
And the last
The beginning
And the end"
Amen

[Outro]

Oh oh, woo ooh hoo ooh
Shaking in the forest, what have you to fear?
Here there may be tigers, to punch you in the ear
With gloves of stainless steel, bats carved out of brick
Knock you down and beat you up and give your ass a kick
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love

Shaking in the desert, now wherefore do you cry?
Here there may be rattlesnakes, to punch you in the eye
With shotgun's full of silver and bullet's made of glass
String barbed wire at your feet, that do not let you pass
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love

When push comes to shove
When push comes to shove
You're afraid of love
When push comes to shove

Shaking in the bedroom, covers on your head
Cringing like a baby at the hand beneath the bed?
Phantom in the closet, scratching at the door
Believe it's the mystery killer that you saw on channel four
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love
Shaking in the garden, the fear within you grows
Here there may be roses, to punch you in the nose
Twist their arms around you, snap you till you cry
Wrap you in their sweet perfume and love you 'til you die
When push comes to shove, you're afraid of love

When push comes to shove
When push comes to shove
You're afraid of love
When push comes to shove

When push comes to shove
When push comes to shove
You're afraid of love
When push comes to shove

[Verse 1]
Since I met you baby my whole life has changed
Since I met you baby my whole life has changed
And my friends all tell me that I am not the same

[Verse 2]
I don't need nobody to tell my troubles to
Well, I don't need nobody to tell my troubles to
'Cause since I met you baby all I need is you

[Verse 3]
Since I met you baby I'm a happy man
Yeah, since I met you baby I'm a happy man
I'm gonna try to please you in every way I can
You wander around on your own little cloud
When you don't see the why or the wherefore
You walk out on me when we both disagree
'Cause to reason is not what you care for
I've heard it all a million times before
Take off your coat, my love, and close the door
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin', don't stand in the pouring rain
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin', the night is long
Forget your foolish pride, nothing's wrong
Now you're beside me again

You try to be smart, then you take it to heart
'Cause it hurts when your ego is deflated
You don't realize that it's all compromise
And the problems are so overrated
Goodbye means nothing when it's all for show
So why pretend you've somewhere else to go
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin', don't stand in the pouring rain
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin', the night is long
Forget your foolish pride, nothing's wrong
Now you're beside me again
Don't sleep in the subway, darlin'...
(Ronnie VanZant -- Allen Collins -- Gary Rossington)

Well ever since I met you babe you've been running around
Spendin' my hard earned money on any ol' man in town
I've been your fool
Oh I've been your fool
I've been a fool ever since mama I met you

Now I got something to you mama, ain't gonna say no lie
Ain't gonna stand no runnin' around, don't wanna hear no alibi
I've been your fool
Oh I've been your fool
I've been a fool ever since mama I met you

I've been a fool ever since mama I met you

Oh, I've been a fool baby

Now I got something to you mama, ain't gonna say no lie

He'd sing his song most every night
Wishing she was there behind the light
The people danced and sang along
On the cardboard stage he never sang it wrong
And the piper played the tune
And the drummer wore his spurs
But the song that the singer sang was for her

Now the singer's song is never heard
And the visions he once saw are disappeared
Now they never dance or sing along
But on the cardboard stage he never sang it wrong
And the piper played the tune
And the drummer wore his spurs
But the song that the singer sang was for her
(Hold... hold... hold onto your wits!) {sample}

Break down
This is a bust (Hold onto your wits!)
All U sorry motherfuckers up against the wall
If U don't play, bite the dust
Cuz in a couple of simple fuckin' phrases
I'm gonna hip U 2 the fuckin' place of
The brand new mad style, uh
Cuz these are the days of wild - hit me!
(Hold onto your wits!) {x2}

Pop guns and weed? Brother please!
We're 2 wise 4 now, since the other 90's was better suited 4 that biz
Back when Dick was fuckin' Liz
Before soda pop had fizz
Don't blame it on a jockstrap full of jizz
Mentality so insane
I got a Tech-9 2 and it's called my brain
Shoot another brother? Not 2day
Death from envy is the only way
Here I can tear shit up cuz that's my style
And these are the days of wild - hit me! (Hold onto your wits!)
These are the days of wild (Hold onto your wits!)
These are the days of wild
Hooker, bitch and ho, I don't think so
I only knew one and never told her though
I thought about many times (Diss me?)
But that's the kind of shit that make U check your mind
Is your blood type the type that flows
Or is your blood type the type just stereo?
A woman every day should be thanked
Not disrespected, not raped or spanked
And if a woman ever said I did
Uh, she's a motherfuckin' liar and I'm a set-up kid
And I can tear shit up y'all cuz that's my style
And these are the days of wild - hit me! (Hold onto your wits!)
These are the days of wild (Hold onto your wits!)

Oh oh oh, by the way, I play guitar!

Tennis shoes and caps, now that's phat
Up until the day another wanna laugh behind your back
Sayin' we all look the same, huh
God bless America, home of the brave
I'd rather dress 2 make a woman stare
I'm puttin' on somethin' that another won't dare
It's a freezer burn compared 2 cool
And if U still got loot, then who's the fool?
Everybody wanna take the stand
Mind your own motherfucker, let a man be a man
I can tear shit up y'all cuz that's my style
And these are the days of wild - hit me! (Hold onto your wits!)
These are the days of wild - hit me! (Hold onto your wits!)
These are the days of wild - hit me!
Much props 2 the upside down double 6
Baddest, freezer burnin', head turnin', make a brother yearnin'
Sister walkin' the face
U know who U are
4 love

(Hold onto your wits!) {x2}

Hit me! {repeat 2 fade}

[Chorus]
There's a magazine called Sunset
And a tape machine that won't let
Me ever forget this impossible longing for you

[Verse 1]
Let's take a map across your pillow
And breathe the sky in through your window
I'll stay in the riddle and watch your books cave in

[Verse 2]
Oh, maybe you're my inspiration
Just lead me to some new sensation
I'll make a little guide they can call our own

[Chorus]
'Cause there's a magazine called Sunset
And a tape machine that won't let
Me ever forget this impossible longing for you

[Bridge]
Oh, I'm a future fallout standing
In the present erase our phantom

[Chorus]
There's a magazine, there's a magazine
Oh, there's a magazine, oh yeah

[Bridge]
Oh, I'm a future fallout standing
In the present erase our phantom

[Chorus]
There's a magazine
And a tape machine
That's everything
Oh, there's a magazine
And a tape machine
Oh that's everything, oh yeah

In the kitchen cookin' Rest In Peace to my grandma
Nigga ran off so Imma blow his fuckin' head off
You can work for me cause now you got a dead boss

(Hook)
I never feel a thing is real
When I'm away from you
Out of your embrace
The world's a temporary parking place

Mmm, mm, mm, mm
A bubble for a minute
Mmm, mm, mm, mm
You smile, the bubble has a rainbow in it

Say, its only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Yes, it's only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

Without your love
It's a honky-tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade
It's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

[Verse 1]
Well all right, take me back, hold my hand
All the way back to the brotherland
Take me back, I want to go back, oh
Take me back with my funky ass band
All the way back to the brotherland
Take me back, let's go

[Chorus]
I want to go as fast as I can
Slidin' on back to the brotherland
Now children, take me on back
Take me on back, take me on back
Take me on back (East L.A.)

You're like a sailor with a girl on every shore
Stay with them now for they won't see you no more
Like a gypsy forever on the run
Stay for a while, while you look for a home

Like that sailor leaves, come back again
Stay for a while, and they won't see you again
Like that gypsy caravan forever on the run
You stay for a while, then you pick up and go

(thank you)
I snore in my sleep, I'm always late for dinner
And my table cloth doodling is notorious
Ah but lovely one, keep this matter glorious
And love me as I am
I dream while I drive, I linger in the shower
And there isn't much rhythm in that waltz of mine
Ah but lovely one, skip those little faults of mine
And love me as I am
And don't try to make any changes, it wouldn't be worth your tears
Don't try to make any changes, ss my mother's been trying for years
I sing when I drink, I never cap the toothpaste
And my company manners are deplorable, ah but lovely one, tell me I'm adorable
And love me as I am
I'm a soldier (in the army of the Lord)
I'm a soldier (in the army)
I'm a soldier (in the army of the Lord)
I'm a soldier (in the army)

Well, I've got a mother, in the promised land
Not gonna stop, till I shake her righteous hand
I am weak, but Thou art strong
Jesus got the power, for the right and the wrong
Keep on walking, up the narrow way
One of these days, you're gonna hear me say

I'm a soldier (in the army of the Lord)
I'm a soldier (in the army)
Yes, I'm a soldier (in the army of the Lord)
I'm a soldier (in the army)

Well, I've been to the river, been baptized
Soul is anchored in Jesus, feel alright
You can believe, I've been redeemed
Come and go with with me brother, to the ...
I'm a soldier (in the army of the Lord)
I'm a soldier (in the army)
I am working for my Lord (in the army of the Lord)
I am working for my Lord (in the army)

I'm a soldier (in the army of the Lord)
I'm a soldier (in the army)

Well, I went in the valley, didn't go to stay
Truth got me happy brother, way down deep
My hand got stuck, to the gospel plow
I wouldn't take nothin', for my journey right now

I'm a soldier (in the army of the Lord)
I'm a soldier (in the army)
I am fighting for my Lord (in the army of the Lord)
I am fighting for my Lord (in the army)

Hey, I'm a soldier (in the army of the Lord)
I'm a soldier (in the army)
(feat. Santana & CEE LO)

[Lauryn's rap]
Watch the master plan, the pastures span
Through the streets, move the sheep
Flipped the beat, like the shepherd
It's a new day, my crew stay forever striving
Give thanks cause we alive, and been through the gutter
Now we see the horizon
It's clear to me now
Used to be confused, took a lot of years to see how
Now, we moving planets
Take the average mind and expand it
You take for granted like we're always gonna be disadvantaged
But soon come, it soon come, ya soon done
Ya start run, you stumble, we catch one
In the rhythm, Santana lick the guits with precision
Not accidental, intentional conscious decision
To Zion, we're marching through with African Mayans
Conquering Babylon with the heart of a lion
And the walls of Jericho come a-tumbling down
Tell me, how long has it been
Is everything, everything alright my friend

You see, time is passing, people asking how come none of this ain't lasting
Money will make people deal like they don't even have to feel
But no, it ain't real, it ain't real

Oh, do you like the way that it's going down
Do you like the way that it's going down
Ooh, do you like the way

How long, how long will we wait, to sit down and communicate
See, everything is relative, if you want to get then give
Can't we all just build and live,can't we, can't we?

Do you like the way that it's going down
Do you like the way that it's going down
Do you like the way that it's going down
Do you like the way that it's going down
I was cutting the rug down at a place called The Jug
With a girl named Linda Lou
When in walked a man with a gun in his hand
And he was looking for you-know-who
He said, "Hey there fellow with the hair colored yellow
Whatcha tryin' to prove?
'Cause that's my woman there and I'm a man who cares
And this might be all for you"

I was scared and fearing for my life
I was shakin' like a leaf on a tree
'Cause he was lean, mean, big and bad, Lord
Pointin' that gun at me
"Oh, wait a minute, mister, I didn't even kiss her
Don't want no trouble wit' chu
And I know you don't owe me but I wish you would let me
Ask one favor from you"

"Won't you give me three steps, gimme three steps, mister
Gimme three steps towards the door?
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, mister
And you'll never see a-me no more"
For sure
Well, the crowd cleared away and I began to pray
And the water fell on the floor
And I'm telling you son, well it ain't no fun
Staring straight down a forty-four
Well, he turned and screamed at Linda Lou
And that's the break I was looking for
And you could hear me screaming a mile away
As I was headed out towards the door

"Won't you give me three steps, gimme three steps, mister
Gimme three steps towards the door?
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, mister
And you'll never see a-me no more"
Show me the back door
Come to decide that the things that I tried
Were in my life just to get high on
When I sit alone, come get a little known
But I need more than myself this time

Step from the road to the sea to the sky
And I do believe that we rely on
When I lay it on, come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice

Hey oh
Listen what I say oh
I got your hey oh
Now listen what I say oh, oh

When will I know that I really can't go
To the well once more, time to decide on
When it's killing me, when will I really see
All that I need to look inside

Come to believe that I better not leave
Before I get my chance to ride
When it's killing me, what do I really need
All that I need to look inside
Hey oh
Listen what I say oh
Come back and hey oh
Look at what I say oh

The more I see, the less I know
The more I like to let it go
Hey oh, woah

Deep beneath the cover
Of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow

Privately divided
By a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go

In between the cover
Of another perfect wonder
And it's so white as snow

Running through the field
Where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go

When to descend, to amend for a friend
All the channels that have broken down
Now you bring it up I'm gonna ring it up
Just to hear you sing it out
Step from the road to the sea to the sky
And I do believe what we rely on
When I lay it on, come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice

Hey oh
Listen what I say oh
I got your hey oh
Listen what I say oh

The more I see the less I know
The more I like to let it go
Hey oh, woah

Deep beneath the cover
Of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow

Privately divided
By a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go

In between the cover
Of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Running through the field
Where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go

I said hey, hey, yeah
Oh yeah, tell my love now
Hey, hey, yeah
Oh yeah, tell my love now

Deep beneath the cover
Of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow

Privately divided
By a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go

Deep beneath the cover
Of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow

Running through the field
Where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go

I said hey, oh yeah
Oh yeah, tell my love now
Hey, yeah, yeah, oh yeah
Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Nighttime would find me in Rosa's cantina
Music would play and Felina would whirl

Blacker than night were the eyes of Felina
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was deep for this Mexican maiden
I was in love but in vain I could tell

One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina, the girl that I loved

So in anger I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor
Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance, and that was to run
Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I caught a good one, it looked like it could run
Up on its back and away I did ride

Just as fast as I could from the West Texas town of El Paso
Out to the badlands of New Mexico

Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life, nothing is left
It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death
I saddled up and away I did go
Riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet will find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart

I can see Rosa's cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Felina I go

Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me
I have to make it to Rosa's back door
Something is dreadfully wrong, for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
I'm getting weary, unable to ride

But my love for Felina is strong and I rise where I've fallen
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

From out of nowhere Felina has found me
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss, then Felina goodbye
Every night was long and gloomy, shadows gathered in the air
No one ever listened to me, no one wondered did I care
None in all the world to love me, none to count that stars that hung
Then the moon came out above me and I saw that it was young

I wished on the moon for something I never knew
Wished on the moon for more than I ever knew
A sweeter rose, a softer sky
An April day that would not dance away

I begged of a star to throw me a beam or two
Wished on a star and asked for a dream or two
I looked for ev'ry loveliness, it all came true
I wished on the moon for you
Movin' up and down the street
You can catch up with the low down
It's gettin' hot, take the heat
But somehow we're gettin' over now
Gettin' over, yeah, baby
Everybody's tryin'
You'll get over, yeah
Everybody's gettin' over
On the mark, are you ready?
'Cause I am, baby, to get over
Gettin' over
Go for it all, you've got nothin' to lose
Just try to break through
Pull out the stop reach for the top
And I'll bet you, you'll get over too
Gettin' over
Everybody's tryin'
You'll get over
Everybody's gettin' over
On the mark, are you ready?
'Cause I am, baby, to get over
Gettin' over
Go for it all, you've got nothin' to lose
Just try to break on through
Pull out the stop and reach for the top
And I'll bet you, you'll get over too
On the mark, are you ready?
'Cause I am, baby, to get over
Getting' over
Gettin' over, well, I have no doubt
That's what believin' is all about
Gettin' over, reachin' for the top
Dreamin', pullin' out all the stop
Gettin' over, gettin' over
Gettin' over, well, I have no doubt
That's what happenin' in the streets
Gettin' over, reachin' for the top
Though it's hard to take the lead
Gettin' over, gettin' over
Gettin' over

[Verse 1]
They try to tell us we're too young
Too young to really be in love
They say that love's a word
A word we've only heard
But can't begin to know the meaning of

[Verse 2]
And yet we're not too young to know
This love will last though years may go
And then someday they may recall
We were not too young at all

[Outro]
They say that love's a word
A word we've only heard
But can't begin to know the meaning of
And yet we're not too young to know
This love will last though years may go
And then someday they may recall
We were not too young at all
Blues stay away from me
Oh blues, why don't you let me be
Don't know why
You keep on haunting me

Love was never meant for me
Oh true love was never meant for me
Seem somehow
We never can agree

Life is full of misery
Oh dreams are like memories
Bringing back
The love that it used to be

Tears, so many I can't see
Oh yes, don't mean a thing to me
Oh, don't go by
Still I can be free

[Verse 1: Paul Williams]
That day, I first saw you, oh oh, passing by
I wanted, to know your name but I was much too shy
I was looking at you so hard
Until you must have had a hunch
So you came up to me and asked me my name, baby

[Chorus: Paul Williams + (The Temptations)]
You beat me to the punch (You beat me to the punch), yeah
You beat me to the punch, yeah (You beat me to the punch)
You beat me to the punch (You beat me to the punch)

[Verse 2: Paul Williams]
Oh, after, I had known you for it seems like a long, long time
I wanted, wanted to ask you would you please, please be mine
Whenever you came around, my heart would pound
So you must have had a hunch
So you came up to me and asked me to be yours, baby

[Chorus: Paul Williams + (The Temptations)]
You beat me to the punch (You beat me to the punch)
You beat me to the punch (You beat me to the punch)
You beat me to the punch (You beat me to the punch)

[Bridge: Paul Williams]
Oh, since I loved you
I thought you would be true
And love me so tender
I let my poor heart surrender
To you, yes I did
But I found out, beyond a doubt
One day, girl, you were a playgirl
To walk away and leave me so blue

[Verse 3: Paul Williams]
So I ain't gonna wait around for you to put me down
This time I'm gonna play my hunch
And walk away this very very day, yeah

[Chorus: Paul Williams + (The Temptations)]
And beat you to the punch (I'll beat you to the punch), baby
And beat you to the punch, yeah (I'll beat you to the punch), baby
I'll beat you to the punch
Ooh baby, I like kissin' you
Ooh baby, I like kissin'

I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, down, tongue you down
I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, tongue, tongue you down

I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, down, tongue you down
I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, tongue, tongue you down

Parlez-vous francais?
That's not the language I speak
But your body got me sayin' some things
That people in France don't speak

Take the elevator up to the 22nd level
That's where you meet me, babe
Girl, when you get up to the 22nd level
That's when the violin play
I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, down, tongue you down
I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, tongue, tongue you down

I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, down, tongue you down
I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, tongue, tongue you down

Shawty, go dumb I run her good 

[Incomprehensible]
Give her she got wisdom
I took my diamond off my pinky put it on her thumb
Now she can't close her mouth and when she smile
Bright as the sun

Lip service, room service
I walk in the club husbands get nervous
I don't mean to diss but I don't like to kiss
But you so fuckin' fine I took that rule off my list

She walked in kissed the hottest rapper on his lips
I took a picture of my dick and sent it as a gift
Jamie the entertainer, Gucci the idiot
She came to the house start kissin' it immediate
I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, down, tongue you down
I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, tongue, tongue you down

I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, down, tongue you down
I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, tongue, tongue you down

As a matter of fact I got a better sensation
If you let me do that I got a stronger rotation
'Cause so many guys ruin the pleasant surprise

Take the elevator up to the 22nd level
That's where you meet me, babe
Girl, when you get up to the 22nd level
That's when the violin play

Watchin' you go up the staircase
Got me imaginin' some of the craziest ideas
Of you and me makin' love

Girl somethin' on your mind
But you ain't gotta say it
There's a chance you wanna take
And you gon' have to take it
And there's a blueprint to a girl
For she standin' naked
Damn you naked, you standin' naked
And damn there somethin' crazy about the way you say that

I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, down, tongue you down
I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, tongue, tongue you down

I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, down, tongue you down
I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, tongue, tongue you down

Only red roses for you, baby
And only white roses for you, baby

But I gotta keep it ghetto
Gotta keep my girl in stilettos
While she sittin' here singin' this demo
Sing it, sing it, parlez-vous francais?

I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, down, tongue you down
I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, tongue, tongue you down

I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, down, tongue you down
I don't speak French but I'll tongue you down, down
Tongue you down, tongue, tongue you down
I've got a sweet little angel
I love the way she spread her wings
Yes got a sweet little angel
I love the way she spread her wings
Yes, when she spreads her wings around me
I get joy, and everything

You know I asked my baby for a nickel
And she gave me a $20 bill
Oh yes, I asked my baby for a nickel
And she gave me a $20 bill
Whoah, you know I ask her to buy a little drink of liquor
And she gave me a whiskey still

Oh, if my baby should quit me
I believe I would die
Oh if my baby should quit me
Lord I do believe I would die
Yes if you don't love me little angel
Please tell me the reason why

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
Never too soon to be through
Bein' cool too much, too soon
Too much for me, too much for you
You're gonna lose in time
Every turn lookin' to burn
Some never learn, live and learn
Stop your searchin' for a curse
Before you end up in a hearse
Don't be afraid to show your friends that you hurt inside, inside
Pain's part of life, don't hide behind your false pride
It's a lie, your lie
Don't slip away and don't forget
I'll give you more than you can get
It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself
Come to me

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante & Vicki Calhoun]
If you see me gettin' mighty, if you see me gettin' high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me gettin' mighty, if you see me gettin' high (Ooh)
Knock me down (Knock me down)
I'm not bigger than life

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
I'm tired of bein' untouchable
I'm not above the love
I'm part of you, and you're part of me
Why did you go away?
Too late to tell you how I feel
I want you back, but I get real
Can you hear my fallin' tears
Makin' rain where you lay?
Findin' what you're lookin' for can end up bein', bein' such a bore
I pray for you, most every day
My love's with you, now fly away

[Chorus 2: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante, & Vicki Calhoun]
If you see me gettin' mighty, if you see me gettin' high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me gettin' mighty, if you see me gettin' high (Ooh)
Knock me down (Knock me down)
I'm not bigger than life

[Chorus 3: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante, & Vicki Calhoun]
If you see me gettin' mighty, if you see me gettin' high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me gettin' mighty, if you see me gettin' high (Ooh)
Knock me down (Knock me down)
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me gettin' mighty, if you see me gettin' high (Knock me, knock me, knock me)
Knock me down (Knock me down)
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me gettin' mighty, if you see me gettin' high (Knock me, knock me, knock me)
Knock me down (Knock me down)
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me gettin' mighty, if you see me gettin' high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me gettin' mighty, if you see me gettin' high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life

[Break: Vicki Calhoun]
Aah-aah-aah-aah-aah, hey, aah-aah-aah-aah, yeah, yeah
Aah-aah-aah-aah-aah, hey, aah-aah-aah-aah, yeah, yeah

[Outro: John Frusciante, Anthony Kiedis, & Vicki Calhoun]
It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself (Aah-aah, oh, oh, oh, hey, yeah)
It's so lonely
It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself (Oh, oh, oh-ooh-oh, oh, yeah)
It's so lonely
It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself
It's so lonely
It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself
I don't know why
We still live together
We're so far apart
So much of the time
I don't know why
This beautiful weather
Is breaking my spirit
And tearing my mind all apart

Are you so lonely
Are you so sad
Have you lost your purpose
The faith that you had
If life is a question
I don't understand
If time is the reason
Then nobody can

In my heart it is just an illusion
It's not even real
Much more than you think
It's much more than you feel
My ears are still ringing
There's nothing to say
Why look to the ocean
To wash me away
There goes my best friend
There goes my last dime
If love is the answer
I'm wasting my time

In my heart it is just an illusion
It's not even real
Much more than you think
It's much more than you feel
Do you feel
Is this real
How I feel
In my heart
Mother, I'm going to join the Air Force today
I don't care what the neighbors may say
But I'm going to join the Air Force today

Mother, I don't care what my father might think
Perhaps it's going to drive him to drink
But I don't care what my father might think

Don't ask me why, it's my mind and it's right
Don't ask me why, it's my mind
It's better, it's better than being alone
Alone on the ground, now I find

Mother, I've got to join the Air Force, you see
I've seen my friends and they all agree
That's it's better than joining the Army or going to sea

Mother, I've got to join the Air Force, you see
I've seen my friends and they all agree
That's it's better then joining the Army or going to sea
Mother
Mother
Mother
Now, when the day goes to sleep and the full moon looks
The night is so black that the darkness cooks
Don't you come creepin' around
Makin' me do things I don't wanna do

Can't believe that you need my love so bad
Come sneakin' around tryin' to drive me mad
Bustin' in on my dreams
Makin' me see things I don't wanna see

'Cause you're da Green Manalishi with the two prong crown
All my tryin' is up all your bringin' is down
Just takin' my love then slippin' away
Leavin' me here just tryin' to keep from followin' you
People talking but they just don't know
What's in my heart, and why I love you so
I love you, baby, like a miner loves gold
Come on, sugar, let the good times roll
Hey!

So many people live in make-believe
They keep a lot of dirt up their sleeves
But my love, baby, is no kind that folds
Come on, baby, let the good times roll
Hey!

Let the good times roll
Aw, let me, baby, come on and let Daddy fill your soul
Baby, let the good times roll

[Guitar Solo]

Oh, love is nice if it's understood
It's even nicer when you're feeling good
You got me flipping like a flag on a pole
Come on, sugar, let the good times roll
Hey!
Let the good times roll
Hey! Fill me, baby
I'm talkin' the good times roll
Come on and let me fill your soul
Hey, let the good times roll
You've got me dancing and cryin
Rollin and flying
Love don't let me go
You've got me drowning in a river
Cold but in fever
Love don't let me go
(Don't let me go)

Don't let me go
(Love don't let me go)
Don't let me go
(Don't let me go)
Don't let me go
(You've got me drowning in a river
Cold but in fever)
Eh, eh
Eh, eh

You've got me dancing and cryin
Rollin and flying
Love don't let me go
You've got me drowning in a river
Cold but in fever
Love don't let me go
You've got me dancing and cryin
Rollin and flying
Love don't let me go
You've got me drowning in a river
Cold but in fever
Love don't let me go
(Don't let me go)

Don't let me go
(Love don't let me go)
Don't let me go
(Don't let me go)
Don't let me go
(You've got me drowning in a river
Cold but in fever)
Eh eh
Eh eh
Don't let me go

You've got me dancing and cryin
Rollin and flying
Love don't let me go
You've got me drowning in a river
Cold but in fever
Love don't let me go
(Don't let me go)
Don't let me go
(Love don't let me go)
Don't let me go
Dancing and cryin(x3)
Eey
(Don't let me go)
Dancing and cryin(x3)
Eey
(Don't let me go)
This is my song for real, no doubt
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out
As I walk you to the dance floor
We begin to dance slow
Put your arms around me
I'm feelin' on your booty

Hey pretty mama how you doing?
Said I'm just in town for the weekend
Looking for a little trouble to get into
Baby tell me what you're drinking
And I got you, ooh

Playas wanna play
Ballers wanna ball
Rollers wanna roll
But I'm taking off after I dance, oh yeah

This is my song for real, no doubt
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out
As I walk you to the dance floor
We begin to dance slow
Put your arms around me
I'm feelin' on your booty
This is my song for real, no doubt
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out
As I walk you to the dance floor
We begin to dance slow
Put your arms around me
I'm feelin' on your booty

Now your body's got me feelin' like spending
With a backroom I could come to live in
And your hair weave looking kind of pretty
The way you back it up on me baby
God have mercy

Playas wanna play
Ballers wanna ball
Rollers wanna roll
But I'm taking off after I dance, yeah

This is my song for real, no doubt
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out
As I walk you to the dance floor
We begin to dance slow
Put your arms around me
I'm feelin' on your booty

This is my song for real, no doubt
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out
As I walk you to the dance floor
We begin to dance slow
Put your arms around me
I'm feelin' on your booty
If it's your birthday
Then put your hands up
You wanna get drunk
Then put your hands up
And if you got some cash
Then put your hands up
Have your own job
Put your hands up

Playas wanna play
Ballers wanna ball
Rollers wanna roll
Feel so good, say it again
Playas wanna play
Ballers wanna ball
Rollers wanna roll
But I'm taking off after I dance, oh yeah

This is my song for real, no doubt
Said the DJ's making me feel thugged out
As I walk you to the dance floor
We begin to dance slow
Put your arms around me
I'm feelin' on your booty
I know so many people who think they can do it alone
They isolate their heads and stay in their safety zone
Now what can you tell them?
What can you say that won't make them defensive?

Hang on to your ego
Hang on, but I know that you're gonna lose the fight

They come on like they're peaceful, but inside they're so uptight
They trip through the day and waste all their thoughts at night
Now how can I say it?
And how can I come on when I know I'm guilty?

Hang on to your ego
Hang on, but I know that you're gonna lose the fight

Now how can I say it?
And how can I come on when I know I'm guilty?

Hang on to your ego
Hang on, but I know that you're gonna lose the fight

[Intro]
You're so square, baby
You're so square

[Verse 1]
Oh, you don't like greasy diners
You don't like sleazy bands
You just want to go to a movie show
And sit there holding hands

[Chorus]
You're so square
Baby I don't care

[Verse 2]
You don't like going to parties
To toot and talk all night long
You just want to park where it's nice and dark
And kiss me sweet and strong

[Chorus]
You're so square
Baby I don't care

[Bridge]
You don't know any dance steps that are new
But nobody else can love me the way you do

[Verse 3]
I don't know why my heart flips
I only know it does
I wonder why I love you baby
I guess it's just because

[Chorus]
You're so square
Darlin' I don't care

[Verse 3]
Oh, I don't know why my heart flips
I only know it does
I wonder why I love you baby
I guess it's just because

[Chorus]
You're so square
I don't care
You're so square

[Lost Lyrics]

[Lyrics from "Brian Wilson presents Smile" (2004)]

[Intro]
(Water, water, water, water, ooh)

Is it hot as hell in here or is it me?
It really is a mystery

(Water, water, water, ooh)

If I die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take my misery

I could really use a drop to drink
Somewhere in a placid pool and sink
Feel like I was really in the pink

[Verse 1]
I lose a dream when I don't sleep
I'm slumbering
There's still a promise we must keep
I'm wondering

[Refrain]
Wa, wa, ho, wa (Hawaii)
Wa, wa, ho, wa (Hawaii, lay beyond the sea)
Wa, wa, ho, wa (Hawaii, Hawaii back to me)
Wa, wa, ho, wa (Hawaii, Hawaii)

[Verse 2]
Oh, I could use a drop to drink right now (In a waterfall, back there in Hawaii)
Take me to a luau now (Wa, wa, ho, wa)
And lay before me holy, holy cow (Wa, wa, ho, wa)

[Bridge]
(Down in blue Hawaii)
So far away from blue Hawaii (Wa, wa, ho, wa)
Aloha nui means goodbye (Hawaii, Hawaii)

[Our Prayer (Reprise) / Intro for Good Vibrations]
Need someone's hand to lead me through the night
I need someone's arms to hold and squeeze me tight
Now, when the night begins, whoa, I'm at an end
Because I need your love so bad

I need some lips to feel next to mine
Need someone to stand up - to stand up and tell me when I'm lyin'
And when the lights are low - and it's time to go
That's when I need your love so bad

So why don't you give it up, baby and bring it home to me
Or write it on a piece of paper, woman - so it can be read to me
Tell me that you love me - and stop drivin' me mad
Whoa, because I - I need your love so bad

Need a soft voice - just to talk to me at night
Don't want you to worry, baby
I know we can make everything alright
Listen to my plea, baby, come on bring it to me
'Cause I need - your love so bad
Baby, I need, I need - woman, I need your love so bad
Take me back
Hold my hand
All the way back
To the brotherland
Take me back
I want to go back

Take me back
And my funky ass band
All the way back
To the brotherland
Take me back

I want to go
As fast as I can
Slidin' on back
To the brotherland
Now children
Hollywood...

I want to get up and go
With my funky ass jams
All the way back
To the broherland
Take me back
I want to go back
Hollywood...

Where the women
Is the women
And the man
Is the man

I want to go
As fast as I can
Slidin' on back
To the brotherland
Now children
Tools was baby rabbit
He was a friend of mine
His mama and papa, brothers and sisters
Left him all behind

He came into our house
Brighten up a couple of days
Tools you made me smile a lot
And I wish you could have stayed

Tools was baby rabbit
He was a friend of mine
His mama and papa, brothers and sisters
Left him all behind

He came back our house
But only for a day or two
Tools you made me smile again
Then you made good rabbit stew
(Jimmy Webb)

Went to school In Cars, in our cars, pretty girls
Cruisin' after the game, watchin' radio
Let your baby know In Cars, restaurant mobile
Two behind the wheel like double-neck guitars
In our cars
We fell in love In Cars, in a car at the show
Silhouettes on the glass, memories in chrome
Take your baby home In Cars, everything was warm
What a perfect form underneath the stars
In our cars…
(I remember you, everything was new
Talking in the dark, everything was true.)
If you go when the snowflakes storm
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see she has a coat so warm
To keep her from the howling winds
If you're travelin' in the North Country fair
Where the winds get heavy on the border line
Remember me to one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine
Christmas like a lullaby steals across the land
A breeze upon the water, rainfall upon the sand
We celebrate a baby born from spirit into man
And Christmas like a lullaby steals across the land

It's morning in Australia; In fact it's Christmas day
And Colorado never seemed so very far away
Back where night has fallen and it's still Christmas Eve
And snow is on the mountains where I always hate to leave

Here I am down under with a brand new family
And Christmas bells are ringing
And there's presents 'neath the tree
I know that it's been said before and now I know it's true
That home is where the heart is
And Christmas lives there too
And on this morning Peace on Earth
Is still our fervent prayer
And I can hear it being
Whispered softly everywhere
And guns are called to silence
And anger called to still
And brotherhood and sisterhood
Surrounded by goodwill

Christmas like a lullaby steals across the land
A breeze upon the water, rainfall upon the sand
We celebrate a baby born from spirit into man
And Christmas like a lullaby steals across the land
A cigarette that bears a lipstick's traces
An airline ticket to romantic places
And still my heart has wings
These foolish things remind me of you

A tinkling piano in the next apartment
Those stumbling words that told you what my heart meant
A fairground's painted swings
These foolish things remind me of you

You came, you saw, you conquered me
When you did that to me
I knew somehow this had to be

The winds of March that make my heart a dancer
A telephone that rings but who's to answer?
Oh, how the ghost of you clings
These foolish things remind me of you

The smile of Turner and the scent of roses
The waiters whistling as the last bar closes
The song that Crosby sings
These foolish things remind me of you
I don't know what love is
But I think I must have it bad
Yeah, you know I don't know what love is people
Woah, but I think I must have it bad
Yeah, you know some people say love is just a gamble
But whatever it is, it's enough to drive old B. mad
They say love is just a proposition people
It's strictly a game of give and take
Yeah, they tell me love, love, love is a proposition people
They say it's strictly a game of give and take
Woah, but my woman took all I gave her
And I'm here to tell to you that love proposition stuff's a fake

Oh, I don't claim to be no gambler people
Oh, I don't know much about the dice
Yes, I don't claim to be no gambler people
I tell you I don't know much about the dice
Oh, but I wait and my baby knows
She knows I'm not the kind that's gonna crap out twice

Yes, she left me early this mornin'
I don't know the reason why
She just got up early this mornin'
Didn't even say goodbye
But I love you, I love you, you know I love you, baby
Although you made me cry
Yes, there are a lot of women who want me
Oh, but how you satisfy?
My song is a serious matter
It reflects what I feel
If I say I love you, I mean it
'Cause in my song
Every line is for real

Every man or woman
Enjoys going home
To a peaceful situation
To give love and receive love
Without any complications

Whether my tune is short or long
Whether my lyrics are weak or strong

I like to live the love
That I sing about in my song
I like to live the love
That I sing about in my song

Music is love
And my love is music
In perfect harmony
So when I sing
I have sung all about
The love of you and me
I never got angry with my guitar
'Cause when I strike a chord
It gives me what I wanna hear
So I'm finding out that
We are quite like my song together, my dear

Outside answers
Should always be forbidden
Problems should be solved
And never hidden

I like to live the love
That I sing about in my song
I like to live the love
That I sing about in my song
Texas are you my friend, you live so close to the end
Texas are you my friend, cause I'm afraid of you
Hey Maine hey, you're a little too high for me
And Fla you're just a little too low
D.C. you could be the end of me
I think I'm movin to Idaho
I ain't afraid of you
Oo, people on the outside lookin in
Mother Nature shakes, what then what then
Oo, people on the outside lookin through
She'll shake you to Idaho, that's what she'll do
Oo, Oo Carolina Brother's you make me crawl under the covers

Hey Joe I see your name too, but there is nothin that they can do
I think I'm movin to Idaho
I ain't afraid of you
Oo, people on the outside lookin in
Mother Nature shakes, what then what then
Oo, people on the outside lookin through
She'll shake you to Idaho, that's what she'll do Idaho

All over some dumb shit, ain't that some shit
Y'all niggas remind me of a strip club, 'cause everytime
You come around, it's like what I just gotta get my dick sucked
And I don't know who the fuck you think you talkin' to
But I'm not him, aight slim? So watch what you do
Or you gon' find yourself, buried next to someone else
And we all thought you loved yourself
But that couldn't have been the issue or maybe
They just sayin' that, now 'cause they miss you
Shit a nigga tried to diss you that's why you layin'
On your back, lookin' at the roof of the church
Preacher tellin' the truth and it hurts
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool up in here, up in here
Off the chain I leave niggas soft in the brain
'Cause niggas still want the fame, off the name
First of all, you ain't rapped long enough
To be fuckin' with me and you, you ain't strong enough
So whatever it is you puffin' on that got you think that you Superman
I got the kryptonite, should I smack him with my dick and the mic?
Y'all niggas is characters, not even good actors
What's gon' be the outcome? Hmm, let's add up all the factors
You wack, you're twisted, your girl's a hoe
You're broke, the kid ain't yours and everybody know
Your old man say you stupid, you be like so?
I love my baby mother, I never let her go
I'm tired of weak ass niggas whinin' over puss
That don't belong to them, fuck is wrong with them?
They fuck it up for real niggas like my mans and them
Who get it on on the strength of the hands with them, man
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool up in here, up in here
I bring down rains so heavy it curse the head
No more talkin' put him in the dirt instead
You keep walin' lest you tryin' to end up red
'Cause if I end up fed, y'all end up dead
'Cause youse a soft type nigga
Fake up north type nigga
Puss like a soft white nigga
Dog is a dog, blood's thicker than water
We done been through the mud and we quicker to slaughter
The bigger the order, the more guns we brought out
We run up in there, everybody come out, don't nobody run out
Sun in to sun out, I'ma keep the gun out
Nigga runnin his mouth? I'ma blow his lung out
Listen, yo' ass is about to be missin'
You know who gon' find you? Who? Some old man fishin'
Grandma wishin' your soul's at rest
But it's hard to digest with the size of the hole in your chest
Y'all gon' make me lose my mind up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool up in here, up in here

I come to Australia as many people do
To see the old koala, hitch a ride on a kangaroo
To hear somebody call me mate and call somebody blue
To hear the aboriginee play a didgeridoo

Some of you came as prisoners two centuries ago
Some of you come as kings and queens your blessing to bestow
Some of you stand all swelled with pride, some with shattered wings
But all of us come with open hearts to hear Australia sing

In the desert, in the city
In the mountains and in the sea
In the stories and in the people
I can hear Australia sing

Waltzing Matilda, the men of Galipoli
Clancy of the Overflow, Crocodile Dundee
The myth of all creation, the teaching of baiame
The legends of a dreamtime for all eternity

And in this celebration of a brief two hundred years
The cost to build a nation in blood and sweat and tears
And if we stand divided, divided we will fall
But if we stand together we shall conquer all
In the desert, in the city
In the mountains and in the sea
In the stories and in the people
I can hear Australia sing

Sing Australia, Sing Australia, Sing Australia, Sing Australia
In the sails on Sydney Harbour
I can hear Australia sing

[Repeat Chorus]
I'm closer to the Golden Dawn
Immersed in Crowley's uniform of imagery
I'm living in a silent film
Portraying Himmler's sacred realm of dream reality

I'm frightened by the total goal
Drawing to the ragged hole
And I ain't got the power anymore
No I ain't got the power anymore

I'm the twisted name in Goebbel's eyes
Living proof of Churchill's lies, I'm destiny
I'm torn between the light and dark
Where others see their targets in divine symmetry

Should I kiss the viper's fang
Or herald in the death of Man
I'm sinking in the quicksand of my thought
And I ain't got the power anymore

Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with death's release
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah
I'm not a prophet or a stone age man
Just a mortal with potential of a superman, I'm living on
I'm tethered to the logic of homo sapien
Can't take my eyes from the great salvation of bullshit faith

If I don't explain what you ought to know
You can tell me all about it on the next Bardo
I'm sinking in the quicksand of my thought
And I ain't got the power anymore

Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with death's release
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah

Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with death's release
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah
Frank duets with the girl 

[Girl singer]

[Wonder how I feel living on a hill top,]

[Looking on an ocean, beautiful and still,]
This is what I need, this is what I've longed for
Someone young and smiling, climbing up my hill

[We are not alike, probably I'd bore him]

[He's a cautious Frenchman, I'm a little hick]
Younger men than I, officers and doctors
Probably pursue her, she could have her pick

[Wonder why I feel jittery and jumpy,]

[I'm like a schoolgirl waiting before a dance]
Can I ask her now, I am like a schoolboy
What will be her answer, do I have a chance?

[music transition leading to the song Some Enchanted Evening]

[Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah... yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah] (x3)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah... yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey

Everybody keeps on talking about it... nobody's getting it done
I'm tired, tired, tired now of listening, listening... knowing that the ship's gotta run

[Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah... yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah] (x3)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah... yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey

Whispering while you cuddle near me
Whispering so no one can hear me
Each little whisper seems to cheer me
I know it's true, there's no one, dear, but you
Whispering why you'll never leave me
Whispering why you'll never grieve me
Whisper and say that you'll believe me
Whispering that I love you
Well, you wake up in the mornin'
And the ding dong rings
You go a marchin' to the table
You see the same old thing
Baby, all I want to tell ya
A knife, a fork and a pan
And if you say a thing about it
Your in trouble with the man

Let the Midnight Special
Shine a light on me
Let the Midnight Special
Shine it's everlovin' light on me
Yes, let the Midnight Special
Shine a light on me
Let the Midnight Special
Shine it's everlovin' light on me

If you're ever in Houston
Then you walk or ride
You better not gamble
And you better not skive, boy
'Cause sheriff Benson will arrest ya
He'll carry you on down
And if the jury finds you guilty
You're penitentiary bound
So, let the Midnight Special
Shine a light on me
Let the Midnight Special
Shine it's everlovin' light on me

Yonder comes miss Rosie
How I wonder did you know
Well, I know about apron
And the dress she wore
Umbrella on her shoulder
Piece of paper in her hand
She goes a-walkin' to the captain
Says, I'm losing my man

So, let the Midnight Special
Shine it's light on me
Let the Midnight Special
Shine it's everlovin' light on me
Let the Midnight Special
Shine it's light on me

[Verse 1]
Doomed from the start
We met with a goodbye kiss, I broke my wrist
It all kicked off, I had no choice
You said that you didn't mind 'cause love's hard to find

[Hook]
Maybe the days we had are gone, living in silence for too long
Open your eyes and what do you see?
No more laughs, no more photographs

[Chorus]
Turning slowly, looking back, see
No words, can save this, you're broken and I'm pissed
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock and roll sent us insane
I hope someday that we will meet again

[Verse 2]
Running wild
Giving it everyone, now that's all done

[Hooing, it can't be true
Maybe the days we had are gone, living in silence for too long
Open your eyes and what  you see?
ThNo more laughs, no more photographs

[Chorus]
Turning slowly, looking back, see
No words can save us, you're broken and I'm pissed
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock and roll sent us insane
I hope someday that we will meet again

You go your way and I'll go my way
No words can save us, this lifestyle made us
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock and roll sent us insane
I hope someday that we will meet again
All of your affection is gone baby and your love is growing cold
I've said all of your affection is gone baby and your love is growing cold
Hey, I've got a new story to tell you this evening, baby
One that ain't never been told

I went to work the other day
But I thought that I would double back
And that car I saw sitting in front of my door
Looked like a brand new, a brand new Cadillac, yeah!

I ain't got none now baby
I think you've been cheating on me
I believe to my soul baby, that you've given me some outside help
That I don't think I really need

The iceman came by this morning
And you know he didn't leave no ice
The postman came by later baby
And he didn't even ring twice

I think you've been cheating on me
I think you're running out on me
I believe to my soul baby, that you've given me some outside help
That I don't think I really need
Now, I want you to tell the iceman
The next time he'd better leave some ice
And I want you to tell the postman
He'd better ring more than twice

And when I come home from work in the morning
Better still be some groceries on the shelf
I want to tell that slick insurance man
That he'd better write some insurance on his self

Yes, I think you've been cheating on me
I think you're running out on me
I believe to my soul baby, that you've given me some help, some help
Some help, I don't really need
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair
She had good looks, God knows and coal black hair
Delilah, she gained old Samson's mind
When first he saw this woman, she looked so fine

Delilah she climbed up on Samson's knee
Said tell me where your strength lies, if you please
Then she spoke so kind, she talked so fair
That Samson said, Delilah, you cut off my hair
You can shave my head, cleanse my hand
My strength comes as natural as any other man

If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down
You read about Samson, all from his birth
He was the strongest man ever had lived on earth
One day while Samson was walking along
Looked down on the ground, he saw an old jaw bone
Then he stretched out his arm and his chains broke like threads
And when he got to move, ten thousand were dead

If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

Now Samson and the lion, they got in attack
And Samson, he walked up on the lion's back
You read about this lion, he killed a man with his paw
Samson got hands up round the lion's jaw
He ripped that beast, killed it dead
And the bees made honey in the lion's head

If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 1]
I'd rather be smoking weed whenever we breathe
Every time you kiss me
Don't say that you miss me
Just come get me

[Hook]
Don't know why, just know I want to
Don't know why, just know I want you

[Verse 2]
I'd rather be breaking things, cause we can't see
We're too busy kissing
Just making scenes, here come the police
They know about your history
How you live and love like "fuck rules"?
Don't care why, just know I love you

I woke up this morning, my baby was gone
Woke up this morning, my baby was gone
I've feel so bad, I'm all alone

I ain't got nobody, stayn' home with me
I ain't got nobody, stayn' home with me
My baby she's gone, I'm in misery

Well baby, I'm all alone
Yes baby, I'm all alone
I ain't had no lovin', since my baby's been gone
All right

Oh baby, I'm all alone
Oh baby, I'm all alone
My baby she's gone, I'm in misery

Oh baby, come on stay with me
Oh baby, come on stay with me
My baby she's gone, I'm in misery
Oh baby, I'm all alone
Oh baby, I'm all alone
I ain't had no lovin', since my baby's been gone

[Intro]
Ha ha, Kellz, I'm back, niggas
What, y'all thought I was gone?
Nope
Let's go

[Chorus]
(Rollin') Coming out them fruity colored candy doors
(Rollin') Catch me hopping up and down on 24's
Rollin' (hey)
I be rollin' (hey)
I be rollin' (hey)

(Rollin') When I was down, you bitches didn't wanna be my friend

[Verse 1]
I'm going toot toot, beep beep
Pulling up on them wheels now
All black Bugatti, and it's shining much like a seal now
And a shoty much like a seal now
Got them cars in my garage and no less than a mil now
Kellz about to take the bar and I'ma set it real high
Double take, double take when I roll up to the club
Players hate, players hate when I walk up in the club
I got them shades on doing about 75
Just call me Speed Racer 'cause I'm rollin' in at Mach 5
Y'all niggas ain't fucking with me and I put a mil on it
Niggas and bitches they lie, but homeboy, them stats don't
R&B Boss, hustling like Rick Ross
Man, my flow is so raw, so niggas, don't piss me off
I'm a player, homie, and that's a well-known factor
Plus the wheels on that coupe got it looking like a tractor
Take my ice, hold it up; then my city, toss it up
Chitown, summertime, Kellz got traffic backed up

[Chorus]
(Rollin') Coming out them fruity colored candy doors
(Rollin') Catch me hopping up and down on 24's
Rollin' (hey)
I be rollin' (hey)
I be rollin' (hey)
I be rollin' (hey)
(Rollin') When I was down, you bitches didn't wanna be my friend
(Rollin') And now I'm rollin', all you bitches wanna hop in
Rollin' (hey)
I be rollin' (hey)
I be rollin' (hey)
I be rollin' (hey)

[Verse 2]
Yellow ice, cash money, I got cash money
Just to hear them horses go (vroom), I spent that cash money
As for the haters, they ass funny
My money like a road block
So watch how you roll roll, you crash dummy
I'm rolling in, I roll and bounce, I roll and stop
Roll slow motion, then I let the beat drop
Honeys love it when I roll up on them wheels
Top down, looking fly, clownin' on them wheels
I got them 24's on that coupe, you know they chop and spin
I put an 'S' on my Maybach 'cause that's my Super Benz
I own a nightlight shining when I roll through
Hop out that Zerogi 101 color Smurf blue
Silver bullet Lex Jeep parked out at my beach home
Think I'm from the swamp the way I step out with them Gators on
On the hood of that old school, I be smoking trees on it
Just copped a Cadillac, I'm about to throw some D's on it

[Chorus]
(Rollin') Coming out them fruity colored candy doors
(Rollin') Catch me hopping up and down on 24's
Rollin' (hey)
I be rollin' (hey)
I be rollin' (hey)
I be rollin' (hey)
(Rollin') When I was down, you bitches didn't wanna be my friend
(Rollin') And now I'm rollin', all you bitches wanna hop in
Rollin' (hey)
I be rollin' (hey)
I be rollin' (hey)
I be rollin' (hey)

[Bridge]
Sh-sh-sh-shawty, do you wanna ride in that GT with me?
Sh-sh-sh-shawty, don't you wanna ride on them 23's?
Sh-sh-sh-shawty (hey) Sh-sh-sh-shawty (hey)
Sh-sh-sh-shawty (hey) Sh-sh-sh-shawty (hey)

[Chorus]
(Rollin') Coming out them fruity-colored candy doors
(Rollin') Catch me hopping up and down on 24's
Rollin' (hey)
I be rollin' (hey)
I be rollin' (hey)
I be rollin' (hey)
(Rollin') When I was down, you bitches didn't wanna be my friend
(Rollin') And now I'm rollin', all you bitches wanna hop in
Rollin' (hey)
I be rollin' (hey)
I be rollin' (hey)
I be rollin' (hey)

[Outro]
Kellz
I feel Hollyhood
It's raining cars, y'all
Birdman, I see you
Black June, I see you
Ha ha
As the bible is laid open
And the bread of life I find
In the words that you have spoken
Seal it in my heart and mind

Seal it in my heart and mind Lord
Seal it in my heart and mind
Let me always take it with me
Seal it in my heart and mind

I find prove of your forgiveness
And what wisdom there I find
And the strenght for daily living
Seal it in my heart and mind

Seal it in my heart and mind Lord
Seal it in my heart and mind
Let me always take it with me
Seal it in my heart and mind

Words of love and inspiration
Light to guide me when I'm blind
Keep me filled in preparation
Seal it in my heart and mind
Seal it in my heart and mind Lord
Seal it in my heart and mind
Let me always take it with me
Seal it in my heart and mind
Have you ever been (have you ever been) to electric ladyland?
The magic carpet waits for you so don't you be late
Oh, (I wanna show you) the different emotions
(I wanna run to) the sounds and motions
Electric woman waits for you and me
So it's time we take a ride, we can cast all of your hang-ups over
The seaside
While we fly right over the love filled sea
Look up ahead, I see the loveland, soon you'll understand
Make love, make love, make love, make love
The angels will spread their wings, spread their wings
Good and evil lay side by side while electric love penetrates the sky
Lord, lord I wanna show you
Hmm, hmmm, hmmm
Show you
There was a time when I loved you
That was a time, babe, you made me blue
There's a time ev'rything must end
So now it's time to say we're through

Remember the time, the time you made me cry
But now, baby, you break my heart
They say there's a time for everything, baby
So now it's time we must part

Remember the time, baby, you made me cry
And the time, baby, when you broke my heart
But there's a time for everything, baby
So now it's time we must part

They say that time brings about change
And I know, baby, I know it is no lie
There's times I got to forget you, baby
So it's time to say goodbye
Curled upon a contracted and drowsy exterior
Humming to Auntie Sheila my torment, my bother
She gives me chocolat lalalala lalalala
Humming to Auntie Sheila my torment, my horror
She gives me chocolat, it's far better than reasoning

Through a dance let go the grip
Link with the empty space

Enough there to create heat, replenish this place

Bon-bons bon-bons bon-bons
Better than reason
Sweeter than reason
Tell me everything
Don't be afraid to give yourself away
Sometimes, it's easier
Your fears melt away
And turn it all to moonshine
Words that rhyme
Still in your mind
Still in your mind

Play me anything
Maybe music is the only way
To tell me how you feel
Somehow, you'll find the way
And all the words to your song
Will carry on
Still in your mind
Still in your mind

[Verse 1]
Always hope that you remember
We'll never really learn the meaning of it all
What we have is strong and tender
So hold on
In the middle of the madness
When the time is running out and you're left alone
All I want is you to know that
It's strong still, can't pull us apart

[Chorus]
Nothing can come, nothing can come
Nothing can come between us
(Nothing can pull us apart)
Nothing can come, nothing can come
Nothing can come between us

[Verse 2]
I always hope that you remember
What we have is strong and tender
In the middle of the madness
Hold on
So it truly is a good thing
And I always wanted you to know
There is always this
And this is everlasting
Hold on

[Pre-Chorus]
It's about faith
It's about trust (Yeah, yeah)
It's about faith
It's about trust

[Chorus]
Nothing can come, nothing can come
Nothing can come between us
Nothing can come, nothing can come
Nothing can come between us
(Can't come) Nothing can come, nothing can come
(Can't tear) Nothing can come between us
(Can't pull) Nothing can come, nothing can come
(Us apart) Nothing can come between us
(Can't come) Nothing can come, nothing can come
(Can't tear) Nothing can come between us
(Can't pull) Nothing can come, nothing can come
(Us apart) Nothing can come between us
(Can't come) Nothing can come, nothing can come
(Can't tear) Nothing can come between us
(Can't pull) Nothing can come, nothing can come
(Us apart) Nothing can come between us
Well, some people love mambo
And so do I
The dance is kinda hard
So I don't think I'll try
I'll do the boogie
Yes, I'll do the boogie
Well, I'll do the boogie
'Cause I think it's much easier to do

Well , some people swing fast
Some swing it slow
It just knocks me out
To see my baby on the floor
I love to see her boogie
Yes, love to see her boogie
Well, I love to see her boogie
I think I'll try it a little bit too

Well, I swing her way out
Then pull her in close
I'm tellin' you, boys
That upsets me the most
I love to see her boogie
Yes, love to see her boogie
Well, it knocks me out to see her boogie
So, I think I'll try it a little bit too
Sleep warm, sleep tight, when you turn off the light
Sleep warm, sleep well, my love
Rest your head on your pillow, what a lucky pillow
Close to you, so close to you all night
Sleep warm, sleep well, let dreams within you dwell
Sweet dreams of me, my love
Close your eyes now and kiss me, and whisper you miss me
Sleep tight, sleep well, sleep warm
I'll wake each morning and I'll promise to laugh
I'll say "Good morning" to your old photograph
Then I'll speak to you, dear
Just as though you were here

When purple shadows start to welcome the dark
I'll take the same old stroll we took through the park
And I'll cling to you, dear
Just as though you were here

But I know so well that distance and time
Will finally tear us apart
The farther you go, the longer you stay
The deeper the doubts in my heart

Each night before I wander off into sleep
I'll bring to light the tears I've buried so deep
Then I'll kiss you, my dear
Just as though you were here

And when I hear a lonesome train, I'm afraid
I'll think of all those trips we never quite made
Fragile dreams that we planned
Then I'll reach for your hand
Just as though, just as though you were here
String-a-long, string-a-long, that's what I am
String-a-long, string-a-long, that's what I am

String-a-long - that's all I am is just your
String-a-long someone that you just seem to
Bring along, whenever you are all alone
And need some company you always turn to me

String-a-long - that's all I do is sort of
String-a-long you never seem to notice
I'm along although I hope and pray that
You will need me someday

All I ever do - is tag along with you
No matter where you chance to roam
I'm just satisfied - to be by your side
Here - there - near - far - I wanna be anywhere you are

Treat me wrong and maybe soon you'll lose your
String-a-long, someone may come and bring a
Love that's strong and wanna string-a-long with me
Break:

All I ever do - is tag along with you
No matter where you chance to roam
I'm just satisfied - to be by your side
Here - there - near - far - I wanna be anywhere you are

Treat me wrong - and maybe soon you'll lose your
String-a-long someone may come and bring a
Love that's strong and wanna string-a-long with me

I'll find somebody new - won't treat me like you do
I'll find somebody new - won't treat me like you do
I'll find somebody new - won't treat me like you do
When I was a child and I lived in the city
I dreamed of Alaska so far away
And I dreamed I was flying over mountains and glasciers
Somehow I knew that I'd live there one day

Well it took me some growin' and a fair bit of schoolin'
And a little bit of trouble to get on the move
And I felt like loser but I turned out the winner
When I came to Alaska the land that I love

Here's to Alaska here's to the people
Here's to the wild and heres to the free
Here's to my life in a chosen country
Here's to Alaska and me

I was born in a cabin on little Mulchatna
Raised in hard times but I had a good life
From the first time I flew with my father a singin'
I knew that I'd wind up a bush pilots wife

We sleep near the sound of a slow running river
And wake up most mornings to a drizzling rain
And we face every day like the first or the last one
With nothing to lose and heaven to gain
Here's to Alaska here's to the people
Here's to the wild and heres to the free
Here's to my life in a chosen country
Here's to Alaska and me

Oh for a fire on a cold winters night
And once more to gaze at the great Northernlights
For all of the beauty my children will see
Heres to Alaska and me

Here's to Alaska here's to the people
Here's to the wild and heres to the free
Here's to my life in a chosen country
Here's to Alaska and me
Hey Mathilda, Mathilda, Mathilda
She take my money and run, Venezuela
Five hundred dollars friends I lost
Poor man even sell my cab and horse
Matilda, she take my money and run Venezuela
Well the money was to buy my house and land
Then she got a serious plan
Well the money was just inside my bed
Stuck up in the pillow beneath my head
Well my friends never to love again
All my money gone in vain
I know a girl
She puts the color inside of my world
But she's just like a maze
Where all of the walls all continually change
And I've done all I can
To stand on her steps with my heart in my hands
Now I'm starting to see
Maybe it's got nothing to do with me

Fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

Oh, you see that skin?
It's the same she's been standing in
Since the day she saw him walking away
Now she's left
Cleaning up the mess he made

So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too
Boys, you can break
You'll find out how much they can take
Boys will be strong
And boys soldier on
But boys would be gone without warmth from
A woman's good, good heart

On behalf of every man
Looking out for every girl
You are the guide and the weight of her world

So fathers, be good to your daughters
Daughters will love like you do
Girls become lovers who turn into mothers
So mothers, be good to your daughters too

[Verse 1]
I say a prayer every night
Whatever I do, I'll get it right
With no regret, no guilt or shame
This time, no not this time
Once I surrender, I won't dare look back
'Cause if I do, I'll get off track
Move ahead in faith, and patiently await
Your answer what will it be

[Chorus]
Sight beyond what I see
You know what's best for me
Prepare my mind, prepare my heart
For whatever comes, I'm gonna be ready
Strength to pass any test
I feel like I'm so blessed
With you in control, I can't go wrong
'Cause I always know, I'm gonna be ready

[Verse 2]
I was free to do, what I wanted to
Lost everything, but I still had you
You showed me your grace, now my life's renewed
And I thank you, yes, I thank you
So I'll tell anyone who'll listen, I'll testify
About how good you were to me
When so call friends passed me by
The fact that you would show somebody
So broke down, so much mercy

[Chorus]
Sight beyond what I see
(Beyond what I see)
You know what's best for me
(I know, you know what's best for me)
Prepare my mind, prepare my heart
(Prepare my mind and prepare my heart)
For whatever comes, I'm gonna be ready
(For whatever comes, I gonna be ready)
Strength to pass any test
(Give me the strength to pass any test)
I feel like I'm so blessed
(I know that I'm so blessed)
With you in control, I can't go wrong
(You're in control Lord, can't go wrong no)
'Cause I always know, I'm gonna be ready
('Cause I know that I'm gonna be ready)

[Bridge]
So use me as you will, I'll pay the price
'Cause you made the ultimate sacrifice
It's all because of you, that I even have life
And I'll give my love, as a tribute, to how great you are

[Chorus]
Sight beyond what I see
(Beyond what I see)
You know what's best for me
(You know, you know what's best for me)
Prepare my mind, prepare my mind
(Prepare my mind and prepare my heart)
For whatever comes, I'm gonna be ready
(For whatever comes, I'm gonna be ready)
Strength to pass any test
(I wanna pass this test)
I feel like I'm so blessed
(I know that I am, know that I am, know that I'm so blessed)
With you in control, I can't go wrong
(You're in control of my life Lord, I can't go wrong no)
'Cause I always know, I'm gonna be ready
(And I know it, I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be ready)

[Outro]
I'm gonna be ready
(This time I'm gonna be)
I'm gonna be ready
('Cause you live deep inside of me)
I'm gonna be ready
(And I know it's in your will for me to be ready)
I'm gonna be ready
Well, every time that I come home nobody wants to let me be
It seems that all the friends I've got, just got to come, interrogate me
Well, I appreciate your feelings and I don't want to pass you by
But I don't ask you about your business, don't ask me about mine

Well, its true I love the money and I love my brand new car
I like drinkin' the best of whiskey and playin' in a honky tonk bar
But when I come off the road, well, I just got to have my time
'Cause I got to find a break in this action, else I'm gonna lose my mind

So, don't ask me no questions
And I won't tell you no lies
So, don't ask me about my business
And I won't tell you goodbye

That's right

Well, "What's your favorite color and do you dig the brothers"
Is drivin' me up a wall
And every time I think I can sleep, some fool has got to call
Well, don't you think that when I come home
I just want a little peace of mind
And if you want to talk about the business buddy, you just are wastin' time
So, don't ask me no questions
And I won't tell you no lies
So, don't ask me about my business
And I won't tell you goodbye

I said, don't ask no stupid questions
And I won't send you away
If you want to talk fishin'
Well, I guess that'll be okay

Hang all the mistletoe

Fireside is blazing bright
And we're carolin' through the night
And this Christmas will be
A very special Christmas for you and me

Hang all the mistletoe

Shake a hand, shake a hand

Baby, fireside blazing bright
Girl, everything is gonna be
Gonna be bright and nice
Country women now, what you gonna do with your life
Country women now, why don't you get out of this life
Leave my life alone
The first time I met you I knew you were the devil's daughter
You came on like a river, doin' all the things you oughta
You're a self made women, baby, not a made-to-order
If you had your way, I know you'd make me stay
And that would only bring me down

Country women now, what you gonna do with your life
Country women now, why don't you get out of this life
Leave my life alone

Country women, country women, country women
Country women, country women, ahh...

Country women now, what you gonna do with your life
Country women now, why don't you get out of this life
Leave my life alone
Leave my life alone
Country women now, country women now, country women now
Country women now, country women now, country women now
I was cleaning up
Putting stuff away
When I found it there yesterday
It was late you were drinking
The picture was dark and we both were blinking
I want you back today
I thought you left your toothbrush here
As a way to say Ill always be messing with you
I just remembered that time at the market
You snuck up behind me and jumped on my shopping cart
And rolled down aisle five
You looked behind you to smile back at me
Crashed into a rack full of magazines
They asked us if we could leave
I can't remember what went wrong last September
Though I'm sure you'd remind me if you had to
Our love was comfortable and so broken in
I sleep with this new girl I'm still getting used to
My friends all approve
Say "she's gonna be good for you"
They throw me high fives
She says the Bible is all that she reads
And prefers that I not use profanity
Your mouth was so dirty
Life of the party and she swears that she's artsy
But you could distinguish Miles from Coltrane
Our love was comfortable and so broken in
She's perfect
So flawless
Or so they say
So they say
She thinks I can't see the smile that she's faking
And poses for pictures that aren't being taken
I loved you
Grey sweatpants
No makeup
So perfect
Our love was comfortable and so broken in
She's perfect
So flawless
I'm not impressed
I want you want you want you back want you want you back
While I'm away, darling
How often do you think of me?
Remember, I'm over here
Fighting to keep us free
Just be my little girl and always be true
And I'll be a faithful soldier boy to you

They say I'm now a man and should be spotted hard
But I don't think I'll make it, dear
If you don't play your part
Just say you'll be my girl and always be true
And I'll be a faithful soldier boy to you

Soldier boy to you
We all must do our share
And darling, I don't mind
The only thing that's greed in me is leaving you behind

Just say you'll be my girl and always be true
And I'll be a loving soldier boy
I'll be a faithful soldier boy
I'll be a loving soldier boy to you
Ah, because I'm not crazy, jealous, baby
It don't mean that I don't care
Ah, because I'm not crazy, jealous, baby
It don't mean that I don't care
Yes, because if you keep messin' up with me, darling
I tell you, they're gonna miss you around here

Yes, because I try to play cool, baby
Yes, you seem to think that I'm a fool
Yes, because I try to play it cool, woman
You seem to think that I'm a fool
Yes, but I'm gonna tell you my dear
Oh baby, they gonna miss you around here

Yes, you might as well stop your horses
Turn your wagon around
I know what's on your mind
And I ain't goin' for what your puttin' down
Oh, I played it cool, baby
And you seem to think I'm a fool
Yes, but I'm gonna tell you my dear
That they gonna miss you around here
Yes, stop your horses, turn your wagon around
I know what's on your mind
I ain't goin' for what your puttin' down
Because I play it cool, baby, don't mean that I'm a fool
Yes, I'm gonna tell you, baby
They gonna miss you around here

I'll never forget you
I'll never forget you
I'll never forget how we promised one day
To love one another forever that way
We said we'd never say, "Good-bye"

But that was long ago
Now you've forgotten, I know
No use to wonder why
Let's say farewell with a sigh
Let love die

But we'll go on living
Our own way of living
So you take the high road and I'll take the low
It's time that we parted, it's much better so
But kiss me as you go, good-bye

But that was long ago
Now you've forgotten, I know
No use to wonder why
Let's say farewell with a sigh
Let love die
But we'll go on living
Our own way of living
So you take the high road and I'll take the low
It's time that we parted, it's much better so
But kiss me as you go, good-bye
Good-bye
Good-bye
This is my solo...Excuse me Sir...would you please take your seat, I'm playing my solo... no I'm serious can't you see I'm playing a solo here?...Hey buddy sit down so I can concentrate on my solo....Ok that's it, you would think that an artist could play a solo once in a while without any interuptions. Here...you take my guitar and show us what is so important...What? You work here, you're the usher? Oooook, sorry , soooo I'll just play my solo then
Young Pegi just died today
Young Pegi just died today
And I guess nobody even knows the case
But the way the story goes
She just ran out of clothes
No will this world
Just for the peg down
Last words, can't talk
And then she wrote

Some people can't stand no rain
Some people can't stand no rain
When it's cloudy outside
You can't see the sun
But on a bright and sunny day
The people all go away
Except one
Oh no don't pity me babe
I know I'm alright
O yeah, I'm alright
Don't see no tears around me
Don't see no tears around me
I don't take too much stock
In the things people say
I'm not saying that they're wrong
They've just been standing around too long
Gone bad
Oh no, don't pity me babe
I know I'm alright
O yeah, I'm alright

Can't ride my broom no more
Can't ride my broom no more
'Cause the landlady's taken
To sweeping the floor
I guess I'll go back to my place
And occupy a little space
John Doe
Oh no, don't pity me babe
I know I'm alright
O yeah, I'm alright

The streets are crammed, can't walk
Might find somebody and talk
I can't find nobody who
Say boo, guess who
'Cause that street is paved with aires
And everybody is putting on theirs
Can't breathe
Oh no, don't pity me babe
I know I'm alright
O yeah, I'm alright
He's standing outside my door
He's standing outside my door
But he won't ring the bell
And he's just to scared to knock
And he's puzzled
And he's young
And he's doing what's already been done
One more
Oh no, don't pity me babe
I know I'm alright
O yeah, I'm alright

Oh no, don't pity me babe
I know I'm alright
There was Adam, happy as a man could be
Till Eve got him messin' with that old apple tree

Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
They'll do it every time

Lot took his wife down to the corner for a malted
She wouldn't mind her business, boy, did she get salted

Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
They'll do it every time
Samson thought Delilah was on the square
Till one night she clipped him all his hair

Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
They'll do it every time
From our history books we all learned
Nero fiddled while Rome was burned

Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
They'll do it every time

Marie Antoinette met some hungry cats at the gate
They was crying for bread, she said, "Let them eat cake"

Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
They'll do it every time

You can buy a woman clothes
And give her money on the side
No matter what you do
She ain't never satisfied
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
Ain't that just like a woman?
They'll do it every time
Hand in glove
The sun shines out of our behinds
No, it's not like any other love
This one is different - because it's us

Hand in glove
We can go wherever we please
And everything depends upon
How near you stand to me

And if the people stare
Then the people stare
Oh, i really don't know and i really don't care

Kiss my shades ... oh ...

Hand in glove
The good people laugh
Yes, we may be hidden by rags
But we've something they never have
Hand in glove
The sun shines out of our behinds
Yes, we may be hidden by rags
But we've something they never have

And if the people stare
Then the people stare
Oh, i really don't know and i really don't care

Kiss my shades ... oh ...

So, hand in glove i stake my claim
I'll fight to the last breath

If they dare touch a hair on your head
I'll fight to the last breath

For the good life is out there somewhere
So stay on my arm, you little charmer

But i know my luck too well
Yes, i know my luck too well
And i'll probably never see you again
I'll probably never see you again
I'll probably never see you again
Oh ...

[Verse 1]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

[Verse 2]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

[Verse 3]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

[Verse 4]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
May all your Christmases
May all your Christmases
May all your Christmases be white

[Outro]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas with you
Jingle bells all the way, all the way
Grab a seat
Have something to eat
Help yourself, it's all right
If you want a beer, they're over here
But we only got Coors light
Try a chip with my homemade dip
The stuff is outa sight
Right before bed, we'll shave your head
It's a good thing you're dressed in white

Cos it's a Klan Kookout
Cos it's a Klan Kookout

Here's my wife, slash sister
She brightens up my day
She went away and I missed her
Cos my Mum's a lousy lay
Don't hang with foreign fellows
It'll only be your loss
Stay here and roast marshmallows
Beside the burning cross
At the Klan Kookout
Just the black people
Klan Kookout
Dad's on lookout
At the Klan Kookout

And if you're black
Don't want to see your face
They're like a high school track
Just a stupid race
We got a plan
Kill all the Jews
Are you a Mexi-can
Because you seem confused
(Señor, KKK?)

It's a Klan Kookout
It's a Klan Kookout
Mein Kampf?
Check that book out
At the Klan Kookout

All men are created equal
Man that shit gets me pissed
Here's an idea for a sequel
Someone loses Schindler's List
I cook, I clean
Cos I'm the hooded host
And on Halloween
I dress as a ... slave owner
We hate Hispanics
Hence the 20-foot walls
And all you God-damn dirty Catholics
Can Catho-lick my balls
Ethnics give off weird aromas
And I can't understand
Why we need High School Diplomas
With a Bible in hand

At the Klan Kookout
I have black friends
I was just kidding. I don't have black friends
White light - White light gonna drive me out of my brain

Don't turn on, be dead or alive
No feeling
Here she comes
Oww, yeah

(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
We ought to bake a sunshine cake
It does more good than a big thick steak
Start with a tablespoon of trouble
Then add a smile and let it bubble up

We ought to bake a sunshine cake
It isn't really so hard to make
Fresh tears, a pound or two of pleasure
Kind words, you needn't use a major cut

It's not from a recipe book
You don't have to be a good cook
Or run to the oven and look
With such a simple dish, all you do is wish

So why not bake a sunshine cake
Of course it may keep your dreams away
Friends say there's nothing like the flavor
Don't wait to do your friends a favor
And for goodness sake
Let's bake a sunshine cake
It's got vitamins A, vitamins B
Vitamins L-O-V-E
If you're fat, it's for that, if you're thin, stuff it in
What's wrong if you get a double grin
We ought to bake a sunshine cake

It's not from a recipe book
You don't have to be a good cook
Or run to the oven and look
With such a simple dish, all you do is wish

So why not bake a sunshine cake
Of course it may keep your dreams away
Friends say there ain't nothing like the flavor
Don't wait to do your friends a favor
And for goodness sake
Let's bake a sunshine cake
We had so many good times and some bad
We shared the happiness, shared the sad
We suffered all, all the miseries
Back when I had you girl you had me

But when you saw something fresh
You wanted next to your pretty little flesh
Like a sewer in the rain
It all went down the drain
You and I

My life is so empty, what can I do
I ain't got nobody hey nobody
To take the place of you
And I'm not so strong
Honey as I used to be
Back when I had you baby
And you had me

Then you saw something fresh
You wanted next to your pretty little flesh
Like a sewer when it rains
It all went down the drain
You and I
You and I
You played the game
Pick and choose
Yesterday I sang a love song baby
Now I'm singing the blues

And I'm not so strong
As I used to be
Back when I had you baby
You had me

But when you saw something fresh
You wanted next to your pretty little flesh
Like the sewer in the rain
It all went down the drain
You and I
For you and I

What can I do
What can I do
To take the place of you
Like a sewer when it rains
You know it all went down the drain
You and I
You and I
Mmm, you and I
They called it stormy Monday,but Tuesday is as just as bad
Oh, they called it, they called it stormy Monday, but Tuesday, Tuesday is as just as bad
Oh, Wednesday is worst And Thursday oh so sad

The eagle flies on Friday now, Saturday I'll go out to play
Oh, the eagle, the eagle flies on Friday Saturday I'll go out and play
Sunday I'll go to church, and I fall on my knees and pray

I say, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy on me
But Lord, Lord have mercy Lord have mercy on me

Sun rise in the east, it set up in the west
Yes, the sun rise in the east baby, and it set up in the west

Yeah! Go ahead Do it one more time
Oh, the eagle flies on Friday Saturday I'll go out to play

You know I'm crazy, crazy 'bout my baby
Please, send her back, send her back on to me

Yeah!
Put yourself in my place
If only for a day
See if you can stand
The awful hurt I feel inside

Put yourself in my place
For just a little while
Live through the loneliness
The endless emptiness
I go through

And when you lose a little sleep at night
Cause you ain't been treated right
Then you know heartaches are sad
Sitting by the telephone
Being left all alone
Then you know why I'm feeling bad
Put yourself in my place

And when you're just about to go insane
Cause it hurts to love in vain
Ask a girl who's been in love
I believed your evil line
Now I'm left alone and crying
Alone to count the stars above
Put yourself in my place
If only for a day
See if you can stand
The awful emptiness
I feel inside
Put yourself in my place

Put yourself in my place
For just a little while
Why don't you try it
Why don't you try it
Why don't you try it baby

[Verse 1]
Every day that goes by
Every moment you'll find
There's a broken heart
A tear is cried
A wish is made
That never comes true
And somewhere someone needs to be found

[Chorus]
The things we do, the things we say
Are gentle rays of hope that touch us all each day
The things we do, the things we say
These are the greatest gifts we'll ever give away
The things we do

[Verse 2]
Every day in this life
Every moment you'll find
A heart is healed
A dream is found
A tear is dried
And laughter is heard
And somehow someone's life will be changed by

[Chorus]
The things we do, the things we say
Are gentle rays of hope that touch us all each day
The things we do, the things we say
These are the greatest gifts we'll ever give away
The things we do

[Bridge]
Oh every hand that has been held
Has reached out for somebody else
In every move we make
Every day
We pass love on this way

[Chorus]
The things we do, the things we say
Are gentle rays of hope that touch us all each day
The things we do, the things we say
These are the greatest gifts we'll ever give away
The things we do
There's a fox on the hill
And he's standing still
As if he's trying to hide

My horse is going after him
He thinks he'll easily catch him
But the Tod is sly

Lazy days and crazy ways
The sun is high and I'm feelin' fine
(and so is ol' Dart)

My horse is unconcerned
As he takes a tricky turn
On the heels of the fox

But as we come around
Mr. Tod is off the ground
Smiling down from the rocks

Crazy days and lazy ways
The sun is nigh and I'm feelin' high
(it's only rock and roll)
"Well, I'm an artful dodger"
Said the fox
"they never catch me, no!
I lead them all a merry dance"

"I see you're on a pleasure run
Out to have a bit of fun...
Perhaps you'd like a game of chance?"

"So may I propose a little game
...if you'll agree
I wager you'll never catch me!"
And in a flash
The fox flipped his tail
My horse took the bit
And the chase was on...

Now we're back on the hill
We're going faster still
And we're nose to nose

Well my horse is going faster
But the fox is going past us
Laughing as he goes!

Crazy daisy, lazy crasy
Matching Mole; a toad in the hole;
(it's only fox and foal)
I'm just a happy fox and clearly
You're just foal at heart
I hope we meet again
You've made me
Oh, such a happy fox
Cheerio!
We gonna get high baby, we gonna get real high..
Wam, Bam, Thank you mam'
Airport stress, the name of this jam
Just keeps on bumpin
Blunts i'm sparkin
Three hours early can't find no parkin
Ticket agent mad cuz I'm flagrant
Hostile.. Smoke comin out my nostril
Sick of paying airlines to disrespect me
Let me guess, did the FAA select me
I ain't caring man
FAA stands for Fuck African Americans (Really though)
I don't plant no bombs on children (Really though)
I don't fly no planes into buildings (Really though)
My luggage is the first you grab
But what about this arab?(Calm Down)
Take off my shoes
I suppose that's fine
But it's your nose, not mine
Man i'm sick of the -
(Chorus)
Airport, The way i travel round (Bagcheck)
Wish I, could keep my feet on solid ground (Random Search)
Always, wanted to be a super star (Spread Your Legs)
Now I, rather go home and drive my car (Check it again)
The pilot, is a pencil neck geek
The stuckup stewardess, never speaks
Look honey, don't start no shit
You don't like your job? Quit
I take a world, a cover
Don't talk no job
Have colt 45 next time i arrive
Pretzels, Peanuts, Carrots, Cabbage
Dude, who came up with this food
Sittin in the middle is harmless
Unless the fat people don't share the armrest
Am i scared? A little, man
Especially when im flyin on a, little plane
Shiverin Shakin
Quiverin Quakin
Staggerin Stoppin
No warnin just droppin
Get more thoughts on my casket yall
Bounce down the runway like a basketball

(Chorus)
It's on your face
You can't hide it
Your bag don't fit in space provided
Sir! you need to check that in
Walk through security once again
The plane parked at the gate
People jump up cuz they just can't wait
Everybody can't make it to the aisle
So they stand underneath that uh for a while
I just sit in my seat and think
Oh my lord
I really feel sorry for your spinal chord
Money, Greed, Creates the need
For people to travel with speed
Save more time
Make more cash
But what good is the cash
If the airplane crash
Flyin is faster, but i don't care
I got the rest of my life to get there
(Chorus)(Modified)
Cadillac, the way I travel round
Movin and groovin to the sound
If I go over seas I will choose
The love boat, and take a fucking cruise
So they gonna random select me about three or four times
At the counter, at the security check point, and at the gate
Then, naw, it get better, it get better
Then, they got like these undercover airport cop
That just come out the blue and just empty yo bag out right in the middle of the aisle.....
Calling sister midnight
You've got me reaching for the moon
Calling sister midnight
You've got me playing the fool
Calling sister midnight

Calling sister midnight
Can you hear me call?
Can you hear me well?
Can you hear me at all?

Calling sister midnight
Well, I'm an idiot for you
Calling sister midnight
I'm a breakage inside
Calling sister midnight

Calling sister midnight

You know, I had a dream last night
Mother was in my bed
And I made love to her
Father he gunned for me
Hunted me with his six gun
Calling sister midnight
What can I do about my dreams?

Listen to me, sister midnight
You've got me walking in rags
Listen to me, sister midnight
You put a beggar in my heart

Hey, where are you sister midnight?
Can you hear me call?
Can you hear me well?
Can you hear me at all?
I'll take you home again Kathleen
Across the ocean wild and wide
To where your heart has ever been
Since first you were my pleasent bride
The roses all have left your cheek
I watch them fade away and die

Your voice is sadden when you speak
And tears bedim your loving eyes
Oh, would I will take you back Kathleen
To where your heart will feel no pain
And when the fields are fresh and green
I will take you to your home again
Johnny Todd he took a notion
For to cross the ocean wide
And he left his love behind him
Walkin' down by the Liverpool tide

For a week she wept full sorrows
Tore her hair and wrung her hands
Till she met another sailor
Walkin' down by the Liverpool sands

Why fair maid are you a-weeping
For your Johnny gone to sea?
If you wed with me tomorrow
I'll be by you constantly

I will buy you clothes and blankets
I'll buy you a wedding ring
You shall have a gilded cradle
For to rock you baby in

Johnny Todd came home from sailin'
Sailin' on that ocean wide
And he found his fair and false one
Was another sailor's bride
Now, all you men who go a-sailing
For to fight the foreign foe
Never leave, never leave love like Johnny
Marry her before you go

[Chorus]
I was born in a desert
Raised in a lion's den
I was born in a desert
Raised in a lion's den
And my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men

[Verse 1]
Well I'm a wanted man in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good
Well I'm a wanted man in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good
Well the sheriff couldn't catch me
But his little girl sure wished she would

[Verse 2]
Yes and the doctor call me crazy, some says I am some says I ain't
Yes and the doctor call me crazy, some says I am some says I ain't
The preacher man call me a sinner, but his little girl call me a saint

[Verse 3]
Well a couple of shots of whiskey, women round here start lookin' good
Well a couple of shots of whiskey, women round here start lookin' good
Couple more shots of whiskey, I'm goin' back to Minglewood
TT: I'm just a little ole girl

Ow, people gather round me, it's to whom it may concern
I'm not trying to run your life but you're never too old to learn
Stop worrying about your neighbors and the fancy things they got
'Cause if you do you'll find it sure you're gonna wind up on the spot, ow
Don't let the Joneses, don't let the Joneses, don't let the Joneses
Just get you down, oh down, one more time
Don't let the Joneses, don't let the Joneses, don't let the Joneses
Just get you down, oh down
Oh, you may not believe it but nine times out of ten it's true
The people you're trying to keep up with are trying to keep up too
Remember that old saying, 'All that glitters ain't gold'
Take heed, don't ignore it until your money time will hold
Ow, don't let the Joneses, don't let the Joneses, don't let the Joneses
Just get you down, oh down, hear me now, now
Don't let the Joneses, don't let the Joneses, don't let the Joneses
Just get you down, oh down
You're lying to yourself but you don't even know it
You're so busy following the Joneses you ain't got time to show it
Keeping up with the Joneses as it will make your life a mess
Bill collectors, tranquilizers and getting deeper in debt
You better leave the Joneses alone, tell 'em one more time
You better leave, oh leave the Joneses alone
Joneses got a new car today, here's what you should say
Hooray for the Joneses
Instead you worry till your whole head turns gray
Worry about the Joneses
Remember it's their car and they're the ones who had to pay
So leave Jo-Jo-Joneses alone
Listen your car might be old but remember it never fails
To get you where you wanna go
Oh, don't let the Joneses, don't let the Joneses, don't let the Joneses
Get you down, oh down, hear me now, now
Don't let the Joneses, don't let the Joneses, don't let the Joneses
Just get you down, oh down
You're doing fine
Don't let the Joneses get you down
Now listen, if you see something you want
And you know you can't afford it
The very next thing for you to do is start saving towards it
The Joneses are one in town for how many persons you see
So people take my advice and let the Joneses be, ow
Don't let the Joneses, don't let the Joneses, don't let the Joneses
Get you down, oh down, hear me now, now
Don't let the Joneses, don't let the Joneses
Don't let the Joneses, get you down, oh down
You're doing fine
Don't let the Joneses get you down
You're doing fine
Don't let the Joneses get you down
Mama asked me where I went and I said I went away
She asked me why I left and I told her I can't stay
There's debts I gotta pay
I might come back some day
Hopped in the back of the '95 chevy and drove it to the coast
Mom asked me if I got a job and I told her that I sell
Asked if she needed a few bucks at home and she told me "go to hell"
And I think I might as well
Till then I'll surf the swell
Hopped in the back of the 95 chevy and drove it to the coast
When you've got no more assurance
Than a great big hunk of lead
If you don't respond to romance
Jack, you're dead!

When a chick is smiling at you
Even though there's nothing said
If you stand there like a statue
Jack, you're dead!

You've been always kicking
But you stubbed your toes
When you ups and kicks the bucket
Just like old man Mose

When you get no kicks from loving
And you blow your top instead
It's a fact that you ain't living
Jack, you're dead!

If you just ain't got nobody
Since you've gone and lost your head
Rigor Mortis has set in daddy
Jack, you're dead!
What's the use of having muscles
When your life hangs by a thread
If you ain't got no red corpuscles
Jack, you're dead!
You've been always kicking
But you stubbed your toes
When you ups and kicks the bucket
Just like old man Mose

When you get no kicks from loving
And the news begins to spread
All the cats will holler, "Murder!"
Jack, you're dead!
All the breaths leaked out of you
When your friends gather round the bed
And look at you and say, "Um, um, um, don't he look natural"
When that happens to you, daddy
Jack, you're dead!
When is sometime?
How many days until sometime?
For my dreams make it clear that my lover is near
And she ought to be here about sometime

Who is someone?
Who is this wonderful someone?
Oh, I'm keeping my heart strings in tune
And hoping that sometime is soon

Who is someone?
Who is this wonderful someone?
Oh, I'm keeping my heart strings in tune
And hoping that sometime is soon
Hello

Can you hear me?
Now put your hands in the air

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Not like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all
Your Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Not like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases
May all your Christmases
May all your Christmases
May all your Christmases be white
I'm dreaming of a white
Christmas with you
Jingle Bells
All the way, all the way
A moment after dark around the park, an old-fashion gent comes parading
Dressed in funny clothes but singing as he goes, the lamplighter's serenade
The old boy loves to talk with couples on the walk, but when it's half after love time

He reaches for his stick and from his bag of tricks, he lights every star in the sky
And if a lady or a beau should answer no, he sprinkles their hearts with his magic
Then he steals away to sing another day, the lamplighter's serenade
Way back yonder in the days of old
The men was workin' but not savin' any dough
Then came a woman lookin' real cool
She said to herself "Now, that's my fool"
I'm gonna ball tonight
I'm gonna ball tonight
Well you can't break the rule becauses every man is some woman's fool

Met a girl on the avenue
She was shy and I was blue
Like a teacher and a student in the school
Looked at me and said "You're my fool"
Gonna ball tonight
We're gonna ball tonight
Man I can't break a rule cause every man is some woman's fool

Way back yonder in the days of old
The men was workin' but not savin' any dough
Then came a woman lookin' real cool
She said to herself "Now, that's my fool"
I'm gonna ball tonight
I'm gonna ball tonight
Well you can't break the rule becauses every man is some woman's fool

I'm gonna ball tonight
We're gonna ball tonight
We're gonna ball tonight
We're gonna ball tonight
Well I can't break the rule becauses every man is some woman's fool
Sometimes I'm right, but I can be wrong
My own beliefs are in my song
The butcher, the banker, the drummer and then
Makes no difference what group I'm in

'Cause I am everyday people, yeah yeah

There is a blue one who can't accept the green one
For living with a fat one trying to be a skinny one
Different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby dooby doo-bee
Ooh sha sha, we got to live together

I am no better and neither are you
We are the same whatever we do
You love me, you hate me, you know me and then
You can't figure out the bag I'm in

'Cause I am everyday people, yeah yeah

There is a long hair that doesn't like the short hair
For bein' such a rich one that will not help the poor one
Different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby dooby doo-bee
Ooh sha sha, oh yeah, we got to live together
There is a yellow one
That won't accept the black one
That won't accept the red one
That won't accept the white one

Different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby dooby doo-bee

'Cause I am everyday people
'Cause I am everyday people, yeah yeah yeah
'Cause I am everyday people
'Cause I am everyday people

[Verse 1]
It's time the tale were told
Of how you took a child
And you made him old

It's time the tale were told
Of how you took a child
And you made him old
You made him old

[Refrain 1]
Reel around the fountain
Slap me on the patio
I'll take it now
Oh...

[Chorus 1]
Fifteen minutes with you
Well, I wouldn't say no
Oh, people said that you were virtually dead
And they were so wrong
Fifteen minutes with you
Oh, well, I wouldn't say no
Oh, people said that you were easily led
And they were half-right
Oh, they ... oh, they were half-right, oh

[Verse 2]
It's time the tale were told
Of how you took a child
And you made him old

It's time that the tale were told
Of how you took a child
And you made him old
You made him old

[Refrain 1]
Oh, reel around the fountain
Slap me on the patio
I'll take it now
Ah... oh...

[Chorus 2]
Fifteen minutes with you
Oh, I wouldn't say no
Oh, people see no worth in you
Oh, but I do
Fifteen minutes with you
Oh, I wouldn't say no
Oh, people see no worth in you
I do
Oh, I ... oh, I do
Oh ...

[Verse 3]
I dreamt about you last night
And I fell out of bed twice
You can pin and mount me like a butterfly
But "take me to the haven of your bed"
Was something that you never said
Two lumps, please
You're the bee's knees
But so am I

[Refrain 2]
Oh, meet me at the fountain
Shove me on the patio
I'll take it slowly
Oh ...

[Chorus 3]
Fifteen minutes with you
Oh, I wouldn't say no
Oh, people see no worth in you
Oh, but I do
Fifteen minutes with you
Oh, no, I wouldn't say no
Oh, people see no worth in you
I do
Oh, I ... I do...
Oh, I do...
Oh, I do...
Oh, I do...
Little wendy cocaine stumbles up the hill to pain
Nothing stops the go-to girl, nothing takes the place of taking aim
Little wendy's out there shaking hips and cuckoo eyes
Crazy drives that dizzy crowd
Moonlight strokes the highlights in her hair

She sells and moves and finds my hand
And pulls me down and close so I can hardly stand
As I lay like dead for her, I'm fed into my head I'm led, oh, I am sand
I'm crawling from the window, crawling down the wall
I'm happy screaming, yes, I am
I'm jumping on her daisy chain
I'm speeding through the dancehall like a rocket man

Now I wish today that yesterday was just tomorrow and
I could squeeze her grabby hand
Knowing that I never paid her for a gram

She's a drunken doxy off her trolly
Sent before her time into this poxy world
She's not fit for anything but dealing it
While heaven sings, I have this girl
She's got me eating rice and beans
I have no shape nor color, I'm god's lonely man
I don't want to die but I don't want to live
I'm speeding like a rocket man
Like a rocket man
Like a rocket man
Like a rocket man
I love you because you understand, dear
Every single thing I try to do
You're always there to lend a helping hand, dear
I love you most of all because you're you
No matter what the world may say about me
I know your love will always see me through
I love you for the way you never doubt me
But most of all I love you 'cause you're you
No matter what may be the style or season
I know your heart will always be true
I love you for a hundred thousand reasons
But most of all I love you 'cause you're you
Well, my head is spinnin'
Like a spinnin' top
I got rhythm in my feet
And I really wanna hop
I wanna jump with you, baby
I wanna jump with you, baby
I wanna jump with you, baby
Babe, I mean tonight

I got money to waste
A car to drive
We'll go out and play
The joints a little while
I wanna jump with you, baby
I wanna jump with you, baby
I wanna jump with you, baby
Babe, I mean tonight

And we'll take in a show
And go to a dance
You won't be lonesome
'Cause I'll make romance
I wanna jump with you, baby
I wanna jump with you, baby
I wanna jump with you, baby
Babe, I mean tonight
Now wait, let's have a little taste
'Cause haste makes waste
We might wanna stop
At another little place
I wanna jump with you, baby
I wanna jump with you, baby
I wanna jump with you, baby
Babe, I mean tonight
Baby, I need your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'

Although you're never near
Your voice I often hear
Another day, another night
I long to hold you tight
'Cause I'm so lonely

Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'

Some say it's a sign of weakness
For a man to beg
Then weak I'd rather be
If it means havin' you to keep
'Cause lately I've been losin' sleep

Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Empty nights echo your name
Whoa, sometimes I wonder
Will I ever be the same?
Oh yeah

When you see me smile, you know
Things have gotten worse
Any smile you might see
Has all been rehearsed

Darlin', I can't go on without you
This emptiness won't let me live without you
This loneliness inside me, darlin'
Makes me feel half alive

Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'

Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
Baby, I need your lovin'
Got to have all your lovin'
I don't have to beg you to hold me
Cause somebody else will
You don't have to love me when I want it
Cause somebody else will
Your so called friends say you don't need it
When all the time they're trying to get it
Lookout
Your good thing is coming to an end
Your real good thing is about to end

All those nights I watched the four walls
I didn't have to watch them all alone
When another woman said she wanted me
I didn't have to tell her I was your very own
You've had all the love I've got
But even ice melts to water when it gets hot
Your good thing is coming to an end
I mean your real good thing is about to end

I'm getting myself back together
It's gonna be tough I know
But when the right woman comes along
You can bet I won't say no
Your real good thing
I said it's coming to an end
Your real real good thing
Is about to end
Your so called friends say you don't need it
When all the time they're trying to get it
Lookout
Your good thing is coming to an end
Talking about your real real good thing
Said it's coming to an end
Talking about the good thing
The real thing
Gonna be a brand new day
When your good thing goes away
Call me Mister gone gone gone gone gone away
You'd better have something going on
Cause your good thing is moving on

Talking about your good thing
Is coming to an end
January back in '55 we rode a Greyhound bus through the Georgia midnight
Grandpa was sleeping and the winter sky was clear
We hit a bump and his head jerked back a little and he mumbled something
He woke up smiling, but his eyes were bright with tears
Said, "I dreamed I was back on the farm...
20 years have passed, boy, but the memory still warms me...
Wildflowers in a Mason Jar..."
He told me those old stories about that one-room cabin in Kentucky
The smell of the rain and the warm earth in his hands
He slowly turned and stared outside; his face was mirrored in the window
And his reflection flew across the moonlit land
And he dreamed he was back on the farm

Tilts his head and listens to the early sound of morning
Wildflowers in a Mason Jar
An old man and an eight-year-old boy rolling down that midnight highway
Kentucky memories from a winter Georgia night
I started drifting off and Grandpa tucked his coat around me
I think I tried to smile as I slowly closed my eyes
And I dreamed I was with him on the farm
"Grandpa, I can hear the evening wind out in the corn...
Wildflowers in a Mason Jar...
Wildflowers in a Mason Jar...
Wildflowers in a Mason Jar..."
And the bus rolled through the night...

Oh baby, you know I may be a fool
I'm wastin' my time by goin' to school
The way you got me holdin' your door
I can't do my homework anymore
I can't do my homework anymore

Oh baby, I said you got me so blind
I'm walkin' 'round in circles, I could loose my mind
The way you got me holdin' your door
I can't do my homework anymore

Now baby your as sweet as you can be
Everything you do keep on sending me
Just the kiss of your lips or the touch of your hand
Everything you do is really grand

Oh baby, oh, now what can I do
I'm walkin' round in circles in love with you
The way you got me holdin' your door
I can't do my homework anymore
Now baby your as sweet as you can be
Everything you do keep on sending me
Just the kiss of your lips or the touch of your hand
Everything you do is really grand

Oh baby, oh, now what can I do
I'm walkin' round in circles in love with you
The way you got me holdin' your door
I can't do my homework anymore
I can't do my homework anymore
I can't do my homework anymore
I can't do my homework anymore
I can't do my homework anymore

[Verse 1]
She was Boston, I was Vegas
She was crepe suzette, I was pie
She was lectures, I was movies
But I loved her

[Verse 2]
She was Mozart, I was Basie
She was afternoon tea, I was saloon
She was Junior League, I was Dodgers
But I loved her morning, night and noon

[Bridge]
Opposites attract, the wise men claim
Still I wish that we had been a little more the same
It might have been a shorter war
If we had know each other more

[Verse 3]
She was polo, I was race track
She was museums, I was TV
She did her best to change me
Though she never, never knew quite how
But I loved her, almost as much as I do now

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 4]
She was Wall Street, I was pawn shop
She was French champagne, I was beer
She knew much more than I did
But there was one thing she didn't know
That I loved her, 'cause I never, never told her so
I-I love the colorful clothes she wears
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
I hear the sound of a gentle word
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air

I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations)

Close my eyes, she's somehow closer now
Softly smile, I know she must be kind
When I look in her eyes
She goes with me to a blossom world

I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations (Oom bop bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (Good vibrations, oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations)
(Ahh)
(Ah, my my, what elation)
I don't know where but she sends me there
(Oh, my my, what a sensation)
(Oh, my my, what elation)
(Oh, my my, what)

Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin' with her
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin'

(Ahh)

Good, good, good, good vibrations (Oom bop bop)
(I'm pickin' up good vibrations) (Oom bop bop)
She's giving me excitations (Excitations, oom bop bop)
Good, good, good, good vibrations

Na na na na na, na na na
Na na na na na, na na na (Bop bop-bop-bop-bop, bop)
Do do do do do, do do do (Bop bop-bop-bop-bop, bop)
Do do do do do, do do do (Bop bop-bop-bop-bop, bop)

[Verse 1]
I've nothing much to offer
There's nothing much to take
I'm an absolute beginner
And I'm absolutely sane
As long as we're together
The rest can go to hell
I absolutely love you
But we're absolute beginners
With eyes completely open
But nervous all the same

[Chorus]
If our love song
Could fly over mountains
Could laugh at the ocean
Just like the films
There's no reason
To feel all the hard times
To lay down the hard lines
It's absolutely true

[Verse 2]
Nothing much could happen
Nothing we can't shake
Oh we're absolute beginners
With nothing much at stake
As long as you're still smiling
There's nothing more I need
I absolutely love you
But we're absolute beginners
But if my love is your love
We're certain to succeed

[Chorus]
If our love song
Could fly over mountains
Sail over heartaches
Just like the films
If there's reason
To feel all the hard times
To lay down the hard lines
It's absolutely true
Take it for granted
You're making a mistake
Take it for what it is
But take it for God's sake

Take it from me
Lonely as can be
I'd love to
But I never dared to
If only I could make you see

Once a man stood by a wall
And watched his love across the beach
And though her loveliness could warm his heart
Her lips he could not reach

And nothing would he do
Nothing would he say
He just keeps it all inside himself
And saves it for another day
Then he heard a song
Sweetly over the wall
Singing its better to have loved and lost
Than never to have loved at all

Take it for granted
Oh don't make that mistake
Take it for what it is
But take it for God's sake mmm

Take it from me
Lonely as can be
I'd love to but I never dared to
But if only I.. I could make you see

Once a girl gazed out her window
At the moon above the sea
And as the breeze touched her face
The thought of him wouldn't let her be

Will he pass by
Or will this feeling just pass away
How am I to try and understand
What is this price I have to pay

Shall I turn my back to my pillow
Let the moon fall to the sea
And keep it all and not sleep at all
Or maybe I'll just dream
Take it for granted
You're making a mistake
Take it for what it is
But take it for God's sake oh

Take it from me
Lonely as can be
I'd love to but I never dared to
But if only I could make you see
I know so many people who think they can do it alone
They isolate their heads and stay in their safety zone
Now what can you tell them?
What can you say that won't make them defensive?

Hang on to your ego
Hang on, but I know that you're gonna lose the fight

They come on like they're peaceful, but inside they're so uptight
They trip through the day and waste all their thoughts at night
Now how can I say it?
And how can I come on when I know I'm guilty?

Hang on to your ego
Hang on, but I know that you're gonna lose the fight

Now how can I say it?
And how can I come on when I know I'm guilty?

Hang on to your ego
Hang on, but I know that you're gonna lose the fight

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I break down
Fear is sinking in
The cold comes
Racing through my skin
Searching for a way to get to you
Through the storm you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Go, giving up your home
Go, leaving all you’ve known
You are not alone

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
With arms up
Stretched into the sky
With eyes like
Echoes in the night
Hiding from the hell that you’ve been through
Silent one, you

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Go, giving up your home
Go, leaving all you’ve known
You go, giving up your home
Go, leaving all you’ve known
You are not alone

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
You go, giving up your home
Go, leaving all you’ve known

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You go, giving up your home
Go, you are not unknown
You are not alone
You are not unknown
You are not alone
When I first met you, baby
Baby, you were just sweet sixteen
When I first met you, baby
Baby, you were just sweet sixteen
You just left your home then, woman
Ah, the sweetest thing I'd ever seen

But you wouldn't do nothing, baby
You wouldn't do anything I asked to
You wouldn't do nothing for me, baby
You wouldn't do anything I asked to
You know you ran away from your home, baby
And now you wanna run away from old B. too

You know I loved you, baby
I loved you before I could call your name
You know I loved you, baby
Baby I loved you, I love you before I could call your name
Well, it seems like everything I do now baby
Everything I do is in vain
My brother's in Korea, baby
My sister's down in New Orleans
Brother's in Korea baby
My sister's down in New Orleans
You know I'm having so much trouble woman
Baby, I wonder, what in the world is gonna happen to me

You know I love you
And I'll do anything you tell me to
You know I love you
And I'll do anything you tell me to
Well, there ain't nothing in the world, woman
Babe, it ain't nothing
Nothing in the world I wouldn't do it for you

You can treat me mean, baby
But I'll keep on loving you just the same
You can treat me mean baby
But I'll keep on loving you just the same
But one of these days, baby
You're gonna give a lot of money
To hear someone call my name

Yes, sweet sixteen baby... sweet sixteen...
Yes, the sweetest thing baby
The sweetest thing I ever seen
You know I'm having so much trouble, woman
Baby I wonder
Yes I wonder
Baby I wonder
Oh, I wonder what in the world's gonna happen to me

[Verse 1]
Lesson in survival
Spinning out on turns, that gets you tough
Guru books, the Bible
Only a reminder that you're just not good enough
You need to believe in something
Once I could in our love

[Verse 2]
Black road, double yellow line
Friends and kin, campers in the kitchen, that's fine sometimes
But I know my needs, my sweet tumbleweed
I need more quiet times
By a river flowing, you and me
Deep kisses and the sun going down

[Verse 3]
Maybe it's paranoia, maybe it's sensitivity
Your friends protect you, scrutinize me, I get so damn timid
Not at all the spirit that's inside of me
Oh baby, I can't seem to make it with you socially
There's this reef around me

[Verse 4]
I'm looking way out at the ocean
Love to see that green water in motion
I'm going to get a boat
And we can row it if you ever get the notion
To be needed by me
Fresh salmon frying and the tide rolling in

[Verse 5]
I went to see a friend tonight, was very late when I walked in
My talking as it rambled revealed suspicious reasoning
The visit seemed to darken him
I came in as bright as a neon light
And I burned out right there before him

[Verse 6]
I told him these things I'm telling you now
Watched them buckle up in his brow
When you dig down deep, you lose good sleep
And it makes you heavy company
I will always love you, hands alike
Magnet and iron, the souls
She'll be comin' 'round the mountain when she comes
(Yoohoo!)
She'll be comin' 'round the mountain when she comes
(Yoohoo!)
She'll be comin' 'round the mountain
She'll be comin' 'round the mountain

She'll be comin' 'round the mountain when she comes
Don't want no tears shed for me when I'm gone
Don't want nobody to sing no melancholy song
Don't want your partin' words to become my eulogy
Just have a ragtime band to play when you say goodbye to me

Keep that whiskey flowin', boys, and raise your glasses high
I'm pleased to see you're here to say "Farewell" and not "Goodbye"
Keep that whiskey flowin', boys and raise your glasses high
And damn the man that dares to let my farewell party die

Don't want no organ music bringin' people down
Don't want no long-faced mourners always hangin' 'round
Don't want no candles, ah, but let the flowers stay
Girls can wear them in their hair when they see me on my way

Keep that whiskey flowin', boys, and raise your glasses high
I'm pleased to see you're here to say "Farewell" and not "Goodbye"
Keep that whiskey flowin', boys and raise your glasses high
And damn the man that dares to let my farewell party die

Roll the carpet back, my boys, and let the dancin' start
Sing all the good old songs and don't forget my part
Invite all the girls I've known and make sure they have fun
Hug and kiss 'em all for me like you know I would have done
Keep that whiskey flowin', boys, and raise your glasses high
I'm pleased to see you're here to say "Farewell" and not "Goodbye"
Keep that whiskey flowin', boys and raise your glasses high
And damn the man that dares to let my farewell party die

Keep that whiskey flowin', boys, and raise your glasses high
I'm pleased to see you're here to say "Farewell" and not "Goodbye"
Keep that whiskey flowin', boys and raise your glasses high
And damn the man that dares to let my farewell party die
Hello dolly, well hello dolly
It's so nice to have you back where you belong
You're looking swell, dolly, we can tell, dolly
You're still glowing, you're still crowing, you're still going strong
We feel the room swaying 'cause the band's playing
One of your old favorite songs from way back when
Take a rap, fellows, find her an empty lap, fellows
Dolly'll never go away, dolly'll never go away...
(instrumental by louie armstrong playing his saxophone)
Hello sax, this is francis, louie

It's so nice to see you back where you belong
You're back on top, louie, never stop, louie
You're still singing, you're still swinging, you're still going strong
You get the room swaying when you start in playing
One of your great songs, your songs from way back when
Blow your horn, louie, sing up a great big song, louie
Promise you won't go away, promise you won't go away
Promise you won't go away again
Louie armstrong: oh yeah!
Saw the lady face to face
Who rules the joker, commands the ace
I just rolled in from the golden state
Just a dusty spoke on the wheel of fate

What'll you raise?
What'll you raise?
What'll you raise to take my hand?

The hand I hold is the hand I play
Who'd have ever thought they would fall this way
Can't see me if you won't call
And it might be a stone buff after all

What'll you raise?
What'll you raise?
What'll you raise to take my hand?

What'll you raise?
What'll you raise?
What'll you raise to see my hand?
If there is heaven
Those are the priests
Who can deliver at all?

Is there a gaping or any safekeeping?
If not, how far can we fall?
Far can we fall?

East of the sun and the west of the moon
Darling hold on, I'll be coming soon
Maybe our love was meant to be
The only solution is to wait and see

What'll you raise?
What'll you raise?
What'll you raise to take my hand?

What'll you raise?
What'll you raise?
What'll you raise to take my hand?
Dashing through these hoes
Cadillac's and sixty 'fo's
On three wheels we go
Clocking lots of doe

Cellphone ringtone ring
My song "because I got high"
Smoking weed while I watch
The police flying by!

Oh, jinglebell, east palmdale jobe is back and not whack
Oooh found your daughter and you finally caught 'er and you mad 'cause I'm black
Ahaha I f**ked her good, just like I should, I think I blew her balloon
I didn't use a condom and now we have a problem, she havin' my baby in June (Say what?!)

I know this holiday hooker
I think her name is Jan
And if you 'ain't got no money (Hell yeah)
She's got a layaway plan

I got a blowjob from her friend
I think her name is Gwen
My dick plugged up her mouth
She couldn't get no oxygen!
Oh jinglebell, county jail, jobe's from the hood
Skinny women suck my dick real good but their butt cheeks feel like wood (Ouch!)
I be swimmin, in big fat women, when I'm in the sack (Ooh!)
Why have a skinny little bicycle bitch when I can ride a cadillac?!

I met this beautiful woman, she said she was Hawaiian
She said she didn't like black guys, however she was lyin'
She'd seen my go detonas, all my coupes and cash
She licked my hairy balls, like chocolate coconuts!

Oh, jinglebell, shotgun shell, sheriff got a gun
He pulled the trigger, shot that nigga look at that mo' fucka run!
Hit 'em in the head, kicked him in the ass, put a kneecap in his chest
Went to the court, and told the judge, "This man was resisting arrest!"
Oh yeah, I know you prolly never known, round here
It get hotter then the nevada, don't get tha wrong idea (don't get it fucked up)
It's just Caprice's, and Impala's sittin on chrome down here
Brawls and ballin, and that ain't all that's goin on round here
Young killaz totin' pistol's like they grown down here (ay ay)
Them young niggas similar to King Kong, round here
A pocket full of stones, would get you on down here
So dope boy, keep ya drops like the song round here (A town)
Hey it ain't safe for the fake to walk alone round here
Hey, the hell what we know if you ain't known round here
Say the wrong thing get cha back blown round here (what what)
'cause gangstas rep they hood by the zone round here (westside shawty)
Get a hole in ya dome, bout ya rims down here
24's make them dubs, look like 10's down here (ha ha)
I'm where it ends, and begins as far as rappers round here
'cause Money, hoes, cars, and clothes is all that matters down here (A yeah chea)

[Verse 1]
I love you girl, with all my heart and soul
I can't understand why you treat me cold
Your every wish, girl, is my command
And that's why I can't seem to understand why

[Chorus]
Girl, girl, girl why you wanna make me blue?
I'm askin' you girl, girl, girl why you wanna make me blue?

[Verse 2]
One day you say you love me too
The next day you tell me that we are through
My love for you is just a game
But each time we play, girl, my heart feels the pain

[Chorus]
Girl, girl, girl why you wanna make me blue? Oh
Girl, girl, girl why you wanna make me blue? So blue

[Bridge]
Woo girl, girl, girl why you wanna make me blue? (Make me blue)
Oh girl, oh girl, oh girl tell me why can't you be true? (Can't be true)

[Verse 3]
The way you treat me is just unfair
You make it so plain you just don't care
You have a ball around tha' town
Sleepless nights are getting me down

[Chorus]
Girl, girl, girl why you wanna make me blue?
I'm askin' you girl, girl, girl why you wanna make me blue? Baby
Girl, girl, girl why you wanna make me blue?

[Verse 1]
You take from me
So why you holding back? Boy, why you holding back?
So vacantly
But you won't get away with that, no, you won't get away with that

[Pre-Chorus]
They don't see what you do to me
From the outside
This can't be what it used to be
From the outside

[Chorus]
I'm telling you right now, I'm telling you right now
No, I won't play this game with you
I'm taking it back now, I'm turning it right round
My love won't be the same for you no more
My love won't be the same for you no more
No, I won't play this game

[Verse 2]
Don't wait for me
When you know you did me wrong, I've been holding on too long
Eventually
I’ll make the call

[Pre-Chorus]
They don't see what you do to me
From the outside
This can't be what it used to be
From the outside

[Chorus]
I'm telling you right now, I'm telling you right now
No, I won't play this game with you
I'm taking it back now, I'm turning it right round
My love won't be the same for you no more
My love won't be the same for you no more
No, I won't play this game

[Bridge]
No, never gonna give you the time
No, never gonna give you the time
No, never gonna give you the time
No, never gonna give you the time
No, never gonna give you the time
No, never gonna give you the time
No, never gonna give you the time
No, never gonna give you the time

[Chorus]
I'm telling you right now, I'm telling you right now
No, I won't play this game with you
I'm taking it back now, I'm turning it right round
My love won't be the same for you no more
My love won't be the same for you no more
No, I won't play this game
If I only had a match, then my cares I'd soon forget
All I need would be a match if I had a cigarette
If I had a cigarette, I could watch the smoke rings curl
But I'd really be all set, if I only had a girl
If I had someone like you, to hurry to each night
In a cozy bungalow, we'd know such sweet delight
We could raise a family, and a little garden patch
And to think this all could be, if I only had a match

If I had someone like you, to hurry to each night
In a cozy bungalow, we'd know such sweet delight
We could raise a family, and a little garden patch
And to think this all could be, if I only had a match
I've got my questionaire
Aand they need me in the war
I've got my questionaire
Aand they need me in the war
Yes, if i have to commit murder
Won't have to (???)

I want the thirty two-twenty
Made on a forty-five frame
I want the thirty two-twenty
Made on a forty-five frame
And a red, white and blue fag
Wear it in my right hand

Yeah, you can tell my baby
Tell her to please wait for me
Yeah, you can tell my baby
Tell her to please wait for me
Well i meet her one mornin'
Down by that old red sea

[Intro]

So tell me who's your man, we will have a talk with him (I like)
Yeah, 'cause it's sold out like that—R. (What up, dawg?)
Bring the verse back
Now the time has come for you and I to knock it
So bring it on, and I'll do you all night long (I like, do it, baby, uh)
Give me your number and I'll call you yesterday
To let you hear what I have to say (Come on)

[Chorus]
I, I, I, I like the crotch on you
I want the crotch on you
I need the crotch on you
So tell me what you're gonna do
I, I like the crotch on you
I want the crotch on you
I need the crotch on you
So tell me what you're gonna do

[Verse 2]
I like the bunnies with the shorts on, with the booties left all in 'em
So bend over, baby, and let me freak your denim
You got the kind of booty I would love to
Freaky-deaky-deaky-deaky-deaky-deaky-deaky
No, but not without the jim-hat strappin'
Ho, because I got the 12 Play happening
The honey-lover man's got something for ya
So baby, let me squeeze ya, I gotta get to know ya
Uh, I like the crotch on you and that's that
Now let the damn verse circle back

[Verse 3]
(I, I, I, I like) What's going on inside my pants, I can't explain (I)
So bring your body over here, baby, and let the freak daddy drive ya crazy (I like)
I've got what you want so, baby, come and get it (I)
Come on, babe, I like you, yeah (I, I, I, I like)

[Verse 4]
C'mon baby, let me see you swing it, swing it
I like the way you come up, baby, when you wiggle it
Jiggle it, mmmm tasty
And once you see the D's, oh, you're gonna want to freak me, freak me
Only if you're old enough, baby
18 and over or 16 and under
Oh, but how I wonder, I wonder
I wonder, damn (I, I like)

[Chorus]
Give me the chance to show you what I have in store for you
Baby, I like, I, I, I, I like the crotch on you
I want the crotch on you
I need the crotch on you
So tell me what you're gonna do
I, I like the crotch on you
I want the crotch on you
I need the crotch on you
Now let me break it down for you (I, I, I, I like)

[Bridge]
Once you see the bozack, you're gonna freak
Once you see the bozack, you're gonna freak
Once you see the bozack, you're gonna freak
Once you see the bozack, you're gonna freak
Once you see the bozack, you're gonna freak
Once you see the bozack, you're gonna freak
Once you see the bozack, you're gonna freak
Da, da, da, da, da, da, that's that

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Hey, this is going out to all the ladies, you know what I'm saying
Because I had a little experience before I got my album out
Didn't nobody wanna give me no play, right?
Although, I did have a few girls in my clique that was down with me
(Tell us about it, man) But uh, this goes out to all the ladies who didn't wanna give me no play but now they sweatin' me, you know what I'm saying (Talk about it, brother)
But it's cool, I'm with that. But I just want to get somethin' off my chest with this second album, a'ight (Talk about it)
So I'ma break it down, explain it to ya like this:
Back in the days I used to say
'Can I get with you today?'
And you told me 'No Rob, no way, no how, not today'
I used to say 'Do you mind if we spend a little time?'
And you told me 'No Rob (No, Robert), no way, no how, not today'
I used to walk up to the girls, I said, 'Can I rock your world?'
And they told me 'No Rob (No, Robert), no way, no how, not today'
And I used to say, 'Can I knock your boots today?'
And you told me 'No Rob, no way, no how, not today'
But now that I'm all that, you see they used to call me wack
But now they say 'Yes Rob, come on, right now, you go, boy'
You see they used to call me stank
But now I'm walking to the bank, and now they tell me
'Yes Rob, come on, right now, you go, boy'
I asked them time and time again
But now they see me driving in my Benz
And now they say 'Yes Rob, come on, right now, you go, boy'
Know what I'm sayin'? You a fool, nigga
Ay, so anyway, put your money up there, and we can shoot some ball right on 18th Street, straight up
Where do you go when it starts to rain?
Where will you sleep when the night time comes?
What do you do when your heart's in pain?
Where will you run when the right time comes?

These are the things that I want to know
Where will you hide when the lights are low?
Where do you go when it starts to rain?
Where will you sleep when the night time comes?
Crazy to remember that frozen winter
Snow-bound by a lovely face
The quiet grace soothed me
The dark wine, the warm gaze
An otherworldly spell conspired to amaze
But like those winter days it wasn't made to last forever
And Sunny gone that way

Wiled to remember Stockholm December
A drunken choir
The ancient fire cooled me
Suddenly the spark flew off into the dark and left me there
As if she never knew me

A dark smile on a grey page
Like some faded photograph that someone tossed away
Someone tossed away
The silence still amazes me and Sunny gone that way

You ignored my letters, ignored my calls
Till there was nobody left for you to ignore at all
The only thing there was you and your prayers
And your silence says it all
The choir sang, guitars played
Fallen angels all across our universe that way
Like the Milky Way, its beauty still amazes me
And Sunny gone that way
Need someone's hand to lead me through the night
I need someone's arms to hold and squeeze me tight
Now, when the night begins, whoa, I'm at an end
Because I need your love so bad
I need some lips to feel next to mine
Need someone to stand up - to stand up and tell me when I'm lyin'
And when the lights are low - and it's time to go
That's when I need your love so bad
So why don't you give it up, baby and bring it home to me
Or write it on a piece of paper, woman - so it can be read to me
Tell me that you love me - and stop drivin' me mad
Whoa, because I - I need your love so bad
Need a soft voice - just to talk to me at night
Don't want you to worry, baby
I know we can make everything alright
Listen to my plea, baby, come on bring it to me
'Cause I need - your love so bad
Baby, I need, I need - woman, I need your love so bad

[Verse 1: David Ruffin]
One day, you will begin to realize
By the look that's in my eyes

[Chorus: David Ruffin + (The Temptations)]
How much I love you (Love you)
And if you leave you'll lose a precious love
(You'll lose a precious love)

[Verse 2: David Ruffin]
Somehow, these arms of mine can't let you go
The touch of my hand, baby, should let you know

[Chorus: David Ruffin + (The Temptations)]
How much I love you (Love you)
And if you leave me, you'll lose a precious love
(You'll lose a precious love)
Mmm, yes you will

[Bridge: The Temptations + Melvin Franklin]
We go together like hand and glove
Don't destroy our precious love

[Verse 3: David Ruffin]
Somehow, these arms of mine can't let you go
The touch of my hand should let you know
How much I love you (Love you)
And if you leave you'll lose a precious love
(You'll lose a precious love)

[Outro: David Ruffin, Eddie Kendricks, (The Temptations)]
Mmm, you're gonna lose
You're gonna lose a precious love
(You'll lose a precious love)
The touch of my hand should let you know
(You'll lose a precious love)
You'll lose a precious love
I've loved you so
I feel like I want to love you
In a different way
Oh, baby, baby...

Imagine if you will...experiment (science!)
Experiment, experiment

Baby, we're all alone
Nobody around to know
Think of all the things that we can do
Or maybe we could try on something new
'cause girl, we don't need permission
To try out a new position
Just to plant the seed
Of ecstacy
Is all we need
And we can both be free

To do the things we've never done before
Baby, close your eyes and let's explore
Baby, let's experiment...(experiment)
We don't have to do the same old thing
Open up your mind and we can twang
Baby, let's experiment...
Come on, come on, come on
Don't be afraid, baby
Girl, you won't be misled
What don't you see you can, could
'cause girl it's like duh
You can take it to the head, baby
My eyes have seen the glory of your precious love
Have you ever wondered how it'd feel

To do the things we've never done before
Baby, close your eyes and let's explore
Baby, let's experiment...(experiment)
We don't have to do the same old thing
Girl, to tell the truth, it's quite mundane
Baby, let's experiment...
Then you will see just what I mean!

Hold me close, girl, 'cause I've been waiting too long
Me, myself, I like it better with the lights on
Let's get blazed through a drink or two
To get you in the mood
I think it's cool, yeah
You know exactly what I need, babe
Sugar, didn't think you'd do this
Girl it's so good
I wish that you would
Experiment with me, baby
Experiment with my love
Come on, come on, baby
Oh, baby, won't you please experiment with me tonight
Experiment with my love tonight
In this farewell, there's no blood, there's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret from the truth of a thousand lies

So let mercy come, and wash away what I've done
I'll face myself, to cross out what I've become
Erase myself, and let go of what I've done

Put to rest what you thought of me
While I clean this slate with the hands of uncertainty

So let mercy come, and wash away what I've done
I'll face myself, to cross out what I've become
Erase myself, and let go of what I've done

For what I've done, I'll start again, and whatever pain may come
Today, this ends, and forgiving what I've done
I'll face myself, to cross out what I've become
Erase myself, and let go of what I've done
(Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
What I've done
(Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
Forgiving what I've done
(Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na)
I asked my love to take a walk
Take a walk, just a little ways
And as we walked and we would talk
How it would be our weddingday

And only say that you'll be mine
In no others arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
On the banks of the Ohio

I asked her if she'd marry me
And my wife forever be
She only turned her head away
And had no other words to say

And only say that you'll be mine
In no others arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
On the banks of the Ohio

I plunged a knife into her breast
And told her she was going to rest
She cried "Oh Willy, don't murder me
I'm not prepared for eternity."
I took her by her golden curls
And drug her down to the river-side
An there I threw her into drown
And I watched her as she floated down

And only say that you'll be mine
In no others arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio

And going home between twelve and one
I cried "Oh Lord, what have I've done?"
I've killed the only girl I love
Because she would not marry me

And only say that you'll be mine
In no others arms entwined
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio
If your heart's in doubt, my love
Worried about my love
Then all your fear
Is only foolish fancy, dear
If I didn't care more than words can say
If I didn't care would I feel this way?
If this isn't love

Then maybe I'm wrong
But why do I lie awake all night
And dream all day long?
If I didn't care would it be the same?
Would every prayer begin and end with just your name?
And would I be sure that this is love beyond compare?
Would all this be true
If I didn't care for you?

[Verse 1]
Ooh, I got a body full of liquor
With a cocaine kicker
And I'm feeling like I'm thirty feet tall
So lay it down, lay it down
You got your legs up in the sky
With the devil in your eyes
Let me hear you say you want it all
Say it now, say it now

[Pre-Chorus]
Look what you're doing
Kook what you've done
But in this jungle you can't run
Cause what I got for you, I promise it's a killa
You'll be banging on my chest, bang bang, gorilla

[Chorus]
Ooh, yeah
You and me, baby, making love like gorillas
Ooh, yeah
You and me, baby, making love like gorillas

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I got a fistful of your hair
But you don't look like you're scared
You're just smiling, tell me "Daddy, it's yours"
Cause you know how I like it you's a dirty little lover
If the neighbors call the cops
Call the sheriff, call the SWAT, we don't stop
We keep rocking while they knocking on our door
And you're screaming, "Give it to me baby
Give it to me, motherfucker!"

[Pre-Chorus]
Look what you're doing
Look what you've done
But in this jungle you can't run
Cause what I got for you, I promise it's a killa
You'll be banging on my chest, bang bang, gorilla

[Chorus]
Ooh, yeah
You and me, baby, making love like gorillas
Ooh, yeah
You and me, baby, making love like gorillas

[Bridge]
I bet you never ever felt so good, so good
I got your body trembling like it should, it should
You'll never be the same, baby, once I'm done with
Yoo-oo-oo-oo-oou, yeah

[Breakdown]
You, you, you...

[Chorus]
Oho, you with me, baby, making love like gorillas
Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah
Yeah, you and me ,baby, we'll be fucking like gorillas
(Oh...)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, baby baby, aw, yeah
You and me baby, making love like gorillas
It seems to me I've heard that song before
It's from an old familiar score
I know it well, that melody

It's funny how a theme
Recalls a favorite dream
A dream that brought you so close to me

I know each word, because I've heard that song before
For evermore's a memory

Please have them play it again
And (Then) I'll remember just when
I heard that lovely song before

It's funny how a theme
Recalls a favorite dream
A dream that brought you so close to me

Please have them play it again
And I'll remember just when I heard that lovely song before
I've got too much on my plate
Don't have no time to be a decent lover
I hope it isn't too late
Searching for the time that has gone so fast
The time that I thought would last
My ever present past

I've got too much on my mind
I think of everything to be discovered
I hope there's something to find
Searching for the time that has gone so fast
The time that I thought would last
My ever present past

The things I think I did
I d.i. d.i. did
The things I think I did
When I was a kid

I couldn't understand a word that they were saying
But still I hung around and took it all in
I wouldn't join in with the games that they were playing
It went by, it went by in a flash
It flew by, it flew by
In a flash
There's far too much on my plate
Don't have no time to be a decent lover
I hope it's never too late
Searching for the time that has gone so fast
The time that I thought would last
My ever present past

The things I think I did
I d.i. d.i. did
The things I think I did
When I was a kid

The things I think I did
I d.i. d.i. did
The things I think I did
When I was a kid
When I was a kid

[Intro]
Never let, never, never let her go
Never let, never, never let her go
Never let, never, never let her go
Never let, never, never let her go

[Verse 1 - Ali-Ollie Woodson]
Some enchanted evening you may see a stranger
You may see a stranger across a crowded room
And somehow you know, you know even then
That somewhere you'll see her again and again

Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing
You may hear her laughing across a crowded room
And night after night, as strange as it seems
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams

[Bridge]
Who can explain it, who can tell you why
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try

[Chorus]
Never let, never, never let her go
Never let, never, never let her go
Never let, never, never let her go
Never let, never, never let her go

[Verse 2 - Theo Peoples]
Some enchanted evening, when you find your true love
When you feel her call you across a crowded room
Then fly to her side and make her your own
Or all through your life you may dream all alone

[Bridge]
Once you have found her, never let her go
Once you have found her, never let her go
Never let her go

[Chorus - Ali/Theo]
Never let, never, never let her go
Never let, never, never let her go
Never let, never, never let her go (Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger)
Never let, never, never let her go (You can hear her laughing, calling from across the room)
Never let, never, never let her go (Who could explain it? Who can tell you why?)
Never let, never, never let her go (Fools give you reasons, wise men never try)
Never let, never, never let her go (I never know)
Never let, never, never let her go
Never let, never, never let her go (You better run to her side, let her know that you're alive)
Never let, never, never let her go
Never let, never, never let her go
Never let, never, never let her go
Goodnight Louise
It's lights out for me
It was hot for a minute
We were right down there in it
But hey Lou c'est la vie

Sweet romance
One last dance
I should be moving on
But they're playing our song
I might Louise I just might

What's in a moon one lonely night
What's in a heart that is true
Some would say that means everything
Don't mean a thing without you

So flies love
And stars up above
You were first but not the last
You're the queen of my past
Goodnight Louise.. goodnight
You were first
But not the last
You're the queen of my past
Goodnight.. Louise.. Goodnight
Goodnight
You're only acting like
You are somebody
But I don't love to say
You're not nobody

Don't exhaust our painted face, girl
'Cause underneath that face
You're just have disgrace

And you're just a brand new second hand
You'll make no one fool
You're just a brand new second hand
I only confess you

You're brand new second had
Dirty golden rule
You're just a brand new second hand

What you've got, girl
That I don't know
Why you really really got to
Exalt yourself so
Mama used to tell me
A long time ago, girl
It's not everything you own
That glitters is gold

So you're just a brand new second hand
No man no want no
Brand new second hand
You better go back round so girl

Brand new second hand
Don't you show us
Brand new second hand

If you think it's the dress you wear
That makes you a lady
Get that out of your mind
You must be crazy

You're just a brand new second hand, yes girl
No man no want
Brand new second hand, yes girl
No bother come show off so
You're just a brand new second hand

[Verse 1]
I tried a mailtrain, mama, can't buy a thrill
I've been up all night, mama, leanin' on the window sill
If I die on top of the hill
If I don't make it, know my baby will

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Don't the moon look good, mama, shinin' through the trees?
Don't the brakeman look good, mama, flagging down the "Double E"?
Don't the sun look good fine setting down over the sea?
Don't my gal look fine when she's running after me?

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Wintertime is coming, the windows are filled with frost
I tried to tell everybody, but I could not get across
I wanna be your lover, baby, I don't wanna be your boss
Don't say I never warned you when your train gets lost
Don't say I never warned you when your train gets lost
Verse 1:
I think I messed up this time
I let you go and I can't get no sleep
The thoughts going through my head
What I should have done instead
I'm trying to be free
I thought I'd get over you
I'm finding its hard to do
And I'm so confused
I don't know

Chorus:
Why does it hurt so bad
How come I just can't let you go
(I wanna know yea)
Cause I shouldn't feel this sad
But I can't help it, I miss you so

Verse 2:
But I had to run around
I couldn't settle down
I was chasing my dreams
And I sit here by myself
And now you're with someone else
When It should be me
I thought it get easier
I said I didn't need you
And I can't believe I was wrong

[Chorus 2x's]
Vamp:
Said it hurts so bad (hurts so bad)
Said it hurts me so bad (hurts so bad)

[Repeat 3x's]

Hook:
I wish you would come around
I wish we could work it out
I wish you were here
But you're gone

[Chorus]

[Vamp til fade out]
Come round you old time cowboys, and listen to my song
Please do not grow weary, I will not detain you long
Concerning some young cowboy, who did agree to go
Spend the summer pleasantly on the trail of the buffalo
Well I found myself in Griffin, in the year of '83
When a world-famous drover come a-walkin' up to me
Sayin', "How d'ya do young cowboy. how'd you like to go
Spend the summer pleasantly on the trail of the buffalo?"
Well me being out of work right then, at this drover I did say
"This a-goin' out on the buffalo range depends upon your pay
But if you pay good wages, transportation to and fro'
Think I might go with you on the hunt of the buffalo."
"yes I will pay good wages and transportation too
If you'll agree to work for me until the season's through
But if you do get homesick and try to run away
You'll starve to death on the prairie and also lose your pay."
Well with all this flatterin' talkin', he signed up quite a train
Some ten to twelve in number, some able-bodied men
Our trip it was a pleasant one as we hit the westward road
Until we hit old Boggy Creek in old New Mexico
Well there our pleasures ended and our troubles they begun
A lightin' storm did hit us, made the cattle run
I got all full of stickers from the cactus that did grow
Outlaws watchin' to pick us off from the hills of the buffalo
Well our workin' season ended, but the drover would not pay
He said, "You went and drunk too much, you're all in debt to me."
But the cowboys never did hear of such a thing as a bankrupt law
So we left tht drover's bones to bleach on the hills of the buffalo

[Chorus]
Something 'bout the way that you workin' me
Teasin' me, pleasing me, easily, boy, I'm addicted to you
I'm addicted to you
Gotta have ya for all the things that you do
It something 'bout this feeling, it's crazy
Amazing that stays with me all night and day
Makes my temperature rise
Boy, your love has got me so hypnotized

[Verse 1]
I'm feeling something that I can't understand
It's like I'm captured by the touch of your hand
It's so vibe, it's your style, it's the way hat you smile
Get a little rush when I hear your name
It's all magnetic with your hand next to me
Holdin' me close happens so naturally
We connect, this electrical feeling inside
Didn't know that even if I tried

[Chorus]
Something 'bout the way that you workin' me
Teasin' me, pleasing me, easily, boy, I'm addicted to you
I'm addicted to you
Gotta have ya for all the things that you do
It something 'bout this feeling, it's crazy
Amazing that stays with me all night and day
Makes my temperature rise
Boy, your love has got me so hypnotized

[Verse 2]
You got me spinning like a merry go round
Feels like I'm flyin', but I ain't off the ground
Fallin' fast, I'm afraid, can't escape, there's no way
Never had a feeling like this before

[Chorus]
Something 'bout the way that you workin' me
Teasin' me, pleasing me, easily, boy, I'm addicted to you
I'm addicted to you
Gotta have ya for all the things that you do
It something 'bout this feeling, it's crazy
Amazing that stays with me all night and day
Makes my temperature rise
Boy, your love has got me so hypnotized

[Bridge]
It's amazing how you drive me crazy
Boy keep doin' what you're doin'
Cause you're really gettin through to me
Day and night babe, you know I can't fight it
Just one look into my eyes and you know you got me hypnotized

[Chorus]
Something 'bout the way that you workin' me
Teasin' me, pleasing me, easily, boy, I'm addicted to you
I'm addicted to you
Gotta have ya for all the things that you do
It something 'bout this feeling, it's crazy
Amazing that stays with me all night and day
Makes my temperature rise
Boy, your love has got me so hypnotized
There is one kind favor I ask of you
One kind favor I ask of you
One kind favor I ask of you
See that my grave is kept clean
Have you ever heard a church bell tone?
You ever hear a church bell tone?
You ever hear a curchh bell tone?
You know by then I'm dead and gone
Dig my grave with a silver spade
Dig my grave with a silver spade
Dig my grave with a silver spade
Mark the place where I will lay
There is one kind favor I ask of you
One kind favor I ask of you
One kind favor I ask of you
See that my grave is kept clean

[Intro]
I was trotting along...
The desert was hot...
And I sang this song

[Verse 1]
Yo, I'm rugged
My camel's got the three-wheeled motion
Every word I say you want to put into your quotient
Zanzabar, raised by the wolves
Oxford education as phrased by the wolves
My khaki shirt's tucked into my tight khaki pants
I drink too much and do my white, whacky dance
To hell with that, I'm a man without shame
Listen to the howls on the wind there's my name
(Zanzabar) Hell yes bitch, say it loud
I see the shape of a vagina in every passing cloud
And in my weary state, I thirst for bread
Could settle for my sketches of vagina clouds instead
I hunger for water, ache for my wolf friends
I have jerked off to vagina clouds at least 73 times now
Vagina clouds...
Vagina... they look so pretty
I wonder if people suspect that I'm a wolf
As opposed to a manly adventurer?
Man it's hot, sun all around me
I'd better focus on a vagina cloud to ground me
Ah, that's better, woops, there's the wolf pack
I think that I'll rape my sidekick with my name, Zanzabar

[Verse 2]
God damn is it hot, what's the deal?
It seems we haven't been talking for hours
The sun is so hot I've been eating sand mixed with flour
Zanzabar, he calls them sand pops
I call them disgusting. He likes them a lot
He says, "They're tastier hot, better strike that match up."
I say, "Maybe you're right. Could you pass the ketchup?"
That's about it on the conversation front
What could he be thinking as he sits on his hump?
I bet he just hates the rice meatloaf I made
And seems less than impressed with the souflees I souflee
In fact he's never impressed with anything that I cook
He just points to the sky, turns to me and says "Look!
That vagina cloud there, I think it winked at me!"
I say, "That's great double-z, I only saw a bunny
And that one there, sort of looks like a gun."
"A vagina gun?"
"No, a regular one. Like this one here that I'm pointing at you
Filled with poisonous darts that stick to you like glue
See I'm sick of your crap, and your vagina rap
So I leave you to die as your spinal gets tapped
Slowly losing your mind and start hallucinating
So you can watch your clouds and keep masturbating."

[Verse 3]
"Wooh, Zanzabar feels funny
I'm floating up to the clouds and everything looks runny."
"Z, come back! I feel terrible, but the heat and the verbal
Abuse was unbearable!"
"Worry not tiny sidekick, I don't hate ya
Though I wish I had time to come down there and rape ya."
"You don't mean that, I'm sure, it's the poison that's talking."
"With my new wings I prefer flying to walking."
"You're just flapping your arms in the sand."
"Your delusions of grandeur are certainly grand
Now if you don't mind I'll be flying to China
Oh look! There's a cactus that's shaped like a vagina!"
"Wait you fool! Aw I stepped in some shit."
"Observe as I tickle the cactus's clit!"
"I just bought these shoes, holy crap, I am mad
Now I'll have to return them, and I lost the receipt
Aw, it must be here somewhere... in the trash...
Aw! Who took out the trash?
Mom! I told you not to come in here, this is my room!
It's my room, my space!"
"Hey I pay the bills!"
"Read the sign on the door! Aw geez..."
"Where's your friend Zanzabar?"
"Gone, what do you care?"
"Well he was such a sweet boy!"
"Always marching in here, trying to tell me what to do!
I'm sick of this, so freaking sick of this!"
There's lonely hearts in Arkansas
There's truckers in Des Moines
All there to keep me company in the early morn
A world unknown to daytime
Is forever going on
The airways of the nation
Between midnight and the dawn

Late nite radio
Take it everywhere I go
Best friend when I'm lonely
Is my late nite radio

Well I turn the dial
A little bit past one-o-one point two
In time to catch the news
And see who's shooting who
Then I hunt around for old songs
They're so good to hear again
To think of how it was
Imagine how it might have been
Late nite radio
Take it everywhere I go
Best friend when I'm lonely
Is my late nite radio

La La La I sing along
'Cause I never know the words
La La La La La La La La La
I'd love to call a talk show
But I haven't got the nerve
La La La Oh Oh Oh radio

The Lord is still my shepherd
But these preachers got to go
This time of night my interest
Lies in U.F.O.'s
So I turn the dial a little
Past fifty-six point three
To find myself a lullaby
To rock me off to sleep

Late nite radio
Take it everywhere I go
Best friend when I'm lonely
Is my late nite radio
Late nite radio
Take it everywhere I go
Best friend when I'm lonely
Is my late nite radio
Hey oh, I saw you walkin' by my way so
I thought I would come over and say hello
To you right now
But when I tried to speak the words won't come out
It's you girl, it's definetly something you do girl
That's got my heart beating over time
When you're around
It's like you lift me up and I can come back down
I used to keep my feelings all to me
But now my heart's right on my sleeve for all to see
Because I, I want to be
Every little thing that you want
That you need, that you breathe
And I know it might sound crazy
I think that it's amazing what you do to me
Oh maybe this could truly be
That I'm in love, in love, in love
Oh I'm in love, in love, in love
Oh you're my sunlight
You're my everything's going to be alright
The only thing I need is my life
From day to night my troubles disappear when you hold me tight
And I know I'll never find another like you
So I promise that I'll never let you go
You're all I need, 'cause baby without you I'm just not me
If this is somehow just all a dream
Then please just let me stay
Oh I just want to stay asleep
Because I, I want to be
Every little thing that you want
That you need, that you breathe
And I know it might sound crazy
I think that it's amazing what you do to me
Oh maybe this could truly be
That I'm in love, in love, in love
Oh I'm in love, in love, in love
And if the stars fall from the sky
I'll pick them up for you, baby
'Cause you're the only reason why I wake up in the morning, baby
And I might sound a little too far for me to say, but I'ma do it anyway
'Cause I think that this could mean, girl
That I, I want to be every little thing that you want
That you need, that you breathe
And I know it might sound crazy
I think that it's amazing what you do to me
Oh maybe this could truly be
That I'm in love, in love, in love
Oh I'm in love, in love, in love
(x 18)

[Verse 1]
He is a hustler, he's no good at all
He is a loser, he's a bum, bum, bum, bum
He lies, he bluffs, he's unreliable
He is a sucker with a gun, gun, gun, gun
I know you told me I should stay away
I know you said he's just a dog astray
He's a bad boy with a tainted heart
And even I know this ain't smart

[Chorus]
But mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy

[Verse 2]
He is a villain by the devil's law
He is a killer just for fun, fun, fun, fun
The man's a snitch and unpredictable
He's got no conscience, he got none, none, none, none
Oh, I know, should've let go, but no
'Cause he's a bad boy with a tainted heart
And even I know this ain't smart

[Chorus]
But mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy

[Bridge]
And he's got my name
Tattooed on his arm, his lucky charm
So I guess it's okay, he's with me
And I hear people talk (People talk)
Try to make remarks, keep us apart
But I don't even hear, I don't care

[Chorus]
'Cause mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy

[Outro]
(Oh I know-oh) Mama I'm in love with a criminal
(Should've let go) And this type of love isn't rational
(But no) It's physical
(Oh I know-oh) Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
(Should've let go) All reason aside
(But no) I just can't deny, love the guy
I know perfectly well
I'm not where I should be
I've been very aware
You've been patient with me

Every time we break up
You bring back your love to me
And after all I've done to you
How can it be

You still believe in me

I try hard to be more
What you want me to be
But I can't help how I act
When you're not here with me

I try hard to be strong
But sometimes I fail myself
And after all I've promised you
So faithfully
You still believe in me

I wanna cry...

[Verse 1]
Though the idea of compassion
Is said to be
The union of Christ
And his bride, the Christian
It's all very puzzling

[Chorus]
Sex and the church
Sex and the church
Sex and the church
And the church
And the church

[Verse 2]
All the great mystic religions
Put strong emphasis, on
Redeaming spiritual qualities
Of sex
Of sex

[Verse 3]
Chrstianity
Has been pretty modern
About sex
Of sex, of sex, of sex, of sex

[Chorus]
Sex and the church
Sex and the church
Sex and the church
Sex, sex

[Verse 4]
I think there is a union
Between the flesh and the spirit
It's sex and the church
Sex and the church

All religions' mother

[Verse 5]
Give me you're freedom of spirit
And the joys of the flesh
Of sex, sex
Sex and the church

[Verse 6]
Give me you're freedom of spirit
And the joys of the flesh
Of sex, sex
Sex and the church

[Chorus]
Sex and the church
Sex and the church
Sex and the church
And the church
And the church

Sex sex
Sex and the church
Sex and the church
Sex and the church
Sex sex

Sex and the church
Sex and the church
Sex and the church
And the church
And the church

Sex sex
Sex and the church
Sex and the church
Sex and the church
Sex sex
Sex
Sex and the church
Sex and the church
Sex and the church
Sex sex

(Oh, my baby)
Putting down, baby
(Putting down now)
I just came back from
(I don't know)
Mexicali
(I been down there)
I just came back in town
(They don't know)
Looking for my Sally
(I don't know my baby)
Have you seen her?
(Running free, yeah)
Have you seen her
(Oooh hoo)
Talkin' about my baby
(Goin' down)
Talkin' about my baby

[Verse 1]
I just came in
I just came in baby
I just came in
I just came in
Spreading magic honey
All in my bed
She got chains, attached to my head
Talkin' about
Talkin' about
Talkin' about my baby
I don't know her

[Verse 2]
They don't know, what I know
They don't know, like I know
All the time been hangin' around
All the time I hang around
She didn't know
Ahh she didn't care
She didn't know
She didn't care
And she go walkin' down the street singin'
Everybody da
Da da dada da doo doo
Etc. (scat singing)

[Outro]
They don't know
Nobody knows
They don't know
Just don't know
Da da da

[Scat Singing]

[Verse 1]
LA is the place, sets my mind ablaze
For me it's a race through a cotton-picking maze
For you it's a chase, but I lose you in the haze
I like spend my days while you're catchin' rain in your cage
Go out!

[Verse 2]
The town makes me jump, it's got a bunch of bad chicks
Well sure, it's got some chumps, but I still get my kicks
My body loves to scrump when I lick the ripe pick
Alike dump on a thumb
Pop hump, hump, hump, pop out

[Verse 3]
The action never stops, I'm as wild as can be
Because I'm shooting for the top, and my best friend is Flea
Oom Chucka Willy knew the balls could pop
But he never met the Tree so he never bebopped, hop out

[Verse 4]
Antoine the Swan, from the pretty fish pond
Was a bad motherfucker, you could tell by his clothes
He wore a cold paisley jacket and a hella fine ass
In between his legs was a sweet young lass
Threw a hundred women up against the wall
And he swore to the devil that he'd fuck 'em all
By the time he got to ninety-nine he had to stop
'Cause his penis and his ball were about to pop

[Bridge]
Last night and the night before
I heard a fop outside, then I came indoors!
Freak out!

[Verse 5]
Now that I told you a little something about the Flea
A little something about the Tree
A little something about me
I can't leave you hangin' about my man Oom Chucka Willie
From the coconut grove, was a mean mother fucker
Slim get down, rock your guitar!

[Outro]
We're all a bunch of brothers living in a cool way
Along with six million others in this place called LA
Step out!

[Verse 1]
Winds may blow over the icy sea
I'll take with me the warmth of thee
A taste of honey (Just a little bit, just a taste)
Much sweeter than wine
(Don't you know honey's so much sweeter)

[Verse 2]
I'll leave behind my heart to wear
And may it e'er remind you of
A taste of honey
A taste much sweeter than wine
(A little bit sweeter, and you show it)
(You got me goin' and you know it)

[Bridge]
I will return
I'll return
I'll come back for the honey and you

(Sweeter, sweeter, so much sweeter)

[Verse 3]
He ne'er came back to his love so fair
And so she died dreaming of his kiss
His kiss of honey
A taste more bitter than wine
(Sweeter, sweeter, so much sweeter)
(He never came back again for her)

[Bridge]
I will return
I will return
I'll come back for the honey and you

[Outro]
A taste of honey
A taste of honey
(I've got to have)
A taste of honey
(Just a little taste of honey)
A taste of honey

[R. Kelly - talking (continues behind Chorus)]
Roll, cheah, cheah
Roll, cheah, cheah
Roll, cheah, cheah

[Chorus]
You can catch me in the club with a gangsta girl
When I ride, I'm gonna ride with a gangsta girl
When I smoke, I'm gonna smoke with a gangsta girl
When I freak, I'm gonna freak me a gangsta

[Verse 1 - R. Kelly]
I'm lookin' for them gangsta girls, not them fake ass Wanksta girls
Just them ghetto fabulous girls, gotta keep 'em in my world
Mama makin gangsta moves, rollin with this gangsta dudes
Sittin' on, spinnin' 24's, openin' up Bentley doors
Drunk at the party, hands up in the air but still she sexy when she shake her body
That type of chick that says hey girl, let's go to the after party
After that we go to my room for the after, after party
Y'all know what happens next, Hypnotiq and a rated X, got her singin' the greatest sex
Now on dubs, rollin' up, into the club, raisin' 'em up
Now we in the back, blazin' 'em up, dice in hand, shakin 'em up

And if you in the club with hands up, you can gangsta girl

[Baby - talking behind Chorus]
Oh yeah

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Baby]
Ok, mami your so gangsta cause she fuck with nothin' but gangsta (gangsta)

And she fuck with nothin' but gangstas that is 'ol 'ol G 'ol G, 24's on that brand new G
At a gangsta party, she'll be drinkin' Bacardi, and she pops her body, don't you hurt nobody
Got my killers in here, they'll squirt somebody, but that Benz so fast, it'll jerk your body
And we smokin' that Cali dro, totin' that Calico
Bird man and Kelly mami, let your body roll
No one will never know, what happen behind the door
I like it fast or slow, a freaky chick fo sho
Street life is all I know, hustlin' and stackin' dough
I feel to keep it gangsta, until my cats get closed

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Mannie Fresh]
Once upon a time in this place called hood
Where the gangsta girls shake it and they all smell good
Lived this legendary pimp (pimp) by the name of Fresh
Fix hair, fix nails, fix toes, fix breast
But one chick super sick, make every nigga grab his stick
Heart pound up and down, when she goin' round and round
Do the Snake, stop and shake, bottom like an earthquake
I can't wait to meet her uh, undress her, fuck her up
Now we leavin' from the club, and she let me cop a rub
Can't believe she choose me
Feelin On Her Booty
I'm about to cut like knives, strokin' mami with some ice
Takin' me to paradise, I nut once, she nut twice
Sex in cities, rubbin' titties, that's how I get it
One more 'gain, with her friend, playa that's how I hit it
Now we grippin', grabbin', pullin', stabbin' (what is your name?)
It's Hypnotiq how I got it, but I'ma glad that you came

[Chorus]

[Verse 4 - Mannie Fresh]
Slim Teresa, and Lakeisha (they some gangsta girls)
Tanya, Wanda, and Laneisha (they some gangsta girls)
'Bout fifty Kims all in Tims (gangsta girls)
A hundred shorties, all at parties (gangsta girls)
Full of drama, baby mama (she's a gangsta girl)
When they freakin' on the weekend (they some gangsta girls)
But they knowin' where they goin' (the gangsta girls)
Fly wheels, pay they bills (the gangsta girls)

[Chorus]
Here we all work 'long the Mississippi
Here we all work, while the white boys play
Gettin' no rest from the dawn till the sunset
Gettin' no rest till the judgment day

You don't look up, you don't look down
You don't dare make the rich boss frown
Bend your knees and bow your head
And tote that barge until you're dead

Let me go away from the Mississippi
Let me go away from the rich man boss
Show me that stream called the River of Jordan
That's the old stream that I long to cross

Old Man River, Old Man River
He don't say nothin', he must know somethin'
Old Man River, he just keeps rollin' along

You know, you know he don't plant taters
And we all know the man don't plant no cotton
And then, then they plant 'em
Oh the Lord knows they are soon forgotten
But Old Man River, he just keeps rollin' along
You, you and me, you know sometimes
We have to we have to sweat, sweat and strain
Our bodies, our bodies are all achin'
And wracked with a whole lot of pain

Tote that barge, lift that bale, you get a little drunk
And you land in jail

I get weary and so sick of tryin'
I'm tired of livin', and afraid of dyin'
But Old Man River, he just keeps rollin' a
Old Man River, he just keeps rollin' along
Never treats me sweet and gentle the way she should
I got it bad and that ain't good
My poor heart is sentimental, not made of wood
I got it bad and that ain't good

But when the weekend's over and Monday rolls around
I end up like I start out, just cryin' my heart out

Doesn't love me like I love her, no, nobody could
I got it bad and that ain't good

Like a lonely weepin' willow who's lost in the wood
I got it bad and that ain't good
And the things I tell my pillow, nobody should
I got it bad, I got I bad, and it's no good

Though folks with good intentions, they tell me to save up my tears
I'm glad I'm mad about her, I can't live without her

Lord above, make her love me the way that she should
I got it bad and that ain't good
I got it bad and that ain't good
No good
No good
No good
No good
Everybody has the right to be wrong at least once
Everybody has the right to be dunce-like, once-like
Not being too smart is, is no disgrace
What sets you apart is smilin' with egg on your face

Its naive to make believe that you're right, it's not bright
Only fools go walking on thin ice, twice

You and life can skip the strife and you'll both get along
All it takes is simply saying you're wrong when you're wrong
And everybody has the right to be wrong

You and life can skip the strife and you'll both get along
All it takes is simply sayin' you're wrong when you're wrong
And everybody has the right to be
It can be a real delight to be
And I'd fight, fight for the right to be wrong

"At least once!!"
The world is turning
I hope it don't turn away
The world is turning
I hope it don't turn away
All my pictures are falling from the wall where I placed them yesterday
The world is turning
I hope it don't turn away
I need a crowd of people
But I can't face them day to day
I need a crowd of people
But I can't face them day to day
Though my problems are meaningless, that don't make them go away
I need a crowd of people
But I can't face them day to day
I went to the radio interview, but I ended up alone at the microphone
I went to the radio interview, but I ended up alone at the microphone
Now I'm living out here on the beach, but those seagulls are still out of reach
I went to the radio interview, but I ended up alone at the microphone
Get out of town, think I'll get out of town
Get out of town, think I'll get out of town
I head for the sticks with my bus and friends
I follow the road, though I don't know where it ends
Get out of town, think I'll get out of town
Because the world is turning
I don't want to see it turn away
I was born in a cross-fire hurricane
And I howled at my ma in the driving rain
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right. I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas! Gas! Gas

I was raised by a toothless, bearded hag
I was schooled with a strap right across my back
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas! Gas! Gas

I was drowned, I was washed up and left for dead
I fell down to my feet and I saw they bled
I frowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I was crowned with a spike right thru my head
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right, I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash
It's a gas! Gas! Gas
Jumping Jack Flash, its a gas
Jumping Jack Flash, its a gas
Jumping Jack Flash, its a gas
Jumping Jack Flash, its a gas
Jumping Jack Flash

[Verse 1]
When I get up I've dreamt too long
Everything else is half as strong
I could see though, outside my head
They got it right, I got it wrong

[Chorus]
I've let too much of it slide through my fingers
Fear that has fouled all the love I could bring her

[Verse 2]
Shook off her optimistic hand
I am too fixed on what I've planned
Who is the one who can't let go?
I will miss out, hell, don't I know

[Chorus]
I've let too much of it slide through my fingers
Fear that has fouled all the love I could bring her
(All the love I could bring her)

[Chorus]
I've let too much of it slide through my fingers
Fear that has fouled all the love I could bring her
I've let too much of it slide through my fingers
Fear that has fouled all the songs I could sing her
I've let too much of it slide through my fingers

[Verse 1: Nathan Morris]
I was wrong beyond belief
Even the blindest man could see
That the choices that I've made
Would be the end of you and me
So I sit here all alone
I've been a mess since you've been gone
Now I hate myself like no one else
I know that I'm at fault
Truth is there's really no excuse
For what I did or didn't do
So sorry, I hope that you can find it in your heart to save

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Save one more dance for me
One last second chance for me
'Cause I don't want nobody cutting in
I swear I'll never break your heart again
Please don't let the music end
Could you just save me one more dance
One more dance (Dance), one more dance (Dance)

[Verse 2: Shawn Stockman]
Maybe I was just afraid
Of how good my life can be
So I messed things up and hurt you, girl
Before you could hurt me
I'm not saying I was right
I'm not so proud of what I did
Well, I'm not gon' lie, or try to justify
Or try to make it all make sense
Truth is there's really no excuse
For all I did or didn't do
So sorry, I hope that you can find it in your heart to save

[Chorus: Boyz II Men]
Save one more dance with me (One more)
One last second chance for me
'Cause I don't want nobody cutting in
I swear I'll never break your heart again
Please don't let the music end
Would you just save me one more dance
One more dance (Dance), one more dance (Dance)

[Bridge: Wanya Morris]
If there's a space in your heart
Please find the room to forgive
Let's try and make a new start, and begin
If you take the lead, I'll follow you
From this moment, I'll dance for you
Tell me I'm not dancing all alone, no

[Chorus: Boyz II Men, Wanya Morris]
Save one more dance with me
(Oh oh oh, save me one more dance)
One last second chance for me
(One more chance)
'Cause I don't want nobody cutting in
(I don't want nobody, no no no no no no)
I swear I'll never break your heart again
(I will never break, baby, don't you let the music end)
Please don't let the music end
(Please, baby)
Could you just save me one more dance
Save one more dance with me
(Oh oh, save me one more dance)
One last second chance for me
(One last, one last second chance)
'Cause I don't want nobody cutting in
(I don't want nobody cutting in)
I swear I'll never break your heart again
(Never, never, oh)
Please don't let the music end
Baby, just save me one more dance
One more dance, one more dance

[Outro: Boyz II Men]
One more dance
One more dance, one more dance
One more dance
One more dance, one more dance
One more dance
As we rowed up to Fennario
As we rowed up to Fennario
Our captain fell in love
With a lady like a dove
And he called her by name, Pretty Peggy-O
Come steppin' down the stairs Pretty Peggy-O
Come steppin' down the stairs Pretty Peggy-O
Come steppin' down the stairs, holding back your yellow hair
In the hand??? ???, William-O
Will you marry me Pretty Peggy-O?
Will you marry me Pretty Peggy-O?
If you will marry me, I will set your cities free
And free all the people of the area-O
I would marry you sweet William-O
I would marry you sweet William-O
I would marry you but your guineas are too few
And I fear my mama would be angry-O
What would your mama think Pretty Peggy-O
What would your mama think Pretty Peggy-O
What would your mama think if she heard my guineas clink
Saw me riding at the head of my soldiers-O
If ever I return Pretty Peggy-O
If ever I return Pretty Peggy-O
If ever I return, all your cities I will burn
Destroy all the people in the area-O
Come steppin' down the stairs Pretty Peggy-O
Come steppin' down the stairs Pretty Peggy-O
Come steppin' down the stairs, holding back your yellow hair
Bid a last farewell to your William-O
Sweet William he is dead Pretty Peggy-O
Sweet William he is dead Pretty Peggy-O
Sweet William he is dead and he died for a maid
And he spent the loot he had in the country-O
As we rowed up to Fennario
As we rowed up to Fennario
Our captain fell in love
With a lady like a dove
And he called her by name, Pretty Peggy-O
Lost in a boat on the ocean, lost in a ship out at sea
Lost in the dark of misfortune, where is a light I can see?
Where is the highway to heaven, where is the love we all need?
Where is the peace that we long for, where is the man who is free?
Here in the heart there is freedom, here in the heart there is peace
Here in the heart is the answer to questions much deeper than these
You've got to hold on tightly, let go lightly. It's only surrender, it's all in the game
If you just hold on tightly, let go lightly, there's always forgiveness and no one to blame

Some will take fame over fortune, some will take love over gold
Some will pray only for power, some never want to grow old
Some see the day that is coming, some only see what has passed
Someone will always be first in line, someone will always be last
Here in the heart there is freedom, here in the heart there is peace
Here in the heart is the answer to questions much deeper than these
You've got to hold on tightly, let go lightly. It's only surrender, it's all in the game
If you just hold on tightly, let go lightly, there's always forgiveness and no one to blame
You've got to hold on tightly, let go lightly. It's only surrender, it's all in the game
If you just hold on tightly, let go lightly, there's always forgiveness and no one to blame

[Verse 1]
Don't be that way
Don't you pretend
You're not awake
When you know you are
I see the way
You're lying there
I know you can't
Be very far

[Pre-Chorus 1]
God wouldn’t do that
He knows how I feel
I can’t go through that
And so it’s not real

[Chorus]
Life is still so beautiful
Life is still so beautiful

[Verse 2]
Don't be so still
You never are
You like to play
Your soul's on fire
I don't believe this is the end
And I still feel your heart's desire

[Pre-Chorus 2]
God couldn’t do that
He knows you belong
To me and me only
And so I’ll be strong

[Chorus]
Life is still so beautiful
Life is still so beautiful

[Bridge]
Come on boy, let's go
We can hit the road
We don't have to say
Where we're going
We can go anywhere
We can go anywhere
We can go anywhere
Right now

[Chorus]
Life is still so beautiful
Life is still so beautiful

It's very nice to go trav'ling
To Paris London and Rome
It's oh so nice to go trav'ling
But it's so much nicer, yes it's so much nicer to come home

It's very nice to just wander
The camel route to Iraq
It's oh so nice to just wander
But it's so much nicer, yes it's oh so nice to wander back

The mam'selles and frauleins and the señoritas are sweet
But they can't compete 'cause they just don't have
What the models have on Madison Ave

It's very nice to be footloose
With just a toothbrush and comb
It's oh so nice to be footloose
But your heart starts singin' when your homeward wingin' across the foam

And you know your fate is
Where the Empire State is
All you contemplate is
The view from Miss Liberty's dome
It's very nice to go trav'ling
But it's oh so nice to come home

You will find the maiden and the gay muchachas are rare
But they can't compare with that sexy line
That parades each day at Sunset and Vine

It's quite the life to play gypsy
And roam as gypsies will roam
It's quite the life to play gypsy
But your heart starts singin' when your homeward wingin' 'cross the foam

And the Hudson River
Makes you start to quiver
Like the latest flivver
That's simply drippin' with chrome

It's very nice to go trav'ling
But it's oh so nice to come home

No more customs
Burn the passport
No more packin'
And unpackin'
Light the home fires
Get my slippers
Make a pizza
Sunny days, I promised you
Life's window pain
With a perfect view
A vow to love, unconditional
Be there for you, all season

And baby I never meant to clip your wings, oh my love
And baby I never meant to clip your wings, oh my love
Baby I never meant to clip your wings, uh baby
Now I'm wishing you
You would fly right back to me, yeah

I made a vow, to walk with you
Through anything, life puts you through
Told you the world is yours and everything in it
Then you took your heart, for granted
And baby I never meant to clip your wings, never
Baby I never meant to clip your wings, uh baby
Baby I never meant to clip your wings, uh baby
Now I'm wishing you
You would fly right back to me, yeah
I was your eagle, you were my daffodil
And nothing would come between us, no, no, no
Now the fun and laughter, going to the park
And all the pictures we took
Now it's all gone away

And baby I never meant to clip your wings, oh my love
And baby I never meant to clip your wings, oh my love
And baby I never meant to clip your wings, uh baby
Now I'm wishing you
You would fly right back to me, yeah

Baby, baby, baby, baby
I never meant to clip your wings, oh my love
Baby girl I never
Meant to clip the wings of an angel
When I was supposed to love you baby
For eternity
Now I'm wishing you
You would fly right back to me
Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah, they were all yellow

I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called "Yellow"

So, then, I took my turn
Oh, what a thing to've done
And it was all yellow

Your skin
Oh, yeah, your skin and bones
Turn it into something beautiful
D'you know
You know I love you so
You know I love you so
I swam across
I jumped across for you
Oh, what a thing to do
Cause you were all yellow

I drew a line
I drew a line for you
Oh, what a thing to do
And it was all yellow

Your skin
Oh, yeah, your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
D'you know
For you, I'd bleed myself dry
For you, I'd bleed myself dry

It's true
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine

Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And all the things that you do

[Verse 1]
I think of tears, I think of rain on shingles
I think of rain, I think of roses blue
I think of Rose, my heart begins to tremble
To see the place she's lately gotten to
Gotten to, gotten to

[Verse 2]
She's gotten to mysterious devotions
She's gotten to the zodiac and Zen
She's gotten into tarot cards and potions
She's laying her religion on her friends
On her friends, on her friends

[Verse 3]
Friends who come to ask her for their future
Friends who come to find they can't be friends
Because of signs and seasons that don't suit her
She'll prophesy your death, she won't say when
Won't say when, won't say when

[Verse 4]
When all the black cards come you cannot barter
No, when all your stars are stacked you cannot win
She'll shake her head and treat you like a martyr
It is her blackest spell she puts you in
Puts you in, puts you in

[Verse 5]
In sorrow she can lure you where she wants you
Inside your own self-pity there you swim
In sinking down to drown her voice still haunts you
And only with your laughter can you win
Can you win, can you win

[Verse 6]
You win the lasting laurels with your laughter
It reaches like an arm before you sink
To win the solitary truth you're after
You dare not ask the priestess how to think
How to think, how to think

[Verse 7]
I think of tears, I think of rain on shingles
I think of rain, I think of roses blue
I think of Rose, my heart begins to tremble
To see the place she's lately gotten to
Gotten to, gotten to

[Verse 1]
Love put me on the corner
Love put me in the street
Love put me on the corner
Now I'm looking for someone else
I'm looking for someone else
I'm looking for someone, someone to love

[Verse 2]
Love put me on the corner
Love put me in the streets
Love put me on the corner
And I ain't had much time to sleep
Walkin' up and down the streets
My heart is aching down, down to my feet

[Bridge]
I'm on my way back where I don't belong
Pickin' up the broken pieces one by one
Standin' on this corner with a better view
Got to stay here 'til I find you

[Verse 3]
Love put me on a corner
Love put me in the streets
Love put me on a corner
And I'm looking for someone else
I've been checking into myself
I'm looking for someone, someone to love

People have you heard of the world plan
To know the inner nature of every man
Jesus came down to save the world from sin
Sayin' "Seek ye first the kingdom within"
Maharishi teaches us to meditate
To dive deep within come out and radiate
All of the saints through all creation
Sing the same song of revelation

Hey-yon-du-coma-nauga-ton

[Verse 1]
There's a Christmas tree in a window frame
Just inside my door
But my Christmas tree doesn't look the same
As it always has before
There's just one lonely present
Beneath my Christmas tree
'Cause the best little present a guy could have
Has gone away from me

[Verse 2]
Oh, my Christmas tree isn't very big
In fact, it's kind of small
Oh, it's funny when she'd pick them out
They'd always seem so tall
The light doesn't seem so bright this year
It's hard for me to see
The smile that made my Christmas right
Has gone away from me

[Bridge]
I have been so lonely
Since you left me all alone
All I want for Christmas
Is my baby, my baby back home

[Verse 3]
Oh my Christmas tree is so sad and bare
My room so big and cold
Oh, they wish me Happy New Year
But the new year's already old
There's no, no little angel
On top where she used to be
'Cause the angel that made my Christmas right
Has gone away from me

[Outro]
'Cause the angel that made my Christmas right
Has gone away from me
'Cause the angel that made my Christmas right
Has gone away from me

We need a shake and therefore demand more than the cold conclusion of reason
The only impossible thing is to delimit the impossible

The realm of necessity (to restore the confidence)
Is the triumph of human spirit (triumph of the will)

Everything remains to be done
To devastate the ideas of family, famine and religion

Do do do do do do do do do do, do do do do do

I wanna scream, but no one's around. My baby's loving, Lord, she's carrying on
Some people may say
That some people I love you
And, some people may find
That some people weren't true
And some people may vow
That they'll never part
And people promise people
That they will never break their hearts

I thank heaven up above
Cos' we just keep on lovin
We just keep on kissin'
We just keep on huggin'
We just keep on waitin'

Somethings never change

And the flowers bloom in may
For as long as I am breathing my heart will always stay
I tell you somethings never change
In the springtime it will rain
And the world going round and round
There's nothing new
And thats how I feel about you
Now, some people believe
That, some people will be there
And, some poeple came to see
That some people didn't care
Sooo-ooo-ooome people may think that
They can trust some people
But some people come to find
That the people that they thought they knew they really dont know know-know-oooh-ooo
When it comes to us (when it comes to us) I thank heaven up up
Cos we keep on lovin'
We just keep on kissin'
We just keep on touchin'

Help me out babe, get down low
But I can't remember things I used to know
The Lord knows I'm to blame

Well, along with our special feature of this Beach Boys' Christmas Album
Once again I'm happy to see the smiling face of the leader of
This popular group here in the studio, Brian Wilson
Good to see you again, Brian

Hi, Jack

This Beach Boys' Christmas Album is really something
Ah, Dick Reynolds did the arrangements, I guess, huh?

Yes, he did. He did a beautiful job, a wonderful job

Is this the first time you've worked with him?

Right. I'd been, uh, wanting to meet him and work with him for quite a long time

Now who's idea was it to have you featured on this, uh, one particular tune--I
I was particularly impressed with it--"A Blue Christmas."

Well, I... sort of picked out that song to sing for myself
I, I love the song and uh, I've always wanted to sing it, so I thought I'd sing it
Well, maybe this will be the start of a whole new career, huh?

I don't know, that's... It, it could, and it couldn't. Ah... I really don't know

Well, let's leave it to the listeners to see what they think of it

Right

I notice this album has uh, ah, along with some of the popular things like, uh
"I'll Be Home For Christmas," uh, "Auld Lang Syne," and uh, um, "We Three Kings"
And some of the traditional things, that you have a couple of your
Your own, uh, Beach Boys type sounds in the LP, too

Uh-huh, we've more or less made one side, uh, our own style, and...

Kind of a teen side and an adult side

Uh-huh, right, um-hm. Contrasting

Uh-huh. Now, we have, uh, one of your originals coming up here, Brian
Uh, "Christmas Day." You wrote this for the album specifically?

Yes, I did. Uh-huh

Uh-huh. And now, do you do your, the vocal arrangements
Or did Dick Reynolds handle all of that?
Dick handled the vocal arrangements on the, ah, the modern side
--the traditional side--and I did the, ah, vocal and the
Arrangements of the music on our own style--our basic style--side
Dick did the strings, also, on the, uh, on the modern side

Coming up now, ah, a very sentimental type Christmas song
Particularly for those who are away from home during this time of year
--"I'll Be Home For Christmas." Any, ah, thing particular about this
This tune that you'd like to say, Brian?

Ah, well, I guess there's something very obvious when you hear the song
It's, ah, there's a very definite influence of the Four Freshmen
On the arrangement as well as the delivery, and, uh, obviously
We all look up and admire the style of the Four Freshmen and
Uh, I feel this has been the greatest--one of the greater--
Vocal influences, ah, in the world today

Well, it's certainly been, uh, nice of you to take the time to come
By again here for our special Beach Boys' Christmas show
You have a fine album here and, uh, I hope you'll be home for Christmas

Well, I hope I will, too. I hope everyone's home for Christmas

I do, too. Brian Wilson, thanks again for coming by

Thank you very much, Jack
And here again, the Beach Boys' Christmas Album

But I don't have 2 spank U cuz this is my ship
Get off {x2}

(Get off, baby)

I will still be hip
When the words from your lip take a dip in the ratings
Then I'll be stripping your Mercedes off your Lubricated Lady
And taking her 4 a walk, taking her 4 a walk
On the positive tip
I'm equipped with a whip
I don't have 2 spank U cuz this is my ship
Get off {x4}

Ooh, is this a dream?
No - everybody get off
Is this a dream? {x2}
Get-a-get-a-get-a-get off

CHORUS

(I got the bed 4 U)
Get off (Hey, hey sugar)
Get off

(Get off) {repeat in BG}
Once I give her back 2 ya
She won't ever wanna do ya
Cuz I wrote the book
I taught her how 2 look
She showed me the money U gave her - I took
I even ate her cooking
That's more than U did

Get off {x2}
What can a brother do when the clock keeps ticking U off?
Turn the other cheek or kick a nut till he cough, "Get off" (Ooh, help me)
"Get off" (Get off)

Get off {sampled}
New Power {sampled}

Everybody get off {x2}

Is this a dream? {x2}
Get-a-get-a-get-a-get off

CHORUS

(I got the bed 4 U)
Get off (Hey, hey sugar)
Get off

What can a brother do when the clock keeps ticking U off?
Turn the other cheek or kick a nut till he cough, "Get off" (Ooh, help me)
"Get off" (Oh)

Get off {repeat and sampled}

Everything alright back there
(feat. Chimere)

[Chimere]
Ooh, hey yeah
Do you know how to leave, ride...ride

[Verse 1]
Ya see, it started off in St. Paul from the street of Old Nash
And it feels so good to escape and just kick it and laugh
My clan had to bring the ruckus cause we had the cream
All you can eat over at Ryan's or some fish at Gaseen's
And I had to fix a good bag and make decisions and haste
Cause soul food ain't the motherfuckin' thang to waste
So let's get looney up on the set cause I got five on the fire
Will slide to East Point and make our way to Black Rirer
Lookin' like Outkast on the spot smokin' blunts and
Hit the liquor store got up, got out and got something
That eightball, so I can do some space age pimpin'
My blood stay young off 45's Colt and chicken
Camels and Rolls filled with d's and Vogues
And playas mackin' them hoes, in dyke clothes
Comin' up slammin' Caddy doors
In Southwest, we'll take it to yo chest
And we got it locked like some niggas on house arrest
Cause we ridin'

[Chorus: Chimere]
Ridin' on that midnight train to Georgia, riiide
Ridin' on that midnight train to Georgia, riiide

[Verse 2]
It's just one of those days when I can kick it like this and like that
It's a free day, my folks got rowdy way back
I right off of Cascade or Ralph David Abernathy
I shall proceed and continue to keep my roots nappy
Cause afros in all seasons, they keep me warm
Some livin' that thug life so how long will they mourn
I still ride, that's why I bounce my way to bank-bed
I'm so bad that I'll knock you out, that's what my mama said
Sippin' on brandy, sunny days with my best friends
Today you see and then you cruise through the West end
They should've said it was Six Flags Over Georgia
Then underground, my Tuesdays would be packed when I got older
If I told you one, I told ya ass a thousand times
I got em' all in check when it comes to bustin' rhymes
Don't sweat the technique cause I just move the crowd
My mob's deep of alcoholics, people label us loud because we ride

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
See I felt my bones jump as I crossed the road
I heard the squad was wiped up so I flipped my mode
On my way to D-E-C, baby can't you see
That Decatur is totally to B-I-G for thee
Lost Boyz ridin' around in Jeeps, Lex Luth's, and Beamers
Yo cars get scooped just like Regina carpet cleaners
It's Stone Mountain Cats puttin' it down
They played Kurupt so I just gave all my dogs a pound
Now my conflict was crucial off some hay I smoked
I should be gettin' it cause life is too got damn short
And now my mind's playin' tricks and my boys actin' ghetto
Back to the C-P, I put the pedal to the metal
God bless the child that's just got his own
Since I was a juvenile makin' cash money at home
I'm from a boy to a man, I've reached the end of my road
It's Ludacris signin' off till the next episode, let's ride

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Cause it's the A-T-L
Where all the pimps and the playas just dwell
We get the cash and the ass then bail
We leave a trace but never leave a trail
Say it again
Where all the pimps and the playas just dwell
We get the cash and the ass then bail
We leave a trace but never leave a trail

[Chimere ad-libs to fade]
As you desire me, so shall I come to you
Howe'er you wander, so shall I be
Be it forever, or be it just a day
As you desire me, come what may
I doubt not but you will do what you will with me
I give my life to you 'cause you're my destiny
And now, come take me, my soul is yours
As you desire me, I come to you
And now, come take me, my very soul is yours
As you desire me, I come to you

[Intro]
Each day you've got someone new
A new heart to break and leave feeling blue
Fortunate are you for you're a beautiful girl
Guys just can't pass you by
Ooh, but I can, my friend
I'm the exception to the rule

[Verse 1]
Oh, I know you think that I'm just acting the part
Yes, you do, girl
Of a guy with a cold, cold heart
And it won't take long
For you to capture me
With your innocent but meaningful plea
But you won't capture me
I'm the exception to the rule

[Bridge]
You tell me "Darling, that's, that's where you're wrong"
That your love for me is so strong
It will soon, very soon, make me give in
And girl, I know that nine guys out of every ten
I know they want ya, they want you to be their woman
But take a look, take a good look
There, there I am, there I am again, that one in ten

[Verse 2]
So it's useless for you to try and change me, rearrange me
Girl, because I won't give in, my friend
You can fool all the guys with those lines
About you being so sweet and kind

[Outro]
But oh no, no, no, not me
I'm the exception to the rule (Give it up)
I'm one guy you can't fool (Give it up)
No matter what you say or what you do (Give it up)
Girl, I'm that one guy you can't fool (Give it up)
Oh, sometimes
I get a good feeling, yeah
Get a feeling that I never, never, never, never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah
Oh, sometimes
I get a good feeling, yeah
Get a feeling that I never, never, never, never had before, no no
I get a good feeling, yeah

[Pitbull]
Mr. Worldwide
El que no es consejo, no llega el viejo
So listen up

Ooh la la la
If your girl wanna play, let her go, so let her go (la la la la)
If your girl wanna play, let her go, so let her go (la la la la)
If your girl wanna play, let her go, so let her go (la la la la)
If your girl wanna play, let her go

[Pitbull]
Make money, make money - this chico right here gotta eat, baby
You scared money - don't make money, that's how it goes in the street, baby
But enough about the nonsense, baby girl take a shot clear your conscience
Not a goon or a goblin, I'm a monster
Cause I hit all the baddest women in the world - gangsta

Ooh baby, baby, la la la la la la la
Ooh baby, baby, la la la la la la la

[T-Pain]
Ooh drop it to the floor, make me wanna say it
Yeah you can shake some more, make you wanna say it
Ooh you got it, because you make me wanna say
Don't stop it - I want you tonight
Your sweet expression, the smile you gave me, the way you looked when we met
It's easy to remember, but so hard to forget
I hear you whisper, I'll always love you, I know it's over and yet
It's easy to remember, but so hard to forget
So I must dream to have your hands caress me, fingers press me tight
I'd rather dream than have that lonely feeling stealing through the night
Each little moment is clear before me, and though it brings me regret
It's easy to remember but so hard to forget

[Verse 1]
Cold bologna, and I'm home by myself
Well, I'm 5 years old, and it sho' is cold
Mama's out cookin' steak for someone else

Sure am sleepy, but I'm gonna wait 'til my mama comes
Well, if the rich folks don't eat up
All that good meat, y'all, mama's gonna bring me some

[Chorus]
Talkin' bout that
Cold bolonga and mayonnaise and bread
If it wasn't for cold bologna by now (Cold bologna)
Y'all know I would've been dead

[Verse 2]
Mama sure looks tired
She said, "what's that you eatin', son?"
"That bologna sandwich sure looks good --
Won't you Ahh, Owww, fix your mama one?"

[Chorus]
Talkin' bout that
Cold bolonga and mayonnaise and bread (Cold bologna)
If it wasn't for cold bologna by now (Cold bologna)
Y'all know I would've been dead

[Bridge]
Bologna was good enough (Good enough) for my father
Good enough (Good enough) for my mother
That bologna saved me (Saved me) and my brother
Oh yes, it did

[Outro]
(Cold bologna) Cold bologna (Cold bologna)
Mayonnaisse and bread (Cold bologna)
Cold bologna (Cold bologna)
You know I would've been dead (Cold bologna)
Cold bologna (Cold bologna)
Cold bologna ah, yeah now (Cold bologna)
Cold bologna (Cold bologna)
Mayonnaisse and bread (Cold bologna)
If it wasn't for (Cold bologna) cold bologna
I would've been dead (Cold bologna)
Cold bologna
You go to my head and you linger like a haunting refrain
And I find you spinning 'round in my brain
Like the bubbles in a glass of champagne
You go to my head like a sip of sparkling Burgundy brew
And I find the very mention of you
Like the kicker in a julep or two

The thrill of the thought that you might give a thought to my plea
Cast a spell over me
Still I say to myself get a hold of yourself
Can't you see that it never can be

You go to my head with a smile that makes my temperature rise
Like a summer with a thousand Julys
You intoxicate my soul with your eyes
Though I'm certain that this heart of mine
Hasn't a ghost of a chance in this crazy romance
You go to my head
You go to my head
Last night a little dancer came dancin to my door
Last night a little angel came pumping on the floor
She said, "Come on baby, Ive got a license for love
And if it expires, pray help from above because"
In the midnight hour, she cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell, she cried more, more, more
In the midnight hour, babe, more, more, more
With a rebel yell, more, more, more, more, more, more
She dont like slavery, she won't sit and beg
But when Im tired and lonely, she sees me to bed
What sets you free and brought you to me, babe
What sets you free, I need you here by me because
In the midnight hour, she cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell, she cried more, more, more
In the midnight hour, babe, more, more, more
With a rebel yell, more, more, more
He lives in his own heaven
Collects it to go from the Seven Eleven
Well, hes out all night to collect a fare
Just so long, just so long, it dont mess up his hair
I walked the walk for you, babe
A thousand miles for you
I dried your tears of pain, babe
A million times for you
Id sell my soul for you, babe
For money to burn for you
Id give you all and have none, babe
Just-a, just-a, just-a, just-a
To have you here by me because
In the midnight hour, she cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell, she cried more, more, more
In the midnight hour, babe, more, more, more
With a rebel yell, she cried more, more, more, more, more, more
Ooh yeah, a little baby, she want more
More, more, more, more, more
Ooh yeah, a little angel, she want more
More, more, more, more, more
Maybe you've got your mind made up
Don't know where to start
Or maybe you hold your painted cup
Too close to your heart
What about what you said today
That was all you ever had to say
No one else ever made it sound just that way

Take your places
Show your faces

Days break with out takes and accidents
Your baby cries your lovers lie
You must make sense
But all you ever had to do
Is do what you have to do
And you're the only one who knows
Just exactly what that is

Take your places
Show your faces
Without you dear there's nothing here
It's all a mystery
So stay right there and take good care
Just for me

Nothing will ever take your place
Nothing will ever take your place

Thoughts and day dreams fill the air
They fly around like birds
And I can sing you melodies
And they just sound like words
Wanna know what they say
You overhear it everyday
You're the one we've been hearing all about

Take your places
Show your faces

Without you dear there's nothing here
It's all a mystery
So stay right there and take good care
Just for me

Nothing will ever take your place
Nothing will ever take your place
There will be many other nights like this
And I'll be standing here with someone new
There will be other songs to sing, another fall, another spring
But there will never be another you
There will be other lips that I may kiss
But they won't thrill me like yours used to do
Yes, I may dream a million dreams
But how can they come true
If there will never ever be another you
When you're lost in the rain
In Juarez and it's Easter time too
When you're gravity's down
And negativity won't pull you through
Don't you put on any airs
When you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue
They got some hungry creatures there
Surely make a mess out of you

Well, if you see St. Annie
Please tell her, "thanks a lot"
My hair was twisted
And my stocks, woo-hoo, are all in a knot
I don't even have the strength
To get up and crawl across the floor for another shot
And my best friend, my drummer
Won't even tell me, what it was that I dropped

Yeah, sweet Melinda
The peasants call her the Goddess of Gloom
She has, speaks good English
As she invites you up into her room
And you, you were so kinda conscientious
Not to go to her too soon
But she steals your voice
And leaves you howling at the moon

[Instrumental break]

Up on Housing Project Hill
It's either fortune or fame
You must choose one or the other
But neither are to be what they claim
If you're looking to get silly
You better get back to from where you came
Because the cops don't need you ever
And they expect the same

I started out on Heineken
But I soon hit the harder stuff
Everybody swore they stand beside me
When the game got rough
But the joke was on me
There wasn't even anybody there to bluff
I'm goin' back to New York City
I do believe I've had enough
There's a full moon over India and Gandhi lives again
Who's to say you have to lose for someone else to win
In the eyes of all the people the look is much the same
For the first is just the last one when you play a deadly game

It's about time we realize it we're all in this together
It's about time we find out it's all of us or none
It's about time we recognize it these changes in the weather
It's about time, it's about changes and it's about time

There's a light in the Vatican window for all the world to see
And a voice cries in the wilderness and sometimes he speaks for me
I suppose I love him most of all when he kneels to kiss the land
With his lips upon our Mother's breast he makes his strongest stand

It's about time we start to see it the Earth is our only home
It's about time we start to face it we can't make it here all alone
It's about time we start to listen to the voices in the wind
It's about time, it's about changes and it's about time

There's a man who is my brother, I just don't know his name
But I know his home and family because I know we feel the same
And it hurts me when he's hungry and when his children cry
I too am a father and that little one is mine
It's about time we begin to turn the world around
It's about time we start to make it the dream we've always known
It's about time we start to live the family of man
It's about time, it's about changes and it's about time
It's about peace and it's about plenty and it's about time
It's about you and me together and it's about time
Need someone's hand to lead me through the night
I need someone's arms to hold and squeeze me tight
Now, when the night begins, whoa, I'm at an end
Because I need your love so bad

I need some lips to feel next to mine
Need someone to stand up - to stand up and tell me when I'm lyin'
And when the lights are low - and it's time to go
That's when I need your love so bad

So why don't you give it up, baby and bring it home to me
Or write it on a piece of paper, woman - so it can be read to me
Tell me that you love me - and stop drivin' me mad
Whoa, because I - I need your love so bad

Need a soft voice - just to talk to me at night
Don't want you to worry, baby
I know we can make everything alright
Listen to my plea, baby, come on bring it to me
'Cause I need - your love so bad
Baby, I need, I need - woman, I need your love so bad
(Dead like Elvis) {sample repeated in song}
Check, check, 1 2, check
U know what he's sayin'?

Face down! {x2}

Somebody once told him that he wouldn't take Prince through the ringer
Let him go down as a washed up singer
Ain't that a bitch?
Thinkin' all along that he wanted 2 be rich
Never respected the root of all evil and he still don't 2 this day, huh
Bury him face down, let the motherfuckers kiss a ass, OK?

Face down! {x2}

Told 'em he wanted 2 sing a song about a black child goin' buck wild
And they just laughed in his face
Talk 2 your lawyer but U got no case
What U need 2 do is keep your place
Next time U pull a card, it better be a ace motherfucker
Or U can lay face down (Face down!)
1 2
Face down! 1 2

Horn {x2}
Bass {x2}

Him and her meaning who I'm singin' about
And his psychoanalyst kinda saw the catalyst
As the devil with the blue jeans on, huh
Ain't it kinda funny when U see the dawn?
Sign the name they gave ya
But when them motherfuckers turn around ass up, U're what?

Face down! 1 2
Face down! New Power Generation in the house, bury 'em all
Face down! Yes, oh Lord
Face down!

Orchestra {x3}
Face down!

Face down!

It's in his will, I read it
He shot 2 kill, he said it
4 those who know the number and don't call
Hmph, fuck all y'all
Face down! {x3}
From the great Atlantic ocean to the wide Pacific shore
She climbs a flowery mountains o'er the hills and by the shore
She's mighty tall and handsome she's known quite well by all
She's a regular combination on the Wabash Cannonball

Listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland o'er the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear those lonesome hoboes call
Traveling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball

Well she came down from Birmingham one cold December day
As she pulled into the station you could hear all the people say
She's from Tennessee she's long and she's tall
She came down from Birmingham on the Wabash Cannonball

Listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland o'er the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear those lonesome hoboes call
Traveling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball

Here's to daddy Claxton may his name forever stand
And always be remembered in the courts throughout the land
His earthly race is over and the curtains round him fall
We'll carry him home to Dixie on the Wabash Cannonball
Listen to the jingle, the rumble and the roar
As she glides along the woodland o'er the hills and by the shore
Hear the mighty rush of the engine hear those lonesome hoboes call
Traveling through the jungle on the Wabash Cannonball

If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks
I hope that you like this
But you probably won't
You think you're cooler than me

You got designer shades just to hide your face and
You wear 'em around like
You're cooler than me
And you never say "hey" or remember my name, and
It's probably cause you think you're cooler than me

You got your highbrow shoes on your feet
And you wear them around like it ain't shh
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise
Shh

I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Behind your makeup nobody knows who you even are
Or who you think that you are
If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks
I hope that you like this
But you probably won't
You think you're cooler than me

You got designer shades just to hide your face and
You wear 'em around like
You're cooler than me
And you never say "hey" or remember my name, and
It's probably cause you think you're cooler than me

You got your highbrow switch in your walk
And you don't even look when you pass by
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise
Shh

I got you all figured out
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen
Behind your makeup nobody knows who you even are
Or who you think that you are

Cause it sure seems (it sure seems)
You got no doubt (that you got no doubts)
But we all see (we all see)
You got your head in the clouds
If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm (under my arm)
I used up all my tricks
I hope that you like this
But you probably won't
You think you're cooler than me

You got designer shades just to hide your face and
You wear them around like
You're cooler than me
And you never say "hey" or remember my name, and
It's probably cause you think you're cooler than me

[Verse 1]
The other night dear, as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms
When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
So I bowed my head and I cried

[Chorus]
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I've always loved you and made you happy
And nothing else could come between
But now you've left me to love another
You have shattered all of my dreams

[Chorus]
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

[Spoken Outro]
(Oh, that's how you get through the verse)
*Laughter*
It was a nice short version
Do you wanna- uh, pick it up?
I't's alright (It's good)
(We got a short version)
It might have that other verse on it in another take
Well, I'll tell you what... Let's... uhm...
Well, if I feel like my song's a song... *Laughter*
It don't care... (There you go!)
I don't care if it's short
And I feel like my song's a song
A pleasure! Two minutes... I've recorded songs two minutes
(They were huge hits!)
Have you got, uh, time on that?
The late show is over
And the city is fast asleep
And I'm lost in a world
That's just too cold and deep
I've turned so many ways
I'm spinning like a top
I wish that I could get off
Or get this world to stop

I'm a stranger and afraid
I'm a stranger and afraid
I'm a stranger and afraid
In a world I never made

I'm always chasing dragons
With a sword that's made of tin
So I know in my soul
There's no way I can win
I tried, oh I tried
But there's no place, no place to go
There's no one here who knows me
And no one here I know
I'm a stranger and afraid
I'm a stranger and afraid
I'm a stranger and afraid
In a world I never made

[Verse 1]
Michael wakes you up with sweets
He takes you up streets and the rain comes down
Sidewalk markets locked up tight
And umbrellas bright on a grey background
There's oil on the puddles in taffeta patterns
That run down the drain
In colored arrangements that Michael will change
With a stick that he found

[Chorus]
Michael from mountains
Go where you will go to
Know that I will know you
Someday I may know you very well

[Verse 2]
Michael brings you to a park
He sings and its dark when the clouds come by
Yellow slickers up on swings
Like puppets on strings hanging in the sky
They'll splash home to suppers in wallpapered kitchens
Their mothers will scold
But Michael will hold you to keep away cold
Till the sidewalks are dry

[Chorus]
Michael from mountains
Go where you will go to
Know that I will know you
Someday I may know you very well

[Verse 3]
Michael leads you up the stairs
He needs you to care and you know you do
Cats come crying to the key
And dry you will be in a towel or two
There's rain in the window
There's sun in the painting that smiles on the wall
You want to know all but his mountains have called
So you never do

[Chorus]
Michael from mountains
Go where you will go to
Know that I will know you
Someday I may know you very well
Someday I will know you very well
Supreme and celestial
Elevated vertical
Grandiose proportions
Inspire greatness generosity
Mountain of health mountain salvation
Inaccessible, difficult to be found
Tending by the peak towards oneness
Where contradictions don't exist
The all embracing image of totality
I'm blue every Monday thinkin' over Sunday
That one day when I'm with you
It seems that I sigh all day Tuesday, I cry all day Wednesday
Oh my, how I long for you

And then comes Thursday, gee, it's long, it never gets by
Friday makes me feel like I'm gonna die
But after payday is my fun day, I shine all day Sunday
That one day when I'm with you

And then comes Thursday, gee, it's long, it never goes by
And Friday makes me feel like I'm gonna die
But after payday is my fun day, I shine all day Sunday
That one day when I'm with you

That one day, it's a fun day
Sunday is my day with you
Amor, amor, amor, this word so sweet that I repeat means "I adore you"
Amor, amor, my love, would you deny this heart that I have placed before you?

I can't find another word with meaning so clear
My lips try to whisper sweeter things in your ear
But somehow or other nothing sounds quite so dear
As this soft caressing word I know

Amor, amor, my love, when you're away there is no day and nights are lonely
Amor, amor, my love, make life divine, say you'll be mine, and love me only

I can't find another word with meaning so clear
My lips try to whisper sweeter things in your ear
But somehow or other nothing sounds quite so dear
As this soft caressing word I know

Amor, amor, my love, when you're away there is no day and nights are lonely
Amor, amor, my love, make life divine, say you'll be mine, and love me only

[Verse 1: Bret]
There's children on the street using guns and knives
They're taking drugs and each other's lives
Killing each other with knives and forks
And calling each other names like 'dork'

[Verse 2: Jemaine]
There's people on the street getting diseases from monkeys
Yeah, that's what I said - they're getting diseases from monkeys
Now there's junkies with monkey disease
Who's touching these monkeys, please
Leave these poor sick monkeys alone
They've got problems enough as it is

[Verse 3: Bret]
Man's lying on the street
Some punk's chopped off his head
I'm the only one who stops
To see if he's dead
Mmm, turns out he's dead

[Chorus]
And that's why I'm singing
What…what is wrong with the world today?
What is wrong with the world today?
(Jemaine mumbles)
What…what is wrong with the world today?
You gotta think about it
Think think about it

[Verse 4: Bret and (Jemaine)]
Good cops been framed and put into a can
All the money that we're making is going to the man
(What man?
Which man?
Who's the man?
When's a man a man?
What makes a man a man?
Am I a man?
Yes, technically I am)

[Verse 5: Jemaine]
They're turning kids into slaves just to make cheaper sneakers
But what's the real cost?
Cause the sneakers don't seem that much cheaper
Why are we still paying so much for sneakers
When you got them made by little slave kids
What are your overheads?

[Verse 6: Bret and (Jemaine)]
Well, at the end of your life, you're lucky if you die
Sometimes I wonder why we even try
I saw a man lying on the street half dead
With knives and forks sticking out of his leg
And he said
"Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
Can somebody get that knife and fork out of my leg, please?
(Can somebody please remove these cutleries from my knees?)"

[Outro: Bret and Jemaine]
And then we break it down
Yeah...ooh-ohh...This is the acapella jams
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...
Yeah, yeah...
Yeah-yeah-yaah-aah-ahh-ahh-ahh

Breakin' it down

To a secret mission town

Nobody Knows My Name Lyrics

Afro, man I know that you live in Mississippi now, but why in the hell did you leave Los Angeles man? I don't understand that

Walking down the street without getting shot takes everything you got(That's right). A bullet proof vess across your chess sure would help a lot.(That's true, I know that's right). When you like to get away pyu

Sometimes you wanna go where nobody knows your name (I know that's right)
They call the cops because you can. (Up against the wall black boy)

I wanna be where I can see, nobody will recognize me. I wanna go where nobody knows my name

Where the hell is that?

Haddysburg. Mississippi, next exit. In stereo where ever available. Baaakaaaa. Deeaaaaa
My girl
Is violin and candlelight
My girl
Is star-shine on a summer night
Lucky heart to be part of a love like this
Where every single kiss is a shortcut to heaven

Heaven knows
She's everything that's dear to me
She smiles
And cloudy days are clear to me
Yes, the world is my oyster and I've got the pearl
And I'm happy 'cause I've got my girl

My girl
Is autumn days and skies of gold
A fire to dream by
When the night is cold
Yes, the world is my oyster and I've got the pearl
I'm happy 'cause I've got my girl

[Verse 1]
Every Friday night I call your butt up on the phone
A deeper voice answers and says you're not at home
Now if you think that I'm a fool who'll go for any line
Then, honey, put down all your money, you win every time

[Chorus]
Irresistible bitch
I love the way you walk
Irresistible bitch
I love the way you talk
Irresistible bitch
And I really dig the way you kiss
Irresistible
Oh mama, I wish I could resist

[Verse 2]
All my partners ask me why I take so much abuse
Why am I so faithful, honey? Why are you so loose?
They say why am I the one who never gets to take you home?
But they don't know the things you do to me when we're alone

[Chorus]
Irresistible bitch
I love the way you walk
Irresistible bitch
I love the way you talk
Irresistible bitch
And I really dig the way you kiss
Irresistible
Oh mama, I wish I could resist

Hurt me, hurt me

[Post-Chorus]
Stole all my honey
Played it off like it was a joke
You're stealing all my honey, baby, keep you by my side
Bleed me till I'm broke

[Verse 3]
Hell if I know why I let you drive my car
Don't I know that walking won't get me very far?
Sure I know that crying over you is just in vain
But all things I lose don't add up to all the things I gain

[Chorus]
Irresistible bitch
I love the way you walk
Irresistible bitch
I love the way you talk
Irresistible bitch
And I really dig the way you kiss
Ain't it a shame?
Irresistible
Oh mama, mama, I wish I could resist
Hurt me!

[Post-Chorus]
Stole all my honey
Played it off like it was a joke
Stealing all my honey, baby, keep you by my side
Bleed me till I'm broke

[Outro]
Everybody, everybody dance
Everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody dance
Everybody
Irresistible bitch
Irresistible bitch
Everybody, everybody dance
Everybody
Irresistible bitch
Everybody, everybody dance
Everybody
Irresistible bitch

The leaves of brown
Came tumbling down
Remember in September in the rain
The sun went out
Just like a light
Remember in September in the rain

To every word
Of love I heard you whisper
The raindrops seems
To play a sweet refrain

Thought it's spring
To me it's still September
Oh that September in the rain

To every word
Of love I heard you whisper
The raindrops seems
To play a sweet refrain
Thought it's spring
To me it's still September
Oh that September in the rain
I said I said it's September in the rain
Ah September in the rain
Oh baby, whatcha gonna do
Oh baby, whatcha gonna do
I'm sick and tired of foolin' around with you

Wake up in the mornin' fix you somethin' to eat
'fore I go to work I even brush your teeth
Get home in the evenin' and you're still in bed
Got yourself a rag tied 'round you're head

Oh baby, whatcha gonna do
I'm sick and tired of foolin' around with you

I'm tellin' you baby you'd better change your ways
I'm tellin' you baby I mean what I say
Last time tellin you to stop that jive
Gonna find yourself outside

Oh baby, whatcha gonna do
I'm sick and tired of foolin' around with you

Last time tellin' you baby you'd better change your ways
Last time tellin' you baby I mean what I say
Last time tellin you to stop that jive
Gonna find yourself outside
Oh baby, whatcha gonna do
I'm sick and tired of foolin' around with you
In my sleepin’ R.E.M. state, U are on my mind, love
If I’m workin’, if I’m playin’, U’re with me all the time, love
Your languid body, how it moves me mysterious ways, yeah
If I’m happy or if I’m sad, it moves me every day, love

Baby, whatever U got, don’t stop it
Honey, U’re makin’ me hot and I want it
I’m in a deep blue funk but I like it
I’m addicted 2 your junk and I’m dyin’

Every day, love, at 6:30 my body gets so cool
I shiver madly, girl, I’d glady be your night time fool, love
All the honey and all the cash that this world has 2 give
Couldn’t compare 2 one strand of your hair - girl, I wanna live (with U)

Baby, whatever U got, don’t stop it
Honey, U’re makin’ me hot and I want it
I’m in a deep blue funk but I like it
I’m addicted 2 your junk and I’m dyin’, dyin’
Girl, I’m dyin’
Smooth hands, cocoa tan
Your biggest fan I am
More than any man, I can and I will until time stops
Or whatever U got discontinues

So 4 U and all that is good and true
I hereby state my allegiance
4 U and all that is true
I hereby state my allegiance {repeat phrase in loop}
Every little kiss you give to me I'll store in my memory chest
Even all the tears I shed will be there along with your warm caress
Oh darling, there's no need for me to pretend
That this love will never end, it's possible, you see
So I'll store them away in my memory chest just for me
Every letter that you write to me I'll store in my memory chest
Oh Tammi, so I can look back and read the words and I'll reminisce
I'm not sayin' that you're going to leave me
But there's one thing I do believe, it's possible, you see
Baby, I'm gonna store them away in my memory chest just for me
In my memory chest, baby, sweet sweet memories, baby
Every kiss, each caress, all your love and tenderness
In my memory chest, baby
You promised me that our love would last till the end of time
Just in case you see another girl that can change your mind
Every happy moment I spend with you I'll store in my memory chest
Oh baby, you have filled my life, my life with much love and tenderness
Oh darlin', there's no need for me to pretend
That this love will never end, it's possible, you see
So I'll store them away in my memory chest, every little thing
Baby, gonna 

[Incomprehensible] in my memory chest
Every letter, baby
Ooh, yes I will darlin'

But we'll get there, heaven knows how we will get there
We know we will

We are going, heaven knows where we are going
We'll know we're there

When somebody loves you, you feel it in your heart
When somebody loves you, you know it from the start
Every kiss becomes more than a kiss
Each look, each touch, they mean so much
And that's when you discover how it feels to be a lover

When somebody loves you, it shows every in smile
When somebody loves you, your life becomes worthwhile
Always caring, always sharing everything you do
When somebody loves you like I love you

When somebody loves you, it shows every in smile
When somebody loves you, your life becomes worthwhile
Always caring, always sharing everything you do
When somebody loves you like I love you
Well find a way regardless
To make some sense out of this mess
Well, It's a test, but I believe
A kiss is all we need
All the above for being in love
Shouldn't that alone be enough
Oh, It's tough when loves a weed
It grows inside of me
Nothings ever gonna stand in my
Nothings ever gonna stand in my
Nothings ever gonna stand in my way again
Waste the days, waste the nights
Try to downplay being uptight
Oh, you're right, but I believe
A kiss is all we need
Nothings ever gonna stand in my
Nothings ever gonna stand in my
Nothings ever gonna stand in my way again
A watch that ticks is wrapped around my wrist
(Oh no)
I'm a bomb regardless
(Oh) I'm a bomb regardless
(Oh) I'm a bomb regardless
(Oh) I'm a bomb regardless
(Oh)
Well find a way
Well find a way
Well find a way
Nothings ever gonna stand in my
Nothings ever gonna stand in my
Nothings ever gonna stand in my way again
Nothings ever gonna stand in my
Nothings ever gonna stand in my
Nothings ever gonna stand in my way again
My love don't give me presents
I know that she's no peasant
Only ever has to give me
Love forever and forever
My love don't give me presents
Turns me on when I get lonely
People tell me that she's only foolin'
I know she isn't

She don't give boys the eye
She hate to see me cry
She is happy just to hear me say
That I will never leave her
She don't give boys the eye
She will never make me jealous
Gives me all her time as well as lovin'
Don't ask me why

She's a woman who understands
She's a woman who loves her man
My love don't give me presents
I know that she's no peasant
Only ever has to give me
Love forever and forever
My love don't give me presents
Turns me on when I get lonely
People tell me that she's only foolin'
I know she isn't

She's a woman who understands
She's a woman who loves her man

My love don't give me presents
I know that she's no peasant
Only ever has to give me
Love forever and forever
My love don't give me presents
Turns me on when I get lonely
People tell me that she's only foolin'
I know she isn't

She's a woman, she's a woman...
My thoughts may stray
My eyes may roam
The neighbor's grass may seem much greener
Than the grass right here at home

If pretty girls excite me
Well, that's life
But just in case, you didn't know
I love my wife

My mind at times
May dwell on sex
If someone's rating dreams
Then most of mine I guess are double X

So dimpled knees delight me
Well, that's life
But just in case, you hadn't heard
I love my wife

Like bait that wriggles
And it makes catfish bite
A lady jiggles
And my eyes gotta light
Upon so sweet a sight
And if I shake
Break out in spots
Don't fret, it's not swine fever dear
Your swine has merely got the hots

If rosy lips invite me
Well, that's life
But just in case, you couldn't guess
I love my wife

My mind at times
May dwell on sex
If someone's rating dreams
Then most of mine I guess are double X

If rosy lips invite me
Well, that's life
But just in case, you couldn't guess
Or hadn't heard
Or didn't know
I love my wife
I love my wife
I love my wife

Mmm

Ooh ooh

Ooh ooh ahh ooh
You can do whatever you want to do
Wherever you want to go, it's up to you
And wouldn't it be fine following your heart
Playing your own part
You and me out on a farm
Let the sun be our alarm
Kicking off our shoes doing what we choose
And wouldn't it be fine
Knowing that you're mine anytime you want to be

I don't want to own you I just want to hold you
I just want to need you
I just like to see you smile and stay for awhile

If the times get rough bein' free might be enough
Keep our feelings warm see us through the storm
Wouldn't it be fine
Looking back and knowing that we helped each other find
You can do whatever you want to do
Wherever you want to go, it's up to you
And wouldn't it be fine
Following your heart playing your own part
It's up to you
It's up to you
This is my island in the sun
Where my people have toiled since time begun
I may sail on many a sea
Her shores will always be home to me

Oh, island in the sun
Willed to me by my father's hand
All my days I will sing in praise
Of your forest, waters
Your shining sand

As morning breaks
The heaven on high
I lift my heavy load to the sky
Sun comes down with a burning glow
Mingles my sweat with the earth below

Oh, island in the sun
Willed to me by my father's hand
All my days I will sing in praise
Of your forest, waters
Your shining sand
I see woman on bended knee
Cutting cane for her family
I see man at the waterside
Casting nets at the surging tide

Oh, island in the sun
Willed to me by my father's hand
All my days I will sing in praise
Of your forest, waters
Your shining sand

I hope the day will never come
That I can't awake to the sound of drum
Never let me miss carnival
With calypso songs philosophical

Oh, island in the sun
Willed to me by my father's hand
All my days I will sing in praise
Of your forest, waters
Your shining sand
When do I cry
This breakin' heart
Just hurts me more
When we're apart
And there are two of us
With our secret love

Sleep pretty baby while you wait so long
Livin' with a love that's not just make believe
Lonely nights, I see your candle glow
And in my mind, I trace
Together we can take away
The time and the space

Baby when you got a secret love
Every little touch is not enough
Every little moment we're apart is pain to me
Maybe we can find some hideaway
Everybody knows but who can say
Secretly you know I'd follow
Anywhere to make you happy
Anyway you want me I'll be standing by
I don't wanna lose the one I hunger for
Naked eyes, they watch us everywhere
Nowhere to run, I cry
Everything to lose and no alibi

Baby when you got a secret love
Nothin' you can do but rise above
Secretly you know I'd follow
Anywhere to make you happy

When do I cry
This breakin' heart
Just hurts me more
When we're apart
And there are two of us
With our secret love (together we can take away the time and the space)

Baby when you got a secret love
Nothin' you can do but rise above
Secretly you know I'd follow
Anywhere to make you happy
Drop that beat
It's the truth
You don't know what you have until you lose it

I've had all the women you could possibly imagine, in my life
I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the money, in my life
I've had my ups, my downs, I paid my dues
Learn my stride?
Love for the passion... ?

All I know is the hustle and grind
All you want is some quality time
I can't give it to you due to the life that I choose
My heart is so close to the point my blood had froze
I might wear diamonds if they really could freeze time
But then again time is money and I need mine
There I go again being selfish
And there you go again the love and helpless
You mean the world to me baby you know it's the truth
But I don't know who I love more you or the booth
These are just the things I need to get off my chest
Sometimes I feel like all I can give you is sex
I'm sorry
I've had all the women you could possibly imagine, in my life
I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the money, in my life
I've had my ups, my downs, I paid my dues
Learned my stripes
Love... ?

I ain't gone lie, baby this life is addicting
The fame, the money, ecspecially these bitches
I've been around it all, I've seen them ball
Seen them fall, go broke and lose it all
That's why I work hard, 365
24-7, baby that's my life
I bleed, I feed, I sleep, I shit this
I got a bad stomach with these haters on my shit list
I know it's hard to understand
But it's outta my hands
This is God's plan
I came, I saw, I conquered
I apoligise, but this game is a monster

I've had all the women you could possibly imagine, in my life
I've had all the cars, all the cribs, all the money, in my life
I've had my ups, my downs, I paid my dues
Learned my stripes
Love... ?
Two in love can face the world together
Hearts that cuddle up will muddle through
The world may rock and rumble
Crowds may groan and grumble
Thrones may even tumble too
Darling, two in love can face the stormy weather
Laugh aloud at every cloud above
And so we'll show them all what love can do
For you and I are two in love

[Verse 1]
Last chance lost in the tyranny of a long goodbye
Last chance lost, we talk of us with deadly earnest eyes
Last chance lost, we talk of love in terms of sacrifice
And compromise

[Chorus]
Last chance
Last chance lost

[Verse 2]
Last chance lost, the hero cannot make the change
Last chance lost, the shrew will not be tamed
Last chance lost, they bicker on the rifle range
Blame takes aim

[Chorus]
Last chance
Last chance lost

[Intro: Mike Posner]
Once I throw on this, once I throw on this, it's over, girl
Once I throw on this, once I throw on this, it's over, girl

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
I hear you knock, knock, knock, baby, come on up
I hope you got, got, got something in yo' cup
'Cause I'm three shots deep and I ain't tryna sleep
Get your Redbull on 'cause I'm ready

[Pre-Chorus]
You've been playin' hard-to-get with me all night
And we both know exactly what you want, right?
Don't tell me what you wan' do
Tell me what you gon' do
Whatchu gon' do?

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
Once I throw on this bow-chicka-wow-wow
Whatchu gonna say?
You act like you gon' leave, but I know that you gon' stay
Break it down, dicky-down-down
Girl, don't even play
Once I set the mood right, I'ma make it sound like

[Post-Chorus]
I'ma make it sound like

[Verse 2: Mike Posner]
Are you tryna make me wait, wait, wait 'til the second day?
But I can't, can't, can't even contemplate
Waiting one more minute, lemme jump in it
I brought you flowers and a teddy

[Pre-Chorus]
You've been playin' hard-to-get with me all night
And we both know exactly what you want, right?
Don't tell me what you wan' do
Tell me what you gon' do
Whatchu gon' do?

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
Once I throw on this bow-chicka-wow-wow
Whatchu gonna say?
You act like you gon' leave, but I know that you gon' stay
Break it down, dicky-down-down
Girl, don't even play
Once I set the mood right, I'ma make it sound like

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, I can make it sound like

[Bridge: Mike Posner]
Now, I ain't even gotta say shit
To make you feel alive, girl, you know you like that
Say, I ain't even gotta say shit
To make you feel alive, girl, you know you like that

[Chorus: Mike Posner]
Once I throw on this bow-chicka-wow-wow
Whatchu gonna say?
You act like you gon' leave, but I know that you gon' stay
Break it down, dicky-down-down
Girl, don't even play
Once I set the mood right, I'ma make it sound like

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, I'ma, yeah, I'ma make it

[Outro]
Once I throw on this, once I throw on this, it's over, girl
Once I throw on this, once I throw on this, it's over, girl
Once I throw on this, once I throw on this, it's over, girl...
Somebody needs me
I wish that I knew
Who she can be? worries me

Every girls that passes by I shout
Hey maybe! You've meant to be my love and babe
Somebody loves me I wonder who
Maybe it's you

[Chorus]
Won't you belive me
Somebody loves me I wonder who
I wonder who that baby can be
She's a killer, thriller

Somebody wants me I wish that I knew
Who she can be? worries me
Every girl that passes by I shout
Hey maybe, maybe it's you
You're meant to be my ever love and baby
Somebody loves me i just wonder who
Oh baby baby, maybe it's you!
Hi mom!
Hey, it’s great to be able to talk to you
Ah, I haven’t been able to talk to you in really a long time
and ah, my friend Jack has got this box that I can talk to you from
So I’d like to be able to send you this message
and tell you how much I love you and also tell you
that I think you should start talking to daddy again.
Since you’re both there together there’s no reason not to talk
And also, um, you know how we used to watch the weather all the time
on TV, and we used to know what was happening, ah, you know up there in Winnipeg
And ah, well I met this guy named Al and he’s, um, he’s the weatherman now for the whole planet
If you can imagine that, and ah, he’s uh, sometime’s not popular because, uh,
this is very strange but, you know people turn on the weatherman
When the weather is gonna be bad, they actually turn on the weatherman
and uh, say bad things about him and put him down
So, so uh, things haven’t been that great lately, uh
you know, day by day is really good, uh, you know most of the time
but every once in a while all hell breaks loose, mom
and the whole thing is just like nothing I’ve ever seen before
and it, it seems to be happening everywhere
So ah, you know if you’re in there, everywhere all the time
All around the whole globe, around earth
So you know, even though Al’s forecasts are good he gets in trouble
So ah, you know I always know we used to watch the weather forecast together
so I thought I’d tell you about that and ah, I miss you
And I know that ah, I-I know that ah, you know I’d like you to say hello to Ben for me
Ah and, tell him that you know that I’ll be around, ah, I’ll be there eventually.
Ah, not for a while though, I still have a lot of work to do here
And ah, and so I love you, and ah I hope eveybody’s feeling good up there
and don’t forget to talk to daddy, bye!
There were shadows on the sand closely mingled
Just two lovers by a moonlit sea
While I watched I thought of you and I tingled
For they kissed the way you did with me
Then the shadows on the sand came much nearer
And the moon was like a spotlight then
There was one familiar face showing clearer
It was you, I couldn't look again
I felt so sad, there you were with someone new
I felt so glad, when I found it wasn't true
For the shadows on the sand seemed to break up
And I looked around me with a start
When the pounding of my heart made me wake up
From a dream that nearly broke my heart
Writer(s): Cahn/Chaplin

This is my first affair - please be kind
Handle my heart with care - please be kind

This is all so grand
My dreams are on parade
If you'll just understand
They'll never, never fade

So tell me your love's sincere - please be kind
Tell me I needn't fear - please be kind

'Cause if you leave me dear, I know my heart - will lose its mind
If you love me - please be kind
Well I dream I heard you cry
Babe, but I heard you call my name
Well I dream I heard you cry, darling
Babe, but I heard you call my name
Well, it had to be you
Baby, to call so lonesome and plain

The other night when we were lovin'
Babe, I held you in my arms
Yes, when we were lovin', darlin'
Babe, I held you in my arms
Well, you told me that you love me
And no-one else would do me no harm

Well, you told me a lie
Babe, and you told me goodbye
Oh, you told me a lie
Darlin', and you told me goodbye
Well now, it's all your worry baby
And you have no need to cry

[Verse 1]
Hey, little babe, you're changing
Babe, are you feeling sore?
Ain't no use in pretending
You don't wanna play no more

[Verse 2]
It's plain that you ain't no baby
What would your mother say?
You're all dressed up like a lady
How come you behave this way?

[Chorus]
Sail away sweet sister
Sail across the sea
Maybe you'll find somebody
To love you half as much as me
My heart is always with you
No matter what you do
Sail away sweet sister
I'll always be in love with you

[Verse 3]
Forgive me for what I told you
My heart makes a fool of me
Ooh, you know I'll never hold you
I know that you gotta be free, yeah

[Chorus]
Sail away sweet sister
Sail across the sea
Maybe you'll find somebody
To love you half as much as me
Take it the way you want it
But when they let you down
My friend, sail away sweet sister
Back to my arms again

[Bridge]
Hot child don't you know
You're young?
You've got your whole life
Ahead of you
Ooh aah, you can throw
It away too soon
Way too soon, yeah

[Chorus]
Sail away sweet sister
Sail across the sea
Maybe you'll find somebody
Gonna love you half as much as me
My heart is always with you
No matter what you do
Sail away sweet sister
I'll always be in love with you
Did you ever think that you would be rich
Did you ever think that you would have these hits
Did you ever think that you would be the don
Have a crib with a fifty acre lawn
Did you ever think that you would be this paid
Were these times when your ass was real afraid
Did you ever think that you would sell out tours
Have a show with fifty million viewers

I used to think about how I was gonna make it
Struggling day to day trying to get this paper
Hoping the day would come when things would go my way
And now I'm lying lavish and all I do is think and say

Just try my best to answer all of those questions that I ask

I used to play the game and like the same ole same
Dreamin' 'bout city lights it was my only life
And now this world I chose as if I did not own
Now I can't go nowhere without you all wanting to know
Did you ever think that you would be rich
Did you ever think that you would have these hits
Did you ever think that you would be the don
Have a crib with a fifty acre lawn
Did you ever think that you would be this paid
Were these times when your ass was real afraid

I think of you when I hear songs we used to sing
I think of you and I remember everything
When someone that we knew brings up the things we used to do
I start to feeling lonely, and my heart breaks right in two

I see your face in every daydream that I know
Can't sleep at night because I need and miss you so
Just when I think that I'll forget and find somebody new
I get that empty feeling, and I think of you

I close my eyes and make believe you're standing near
I whisper "I love you" and make believe you hear
I tell the world that no one else will ever, ever do
It seems as if you're with me when I think of you
Long time ago in Bethlehem
So the Holy Bible say
Mary's boy child, Jesus Christ
Was born on Christmas day

Hark, now hear the angels sing
A new King born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day

While shepherds watched their flock by night
And see a bright new shining star
And hear a choir sing
The music seem to come from afar

Now Joseph and his wife Mary
Come to Bethlehem that night
And find no place to borne she child
Not a single room was in sight

Hark, now hear the angels sing
A new King born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day
By and by they find a little nook
In a stable all forlorn
And in a manger cold and dark
Mary's little boy was born

Hark, now hear the angels sing
A new King born today
And man will live forever more
Because of Christmas day
Since this recession I'm losing my baby
Because the times are getting so hard
Yes, since this recession I'm losing my baby
Because the times are getting so hard
Yes, I have to stop running around
Man, you know it's breaking my heart

Yes, I can't afford no liquor
All I can buy is beer and wine
Yes, I can't afford no liquor people
All I can buy is beer and wine
Well I can get my baby what she wants
And she stays cross al the time, yes help me

Yes, please somebody
Please go out to Washington for me
Yes, please, please somebody
Please go out to Washington for me
Yes, think about us out here
Help me get out of this misery
We come on the sloop John B
My grandfather and me
Around Nassau town we did roam
Drinking all night
Got into a fight
Well, I feel so broke up
I want to go home

So hoist up the John B's sail
See how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore
Let me go home
Let me go home
I wanna go home, yeah, yeah
Well, I feel so broke up
I wanna go home

The first mate he got drunk
And broke in the captain's trunk
The constable had to come and take him away
Sheriff John Stone
Why don't you leave me alone? Yeah, yeah
Well, I feel so broke up
I wanna go home
So hoist up the John B's sail
See how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore

The poor cook he caught the fits
And threw away all my grits
And then he took and he ate up all of my corn
Let me go home
Why don't they let me go home?
This is the worst trip
I've ever been on

So hoist up the John B's sail
See how the mainsail sets
Call for the captain ashore
Let me go home
Let me go home
I wanna go home
Let me go home

Once a jolly Swagman, camped by a Billabong
Under the shade of a Coolibah tree
And he sang as he watched and waited till his Billy boiled
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me

Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me
And he sang as he sat and waited till his Billy boiled
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me

Down came a Jumbuck to drink at that Billabong
Up jumped the Swagman and grabbed him with glee
And he sang as he shoved that Jumbuck in his tucker bag
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me

Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me
And he sang as he shoved that Jumbuck in his tucker bag
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me

Up rode the squatter mounted on his thoroughbred
Down come the troopers, one, two, three
Whose that jolly Jumbuck you've got in your tucker bag?
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me
Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me
Whose that jolly Jumbuck you've got in your tucker bag?
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me

Up jumped the Swagman, sprang into the Billabong
Drowning himself by the Coolibah tree
And his ghost may be heard as you pass by that Billabong
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me

Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me
And his ghost may be heard as you pass by that Billabong
You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me
There is a place in the heart of this city
A little sun comes shining through, yeah
For once in my life I can feel like
The sun is shining for me too

?Cause in my life
It?s never been this way before
Some thing's calling me, calling now
Yeah, it?s calling now

Did you ever think, well, love ain't right for me
Though you try and try
It's one of those things make you feel like
It's just not meant to be

?Cause in my life
I never felt this way before
But you call me, babe, call me now
Yeah, you call me now

You just call
Call me, babe, call me now
You better call me now
The other night I'm down at Slim's place
This melody comes drifting through, yeah
The thing is this song's got some blue eyes
And stands about five foot two

Now it's my life
And someone?s knocking at the door
?Cause you call me, baby, call me now
You better call me now

If you call
Call me baby, call me now
You better call me now

Call me, baby, call me, girl
Just call me, call me girl
Call me, call me now
Call me now

Call, call me, baby
Down by the lake
A warm afternoon breezes carry children's balloons
Once upon a time not long ago
She lived in a house by the grove
And she recalls the day when she left home

Long good-byes make me so sad
I have to leave right now
And though I hate to go
I know it's for the better

Long good-byes make me so sad
Forgive my leaving now
You know I'll miss you so
And days we spent together

Long in the day, moon on the rise
She sighs with a smile in her eyes
In the park it's late after all
She sits and stares at the wall
And she recalls the day when she left home
Long good-byes make me so sad
I have to leave right now
And though I hate to go
I know it's for the better

Long good-byes make me so sad
Forgive my leaving now
You know I'll miss you so
And days we spent together

[Verse 1: Melvin Franklin]
Now that it is Christmas time
And if you say you would be mine
It would be Christmas every day
And baby, I'm in love in you
And if you say you love me too
It would be Christmas every day

[Pre-Chorus: Melvin Franklin & The Temptations]
What a lovely Christmas!
Christmas in the winter time
When the snow falls on the ground
I said Christmas, Christmas in the summer time
If I had you around
Christmas in the spring time
And baby that ain't all
If I had you to say you love me too
It would be Christmas even in the fall

[Chorus: Melvin Franklin]
I wrote and told Santa Claus I needed you
Because it would Christmas every day
And I would have the Christmas spirit all through the year
It would be Christmas every day

[Bridge: The Temptations & Melvin Franklin]
Christmas every day!
Every day would be Christmas
Christmas every day!
Lady if I had you
Christmas every day!
A Christmas every day
Christmas every day!

[Chorus: Melvin Franklin]
I wrote and told Santa Claus I needed you
Because it would Christmas every day
And I would have that Christmas spirit all though the year;
It would be Christmas every day

[Outro: The Temptations & Melvin Franklin]
Christmas, Christmas in the winter time
When the snow falls on the ground
What a lovely Christmas
Christmas in the summer time
A when it's hot we'll still have fun
A lovely Christmas
Christmas in the spring time!
When the little birdies sing
You got me walking got me talking 'bout Christmas
Christmas in the fall time!
I got that Christmas spirit
Every day, every day!
Christmas every day!
Every day!
Christmas every day!
Every day, every day!
Christmas every day!

Love is forever, baby so are we
For every ship there is a shining sea
For every heart, there is a waiting heart
You are the light that lead me through the dark
Your love keeps shining like a star
When I am lost I know, your love will find me

Love is the only chain
I say, love is the only chain
Oh, love is the only

We fit together, baby we belong
The music plays, you're my only song
Here with you, I am complete
You have become the very heart of me
Your love keeps shining like a star
When I am lost I know, your love will find me

Love is the only chain
I say, love is the only chain
Oh, love is the only
Love is the only chain
Love is the only chain
I say, love is the only chain
Love is the only chain
It's Christmas in Heaven
And it's Heaven in you
And my darling, if you leave me
I don't know what I'll do

Yes, it's Heaven at Christmas
And it's Christmas all you through
It's Christmas in Heaven, and baby
It's Heaven here with you

Oh, if you kiss me

I hear angels singing...
And if we dance now
And listen too, and everything, everyting seems allright

Oh baby, it's heaven at Christmas
And it's Christmass all you through
Yes, it's Christams in Heaven
And baby, it's Heaven here with you
When you speak you speak to me
When you sleep you sleep by me
When you wake you wake with me
When you walk you follow two steps behind in life

Shadows stalking, ever grasping sinking for a need
It wasn't love it was the fix of never wanting me
Now I'm gone, you're tossing and you turning in your sleep
That's the name of the game, of the game, of the game

Cry, Miss Peculiar
You'll cry all the more, now I'm gone
I was the monkey on your back
Take a look at how lucky you are

When you speak you speak to me
When you sleep you sleep by me
When you wake you wake with me
When you walk you follow two steps behind

Cry, cry, Miss Peculiar
You'll cry all the more, now I'm gone
I was the monkey on your back
Take a look at how lucky you are
Some days are heaven, I will not deny
Probing the daylight cascading the skyline
Tripping and diving and losing it all
Back came the night time living for more

Cry, cry, Miss Peculiar
You'll cry all the more, now that I'm gone
I was the devil monkey on your back
Take a look at how lucky you are

When you speak you speak to me
When you sleep you sleep by me
When you wake you wake with me
When you walk you follow two steps behind

La La La La La

[Verse 1]
Oh, I've been thinking of you
And you've been thinking of me
Oh, I'll give all that I have
If you'll give all that I need

[Pre-Chorus]
And oh, oh, oh, let's be fair
And I think it's time we cleared the air
You've been watching me, I've been watching you
You know I've been wantin' to

[Chorus]
(Groove with you)
Girl, speak your mind
(Groove with you)
You been thinking all of this time

Oh baby, what I wouldn't do

Oh, love is all in your eyes
Love fire is burning for me
You stay all in my mind
Oh woman, it's easy to see

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, let's be fair
You know it's time we cleared the air
You've been watching me, I've been watching you
And you know, you know

[Outro]
(Groove with you)
Oh, I wanna groove, I wanna groove
(Groove with you)

I wanna groove with you

Do it all day, do it right
Keep me up all through the night
Come and take me for a ride
Getting off, we're flying high
You've got a way out love
You've got a way out love
Touch me baby, feel me right
Come with me to paradise
Got me going out my mind
You've got a way out love
You've got a way out love
Way out, way out
Way out love
Way out, way out
Way out love
Way out, way out
Way out love
Way out, way out
Give me all your sweet honey

You've got a way out love
You've got a way out love
Girl, you're way out
Way out, way out
There's no doubt about it
Way out love

[Verse 1]
The tour bus came yesterday
The driver's a mess today
It's a dump of a destiny
But it's got a view

[Verse 2]
Now the kid in the see-through blouse
She's moving in hard on his holy vows
Since the preacher's not dead
Dead drunk will have to do

[Chorus 1]
Night of the iguana
The jasmine is so mercilessly sweet
Night of the iguana
Can you hear the castanets?
The widow is dancing down on the beach

[Verse 3]
The starlight is steaming
He'd like to be dreaming
His senses are screaming
Not to be denied

[Verse 4]
But if the spell of the night should win
He could lose his bus for the same sweet sin
That took his church from him
Then how will he survive?

[Chorus 2]
Night of the iguana
The jasmine is so mercilessly sweet
Night of the iguana
Can you hear the castanets?
It's the widow and her lover boys down on the beach

[Verse 5]
Oh, the night is so fragrant
These women so flagrant
They could make him a vagrant
With the flick of a shawl

[Verse 6]
The devil's in sweet sixteen
The widow's good looking but she gets mean
He's burning like Augustine
With no help from God at all

[Outro]
Night of the iguana
It's the tracks of my, tracks of my, tracks of my tears
Tracks of my...ooh ooh...
Ooh...ooh...ooh...

[Verse 1]
People say I'm the life of the party
'Cause I tell a joke or two
Although I might be laughing out loud and hearty
Deep inside I'm blue

[Chorus]
So take a good look at my face
You'll see this smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears

I need you (need you)
Need you (need you)

[Verse 2]
Since you left me, if you see me with another girl
Seeming like I'm having fun
Although he might be cute she's just a substitute
Because you're the permanent one

[Chorus]
So take a good look at my face, uh-huh
You'll see my smile looks out of place
Look even closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears

Oh, I need you (need you)
Need you (need you)
Ooh...oh-oh

[Bridge]
(Outside) I'm masquerading
(Inside) my hope is fading
(I'm just a clown) oh yeah, since you put me down
My smile is my make-up I wear since my break-up with you

[Chorus]
So take a good look at my face
(Take a good look, baby)
Smile looks out of place
(It looks so out of place)
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears

So take a good look at my face
You'll see this smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
Oh, look at me, baby, I'm crying
Oh, my heart is slowing dying...
Last night me and my dawgs were hanging out
Tired of being cramped up in the house
We were simply celebrating life
Off from work today so it's alright
But all those ups n downs had me in a twist
Started dancing wit this model chick
And then every record became my favorite song
And that is all that I remember

'Cause I had one too many drinks
And ended up at the embassy
With this pretty little thing from Memphis, Tennessee
It was a one night extravaganza

When I woke up from last night's avoutrie
Baby girl was layin' next to me
Shoes and clothes were scattered everywhere
I got dressed and got up out of there
But not before I called for me a cab
Hung over from all the drinks I had
And now I'm telling my story to you
Everything that I remember
'Cause I had one too many drinks
And ended up at the embassy
With this pretty little thing from Memphis, Tennessee
It was a one night extravaganza
I had one too many drinks
And ended up at the embassy
With this pretty little thing from Memphis, Tennessee
It was a one night extravaganza

Extravaganza
Extravaganza
Only was an extravaganza
Yes it was the things that I remember

And I remember bein' at the bar tryin' to ask what that hypno hit fo'
Knowin' I can't afford to get mo'
Here's a broke nigga tricked by 1 buy one and six flo'
Or or leave the club now do like I did come back when you get dough
A fishstick...now we messin' wit lobster
We messin' wit Grammies we messin' wit Oscars
We messin' wit that dranky drank
Plus you puffin' on the...
In the mornin' you gon' draw a blank
The hotel say you was ours
My girl wasn't on shit I picked the wrong one
'Stead he talkin' 'bout I like them other girls
Well tonight I'm tryin' to find them other girls
Bring they own rubber girl
Meet your mother girl
You know they love it when you love em when they tell they friends girl
I had one too many drinks (I had one too many (You know they gon' blame it on the drinks))
And ended up at the embassy (you know the excuse is to do exactly what you want)
With this pretty little thing from Memphis, Tennessee (J.Foxx, Kanye to the...)
It was a one night extravaganza (And the winners are)
I had one too many drinks (thats BSP baby, we got black star power in the room right now)
And ended up at the embassy (easy, easy, be very easy)
With this pretty little thing from Memphis, Tennessee (calm down please)
It was a one night extravaganza (I ain't see the periods)
I had one too many drinks

[Verse 1]
Here they come to steal my soul (Ghost train)
Wait it out until I know (Ghost train)
Tryin' not to feel I give it (Ghost train)
Movin' up until I go, go-oh (Ghost train)

[Intro: Rudolph Isley]
Elaine, this is Rudolph out here
If you don't come out tonight

[Verse 1: Rudolph Isley]
I'm gonna knock on your door, ring on your bell
Tap on your window too
If you don't come out tonight while the moon is bright
I'm gonna knock and ring and tap until you do
I'm gonna knock on your door, call out your name
Wake up the town, you see
I'm gonna hoot and howl like the lovesick owl
Until you say you're goin' out with me

[Bridge: Rudolph Isley]
Hey little girl, this ain't no time to sleep
Let's count kisses 'stead of countin' sheep
How can I hold you near
With you up there, and me down here?

[Verse 2: Rudolph Isley]
I'm gonna knock on your door, ring at your bell
Wake up the town, you see
If you don't come out tonight while the moon is bright
I'm gonna knock and ring and tap until you do

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge: Rudolph Isley]
Hey, little girl, this ain't no time to sleep
Let's count kisses 'stead of countin' sheep
How, how can I hold you near
With you up there and me down here?

[Verse 3: Rudolph Isley]
I'm gonna knock on your door, ring on your bell
Tap on your window too
If you don't come out tonight while the moon is bright
I'm gonna knock and ring and tap until you do

[Outro: The Isley Brothers & Rudolph Isley]
(I'm gonna) I'll knock and ring and tap until you do
(Elaine, you hear me? I'm gonna)
I'll knock and ring and tap until you do
(I'm gonna keep knocking on your door)
I'll knock and ring and tap until you do
(You better come on out here, I'm gonna)
I'll knock and ring and tap until you do
(No matter what you do)
Sickened by sun, with rainstorms lashing him rotten
A looted wreath crowning his tangled hair
Every moment of his youth apart from its dream was forgotten
Gone the roof overhead, but the sky was always there

Oh you, who are flung out, alike from heaven and from Hades
You murderers who've been so bitterly repaid
Why did you part from the mothers who nursed you as babies
It was peaceful and you slept and there you stayed

Still he explores and rakes the absinthe green oceans
Though his mother has given him up for lost
Grinning and cursing with a few odd tears of contrition
Always in search of that land where life seems best

Loafing through hells and flocked through paradises
Calm and grinning, with a vanishing face
At times he still dreams of a small field he recognises
With a blue sky overhead and nothing else

[Verse 1]
So you're through with love
And you say
It's just a waste of time
(Waste of time you blew your mind)
There are two sides to love
And if you will
I'd like to show you mine
Girl, love has it's ups and downs
It's sometimes like a merry go round
Going round and around and around and around
Never knowing where you're bound
I may not be the one you want
But I'm sure the one you need
Give me a chance to prove
Love shared by me and you can be

[Chorus]
Heavenly
Heavenly
Heavenly
(That's how)
That's how love is when it's right it's right
(Simply)
Heavenly
Heavenly
Heavenly
(That's how)
That's how love is when it's right

[Verse 2]
Hey girl, be fair to your heart
Don't turn your back on love
(Don't turn your back on love)
No, no, 'cause love is the one thing everybody needs
(Everybody needs love)
Hey girl, open up your heart again
Please, won't you let me in
Give me a chance to undo, all the hurt he's put you through
I may not be the one you want
But I'm sure the one you need
Girl, give me a chance and you'll see
Sharing your love with me will be

[Chorus]
Heavenly
Heavenly
Heavenly
(That's how)
That's how love is when it's right
(I know, I know it's gonna be)
Heavenly
Heavenly
Heavenly
That's how love is when it's right

[Bridge]
Oh girl
Hey girl, give love another try
Oh, love can pass you by
Love can be

[Chorus]
Heavenly
Heavenly
Heavenly
(Hey girl)
That's how love is when it's right
Heavenly
Heavenly
Heavenly
(Hey girl)
That's how love is when it's right
(Love can be, love can be)
Heavenly
Heavenly
Heavenly
(Hey girl)
That's how love is when it's right
Heavenly
Heavenly
Heavenly
That's how love is when it's right
Writer(s): Lerner/Loewe

What a day this has been
What a rare mood I'm in
Why it's almost like being in love

There's a smile on my face
For the whole human race
Why it's almost like being in love

All the music of life seems to be
(Just) Like a bell that is ringing for me

And from the way that I feel
When the bell starts to peel
I would swear I was falling, I could swear I was falling
- It's almost like being in love
There ain't no money to buy cocaine, sugar babe
There ain't no money to buy cocaine, sugar babe
There ain't no money to buy cocaine
Burn your nose and rot your brain, sugar babe
Sugar babe

I woke up this morning blues all around, sugar babe
I woke up this morning blues all around, sugar babe
I woke up this morning blues all around
Threw on my rags and walked 'round town

Standing on a corner don't you see, sugar babe
Standing on a corner don't you see, sugar babe
Standing on a corner don't you see
They hauled me away for vagrancy, sugar babe

Leave that red whiskey alone, sugar babe
Leave that red whiskey alone, sugar babe
Gives you paulsey in your bones, sugar babe, sugar babe

Whatcha gonna do when the meat gives out, sugar babe
Whatcha gonna do when the meat gives out, sugar babe
Whatcha gonna do when the meat gives out
Standing on the corner mouth and a pout, sugar babe
Aw, sugar babe
Chattanooga is a fine old town, sugar babe
Chattanooga is a fine old town, sugar babe
Chattanooga is a fine old town
You get a little crazy then burn your house down
Sugar babe, sugar babe

I said Chattanooga is a fine old town, sugar babe
Chattanooga is a fine old town, sugar babe
Chattanooga is a fine old town
You get a little crazy then burn your house down
Sugar babe

[Verse 1: Shawn Stockman]
Your eyes are telling me
On my knees is where I should be
On your lips I can read my name
Even though you ain't said a thing
I know I've been here before
A familiar place in fact I'm sure
That I, you, something in between
That's haunting me

[Chorus]
Instantly you're on top of me
So good to see you on top of me
This is where I'm supposed to be
All up into you (All up into you, baby)
There's no place I would rather be
Livin' inside of your ebony
Lovin' you, make love to you
Love ya, oh my luv n u

[Verse 2: Wanya Morris]
Got me open and I can't explain
How in our ecstasy there's no shame
Composure we had is gone
Lust in us we can't tame
We've been here before
This familiar place, in fact I'm sure
It was a dusk, dawn, through the afternoon
I'm still in you

[Chorus]
Instantly you're on top of me
So good to see you on top of me
This is where I'm supposed to be
All up into you (All up into you)
There's no place I would rather be
Livin' inside of your ebony
Lovin' you, make love to you
Love ya, oh my, luv n u

[Bridge]
Baby, I just can't get enough
Even though you're mine
I want it all the time, yeah
Oooo
Make love to you, love ya
Lovin' you, oh my luv n u

And I'm lovin....lovin' you
Make love to you, love ya
Oh my luv n u

[Chorus]
Instantly you're on top of me
So good to see you on top of me
This is where I'm supposed to be
All up into you
There's no place I would rather be
Livin' inside of your ebony
Lovin' you, make love to you
Love ya, oh my luv n u
Instantly you're on top of me
(Don't worry, I got this)
Lovin' you, make love to you
Love ya, oh my luv n u

Instantly you're on top of me
So good to see you on top of me
This is where I'm supposed to be
All up into you
There's no place I would rather be
Livin' inside of your ebony
Lovin' you, make love to you
Love ya, oh my luv n u

Oh, don't stop yet, I'm almost there
Don't stop...
Of the darkness in men's minds, what can you say?
That wasn't marked by history or the TV news today
He gets away with murder, the blizzards come and go
The stab and glare and buckshot of the heavy heavy snow

It comes and goes
It comes and goes

His grandpa loved an empire, his sister loved a thief
And Lindsey loved the ways of darkness beyond belief
Girls in chilly blouses, the blizzards come and go
The stab and glare and buckshot of the heavy heavy snow

It comes and goes
It comes and goes

The cops don't seem to care for derelicts or ladies of the night
They're weeds for yanking out of sight
If you're smart or rich or lucky, maybe you'll beat the laws of man
But the inner laws of spirit and the outer laws of nature, no man can
No, no man can
There lives a wolf in Lindsey that raids and runs
Through the hills of Hollywood and the downtown slums
He gets away with murder, the blizzards come and go
The stab and glare and buckshot of the heavy heavy snow

It comes and goes
It comes and goes
Daddy was a Cajun, raised on Southern land
And so my kinfolks tell me, was a street-fightin' man
Well, they rushed him down to see the doctor
"Hey doctor, won't you check his head?"
The only thing that was wrong with him
Was Johnny Walker's Red
He drank ole poison whiskey
'Til it killed him dead

It happened back in the bayou many years ago
Satan came to take him and he did it real slow
Well, they rushed him back to see the doctor
The doctor just shook his head
"Twenty years of rotgut whiskey
Done killed the poor man dead."
He drank ole poison whiskey
'Til it killed him dead

Take a tip from me, people... brothers can't you see
Ain't no future in ole poison whiskey
They're gonna rush you down to see the doctor
The doctor's gonna shake his head
The only thing he's gonna tell ya
"Stop drinkin' Johnny Walker's Red
Don't drink poison whiskey, don't you drink it boy
Some enchanted evening, you may see a stranger
You may see a stranger across a crowded room
An' somehow you know, you know even then
That somewhere you'll see her again and again!
We met when she was younger
Then I had no eyes for her
A few years went by and I saw her
Now I'm gonna try for her

Look out babe

She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew

How could I ever have known that
She'd be what she is today
And look at how her boyfriend holds her
I'll be moving in one day

Split man

She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
La doo day pow pow pow
La doo day pow pow pow
La doo day pow pow pow

She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew

She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew

[Intro: Toro y Moi]
Ahhh ahhh
Ahhh ahhh
Ahhh ahhh
Ahhh ahhh
Ahhh ahhh

[Verse 1: Toro y Moi]
Oh Mr. Jackson I know
I wasn't up to par (wasn't up to par)
Do I come off like I don't care at all? (don't care at all)

Don't think I'll fall
Flat onto my hands
And let you stand tall (let you stand tall)

Becase nothing is worst
And no one is the best
No one is the best

Cause I feel like I'm dreaming
Are you gonna really make me fail?
Are you gonna really hold me back?
I don't think I like this life you love
Ooh!
Ohh!
Shh-ooh!

[Verse 2: Toro y Moi]
If I study hard
I doubt I'd learn enough
Do you think that's fine?
For me to be like this (for me to be like this)
The one that doesn't care (the one that doesn't care)
The one that gives a shit (the one that gives a shit)
That no one notices (that no one notices)

I feel right in my home
Feel the night slit my throat
Feel the night slit my throat

[Outro: Toro y Moi]
Did you have to?
Did you have to?
Oh, did you have to?
Did you have to?
Did you have to?
Did you have to?
Did you have to?
Did you have to?
I'm the kid who ran away with the circus
Now I'm watering elephants
But I sometimes lie awake in the sawdust
Dreaming I'm in a suit of light
Late at night in the empty big top I'm
All alone on the high wire
Look, he's working without a net this time
He's a real death-defier

I'm the kid who always looked out the window
Failing test in geography
But I've seen things far beyond just the schoolyard
Distant shores of exotic lands
There, the spires of the Turkish Empire
It's six months since we made landfall
Riding low with the spice of India
Through Gibraltar, we're rich men all

I'm the kid who thought we'd someday be lovers
Always held out that time would tell
But time was talking, I guess I just wasn't listening
No surprise if you know me well
And as we're walking toward the train station
There's a whispering rainfall
'Cross the boulevard you slip your hand in mine
In the distance the train calls
I'm the kid who has this habit of dreaming
Sometimes gets me in trouble too
But the truth is I could no more stop dreaming
Than I could make them all come true
Who knows how long I've loved you?
D'you know I love you still?
Will I wait a lonely lifetime?
If you want me to, I will

For if I ever saw you
I didn't catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same

Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we're together
Love you when we're apart

And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Da da da da de da dum

And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
'Cause the things you do endear you to me
Oh, you know I will
I will
Da da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da
Tell you where it’s at
Ain’t nobody crying now
‘Cept for me
Cause it always matters to me yeah

Lost your head
Life is dead
So please
Don’t come singing that sad song anymore
Cause just doesn’t matter to me

Find another fantasy
Yeah
Go on fly
Fly back to your flame

Just a game
How you play it
So please
You won’t be running that game on me no more
Cause you’re gone baby gone to me
You ain’t coming back
Cause you’re gone baby gone to me

(Organ interlude)

Right back where it’s at
Find another fantasy
As you fly
Fly back to your flame

Lost your game
No one playin’
So please
You won’t be running that game ‘round here no more
Cause you’re gone baby gone to me
(Ain’t no use)
(Ain’t no use)

You ain’t coming back
Cause you’re gone baby gone to me
(Ain’t no use)
(Ain’t no use)

You ain’t coming
Cause you’re gone baby gone
(Ain’t no use)
(Ain’t no use)
I looked in the mirror and realised
I can be the one, be the one to change the world
Even though it seems impossible, sometimes
And I'm like maybe, just maybe
Even though I'm not first place at the finish line
I still won a prize inside, I tried
Now I can't do everything, no
I'm still gonna try, gonna try my best
But I will do anything, yeah
Anything for this dream of mine, yeah
I'm gonna give myself a try
Oh Oh Oh Oh
My aim is to win
So I'm gonna rise
I promise to live
Until the day I die
I gotta give myself a try
People try to, try to bring me down
But no matter what, I'm never gonna ever change
No matter what they try to say, to me
I'm a winner, not a quitter
And that is just the way that it's always gonna be
That it's gonna be, gonna be
Now I can't do everything, no
I am still gonna try, gonna try my best
But I will do anything, yeah
Anything for this dream of mine, yeah
I'm gonna give myself a try
Oh Oh Oh Oh
My aim is to win
So I'm gonna rise
I promise to live
Until the day I die
I gotta give myself a try
Imma keep my head up to the sky
'til I make it there
Imma keep on pushing, keep on believing
Cause my time is near
I'm gonna win, I'm gonna win, Oh, Oh
I'm gonna win, I'm gonna win, Oh, Oh
I'm gonna win, I'm gonna win, Oh, Oh
I'm gonna win, win, win
Cause I gotta give myself a try
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Gotta give myself a try
My aim is to win
So I'm gonna rise
I promise to live
Til the day I die
I gotta give myself a try
I gotta give myself a try
I gotta give myself a try
Gotta win, win, win, win, win
Gotta win, win, win, win, win
I gotta give myself a try
All of my life, I've been searchin'
For someone that's lonely too
I know my darlin', I found you

I'm gonna make you happy
Oh, that's what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna do all I can for you

Whenever I'm near you, oh, I can't control my self
My heart, it beats so fast until I know

I know this love is gonna last

Now, now my searchin', my searchin' is over
Oh, and I touch myself, I touch myself everyday
Because I never thought that anyone
Could make me feel this way

You know I never thought, I never thought
I never thought that anyone
Anyone could make me feel this way
Rockets, moon shots
Spend it on the have nots
Money, we make it
Fore we see it you take it

Oh, make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
Make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
This ain't livin', This ain't livin'

Inflation no chance
To increase finance
Bills pile up sky high
Send that boy off to die

Oh, make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
Make me wanna holler
The way they do my life
This ain't livin', This ain't livin'
Hang ups, let downs
Bad breaks, set backs
Natural fact is
Oh honey that I can't pay my taxes

Oh, make me wanna holler
And throw up both my hands
Make me wanna holler
And throw up both my hands
This ain't livin', This ain't livin'

Crime is increasing
Trigger happy policing
Panic is spreading
God knows where we're heading

Oh, make me wanna holler
They don't understand
Oh, make me wanna holler
They don't understand
This ain't livin', This ain't livin'
Isolation I suffer
We've been told horrible lies
We've been betrayed, exploited and repressed
Manipulated
Well kept in isolation
A 

[?] to danger

This whole world can appear too well, don't you think?
More and more people have been kept into misery
How much more people have to take in before they react
We're left to wallow in our shit
If you rebel you're shot
My baby don't have to work
And she don't have to rob and steal
I said, my baby don't have to work
Man she don't have to rob and steal
I give her everything she needs
Because I am her drivin' wheel

Well she left me this morning
Said she'd be back soon
Yeah, she left me this morning
Said she'd be back soon
Said she'd back Friday morning
Or late Saturday afternoon

You know I wrote my baby a letter
And I don't want nobody to break the seal
Oh I wrote my baby a letter
I don't want nobody to break the seal
I am, people, I am her drivin' wheel

Now wait a minute, let me tell you 'bout my baby (yeah)
I said I want to tell you 'bout my baby (yeah)
Let me tell ya 'bout my baby
Every time she walks
She's like a leaf shakin' on a tree
Every time my baby walks
She's like a leaf shakin' on a tree
I say come here to me baby
This is where you get your steak, potatoes and tea
Do you really love your baby
Do you care
Do you really love your baby
Do you really really care
I really wanna know

Do you mean what you say
When you say that you love me, baby
Tell me now

If you're going away
Will she come back to find me playing?
Never

You're away on your love boat
Now do you love any other
Do you dare if the temptation is there?
How much do you dare?

Do you really love her?
Do you love her
Do you really love your baby
Do you love her
Now I know what it is
When you're touched by that lovely feeling
And if you're going away
If you need someone for sensual healing, all right

There comes a time when you hunger
And you hate being, being far away
What do you do when the temptation is there?
How much do you dare?

Do you really love your baby
Do you care?
Do you really love your baby
Do you love her

It's not easy to love someone
'Cause being free is a lot of fun
Do you know what you're gonna do
I've got me feeling, don't you ever lose

Do you love your baby
Do you love her

There comes a time when you hunger
And you hate being, being far away
What do you do when the temptation is there?
How much do you dare?
Do you really love your baby
Do you care?
Do you love her

Do you really love your baby
Do you really, really care?
Do you love her?

Do you love your baby
Do you love her
Do you love your baby
Do you care?
You've got a hold on me
You've got that magic hold on me
When I'm alone now, I wonder
What is this power I'm under?

You cast a spell on me
That moment heaven fell on me
You've got a hold on me
What can I do?
But always hold on to you

You cast a spell on me
That moment heaven fell on me
You've got a hold on me
What can I do?
But always hold on to you
I never put much behind no smiles
Never felt this way for more than a little while

Loving you makes more sense
Than keeping up or paying rent
Anytime.. anytime

You walked by you got my eye
You bring on the blue blue sky
Make my day blow my blues away

I'm gonna let the four winds blow
Ain't gonna worry which way they go
I'm here to stay
Na na na na na na na
Oh.. oh I'm here to stay.. alright

Never stayed long with no country dreams
Never take much from no city schemes
No I never did.. no I never did
You came along I forgot about the past
Loves gonna grow I know it's gonna last
All the time.. all the time

Like the moon comes creeping on a summer night
Sometimes things come on just right
Make my day.. blow my blues away

I'm gonna let the four winds blow
Ain't gonna worry which way they go
No I'm here to stay.. here to stay

Hmmmmm

Oh I'm here to stay.. alright

Never put much behind no smiles
Never felt this way for more than a little while

Hmmmmm

Loving you makes more sense
Well, every time that I come home nobody wants to let me be
It seems that all the friends I've got, just got to come, interrogate me
Well, I appreciate your feelings and I don't want to pass you by
But I don't ask you about your business, don't ask me about mine

Well, its true I love the money and I love my brand new car
I like drinkin' the best of whiskey and playin' in a honky tonk bar
But when I come off the road, well, I just got to have my time
'Cause I got to find a break in this action, else I'm gonna lose my mind

So, don't ask me no questions
And I won't tell you no lies
So, don't ask me about my business
And I won't tell you goodbye

That's right

Well, "What's your favorite color and do you dig the brothers"
Is drivin' me up a wall
And every time I think I can sleep, some fool has got to call
Well, don't you think that when I come home
I just want a little peace of mind
And if you want to talk about the business buddy, you just are wastin' time
So, don't ask me no questions
And I won't tell you no lies
So, don't ask me about my business
And I won't tell you goodbye

I said, don't ask no stupid questions
And I won't send you away
If you want to talk fishin'
Well, I guess that'll be okay
I'm Don Juan's reckless daughter
I came out two days on your tail
Those two bald-headed days in November
Before the first snowflakes sail

Out on the vast and subtle plains of mystery
A split-tongue spirit talks
Noble as a nickel chief
Striking up an old jukebox

And he says, "snakes along the railroad tracks"
He says, "eagles in jet trails"
He says, "coils around feathers
And talons on scales"

Gravel under the belly plates
He says, "wind in the wings"
He says, "big bird dragging its tail in the dust
Snake kite flying on a string"

I come from open prairie
Given some wisdom and a lot of jive
Last night the ghosts of my old ideas
Reran on channel five
And it howled so spooky for its eagle soul
I nearly broke down and cried
But the split-tongue spirit laughed at me
He says, "Your serpent cannot be denied"

Our serpents love the whisky bars
They love the romance of the crime
But didn't I see a neon sign
Fester on your hotel blind?

And a country road come off the wall
And swoop down at the crowd at the bar
And put me at the top of your danger list
Just for being so much like you are

You're a coward against the altitude
You're a coward against the flesh
Coward caught between yes and no
Reckless this time on the line for yes, yes, yes

Reckless brazen in the play
Of your changing traffic lights
Coward slinking down the hall
To another restless night

As we center behind the eight ball
As we rock between the sheets
As we siphon the colored language
Off the farms and the streets
Here in Good-Old-God-Save-America
The home of the brave and the free
We are all hopelessly oppressed cowards
Of some duality, of restless multiplicity (Oh say can you see)

Restless for streets and honky-tonks
Restless for home and routine
Restless for country, safety, and her
Restless for the likes of reckless me

Restless sweeps like fire and rain
Over virgin wilderness
It prowls like hookers and thieves
Through bolt-locked tenements

Behind my bolt-locked door
The eagle and the serpent are at war in me
The serpent fighting for blind desire
The eagle for clarity

What strange prizes these battles bring
These hectic joys, these weary blues
Puffed up and strutting when I think I win
Down and shaken when I think I lose

There are rivets up here in this eagle
There are box cars down there on your snake
And we are twins of spirit
No matter which route home we take or what we forsake
We're going to come up to the eyes of clarity
And we'll go down to the beads of guile
There is danger and education
In living out such a reckless lifestyle

I touched you on the central plains
It was plane to train my twin
It was just plane shadow to train shadow
But to me it was skin to skin

The spirit talks in spectrums
He talks to mother earth to father sky
Self indulgence to self denial
Man to woman, scales to feathers, you and I

Eagles in the sky, you and I
Snakes in the grass, you and I
Crawl and fly, you and I
You and I, you and I, you and I (By the dawn's early light)
And away we go (we go we go we go)
Some old born loser type of shit (shit)
On the remix tip (tip, tip)
Dr. Seuss (Seuss Seuss Suess)

The Born Loser, not because I choose to be
But because all the bad shit happens to me
I got kids, but their mothers don't want them to know me
Sisters use to like me, but now they call me homie
Use to have a family now I'm out on my own
Had to scrap with the Pitt, cause I tried to take his bone
Bitches don't like me, they don't kiss me or hug me
They call me Kill-pretty, because I'm mad ugly
I use to get pussy, but I busted off quick
Now I gets none, so I gotta beat my dick
Time are hard in the ghetto, I steal for a living
Eatin turkey flavored Now or Laters for thanksgiving
If that ain't enough, life is rough, I swear
I don't have an address so I can't get welfare
They kicked me out the shelter
Because they said I smelled a little like the living dead
And look like helter skelter
My clothes are so funky, they bad for my health
Sometimes at night my pants go to the bathroom by their self
Even when I was little nothin went my way
I got beat up, and chased home from school every day
And despite the fact I won all the spelling bees
On my report card, I didn't get F's, I got C's
But for those who choose to snooze
Since I was born with no hope, I ain't got nothin to lose...
Young man went out and made a name for himself
Young man went out and made a name for himself
Young man went out and made a name for himself

Check check check it out

Verse 2

The Born Loser, a title I was branded with
Went to Liberty Island, and got stranded with
The Statue of Liberty, but they really didn't hafta
Leave my black ass there till the day after
No time for laughter, this shit's for real
Ribs are showin through my back, cause I haven't had a meal
In about a week, you can see bones in my hands
The racoons, beat me to the garbage cans
I'm Starvin Marvin, and it shouldn't be like that
The only thing that I'm carvin, is an alley cat
But sometimes in the daytime
I daydream of a Manwich
When all I'm really eatin is an oxygen sandwich
For those that don't know
Thats 2 peices of bread slapped together
Or I'll have a rain sandwich, depending on the weather
Born loser, caught up in the game
And I ain't even got nobody to blame..
Young man went out and made a name for himself
Young man went out and made a name for himself
Young man went out and made a name for himself

The Born Loser, yeah, that use to be my m o
When I couldn't get a soul, to listen to my demo
Doors shut in my face, until I started jammin 'em
I'm behind the doors now, but I'm the one slammin 'em
I did what I had to, to get where I got
Though I'll admit, what I had to do was a lot
I still gave it a shot, and sometimes I had to shoot
Catchin vicks just to get a little loot
I thought it was cute, and didn't care who knew
Mess around get in my way and I'd bag you too
Cause I was, born to lose, straight from the beginning
Hit the dugout, because I struck out the 1st inning
Winning, was everything, thats why I had to ask
My man to front me the loot, and he said I'd be glad to
Now, who needs a major label, we got our own
I'm the divine master of the unknown
Ain't nothin changed, I'm the same as before
When opportunity knocks, I'd just answer the door
But criminal at heart, even though I don't show it
I was always a winner I just didn't know it (know it)

Young man went out and made a name for himself
Young man went out and made a name for himself
Young man went out and made a name for himself

DMX the great
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
With a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swingin' hotspot
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

They took all the trees, put them in a tree museum
And they charged the people
A dollar and a half just to see 'em
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

Hey farmer, farmer, put away the DDT now
Give me spots on my apples
But leave me the birds and the bees, please
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)
Late last night, I heard the screen door slam
And a big yellow taxi took away my old man
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

I said, don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop)

They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
Ah ha ha ha

[Verse 1: André 3000]
One for the money, yes, sir, two for the show
A couple of years ago on Headland and Delowe
Was the start of something good
Where me and my nigga rode the MARTA through the hood
Just tryna find that hook up
Now every day we looked up at the ceiling
Watching ceiling fans go 'round, tryna catch that feeling
Off instrumentals, had my pencil and plus my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia headed to Decatur
Writing rhymes, tryna find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot, knowing that we could rock
Doing the hole in the wall clubs
This shit here must stop, like "Freeze!"
We making the crowd move, but we not making no G's
And that's a no-no

[Verse 2: Big Boi]

[Check it, a one-two, a one-two dope niggas in the Cadillac
They call us, went from Player's Ball to ballers
Putting the South up on the map was like Little Rock to banging
Niggas say mothafuck that playing, they paying, we staying laying vocals
Locales done made it with them big boys up in this industry
"OutKast, yeah, them niggas, they making big noise"
Over a million sold to this day, niggas they take it lightly
'96 gon' be that year that all y'all playa haters can bite me, I'm out this bitch

[Hook]
Me and you
Your mama and your cousin too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your mama and your cousin too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Back in the day, when I was younger, hunger
Looking to fill me belly with that Rally's bullshit
Pull shit off, like it was supposed to be pulled
Full as a tick, I was stoned like them white boys
Smoking them white girls, before them blunts, got crunk, chunky asses
Passes getting thrown like Hail Mary's
And they looking like Halle Berry's
So so fine, intertwined, but we ain't sipping wine
We's just chilling, I'm the rabid villain, and I'm so high
Smoking freely, me, Lil B, Reek, Mone and Shug
And my little brother James, thangs changed in the hood
Where I live at, them rats know, "Mama I want to sing
But mama I want to trick, and mama I'm sucking dick now"
We moving on up in the world like elevators
Me and the crew, we pimps like '82, me and you like Tony Toni Tone
(Yeah, yeah) Like this, East Point and we gone

[Hook]
Me and you
Your mama and your cousin too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your mama and your cousin too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors

[Verse 4: André 3000]
Got stopped at the mall the other day
Heard a call from the other way that I just came from
Some nigga was saying something, talking 'bout smoke something "Hey man, you remember me from school?" "No not really"
But he kept smiling like a clown, facial expression looking silly
And he kept asking me, "What kinda car you drive?
I know you paid, I know y'all got beaucoup of hoes
From all them songs that y'all done made"
And I replied that I had been going through the same things that he had
True, I've got more fans than the average man
But not enough loot to last me
To the end of the week, I live by the beat
Like you live check-to-check
If it don't move your feet then I don't eat
So we like neck-to-neck
Yes, we done come a long way like them slim-ass cigarettes
From Virginia, this ain't gon' stop, so we just gon' continue

[Hook]
Me and you
Your mama and your cousin too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your mama and your cousin too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your mama and your cousin too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your mama and your cousin too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your mama and your cousin too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
Me and you
Your mama and your cousin too
Rolling down the strip on Vogues
Coming up, slamming Cadillac doors
(Like elevators but I ain’t the one that’s pushin’ the buttons)

[GUAVA JELLY]
Baby, I really, really love you now
I think you should stop your cryin';

You know that I love you, yea-eah-eah
Groovy; here I am:
Come rub it 'pon me belly
Like a guava jelly
Damsel, here I stand:
Come rub it 'pon me belly
Like-a guava jelly

Comma, comma, come back here to me

[DEWDROPS]

Mm-mm-hm
I've been searchin' the whole darn day
For a little woman of mine - mine - mine - mine
Someone a-told me I could find her here
But it seem she disappear
Said, I searched the whole darn day;
Night is drawing nigh
I t'ink I'd better go home;
Try tomorrow again

But when I reached that railroad station
I missed the last train
And then it seemed like dewdrops
Gonna fall on me;
Yes, it seem like teardrops
Gonna call on me now

I said, I'd better make up my mind
What am I gonna do
Am I gonna rest up here
Or am I gonna push on through?

My mind say, "Hey, man, ya hit the road."
Down there I missed the track - track - track;
I'm lost! Lord, I'm lost, eh!
Love is such a heavy load!

And then: for crying out loud, come back to me!
For crying out loud, hear my plea!
For crying out loud, come back to me!
Why do you treat me so bad?
Why do you treat me so bad?
Mm - mm - mm - mm - bam, bam
Bom, bom, bome, bome

[ I'M HURTING INSIDE]
When I was just a little child
'Appiness was there awhile
Then from me it slipped one day:
'Appiness, come back, I say
'Cause if you don't come - come
I go looking, yeah! -
For 'appiness
'Cause if you don't come - come
I go looking now! -
For 'appiness

Then together like school children
Then your hurt was just in vain
Lord, I'm your weary child:
'Appiness, come back. Oh, I -
'Cause if you don't come
Gonna go lookin', yeah! -
For 'appiness
And if you don't come
Gonna go lookin', yeah! -
For 'appiness
Like Jah said, I'm a-hurtin' inside;
I'm a-hurtin' inside
Isn't she lovely, isn't she wonderful?
Isn't she precious, less than one minute old
I never thought through love you'll be
Making love as lovely as she

Isn't she lovely and she's made it from love
Isn't she pretty , truly the angel best
(She's so pretty)
For I am so happy , we have been heaven blessed
(I'm so happy)
I can't believe what God has done
To you, He has given life to one

Isn't she lovely, and she's made it from love
Isn't she lovely , life and love are the same
(She's so lovely)
Life is Aida , the meaning of her name
(Aida)
Candies good have not been done
Without you she'll be the one
Oh so very lovely, isn't she pretty?
(Isn't she pretty?)
Isn't she lovely, yes, she is made from love
We want unconditional, unconditional, unconditional
We want unconditional, unconditional rebellion...

We thought you were sensational...
Would you just smile back at me?
I should care
I should go around weeping
I should care
I should go without sleeping

Strangely enough I sleep well
'Cept for a dream or two
But then I count my sheep well
Funny how sheep can lie you to sleep

So I should care
I shouldn't let it upset me
I should care
But it just doesn't get me

Maybe I won't find someone
As lovely as you
But I should care
And I do

So I should care
I shouldn't let it upset me
I should care
But it just doesn't get me
Maybe I won't find someone
As lovely as you
But I should care
And I do
Yeah, This is Ice-T
You've just been listening to the Seventh Deadly Sin
To me the Seventh Deadly Sin is hardcore rap
And I'm very proud to have been a part of that throughout the years
I'd like to send peace out to all my homeboys that kept it real
And love to all my niggas that have died out here
In this bullshit that we call the streets
You know? What can I say? Hip Hops been good to a nigga
I got mad love for the East coast, West coast, North and South
I got my niggas The Top Guns here
We gonna sign this one off like this:

My life's been a great story in the ultimate war
Should I ill or do right? Make peace or go raw?
I can't explain the true penalties of fame and the wealth
Tell me who can I trust? I can't trust myself
Got the devil got me thinking 'bout them ill moves
Every damn kid on the street, they got something to prove
Push a bullet through my heart, why not? That's a start
They could push their reps quicker, kill a well known nigga
And if you say you're going to kill me, should I blast you first?
Being black is kinda like being born with a curse
Do or Die, that's the code of the streets I didn't invent
Niggas sketch my life out with malicious intent
My skin color's got me trapped in a never ending ghetto
I move to the hills, but I can never let go
The gun shots and the homicides just don't stop
And just because I came up, I can always drop
Yo.. we come prepared for guerilla warfare
Never scared soldiers to the heart
And hose them body parts with the hardwear
You spark a dun with Bizzaro or sequel
When you catch a link on the wings of this desert eagle
Flappin, we splittin caps friend
Remember when niggas would shoot joints
Now niggas be wildin' placing hollow points
Cause in this rat race, shit be moving at a murderous pace
Mad sons got slugs to the face, OG packs kilos
Over sore losers and cilo, prepare like a scout
I hold the burner on the delo
In this age of idolatry, mad niggas worship u vanity
If Five ?? you nigga maintain humanity - insanity
Hope you see the light ­ like the prism's true colors
Only a few remain brothers, fuck the others
In this cold world ­ the war that's controlled by the trigger
Revelation or the scripture got to be that live nigga

So if niggas want to bite the sound like Tyson
Deck him in the left eye, murder sit down like ryerson
You wanna dis, don't even try son
Hey yo, Pizzone ­ I'm the prodigy you need to keep ya eyes on
Yo who the don, who plays it all night long?
50 mill strong, Handle like napalm. Word is bond
Who get it on when it's time to drop a bomb?
Sadq keep it cool and calm with the niapalm
Droppin emcee's to their knees and make them pie straight
Dust and take and serve niggas on my hot plate
So cats who got beef, we can take it to the streets
Cause shit these niggas talk to the grave with they teeth
It's time to meet your maker step into the new millennium
I analyze data like intel Pentium
So follow me, I blame sovereignty for God we bust
Top Gun, move bright, smooth as Ice, sex and dust
Ante up the goods, Top Gun Ice-T in your neck of the woods
I'm 15 blocks deep in the foreign neighborhood
Street of my styles, no smiles, trying to gun down the golden child
Still on trial for my old endeavors
Cold weather got catched trying to buck wholes in my fucking sweater
Niggas is soft like butter, leathers and felt
Time to heat it up and melt
Felt the welts from brass belt buckles to brass knuckles
Kill all the jokes and chuckles ­ let's all get together
My fam stay thick together
Trick off and lick off together
No matter the weather
Lets ease on down to the bow and to the bricks
When I start to squeeze, I won't ease off a bit
Won't be no teams up in here with no clashes
Just bunk mile sleds boot shines up in the masses

Life got no guarantees, I'm looking for the long lease
When I'm in LA, it ain't hard to find me
21st floor eating shrimp at Belonte's
Every time you see me I'm connected to a dime piece
I check your styles, although you rhyme quicker
No matter what you do, I'll always lace mine thicker
Jealousy will make a fool die quicker than liquor
Watch your back with your niggas
Cause that's right where they'll stick ya
You see me in the club jeweled up, all alone
I give love to my homies, then I bounce the fuck home
Bodyguards are something that I just don't do
Cause if I'm after you black, I'm gonna clap them too
Money makes all my homies look brand new
I don't fuck with the fakes, I make moves with the true
Ice ­ baby chopping that real, thought you knew
I might sound hard, but nigga I can die too
Cause I'm as real as you

Funky music lights my fire
Shakes my body sexified

Since we both have lots of love
Send some lovin' up above

See the love that's in my eyes

All I know is how much I love you Baby
Woo

To prove my romance

So I can love her right now father
All of my love for you to share
Take you, baby, anywhere
I want to love you right now

Hey
Funk me if you got the desire
Funk me if you got the desire

[Repeats until end]
When all my troubles just surround me
And all my problems seem to ground me
There is a thing I'm thinkin' of
Sun in my morning and my sky above
Sun in my morning and my sky above

I'm not like you , I'm not a rich man
I work and do the best that I can
There is a place I'm thinkin' of

Sun in my morning and my sky above
Sun in my morning and my sky above

I've got my women there to guide me
In all my darkness , she will guide me
She is the think I'm talkin' of
She's my sun in the morning and my sky above
Sun in my morning and my sky above
I was cutting the rug down at a place called The Jug
With a girl named Linda Lou
When in walked a man with a gun in his hand
And he was looking for you-know-who
He said, "Hey there fellow with the hair colored yellow
Whatcha tryin' to prove?
'Cause that's my woman there and I'm a man who cares
And this might be all for you"

I was scared and fearing for my life
I was shakin' like a leaf on a tree
'Cause he was lean, mean, big and bad, Lord
Pointin' that gun at me
"Oh, wait a minute, mister, I didn't even kiss her
Don't want no trouble wit' chu
And I know you don't owe me but I wish you would let me
Ask one favor from you"

"Won't you give me three steps, gimme three steps, mister
Gimme three steps towards the door?
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, mister
And you'll never see a-me no more"
For sure
Well, the crowd cleared away and I began to pray
And the water fell on the floor
And I'm telling you son, well it ain't no fun
Staring straight down a forty-four
Well, he turned and screamed at Linda Lou
And that's the break I was looking for
And you could hear me screaming a mile away
As I was headed out towards the door

"Won't you give me three steps, gimme three steps, mister
Gimme three steps towards the door?
Gimme three steps, gimme three steps, mister
And you'll never see a-me no more"
Show me the back door

[Chorus: André 3000]
A boy to raise at a young age
No help from him, but she's alive
To be made strong, but all alone
Must be a pain, but she's alive

[Verse: André 3000]
The year was 1975
That night crickets cried
They knew what was goin' down
Three girls travel a long country road
And one said she thinks it's time
This baby wants to come right now

[Chorus: André 3000]
A boy to raise at a young age
No help from him, but she's alive
To be made strong, but all alone
Must be a pain, but she's alive

[Interlude: Woman talking]
I was scufflin' going to school, I was scufflin' working at night
And you know what? I truly believe
And that's why I tell a lot of parents, single parents
Don't tell me what God can't do
I made sure you had
I never felt like you should be deprived of anything
If a man didn't want to take care of his child, you move on
And that's what I did, I moved on

[Chorus: André 3000]
A boy to raise at a young age
No help from him, but she's alive
To be made strong, but all alone
Must be a pain, but she's alive
A boy to raise at, at a young age
No help from him, but she's alive

[Interlude: Woman talking]
He always wanted to be a father but he never took care of you
He ain't have no money, he ain't have nothin'
How can you care about somebody
And you never give the welfare of them?

[Chorus: André 3000]
A boy to raise at a young age
No help from him, but she's alive
To be made strong, but all alone
Must be a drag, but she's alive
A boy to raise at a young age
No love from him, but she's alive
To be made strong, but all alone
Must

[Interlude: Woman talking]
And I knew I had to go that road by myself

[Outro: André 3000]
She's alive
Oh so long for this night I prayed
That a star would guide you my way
To share with me this special day
Well a ribbon's in the sky for our love

If allowed, may I touch your hand?
And if pleased, may I once again?
So that you too will understand
There's a ribbon in the sky for our love

[Harmonizing]

This is not, this is not a coincidence
And far more than a lucky chance
But what it is that was always meant
Is our ribbon in the sky for our love, love

We can't lose with God on our side
We'll find strength in each tear we cry
From now on it will be you and I
And our ribbon in the sky
Ribbon in the sky
There's a ribbon in the sky for our love

[Verse 1]
Rock on, gold dust woman
Take your silver spoon, dig your grave
Heartless challenge
Pick your path, and I'll pray
Wake up in the morning
See your sunrise, loves to go down
Lousy lovers pick their prey
But they never cry out loud, cry out

[Chorus]
Well, did she make you cry?
Make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love?
And is it over now?
Do you know how?
Pick up the pieces and go home

[Verse 2]
Rock on, ancient queen
Follow those who pale in your shadow
Rulers make bad lovers
You better put your kingdom up for sale, up for sale

[Chorus]
Well, did she make you cry?
Make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love?
And is it over now?
Do you know how?
Pick up the pieces and go home
Well, did she make you cry?
Make you break down?
Shatter your illusions of love?
Now tell me, is it over now?
Do you know how
To pick up the pieces and go home, go home, go home

[Outro]
Pale shadow of a woman
Black widow
Pale shadow of a dragon
Dust woman
Mm, pale shadow of a woman
Mm, black widow
Mm, pale shadow, she's a dragon
Dust woman, woman, woman
Who needs the noise of a party crowd
Who needs the records turned up loud
When two, we two can have a party all alone?
Oh yeah

Ooo pretty music, a cozy chair
Lights down low and I'm holding you near
Oh baby, we two can have a party all alone
Oh yeah

When we are together, I'm like a feather
Floating in the air
I don't care where we're going
Just as long as you are there
Oh baby
Me and you, you and me
We can have a party, just wait and see
Oh well, two, we two can have a party all alone
Yes we can

Baby, two, we two can have a party all alone
Nobody else, you and me, hah, all alone
Pretty, pretty music, a cozy chair, yeah
What can you say? There isn't much to tell
I'm going down hill and i blame myself I've been
Jumping at Shadows
Thinking about my life

Everybody points their hand at me
I know I'm just a picture
Of what I should have been I've been
Jumping at Shadows Just thinking
About my life

God have mercy I think I'm going insane
The Devil's been gettin' at me
He's got me down again Got me
Jumping at Shadows Just thinking
About my life
Hey girl, is he everything you wanted in a man?
You know I gave you the world
You had me in the palm of your hand
So why your love went away
I just can't seem to understand
Thought it was me and you babe
Me and you until the end
But I guess I was wrong
Don't want to think about it
Don't want to talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way
Just so confused about it
Feeling the blues about it
I just can't do without ya
Tell me is this fair?
Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around
That you were gonna make me cry
It's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
That's okay baby 'cause in time you will find
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
Now girl, I remember everything that you claimed
You said that you were moving on now
And maybe I should do the same
Funny thing about that is
I was ready to give you my name
Thought it was me and you, babe
And now, it's all just a shame
And I guess I was wrong
Don't want to think about it
Don't want to talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way
Just so confused about it
Feeling the blues about it
I just can't do without ya
Can you tell me is this fair?
Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around
(Should've known better that you were gonna make me cry)
That you were going to make me cry
Now it's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
That's okay baby 'cause in time you will find
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around

What goes around comes around

What goes around comes around

What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around

What goes around, goes around, goes around

Well, if we live, we gotta grow old baby
And I know just how you're going to be
Well, your feet are already a little chilly baby
And you're gettin' a little cold to me

Well, you're gonna have a sweet and silly temper, baby
Baby, and you're not gonna speak to me for days at a time
Oh, I know you're gonna have a sweet and silly temper, baby
Baby, and you won't speak to me for days at a time
Oh baby, I know you're gettin' old
And your little temper B. won't really mind

Oh, we'll be sittin' close together baby

And our minds are really in tune
Oh, we'll be sittin' close together baby
And our minds are really in tune
Well, we'll start makin' love together, baby
Thinkin' about how we used to when we was really in bloom

Oh, I know you're gonna live like a king and queen
Baby you won't mind a word I say
I know you're gonna live like a king and queen
Baby you won't mind a word I say
Yeah, we're gonna live and get old together, baby
Yeah, 'till we old and grey
When you're awake the things you think
Come from the dream you dream
Thought has wings, and lots of things
Are seldom what they seem

Sometimes you think you've lived before
All that you live today
Things you do come back to you
As though they knew the way

Oh the tricks your mind can play

It seems we stood and talked like this, before
We looked at each other in the same way then
But I can't remember where or when

The clothes you are wearing are the clothes you wore
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then
But I can't remember where or when

Some things that happened for the first time
Seem to be happening again
And so it seems that we have met before
And laughed before, and loved before
But who knows where or when
You will like the folks you meet in our town
The folks you meet on any street in our town
Pick out any cottage, white or brown
They're all so appealing with that lived in feeling

You will like the shady lanes in our town
The music of the passing trains in our town

You will lose your heart, I promise you
In this, our two-by-four town
"Welcome" on the door town
If you'll make it your town too

You will lose your heart, I promise you
In this, our two-by-four town
"Welcome" on the door town
If you'll make it your town too
Fantastic explosion of time, you slither over the light and you fade away
Into a splendid design when we have any moment we move every way

I don't wanna explode in time
I don't wanna explode in time

Fantastic explosion of time, you slither over the light and you fade away
Into a splendid design when we have any moment we move every way
Heading colossus of ice, we're riding the highways, we're going to watch
Bumping the ether is hard when you got so different little types of touch

I don't wanna explode in time
I don't wanna explode in time

Fantastic explosion of time, you slither over the light and you fade away
Into a splendid design when we have any moment we move every way
Heading colossus of ice, we're riding the highways, we're going to watch
Bumping the ether is hard when you got so different little types of touch

Fantastic explosion of time, you slither over the light and you fade away
Into a splendid design when we have any moment we move every way
Oh yeah, hey, hey
(Jules Shear)

I've been so far away from you while standing by your side
There were nights we were so in love, that lovin' made us blind
But that time is so far below us now, the memory's so thin
It's So Easy To Begin, but it's so hard to stop, this love
It's just so hard to stop
When a heart that's lookin' for lovin' leads you in
It's So Easy To Begin
I know I've saved some lessons from the time I fell apart
And I know you've been wondering why I look at you so hard
It's 'cause I never want to wake up some day and wonder where we've been
It's So Easy To Begin, but it's so hard to stop, this love
It's just so hard to stop
When a heart that's lookin' for lovin' leads you in
It's So Easy To Begin
It's So Easy To Begin
It's So Easy To Begin
(When he reached down his hand for me)
Once my soul was astray from the heavenly way I was wretched and vile as could be
But my Saviour in love gave me peace from above
When he reached down his hand for me
When he reached down his hand for me when he reached way down for me
I was lost and undone without my God or his son
When he reached down his hand for me

I was near to despair when he came to me there
And he showed me that I could be free
Then he lifted my feet gave me gladness complete
When he reached down his hand for me
When he reached down...

[Chorus]
Do me wrong, do me right, do me right, baby
Tell me lies but hold, hold me tight
And save your goodbyes 'til the morning light
But don't let me be lonely tonight

[Verse 1]
Say goodbye, woman, say hello, hello, hello
Sure enough good to see you, oh, but it's time to go
Don't say yes, but please, don't say no
I don't wanna be lonely tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Go away then damn you
Go and do as you please, go and do as you please, girl
You ain't gonna see me gettin' down on my knees
'Cause I'm undecided and your heart's been divided
You've been turnin' my world upside down, oh babe

[Chorus]
Do me wrong, do me right, right now, baby
Go on and tell me lies but hold me tight
Save your goodbyes for the morning light
But don't let me be lonely tonight

[Outro]
Save your goodbyes for the morning light
Lord, I don't wanna be lonely tonight, no, no, no, no
I don't wanna be lonely tonight, no
I don't wanna be lonely tonight, no, no, no, no
Don't let me be lonely tonight
Don't do it, baby
I don't wanna be lonely tonight, no, no, no, no
I don't wanna be lonely tonight
If heartaches brought fame
In love's crazy game
I'd be a legend in my time
If they gave gold statuettes
For tears and regrets
I'd be a legend in my time

But they don't give awards
And there's no praise or fame
For a heart that's been broken
Over love that's in vain
If loneliness meant world acclaim
Then everyone would know my name
I'd be a legend in my time

But they don't give awards
And there's no praise or fame
For a heart that's been broken
Over love that's in vain
If loneliness meant world acclaim
Then everyone would know my name
I'd be a legend in my time
I'd be a legend in my time

[Intro: Big Pun]
Uh, no doubt, Brooklyn Funk, Ysae
Terror Squad, worldwide, no doubt
You got the Big Pun, Boricua number one
Yo, the Big Pun, Boricua number one
You got the Big Pun, Boricua number one
Yo, Mary J., let me get some

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
I just don't understand
What is your master plan?
What would you have me do?
Confusion in my mind
Been hurt a thousand times
Now I know you're not true
(That's why I can't be with you)

[Pre-Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Do you know what it meant to me
Just to make you happy?
All this time I've waited
Now our love has faded
Please tell me why it's gone
So my life can go on

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Round and round I go
Where I stop, you will never know
(You will never know that I’m going ‘round)
Round and round I go
Where I stop, you will never know

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
I told you once before
I'm walking out the door
I'm leaving you behind
Thinking ‘bout you all the time
Makes me so sad and blue
Now what are we gonna do?
(That's why I can't be with you)

[Pre-Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
You don't know what you did to me
When you told me you loved me
Now you're actin' shady
Now I'm going crazy
Please stop holding back from me
‘Cause I got to keep from going ‘round

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Round and round I go
Where I stop, you will never know
(Where I stop, you will never know, I’m going ‘round)
Round and round I go
(Gotta keep from going ‘round)
Where I stop, you will never know

[Verse 3: Big Pun]
Ave Maria, Mary—how you gonna think of leaving your daddy?
We should be married, mami—why you always beefin’ at me?
We was happy before when we was poor
Now you platinum for your Latin amor still working at the mall
Maybe you deserve better
Saying I ain’t a herb…but you need someone more conservative
That’s only right since you were down to lust
Your body’s fine as (fuck), we intertwine with lust every time we crush
Defied you once on one occasion, you don’t need another reason to jet
But I regret that I wasn’t patient
You’re everything in my world; my queen and girl
The only woman I’d consider dropping my seed in for real
We shouldn’t kill something to hard to build
Our love was strong as steel, until I sent your heart to hell
Just call my cell if you’re feeling down or low
Until then, round and round I go

So don’t leave me—no te vayas, chula
Don’t leave me—you know I do it to ya
Don’t leave me—Big Pun, mami
Don’t leave me—Ave Maria, Mary
Said don’t leave me—no te vayas, chula
Don’t leave me—you know I do it to ya
Don’t leave me—Big Pun, mami
Don’t leave me—Ave Maria, Mary

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Round and round I go
Where I stop, you will never know
(360 degrees, I’m going around)
Round and round I go
Where I stop, you will never know

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
You promised me you'd never leave
You said you'd stay with me always (Always)
Oh, you'd never leave

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Round and round I go
Where I stop, you will never know
Round and round I go
Where I stop, you will never know
I know how it feels to be head over heels
To be lost in true love and the light of the moon
When everything seems to be coming up roses
Every word seems to be rhyming with June
And suddenly, all of your dreams have come true
Happiness lives in your heart
Then out of nowhere, one becomes two
And everything seems to be falling apart
(Is it love?)
When your heart, feels like it's broken
(Is it love?)
And you just can't take anymore
(Is it love?)
When there's nothing left to be spoken
(Is it love?)
And there's nothing worth listening for
(Is it love?)
Ooh, yeah
I know what it means to get caught up in dreams
And in prayers that are answered with each passing day
When loving and laughter are birds of a feather
And sharing and caring just one simple way
You know, you'll never be all alone
That someone will always be near
Then you turn around and your best friend is gone
Oh, where do they go when they just disappear?
(Is it love?)
When your heart, feels like it's broken
(Is it love?)
And you just can't take anymore
(Is it love?)
When there's nothing left to be spoken
(Is it love?)
And there's nothing worth listening for
(Is it love?)
Ooh
There's no answer, there seems to be nothing to say
In your anger would you even hear anyway
It was magic but somehow you've broken the spell
It was heaven but somehow it's turned into hell
(Is it love?)
When you know that your heart has been broken
(Is it love?)
And you just can't take it anymore
(Is it love?)
When you feel more than you could imagine
(Is it love?)
Now there's nothing that's worth living for
(Is it love?)
Ooh, is it love? Oh, oh
(Is it love?)
Another expression of love
(Is it love?)
You could be falling in love
(Is it love?)
I wanna be in love, oh, oh, ooh
I've got a sweet little angel
I love the way she spread her wings
Yes got a sweet little angel
I love the way she spread her wings
Yes, when she spreads her wings around me
I get joy, and everything

You know I asked my baby for a nickel
And she gave me a $20 bill
Oh yes, I asked my baby for a nickel
And she gave me a $20 bill
Whoah, you know I ask her to buy a little drink of liquor
And she gave me a whiskey still

Oh, if my baby should quit me
I believe I would die
Oh if my baby should quit me
Lord I do believe I would die
Yes if you don't love me little angel
Please tell me the reason why
It's my own fault, baby
Treat me the way you wanna do

It's my own fault, baby
Treat me the way you wanna do
Yes when you were loving me, baby (woman)
At that time, little girl, I didn't love you

She used to make her own pay checks
And bring them all home to me
I would go out on the hillside, you know
And make every woman look I see

It's my own fault, baby
Treat me the way you wanna do
Yes when you were loving me, baby (woman)
At that time, little girl, I didn't love you

She said she was gonna leave me
She'd been running around with the boys
She said she was gonna leave me
Gonna be over in Illinois
It's my own fault, baby
Treat me the way you wanna do
Yes when you were loving me, baby (woman)
At that time, little girl, I didn't love you

[beat fades]
Where she leads me I do not know
Well, she leads me where she goes
I can't find her nowhere
Well, she needs me here
All aware I can't hear her walk
I just cannot hear her talk
Though sometimes, you know you will
And when she comes my way
I'll just be left any night or day
I will hear her say
That I don't wanna try
I tried, also cried
But I can't leave her behind
Come to me baby, I got something to say
I been changin' your direction ev'ry step of the way
Now I bring emotion and I bring desire
And I bring the potion to set you on fire
I know you need me, there can be no doubt
You got me held inside your love and I can't get out
We must surrender to the powers that be
The angel in you and the devil in me

Warm ride, warm ride, baby just the way you are
Warm ride, warm ride, we can reach the highest star

Now I warn you women, we are two of a kind
And we both know what's coming
We got one thing in mind
I bring the pleasure, satisfaction you learn
And I got the strength to make you burn, baby, burn

Warm ride, warm ride, baby just the way you are
Warm ride, warm ride, we can reach the highest star
Why are we waiting for this love on the rise
And why am I searching for the magic that's in your eyes
We must surrender to the powers that be
The angel in you and the devil in me

Warm ride, warm ride, baby just the way you are
Warm ride, warm ride, we can reach the highest star

Warm ride, warm ride, baby just the way you are
Warm ride, warm ride, we can reach the highest star

Warm ride
Like a cloud his fingers explode
On the typewriter ribbon, the shadow grows
His heart's in a bowl behind the bank

And every evening when he gets home
To make his supper and eat it alone
His black shirt cries while his shoes get cold

Tried and true, that's you
Tried and true

I guess I'm lucky to have you here
In that kitchen, in your chair
Sometimes I forget that you're even there

One summer, a suicide
Another autumn, a travelers guide
He hits snooze twice before he dies

And every evening when he get home
To make his supper and eat it alone
His black shirt cries while his shoes get cold
Tried and true, that's you
Tried and true
Tried and true, that's you
Tried and true
Step inside love and stay
Step inside love
Step inside love
Step inside love

I want you to stay
You look tired, love
Let me turn down the light
Come in out of the cold

Rest your head on my shoulder
And kiss me tonight
We are together now
And forever, come my way

Step inside love and stay
Step inside love
Step inside love
Step inside love
I want you to stay

And the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave
To the night and the empty skies my love
To the night and the empty skies
The first time ever I kissed your mouth

I felt the earth turn in my hand
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird
That was there at my command my love
That was there at my command
The first time ever I lay with you
And felt your heart beat close to mine

I thought our joy would fill the earth
And would last 'till the end of time my love
And would last 'till the end of time

You'll know when it happens, you won't have to guess
All at once you'll find your heart is filled with happiness
You'll know when it happens, love can't be disguised
All at once the dreams you dreamed will all be realized
Your eyes will see things that are not really there
Your lips will say things, things you never would dare
You'll know when it happens, suddenly you'll say
"Darling, I'm in love with you," it happens just that way

Your eyes will see things that are not really there
Your lips will say things, things you never would dare
You'll know when it happens, suddenly you
