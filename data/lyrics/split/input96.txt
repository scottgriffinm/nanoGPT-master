A smooth three-sided copper be my way
Twelve times a vigorous yes need I obey

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Have you ever been punched in your motherfuckin' face?
What you say? Oh, you haven't? Alright, wait, bitch

[Verse 1: Baby Keem]

Don't talk to me when I stump in this bitch
Ho, ho, pussy watery, I duck the tuna fish, ho, ho, yeah
Uh, these niggas actin' like groupie, huh
Lil' bitch, she wanna get mad 'cause I keep on lookin' all in her booby, huh

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I can't please everybody, not even me
I wanna please God, but my issues too deep
Bless up, gotta change my number every week
Enemigo, I got 'em hot, I got 'em greased
Shut the fuck up, can't you see my daughter sleep?
Shut the fuck up

[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar]
Servin' up a look, dancin' in the drought
"Hello" to the rain man, never losin' count
Ventin' in the safe house
Ventin' in the safe house

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Can I vent all of my truth? I got nothin' to lose
I got problems in pools, I can swim in my faith
Cameras movin', whenever I'm movin'
The family suin' whatever I make
Murder his stackin', the president actin'
The government taxin' my funds in the bank
Homies attracting the feds when I'm brackin'
Look at my reaction, my pupils on skates (Woah, woah)
Everything jaded (Jaded)
Team on "Go", let's get it (Get it)
Green gon' grow like veggie (Veggie)
Casino on my debit (Debit)
Fuck your rhetoric, fuck your leverage
Chain no evidence, pass go, motherfuck Confederate
Flags on the back of the medicine
Distributed and peddled in ghettos and
Fuck your heritage, fuck your brainwash detergent
Internet urgent, time travel in purges, every man and virgin
Fuck chatterin' sermons
Fuck your church propaganda, only God know the answer
We oblige in a copacetic manner
Camouflage like a sheep, so we slide through the cancer
Lies and deceit, vibe like a Phantom
Dodgin' police and paramedic retreats
Wanna fuck y'all up for tellin' me "Your life was the one I want"
Been sellin' me concepts ever since I swung
From out of the pro tongue, dedicated myself for recreation
I rest my case, won

[Refrain: Kendrick Lamar]
Servin' up a look, dancin' in the drought
"Hello" to the rain man, never losin' count
Ventin' in the safe house
Ventin' in the safe house
Servin' up a look, dancin' in the drought
"Hello" to the rain man, never losin' count
Ventin' in the safe house
Ventin' in the safe house
Lyrics from Snippets

[Part I]

[Intro]
I can’t help but feel offended
Changin' up my schedule every time you leave the session
Fuckin' on somethin'…

[Verse]
Hol' up, rockstar on…
Trademarkin' that pussy, trademarkin' my new-new bitch, yeah

[Part II]

[Intro]
You could only have love
Ooh, could I say it more?
Could I say it more?
Ayy, yeah, huh
Ayy (Melodic blue), yeah, huh
Ayy, huh, yeah, ayy

[Verse]
I was in a three 38 had to drive through southside, lose the stacks, huh
I was in a big projects, tryna buy a lil' meal, I don't know anyway, huh
I was in the cut with a gun, yeah, going, "Yeah," shawty gon' sit on my legs, huh
I was right in there, airing out the lanes of thе street, gonna pop champagne in the Cadillac, huh
I was in the drivеr seat, driver seat, driver seat, drive and get out the way, huh
I don't even know, 

[?] I need money then they know I need to get me out the frame

[Chorus]
Two things 'bout the geez, you better listen up
Chrome spokes with the spinners on his tire hubs
Suck smoke in his '40, windows up
He rolls, like he really doesn't give a-
Two things 'bout the geez, you better listen up
Chrome spokes with the spinners on his tire hubs
Suck smoke in his '40, windows up
He rolls, like he really doesn't give a-

[Verse 1]
Ayy, what is everybody talkin' 'bout?
When they wanna live fast, but I'd rather walk it out
Niggas wanna talk about a G
But I spent a G on the twelve teeth in my mouth
Diamonds aquatic, it feel like a trout on my wrist (Wrist)
Or a spout on my wrist with a spider up in it (In it)
Everything gotta be eighty and you keep the twenty percentage
You know that I get it, I'm on it, I'm in it
If you try to take it, the clip get extended
I'm back on my bullshit, like Jordan on Pippen
If this is my life then I'm Tokyo drifting (Uh)

[Chorus]
Two things 'bout the geez, you better listen up
Chrome spokes with the spinners on his tire hubs
Suck smoke in his '40, windows up
He rolls, like he really doesn't give a-

[Bridge]
Drug lust and two packets in your pocket
Disco dust hits your nose like a rocket
Wavey Davey's on fire
You still got it, you still got it al—
Wavey Davey's on fire
You still got it, you still got it al—

[Verse 2]
Maybe I do, but I still feel like I’m caged in a zoo
Inside red but the outside blue
Mama said don't check your rear view
Son, who gone hold ya
Soul when it’s over (No one)
Lord I know, lost control
Drove to fast up them old dirt roads
Heart beat slow
Fuck it put the pedal to the floor
I'm Tokyo drifting

[Chorus]
Two things 'bout the geez, you better listen up
Chrome spokes with the spinners on his tire hubs
Suck smoke in his '40, windows up
He rolls, like he really doesn't give a-

[Verse 1]
Well, she slid down the hall in her socks and yelled, "Come outside"
No, no, no, nothing's wrong
I just happen to have a surprise
So we fell through the door like the autumn leaves
And I wrestled my brother down to his knees
Just to watch as her rocket shot into the October sky

[Chorus]
There's a picture of us
In a layer of dust
On the mantle
Right by my cigarettes that I smoke since you left
'Cause you said you had to fly
In your October sky
La-la-la, la-da-da-da

[Verse 2]
Now I work in the city and I blend into the crowd
And the people grieve with me since the towers came down
You could cut the pollution with a butter knife
You could wake up at two and then party all night
But I'm missin' my mama, so I stand on the street and get high

[Chorus]
There's a picture of us
Hidden in a layer of dust
On the mantle
Right by my cigarettes that I smoke since you left
'Cause you said you had to fly
In your October sky
La-la-la, la-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

[Bridge]
And as I go back home to Memphis
I remember days that I
I was outside shootin' rockets
Almost as high, high
In your October
In your October

[Outro]
Suddenly seems like we've been here before
I never really cared until I met you
'Till now I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
'Till now I always got by on my own (Ooh whoa)
'Till now I always got by
In your October sky
La-la-la, la-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Always seemed so hard
I try to pay attention
When they speak to me

Find myself in between
A state of abdication
What they want from me

Times what they want from me
Saying something pleasing
And appealing been up to me

Exhausting conversations
Exhausting conversations

Always seemed so hard
I try to pay attention
When they speak to me

Full of tasteless abaits (?)
And chatter of defences (?)
Shutting down all my senses
Smokes out stroking the lungs (?)
Where men aboard are jackpoints (?)
Exhausting conversation

Exhausting conversation
Exhausting convеrsation
Exhausting conversation
Exhausting conversation

My place
At homе
My place
At home

Exhausting conversation

My place
At home
My place
At home

Start stay conversation

[Part I]

[Verse 1: Baby Keem]
It's a lot of hoes in here, lot of lost souls
Whole group of dime bitches and they in Vogue
Tryna find me a bitch that no one knows
I’m tryna find me a bitch that no one knows
You see that bitch right there, she fucked OVO
You see that bitch right there, she fucked Romeo
Tryna find me a bitch that no one knows
I'm tryna find me a bitch that no one knows

[Refrain: Baby Keem]
Jumpin' out the coupe
Pullin’ out smooth
I'm not afraid to lose
I'll put you on the news
Titties on the FaceTime, let 'em out
Block him, erase him, let me know
Shawty hop in that Bentayga, it's time to go
Whеn I put you in the latest, make surе he know

[Verse 2: Baby Keem]
I'm quick to book a flight, I'm not new to the game
That pussy gettin' tame, go public on the lames
I bought it, say that name, Alexander McQ-Q-Q-Queen
Rolex, woah, heart on froze
Ten white toes
It’s hot out here, I’ve hit my lows
Your leverage in the back
Your best friend was trash, trash, trash
Get gone like The Flash, Flash, Flash
Let's add and subtract, math
I see that you look at these VV-VVs
Let’s get you a piece for me

[Chorus: Baby Keem & Brent Faiyaz]
I know that you kiss and tell
Who's someone that we can tell?
You need a real nigga in your life
I come in like a thief in the night
Two phones, I'm the stereotype
Mama know me, I'm picky who I like
There’s not a fake bitch in sight
Come in like a thief in the night
(Hold up, where my phone?)

[Verse 3: Brent Faiyaz]
Sixteen missed calls
Sorry, I was busy, but I missed you (Miss me when I'm coming home)
If you see me ballin' then my bitch ball
All my niggas ballin' like I'm Rich Paul
Skrrt off in the Audi (Whip), I'ma lift off (Whip, whip)
All your bitches do pilates when you're rich, dawg
So if she can't pop a squat, then that's a rip-off
Keep the CDG, y'all niggas ripped off (Oh)
And your nigga better not think that he the only one (Ooh, ooh, only one)
That nigga match his fitted with some Jordan 1s (Yeah, yeah)
If it ain't Issey, then miss me
NUWO with Hublots
Bad bitch with Chrome toes
And we shoot movies, not photos
She not in it for the fame
Nobody know her name

[Refrain: Baby Keem]
Jumpin' out the coupe
Pullin' out smooth
I'm not afraid to lose
I'll put you on the news
Titties on the FaceTime, let 'em out
Block him, erase him, let me know
Shawty hop in that Bentayga, it's time to go
When I put you in the latest, make sure he know

[Part II]

[Intro: Che Ecru]
Alright, babe, ooh, alright, babe
Yeah, I know it's hard, babe
But I'm still on your side, babe
Alright, babe, alright, babe
I know it's hard, babe
Stay by your side babe

[Verse: Baby Keem]
Alright, babe, ooh, alright, babe
Please show me a sign, babe, wish I had more time, babe
Alright, babe, alright, babe
Busy all the time, babe, too late to reply, babe
Put me to the test, we young but we pay bills
Please don't make a mess, I don't do good with spills
Lately, I been stressed (Been deep in a drill)
No regrets when it's real

[Outro: Che Ecru & Baby Keem]
Alright, babe, ooh, alright, babe
Yeah, I know it's hard, babe
But I'm still on your side, babe
Alright, babe, alright, babe
I know it's hard, babe
It's alright
I spend most of my days with fleeting thoughts. Writing. Listening. And collecting old Beach cruisers. The morning rides keep me on a hill of silence.

I go months without a phone.

Love, loss, and grief have disturbed my comfort zone, but the glimmers of God speak through my music and family.

While the world around me evolves, I reflect on what matters the most. The life in which my words will land next.

As I produce my final TDE album, I feel joy to have been a part of such a cultural imprint after 17 years. The Struggles. The Success. And most importantly, the Brotherhood. May the Most High continuе to use Top Dawg as a vessel for candid crеators. As I continue to pursue my life's calling.

There's beauty in completion. And always faith in the unknown.

Thank you for keeping me in your thoughts. I've prayed for you all.

See you soon enough.

[Intro]
Ooh, oh

[Verse 1]
She grabs the yellow bottle
She likes the way it hits her lips
She gets to the bottom
It sends her on a trip so right
She might be goin' home with me tonight
And she looks like a model
Except she's got a little more ass
Don't even bother
Unless you've got that thing she likes
Ooh, I hope she's goin' home with me tonight
Hey!

[Chorus]
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her, I had to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned, man, I swear
She's bad and she knows, I think that she knows, uh

[Verse 2]
She shuts the room down
The way she walks and causes a fuss
The baddest in town
She's flawless like some uncut ice
Well, I hope she's goin' home with me tonight, oh
And all she wants is to dance
That's why you'll find her on the floor
But you don't have a chance
Unless you move the way that she likes
That's why she's goin' home with me tonight, oh
Hey!

[Chorus 2]
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her, I had to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned, man, I swear
She's bad and she knows, I think that she knows, uh
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
(Those flashing lights come from everywhere)
The way they hit her, I had to stop and stare (Stop and stare)
I'm love stoned from everywhere and she knows
I think that she knows
Think that she knows, oh, oh
And now I walk around without a care (Without a care)
She's got me hooked, it just ain't fair, but I
I'm love stoned and I could swear that she knows
I think that she knows, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Hey
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit her, I had to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned, man, I swear
She's bad and she knows, I think that she knows, uh
Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare (Cause a glare)
The way they hit her, I had to stop and stare (I had to stop and stare)
She's got me love stoned from everywhere
She's bad and she knows, I think that she knows

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Into the distance, a ribbon of black
Stretched to the point of no turning back
A flight of fancy on a windswept field
Standing alone as my senses reel
A fatal attraction is holding me fast
How can I escape this irresistible grasp?

[Chorus]
Can't keep my eyes from the circling sky
Tongue-tied and twisted
Just an earthbound misfit, I

[Verse 2]
Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Unheeded warnings, I thought I thought of everything
No navigator to find my way home
Unladen, empty and turned to stone

[Pre-Chorus 1]
A soul in tension that's learning to fly
Condition grounded but determined to try

[Chorus]
Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
Tonguе-tied and twisted
Just an earthbound misfit, I

[Verse 3]
Abovе the planet on a wing and a prayer
My grubby halo, a vapor trail in the empty air
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly
Out of the corner of my watering eye
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night

[Pre-Chorus 2]
There's no sensation to compare with this
Suspended animation, a state of bliss

[Chorus]
Can't keep my mind from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted
Just an earthbound misfit, I

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
There's no more waiting
Holding out for love
You are my Godsend
That I have been forever dreaming of
My angel from above

[Chorus: Childish Gambino, Childish Gambino & Additional Vocalists]
Heaven knows, head over heels
And it shows, I've played every field
I suppose, but there's something about you
When you're around, baby, I have found
I get lost in you

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
What is this feeling
I've never known before
Uh, that I should dare to
Swear to surrender ever more
That's what I came hеre for

[Chorus: Childish Gambino, Childish Gambino & Additional Vocalists, Additional Vocalists]
Heaven knows
Hеad over heels and it shows
Ooh, it couldn't be
Played every field I suppose
But there's something about you
When you're around, baby, I have found
I get lost in a wonderful daze
Lost in your wonderful ways
Ooh, I get lost
Oh, baby

[Chorus: Childish Gambino, Childish Gambino & Additional Vocalists, Additional Vocalists]
Something about you when you're around
Baby, I have found I, I get lost, yes, I do, yes, I do
Head over heels and it shows
Ooh, played every field I suppose
There is something about you
When you're around, baby, I have found I
Get lost in you

[Verse 1]
Red moon rising like a fire in me
So many questions, she asks them all to me
I have to answer most curiously
Scarlet angel, I am too small to see
Earn, earn, shuffle 'round the big city
Burning the rubber down, crossing the hot concrete
I'm gonna leave town, there is someone to meet
She turns her head around a full three-sixty
Woo

[Verse 2]
Bedroom rising from an old growth tree
Bringing out the sawmill, cutting the twelve-inch beams
Building a pattern, the reservoir to fill with dreams
Rings like Saturn telling their old story
Windmills turn and turn eternally
What do you yearn for? Where do you long to be?
I've been here before, looking at the wild country
Open the screen door, talking with Diane Lee
That's my grandma

[Verse 3]
Radio singing from the corner of the kitchen
I got the oven on, I got the onions wishing
They hadn't made me cry, filling the sink with dishes
Letting them air dry, waiting for the wind's permission
Too many movies got me shivering and shy
Turning the lights out, glistening in the owl's eye
Glimmer like lightning under the violet sky
Shimmer like diamonds, watching the red moon rise
Ooh

[Verse 1]
Her name is Noelle
I have a dream about her
She rings my bell
Got gym class in half an hour
Oh, how she rocks
In Keds and tube socks
But she doesn't know who I am
And she doesn't give a damn about me

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby
I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby
Listen to Iron Maiden, baby, with me
Ooh

[Verse 2]
And her boyfriend's a dick
And he brings a gun to school
And he'd simply kick
My ass if he knew the truth
He lives on my block
He drives an IROC
But he doesn't know who I am
And he doesn't give a damn about me

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby
I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby
Listen to Iron Maiden, baby, with me
Ooh

[Bridge]
Oh, yeah, dirtbag
No, she doesn't know what she's missin'
Oh, yeah, dirtbag
No, she doesn't know what she's missin'

[Verse 3]
Man, I feel like mold
It's prom night and I am lonely
Lo and behold
She's walkin' over to me
This must be fake
My lip starts to shake
How does she know who I am?
And why does she give a damn about me?
I've got two tickets to Iron Maiden, baby
Come with me Friday, don't say maybe
I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby, like you
Ooh

[Outro]
Oh, yeah, dirtbag
No, she doesn't know what she's missin'
Oh, yeah, dirtbag
No, she doesn't know what she's missin'

[Verse 1]
When did you start seeing her?
Guess somebody finally tamed you
Never seen you look so sure
Sorrow snuck into our secret place
Drag me with you to Nirvana, baby
Take me all the way

[Chorus]
Drinkin' just to taste her mouth
Got you drifting in and out

[Verse 2]
Mr. Death wants my baby now
Felt the crowd was wrong to claim you
Won't they ever quiet down?
Someone's daughter adorned in flames
Take me with you to Nirvana, baby
Take me all the way

[Chorus]
Man enough to see this through
Man, I'm nothing without you

[Verse 3]
Thought I’d see her when I died
Filled the bath up with warm water
Nothing on the othеr side

[Chorus]
Man enough to see this through
Or is it one morе thing I won't get to?
Can't go out, I'm tethered to
Another world where we're together

[Outro]
Are you lost in it too?
Are you lost in it too?
Are you lost in it too?
Are you lost in it too?

[Verse 1]
First time I met you, I knew then
Afterwards there'd be
No in-between
We can sail the ocean blue
Or just lie down, you know
How I love you

[Chorus]
Nothing's gonna stop me now
Nothing's gonna stop me now
Nothing's gonna stop me now

[Verse 2]
I wanna wake up early every day
Just to be awake
In the same world as you
I won't ever hurt you
No more endless nights
Only the lightest blues

[Chorus]
If anyone should stop me now
Nothing's gonna stop me now
Nothing's gonna stop me now, now, now, now

[Outro]
I'm not going back
I'm not going back
I'm not going back
I'm not going back

[Verse 1]
Let's go be alone
Where no one can see us, honey
Careful in that room
Those parasitic cameras, don't they stop to stare at you?

[Verse 2]
Can't love for us both
You've gotta live and I gotta go
As long as it's us two
Fuck being remembered, I think I was made for you

[Chorus]
So why'd you wanna erase me, darling valentine?
You'll always know where to find me when you change your mind

[Verse 3]
I'd hate to picture someone with you
I lay down and start to cry
You won't believe what just two months do
I'm older now, believe mе, I adore you

[Chorus]
So why'd you wanna erase mе, darling valentine?
You'll always know where to find me when you change your mind
So why'd you wanna erase me, darling valentine?

[Outro]
Now I can't hate you
I ruined me for you
Blame me if you need to
But I adore you
I adore you
I adore you
I adore you

[Verse 1]
On two, feels like spring
All on my own, guess the shit just makes you boring
Got money, I don't care about sex
You knew how I'd take it, you brought her to flex

[Chorus]
Sucker for the pain, huh, honey?
But you said you'd die
You wanna leave a stain
Like a relapse does when you really tried
And damn, this time, I really tried

[Verse 2]
Moved on, but nothing feels true
Sometimes I hate her just for not being you
Post-rehab, I've been feeling so small
I miss your attention, I wish I could call

[Chorus]
Sucker for the pain, huh, honey?
But you said you'd die
You wanna leavе a stain forever
But you said you'd die
Said you would'vе died for me

[Verse 3]
Raised your voice to me
The second time I had to make myself believe
I deserve it, I'm crazy
But don't act like you've never met me

[Bridge]
I never should've hurt you
I've got the devil in me
I've got the devil in me
I've got the devil in me

[Chorus]
Sucker for the pain, huh, honey?
But you said you'd die
You wanna leave a stain forever
But you said you'd die
Said you would've died for me

[Verse 1]
I might have made a stranger out of you
And I'm stranger too
I know that's not my perfume on you, Tiger
And we don't have long
Doesn't obsession just become me?
Don't let 'em see
We don't owe it to nobody
No matter where we are
I love you from the city to the stars
But nothin' stays as good as how it starts

[Chorus]
You and I
Like a ship, forever sailing
You and I
Everything we try is failing
Everything we do
Everything we try

[Verse 2]
Time tends to pass and make a joke of things, but
Eleven months and still
Some nights I rеach for you
Like you're besidе me
You're takin' her home
Does an obsession just become you?
You're takin' that tone
Icy cold, come on
I loved you

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever you decide
I'll chase you from the city to the sky
And lose myself for you a thousand times

[Chorus]
You and I
Like a ship forever sailing
You and I
Everything we try is failing
Everything we do
Everything we try

[Post-Chorus]
You and I
(Like a ship, forever sailing)
You and I
(Everything we try is failing)
Everything we do
Everything we try

[Outro]
So much destruction
Look at what we did
That was so real
And you don't just forget
So much destruction
Look at what we did
That was so real
And you don't just forget (No more)
So much destruction (Everything is her)
Look at what we did (No more)
That was so real (Everything is her)
And you don't just forget (No more)
So much destruction (Everything is her)
Look at what we did (No more)
That was so real (Everything is her)
You don't just forget (No more)
(Everything is her)
You don't just forget (No more)
(Everything is her)
You don't just forget (No more)
(Everything is her)
You don't just forget (No more)
(Everything is her)

[Verse 1]
You've got a way to you, original Madonna
Won't make the rest just go away
You spent the money, throwing 1's at supermodels
Everybody wants to taste the wine
Line around the block at judgment time
And how could you deny them that-

[Chorus]
Body and blood, lover's curse
Divine intervention was too much work
I don't need absolution, it just hurts
We're not really talking now
We're not really talking now

[Verse 2]
I consecrate my life to kneeling at your altar
My second sin of seven being wanting more
Could that have been the smell of roses, backseat lover?
Praying you'd fill my empty cup
Or cursing myself for even getting dressed up

[Chorus]
Body and blood, lover's curse
Divine intervention was too much work
I don't need absolution, no, it just hurts
We're not really talking now
Body and blood, I'll atone
Get to it now, or we can fight on the phone
I used to wanna get even, I'll just get stoned
Bow to your divinity
Gonna wipe the dirt off me

[Outro]
Our love's a sickness, baby
I'm holding on tight, I don't know why
I've come to hate my body
'Cause now it's not yours, now it's not mine
I don't know why, oh I don't know why but
We're not really talking now
We're not really talking now
We're not really talking now

[Verse 1]
Woke up without why or how
Wasted, asleep on the couch
Routine as it is, I can start everyday
Without all the messin' around
Even with a job that keeps me movin'
Most days I just wanna lie down
Sleep it away 'til it's nothin', and
Pull the blinds all the way down, down, down

[Verse 2]
Sunrise, dead of night
With a come down so early in the mornin'
I hate those long drives
Least we ended things nice
Summer's gotta end sometimes
Oh, Mia

[Verse 3]
Baby blue, I'm so behind
Can’t make sense of the faces in and out of my life
Whirlin' above our daily routines
But we're buriеd in problems, baby honestly
Wish it'd been you the othеr night
Should've been you, but it's alright
Feels like I'm losin' my mind, baby blue
But I'd leave it behind if you wanted me to

[Verse 1]
You want it all
Superstar
Jesus died just to save you
Walk me down
Hollywood Boulevard
Get me high in the hotel room

[Chorus]
You owe me
You own me
I could never hurt you, my love
You know me

[Verse 2]
When it gets cold
We'll move to Malibu
Where the drinks are hard
You make them go down smooth
You wanna make it hurt
Superstar
When you took too much in your bedroom

[Chorus]
You owe me
You own me
I could never hurt you, my love
You know me
You owe me
You own me
Couldn't evеn look at you straight on
Shining in your glory

[Verse 1]
One more drink 'til
I can feel you
And when the party's empty
We can slow dance in my room
Tried life without you
But you in that green sweater
I could die if I had the guts
Puked it up, drank too much
Feed the flame forever

[Chorus]
Automate me
And I'll never find a love like this
I'm free
But who was I to ever want like this?
You got so mean
Pouring out the Jack and consequence
When you're with me
And who was I to ever want like this?

[Verse 2]
Blank lips, dark room
I pretend it's you
But she kissed like she meant it
It's like I'm living, and I'm past her
And it's thirteen days after
But it still feels like I'm cheating
One more drink 'til
I can lay beside you
Though all at once is better

[Chorus]
Automate me
And I'll never find a love like this
I'm free
But who was I to ever want like this?
You got so mean
Pouring out the Jack and consequence
When you're with me
And who was I to ever want like this?

[Outro]
I guess I couldn't keep her fire out
I guess I couldn't keep her fire out
And I'm like your dog
I'm like your dog
Only I know you'll be sweet if I stay
And it's not enough
Conditional love
When I'm old and rotten, you'll be on your way
I guess I couldn't keep her fire out
I guess I couldn't keep her fire out
And childishly I'm lonely when it's time to clear out the party
Automate me

[Verse 1]
Isn't it strange
The way it's just over?
No late night calls
You're not here to walk me to my door
Now I just love you more

[Verse 2]
Mia, don't cry
I love you forever
But I've gotta grow up now
No, I can't keep holding on to you anymore
Mia, I'm still yours

[Chorus]
Lost love, so strange
And heaven's not real, babe
But I wish that I
Could lay down next to you

[Verse 3]
You're fixin' your hair on the way to his place off of Broadway and 9th
If you're wakin' up slow together
And talking through the night
I bet he feels so fuckin' light

[Chorus]
Lost love, so strange
And heaven's not real, babe
Well I wish that I
Could lay down next to you
I wish that I could lay down next to you, you

[Part 1]

[Intro]
Yeah yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah

[Verse 1]
On the phone speaking in code
Sneaky niggas want a piece of your soul
It’s like the conversation change when I’m speaking in goals
And they don’t understand when I speak the creole
Being see sweet don’t mean you think that they hoes
Being C-Suite mean the seat that you chosed
It’s elite, you ain’t gotta speak cause it shows
My skillset freakier than Bohemian Grove
Baby blood only cause the mama brim
Ahead of my time, used to talk to my mama friends
Condolences to the Bakers
Tragedy bring us back together right after it break us
Casualty will always make us neighbors
Jordan made me Bull, but Kobe made me a Laker
Lee Scratch pass, know they crying in Jamaica
The boy stay blessed like the wine with the wafer
Live by my grind like the shaker
Mind my behavior
I park the car for the valet, set the table for the waiters
Totally self sufficient with a whole lot of favors, yeah

[Verse 2]
Blue Note Table, watching jazz on the xylophone
40 Dog, need a chain for my microphone
Chill is gusto, this that 99, headed to the stu’
With the 9 in my backpack on the bus flow
But I had it fucked up like an uh-oh
Chill was like that’s secondary, school is the utmost
I was this close to droppin' out
High school dropping off, range rover hoppin' out, woo (Woo)
Shit was crispy
Beat bringing back memories like they miss me
I ain’t gotta do bars, I can strictly
Rap what really happened, you would think that shit was Disney
Air in the circle like a frisbee
Thinking about my niggas make me misty
All that martial arts make me risky
So you better put a gun to my head while you frisk me, nigga

[Part 2]

[Verse 3]
I’m from the old school, you leave the meeting with a kissed face
I was in hoop shooting J after J like that Fish place
Word to niggas living so rough that the pick breaks
But they still tryna get their shit straight like they mix-raced
I had a Duke, similar to an S-Curl
Same game, tryna impress them out west girls
I listened to Donda, I also listened to Kanye’s mama in real life
That means I’m real twice
Ricardo’s 40, nigga, I remember when we was shorties
Handling watas like a levee in New Orleans
Spitta Andretti Chevy, tailpipe sounding like it’s snoring
Giving out gas, Cavalier raising money while performing
Dee-1 granddad was just chilling while it was storming
That’s how we doing huh, whether whatever weather before me
Tell ‘em welcome to ATL, the city’s all free
And if you wanna see some titties, Magic City’s on me
What up Mayor? What up playa?
What up Drake? What up haters?
Got the clique in my corner just like a stapler
Steady handing out punches just like a labeler
Prom bars, I’m about to start caring about paper
And keep my yells-low like an EA cartridge for Sega
Stay Tyler Durden, but leave my job as a waiter
Or keep the bars and be more intentional to whom I cater
That’s that shit
As conscious as Common Sense
They done let us in door, Go niggas is going in
Whether they throwing folks or niggas is throwing fin?
Vic ain’t smoking smokes, my nigga, that so a 10?
Chance got the movie, Ism just got a plaque
We just got a double, niggas just got a fact
Just left album mode with me and my nigga Trakk
And Drake dropped this shit, got me thinking ‘bout going back
What the fuck
Hello! my name is Olivia! if you're reading this, you probably heard of my album SOUR. I made most of the songs when I was 17 & I'm super proud of the way it captures the strange feelings of that slice of my life. I wrote most of the songs in my bedroom & finish and produced them with my friend Dan Nigro. I've always loved writing music, but creating this album with Dan was one of the greatest joys of my life. I'm writing this before it has come out but I really hope that the songs resonate with people & make them feel a little lеss alone. Anyway I thought I would share some of thе inspiration for SOUR with you guys & show you a little bit of how it was made.‘ Hope you enjoy!!!

1. brutal
Brutal is the first song of the record but the last song I wrote. if that makes any sense. it's really weird & intense which I love. Dan & I wrote it together about two weeks before we had to to turn in the album. The day we wrote it, we went on a drive to go get lunch & take a break from the studio. As we drove around, Dan played me some of his fav 90s grunge songs. I looove 90s grunge & I told him I wanted to write a song like the ones he was playing me. so when we got back to the studio, he came up with this really, simple, sick riff & we wrote brutal! The day before, I over heard someone talk about how “brutal” the entertainment industry was & I remember thinking the word was so interesting & descriptive. I love brutality (haha you get it) honest borderline pathetic lyrics & so we tried to do that in the verses. it's one of my favs songs on the record & I rlly hope you like it!

2. traitor
I wrote most of traitor on my bedroom floor in Salt Lake City. I sort of forgot about it until I sent a bunch of voice memos to Dan & he said he liked this one. We finished it up together & I really like the way it turned out. It sort of feels like and old country song to me which I'm obsessed with

3. drivers license
My first real published song. I literally still can't believe how big it got. Super grateful for everyone who listened. I've talked about how drivers license came to be in like every interview I've ever done, so I'll spare you guys the boring details

4. 1 step forward, 3 steps back
I wrote this song in like March of 2020. The day I wrote it, my mom and I were doing a roadtrip from L.A to Salt Lake City. I was obsessed with Taylor Swift's reputation then and we literally played the whole album over & over the entire 10 hour car drive. I have the best mom ever haha. During that same trip I got a text from someone who was telling me something about their diet or productivity (I don't really remember) & they described their progress as “always one step forward and three steps back”. I had never really heard anyone use that phrase before & I thought it was super cool. when I got home, I decided to take that phrase & write a song over the stunning chords in “ New Year's Day . ” When it came time to put out the album, Jack Antonoff & Taylor Swift, who wrote “New Year's Day” aka my favorite love song of all time, were kind enough to approve my reimagining

5. deja vu
Deja vu was the most stubborn song I've ever made lol. It took Dan & me soo long to get the mix to a good place. We wrote it about a month after we made drivers license and I really liked its unique sound. I'm also literally obsessed with the music video for it. An amazing woman named Allie Avital directed it & my friend Talia Ryder stared in it with me. It was soo much fun

6. good 4 u
Good 4 u is my favorite song on the record. I struggled for a really long time to write upbeat songs because I thought in order to write them I had to talk about being happy or being in love. When I was writing this album I wasn't really feeling any of those joyous feelings lol. good 4 u perfectly captures my feelings of heartbreak in a way that feels really fun. I listen to it while I'm driving sometimes & it feels sort of energizing. I'm super stoked to play it live one day eek!

7. enough for you
I wrote “enough for you” entirely by myself which I'm really proud of. I think its probably the best song I've ever written currently. I really love not only the honesty & vulnerability in it but the hope. In an album full of sad break-up songs, this songs feels like a light at the end of the tunnel, a promise that the feeling wouldn't be forever. The entire song is really just my voice & an acoustic guitar which I think is sick
8. happier
“happier” was the first song I wrote on this record, well, I supposed I didn't know I was ever gonna get to make a record then but nonetheless funnily enough, I actually wrote it in between takes of this super poppy dance number in a show I was filming, which is so ironic. It was one of those songs that the universe gives to people like magic. It felt like the entire song was fully formed, floating & I was just a channel it used to come to life. Woah I sound so fake deep I'm so sorry lol. No but its true, it was a really magical experience. And whats even cooler than that is the fact that this is the song that connected me & my fav colaborator, Dan. He saw a video of this song I posted on Instagram. DMed me, & the rest is history

9. jealousy, jealousy
I wrote jealousy, jealousy with Casey Smith in summer 2020. I was obsessed with bass driven songs & really wanted to make one of my own. We wrote it about the pressures of social media & the terrible insecurity that comes with it. Growing up on the internet has completely distorted my reality in many occasions. I wrote this song during a time where it was hard to not only separate other peoples real life from their social media but my own life from my social media, if that makes any sense. Writing this song was really cathartic for me & I hope other people can relate to it in some way

10. favorite crime
Dan & I wrote favorite crime sometime last summer I think. I had "know I loved you so bad I let you treat me like that" written in my notes app for a while & it sort of sparked the entire song. I really love how the song is one big metaphor. Figurative language was something I had to work on in my songwriting. I'm a very literal, specific writer & similes aren't often where my brain tends to go, so I'm super proud of this song

11. hope ur ok
Hope ur ok is the last song on the record. It's a super special song to me & I love the stories it tells. I wrote most of it in my living room in early 2020, drawing inspiration from some of my favorites country & folk artists. I think my favorite lines I've ever written are “hope he took his bad deal & made a royal flush” & “hope you know how proud I am you were created with the courage to unlearn all of their hatred.” I had so much fun making it & I hope it gives optimism to someone out there just like it did for me

THANK YOU
Thank YOU so much for listening to SOUR. I'm so thankful! I hope this lil diary was somewhat interesting lol

[Verse 1]
This is the first day of my life
Swear I was born right in the doorway
I went out in the rain; suddenly, everything changed
They're spreading blankets on the beach
Yours is the first face that I saw
Think I was blind before I met you
Don’t know where I am
I don’t know where I’ve been
But I know where I want to go

[Chorus]
So, I thought I’d let you know
Yeah, these things take forever
Especially am slow
But I realize that I need you
And I wondered if I could come home

[Verse 2]
Remember the time you drove all night
Just to meet me in the mornin'?
I thought it was strange, you said everything changed
You felt as if you'd just woke up
And you said “This is the first day of my life
Glad I didn’t die before I met you
But now, I don’t care; I could go anywhere with you
And I’d probably be happy”

[Chorus]
So if you wanna be with me
With these things, there’s no tellin'
We just have to wait and see
But I’d rather be workin' for a paycheck
Than waiting to win the lottery
Besides, maybe this time is different
I mean, I really think you like me
Mmm
Mmm

[Verse]
I got chills, they're multiplyin'
And I'm losing control
'Cause the power you're supplyin'
It's electrifyin'
Want you, I want you, to keep you, I got to

[Pre-Chorus]
I better shape up (Ooh, why?)
'Cause I need a plan (Uh-uh-uh-ooh, I)
And my heart is set on you (Heart is set on you)
I better shape up, I better understand
To my heart, I must be true
Nothin' left, nothin' left for me to do

[Chorus]
You're the one that I want
You are the one I want, ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the one that I want
You are the one I want, ooh-ooh-ooh (You're the onе I want)
You're the one that I want
You arе the one I want, ooh-ooh-ooh
The one I need (The one I need)
Oh, yes, indeed (Oh, yes, indeed, yay)
You're the one that I want
You are the one I want, ooh-ooh-ooh (You're the one I want)
You're the one that I want
You are the one I want, ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the one that I want
You are the one I want, ooh-ooh-ooh (Ah)
The one I need (The one I need)
Oh, yes, indeed (Yes, indeed)

[Intro]

[Chorus]
It's high time
I slow my roll
Let the grass just grow and lean way back
It's a fine time
To let it all go
I've been too low, so it's high time
Alright

[Verse]
Been missing my roots
I'm getting rid of the flash
Nobody needs a thousand-dollar suit
Just to take out the trash
Ain't gotta be alone to feel lonely
I'm gonna turn off my phone
Start catching up with the old me

[Chorus]
It's high time
I slow my roll
Let the grass just grow and lean way back
It's a fine time
To let it all go
I've been too low, so it's high time

[?]

[Bridge]
When you've been all wrong
Just wanna feel alright
Tomorrow I might come crashing down
But for tonight

[Chorus]
It's high time
I slow my roll
Let the grass just grow and lean way back
It's a fine time
To let it all go
I've been too low, so it's high time

[Outro]
I'm gonna let it all go
I've been too low, so it's high time

[Verse 1]
Do we really have to grow up?
If we never do, then so what?
So what if I don't wanna, what if I’m just gonna
Stay drunk on all the years that I just wish would slow up?

[Chorus]
We can't do it over
They say it's now or never and all we’re ever gettin' is older
Before we get to heaven, baby, let's give 'em hell
We might as well
'Cause we don't know when we're done
So let's love hard, live fast, die fun
Hmm
Die Fun

[Verse 2]
Let’s put a little more in your glass
Walk around and spend all our cash
Just let me grab my poncho, I don’t care where we go
If we speak the language, you know we don't even have to come back

[Chorus]
We can’t do it over
They say it's now or never and all we're ever gettin' is older
Before we get to heaven, baby, let’s give 'em hell
We might as well
'Cause we don't know when we're done
So let's love hard, live fast, die fun
Hmm
Let's die fun, hey
We can't do it over
They say it's now or never and all we're ever gettin' is older
Before we get to heaven, baby, let's give 'em hell
We might as well
'Cause we don't know when it's done
So let's love hard
Let's stay young
Let's love hard, live fast, die fun
Hmm
Die fun, yeah
We can't do it over, yeah
We can't do it over, hmm

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Outro]
We can't do it over
Thank you!
Yeah!
Thanks for singing with us
Part I: "Step Off"

[Verse 1]
You sure look real pretty in your glass house
You probably think you’re too good to take the trash out
Well, are you dumb? Are you blind?
'Cause it’s a real fine line
Between telling a joke and turning the knife
Don't wreck my reputation
Let me wreck my own

[Chorus]
Step off, step off
Yeah, you're getting too close to me
With all your negativity
Just get lost
Just try to make a little difference
Here's why you gotta interfere
Just keep climbing that mountain of dirty tricks
And when you finally get to the top
Step off
Alright, y'all, come on Spotify!

[Verse 2]
Screwed everybody over in this town
So there ain't nothing between you and the cold, hard ground
Keep running your mouth and stretching the truth
You just might find a hole in your parachute
'Cause whatever gets you high
Will always bring you down

[Chorus]
So step off (Come on!), step off
Yeah, you're getting too close to me
With all your negativity
Just get lost
Just try to make a little difference
Here's why you gotta interfere
Just keep climbing that mountain of dirty tricks
When you finally get to the top (What? Come on!)
Step off
Heyy, hmm

[Outro]
Oh, sticks and stones
May build a throne
But you'll be up there all alone
So step off
Part II: "Three Little Birds"

[Intro]
Alright, we told 'em to step off now
Everything's gonna be alright

[Chorus]
So don't worry
'Bout a thing
Because every little thing
Is gonna be alright
Alright, yeah
I said don't worry
About a thing
Because every little thing
Is gonna be alright (Alright, come on!)

[Verse]
Yeah, I woke up this mornin'
And smiled with the Texas sun
Three little birds
Each by my doorstep
And singing their sweet songs
Melodies pure and true
And sayin', "This is my message to you"

[Chorus]
So don't worry
'Bout a thing
Because every little thing
Is gonna be alright
Alright, yeah
I said don't worry
About a thing
Because every little thing
Is gonna be alright
Okay, I know we got some singers here
Come on!
So don't worry (Go like this!)
About a thing
Because every little thing
Is gonna be alright (Alright, yeah)
I said don't worry
About a thing
Because every little thing
Is gonna be alright

[Outro]
Woo!

[Intro: Kacey Musgraves]
Come on!
I used to live here
So, I know this especially
But, I don't even have to say it
But, Austin, I feel like it's definitely the capital of following your...
Arrow

[Verse 1: Kacey Musgraves]
If you save yourself for marriage, you're a bore
If you don't save yourself for marriage, you're a horrible person
If you won't have a drink, then you're a prude
But they'll call you a drunk as soon as you down the first one

[Verse 2: Kacey Musgraves]
If you can't lose the weight, then you're just fat
But if you lose too much, then you're on crack
You're damned if you do and you'rе damned if you don't
So, you might as well just do whatevеr you want

[Chorus: Kacey Musgraves]
So, make lots of noise (Hey), kiss lots of boys (Yeah)
Or kiss lots of girls if that's somethin' you're into
When the straight and narrow gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint, or don't
Just follow your arrow wherever it points
Yeah, follow your arrow wherever it points

[Verse 3: Kacey Musgraves]
If you don't go to church, you'll go to Hell (Probably)
If you're the first one on the front row, you're a self-righteous son of a...
Can't win for losin', you'll just disappoint 'em
Just 'cause you can't beat 'em, don't mean you should join 'em

[Chorus: Kacey Musgraves]
So, make lots of noise (Hey), kiss lots of boys (Yeah)
Or kiss lots of girls if that's somethin' you're into
When the straight and narrow gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint, or don't, I don't know
Just follow your arrow wherever it points
Yeah, follow your arrow wherever it points

[Bridge: Kacey Musgraves]
Just say what you think (Say what you think)
Love who you love (Love who you love)
'Cause you just get so many trips around the sun
Yeah, you only...
We only live once
So, let's get weird!
Your turn, go!

[Chorus: Crowd, Kacey Musgraves & Crowd]
Make lots of noise (Hey), kiss lots of boys (Yeah)
Or kiss lots of girls if that's what you're into
When the straight and narrow gets a little too straight
Roll up a joint, I would
And follow your arrow wherever it points
Yeah, follow your arrow wherever it points

[Outro]
I love you, Texas!
We got one more song
Lyrics from Snippets

[Intro: Lauryn Hill]
Yo, yo (Check our situation)
My men and my women
(Yo) Yo, yo (Check our situation)
My men and my wom–
(Incoming!)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You need somethin' unexpected, some form of weapon
You ask him to feel protected, and still feel protected
Just one time for the record, just one time for the record
Don't agree with the message, don't agree with the methods

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Don't let, don't let the lifestyle let, let down
We'll let them know when the last time you knew the love
…

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Don't involve yourself in things you don't have to know
So small you laugh them off
Don't involve yourself in things you don't have to know…

[Verse 1: Roddy Ricch]
Shit change when you famous
I remember, back before the chains, we was nameless
Went through stages just to hop on new stages
Open up your eyes, niggas only entertainers
And I cannot sell my soul (Soul)
And I cannot sell my soul (Soul)
And I cannot sell my soul (Yeah, my soul)
And I cannot sell my soul (Jesus saved my soul)
And I cannot sell my soul
I've been at the top shinin' like a light pole
And I'm just a product of what a nigga was raised in
This money sanctified, so I gotta say it again
They said I was mad at the Grammys
But I'm lookin' at my Grammy right now
Pulled up on Ye, and I said, "They don't understand mе"
I just want my dawg to pipe down
'Cause when you rеally came from the trenches
You was raised in the trenches (Mmm)
You feel like you trailblazed for the trenches (Mmm)
I hope God can forgive me for the days that I was sinnin' (Mhm)
The truth is only what you get away with, huh?
(Man, all these lyin' niggas you get what I'm sayin)
I said the truth is only what you get away with, huh?
Ayy, that's why a lot of these niggas be fakin', huh
Made it through the trials and tribulations, huh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
But uh, uh
Well, well, here goes, well, here goes, but here goes
I was one of them weirdos of the pure soul
That would go to the flea market to buy fake clothes
Every color Girbauds, every Cutlass is cold
Every cousin that stole, every summer was cold
Out of all of the Moes, out of all of the Folks
After all of the jokes, I'm the one that was chose
All of my friends love to gangbang
How we in my car and you say we ain't in the same lane?
When we both had Pelles on
And we was scammin' for the prom
Before Chief Keef was "Bang, Bang"
With drugs in the car, without drugs in the car
We still get locked up for the same thing
People still got jokes, 44 telling me I'm still not folks
And I'm the only nigga went to the White House
And said "Free the old man"
Everyday I put my life on the line to feed the whole clan
Personal worth is not what a person is worth
Now I can give a dollar to every person on Earth
Man, it's gotta be God's plan
Man, I swear these boys keep playin'
We gon' have to square up then
We gon' have to send it up then
We gon' have to send it up then
We gon' have to send it up then, uh
We gon' have to send it up then
We gon' have to send it up then
It ain't how it used to be
This the new me, so get used to me
It ain't how it used to be
This the new me, so get used to me
Lookin' in the mirror, it's the truth of me
Lookin' at my kids, it's the proof of me
Devil get behind me, I'm loose, I'm free
Father, Holy Spirit, let loose on me
Father, I'm Yours exclusively
Devil get behind me, I'm loose, I'm free
Father, Holy Spirit, let loose on me
Father, I'm Yours exclusively
Devil get behind me, I'm loose, I'm free
Devil get behind me, I'm loose, I'm free
Jesus don’t help me free
Lyrics from Snippet

Hol' up, I never had smudge on my name (yeah)
Born the same year but we can’t save the same
My d-

[Intro]
We started together right? So it's like, we're gonna, we're gonna finish it together. You know what I mean?

[Chorus]
No hard feelings
You'll always be with me
No hard feelings
After all our history
Know that we got each other's back
Don't look at it like
I gave my heart away
No hard feelings
No hard feelings

[Verse 1]
They got a different relationship
Could never understand us
Don't let the words you read
Go through your head
Never let 'em come between us

[Pre-Chorus]
Open your arms like mine now
Up to the sky, reach out
Hope you want the best for me like I want the best for you
We made a vow

[Chorus]
No hard feelings
You'll always be with me
No hard feelings
After all our history
Know that we got each other's back
Don't look at it like
I gave my heart away
No hard feelings
No hard feelings

[Verse 2]
Happier days, I ain't seen one without ya
Yeah, you keep me in amazement
Ain't been a night I don't pray to God about you
To keep us in his graces

[Pre-Chorus]
Open your arms like mine now
Up to the sky, reach out (Reach out)
Hope you want the best for me like I want the best for you
We made a vow

[Chorus]
No hard feelings
You'll always be with me
No hard feelings
After all our history
Know that we got each other's back
Don't look at it like
I gave my heart away
No hard feelings
No hard feelings

[Outro]
(No hard feelings, no hard feelings)
Oh
Never turn my back on you
(No hard feelings, no hard feelings)
Always be with me
You'll always be with me
My heart is yours, your heart is mine
Your heart is mine
Always by your side

Long as you're breathing, don't stop believing
Long as you're breathing, don't stop believing

This is called Slow Train Comin', it's been comin' a long time and it's pickin' up speed.

Sometimes I feel so low-down and disgusted
Can’t help but wonder what’s happenin’ to my companions
Are they lost or are they found
Have they counted the cost it’ll take to bring down
All their earthly principles they’re gonna have to abandon?
But there's a slow, slow train comin’ up around the bend

I had a woman down in Alabama
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic
She said, “Boy, without a doubt
Have to quit your mess and straighten out
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic”
But there's a slow, slow train comin’ up around the bend

All that foreign oil controlling American soil
Look around you, it’s just bound to make you embarrassed
Sheiks walkin’ around like kings
Wearing fancy jewels and nose rings
Deciding America’s future from Amsterdam and to Paris
But there’s a slow, slow train comin’ up around the bend
Man’s ego is inflated, you know his laws are outdated, they don’t apply no more
You can’t rely no more to be standin’ 'round waitin'
In the home of the brave
Jefferson turnin’ over in his grave
Fools glorifying themselves, trying to manipulate Satan
Now there’s a slow, slow train comin’ up around the bend

Big-time negotiators, false healers and woman haters
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition
But the enemy I see
Wears a cloak of decency
All nonbelievers and man stealers talkin’ in the name of religion
And there’s a slow, slow train comin’ up around the bend

People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting
Oh, you know it costs more to store the food than it do to give it
They say lose your inhibitions
Follow your own ambitions
They talk about a life of brotherly love show me someone who knows how to live it
But there’s a slow, slow train comin’

(Slow train comin')

Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talkin’ boy she could destroy
A real suicide case, but there was nothin’ I could do to stop it
I don’t care about economy
I don’t care about astronomy
But it sure does bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets
But there’s a slow, slow train comin’ up around the bend (up around the bend)
Slow train, there's a slow train comin'

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
If I could only know what you're after
I asked you but you don't have the answer

Come around the front door

You had to pull me up high

Lost hope

[Verse: Kanye West]
No more promo, no more photos
No more logos, no more chokeholds
We on bezos, we get payrolls
Trips to Lagos, connect like LEGOs
We take high roads, make this my eyes closed
Burn false idols, Jesus, disciples
I just drained your pain now, I done bled my vain out
New level the game down, simulation changed
No more problems, no more argue
No more asking "Who really are you?"
You know the real you, last time I saw you
Was inside my rear view, shall I continuе?
Straight from Beirut, Chicago, Beirut
You cray, we cray too, you pray, wе pray too
And that's who we pray to
This show, new me, this show, movie
'Cause no one can play you
New grill, new teeth, new chicks, new beef
Still get, loose leaf, still whip, two seats
Go out, police and no more, for new lease
New crib, new lease, new town, a new lease
All night a new lease, new pound, new piece
Nah son, new teeth, don't think, DC
Let go, they told, they told a new piece
Break all the old chains you got a new piece
A new piece, hold up the two peace
Who lease? and enough of two weeks
Hop off for two weeks
Throw out the two weeks
Hop on some feel some, the feeling, the new week
Pop off the two teeth, some and let go
Lets out the blood and
Let it grat, let it grat
Let it grat, grat, grat, grat, grat
Let it grat, let it grat
Let it grat, grat, grat, grat, grat

[Verse 1]
You think I'm pretty without any makeup on
You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me, so I let my walls come down, down
Before you met me, I was alright
But things were kinda heavy, you brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

[Chorus]
You make me feel like I'm livin' a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now, baby, I believe
This is real, so take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

[Verse 2]
We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece, I'm complete

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

[Chorus]
You make me feel like I'm livin' a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now, baby, I believe
This is real, so take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

[Bridge]
I'ma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
(Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)

[Chorus]
(You) You make me (Make me)
Feel like I'm livin' a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back (No)
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now, baby, I believe
This is real (Oh), so take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

[Outro]
I'ma get your heart racing in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
Let you put your hands on me in my skin-tight jeans
Be your teenage dream tonight
(Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight)

[Verse 1]
There you go again
Head low, putting on a show again
It's the holidays
How come it always ends this way?
Well, you can't take that pressure off you
Just to put it on me
Talking to your friends on the phone
Airing our dirty laundry

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, strawberry, raspberry, candlelight, satellite
Television, x-ray vision
What's it gonna take for you to listen?
Well, you can change your mind now
But you can't change your decision
You can change your mind now
But you can't change your decision

[Chorus]
'Cause I
I don't really wanna talk about it (Mm, mm)
So many times you hurt me so much
So many times you hurt me so much (Mm-hmm, mm)

[Verse 2]
But there you go again
Puttin' on your own rodeo again
Then you push me out, just to flash that smile and lasso me in
Well, I've been here a thousand times, I don't wanna go again
I've been here a thousand times
One thousand and one won't be so bad

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, strawberry, raspberry
Candlelight, satellite
Television, x-ray vision
Ahh, what's it gonna take for you to listen?
Well, you can change your mind now
But you can't change your decision
You can change your mind now
But you can't change your decision

[Chorus]
I
I don't really wanna talk about it (Mm, mm)
So many times you hurt me so much
So many times you hurt me so much (Mm-hmm, mm)
I-I-I
I don't really wanna talk about it
So many times you hurt me so much
Too many times you say that it was over (Ah, ah-ah)

[Outro]
I don't wanna talk about it, woo
Ah, I don't really wanna talk about it, yeah
I don't wanna talk about it, yeah, yeah, yeah
"They'll probably take that word out of it..."

At my door the leaves are falling
A cold wild wind will come
Sweethearts walk by together
And I still miss someone

I go out on a party
And look for a little fun
But I find a darkened corner
'Cause I still miss someone

I never got over those blue eyes
I see them everywhere
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was theirs

I wonder if she's sorry
For leaving what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere
And I still miss someone
Early one morning while making the rounds
I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down
Went right home and I went to bed
I stuck that loving 44 beneath my head

Got up next morning and I grabbed that gun
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but run too slow
They overtook me down in Juarez, Mexico

Laid in the hot joints taking the pill
In walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
He said Willie Lee, your name is not Jack Brown
You're the dirty hop that shot your woman down

I said yes sir, my name is Willie Lee
If you got a warrant, just read it to me
Shot her down because she made me sorе
I thought I was her daddy but she had five morе

When I was arrested I was dressed in black
They put me on train and it took me back
I had no friends for to go my bail
They slapped my dried up carcass in that county jail
Got up next morning about a half past nine
Spied a sheriff coming down the line
Hopped and he coughed as he cleared his throat
He said, come on you dirty hop into that district court

Into the courtroom, my trial began
Where I was handled by twelve honest men
Just before that jury started out
I saw that little judge commence to look about

In about five minutes, in walked a man
Holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read in the first degree
I hollered, lordy lordy, have mercy on me

The judge he smiled as he picked up his pen
Ninety-nine years in the Folsom pen
Ninety-nine years underneath that ground
I can't forget the day I shot my woman down

Come on you hops and listen unto me
Lay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be
Well, they're building a gallows outside my cell
And I've got 25 minutes to go
And the whole town's waiting just to hear me yell
I got 24 minutes to go

Well, they gave me some beans for my last meal
With 23 minutes to go
But nobody asked me how I feel
I got 22 minutes to go

Well, I sent for the governor and the whole durn bunch
With 21 minutes to go
And I called up the mayor but he's out to lunch
I got 20 more minutes to go

Then the sheriff said boy, I'm gonna watch you die
With 19 minutes to go
So I laughed in his face and I spit in his eye
With 18 minutes to go

Now here comes the preacher for to save my soul
With 13 minutes to go
And he's talking about burning but I'm so cold
12 more minutes to go
Well, they're testing the trap and it chills my spine
11 more minutes to go
And the trap and the rope, aw, they work just fine
10 more minutes to go

Well, I'm waiting for the pardon that'll set me free
With 9 more minutes to go
But this ain't the movies, so forget about me!
8 more minutes to go

With my feet on a trap and my head in the noose
5 more minutes to go
Won't somebody come and cut me loose?
7 more minutes to go

I can see the mountains, I can see the sky
With 3 more minutes to go
And it's too durn pretty for a man to wanna die
2 more minutes to go

I can see the buzzards, I can hear the crows
1 more minute to go
And now I'm swinging and here I go-whoa-whoa-whoa...

[Spoken Word]
"Thank you very much. I want to do another song here featuring the harmonic-y. Then I want to get the stool there and sit down and do some, uh, slow ballad type songs that we wanted to do for this album, and especially for you. What did I do with my list over there? My idiot sheet. It hit the floor, didn't it? Excuse me. How you doing, Shirley?"
Hey, look yonder comin'
Comin' down that railroad track
Hey, look yonder comin'
Comin' down that railroad track
It's that Orange Blossom Special
Bringin' my baby back

"Have to change harmonicas faster than kiss a duck!"

Going down to Florida
Get some sand in my shoes
Or maybe Californ-ee
And get some sand in my shoes
Ride that Orange Blossom Special
And lose these New York blues

"Hey man, when you goin' back to Florida?
Say, I don't know. I don't know if I'll ever go back to Florida
But ain't you worried about getting your nourishment in New York?
Well, I don't care if I do die, do die, do die, do die, do die..."
Hey, talk about ramblin'
She's the fastеst train on the line
Hey, talk about travеlin'
She's the fastest train on the line
It's that Orange Blossom Special
Rollin' down the seaboard line
Ten years ago, on a cold dark night
Someone was killed 'neath the town hall lights
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me

She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

The judge said, son, what is your alibi?
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die
I spokе not a word, though it meant by life
I'd been in the arms of my bеst friend's wife

(Laughter) Did I hear somebody applaud?

Now the scaffold is high and eternity is near
She stood in the crowd and she shed not a tear
But sometimes at night, when the cold wind moans
In a long black veil, she cries over my bones
She walks these hills in a long black veil
She visits my grave when the night winds wail
Nobody knows, nobody sees
Nobody knows but me

"Can I have a glass of water? Huh? Alright? Let me have a drink of water, I'm about to choke up. That cocaine blues. We got a special surprise for you fellas, especially for one fella in a few minutes. We're going to record a brand new song that I just sang last night for the very first time. It was written by someone here in Folsom Prison. Can I get a drink of water? Last time I was here, I had a drink of water. And I don't know what the hell it run off of. I think it must have run off of Luther's boots or something. Is that water? You promise that's water, huh? Is that water, Bob? (Coughs) That's water. They serve everything in tin cups? (Laughs) You caught it, didn't you?"

"I have an announcement here. Sandoval- Sandoval... S-A-N-D-O-V-A-L, Sandoval. 88419 is wanted in reception."
There's a lot of strange men in cell block ten
But the strangest of them all
Was a friend of mine who spent his time
Staring at the wall, staring at the wall

As he looked at the wall so strong and tall
I heard him softly curse
Nobody at all ever climbed that wall
But I'm going to be the first, I'm going to be the first

Then the warden walked by and said son don't try
I'd hate to see you fall
Because there is no doubt they'll carry you out
If you ever touch that wall, if you ever touch that wall

Well a yеar went by since...

"(Laughs) Ain't it the truth? Thеy're mean bastards, ain't they?"

Well a year's gone by since he made his try
But I can still recall
How hard he tried and the way he died
But he never made that wall, never made that wall
Well there's never been a man who shook this can
But I knew a man who tried
The newspapers called it a jailbreak plan
But I know it was suicide, I know it was suicide
"Well, we would like- I would like to do a couple of love songs for you now. One, you know a man's best friend is his dog, if he's got nothing else. And, uh, this song is about a dog..."

Well, he's not very handsome to look at
He's shaggy and eats like a hog
And he's always killing my chickens
That dirty old egg-sucking dog

Egg-sucking dog
I'm gonna stomp your head in the ground
If you don't stay out of my hen house
You dirty old egg-sucking hound

Now if he don't stop eating my eggs up
Though I'm not a real bad guy
I'm going to get my rifle and send him
To that great chicken house in the sky
From the backdoor of your life, you swept me out dear
In the bread line of your dreams, I lost my place
At the table of your love, I got the brush off
At the Indianapolis of your heart, I lost the race

I've been washed down the sink of your conscience (Gulp!)
In the theater of your love, I lost my part
And now you say you've got me out of your conscience
I've been flushed from the bathroom of your heart

In the garbage disposal of your dreams, I've been ground up dear
On the river of your plans, I'm up the creek
Up the elevator of your future, I've been shafted
On the calendar of your events, I'm last week

I've been washed down the sink of your conscience
In the theater of your love I lost my part
And now you say you've got me out of your conscience
I've been flushed from the bathroom of your heart
"Last time we were here at Folsom Prison, they were hanging Joe Bean. Is Joe still here...Joe Bean? Hang the son of a bitch anyways, right?"

[Spoken Word]
Well, they're hanging Joe Bean this morning, for killing a man in Arkansas. Funny thing about it, Joe Bean has never been to Arkansas. On top of that, Joe Bean never heard of the man. In fact, today is Joe Bean's twentieth birthday...

See through the prison bars, Joe Bean
See where the gallows stand
Just twеnty short years from the day you werе born
You died by the hangman's hand

Yes, they're hanging Joe Bean this morning
For a shooting that he never did
He killed twenty men by the time he was ten
He was an unruly kid
Yes, they're hanging Joe Bean for the one shooting
That Joe Bean never did

Well, Joe, your mother is at the Capitol
Asking the governor for a stay
And it's hard on her 'cause she knows where you were
On that particular day
You were working Joe Bean, hard working
Robbing the Santa Fe
Well, the telegraph wires are humming
Here, the governor's words come through
He said, I can't set you free, it's not up to me
But there's much, Joe Bean, I'll do
I'll join your mother in extending birthday greetings to you

Happy birthday, Joe Bean!

"June Carter! Let's get June out here! Let's get June Carter and the Tennessee Three back out right now."
"Hey, will you sing a song with me?"
"I'd be very pleased to sing a song with you!"
"You sure look nice!"
"Thank you, I'm glad to be back in Folsom!"
"Oh, I like - (laughs) I like to watch you talk."
"I'm talkin' with my mouth! (Laughs) Up here!"

We got married in a fever
Hotter than a pepper sprout
We've been talkin' 'bout Jackson
Ever since the fire went out

I'm going to Jackson
I'm gonna mess around
Yeah, I'm goin' to Jackson
Look out Jackson town

Well, go on down to Jackson
Go ahead and wreck your health
Go play your hand, you big-talkin' man
Make a big fool of yourself
Yeah, go to Jackson
Go comb your hair
Honey, I'm gonna snowball Jackson
See if I care

Well, when I breeze into that city
People gonna stoop and bow
All them women gonna make me
Teach 'em what they don't know how

I'm goin' to Jackson
You turn loose my coat
'Cause I'm goin' to Jackson
Goodbye, that's all she wrote

But they'll laugh at you in Jackson
And I'll be dancin' on a Pony Keg
They'll lead you 'round town like a scolded hound
With your tail tucked between your legs

Yeah, I'll go to Jackson
You big-talkin' man
And I'll be waitin' in Jackson
Behind my Japan Fan

Well now, we got married in a fever
Hotter than a pepper sprout
We've been talkin' 'bout Jackson
Ever since the fire went out
I'm goin' to Jackson
And that's a fact
Yeah, we're goin' to Jackson
Ain't never comin' back

Well, we got married in a fever
Hotter than a pepper sprout

"How much time we got? About fifteen minutes?"
"Anybody got any special requests for us to do? John Henry? Let me do John Henry..."

John Henry's pappy woke him up one midnight
He said before the sheriff comes I wanna tell you
He said listen boy...
Said learn to ball a jack and learn to lay a track
Learn to pick and shovel too
And take my hammer, it’ll do anything you tell it to

John Henry's mammy had about a dozen babies
John Henry's pappy told tale about a dozen times
The babies all got sick and when the doctor wanted money
He said I’ll pay you quarter at a time, startin' tomorow
That's the pay for a steel driver on this line

Then the section foreman said hey hammer swinger
I see you brought your own hammer boy, but what else can all those muscles do?
And he said, I can hoist a jack, I can lay a track
I can pick and shovel too
He said, can you swing that hammer?
I can I'll do anything you hire me to
Now ain't you something
You're so high and mighty with your muscles
Go ahead, boy,  pick up that hammer, show me what you can do
He said get a rusty spike and hammer it down three times
I'll pay you a nickel a day for every inch you sink it to
Go on and do what you say you can do

With a steep nose hammer on a four foot switch panel
John Henry raised it back till it touched his heels
Then the spike went through the cross tie and it split it half in two
35 cents a day for driving steel
Said, sweat sweat boy, sweat, you owe me two more swings
I was born for driving steel

Well John Henry hammered in the mountains
He'd give a grunt and he’d give groan with every swing
The women folks for miles around heard him and come down
To watch him make the cold steel ring, Lord what a swinger
Just listen to that cold steel ring

But the bad boss come up laughing at John Henry
Said you full of vinegar now, but you ’bout through
We gonna get a steam drill to do your share of driving
Then what's all them muscles gonna do, huh John Henry?
Gonna take a little bit of vinegar out of you
John Henry said I feed four little brothers and my baby sister’s walking on her knees
Did the Lord say that machines oughta take the place of living
And what's a substitute for bread and beans, I ain't seen it
Do engines get rewarded for their steam?

John Henry said to his captain, a man ain't nothin but a man
But if you bring that steam drill round, I’ll beat it fair and honest
I'll die with my hammer in my hand, but I'll be laughing
'Cause you can't replace a steel driving man

There was a big crowd of people at the mountain
John Henry said to the steam drill how is you
Pardon me mister steam drill, I suppose you didn't hear me, I said how are you?
This hammer swinger's talking to you

2,000 people hollered go John Henry
Then somebody hollered the mountain's caving in
John Henry told the captain, tell the kind folks don't worry
That ain't nothin but my hammer suckin' wind
It keeps me breathing, a steel drivers muscle I intend

Captain tell the people move back further
I'm at the finish line and I ain't no drill
It's so far behind you ain't got the brains to quit it
When she blows up she'll scatter cross the hills, Lord Lordy
When she blows up she'll scatter cross the hills
Now John Henry had a little woman
I believe the lady's name was Polly Ann
Yeah that was his good woman
John Henry threw his hammer over his shoulder and went on home
Early next morning he said come here Polly Ann come here sugar
I believe this is the first time I ever watched the sun come up that I couldn't come up with it!

Dirty minds! (laughs)

He said, take my hammer Polly Ann and go to that rail road
Swing that hammer like you seen me do it, tell em

I can hoist a jack, and I can lay a track
I can pick and shovel too, ain't no machine can
That's been proved to you

There was a big crowd of mourners at the church house
The section hands laid him in the sand
Trains go by on the rails John Henry laid
They slow down and take off their hats, the men do, when they come to where he's laid
Rests on his back, some say morning steel driver you sure were a hammer swinger, then they go along picking up speed

Yonder lies a steel driving man
Yonder lies a steel driving man, lord lord
Yonder lies a steel driving man

"Thank you very much. You know, John Henry was a real man, he worked on the tunnel in West Virginia, building a tunnel for the C&L Railroad. He was a mighty big man, they say that from his heels on around to the ground he had a stroke of nineteen feet. Whew, that's a long stroke!"
I found him by the railroad track this morning
I could see that he was nearly dead
I knelt down beside him and I listened
Just to hear the words the dying fella said

He said they let me out of prison out in Frisco
For ten long years I paid for what I done
I was trying to get back to Louisiana
To see my Rose and get to know my son

Give my love to Rose, please won't you, mister?
Take her all my money, tell her buy some pretty clothes
Tell my boy that daddy's so proud of him
And don't forget to give my love to Rose

Won't you tеll them I said thanks for waiting for me
Tell my boy to hеlp his mom at home
Tell my Rose to try to find another
'Cause it ain't right that she should live alone

Mister, here's the bag with all my money
It won't last them long the way it goes
God bless you for finding me this morning
Now don't forget to give my love to Rose
Give my love to Rose, please won't you, mister?
Take her all my money, tell her buy some pretty clothes
Tell my boy that daddy's so proud of him
And don't forget to give my love to Rose
On a Monday I was arrested (Uh-huh)
On a Tuesday they locked me in the jail (Oh boy)
On a Wednesday, my trial was attested
On a Thursday, they said guilty and the judge's gavel fell

[Chorus]
I got stripes, stripes around my shoulders
I got chains, chains around my feet
I got stripes, stripes around my shoulders
And them chains, them chains, they're about to drag me down

[Verse 2]
On a Monday, my mama come to see me
On a Tuesday, they caught me with a file
On a Wednesday, I'm down in solitary
On a Thursday, I start on bread and water for a while

[Chorus]
I got stripes, stripes around my shoulders
I got chains, chains around my feet
I got stripes, stripеs around my shoulders
And them chains, them chains, thеy're about to drag me down

[Chorus]
I got stripes, stripes around my shoulders
I got chains, chains around my feet
I got stripes, stripes around my shoulders
And them chains, them chains, they're about to drag me down

"Hey, this microphone's got a screw loose here. Somebody come screw this microphone? (Laughs) What'd I say? Just a minute, let me fix this. Alright..."
The last time
The last time we were here I was two
I watched you reappear from the scarlet sky
The wild geese were returning
Falling embers from the burning April sun

How this place has changed, like my voice
The wildflowers drink the rain, they have no choice
All their faces getting wet
They just sway so slow and let the water wash them
Now your eyеs too, fill with water
As your face turns to your daughter, dull and grеy
What's a valley gonna say as her trees are stripped away without warning

The last time we were here the wind was colder
Snow rose to my ear, and to your shoulder
I took a crooked photograph
Froze the second of your laughter, rosy cheeks
Now the months turn into weeks
As the violet crystal shrinks, you may not meet her
What's the winter gonna do
As her ice runs hot and blue

[Verse 1]
I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowin' my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin' I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothin' but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

[Verse 2]
These days, I haven't been sleepin'
Stayin' up playin' back myself leavin'
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughin' from the passenger's side
And realized I loved you in the fall
And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowin' my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin' I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothin' but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

[Bridge]
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinkin'
Probably mindless dreamin'
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

[Chorus]
But this is me swallowin' my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin' I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothin' but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
All the time
"Here it is again, "San Quentin" just for you!"

[Verse 1]
San Quentin, you've been livin' hell to me
You've guarded me since nineteen sixty three
I've seen 'em come and go and I've seen them die
And long ago I stopped asking why

[Verse 2]
San Quentin, I hate every inch of you
You've cut me and you've scarred me through and through
And I'll walk out a wiser weaker man
Mister Congressman, you can't understand

[Verse 3]
San Quentin, what good do you think you do?
Do you think I'll be different when you're through?
You bent my heart and mind and you warp my soul
And your stone walls turn my blood a little cold

[Verse 4]
San Quentin, may you rot and burn in hell
May your walls fall and may I live to tell
May all the world forget you ever stood
And may all the world regret you did no good

[Outro]
San Quentin, you've been living hell to me

(applause)

"Thank you. All right, we'll do it again after a while. Before we go tonight, we'll do it again. I kind of like it myself now."
"Hello, I'm Johnny Cash. Well, all right!"

Well, I taught the weeping willow how to cry
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
And the tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die

I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota
And it tore me up every time I heard her drawl, Southern drawl
Then I heard my dream went back downstream, cavorting in Davenport
And I followed you, big river, when you called

Then you took me to St. Louis, later on down thе river
And a freighter said shе's been here but she's gone, boy, she's gone
I found her trail in Memphis but she just moved up the bluff
Raised a few eyebrows and went on down alone

Now, won't you batter down by Baton Rouge, river queen roll it on
Take that woman on down to New Orleans, New Orleans
Go on, I've had enough, dump my blues down in the gulf
She loves you, big river, more than me
"It's good to be with you. June said she knew there'd be some people from the South here tonight, because some of you guys get out in here in California and the damn place is so crazy, you just gotta get something to eat some way, don't you? (Laughs) I'm glad to see you again."

At my door the leaves are falling
A cold wild wind will come
Sweethearts walk by together
And I still miss someone

I go out on a party
And look for a little fun
But I find a darkened corner
'Cause I still miss someone

No, I nеver got over those bluе eyes
I see them everywhere
I miss those arms that held me
When all the love was there

I wonder if she's sorry
For leaving what we'd begun
There's someone for me somewhere
And I still miss someone
Well, they gave him his orders at Monroe, Virginia
Said Steve, you're way behind time
This is not 38 this is old 97
Put her into Spencer on time

Then he turned around and said to his black greasy fireman
"Shovel on a little more coal
And when we cross that White Oak Mountain
Watch old 97 roll"

Then a telegram come from Washington station
This is how it read
"Oh, that brave engineer that has run old 97
Is lying in old Danville, dead"

He was going down the grade making 90 miles an hour
His whistle broke into a scream
He was found in the wreck with his hand on the throttle
Scalded to death by the steam

So now all you pretty ladies you better take a warning
From this time on and learn
Never speak hard words to your true loving husband
He may leave you and never return, poor boy
"I want to thank you. It’s good to see you."
"You know, we've been on tour for about a week now, after our last recording session, and they say old Johnny Cash works good under pressure. Put the screws on me and I'm gonna screw right out from under you, is what I'm gonna do though. Tired of all that shit. By God, that's right. All right! I tell you what, the show is being recorded and televised for England, and uh, they said, they told me, they said 'you gotta do this song, you gotta do that song, you gotta stand like this and act like this.' I just don't get it, man, you know? I'm here to do what you want me to and what I want to do, right? So what do you want to hear? All right, all right. I Walk the Line!"

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line

I find it very, very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day is through
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line

As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line

You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you, I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk the line
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds
Because you're mine, I walk the line
"Last week in Nashville, Bob Dylan, one of the top writers... Well, I don't have to tell you who Bob Dylan is, the greatest writer of our time was at our house. And he and I sat down and wrote a song together, let me see if I can find... yeah, here it is. It's called "Wanted Man." Do you know the introduction, Bob?"

Wanted man in California, wanted man in Buffalo
Wanted man in Kansas City, wanted man in Ohio
Wanted man in Mississippi, wanted man in old Cheyenne
Wherever you might look tonight you might see this wanted man

I might be in Colorado or Georgia by the sea
Working for some man who may not know at all who I might be
If you ever see me coming and if you know who I am
Don't you breathe it to nobody 'cause you know I'm on the lam

Wanted man by Lucy Watson, wanted man by Jeannie Brown
Wanted man by Nellie Johnson, wanted man in this next town
Well, I've had all that I wanted of a lot of things I had
And a lot more than I needed of some things that turned out bad

I got sidetracked in El Paso, stopped to get myself a map
Went the wrong way into Juarez with Juanita on my lap
Then I went to sleep in Shreveport, woke up in Abilene
Wondering why the hell I'm wanted at some town halfway between
Wanted man in Albuquerque, wanted man in Syracuse
Wanted man in Tallahassee, wanted man in Baton Rouge
There's somebody set to grab me anywhere that I might be
And wherever you might look tonight, you might get a glimpse of me

Wanted man in California, wanted man in Buffalo
Wanted man in Kansas City, wanted man in Ohio
Wanted man in Mississippi, wanted man in old Cheyenne
Wherever you might look tonight you might see this wanted man
"We want to thank the officials of San Quentin Prison, all of the guards for helping us out. The warden, every one of them. Appreciate it."

(Boos)

"Aww, you don't really mean that now!"

(laughter, applause)

"Yeah, water, yeah. Can I have a drink of water? Is the water bad here? Hey, you know something? They're doing a discography, whatever that is, on Johnny Cash records. You wanna hear a good line? They serve everything in tin cups around here. That's the second song from now. Third song from now. Hey, you think I didn't get water in a tin cup? Listen! Hello, I'm Johnny Cash!"

"I want to tell you about the three fellas that make the great sound behind me. Two of them have been with me for about thirteen years. There's Marshall Grant. From Jackson, Tennessee, W.S. Holland. And just recently joining our group, from Tulsa, Oklahoma, Bob Woolton."

I hear the train a comin', it's rolling 'round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone

When I was just a baby my mama told me, "Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns"
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry
I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free
But those people keep a-movin' and that's what tortures me

Well if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away

[Verse 1]
Love is a burning thing
And it makes a fiery ring
Bound by wild desire
I fell in to a ring of fire

[Chorus]
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down and the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire. the ring of fire

[Chorus]
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down and the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire, the ring of fire

[Verse 2]
The taste of love is sweet
When hearts like ours meet
I fell for you like a child
Oh, but the fire went wild

[Chorus]
I fell in to a burning ring of fire
I wеnt down, down, down and the flames went highеr
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire, the ring of fire

[Chorus]
I fell into a burning ring of fire
I went down, down, down and the flames went higher
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire, the ring of fire

[Outro]
And it burns, burns, burns
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
The ring of fire
"Thank you very much. We'd like to hit one serious note for you, even if the note is out of tune, we'd like to hit a serious note right now. June and I went to the land of Israel in the month of May last year, with a tape recorder, we took it with us. And there are some things in this world that everybody wants to see or hear at one time or another in their life. Especially for you fellas, I think it would feel real good if we could bring back sounds of the pеople and the places. I know a lot of you just likе I was, they were always dear to you, the stories and the songs about Israel. We went to Nazareth, and went to the Sea of Galilee, to Tiberius, we went to Jerusalem, the way of the cross, went to the Wailing Wall. All these sounds are on the album for you to hear. We hope that you'll enjoy some of it."

"I'd like to tell you a real happening in this album. We went into the little town of Cana, just over the hills from Nazareth. And there's a church that sits over the cistern where the water came from that Christ turned to wine, where the first miracle was performed. We went into the church, saw the cisterns. You could hear the water in there, hear the echo. I was so impressed when I came out of the church. If I ever had an inspiration, I had one then from what I had seen and heard. I said under my breath, He turned the water into wine, of all things. On the way to Tiberius, in the car, in the next few minutes, I wrote this song..."

He turned the water into wine
He turned the water into wine
In the little Cana town the word went all around
That He turned the water into wine

Well he walked upon the Sea of Galilee
He walked upon the Sea of Galilee
Shouted far and wide, He calmed the raging tide
And walked upon the Sea of Galilee

He turned the water into wine, didn't my Lord, now?
He turned the water into wine
In the little Cana town the word went all around
That He turned the water into wine

He fed the hungry multitude
He fed the hungry multitude
With a little bit of fish and bread they said everyone was fed (5,000)
He fed the hungry multitude
He turned the water into wine, didn't the carpenter from Nazareth?
He turned the water into wine
In the little Cana town the word went all around
That He turned the water into wine

He turned the water into wine
"And Carl Perkins wrote us another song, that tells about the reason for it all. It takes us back home and tells it like it was when I was a little bitty kid. We gathered around the piano, me and little brother would join in, and mama would sing tenor and daddy'd sing bass."

I remember when I was a lad
Times were hard and things were bad
But there's a silver lining behind every cloud
Just poor people, that's all we were
Trying to make a living out of black land dirt
We'd get together in a family circle singing loud

Daddy sang bass, Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
Singing seems to help a troubled soul
One of these days and it won't be long
I'll rejoin them in a song
I'm going to join the family circle at the throne

No, the circle won't be broken
By and by, Lord, by and by
Daddy sang bass, Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
Now I remember after work
Mama would call in all of us
You could hear us singing for a country mile
Now little brother has done gone on
But I'll rejoin him in a song
We'll be together again up yonder in a little while

Daddy sang bass, Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
Singing seems to help a troubled soul
One of these days and it won't be long
I'll rejoin them in a song
I'm going to join the family circle at the throne

No, the circle won't be broken
By and by, Lord, by and by
Daddy sang bass, Mama sang tenor
Me and little brother would join right in there
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
(Chorus)
Shake your head
Shake your head
Shake your head
Shake your, shake your head

(Verse 1)
You can't argue with death
You can't break a girlie sailor's neck
You can't drink lava from plastic glasses
You can't influence the masses

(Verse 2)
You can't sue Buddah for libel
You can't rewrite the Bible
You can't hit homers like Babe Ruth
And you can't put your finger on the truth

(Chorus)
Shake your head
Ooo
Ooo, ooo
Ooo
Ooo, ooo
(Verse 3)
You can't sing underwater
You can't have the boss's daughtеr
You can't make missiles out of mud
And you can't purify bad blood (let's go to bеd)

(Chorus)
Head
Ooo, let's go to bed

Shake your head
Shake your head
Shake your head
Shake your head

[Verse 1]
Give me some time on Earth to know you
Help me unearth the map and show you
Thinking of her, thinking of him, want to?
When you touch me

[Verse 2]
Mirror in the sky
Making me cry again
Roll up the sheets, suddenly frozen
Like a knife carving through my thick skin
When you touch me
When you touch me

[Verse 3]
Hearing you sigh soft and heavy
Holding mine 'til you feel ready
Flower of blood bloom on my tongue, steady
When you touch me
When you touch me

[Bridge]
Flower of blood
Flower of blood bloom on my tongue

[Verse 4]
When you find the lonely tower
Climb inside the darkеst room
Feel afraid, surrender your power
Whеn you touch me
When you touch me
When you touch me

[Outro]
Feel afraid, surrender your power
(Verse)
To hold me just like a Colby, scratching with no riff
And you’ll find out how I’m living cause I’m gift is mad swift
Using lips or clips leaving motherfuckers stiff
Move so many key (kis) my first name is Lock, last is Smith
If a nigga ever gets up the nerve to really want to be the herb
With the stick, he gets kicked to the curb
From the dark like a blackout, here to act out
Bring a full pack out, and blow your motherfuckin back out
Shouldn’t have put the contract out, on yourself
Or be an ass nigga, just like the last nigga
Take this blast nigga, to the place you know you going
Probably to hell, see you there, still flowing
The game don’t stop, it goes on and on
Some shit I done might not been right, but I ain’t never been wrong
I’m too strong, and you couldn’t pay a sucker to win
Or against this black motherfucker again
Yo, this sin is what I thrive on and live by
Don’t have my ends and you force me to relive my
Other life, as an uncontrollable savage
Killing niggas over a little cabbage, because I just can’t have it
Reach out and grab it, and I rip your arm off
At the shoulder and beat your head with it cause I’m colder than the Arctic
So I write nothing but frozen rhymes
Only eat frozen foods, but I can cook frozen minds
Run it to bear the mark of the beast, I be the spark of the East
That shit you talk, in the dark it’ll cease
Slide out like grease, cause I’m slick like that
What’s up with your man, sucking my dick like that?
Riding rough is how we do things, it’s a crew thing
And swinging on my nuts cause more than like they do hang
Banged ya up so bad you couldn’t get help from Maaco
Stuffed into my grave like Dave out in Waco
So take yo, nondescript ass, bitch ass
To back where you came from, quick fast, or get trashed
Cause that’s just what yo style is
And I see y’all niggas really don’t know what wild is
Have you ever been through a fifth story window
Or shook my a jet black pit with some brindle
Got shot at, or got shot, nine slugs is hot
Go through that, and then you might be on my level…NOT
Yo give money some room, not, fuck it you heard my peeps
And they don’t usually say much, cause they just creep
So you know that your ass is ghost with your rep
So the thing is how you leaving, through the window or the steps

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
I ain’t Cupid, I know you love hard days
I know you love gettin’ yo’ way, you’re used to it

Ya body’s such a gift, your vibes one in a million

[Verse 2: Chevy Woods]
Uh, ha, yeah
Her boyfriend wanna be, but he not like us
That cash money takin’ over, she gon’ back that up
Ain’t gotta pay for it
She wanna flight, she can’t wait for it
She speedin’ to it like a race for it
I told her “Baby pull up right now
And wherever you want, I’ll take you down
Just don’t tell ya nigga cause he a clown
Look, I got a spot we could meet downtown”
And that’s a quick play
Been on vacation for six days
Six four in a six tray, six fives, what the lick say?
We took chances to get paid
We hit the club and 

[?] change
I got the call, I was ready to ball like draft day
Met her on the north, hand to hand in the hallway
Said she like Chardonnay and music by Sha-Day
Got the money as a Peewee and now it’s the Longway
Yeah

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
No I ain’t like them other ones, we could just have fun
Just have fun, just have fun
No I ain’t like them other ones, we could just have fun
Just have fun, just have fun, just have fun

[Verse 1]
All the roses are red, and Jupiter too
I'm lying in my nightgown making confessions to you
It's all over now, baby blue
All my secrets are out, I told them all to you

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's a little grim, but I sing a hymn, only for you
I seal it with a kiss and it goes like this, baby love me too

[Chorus]
If I die young let me die in California
And when I'm gone, let 'em play my favorite song
It's Jimmy Buffett to remember, life's a beach, baby enjoy it

[Post-Chorus]
When I'm done, let the music play on
And on, and on, and on (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Go on, and on, and on

[Verse 2]
All my stories are out, all the lies are out too
When we drive in the nighttime I lift them up to you

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's a little grim, but I sing a hymn, only for you
I seal it with a kiss and it goes like this, baby love me too

[Chorus]
If I die young let me die in California
And when I'm gone, make 'em play my favorite song
It's Jimmy Buffett to remember, life's a beach, baby enjoy it

[Post-Chorus]
When I'm done, let the music play on
And on, and on, and on (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Go on, and on, and on

[Bridge]
Be my baby (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Be my baby tonight
We'll go on, and on, and on
Be my baby (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Be my baby tonight
Go on, and on, and on

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a little grim, but I sing a hymn, only for you
I seal it with a kiss and it goes like this

[Outro]
We'll go on, and on, and on
Be my baby (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Be my baby tonight
Go on, and on, and on

[Verse 3]

I need

And baby come close tonight

[Chorus: Doja Cat]
Can you kiss me more?
We're so young, boy, we ain’t got...

[Verse ?: Joba]
Talking to the stars, do you copy?

[Verse ?: Matt Champion]
-tasy, fantasy
(I like you)
Something I'm trained to 

[?]
I cannot believe it if I really, really tried
World 

[?] when 

[?] into my life

[Part 2]

[Verse: bearface]

[?], make you mine (I like that)
But I wonder if I read your mind

[Verse 1]
Called you on the phone today
Just to ask you how you were
All I did was speak normally
Somehow, I still struck a nerve
You got me messed up in the head, boy
Never doubted myself so much
Like, am I pretty? Am I fun, boy?
I hate that I give you power over that kinda stuff

[Chorus]
'Cause it's always one step forward and three steps back
I'm the love of your life until I make you mad
It's always one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me?
Boy, I don't understand
No, I don't understand

[Verse 2]
And maybe in some masochistic way
I kind of find it all exciting
Like, which lover will I get today?
Will you walk me to the door or send me home crying?

[Chorus]
It's one step forward and three steps back
I'm the love of your life until I make you mad
It's always one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me?
Boy, I don't understand

[Bridge]
No, it's back and forth, did I say something wrong?
It's back and forth, going over everything I said
It's back and forth, did I do something wrong?
It's back and forth, maybe this is all your fault instead

[Chorus]
It's one step forward and three steps back
And I'd leave you, but the rollercoaster's all I've ever had
Yeah, it's one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me?
Boy, I don't understand
No, I don't understand

[Verse 1]
Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And tradin' jackets
Laughin' 'bout how small it looks on you
(Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)
Watching reruns of Glee
Bein' annoying, singin' in harmony
I bet she's braggin' to all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm

[Pre-Chorus]
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you

[Chorus]
Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Ah) Hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?

[Verse 2]
Do you call her, almost say my name?
'Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound thе same
Another actress
I hatе to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
'Cause you played her "Uptown Girl"
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse (Ooh; I love you)

[Pre-Chorus]
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was the show we talked about
Played you the songs she's singing now when she's with you

[Chorus]
Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Oh-oh)
Do you get déjà vu?

[Bridge]
Strawberry ice cream in Malibu
Don't act like we didn't do all that, too
You're tradin' jackets like we used to do
(Yeah, everything is all reused)
Play her piano, but she doesn't know (Oh, oh)
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel (Oh)
A different girl now, but there's nothing new

[Outro]
I know you get déjà vu
I know you get déjà vu
I know you get déjà vu

[Verse 1]
We broke up a month ago
Your friends are mine, you know I know
You've moved on, found someone new
One more girl who brings out the better in you
And I thought my heart was detached
From all the sunlight of our past
But she's so sweet, she's so pretty
Does she mean you forgot about me?

[Chorus]
Oh, I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great, but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, but don't bе happier

[Verse 2]
And do you tell her shе's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?
And promise three words you know you'll never mean
Remember when I believed
You meant it when you said it first to me?
And now I'm pickin' her apart
Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart
But she's beautiful, she looks kind
She probably gives you butterflies

[Chorus]
I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great, but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy
I wish you all the best, really
Say you love her, baby
Just not like you loved me
And think of me fondly when your hands are on her
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
I hope you're happy
Just not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, can't let you go
So find someone great, but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier

Lyrics from Live Performance

[Intro: KayCyy]
Keep my spirit alive
Keep my spirit alive, alive

[Chorus: KayCyy]
More than enough
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side
My spirit won't die, die
Oh, oh, oh, my life, yeah
Is in His hands, so I don't stress, I pray and strategize

[Verse 1: KayCyy]
New day on the rise, new me on the rise
Giving my thanks for the time and my thanks for the trials
Uh, they tryna belittle me, thinking that they killing me
This for all the centuries that we went through the misery
Uh, bounce back likе gymnast, I know I got a witness
Thank you Lord, this my day, got a better wishlist
Uh, morе space and more lane, better than it's ever been
No sight of no paparazzi than it's ever been, yeah

[Chorus: KayCyy & Kanye West]
More than enough
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side (Well, between a mix of bad schools with the fast food)
The spirit won't die, die (Bad had tools and a bad mood)
Oh, oh, my life, yeah (If you don't turn to a lil' Gotti, they gon' drain all the strength in your lil' body)
Is in His hands, so I don't stress, I pray and strategize (They turned me into a lil' Gotti, uh, yeah)
Lord have mercy

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Royce da 5'9"]
Not Wakanda but Wakanda is kinda like what we 'bout to make
And who gon' make it? Kan', duh
Who the squad? Donda
Who the mom? Donda
Who can see? Don, duh, get Don C
MIB, I told LV like Farrakhan told me
You can take the V, it still won't cure the disease (I-yeah)
Uh, still won't cure the disease, still won't cure—yeah

[Chorus: KayCyy]
More than enough
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side

[Verse 3: Kanye West & Royce da 5'9"]
You're more concerned about raising your next round than raising your next child (The spirit won’t die)
Here’s the exodus from the one you exiled
We won't panic in a pandemic, we can stand in it
Believe in the word, know the spirit is transcendent
People who stress you out, my vision clear without it (The spirit won’t die)
But it's y'all, I swear I’m sorry to hear about it
I'm not sorry it happened
I’m just sorry to hear about it
I’m either the best decision or your worst mistake
Every day’s a song, it only takes the hook to break

[Chorus: KayCyy & Kanye West]
More than enough
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side (Well, between a mix of bad schools with the fast food)
The spirit won't die, I (Bad had tools and a bad mood)
Oh, oh my life, yeah (If you don't turn to a lil' Gotti, they gon' drain all the strength in your lil' body)
Is in His hands, so I don't stress, I pray and strategize (They turned me into a lil' Gotti, uh, yeah)
Lord have mercy

It was just the other day
When we went to Joe's Cafe
Just to order up a couple steaks to eat

But we noticed something wrong
All the Worcestershire was gone
But the waitress brought a different kind of treat

She said this sauce was the chef's new creation
Guaranteed, it's a new taste sensation
But she warned us it's made out of prunes
"Try a little if you dare"
"Nothing can compare"
So we had some and now wе swear
We won't eat prunеs again

That was such a dirty trick
Boy, it really made us sick
Well it looks like we've been done in by the prune

Still the memory lingers on
I been livin' in the john
'Cause I've had the runs since Monday afternoon
I'd sell my soul for some new constipation
Need a cure for this new aggravation
Diarrhea has taken its toll
Still got the runs today
Just like yesterday
Buddy, that's why I'm hear to say
We won't eat prunes again

Won't eat prunes again
No no

Yeah

Eat the new sauce
Same as the old sauce
Lyrics from Snippet

...my waist just moves to baseline
My heart's been cold as outside
Not tryna be nobody's main aside...
Lyrics from Snippet

Living the dream, but can't sleep no more
You would do things to me
Pack you up and deny
You're now a memory
Some point I would just empathize
Is that my lunacy?
Trapped in all your lies

[Intro: Kanye West]
I can, I can, I can
I can, I can, I can
I can, I can, I can
I can, I can

[Verse 1: Vory & Kanye West]
I'm there for the kids, I'm tryin' to live for them
And I'm tryin' to change the script
Sometimes, it just can't be did
I'm dead, lifeless, untold silence
And I blame it on the system
'Cause it was never set up for us to win
Manager, you look like you need a manager
Someone that can handle 'ya
Someone of my caliber
Someone that's gon' handle all your business tryna balance 'ya

[Refrain: Vory]
Day and night, day and night, yeah
Day and night, day and night
Day and night, day and night

[Chorus: Kanye West with Vory]
Daylight, daylight
Daylight, daylight
Daylight, daylight
Daylight, daylight

[Verse 2: Vory with Kanye West & Kanye West]
Empty, please don't tempt me
They wanna еnd me with the same knifе that they tried to hand me
I can't pretend, it's "Don't do forgetting"
But you're still forgiven, oh, baby (Oh, baby)

[Refrain: Vory]
Day and night, day and night, yeah
Day and night, day and night, yeah
Day and night, day and night

[Pre-Chorus: Vory]
But if I gotta sleep alone tonight
I swear that my choice won't be right
I swear that my choice won't be right
When I'm alone I-
Too many options, too many problems
You wanna be my hero and try to solve them
But if I gotta sleep alone tonight
I promise you she just mine for the night
Who's to say that the choice will be mine?
Who's to say that my choice will be right?
Who's to say that my choice will be right?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Daylight, daylight
Daylight, daylight
Daylight, daylight
Daylight, daylight
Daylight, daylight

[Outro: Kanye West & Vory]
Most I'd have mentioned our defense
(Who's to say that the choice will be mine?)
I got seventy in the Benz
(Who's to say that my choice will be right?)
All the sun, caught the light, hold the line, golden line
I been trying, I been holding by design
I been made by the sun in the nightness
Servin', I know you're another in design (Daylight, daylight)
Y'all made me the don (Daylight, daylight)
Y'all made me 'ya own, I think do 'ya own baby (Daylight, daylight)
I've been made, be in sun, got pain in it, no (Daylight, daylight)
Go and pay for your loan, baby
I feel your pain, pain, pain, pain, pain, pain, pain
I feel your pain

[Intro: T.I.]

Listen, I never gave a fuck about them (Them)
Pretty hoes stay in my DM (DM)
I ain't never had a problem getting trim, lil' mama, your pussy ain't worth per diem
Heavyweight and I ain't gotta stay in no gym
Line 'em up and knock 'em down, bim, bim, bim
Tilt my brim, baby, I'm not him, niggas stand in line for it like at my museum
On my life me and my wife, run this city, can't snatch these stripes
We don't care what they talking 'bout fuck them lies
Just mad 'cause they bankroll ain't this size
Mask on, mask off we outside
Tell VH1, shawty, we gon' slide
Anything we can ever lose over lies people told on us then it never was ours
Think this shit a game? Nigga come try it
Put it on my chain, bet your ass get fried
All on IG, niggas wanna try me, see me in real life won't walk by me Hol' up, you ain't never seen these type, consider me a supreme being
Nigga, king skinny as string bean, at a crime scene letting it ring, ring
On the game changers seeing green things
Niggas talk tough but they don't mean things
All of my jewelry on high beam
My respect level on the high esteem
Since high school been doing my thing
Stay strapped, strike like lighting
That's why your opinion more like no opinion
Never gave a fuck about a ho opinon
You know some told me not to go up in you
Probably parallel park a Porsche in you
Gettin' tall money but I'm short-tempered
If your broke, weak, I don't fuck with you, nigga

[Chorus: T.I. & Lil Jon]
Fuck that shit they sayin'
Fuck that shit they talkin' bout (Okay, talkin' shit 'bout me, bitch, I don't give a fuck)
Hol' up, fuck that shit they sayin'
Fuck that shit they talking 'bout, nigga
Fuck that shit they sayin', fuck 'em
Fuck that shit they talkin' bout (Okay, talkin' shit 'bout me, bitch, I don't give a fuck)
Hol' up, fuck that shit they sayin'
Fuck that shit they talkin' bout, bitch

[Verse 2: T.I.]
One thang never changed to this day
That nigga Tip never did play
Ayy, listen I don't hate you if you gay
But nigga I'ma say what the fuck I wanna say
Listen, really all I care 'bout is my family and the city of Atlanta Been the shit with dealers, dancers, ain't no way for you to cancel
In my comments with that dumb shit to be honest you can vanish
And no back and forth, no batter, I'm not here for you to handle
You don't like me change the channel
On there too, suck to be you
Nigga, what I care you don't like what I do?
Nigga, I ain't tryna be nothin' like you
Nigga, I'm just livin' life, increasin' my portfolio and value
Net worth twice as much, the Midas touch with property
Damn, right we up
In my old school ways, damn right we stuck
That's a crime, gon' charge, gon' write me up
Say it in your face, I ain't tryna be suttle
I'ma speak my truth, they don't like me, fuck 'em

[Chorus: T.I. & Lil Jon]
Fuck that shit they sayin'
Fuck that shit they talkin' bout (Okay, talkin' shit 'bout me, bitch, I don't give a fuck)
Hol' up, fuck that shit they sayin'
Fuck that shit they talking 'bout, nigga
Fuck that shit they sayin', fuck 'em
Fuck that shit they talkin' bout (Okay, talkin' shit 'bout me, bitch, I don't give a fuck)
Hol' up, fuck that shit they sayin'
Fuck that shit they talkin' bout, bitch

[Outro: T.I.]
Nigga, fuck 'em
I am the magazine
The blue screen
The big hand moving past the last thing
I turn for you, turn for you
Turn for you, turn for you

I am the private room
The quiet croon
The grey eye blinking on the new moon
I burn for you, burn for you
Burn for you, burn for you

Within the last kiss
I am the genesis
While the earth rolls, bleeding from its axis
Return to you, turn to you
Turn to you, turn to you

I am the water rise
The waterfall
Filling up your eyes and when you give the call
I run for you, run for you
Run for you, run for you
Run for you, run for you
Run for you
I am the sweaty sheets
The wet bed
The things she'll do and the things she said
I'll come for you, come for you
Come for you, come for you

I am the right brain
The paper crane
The bright gold moving past the night train
A blurred view, blurred view
Blurred view, blurred view

I am the new disease
I am the new disease
The light breeze
The yellow stars glowing through the white trees
I pine for you, pine for you
Shine for you, pine for you

I am the teeth sharp
The lips read
What is unfeared and what is unfed
I'll feed for you, feed for you
Feed for you, feed for you

One step closer and I'm real
Tell me everything you feel
And I will sing for you, sing for you
Sing for you, sing for you
Sing for you
One step closer and I'm real
Tell me everything you feel
One step closer and I'm real
Tell me everything you feel
And I will sing for you, sing for you
Sing for you, sing for you
Sing for you

Don't make me count to six, give you "kitten's" timeouts and shit

Anyone who knows me at all knows that Game of Thrones is my life, so the fact that Maisie was here to present this - I wanna grab you, I can't we're social distancing, but thank you so much for coming here to do this - and that video, anyone that was in that video, Selena, Zoe, Ed, Griff! And, my soul left my body when Annie Lennox was on that video, that was like a thousand surprise birthday parties where all your friends are jumping out like "ahh!" and you're just like "this is the best!"

I wanna thank the BRITs, or anyone who decided that I would be worthy of this incredible honor. I'm really really proud to be a part of this musical community, especially in a year where we all needed music so much, but what we needed even more was the help and support we got from the NHS and the key workers who are here tonight. Thank you for everything that you've done for us.

This is a really cool one, I love this! I am so indebted to and grateful for my British fans, I love you so much for everything you've done for me. We've had so many amazing memories inn the last 15 years, from playing Shepherd's Bush Empire, to playing the O2 Arena, to playing Wembley Stadium, and hey, because of you, last year I almost played Glastonbury so. But, we all know what happened next, the world changed and I ended up putting out three albums instead.

Making folklore and evermore was one of the most unique, cathartic, extraordinary experiences I've ever had. I would love the opportunity to thank the amazing creative people that I made those albums with. Thank you Aaron Dessner, thank you Jack Antonoff, Joe, Justin Vernon, The National, Marcus Mumford, Jon Low, Serban Ghenea, Laura Sisk, and HAIM. I wanna thank my friends and family, who know exactly who they are, whose opinion of me never changed whether my stock was up or down, if there's one thing that I've learned it's that you have to look around you everyday and take note of the people who have always believed in you, and never stop appreciating them for it, never take them for granted.

There are so many incredible new artists in this room tonight, and a lot of people watching who have goals and ambitions and dreams for themselves. I need you to hear me when I say there is no career path that comes free of negativity. If you're being met with resistance, that probably means that you're doing something new. If you're experiencing turbulence or pressure, that probably means you're rising. And there might be times when you put your whole heart and soul into something and it is met with cynicism or skepticism. You cannot let that crush you, you have to let it fuel you, because we live in a world where anyone has the right to say anything that they want about you at anytime. But just please remember that you have the right to prove them wrong.

I love you all thank you so much for this beautiful honor, thank you to the BRITs! This is amazing.

*Umru said I'm cute*

[Pre-Chorus: MC Charli do XCX & umru]
And baby, you couldn't have loved me any better
But doin' this is all that I've known ever
I want the bad ones, 'cause they're all I know
I always let the good ones go

[Verse 1]
I was so full of doubt, when she sniped me out
I was down like the wounded soldier
She messed with my head, and left me for dead
And sent me a text, it was over
Now I could've stayed, but she tossed that grenade
And I ran and dove for cover
So God bless the day, you pulled me out of that grave
And showed me lovers don't have to suffer

[Chorus]
I woke up
I was down
I knew something wasn't right
I was stuck 'til you came around
Girl, you loved mе back to life

[Verse 2]
Your lips are like winе, your eyes are divine
Your scent's so intoxicating
I'm drunk on your smile, and it's been a while
Since home was a place I felt safe in
And now I'm starting to see, that some part of me
Found happiness in disaster
And now I can breathe 'cause you made me believe
There's a happily ever after (Ooh yeah)

[Chorus]
I woke up
I was down
I knew something wasn't right
I was stuck 'til you came around
Girl, you loved me back to life

[Bridge]
Girl, you loved me back to life
Girl, you loved me back to life

[Chorus]
I woke up
I was down
I knew something wasn't right
I was stuck 'til you came around
Girl, you loved me back to life
I woke up
I was down
I knew something wasn't right
I was stuck 'til you came around
Girl, you loved me back to life

[Chorus]
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this

[Verse 1]
I know He got His hands on this
I know we got a chance on this
No, I never planned on this
I might need a band on this
This might get banned off rip
Gon' say somethin' for y'all quick
Let me know something, who y'all with?
Don't know nothing, I know this

[Chorus]
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this

[Verse 2]
More than I can say for you
Before the sons and the daughters
Before the sun and the water
More than I can say for you
But the truth still for you
Once I saw what the Lord do
God, the Son, all the glory
God, the Father, like Maury
Don't care what you say, nothin' on me
I don't care 'bout the lawyer fees
I don't care 'bout your loyalties
God will solve it all for me
Trust man, he a failure
Trust, and God'll heal ya'
Dustin, he a Hoffman
Don't fall what they offerin', uh
Fall far too often, yeah, call God but don't call enough
Fall down but don't fall in love, I know God is all in us

[Chorus]
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this

[Outro]
Don't fall what they offerin', uh
Fall far too often, yeah, call God but don't call enough
Fall down but don't fall in love, I know God is all in us
Lyrics from Snippet

...we don't wanna hear from 'em right now
Right now, pipe down
She gon' fall in love when the lights out
Two cups, shared a '42
I know I said I won't but I might now
Ooh, got me feelin' some type of way
Lyrics from Instagram Live

[Intro]
Hmm-hmm, oh-woah
Hmm-hmm, oh-woah
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm

I seem lost at times
So bored, finish line
And now, can I rewind?
What happened?
You learn, you learn
Oh, hey

[?] this should be easy oh

Oh, yeah
I just pray for something better
Smoking sessions all night long
See your picture, it's 

[?], it's 

[?]
Thought the happiness was gone
'Til you met me, I said, my love
The sudden groove
Taking over me
I been praying that I see everything, I'm up
Go to sleep
All my life, all my life I want more, hey
All my life searching for more, hey
All my life, I search for more, 

[?]
All my life, I sеarch for more, ooh woah, ooh woah

[Chorus]
That would be something
Really would be something
Meet you in the falling rain
Meet you in the falling rain, darling
Meet you in the falling rain
Meet you in the falling rain
That would be something
Really would be something
Meet you in the falling rain
Meet you in the falling rain
Meet you in the falling rain, darling

[Chorus: ?]
Calling out to you (Calling out to you)
Calling out to you (Calling out to you)

[Verse 1]
Many ways to go
It's hard to self-assure
When everyone's a pro
Saying, "It's so obvious"
But really, they don't know (They don't know)
Just like a monster that is (Man or machine)
Only a shadow (A shadow)
From which I'm already runnin'

[Verse 2]
Easy, I suppose
And even if it takes
A hundred-thousand goes
The way's in front of me 'cause
That's the one I chose (I chose)
It's always starin' at you (Barely a choice)
That's the boat I row (I row)
And though it seems to be

[Chorus]
Endless problems
Relentless
I know I'm oblivious
Bit overzealous
And possibly jealous
I run till I'm breathless
Try to suppress it
I couldn't bear it, so onward, I go

[Verse 3]
Many ways to go
It's hard to self-assure
When everyone's a pro
Saying, "It's so obvious"
But really, they don't know (They don't know)
Just like the monster that is (Man or machine)
Only a shadow (A shadow)
But you're already runnin'

[Chorus]
Endless problems
Relentless
I know I'm oblivious
Bit overzealous
And possibly jealous
I run till I'm breathless
Try to suppress it
I couldn't bear it, so onward, I go

[Intro]
We're doing something special with this one, we're, um
We're actually recording you
I would love for you guys to sing as loud as you can, it would mean the world
Thank you so much for tonight, it's been absolutely bloody incredible, thank you
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a—

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Verse 1]
Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
Today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I could never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but

[Chorus]
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Verse 2]
You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go, you'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone, you know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Interlude]
That was incredible

[Bridge]
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Outro]
Oh my God
New York, thank you so, so, so, so, so much
That was a freaking dream, thank you
So incredible

[Chorus]
I'm not gullible, not quick to fall for anything
But since you've shown me your heart, shown me it all
I think I've fallen for everything about you
I'm not gullible, not quick to fall for anything
But since you've shown me your heart, shown me it all
I think I've fallen for everything about you

But since you've shown me your heart, shown me it all

[Interlude]
I think I've fallen for

[Bridge]
I know that this has only begun, but it feels likе I've always known you
So let's just start whenеver you want if you believe in what I've told you
Before we spoke, I felt so numb and now I've realised I was supposed to
So all these feelings can hit me all at once
So much emotion I have to show you
I know it's real love I have to show you

[Chorus]
I'm not gullible, not quick to fall for anything
But since you've shown me your heart, shown me it all
I think I've fallen for everything about you
I been living days like they'll never be over
As long as the sky is blue
But if I saw you side of the street, I'd pull over
Do things I thought I'd never do, do
Laying with the windows down
The seats bent back all the way down
Saturday, drive through sunset, music loud
I'm okay
Yeah, I'm happy, I don't need someone
I'm happy, I don't need your love
I'm happy, but I want you
Yeah, I'm happy, I don't need someone
I'm happy but I want you
I'm always stuck on the inside
Winter or the summer days
But you look so good in my sunshine
Now I can never look away
Laying with the windows down
The seats bent back all the way down
Saturday, drive through sunset, music loud
I'm okay
Yeah, I'm happy, I don't need someone
I'm happy, I don't need your love
I'm happy, but I want you
Yeah, I'm happy, I don't need someone
I'm happy but I want you
Laying with the windows down
The seats bent back all the way down
Saturday, drive through sunset, music loud
I'm okay
Yeah, I'm happy, I don't
Need someone
I'm happy, I don't need your love
I'm happy, but I want you
Yeah, I'm happy, I don't need someone
I'm happy but I want you
Run away, run, run, we run away
(I'm happy, I don't need your love)
Run away, run, run, run away
(I'm happy, but I want you)
Run away, run, run, run away
(I'm happy, I don't need someone)
Run away, yeah
(I'm happy, I don't)
Unusual, we got mutual friends
Is it mutual if I kiss your lips?
If I'm truthful, then it all depends on your feelings
Crucial, how I'm leanin' in
'Cause I'm used to just divin' in
I could lose you, that's the consequence of my feelings


Is there a spark for us
Or is it just purely platonic?
Is this a story arc?
'Cause if it are, it'd be iconic
I wasn't gonna ask
Afraid of asking you to dance
(But here I am)


Falling for a friend
Falling for a friend, ooh
Baby, don't pretend
That you don't feel it too
I know you do
I wonder if we cross the line
Go under covers, close the blind
Will we be lovers or cut the ties forever?

Is therе a spark for us
Or is it just purely platonic?
Is this a story arc?
'Cause if it are, it'd bе iconic
I wasn't gonna ask
Afraid of asking you to dance
(But here I am)


Falling for a friend
Falling for a friend, ooh
Baby, don't pretend
That you don't feel it too
I know you do

Oh, baby, here I am
I'm falling for a friend, ooh
Come on, don't pretend (don't pretend that)
That you don't feel it too
I know you do
Is there a spark for us
Or is it just purely platonic?
Is this a story arc?
'Cause if it are, it'd be iconic
I've been pacin' around
Waiting it out for just one chance
(So here I am)
Falling for a friend
Falling for a friend, ooh
Baby, don't pretend
That you don't feel it too
I know you do
Oh, baby, here I am
I'm falling for a friend, ooh
Come on, don't pretend (don't pretend that)
That you don't feel it too
I know you do

[Verse 1]
Exit on a whim
Hopefully, we find it again
I'm tired of turning back
Let's keep on moving down the track
And if the horse lies down
There's a push just a mile uptown
If the horse lies down

[Chorus]
Wake me up to drive, wake me up to drive
Even if I'm tired, I don't wanna miss a ride
Wake me up to drive, wake me up to drive
Even if I'm tired, I don't wanna miss a ride

[Verse 2]
Hand upon my skin
Warm me up and calm me down
I like to watch your chin
Tracing the familiar sound
Of a famous song
Put one on, let's sing along
To the famous song

[Chorus]
Wake me up to drive, wakе me up to drive
Even if I'm tirеd, I don't wanna miss a ride
Wake me up to drive, wake me up to drive
Even if I'm tired, I don't wanna miss a ride

[Verse 3]
Vacancies, none
The same ideas from everyone
We never plan ahead
We take the gamble on instead
And if they turn us down
Find a warm bed in the next town
If they turn us down

[Chorus]
Wake me up to drive, wake me up to drive
Even if I'm tired, I don't wanna miss a ride
Wake me up to drive, wake me up to drive
Even if I'm tired, I don't wanna miss a ride
Wake me up to drive, wake me up to drive
Even if I'm tired, I don't wanna miss a ride
Wake me up to drive, wake me up to drive
Even if I'm tired, I don't wanna miss a ride

Amazing grace, it saves
Oh, how sweet the sound

Oh, how sweet the sound
Amazing grace, it saves (Amazing grace, it saves)
Oh, how sweet the sounds (Oh, how sweet the sounds)

All of us get to the riches, my bitches in love with each other, it's perfect (Mwah)
Twenty percent of my soul I had gave to the devil, but fuck it, it's worth it
Told her to give me that top, get a purchase
Niggas is clowns, livin' in circus
I'm goin' up, up off Perkies
I'm off

She want steak, she get Churches
She pack diamonds, shit look worthless
And I'm pimpin', this my purpose
Pay one fifty for my sеrvice (Yeah)
M-O-L-L-Y in my veins, I cannot focus (Damn, damn, yеah)
I-T-S-U-S, it's only us, I thought you noticed (It's us)
If I brought my Glock, we're in a hell whip, I ain't gon' show up
Pull up with a .50 totin' thirty when I was twenty (Who?)
I spent a hunnid, pussy, never overlook me (Never)
I know killers who don't get off Triller, life a real thriller
Don't go gamblin' with your life then get mad at the card dealer
Swear they call

Whole real pill popper, I'm a real back breaker (Slatt)

[Verse 1: BIA]
Uh, livin' vida loca, puentes in mi boca
I just spent a hundred fifty thousand on a choker
Seen his new girl and I had to keep it poker
I know she don't got a bag and that is very mediocre
I'm like, "If you knew better, you would do better"
I like Prada for the shoes, just so I can move better
Only time I do the Loubs is to match the coupe leather
If you find me in the mood, we could catch some new weather
I'm in Italian sеats, marble floors
I got mine, but I like that I been spеnding yours, oop
That's my door, I'm no rookie
Call me old school, I like you droppin' checks on that pussy

[Chorus: T-Pain]
(Boop-boop, ooh)
She don't want the drink, she want the rent paid (Ooh)
She don't pay for nothing, she just get paid (Ah)
I like dat, she don't even need me to try (Ooh)
She pull up in the 'Rari with the roof up (Ooh)
I'm just buying drank, she doin' too much
I like dat, she don't even need me to buy her nothin'

[Post-Chorus: T-Pain]
(Drank) She got money in the (Bank)
What you think 'bout that?
She know she fly, she stuntin' (Ooh)
She gon' buss it (Ooh)
What you think 'bout that?

[Verse 2: T-Pain]

Laughin' bout how small it looks on you

I love you

Do you get deja vu (Ah)

[Verse 1]
Feels like I'm not where I'm supposed to be
I don't fit in with these familiar faces
And the games they play don't mean a thing to me
I know there's so much more

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I can't stop dreamin', and thinkin'
Maybe I could be someone different
More than a yearbook memory
If I leave this, I'm riskin' almost everything
Am I on the right road?

[Chorus]
Outta the old, I've gotta find my way
Into the new, give anything it takes
I wanna know, if no one knew my name
Would my wildest dreams feel like home?
If I go out of the old (Ayo, ayo)
And into the new (Ayo, ayo)
Out of the old (Ayo, ayo)
And into the new (Ayo, ayo)
Yeah, I wanna know (Ayo, ayo)
If no one knew my name
Would my wildest dreams feel like home?
Out of the old

[Verse 2]
I wish these streets were still enough for me
I wish this town could give me everything
But I still feel stopped while every light turns green
Why can't I let it go?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I can't stop dreamin', and thinkin'
Maybe I could be someone different
More than a yearbook memory
Leavin' all this, I'm riskin' almost everything
But there's only one road

[Chorus]
Outta the old, I've gotta find my way
Into the new, give anything it takes
I wanna know, if no one knew my name
Would my wildest dreams feel like home?
If I go out of the old (Ayo, ayo)
And into the new (Ayo, ayo)
Out of the old (Ayo, ayo)
And into the new (Ayo, ayo)
Yeah, I wanna know (Ayo, ayo)
If no one knew my name
Would my wildest dreams feel like home? (Ayo, ayo)
Out of the old (Ayo, ayo)

[Outro]
And into the new (Ayo, ayo)
Take me out of the old (Ayo, ayo)
And into the new (Ayo, ayo)
'Cause I wanna go
I wanna go
Mmm
Just take me
Picking her apart
Like cutting her down will make you miss my wretched heart
But she's beautiful
She looks kind
She probably gives you butterflies

I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know
I can't let you go
So find someone great, but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier

[Verse 1]
Always knew you even when I didn't
Know you, don’t make sense, but it do
I was on my way to you
Every teardrop fell so heavy
Hurt like hell but Heaven sent me through
I was on my way to you

[Chorus]
And every heartbreak was a yellow brick road
Pointing me straight, just taking me home
I was never lost, I was just passing through
I was on my way to you

[Verse 2]
Hope was hopeless, faith was running
Didn't notice you were coming through
You were on your way too
And you don't believe in meant-to-be
But somehow you were meant for me, it's true
Yeah, you were on your way too

[Chorus]
And every heartbreak was a yellow brick road
Pointing me straight, just taking me home
I was never lost, I was just passing through
I was on my way to you
I was on my way to you
I was on my way to you
I was on my way to you, oh

[Chorus 2]
On my way
On my way to you
On my way
On my way to you
On my way
On my way to you, oh
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
On my way
On my way
I'm on my way
On my way to you, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
And every heartbreak was a yellow brick road
Pointing me straight, just taking me home
I was never lost, I was just passing through
On my way to you
(On my way, on my way, on my way, on my way to you)

[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(On my way, on my way, on my way, on my way to you)
On my way to you
On my, darling, I'm on my way
Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bob tails ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to laugh and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
We got into a drifted bank
And then we got upset
Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh yeah

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
I see trees of green, red roses, too
I see them bloom, for me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

I see skies of blue, and clouds of white
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people going by
I see friends shaking hands, sayin', "How do you do?"
They're really sayin', "I love you"

I hear babies cryin'. I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Said the night wind to the little lamb
Do you see what I see
Way up in the sky little lamb
Do you see what I see
A star, a star
Dancing in the night
With a tail as big as a kite
With a tail as big as a kite

Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear
(Do You Hear What I Hear)
Ringing through the sky shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear
(Do hear What i hear)
A song, a song
High above the trees
With a voice as big as the sea
With a voice as big as the sea

Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king
Do you know what I know
(Do You Know What I Know)
In your palace wall mighty king
Do you know what I know
(Do You Know What I Know)
A child, a child
Shivers in the cold
Let us bring him silver and gold
Let us bring him silver and gold

Said the king to the people everywhere
Listen to what I say
(Listen to what I say)
Pray for peace people everywhere
Listen to what I say
(Listen to what I Say)
The child, the child
Sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light
He will bring us goodness and light
He will bring us goodness and light
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Moments so dear
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes
How do you measure-measure a year

In daylights- in sunsets
In midnights- in cups of coffee
In inches- in miles
In laughter- in strife

Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes
How do you measure a year in the life

How about love
How about love
How about love
Measure in love
Seasons of love
Seasons of love
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Journeys to plan
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Six hundred minutes
How do you measure the life
Of a woman or a man

In truth that she learns
Or in times that he cried
In bridges he burned
Or the way that she dies

Its time now to sing out
Though the story never ends
Lets celebrate
Remember a year in the life of friends

Remember the love
Remember the love
Remember the love
Measure in love
Seasons of love
Seasons of love
Well-now just because you think your so pretty
Just because you think your so hot
Just because you think you've got something
That nobody else has got

Though you make me spend all my money
You laugh and call me old Santa Claus
Well, I'm telling you honey
I'm through with you
Because, just because

Well-now just because you think I'm so lonesome
Just because I'll be blue
Just because you think
I'd be foolish to stay around at home and wait for you

Though you made me drop all my boyfriends
You laugh and call me old Santa Cause
Well, I'm telling you honey
I'm through with you
Because, just because
Though you make me spend all my money
You laugh and call me old Santa Clause
But, I'm telling you that
I'm through with you
Because, just because
Choices that we make in life
May take us far
Chances that we take tonight
May lead us into darken places
But at the end of Godly choices
Are higher dreams
But in the game of chance
Theres only a guilty wave or stream
Sometimes I don't know which road I should take
Sometimes I don't know which move I should make

But it's only if God says yes
I'll make my move
And it's only if God says yes
Then I will choose
For it's only if God would just
Bow his head
Then I will do it
Thats what I will do

I started down the right road
Only to end up wrong
The endless journey carried me so far away
From my home and family
But I'm learning I was never meant to go alone
Neither was it meant for me to go on my own no
Sometimes I don't know which road I should take
Sometimes I don't know which move I should make
I'll never go on my own
I'll never go all alone
Sometimes I don't know which road I should take
Sometimes I don't know which move I should make

But it's only if God says yes
I'll make my move
For it's only if God says yes
Then I will choose
For it's only if God would just answer me
And it's only if God would just hear my plead
And it's only if God would just bow his head
Then I will do it
That's what I will do
That's what I will do

[Verse 1: Max Elto]
This is the end station
But I can't move away from you
This is the edge of patience
But you won't prove yourself to me
Still you drain my soul and

[Chorus: Max Elto]
Even though it hurts, I can't slow down
Walls are closing in and I hit the ground
Whispers of tomorrow echo in my mind
Just one last time
Even though it hurts, I can't slow down
Walls are closing in and I hit the ground
Whispers of tomorrow echo in my mind
Just one last time
Just one last time

[Chorus: Max Elto]
Even though it hurts, I can't slow down
Walls are closing in and I hit the ground
Whispers of tomorrow echo in my mind
Just one last time
Even though it hurts, I can't slow down
Walls are closing in and I hit the ground
Whispers of tomorrow echo in my mind
Just one last time
Just one last timе
Just one last time

I know there are times in your life
When the wheels just seem to turn
And uncertainties about your tomorrow seem, to grow
I think you should remember and you should always know
That out of everyone who loves you, I love you the most

Visions that can change the world
Trapped inside an ordinary girl
She looks just like me
To afraid to dream out loud

And though it's set for your idea
It won't make sense to everybody
You need courage now
If you're going to persevere

To fulfill your divine purpose
You've gotta answer when you're called

Against all odds

Keep the dream alive don't let it die
If something deep inside
Keeps inspiring you to try, don't stop
And never give up; don't ever give up on you
Don't give up
Every victory comes in time
Work today to change tomorrow
It gets easier
Who's to say that you can't fly?

Every step you take you gets
Closer to your destination
You can feel it now
Don't you know you're almost there?

To fulfill your life's purpose
You've gotta' answer when you're called
So don't be afraid to face the world
Against all odds

Keep the dream alive don't let it die
If something deep inside
Keeps inspiring you to try, don't stop
And never give up; don't ever give up on you

Sometimes life can place a stubborn block in your way
But you've gotta keep the faith
Reap what deep inside your heart
To fly

And never give up
Don't ever give up on you
Don't give up

The answer that can solve the mystery
The key that can unlock your understanding

If something deep inside keeps inspiring you to try

Time
What you gonna do with yours
Why do you need some more?
What ya gonna do with your time?
Seems like its infinite, but it really isn't
We have a small about a time

Folks depend on you, do what you got do
But never ever waste your time
Yes its time to take place
What ya gonna do today
What you gonna do with your time?

I thought about it a few years back
Qhat if we never got off track?
And if we never got distracted
Who would be further or still be passing?
Thought the love walks, the love mandate
Would we listen, what we participate?

When we decide that we must do
Everything that we were born to do cause
Everyone has a plan, destiny
Everyone that includes you & me
Everyone has a plan, destiny
Everyone that includes you & me

So in this season, will you waste your time?
In this season, will ya make up your mind
To move forward in & move ahead?
Enough wasting time, get in, don't waste your time

Time
What you gonna do with yours
Why do you need some more?
Don't waste your time
Seems like its infinite, but it really isn't
What haven't your time?

Folks depend on you, do what you got do
But never ever waste your time
Yes its time to take your place
What ya gonna do today
What you gonna do with your time?

So the path we must take muscly to love instead of hate
Must lead the Truth instead of lies
All accepted, none despised
Because of color, race or creed
We are His children & we must believe
The pressure's time is ticking away
Why we waste greatness every time?

What you gonna do with yours
Why do you need some more?
What ya gonna do with your time?
Seems like its infinite, but it really isn't
We have a small about a time

To everything there is a season
To everything there is a purpose
What will your life say, will you stray away
Will your words delight you & your words fight you?

Time is running out
Remember you're a child of God

Unashamed because of mercy
I'm overwhelmed, I'm overwhelmed by You

You are Beautiful, You are Beautiful

I'm overwhelmed, I'm overwhelmed by You
There is no one more Beautiful
You are the most Beautiful

[Chorus: Kristoffer Fogelmark]
Working my money ‘til I get gold
Monday-Friday mornin'
Working my money ‘til I get gold
Cause I can't get enough
Working my money ‘til I get gold
Monday-Friday mornin'
Working my money ‘til I get gold
Cause I can't get enough

[Verse 1: Earl St. Clair]
Started out with nothing and I still got most of that
The world ain't give me much, I'm positive that's a fact
Everybody said be cool, you be payin' your dues
Make a long story short, I got nothin' to lose

[Pre-Chorus: Earl St. Clair]
When I get it, I ain't ever goin' back again
When I get it, I ain't ever goin' back again
100 percent, yeah, pure grindin'
When I get it, I ain't ever goin' back again
When I get it, I ain't ever goin' back again
100 percent, yeah, pure grindin'
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2: Earl St. Clair]
Try to make a dollar out of 15 cents
But I ain't understand how the money was spent
My mama told me, "Boy you ain't got no sense
If we put it all together can we pay this rent?"
I've been some places
Places I never should've been
I caught some changes
Changes that made me who I am

[Pre-Chorus: Earl St. Clair]
When I get it, I ain't ever goin' back again
When I get it, I ain't ever goin' back again

[Verse 1]
I bless the day I found you
I want my arms around you
And so I beg you: let it be me

[Verse 2]
Don't take this heaven from one
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever, let it be me

[Verse 3]
Each time we meet, love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love, what would life be?

[Verse 4]
So never leave me lonely
Tell me that you love me only
And say you'll always let it be me
Señor, señor, do you know where we’re headin’?
Lincoln County Road or Armageddon?
Seems like I been down this way before
Is there any truth in that, señor?

Señor, señor, do you know where she is hidin’?
How long are we gonna be ridin’?
How long must I keep my eyes glued to the door?
Will there be any comfort there, señor?

There’s a wicked wind still blowin’ on that upper deck
There’s an iron cross still hangin' down from around her neck
Therе’s a marchin’ band still playin’ in that vacant lot
Where she hеld me in her arms one time and said, “Forget me not”

Señor, señor, I can see that painted wagon
I can smell the tail of the dragon
Can’t stand the suspense anymore
Can you tell me who to contact here, señor?

Well, the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
Was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field
A gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring
Said, “Son, this ain’t a dream no more, it’s the real thing”
Señor, señor, you know their hearts is as hard as leather
Well, give me a minute, let me get it together
I just gotta pick myself up off the floor
I’m ready when you are, señor

Señor, señor, let’s disconnect these cables
Overturn these tables
This place don’t make sense to me no more
Can you tell me what we’re waiting for, señor?
Ramona, come closer
Shut softly your watery eyes
The pangs of your sadness
Will pass as your senses will rise

The flowers of the city
Though breath-like, get deathlike at times
And there's no use in tryin'
To deal with the dyin'
Though I cannot explain that in lines

Your cracked country lips
I still wish to kiss
As to be by the touch of your skin
Your magnetic movements still capture the minutes I'm in

But it's grieving my heart, love
To see you tryin' to be a part of
A world that just don't exist
It's all just a scheme, babe
A vacuum, a dream, babe
That sucks you into feelin' like this
I've heard you say many times
That you're better than no one
And no one is better than you
If you really believe that
You know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose

From fixtures and forces and friends your sorrow does stem
That hype you
And type you
And making you feel that you gotta be just like them

I'd forever talk to you
But soon my words would turn into a meaningless ring
For deep in my heart
I know there's no help I can bring

Everything passes
Everything changes
Do what you think you should do
And someday, maybe
Who knows, baby
I'll come and be cryin' to you

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah, they were all yellow
I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called "Yellow"
So then I took my turn
Oh, what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow

[Chorus 1: Chris Martin]
Your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
You know, you know I love you so
You know I love you so

[Verse 2: Shawn Mendes, Camila Cabello]
I swam across
I jumped across for you
Oh, what a thing to do
'Cause you were all yellow
I drew a line
I drew a line for you
Oh, what a thing to do
And it was all yellow

[Chorus 2: All]
Your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
And you know
For you, I'd bleed myself dry
For you, I'd bleed myself dry

[Bridge: All]
It's true, look how thеy shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how thеy shine for
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine

[Outro: Shawn Mendes & Camila Cabello]
Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And all the things that you do

Yeah, I like how you move (Move)
I love me some bae, I had to choose (I had to choose)
I wanna worship your body and show you that you got a throne (I need some baby)
She like a bill collector the way that she callin' my phone (Callin' my phone)
Love me bae, love me some weight
You ain't in line, I gotta skate
I want that cash, give me a break
She lock me down, but she ain't a jake
Is it for real or what the hell?
I had to weight it all like a scale
Is it a spell? Can't really tell
You look so well in your Chanel (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug]
I think what you tryin', I think what you tryin', I think what you tryna do (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
I could never build the ether or the grass overgrown
I could never build the river with a mouth full of foam
I could never build the winter with her cold tears of glitter
I've been listening to the red oak and the acorn she cries
Been listening to the white birch and the paper she dries
I've been listening to the frogs joke, listening to the fire smoke

[Chorus]
I can never tеll you now what I had often said before
Bеcause promise is a pendulum just swinging at the door
And I'm not saying I'm not jealous or scared anymore
I'm just saying

[Verse 2]
I could never build a rainbow or any kind of flower
I could never make a sparrow or a meteor shower
I could never build an earthworm, never make the earth turn
I've been listening to the laughing of the fox down the trail
I've been clasping to the listening of the moss to the snail
Ooh
The shimmer of the beech leaves as the wind does a big sneeze

[Chorus]
I could never tell you now what I had often said before
Because promise is a pendulum just swinging at the door
And I'm not saying I'm not jealous or scared anymore
I'm just saying

[Verse 3]
I could never build the shadow between your cheek and your eye
I could never make a freckle or the warm breath you sigh
The canopy of lashes with the softness of ashes
I've been listening to the memory, the way that it was
Listening to the echo of whys and because
Listening to the echo telling me to let go

[Chorus]
I could never tell you now what I had often said before
Because promise is a pendulum just hanging at the door
And I'm not saying I'm not jealous or scared anymore
I'm just saying
Saying

[Verse 1]
Do you remember how we lit up the room?
And how you felt before you met all my different moods?
But now I drive you mad when I hit you with the truth
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't let your mind think it's someone else, someone else
I need to do something for myself, oh

[Chorus]
Don't wait up
Don't wait up, up, up, up, up
Don't wait up
Don't wait up, up, up, up, up
Don't be afraid if it gets late, yeah
You'll survive, it's just one night
Don't wait up
Don't wait up, up, up, up, up, up, up

[Verse 2]
Why won't you put down your phone and look me in the eye?
Got all dressed up for you, but you seem so occupied
Maybe space is all it takes, it's time to fix us

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't let your mind think it's someone else, someone else
I need to do something for myself, oh

[Chorus]
Don't wait up
Don't wait up, up, up, up, up
Don't wait up
Don't wait up, up, up, up, up
Don't be afraid if it gets late, yeah
You'll survive, it's just one night
Don't wait up
Don't wait up, up, up, up, up, up, up, ah

[Bridge]
First I kissed you
Then I got mad at you
'Cause I wish I'd
Be happy without you
If I ditch you
Then maybe you would understand
Then maybe you would understand

[Pre-Chorus]
I need to do something for myself, oh

[Chorus]
Don't wait up
Don't wait up, up, up, up, up
Don't wait up
Don't wait up, up, up, up, up
Don't be afraid if it gets late, yeah
You'll survive, it's just one night
Don't wait up
Don't wait up, up, up, up, up, up, up, ah

[Intro]
My soul cries out Hallelujah and I thank God for saving me
I thank God for—

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Here go all your problems again (I thank God)
Three, two, one, you're pinned (I thank God)
Uncle now he back in the pen' (Hallelujah)
Auntie shut down again
Did she finally come to life? (Thank you, Jesus)
Ever wish you had another life?
Ever wish you had another life?
Ever wish you had another life?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Don't you wish the night would go numb?
I've been feelin' low for so long
I ain't had a high in so long
I been in the dark for so long
Night is always darkest 'fore the dawn
Gotta make my mark 'fore I'm gone
I don't wanna die alone
I don't wanna die alone
I get mad when she gone
Mad when she home
Sad when she gone
Mad when she home
Sad when she gone (Loosen right now, the spirit that wants to run)
Floatin' on a silver lining (In the name of Jesus)
Yeah, you know where to find me, ridin' on a silver lining
And my God won't deny me, tell the Devil, "Get behind me"
And all the stars are aligned, lift me up every time
You know exactly where to find me

[Interlude]
Hallelujah (Thank you, Jesus)
Hallelujah (Yes)
Hallelujah

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West  with Tyler, The Creator]
Did those ideas ever really come to life?
Make it all come to life
Make it all come to life
Prayin' for a change in your life
Well, maybe it's gon' come tonight

[Chorus: Kanye West with Tyler, The Creator]
Sadness settin' in again
Three, two, one, you're pinned
Uncle right back in the pen'
Tell me how auntie been
Took your thoughts and penciled 'em in
Should've wrote 'em down in pen
And maybe they'll come to life
And maybe they'll come to life
Sadness settin' in again
Three, two, one, you're pinned
Uncle right back to the pen'
Tell me how auntie been
Thoughts, you had penciled 'em in
Probably should've wrote 'em in pen
And maybe they'll come to life
They could finally come to life
They could finally come to life

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
You know where to find me, they cannot define me
So they crucify me, how so fazed when I leave?
Come and purify me, come and sanctify me
You the air that I breathe, the ultra-ultralight beam
Brought a gift to Northie, all she want was Nikes
This is not about me, God is still alive, so I'm free
Floatin' on a silver lining, floatin' on a silver lining
So when I'm free, I'm free

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Killed the game, took home the obituary

Two pistols on me, so security isn’t necessary

Business meeting, pull up in a Bentley Coupe convertable
You the shit? Shit I ain't ever heard of you

[Intro: Kanye West & Dem Jointz]
Did it for the likes, for the sake of the hype
For the sake of the sights
I ain’t scared, no yikes
Hold the sunk in my ice
Hold the show, hold my ice
For the sake of the hype
For the sake of the price

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Dem Jointz]
Gonna read your rights
For the sake of the hype
Hold up, hold me some ice
I hold like the pol-ice
Po-po, read me my rights
Read me nothin’, good night
It’s just one of those nights
It’s just one of those nights
It’s just onе of those nights
For the sake of thе hype
I put that on my life
Roll a chance from the dice
Pop a wheelie, then bikes
Get to a whole ‘nother height
I mean really no hype
Man, it’s really no hype
Man, it’s really no hype
I’m on a whole ‘nother plight
You can see in my eyes
I am not actin’ nice
I don’t take your advice
All my niggas is sheisty, for the sake of the hype
All my niggas is sheisty, for the sake of the hype
It’s just one of those nights
It be one of those nights, it be one of those-
We be takin’ off
In Jamaican clubs where they makin' love
Party, party flow
She was winding up, elevating us
She was vapin’ up for the sake of the hype

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Hype, hype, hype, hype
Hype, hype, hype, hype

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Dem Jointz]
Thousand on ten, blow dope moving in
Than we-than we fell on in
"Can he do it one more again?"
Let in her friends, I gotta feel-
Blood thirsty for revenge, every time it’s an event
Whenever I vent, I put a hundred percent and-
Can he do it again? Sake of the hype

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Hype, hype, hype, hype
Hype, hype, hype, hype

Watch you move on without mе

[Chorus: Young Thug]
You want a real nigga, I'm just one of those (On God)

Ooh, ooh

Keep my spirit alive, alive

[Chorus: KayCyy]
More than enough
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side
The spirit won't die, die
Oh, oh, my life, yeah
Is in His hands, so I don't stress, I pray and strategize

[Verse 1: Westside Gunn]
Yo
Flushed the work just in time and they raided, thank God (Thank God)
Screamin' through the GT roof like ****, we done made it, thank God (Thank God)
Hundred-round drum didn't jam when my shooter tried to spray it, thank God (Thank God)
Couple thousand grams, got two thousand grands when we waited, thank God (Thank God)
I was facin' fifteen and I beat it (And I beat it)
Just spent about twenty up at Neimans (Up at Neimans)
Did two hundred in a Dеmon (In a Demon, skrrt)
I'm the illest **** and I mеan it (And I mean it)
My homie droppin' bodies for no reason (Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)
Now his kids see him on the weekends (Ah)
Got the baking soda for the remix (Remix)
Millionaires on, I can see it

[Chorus: KayCyy]
More than enough
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side
The spirit won't die, die
Oh, oh, my life, yeah
Is in His hands, so I don't stress, I pray and strategize

[Verse 2: Conway the Machine]
Yeah, don't hate me, 'cause my heart is full of love
No weapon formed against me 'cause I'm covered in the blood
Layin' in the hospital when I got shot, fam
Mama prayed for me, said she left it in God's hands, yeah
So I'ma leave it in God's hands
Everything I'm doin' now is God's plan
Doctor said I wouldn't walk no more, now I stand
Then I ran, here I am, Machine

[Chorus: KayCyy]
Keep my spirit alive
More than enough
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side

[Verse 3: Kanye West & Royce da 5'9"]
Well, between a mix of bad schools with the fast food
Bad had tools and a bad mood
If you don't turn to a lil' Gotti, they gon' drain all the strength in your lil' body
They turned me into a lil' Gotti, uh, yeah
Not Wakanda but Wakanda is kinda like what we 'bout to make
And who gon' make it? Kan', duh
Who the squad? Donda
Who the mom? Donda
Who can see? Don, duh, get Don C
Who needs practice? I don't do rehearsals
And I don't do commercials, 'cause they too commercial
Give it all to God and let Jesus reimburse you
She said "You in the studio with who? I'ma hurt you"
How I'm forty-two and you got a curfew?
How nerves dictate how they gon' curve you?
Quiet all the cordialness
We walk in God's spiritual ordinance
We know the Blacks, the orphans refused to be runaways
Rebel, renegade, must stay paid

[Chorus: KayCyy]
More than enough
You can take it all, but the Lord on my side
The spirit won't die, die
Oh, oh, my life, yeah
Is in His hands, so I don't stress, I pray and strategize

[Verse 1: Luna Li]
You don't know me, you lied
And you're taking all my time
I'm just tryna' do what's right
Only tryna' do what's right
Thoughts are loud in the night
So I imagine
Taking flight

[Chorus: Luna Li]
You said you'd be my love and you
Said you'd be my flower
But the sun will never shine on a
Garden grown for power
You said you'd build my trust but you
Didn't even bother
And you planted all these roots
Just to sit and watch them wither

[Verse 2: Luna Li]
You don't own me, but you tried
And you strengthened all your ties
When I ascended to the sky
It looked like you could finally fly
When I think about all the things that I can do
I know I will go on further without you
'Cause I'm in touch with my heart and body too
Adjust my feelings

[Verse 3: Dreamer Isioma]
Adjust my feelings to you
I don't got nothing to prove
All you've proved to me is you are not my twin flame
I may be mentally unstable but you're insane
What's the point of planting flowers when there's no rain
Every second, every hour feels the same
What's the point of meeting up if there's no spark
You're wasting time playing games
I miss making love, making art

[Chorus: Luna Li]
You said you'd be my love and you
Said you'd be my flower
But the sun will never shine on a
Garden grown for power
You said you'd build my trust but you
Didn't even bother
And you planted all these roots
Just to sit and watch them wither

[Outro]
You don't know me
I would never ask you to stay
I should've known this is fate
(You don't) Know me
I would never ask you to stay
I set my heart on a plate
You should've known it's too late
You don't know me
I would never ask you to stay
I should've known this is fate
On my very first date
You don't know me
I would never ask you to stay
I set my heart on a plate
You should've known it's too late
(You don't)

For I see something bad

I see a hole in the ground

But there's no-one around
But the sheets on the street
But I'm quick on my feet
And I'm running to you
Just a-looking above me
Just a-looking above me

There's a hole in the ground
There's a hole in the ground
But there's no-one around
But the sheets on the street
And I'm quick on my feet
And I'm running to you
Just a-looking abovе me

[Intro: Kanye West with Stalone & Donda West]
Please Welcome Dr. Donda West
Forever, ever
Can you hear me? Yeah
Forever, ever
Forever, forever, no
Glorious, glory, glory, glory
Glory, glory, glory, glory

[Spoken Verse: Donda West, Kanye West, Kanye West & Stalone]
It feels good to be home
And to all of you, I thank you so much for your support
For your support of me for so many years
And more importantly, for the work you continue to do
What did he want me to talk about?
Well, he said something that was a little bit dangerous
He told me I could talk about anything I wanted to
And you know, I am my son's mother
The man I described in the introduction is bеing so decidedly differеnt, my son (When you're runnin' outta time and you're not outta time)
And what made the project extra special to me is
I got a chance to share not only what he has meant to me
But what he has meant to a generation (Chase the time)
As one writer said, we came from somewhere
Not just from the wombs of our mothers and the seeds of our fathers
But from a long line of generations who came before us

[Chorus: The World Famous Tony Williams & Sunday Service Choir]
Is the kingdom (Is the kingdom)
And the power (And the power)
And the glory (And the glory)
Forever? (Forever)
Is the kingdom (Is the kingdom)
And the power (And the power)
And the glory (And the glory)
Forever? (Forever)

[Bridge: Kanye West with Stalone & Donda West]
Forever, yeah
Forever, yeah
Forever, forever, no, oh, yeah
Glorious, glory, glory, glory
What did I teach him? (Glory)
And why Kanye ain't scared?

[Verse: Kanye West & Pusha T]
I'd rather deal with the shame than take the weight of the lie
Every time we talk I just wait for the lies
Every time I get the food, I just wait for the flies
Send my prayers up, im just waitin' on the skies
My, my, my, Miss American Pie
Was a hero after Katrina but that levee went dry
Mom met my dad back in '75
Two years later, the chosen has arrived
Holy, Holy, Holy Father
Hold me in an ocean worth of Holy Water
When the world built on lies, the truth is a threat
Faith over the fortune, it got me outta debt
Theres snakes in money pits that I ain't found yet
Crooks behind the scene like, "He ain't drown yet?"
Rain bills from the ranch 'til the whole town wet
God's grace rains down, that's the holy fountain
Got twelve thousand acres full of holy mountains
See, I almost didn't make it, who am I without Him?
Holy, Holy, Holy Father, hold me in a ocean the size of Holy Water
Man, if plan A worked, i wouldn't know my daughter
Man, every tear i cried in South Carolina

[Chorus: The World Famous Tony Williams & Sunday Service Choir]
Is the kingdom (Is the kingdom)
And the power (And the power)
And the glory (And the glory)
Forever? (Forever)
Is the kingdom (Is the kingdom)
And the power (And the power)
And the glory (And the glory)
Forever? (Forever)

[Intro: Kanye West, Kanye West & Dem Jointz & Dem Jointz]
If I hit you with a "W-Y-D?"
You better not hit me with a "H-E-Y"
It better be like "Hi" with a bunch of I's
Or "Hey" with a bunch of Y's
I, I lived a hundred lives, uh
So that mean I had a hundred wives
And I am just simply high off life for the hundredth time

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Dem Jointz]
Sharper than the sword, wanna do me in
Was it somethin' I said? Well, it usually is
Conscience of subs, I call that subconscious
When a brawl was just bein' unpacked
And the daddy problems was just bein' unpacked in it
We grew up in this algorithm track
So if it's one for love, I need to get the one back

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
Most insane out of body experience
And I repent for everything I'ma do again (I accept Him)
And I repent for everything I'ma do again

[Chorus: Kanye West & Dem Jointz]
Thank You, thank You, thank You for Your mercy
Make me new
Make me new again

I repent for everything that I'ma do again
Make me new again
Make me new again
Make me new again
Last night don't count
This mornin' don't count

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
If you take the ride, please don't close your eyes, uh
In a den of thieves, every man disguise, uh
Keep your mask on, keep it sanitized, uh
It's a rollercoaster, keep your hands inside, uh
Speakin' on Your name, 'member this advice, uh
What they vandalize, He'll evangelize, uh
He gon' part the tides, He gon' part the skies, uh
Wanna bring you shame? 'Member this advice, uh
What they vandalize, He'll evangelize, uh
He gon' part the tides, He gon' part the skies, huh
Wanna bring you pain? 'Member this advice, uh
What they vandalize, He'll evangelize, uh
He gon' part the tides, He gon' part the skies, uh
Did it for the fame, 'member this advice, huh
What they vandalize, He'll evangelize, uh

[Verse: Kanye West]
Back again, I used my back against the wall
Never called on y'all, never count on y'all
I'll always count on God
Back again, I used my back against the wall
Never called on y'all, never count on y'all

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Now we've been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
He lives in a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Sittin' by myself, I'm just thinkin'
About all I've been through, I wish I was dreamin'
Man, it's hard to be an angel when you surrounded by demons (Jesus)
I watched so many people leave (Lord)
I see 'em change by the season, that's mama's sеasonin'
God got you, the devil's watchin', he just peekin' in
I know I madе a promise that I'd never let the reaper in (Jesus)
But lately, I've been losin' all my deepest friends (Lord)
And lately, I've been swimmin' on the deepest end
It's just drugs, it ain't no hugs, it ain't no love there
You been down so much you don't even know what's upstairs (Jesus)
Suicidal thoughts got you wonderin' what's up there (Lord)
And while I introduce the party, you say it's up there
Too many pills, so much potions, so much pain, too many emotions
And everything that you do good, it just go unnoticed (Jesus)
Did He tell you that you good and just stay focused? (Lord)
Mama, you was the life of the party
I swear you brought life to the party
When you lost your life, it took the life out the party (Jesus)
That woman rode with me like a Harley (Lord)
Visions of my cousins in a cell really scarred me
Movin' to the hood was like signin' up for the army
'Cause they been killin' niggas since niggas was watchin' Barney (Jesus)
You want dreams to come true? But I have nightmares (Lord)
'Cause if that come to life, then I might not be right here
Been in the dark so long, don't know if the light here
But I'm just reaching for the stars like Buzz Lightyear (Jesus)
And now I'm lightyears ahead of those nightmares (Lord)
I deaded those night terrors when the night clears
And if I talk to Christ, can I bring my mother back to life?
And if I die tonight, will I see her in the afterlife? (Jesus)
But back to reality, where everything's a tragedy (Lord)
You better have a strategy or you could be a statistic
Little boy dies, he's just one of the mystic
And mama steady crying 'cause she really the victim (Jesus)
And she's getting high and she's getting addicted (Lord)
And her older boy just stuck with the picture, painted vivid
That's a family portrait, and her daughter just absorbed it
Sixteen, pregnant, baby daddy say she should abort it (Jesus)
But we can't afford it, so she decides to move forward (Lord)
Baby shower time, father didn't show up
Now she just feeling nauseous like she finna throw up
The water flows down her legs, yeah, it's finna go up (Jesus)
A year done went by, her daughter just turned one (Lord)
And she's still dependent on her mom
Big brother in the streets, he went and bought him a gun
He want revenge 'cause the pain, feelin' numb (Jesus)
And her mom still doing drugs 'cause that's the only time she feel loved (Lord)
Is it real love? Do the scars really heal up?
From all the pain that done built up, but they don't feel us (Jesus)
A week done flew by, big bro ridin' then he see the guys (Lord)
Left his little brother on the side, bleeding from the side
He seein' red, it's like he's bleeding through his eyes
To see him dead, the only thing that'll help the grieving up inside (Jesus)
Even let him get the last meal
He done with the streets after this, this his last kill (Lord)
He gotta show him that it's that real
He ran up on him with the pipe like, "nigga, stand still" (Jesus)
"You took my brother life, you made my mother cry" (Lord)
"Tell me one reason I shouldn't send you up to Christ"
He said, "Go 'head, take my life, I've seen everything but Christ"
Then big bro just blacked out and all you seen was the light (Jesus, Lord)

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Now we've been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
He lives in a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Been through a lot of things
Tell me if you know someone that needs (Jesus, Lord)
Lyrics from Recording Session

[Chorus]
Hey, everybody, tonight's the night
I've been waiting my whole life
Who would have known what it was like?
Running from these flashing lights
Hey, everybody, tonight's the night
I've been waiting my whole life
Who would have known what it was like?
Running from these flashing lights

[Intro: Kanye West]
If I hit you with a "W-Y-D?"

I, I lived a hundred lives, uh
So that mean I had a hundred wives
And I am just simply high off life for the hundredth time

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Never let nobody curve me that don't deserve me
Should I really have bought the Burberry last Thursday?
Wear a different color jersey every Thursday
'Posed to meet in Malibu, you postin' pics in Jersey
Is to lay me or play mе a bigger flex though?
'Cause you know you'd nеver live up to my ex though
If we dive, it's the deep end, baby, let's go
I'll be gone by the weekend, baby, XO

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
Most insane out-of-body experience
And I repent for everything I'ma do again (I accept Him)
And I repent for everything I'ma do again

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Kanye West, Both]
Thank You, thank You, thank You for Your mercy, make me new
Make me new again, make me new again
Make me new again, make me new again
I repent for everything that I'ma do again
Make me new again, make me new again
Make me new again
Last night don't count
This morning don't count

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
If you take the ride, please don't close your eyes, uh
In a den of thieves, every man disguise, uh
Keep your mask on, keep it henne-tized, uh
It's a rollercoaster, keep your hands inside, uh
Wanna bring your pain, 'member this advice, uh
What they vandalize, He'll evangelize, uh
He gon' part the tides, He gon' part the skies, uh
Did it for the fame, 'member this advice, uh
What they vandalize, He'll evangelize, uh
What they vandalize, He'll evangelize, uh
He gon' part the tides, He gon' part the skies, uh
When they start to lie, 'member this advice, uh
What they vandalize, He'll evangelize, uh
When they start to lie, 'member this advice, uh
What they vandalize, He'll evangelize, uh

[Chorus: Sunday Service Choir]
Make me new again, make me new again
Make me new again, make me new again
Make me new again, make me new again
Make me new again, make me new again
Make me new again, make me new again
Make me new again, make me new again
Make me new again, make me new again
Make me new again, make me new again
Make me new again, make me new again
Make me new again, make me new again

Dig everything
Dig everything

[Verse 1]
I've got the village I love
I walk along beside the garbagemen and I dig everything
I wave to the policemen, but they don't wave back
They don't dig anything (dig everything)
Ain't had a job for a year or more and I don't own a thing (don’t own a thing)

[Pre-Chorus]
Everything's fine, I dig everything
Everything's fine, I dig everything
Dig!

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I feed the lions in Trafalgar Square
I dig evеrything
I've sit just behind my window, till my cigarettе’s low
I dig everything
Got a backstreet room in the bad part of town
I dig everything (dig everything)
I see people in the street below, who don't know where they're going
They don't dig anything (dig anything)

[Pre-Chorus]
Everything's fine, I dig everything
Everything's fine, I dig everything

[Bridge]
I've got more friends than I've had hot dinners
Some of them are losers, but the rest of them are winners
Rick, John, Sally, a connection named Paul
Holy low on money, their intentions are tall
We smoke and talk in my room
We dig everything

[Chorus]
Every
Everything
Every
Dig everything
Every
Everything (I’ve got)

Dig everything

[Verse 3]
I've made myself at home
I've made good friends with the time-check girl on the end of the phone

Even when it's not hot (dig everything)
'Cause I dig everything (dig everything)

Bow Bells strike another night
Your eyes are heavy and your limbs all ache
You've bought some coffee, butter and bread
You can't make a thing cause the meter's dead
You moved away
Told your folks you're gonna stay away

Bright lights, Soho, Wardour street
You hope you make friends with the guys that you meet
Somebody shows you round
Now you've met the London boys
Things seem good again, someone cares about you

Oh, the first time that you tried a pill
You feel a little queasy, decidedly ill
You're gonna be sick, but you mustn't lose faith
To let yoursеlf down would be a big disgrace
With the London boys, with thе London boys

You're only seventeen, but you think you've grown
In the month you've been away from your parents' home
You take the pills too much
You don't give a damn about that jobs you've got
So long as you're with the London boys
A London boy, oh a London boy
Your flashy clothes are your pride and joy
A London boy, a London boy
You're crying out loud that you're a London boy
You think you've had a lot of fun
But you ain't got nothing, you're on the run
It's too late now, cause you're out there boy
You've got it made with the rest of the toys
Now you wish you'd never left your home
You've got what you wanted but you're on your own
With the London boys

Now you've met the London boys
Now you've met the London boys
Now you've met the London boys

[Verse 1]
Fingertip sun at sideshow stalls
They throw the balls
At coconut fur that hides behind
Colored shades that blind your eyes
Every child's mother holds an ice-cream cone
They circle round
Perceived unknown by an eye that peers
From a hole in the tent where no one goes
A figure sitting cross-legged on the floor
He's clogged and clothed in saffron robes
His beads are all he owns

[Chorus]
Slow down
Slow down
Someone must have said "let's slow him down"
Slow down
Slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the karma man

[Verse 2]
Fairy tale skin
Depicting scenes from human zoos
Impermanent toys like peace and war
A gentle face you've seen before

Karma man tattooed on your side
The wheel of life
I see my times and who I've been
I only live now and I don't know why
I struggle hard to take these pictures in
But
All my friends can see is just the pinkness of his skin

[Chorus]
Slow down
Slow down
Someone must have said "let's slow him down"
Slow down
Slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the karma man

Slow down
Slow down
Someone must have said "let's slow him down"
Slow down
Slow down
It's pictured on the arms of the karma man

[Verse 1]
Your turn to drive
Thick as a line, out of your mind
You need the time
You're sweet and you're tired, watching the line
Watching the line
You're making my songs, you're making my heart
Your turn to drive
It's all in the songs, it's all in your mind
Your turn to drive
Drive
Turn tonight
So
Turn tonight
You gotta
Turn to...
You gotta turn tonight
Turn tonight
Turn tonight

[Verse 2]
Your turn to drive
You're making my songs, you're making my heart

You gotta
Turn to...
You gotta turn tonight
Turn tonight
Turn tonight
Turn tonight

[Verse 1]
Question-time that says I brought dishonour
My head's bowed in shame
It seems that I've blackened the family name
Mother says that she can't stand the neighbours' talking
I've gotta pack my bags, leave this home, start walking, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm guilty
I wish that I was sorry this time
I wish that I could pay for my crime

[Chorus]
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me

[Verse 2]
Remember when we used to go to church on Sundays
I lay awake at night, terrified of school on Mondays

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but it's too late now
I wish I was a child again
I wish I felt secure again

[Chorus]
I can't help thinking about me
I can't hеlp thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me

[Bridge]
As I pass a rеcreation ground
I remember my friends, always be found

[Chorus]
And I can't, I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me

[Verse 3]
Now I leave them all in the never-never land
The station seems so cold, the ticket's in my hand
My girl calls my name, "Hi, Dave
Drop in, see you around, come back
If you're this way again"

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm on my own
I've got a longer way to go
I hope I make it on my own

[Chorus]
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me
I can't help thinking about me

[Verse]
Mountains of Lhasa are feeling the rain
People are walking the Botella lanes
Preacher takes the school
One boy breaks a rule
Silly boy blue, blue, silly boy blue

Yak butter statues that melt in the sun
Cannot dissolve all the work you've not done
A chela likes to feel
That his overself pays the bill
Silly boy blue, blue, silly boy blue

You wish and wish, and wish again
You've tried so hard to fly
You'll never leave your body now
You've got to wait to die

La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
Silly boy bluе, blue, silly boy blue
Child of Tibet, you'rе a gift from the sun
Reincarnation of one better man
The homeward road is long
You've left your prayers and song
Silly boy blue, blue, silly boy blue
Silly boy blue, blue, silly boy blue

[Intro]
Can we talk about it now?
I mean the little trouble that we've been having lately
You know, I really— I really mean—
I really can’t stand the way, you know
That we're acting toward each other
It's just not right, you know

[Verse 1]
Ahem, yeah, they love me when the mic on
But then they show my dark side when the lights on
But fuck ’em in the ass with a pipe, homes
Fuck off and let me get my life on
You crackerjack, get your white on
I will send niggas to your house whilе your wife home
I'm Black and proud, right on
And since thеse lights on, let me get my bright on
Don't worry 'bout what I'm on
I own everything around me, now get the fuck from 'round me
I should pull out my dick and watch you climb on
Get the fuck up out my hair unless you're my comb
That mean mind yours because I'm grown
And I’ma die alone with my Styrofoam

[Refrain]
I hope you can dig what I’m saying now
And please don't get mad (Uh)

[Verse 2]
Like, get the fuck outta my business
’Cause I've been handling the fuck outta my business
Grinding, got perfect attendance
Flyer than first-class and detention
Uh, been a winner since a beginner
And my records show, now leave it in the Guinness
What do you mean, am I finished? I'm just getting started
Put you on the sideline like Vince Lombardi
Weezy, newborn baby, and it's my party
And I’m kicking like a horse on the stick-shift Ferrari
Like new cocaine, bright yellow dope
Bright red flag like a red velvet rope
I'm open for criticism
But really, is it any room for criticism? When the shit that's in 'em
Is deeper than your pool, so I swim in toilets
Bitch, I be and I been ballin', yeah

[Refrain]
I hope you can dig what I'm saying now (Uh)
And please don't get mad

[Verse 3]
And now I'm back like spinal, attack like rhino
Got the thunder like Lion-O and leave your head spinning like vinyl
I know, psycho but tight, though
Right, ho? But you could drown in my flow 'cause my flow is a tidal
Wave, you gon' need Geico or gecko
I go get from the get-go, go let
Let go, let's go, go where? Anywhere but nowhere
Colder than a polar bear's toenail
No frail, don't break, too real
Boy, I get it poppin' like New Year's
Scream "Hallelujah", I am the one, call me new year
My car windows dark and my diamond chains too clear
Like a light blink, bitch, I wear a ice rink
Syrup pink, that ice pink, pour it up for Pimp C
Pour it up for Screw and Moe, pour it up for Bun B
Pour it up for young me, nigga

[Outro]
You know, I mean, it's just, you know, I just think
Maybe love to you is buying me cars, giving me money
Buying me fancy clothes

[Intro]
Zone, I got lights in this bitch, turn me up somethin' Cruz
Jim in this bitch, Ellis in this bitch, wassup?
Uh
I bought the Richie for a quarter but I sold it for a nickel
(Hold on, lemme hit the blunt)
I'm bringin' real niggas home, shit, I'm the realest, it's official
Yeah, uh

[Verse 1]
When I start stressin', I get bored, might spend a million, that shit tickle
On a threeway, me and Slow, he caught L's and we both pick 'em
In the cell but you can't tell that we in the jail
'Cause we don't feel no pain unless them kids say in vain that I miss you
If you my dawg, I'm tryna put you on the shit that I'm on
Super drippy, made the Patek match the kicks I got on
Totin' the sеmi-automatic, ain't no pushin' me, dawg
Time bomb, niggas tickin' me off
Look at thе skyline from the penthouse, like Walt Disney, dawg
Send her to the mall and tell her, "Get some Dior"
Made her text her best friend, she said, "He Christian Dior"
And the crazy part about it, there wasn't shit in the yard
Shit, I been winnin' a long time, I know they sick of me, y'all
Got me switchin' up my flow again, switchin' up my hoe again
E'rrybody been changin', got me switchin' up my bro again
My dawg did his bid, he came back home and switched his pole again
And I ain't even wanna tell him to slide, he tryna go again
Once he got active, I said, "Go again," yeah
King in my trenches, I'm not active, all I know is when
Tote the blower, this like oh to ten, yeah

[Chorus]
And this expensive pain
When you ridin' through the trenches, bulletproof all on the Range
This expensive pain
Lovin' on the bitch you claim knowin' some rich niggas hittin'
It'll never be the same, this expensive pain
This expensive pain
Went through some shit about this money, I seen some niggas change, expensive pain
A million on the Richard, and it's plain
And it's crazy, I never check the time in all expensive frames
These Cartiers, I'm with your bitch and I just called her here, we all in here
Ask 'bout me in Starlets, shit, I used to ball in there

[Verse 2]
Shit, I been throwin' paper since Bernice was goin' hard in there, no kizzy
Yeah, expensive bitches, more money, more riches
Cops get behind us, we start takin' all switches
Niggas bein' nice, but we don't be in y'all business
Shit, how you think we always end up bein' in y'all bitches?
This is the same feelin' that you get like when you a kid on Christmas
I just knocked down a lil' celeb' and I was on her hit list
And I ain't been rappin', I been trappin', tryna learn my business
They thought I fell off, but they well off
I gotta keep my name worth more than money and gold
Remain humble around my people 'cause I don't spoil my soul
And I keep my dreams before fame and all these funny lil' hoes
'Cause I got two sons that's kings and they like three lil' bros
And they want everything they cop, I order them clothes
Gotta watch for everything, that dot'll spoil your ghost
And I be partyin' with people that got the word of control
'Cause they know I got the influence you can feel in your soul
This is culture currency, money shit don't ever worry me
Gotta have my chopper in front of this bitch, this shit been gettin' embarrassin'
She seen me cuddle with my stick, said, "Boy, you need some therapy"
And I can't lie, I prolly do, 'cause I still have dreams of niggas airin' me
It ain't no fuckin' fear in me
I let bad bitches fuckin' share me, and they love it, clearly
Used to fit eighty in them pockets, now we dub America
Besides, just cut the Cullinan up like I know culinary, yeah

[Chorus]
And this expensive pain
When you ridin' through the trenches, bulletproof all on the Range
This expensive pain
Lovin' on the bitch you claim knowin' some rich niggas hittin'
It'll never be the same, this expensive pain
This expensive pain
Went through some shit about this money, I seen some niggas change, expensive pain
A million on the Richard, and it's plain
And it's crazy, I never check the time in all expensive frames
These Cartiers, I'm with your bitch and I just called her here, we all in here
Ask about me in Starlets, I used to ball in there

[Outro]
See that girl right there?
I can see it in her eyes, she's a Dreamchaser

[Intro]
Brrr
Every time I get back in the streets, this shit get darker
Yeah, woo

[Verse 1]
Niggas can't hate on me now (Hate on me)
We do it all, we changin' the laws, they thinkin' 'bout takin' me down (Yeah)
We done put bulletproof all on the cars, I told 'em bring eighty more rounds (Brrr)
I put baguettes on all of my dawgs, they fall, they makin' a sound
I'm on a yacht with a bad thot, we got the streets in a headlock
Nigga tried to peep through the backyard, all he seen was the choppas and red dots (Brrr)
I got my mama a black card, yeah, I really put on for the head knock
This that 1AC, you ain't one of them rappers
And none of your steppers can step with my steppers
This chess, not checkers
I told my dawgs, "Don't stress, don't rush it," I really got off
It's seven on seven and I'm gettin' better and better and better, my nigga, it's never no pressure (Let's get it)
Every time I hit up one of y'all niggas with smoke, it's never no pressure
Niggas is pussy, if I put a price on your head, shit, I get the special
You know I be hangin' wit' Jews
Get money wit' Russians, I'm makin' my moves
The hood behind me, I never could lose, I'm good, I'm solid
Can't play me like one of them dudes
You probably end up on the news
We mobbin' and wildin'
You know we ain't tuckin' them jewels, especially for none of you dudes
We slidin' with choppers

[Chorus]
Rockin' Dior, I still remember me poor, I'm tryna get more (No cap)
Welcome to Philly where niggas get smoked for real tryna slide to the store (Brrr)
Send 'em with the stick, ghost the minivan stoley, slide with the door (Yeah)
Nigga gon' die in the streets, so we can't even beef, I'ma die on the Forbes
And the bitch-ass rat keep talkin' that shit like he can't get blitzed and die on the tour
Switchin' the lane up when I'm in that Wrangler and none of them boys can follow them boys
I got the game from the real OG's
And it's money over bitches, can't die 'bout a whore
I got the game from the real OG's
It's money over bitches, can't die 'bout a whore, yeah

[Chorus]
Hate on me now, hate on me now, I tell 'em hate on me now
Cut off them bitches and all of them leeches, so ain't no more weighin' me down (Let's get it)
Fresh out the jewelers, I jump out the bitches, they know I ain't playin' around
I triple-double whenever I bubble, these niggas in trouble, I'm sayin' it now, yeah
Hate on me now, hate on me now, I tell 'em hate on me now (Hate on me)
Cut off them bitches and all of them leeches, so ain't no more weighin' me down (Let's get it)
Hate on me now, hate on me now, niggas can hate on me now (Yeah)

Sittin' in the Phantom, countin' money in the sun
Everybody in my hood know I'm the one
Made it out the trenches, leave ten million for my son
They said it's the difference, it feel different how I come

[Chorus]
Put it on my soul, I can put it on my soul
We be goin' to the awards and I ain't puttin' up my pole
That new Virgil and Dior came through, I got it on

Ain't nothin' that I, it ain't nothin' that I can't hold
I'm gettin' everything I aimed for
I'm gettin' everything I aimed for
Bulletproof the Range Rove', niggas be on angles

Promise any nigga sayin' my name gon' get mangled (Boom)

[Verse]
Same niggas 'round me gettin' changed and they dangerous
Different colored riches in the pictures, Power Rangers
Come to fuckin' these bitches and gettin' this cash, no, we ain't stainless
Two hundred on the dash, been through the hood like I ain't famous
Sometimes I just be havin' to vent though, I ain't gon' lie
A lot people still left here like
Everybody prayin' I don't go back, but it's like, what you want me to do?
And leave my people?
And I can't leave my people, got that eye of the eagle
My homie wanted the Bentley but he died in the Regal
And I ain't never sell no heroin, auntie died from the needle
If you my opp, my daddy dyin' to meet you
'Cause I know the feeling when you fucked up and you lit
And nobody wan' see you, but when you come up and you rich
Everybody believe you, they use me too, I got useless
Think that's how I got even
Put my life on the line and sacrifice for my people

[Chorus]
Put it on my soul, I can put it on my soul
We be goin' to the awards and I ain't puttin' up my pole

Bulletproof the Range Rove', donut the Durango
Crazy all the shit that I obtain, I feel the same dose
My young nigga died in the streets lettin' his flame go
And I think about it every night 'fore I sleep, it make my brain go
(Thinkin' about it every night when I sleep)
Got me cuddlin' with my Glock when I sleep, can't let my flame go
(Got me cuddlin' with my Glock)
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Put it on my soul

[Chorus: Kehlani & Meek Mill]
Baby, you, oh, you were made for me (You know, you know)
Hit my phone, I'ma be there instantly (You know, you know)
I pray for us (I pray, I pray), pray your heart I'll always keep  (You know, you know, I pray my motherfuckin' soul to keep)
Just know I'ma ride for you, baby (I'ma ride), slide for you, baby, just say you got me (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Westside shorty, last summer was a hot girl
But it don't matter now, she my girl
A bucket list since you are my world
I introduced you to some other shit
Now you can't relate if niggas not thorough or not real
I'll tell you how I feel, but it's a lot still
'Cause I don't even know how I feel
But I'll kill for the love of the love you and I built
It's ride or die still
Your bills turnin' into my bills, shit done got real
It's not fake, every other day another sky date
Fuck in the '62s while we drivin' on the highway
Condo with the views out in Seoul, know the fly way
Fuckin' you from Monday all the way to Friday

[Chorus: Kehlani & Meek Mill]
Baby, you (You), oh, you were made for me (You were made for me, yeah, you know, you know)
Hit my phone, I'ma be there instantly (Be there instantly, you know, you know)
I pray for us (I pray, I pray), pray your heart I'll always keep (Always keep, you know, you know, I pray my motherfuckin' soul to keep)
Just know I'ma ride for you, baby (I'ma ride), slide for you, baby, just say you got me (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Told you that shit gon' be forever, gon' remember me
And every time you call, you know I'm pullin' up instantly
Them diamonds on your arm gon' shine forever, to infinity
So even if you leave, it's lit forever, feel my energy, I still
'Member fuckin' you off Hennessy and wildin' out
Deep all in it, tweakin' in it, got you howlin' out
Rich nigga, made me pull that Urus to your mama house
Them niggas on your mama block respect me, they see me hoppin' out
For real, I used to fuck you, all my chains on
And listen to all your stories about your ex, some shit he ain't doin'
I wasn't really tryna hear it, but you sound pressed, like you was hangin' on
I had to patch you up so many times, so baby, take it on you

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Baby, you, yeah, oh, you were made for me (Yeah, yeah)
Hit my phone, I'ma be there instantly (Be there instantly, you know, you know)
I pray for us, pray your heart I'll always keep (Heart I'll always keep)
Just know I'ma ride for you, baby (Ride for you, baby), slide for you, baby, just say you got me

[Post-Chorus: Kehlani]
Yeah, yeah, you got me feelin' like
Yeah, yeah, you got me feelin' like

[Chorus: Kehlani]
Baby, you, oh, you were made for me (You know, you know)
Hit my phone, I'ma be there instantly (You know, you know)
I pray for us, pray your heart I'll always keep (You know, you know)
Just know I'ma ride for you, baby, slide for you, baby, just say you got me

[Post-Chorus: Kehlani]
Yeah, yeah, you got me feelin' like
Yeah, yeah, you got me feelin' like
Yeah, yeah, you got me feelin' like

[Intro]
Hmm, this is my brother
Yeah this is
My rules, my rules, my rules, my rules, my—

[Chorus: Vory & Meek Mill]
(Yeah) I like the way you work it
Never met an angel that was perfect
I never met a demon that was worth it (Yeah)
They know the book Vor' come with amenities and plenty fees
Your favorite model is not a ten to me, I got ten of these
Your favorite rapper is still feeding off my energy
I just talked to Jeff, I told him strictly pesos
I just talked to Jeff, I told him strictly Bezos
'Cause I'm too rich to pay hoes

[Verse: Meek Mill]
Old niggas hatin' on the young niggas, damn
Young niggas wildin' out, beefin' on the 'Gram
I just hope this money don't make me lose who I am
It's funny 'cause this money make me lose all my friends
They say "It's something 'bout Meek Milly, he movin' different than them"
It's lil' fish, I take ya bitch for a swim
The jewelry loud but the Richard Millie plain, I let it whisper to them
That 33 on me like Pippen again, I been a bull
Niggas know I won't fold, I been to war
Rap beef, street beef, really done did 'em all
I get money, fuck bitches, and I ball
My haters linkin' over my haters, it's ten of y'all
And y'all still couldn't body me
Flow smoother than Wallaby
I do it so honorably
And y'all wonder why they proud of me
This shit is rare
Man, I had cops tryna lie on me
I caught a case at eighteen, they still was puttin' time with me
But looky here, I bounce back like every time
I'm 'bout a dollar but on every dime
I hit her once and I say never mind, yeah
I get my Audemars from Francois so I can stay ahead of time, ha
Catchin' Ms and I been catchin' tens
So many Bentleys and Rolls Royces, I can't trust a Benz
How could I ever trust a bitch when I done fucked her friends?
'Cause I know when we go our ways she gon' fuck my man
Damn, hate the game, not the players in it
They say you won't respect a ho until you layin' with her
And she on Versace sheets, pussy-playin' with it
I'm out here rappin' like I'm broke, you niggas playin' with it (Ha)
In the studio, I don't sleep
'Cause every time I drop, I make a million every week
I'm in a Aston Martin truck, she don't know if it's car or Jeep
But she ain't really trippin' 'bout it 'cause all she know is she with Meek, shit get deep
Shit, it get deeper and deeper, that shit y'all talkin' gettin' cheaper and cheaper
I'm tired of hearin' about y'all Pateks and them foreigns y'all leasin'
'Cause I got mansions 'round the corner from each other and I don't even see 'em
I gotta check 'em on camera just to make sure they good
And niggas had the nerve to tell me I don't be in the hood, I don't get it
Even if I did I wouldn't be with it
I'm used to being on islands with like twenty-three bitches
I'm used to ridin' 'round in bulletproofs with like two or three switches
Y'all niggas outside fifty deep, I'm with like two or three niggas in the mix
Deep down in it where y'all niggas ain't allowed at
You ever wear a Richard Millie where the wolves growl at?
My dog got a sentence, gave him life, he ain't allowed back
I already made it rich, I pray to God he give his time back
I'm living out my dreams, yeah, these niggas haters
'21 Maybach fly by, see you later
They ain't even here, they was quiet as a refrigerator
And I ain't even want 'em to see me 'cause I was faded, for real

[Chorus: Vory & Meek Mill]
(Yeah) I like the way you work it
Never met an angel that was perfect
I never met a demon that was worth it (Yeah)
They know the book Vor' come with amenities and plenty fees
Your favorite model is not a ten to me, I got ten of these
Your favorite rapper is still feeding off my energy
I just talked to Jeff, I told him strictly pesos
I just talked to Jeff, I told him strictly Bezos
'Cause I'm too rich to pay hoes (Pay hoes)

[Chorus: Brent Faiyaz]
Should I just wear a halo?
'Cause I already know too many angels (Know too many angels)
Should I just wear a halo? (Mhm)
'Cause I already know too many angels (Know too many angels, yeah, angels)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Yeah
I've been grindin' all my life, chasin' dreams
Not really payin' attention what it do to my health
And I could tell you that this life ain't what it seems
But no matter what it is, I stay true to myself
I say, "Young nigga rumble and stay humble through the fake shit"
All this money and bad bitches, I'm in the matrix
Tryna be successful and still fighting open cases
At times I get angry at God, like, "Why you take Nip?"
Got me losin' hope in the hood, I'm feelin' hatrеd
From niggas that look just like me, same color facеs
She say she ain't fuck in a year, I told her taste it
She did it on the first night, and I'm lookin' for my first wife
Tryna find trust in my heart, but it don't work right
Think I'm gettin' numb to the pain, 'cause it don't hurt right
I just wanna go to my hood, wheelie a dirt bike
And post up on the block with the ones that think that I forgot how we was standin' on the corner with them Glocks
But I know, if I go back to that corner, I'll get shot
Or get robbed, in a box to make me fade away
I miss y'all too but this my calling to go pave a way, for real

[Chorus: Brent Faiyaz]
Should I just wear a halo?
'Cause I already know too many angels (Know too many angels)
Should I just wear a halo? (Mhm)
'Cause I already know too many angels (Know too many angels, yeah, angels)

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Yeah
And everybody competin' on social media
Shit is fake, all it did was make us greedier
I got it all, and I be still feelin' needier
Tryna shine for all the times they ain't believe in us
So I kinda relate when I see you bein' fake
Shorty take that makeup off, I wanna see your face
Standin' in the club, poppin' bottles, sippin' Ace
Lookin' at the people, lookin' at me like I'm straight
Knowin' I've been goin' through some shit that I don't speak about
Lately I've been stressin' 'bout, man, fuck it, I'ma leave it out
Let 'em know my business, they gon' judge me, fuck it, keep 'em out
I been soul searchin' all alone, diggin' deeper now
Tryna find my truth, dream chasin' as a youth
Last night, shit, I was stressin', I woke up and bought a coupe
Put it on the 'Gram and made a caption, that was cool
But I feel better when I'm pickin' Papi up from school
Just chillin' with my mom, this feel better than when I'm chillin' with a dime, 'cause I know
All these hoes they ain't really on my side and I know
Say you're my bro, but he ain't really down to slide
And it's a few that got my back, and I could feel it in my spine
And we gon' chase these dreams
Pray the money never make me change
But I got two just to make these lanes
'Cause it's gon' make me aim even higher than ever
Sincerely yours, you know I'm grindin' forever

[Chorus: Brent Faiyaz]
Should I just wear a halo?
('Cause I already) 'Cause I already know too many angels
Should I just wear a halo? (Halo)
('Cause I already) 'Cause I already know too many angels

[Outro: Brent Faiyaz]
Though it gets hard for me, gotta make a living (A living)
Nigga got mouths to feed, can't turn up missing
Niggas do wrong by me, I'm unforgiving
Should I just wear a halo? (Halo)

Countin' these bands up, been fuckin' my hands up (Fuck it up)
I was in Paris, I pay for the drill, hit your mans up (Brrt)
Big Glock 40 on the hipline, hold my pants up (Hold it up)
She was confused, like, "How you the G.O.A.T. in a Lamb' truck? (She like, "What?")
Fuckin' this tall bitch from the back, say, "Stand up" (Woo)
Then put your motherfuckin' face down, ass up
Nigga been rich too long for makin' these songs, my nigga, it's past luck
Fuckin' this bitch too long, she offered a threesome and I just passed up
She wanna go in the 'Rari (Too small)
I wanna rip in the Wraith (Let's go)
I wanna look at thе stars (Stars), like I was hittin' in space (Yeah)
Nigga, how you gеt back home? (How he get back?)

Niggas ain't fuckin' with me, you niggas ain't fuckin' with me (Yeah, yeah, Harlem)
Niggas ain't fuckin' with me, niggas ain't fuckin' with me (Meek Mill, what up?)
Twenty bad bitches goin' up with the gang, they fuckin' for free (Ooh-ooh)
You call her phone, I call her phone, she comin' to me (Yeah)

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
Got a boss bitch, Dominican
Slim with the buns, cinnamon
Friend got the cake like Entenmann's
East coast bitch in Timberlands (Yeah)
Dip with the set like Killa Cam
Hop on a jet and we get a tan
Like Mortal Kombat when she throw it back, her friends like, "Finish him" (Right)
Run up, gon' flex, huh
It look like I'm looting in my closet, with the baguettes, huh
I just hit Will up with a deposit (Yeah), fill up my neck, huh
Lookin' like light bugs sittin' on my collar (Right)
We been stressed, huh, pull up with a mink, look like I am Chewbacca
Blocka-blocka, turned to shottas if them coppers try to pop us (Ferg)
Then go sit at John and Vinny's, have some pasta with some mobsters (Yeah)
Swervin' through Philly, I'm hangin' with Billies and nobody really can stop us (Woo)
Bia, Bia, we throw dollars, got your Bia pussy poppin' like
Bia, Bia, why you actin' like a ho? Like a ho
Bia, Bia, why you actin' like a ho? Like a ho
Bia, Bia, get yo' eyes up off my dough, off my dough
Bia, Bia, get yo' eyes up off my dough, off my dough (That's right)

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Niggas ain't fuckin' with me, you niggas ain't fuckin' with me (Niggas ain't fuckin'—)
Niggas ain't fuckin' with me, niggas ain't fuckin' with me (They can't touch us)
Twenty bad bitches goin' up with the gang, they fuckin' for free (Fuckin' for free)
You call her phone, I call her phone, she comin' to me
Bia, Bia

[Outro: Meek Mill]
Fuckin' this bad bitch from the projects, her name Tia
Head was good, the best on earth like Russ and Bia
Nigga asked me did I see her, but I ain't see her
But I did, 'cause she was tucked in the fahina
Spanish bitches goin' up like la marina
She a hot girl and I'm hot too, jalapeño
We sell work and she wan' work 'cause she a pinger
We gon' serve that lil' bitch
(Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang)
(Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang)

[Intro: Meek Mill]
(KJ, what you got goin' on, man?)
(Eza on the beat, he cooked that shit)
Fourth quarter
I ain't even gon' lie, man, I've been on some shit, lately
For real
(Yo, Nick Papz, make it slap)

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
I walk in the spot (Steppin')
I got what it takes to get to the top
The money I make, these niggas cannot compete
They know that I'm gettin' a lot
She give me the twat (Give me that)
Been countin' that pussy, I'm gettin' a lot
I know she a thot, still give her a shot
I fuck from the back 'til it's twistin' my sight
You know that I'm hot (Hot, hot, hot)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Yeah, this that city boy shit (Real city)
This shit crazy, we ain't evеn kiss, I put some shit on her wrist (Let's gеt it)
Shit was amazing, welcome the Lord's magic, flick of the wrist (Brr)
Pocket a chop' right next to the drop, you can't even pick up the shit
I gotta take a flick of this shit (Let's go)
I know my haters be sick of this shit
I put a bitch on a bitch (On a bitch)
Wake in the morning, I look in the mirror, it's crazy, I'm really this rich (Shit crazy)
Feedin' my children and makin' my millions, I'm really as real as it gets (For real)
Poppin' them wheelies and shit
I got a Glock with a ten on that shit and a switch on that shit, know we been on that shit
You know my niggas be sendin' that shit, we be goin' to war, we be winnin' that shit
We be spinnin' that shit, we be bendin' that shit, we be gettin' that money and spendin' that shit
Fives and tens and twenties, we never don't count 'em, we give 'em to women and shit
I be drummin' on jet with my members and shit, everybody in my hood gon' remember this shit (Yeah)
Swear to God that my hood gon' remember this shit
We can go back and forth like it's tennis lil' bitch, I don't go back and forth with no women and shit
Yeah, if we start it, you know we gon' finish it, yeah

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
I walk in the spot (Ooh)
I got what it takes to get to the top
The money I make, these niggas cannot compete
They know that I'm gettin' a lot
She give me the twat (Mmm, mmm)
Been countin' that pussy, I'm gettin' a lot
I know she a thot, still give her a shot
I fuck from the back 'til it's twistin' my sight
You know that I'm hot (Hot, hot, hot)

[Verse 2: Moneybagg Yo]
Hmm, hotter than juvie in '99 (Bah)
Drippin' Dior to my heel, pull up and hop out the whip to a lot of eyes (On me)
I put this shit on, for real, mixin' top dollar designer with Jordan 5s (Ghetto)
Really like fuck these niggas, I gave 'em a couple tries, now I'm cuttin' ties (Fuck)
This my life, your entertainment, I want the money, fuck bein' famous
Why is you fifty-three, still bangin'? (Huh?) Sick of these niggas, put me in containment
Umbrella in the Rolls case it rain, goin' wherever the money take me (Grr)
All this forever, don't it never change, don't think about it but I miss her brain (On God)
Hit the switch, let the stick blow, to ride this wave, you need a big boat
Poppin' shit 'cause I was piss poor, hotter than grandmama Crisco (Go)
I taught my niggas to move a lil' smooth (Why?), you can't even tell what the feds sayin' (Spy)
I'm in DC with a red skin, big FN

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
I walk in the spot (Steppin')
I got what it takes to get to the top
The money I make, these niggas cannot compete
They know that I'm gettin' a lot
She give me the twat (Give me that)
Been countin' that pussy, I'm gettin' a lot
I know she a thot, still give her a shot
I fuck from the back 'til it's twistin' my sight
You know that I'm hot (Hot, hot, hot)

[Intro]
I only can tell you the truth
Yeah, uh

[Chorus]
I seen so many niggas switchin', I had to cut 'em off
So many bitches actin' different, we stopped fuckin' raw
I upped the score, I went for more, shit, I'm like, "It's up to y'all"
And you ain't gotta talk behind my back, you know my number, call me, mmm
'Cause I heard they said I wasn't feedin' the team
I'm in the studio all night, shit, I'm like, "What do you mean?"
Shit, all them nights on private flights, feel like we livin' the dream
'Member we said we wouldn't let these bitches get in between
When people told me you was jealous, I just wouldn't believe (Believe)
And when niggas told me you was fuckin', no, I couldn't believe it

[Verse 1]
I tried to give you all my blessings, but you couldn't receive it
'Cause you was listenin' to people that was listenin' to people
I had to get up and leave you 'cause you couldn't even see it
All this fame, turned into a monster, shit like Resident Evil
And once the love turn toxic, think it's better I don't see you
'Cause I've been runnin' up my millions, shit been revving my ego
I put my money 'fore my bitches so we never get equal
'Cause then the world keep turning, the money keep burning
Living and I'm learning, ain't no bitches I'm concerned with
I seen everybody change on me 'bout some money
Learned to get rich, came home, niggas actin' funny, I can't cut it
I'm just strappin' and I ain't talkin'
Swear to God, none of y'all niggas better not grab for my coffin
Swear to God, bad bitches playing Simon Says when I'm talkin'
And I can't say I'm runnin' them trenches when I ain't walkin'

[Chorus]
I seen so many niggas switchin', I had to cut 'em off
So many bitches actin' different, we stopped fuckin' raw
I upped the score, I went for more, shit, I'm like, "It's up to y'all"
And you ain't gotta talk behind my back, you know my number, call me, mmm
'Cause I heard they said I wasn't feedin' the team
I'm in the studio all night, shit, I'm like, "What do you mean?"
Shit, all them nights on private flights, feel like we livin' the dream
'Member we said we wouldn't let these bitches get in between
When people told me you was jealous, I just wouldn't believe (Believe)
And when niggas told me you was fuckin', no, I couldn't believe it

[Verse 2]
Yeah, uh
Let me give you some game, how you gon' maintain?
'Cause niggas that hit it talk like bitches and they be saying things
And I know y'all booed up and that's cool, but did you know things change?
And you a good girl, but I seen good girls go play the same game
Turn to bad girls and make niggas rearrange things
And everything just turn into a blame game
Look at it like a watch, she could be a nice watch, you could get a plain Jane
You take that same watch, bust it down, it ain't worth the same thing
But it's gon' shine when the lights hit it, a little bling-bling
You add some diamonds to it, get a little shine into it
But think about it, take a good girl, add some wildin' to it
That's like a bust down Rollie, don't hold no value to it
And now you at the jeweler tryna trade it in
'Cause time is money, gotta watch what you spend
You can't make it again
I've been down this road with too many hoes and I can't take it again
Take me
Take me away, take me away, all my pain expensive
I got people tryna take me out like I ain't help invent 'em
Smell the venom like Baccarat and money on the menu
And I'll never cross nobody that helped me to a million
Why you even finessin'? I wasn't even checkin'
Look at yourself, bitin' the hand that gave you extra
Niggas tryna leave me for dead, but this ain't checkers
I act like I don't notice and then I bring it to your chest up
To the neck up
Aimin' at your head soon as I catch up
Too many millions, social media don't impress us
Too many feelings while I'm rappin', hope I don't mess up

[Chorus]
I seen so many niggas switchin', I had to cut 'em off
So many bitches actin' different, we stopped fuckin' raw
I upped the score, I went for more, shit, I'm like, "It's up to y'all"
And you ain't gotta talk behind my back, you know my number, call me, mmm
'Cause I heard they said I wasn't feedin' the team
I'm in the studio all night, shit, I'm like, "What do you mean?"
Shit, all them nights on private flights, feel like we livin' the dream
'Member we said we wouldn't let these bitches get in between
When people told me you was jealous, I just wouldn't believe (Believe)
And when niggas told me you was fuckin', no, I couldn't believe it

[Intro: Meek Mill]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah (Shoot through your car door, shoutout to Cardo)
Yeah, yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Yeah, look on the 'net and they talkin' 'bout bannin' me
Just left the dealer, I told him to Phantom me
I cannot be with no niggas that's fans of me
No kizzy
I don't know why these lil' niggas be playing with me
Murder for murder, they ain't understanding me
Take one of mine, that shit end with your family
Perkies, thirties, young niggas shooting like Currys
Walking in the club, no searching
Whack him for a check, yeah, surfin'
Spinning, sinning
Sinning, winning
I know the way that we living that wе probably going to Hell any minute
He nеver been on a mission, I see in his eyes, I can tell if he bitching
Treat him like Trey, get out the car, I know they gon' tell if he did it
My got them tickies for selling them brickies, but he ain't made the cell in a minute
Niggas been busting them U-eys, I'll never forget it, I ain't take a L in a minute
You a bitch, he a rat, he a fraud, on the 'Gram like he was that
Baby mama, she a groupie, in the Lamb', swerving with me eating gat
Big dog, real boss, make a call, nigga, you will be a pack
Cut a check, real nigga, credit card fraud, yeah, he was cap
Capping
I know you niggas be capping
I hit the switch on you, tapping
Two type of niggas, the niggas that watch and the niggas that go make it happen
I don't look up to no rappers
I ain't been talking no trapping
I've been investing, just chose up a check, it's ten million, and that was on test
Woo, I'm just turning up
When it's beef, shit, I can't sleep, that shit be burning me up
Front of Louis V, right on Rodeo, I pull up and donut the truck
What's a hundred to me? Give that shit to my homie and tell him go run that shit up
Niggas can't fuck with the gang
Big FN on me hang

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Yeah, Northside, Southside shit
Nigga, I ain't tripping out 'bout no bitch
I make the Maybach bounce, got shorty going up in the trap while she ride my dick
Niggas want internet clout, tell 'em spin on his house, I don't really wanna talk 'bout shit
Yeah, Northside, Southside shit
Yeah, Northside, Southside shit

[Verse 2: Giggs]
My niggas got bricks for cheapers, niggas got bits and pieces (Yeah)
Niggas just showing their weakness, man, they just quit, the weakest (Yeah)
Never no problem sleeping, Hollow just squish them leeches
Yeah, make it a scary movie, pussy, get trick or treated
Don't know what's up in it, he doesn't know, Hollowman's tapping it
Yeah, upping them out and they bitch on my left, how did he pattern it?
Yeah, nobody's clapping it
I put my back in it
Yeah, I got the strap, parked up, wrapping the rag on it
Yeah, Southside shit
Niggas all working outside shifts
Niggas get melt with drive-by clips
You never gon' work them Muay Thai kicks
Yeah, bounce that bitch
Pussy smells like fish
H got them Sheek, Styles like Kiss
Yeah, who's to be tested?
H, truth to be destined
Yeah, man get run over, vroom-vroom, who's the pedestrian?
Yeah, just got a new strap, boom-boom, shoot it for testing
Yeah, fuck the domestics, man just move to a next ting

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Northside, Southside shit
Nigga, I ain't tripping out 'bout no bitch
I make the Maybach bounce, got shorty going up in the trap while she ride my dick
Niggas want internet clout, tell 'em spin on his house, I don't really wanna talk 'bout shit
Yeah, Northside, Southside shit
Yeah, Northside, Southside shit

[Intro]
If you know I did it for you, why you ain't pay me back? (Why you ain't pay me back?)
Why I gotta tell you I love you so you can say it back?
Let the people manipulate you and it made you crack
Every time that you said you needed me, I gave you racks

[Chorus]
Ain't no love, ain't no love, ain't no love, left with my money (Ain't no love, left with my money, ain't no love, left with my money)
I put blood diamonds on bitches, leave a blood trail of money (Leave a blood trail of dead presidents and Dior)
I make millions, split it with niggas, you know that I be on it (You know and I know, you know and I know)
Gettin' busy on a four-fifty, ride or die, doin' a hundred (Ride or diе through the trenches likе I live in the hood)

[Verse 1]
I took them shackles off my wrist and then I made it ice (Let's go)
Same people crossed me say they sorry, but they ain't even make it right
I go to sleep with one eye of open, it's like a way of life
'Cause in them streets, you gotta keep it rollin' like we playin' dice (No crappin' out)
Niggas can't figure me out, I be on everything
You should see how it get in the house, it look like Medellin
Gold chopper sit on the couch, smokin' on better things (Brrt)
They seen I had holes in my heart and they tried let it bleed
Pastor sewed it up, I'm goin' up, now niggas texting me
People that I grew up with and they switched couldn't even get next to me
Do a favor for 'em, see if they real just like my specialty
Knowin' I don't even need to pay back, shit like a test for me (Shit like a test for me)
Niggas testin' me (Niggas testin' me)
Knowin' they the one that I made specially (Know that)
My mama crib like a million, my grandma crib like a buildin', I only put it on the 'Gram to give you the recipe

[Chorus]
Ain't no love, ain't no love, ain't no love left on my money (Ain't no love on my money, it's just blood on the money)
I put blood diamonds on bitches, leave a blood trail of money (Leave a blood trail of dead presidents and Dior)
I make millions, split it with niggas, you know that I be on it (You know and I know, you know and I know)
Gettin' busy on a four-fifty, ride or die, doin' a hundred (Ride or die, ride or die)

[Verse 2]
Too much money comin' in, I don't even count it
Maybach and the Cullinan, I don't even drive it
None of y'all niggas can't tell me I ain't solid
Assassination of my character 'cause I told you I ain't got it
Took some millions and I buried in them in so long that I forget 'em
Took my family and I carried us, brought us all up from the bottom
How you gon' say that I forgot you?
All them times I had to spot you
The only thing is 'bout a bitch that I done hit or made swallow
Know my dad died as a rival, but I'm still proud of my father
So I put Prada on his baby mama
And I had to tell my youngin in the trenches, "Don't you ever take no risks, you gon' spend it on designer" (On designer)
Ain't no love, ain't no love, ain't no love left on this money (On this money)
It's just blood left on this money
Blood on these bitches
Blood on the diamonds, blood on the back of the twenties
Showed too much love, he got whacked in December

[Chorus]
Ain't no love, ain't no love, ain't no love left on my money (Ain't no love on my money, it's just blood on the money)
I put blood diamonds on bitches, leave a blood trail of money (Leave a blood trail of dead presidents and Dior)
I make millions, split it with niggas, you know that I be on it (You know and I know, you know and I know)
Gettin' busy on a four-fifty, ride or die, doin' a hundred (Ride or die, ride or die)

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
When Snupe died, I was high, shit, I ain't get to feel it
And I can't lie, I been on my mind and I ain't hear this killin'
Too many guys been switchin' sides, it's only gettin' realer
Look in my eyes, when you see fire, turn me to a villain (Dougie on the beat)
All the money deals made me stress more
Made it out the hood, they think I'm blessed more
Seen my brother's true colors, ain't have a check for 'em
And when it come to my mother, don't even chеck on
Money and violence, I'm likе, "Fuck it, we wildin'"
Whether my dawg was right or wrong, shit, I'm like, "Fuck we, we slidin'"
Sometimes I need to be alone or go to an island and clear my mind up
And you can't cry 'bout that street shit once you sign up
My homie called me 'bout some cash, it fucked my mind up
Niggas was bitin' down my back, it fucked my spine up
You ain't even tell me that them niggas said they tryna rob us, you tryna slime us
Trust gettin' lower as the money go up
Heart gettin' colder, I've been very sober
When they say the opps died, we ain't trippin', we like, "So what?"
We ain't here to keep your name alive 'cause we know that it's over
It's over
It's over (Haha)
It's over

[Chorus]
They thought it was over, we got low in the city
I walk in, unload, and I might blow like three fifty
Tell my youngin' go and he will spin 'til he dizzy
Feelin' lucky to be my bro before my enemies get me
And I just wanna know his life from the beginning
Thought I was losin', they was switchin' sides
They tried to win and we winnin', yeah

[Verse 2]
Snakes in the grass, no hesitation, run 'em over
So I ain't even notice when I ran over a cobra
You was supposed to be my brother, in the trenches we was soldiers
And problems breakin' down, but now my Phantom got a chauffer
And I done bulletproofed the Rover
I can't trust nobody, I can't even invite nobody over
Perkies in my body, I feel less heavy when I'm sober
I did this for my family, I hope this money bring us closer
(Hope this money bring us closer)
Hope this money bring us closer
Whole lot of stuff been on my shoulders, niggas thought that it was over
I've been doin' my thing all quarantine, tryna clean my soul up
Niggas askin' when I'm droppin', shit, I was tryna get some closure
I was tryna see who with me in my darkest deepest moments
See my feelings, I won't want it

[Chorus]
They thought it was over, we got low in the city
I walk in, unload, and I might blow like three fifty
Tell my youngin' go and he will spin 'til he dizzy
Feelin' lucky to be my bro before my enemies get me
And I just wanna know his life from the beginning
Thought I was losin', they was switchin' sides
They tried to win and we winnin', yeah

[Intro]
Uh, yeah

[Verse]
I been a gangster since like five since my daddy died
Fifty mill' on my account, had to strategize
And when I got it out the mud, I wasn't satisfied
And Lord knows that I was sinnin', but I got gratified
So that shit got justified, every time we touch them pies
War with us, we test them guys
Street sweeper gon' dust them guys
Gotta watch 'em close
Some niggas snakes, don't trust them guys
My niggas said they cool, I'm like, "No, fuck that side"
It's only the mob, rep that shit like it's God
You sign up for this shit, if you switch, you gon' die
If you switch, you gon' die
'Cause I remember all them nights in my cell, I had a mill' to my name
Bills a hundred grand a month, you ain't hear me complain
I'm a G, I take my scars and I wear 'em in pain
You a flea, I cut you off if you chase the fame
You let this money come between us, I ain't barely seen ya
And when you come around, I spin you like a ballerina
Start fallin' back 'cause it got hot, shit like a jalapeño
And I been clutchin' on my Glock even though that I don't mean to
Niggas fake, I don't trust 'em, I wan' dust 'em
I peep they been on some shit, I think it's time to flush 'em
Slide back to back G-Wagons, movin' like the Russians
I'm the only thing that's poppin', of course they gon' discuss 'em, woah
I never thought it would come down to this
Ridin' bulletproofs and hundred rounds and shit
Millions off of rappin', I done found some shit
Deep off in the water, tryna drown some shit
I don't know where I'm goin', I just know I'ma win
And if I pray on my opps, Lord know I'ma sin
Lord know I'ma sin, yeah
And if I go to the hood, they gon' force me to kill
And if nobody gon' slide, I'ma load up and drill, that's no bap
It's no bap, mmm
I know what I gotta do
Hov told me 'bout this type of shit on volume two
Yeah, it was a hard knock life, but we was mobbin' through
And they could've coupled my niggas, but they was dyin' too
I keep my Glock, one in the head
Got me layin' with this shit with my son in the bed
And I won't go to sleep 'til every one of 'em dead
It's crazy this the type of shit that go to my head
I'm hangin' 'round with billionaires
But every time that I pop out, a bunch of killers there
Yeah, it's just money, ain't no feelings here
You wrap the rope and I'm gon' push the chair, yeah, ooh
So many lost lives 'cause niggas couldn't see the envy comin' from all sides
You let them niggas talk to you 'bout me and you crossed sides
And when they swing them choppers, I just hope you ain't offsides
Yeah, mm
Jealousy, envy, self hate

[Chorus]

[?] count the thorns in a bed of roses
No, the grass isn't always green
Don't you waste a single tear on me
Cause you still got more than I could ever need
Prettiest eyes that I could never save

[Verse]
I've been searching my soul
So long, so long
I went searching the dark, dark night
So long, long ago

[Chorus]

[?] thorns in a bed of roses
No, the grass isn't always green
Don't you waste a single tear on me
Cause you still got more than I could ever need
Prettiest eyes that I could never save

[Verse]
Found thе cloud with the silver lining
No, my hands werеn't always clean
Don't you waste a single tear on me
Cause you still got more than I could ever need
Prettiest eyes that I could never save

[Drop]

[Verse 1]
I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heart beat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
I used to think that I was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Pre-Chorus]
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Chorus]
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again

[Verse 2]
So many nights, my tears fell harder than rain
Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave
I'd rather die than have to live in a storm like before
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Pre-Chorus]
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Chorus]
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again

[Refrain]
I can't believe, I can't believe
I finally found someone
I'll sink my teeth in disbelief
'Cause you're the one that I want
I can't believe, I can't believe
I'm not afraid anymore
Goddamn, you got me in love again

[Bridge]
La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la
I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heart beat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
Oh, goddamn, you got me in love again
(We're in love, we're in love)
(We're in love, we're in love, oh, oh)

[Refrain]
I can't believe, I can't believe
I finally found someone
I'll sink my teeth in disbelief
'Cause you're the one that I want
I can't believe there's something left inside my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Chorus]
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again (Again and again)
Again (And again and again and again)
I'm thinkin' 'bout-a this whole world

Late at night I think about...

I'm singing in my heart
I'm singing in my heart
I'm singing love to sing I love
To sing it from my heart...

[Verse 1]
I wrote this letter to remind myself the reasons I'm alive
I got to reason number five
With my pen, I wrote on and I tried
To find words that described all the times
I caught myself and realised there are good things just ahead of me
But right now, it gets hard to believe
But I know that I'm safe when I leave

[Chorus]
And you can't speak to me
And when I can't receive
The words I know you mean
Anything can sеt me free

[Verse 2]
And I was broken, but a little part of mе thinks that I'm glad
I can go through things that make me sad
It's the only time off that I've had
Any more, then I start to go mad
Reason that I had at number one (Was I liked you)
Know the feeling well of being loved (Then number two)
I like the feeling of becoming numb (I can't choose)
Which one I prefer because you can't

[Chorus]
Speak to me
And when I can't receive
The words I know you mean
Anything can set me free (It's better you leave me be)

[Outro]
Reason that I had at number one (Was I liked you)
Know the feeling well of being loved (Then number two)
I like the feeling of becoming numb (I can't choose)
Which one I prefer because you can't
Reason that I had at number one (Was I liked you)
Know the feeling well of being loved (Then number two)
I like the feeling of becoming numb (I can't choose)
Which one I prefer because you can't

[Verse 1]
Did you ever want me? No worries if not
It's just that I told my mum, she thinks we're still going strong
She knows that I'm so fond of you that she can't ignore
How every day she knocks, but I don't answer my door
Every time I look outside my house, I try to make myself believe
(I can look at nature and feel good again)
You just call and text to say, "I want to talk," but I'm too scared to meet
(Is that why you think the worst of me?)

[Chorus]
Say we'll make up
Why'd you say that?
Why'd you break her?
('Cause I never got to teach myself at all)
How to not show myself let go?
All my friends know
That you think the worst of me

[Verse 2]
Even though you broke my heart
Now we're living worlds apart
Now I've blocked you since I'm smart
(Never got to teach myself at all)
Now that all that's done and said
I see all the time I spent
Not talking to my best friend
'Cause I thought the worst of me

[Verse 1]
Some days when I'm down just a little bit, I drop myself to the floor
It's not a problem if it hurts because I can't feel ache anymore
I only came back home because I wanted to see what's changed
And when I realise everyone's gone, but I still feel the same

[Chorus]
I wasn't meant to be
This bored at nineteen
My friend lived next to me
Now she won't wanna see
Me look differently
Now that I'm nineteen

[Verse 2]
And I wish that I could tell all my ex-jobs in retail
That I should've stayed at work 'cause of the A-Levels I failed
My cousin just told me that my favourite shop shut down
And the other one just told me that I've always got a frown

[Bridge]
My, my mind's alone because I'm alone
My mind's alone because I'm alone
(Enough the lot, I've had enough)
My mind's alone because I'm alone (The gore, the pain)
(I've had so much, I love to hate)
My mind's alone because I'm alone (The way I shaped because I'm hurt)
(And living rough)

[Chorus]
Wasn't meant to be (The gore, the pain)
(I've had so much, I love to hate)
(The way I shaped because I'm hurt and living rough)
This bored at nineteen
My friend lived next to me
Now she won't wanna see
Me look differently
Now that I'm nineteen

[Chorus]
So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me
And I'll be me

[Intro]
Sweet

[Verse 1]
Stunning 8K resolution, meditation app
In honor of the revolution, it's half-off at the Gap
Deadpool's self-awareness, loving parents, harmless fun
The backlash to the backlash to the thing that's just begun

[Chorus]
There it is again
That funny feeling
That funny feeling
There it is again
That funny feeling
That funny feeling

[Verse 2]
The surgeon general's pop-up shop, Robert Iger's face
Discount Etsy agitprop, Bugles' take on race
Female Colonel Sanders, easy answers, civil war
The whole world at your fingertips, the ocean at your door
The live-action Lion King, the Pepsi Halftime Show
Twenty-thousand years of this, seven more to go
Carpool Karaoke, Steve Aoki, Logan Paul
A gift shop at the gun range, a mass shooting at the mall

[Chorus]
There it is again
That funny feeling
That funny feeling
There it is again
That funny feeling
That funny feeling

[Verse 3]
Reading Pornhub's terms of service, going for a drive
And obeying all the traffic laws in Grand Theft Auto V
Full agoraphobic, losing focus, cover blown
A book on getting better hand-delivered by a drone
Total disassociation, fully out of your mind
Googling "derealization," hating what you find
That unapparent summer air in early fall
The quiet comprehending of the ending of it all

[Chorus]
There it is again
That funny feeling
That funny feeling
There it is again
That funny feeling
That funny feeling

[Outro]
Hey, what can you say?
We were overdue
But it'll be over soon
You wait
Hey, what can you say?
We were overdue
But it'll be over soon
Just wait
Ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da-da-da-da-da
Hey, what can you say?
We were overdue
But it'll be over soon
Ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da-da-da-da-da

[Verse 1]
Another year
What can I do with this time here
Just another way to keep me alarmed
Year twenty-seven
Under my belt
I just wish that I could do what I want
Beneath the clouds, there is a storm
Raining down to the core
Mellow people in their space
Everything's about to change

[Chorus]
I think we're here for a reason
We're not misplaced or defeated
I think we're here for a reason
I think you're here for a reason

[Verse 2]
I hurt you most
I didn't want that
Sometimes fate has its plans for us, for us
I'm riding the wave till the end
Once it's over hope that you go ahead and press send
Couple messages go straight to my phone
That you love me so but I'm already gone

[Chorus]
I think we're here for a reason
We're not misplaced or defeated
I think we're here for a reason
I think we're here for a reason
We're not misplaced or defeated
I think we're here for a reason

[Verse 1]
I could go away give you space and
I could be a friend and if needed
Let you know the plan how convenient
I would see it through, through and through
The sun is bright shows the way
But other times it's blinding me to this day
I've put in all my time to see what it is
But nothing's on it's way down

[Chorus]
Oh, baby, baby, it's time
All we needed was time
Just to get us through
Oh, baby, baby, it's time
All we needed was time
Just to get to you
Oh, baby, baby, it's time
All we needed was time
Just to get us through
Oh, baby, baby, it's time
All we needed was time
And I'll get it for you

[Verse 2]
You were right
I never should've gone down that road
Don't mess with my grave, don't play with my bones
The worms pave their way into the home
Alone undercover longing for others but when
They come to visit, I get so bothered
A house far away with no doors where you cannot reach me
I waited for you

[Chorus]
Oh, baby, baby, it's time
All we needed was time
Just to get us through
Oh, baby, baby, it's time
All we needed was time
Just to get to you
Oh, baby, baby, it's time
All we needed was time
Just to get us through
Oh, baby, baby, it's time
All we needed was time
Just to get to you

[Verse 1]
Hold on now, proud
Time on earth has ended
Your turn to leave defenseless

[Chorus]
Hey, do you see me now?
Hey, do you see me now?

[Verse 2]
Pierce me, I bleed
Come down, feel the rain
Just another reason to try

[Chorus]
What's it gonna take for me to grow?
What’s it gonna take for you to know?
For you to know
What's it gonna take for me to grow?
What's it gonna take for you to know?
For you to know

[Outro]
Hold on now, proud
Time on earth has ended
Your turn to leave defenseless

[Verse 1]
I see myself in you sometimes
I hear your voice inside my mind
To clear my head, I take a drive
I don't know why, but still I try

[Chorus]
I hope one day we'll meet again
I hope you won't forget my name

[Verse 2]
Remember what you said to me
Give all you've got until you bleed
One day I'm sure they all will see
Your secret's safe here with me

[Chorus]
I hope one day we'll meet again
I hope you won't forget my name
I hope one day we'll meet again
I hope you won't forget my namе

[Bridge]
Something's bound to grow apart
It's strange to me that you arе gone
But then was then and now is lost
Take it to the grave with me, you'll see

[Chorus]
I hope one day we'll meet again
I hope you won't forget my name

[Outro]
And I have seen them go
We would never fake it
I can keep it slow
Someone would embrace it
I have seen them go
We would never fake it
I can take it slow
Someone would've

[Verse 1]
My time is coming to a halt
Who cares who's right and who's wrong
Don't wanna give up, don't wanna reach out
If this is the end, then I'd like to shout

[Chorus]
You are my life
You are my love
You are my life
You are my love

[Verse 2]
Memories fade into the dreams
It's not what it seems to be
Don't wanna reach out, don't wanna give in
If this is the end, then goodbye friend

[Chorus]
You are my life
You are my love
You are my life
You are my love

[Bridge]
But wait
Oh, if this is the end
Then I'd like to go
Back wherе we began

[Chorus]
You are my lifе
You are my life
You are my life
You are my life

[Verse 1]
I got nothing to lose now
Nothing to see
That's just another lie now
I got nothing against you
Some things aren't real
I swear I'm trying to tell you

[Pre-Chorus]
Another bubble
I don't wanna take something back
Stay out of trouble
I don't wanna take something back
I lost you, I'm waiting and waiting

[Chorus]
I don't wanna take something back
I don't wanna take something back

[Verse 2]
Far away from where I've been
I'd like to be sure
That you're the best for me
And so when it's stronger
Than my old uncertainty
Then we will see

[Chorus]
I don't wanna take something back
I don't wanna take something back
(Something back, something back)
(Something back, something back)
(Something back, something back)
I don't wanna take something back
(Something back, something back)
Don't wanna take something back
(Something back, something back)
Don't wanna take something back
(Something back)
(Something back, something back)
Don't wanna take something back
(Something back)
(Something back, something back, something back)

[Verse 1]
I can't believe it's real
Hope to find another day
Pick me up and let me stay
Sometimes it's hard to feel
Try again give it a shot

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't wait for us to find our way
In this dark and lonely space
Someone helped me out today
I hope I could do the same

[Chorus]
Wake up wake up
Wake up wake up wake up wake up
Wake up wake up
Wake up wake up wake up wake up
Wake up wake up
Wake up wake up wake up wake up
Wake up wake up
Wake up wake up

[Verse 2]
What is that I hear
Hope to feel the words you say
Lift me up push me away
What's that I hear in your voice
Lately lately

[Pre-Chorus]
Wait for me to find my way
In this godforsaken place
Someone helped me out today
I hope I could do the same

[Bridge]
I can't wait to find
Wait to find
You
I can't wait to find
Wait to find
You

[Chorus]
Wake up wake up
Wake up wake up wake up wake up
Wake up wake up
Wake up wake up wake up wake up
Wake up wake up
Wake up wake up wake up wake up
Wake up wake up
Wake up wake up wake up wake up

[Verse 1]
Guess I might as well go back
Some things better left on track

[Chorus]
Oh, and I know just what it is
But I try and hold it in
Something new is on the rise
I might just see it through

[Verse 2]
When your life is off the trail
There is no one left to fail
I don't wanna just give in no, no, no, no
This could be where I begin

[Chorus]
Oh, and I knew just what it is
So I try and hold it in
Something new is on the rise
I might just see it through
See it through
See it through

[Verse 1]
Words on a page make me imagine
Another place where good things happen
Words on a page help me see
What's new with you?
What's wrong with me?

[Chorus]
Wait a minute, oh, I didn't want to hurt you
Please believe me when I say I do
When love is avoided paranoia grows
I think I can do better, but I just don't know
I just don't know

[Verse 2]
It's almost morning
Someone's telling me how
Nothing's easy when you live like that
The wind is calling
Telling me to look out
Someone keep me warm

[Chorus]
Wait a minute, oh, I don't wanna go that way
Just to wakе up at the end again
When lovе is avoided paranoia grows
I think we can do better, but I just don't know
I just don't know
I just don't know

[Verse 1]
I waited for you to call
The phone didn't ring at all
And when you told them no
Oh, how I felt that
In my bones

[Chorus]
I hope that you will wait some more
In time I will be at your door
I hope you won't forget my face
'Cause if you do I'll know

[Verse 2]
I'd like this trip to go on
For a million miles more
But there's this fork in the road
What can we do, alone?

[Chorus]
I hope that you will wait some more
In time I will be at your door
Big smiles finally in your home
But until then, unknown

[Intro]
Fuck

[Verse 1]
Listen to the wind blow
Watch the sun rise
Run in the shadows
Damn your love, damn your lies

[Chorus]
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now (You don't love me now)
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying (Still hear you saying)
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)

[Verse 2]
Listen to the wind blow
Down comes the night
Run in the shadows
Damn your love, damn your lies
Break the silence
Damn the dark, damn the light

[Chorus]
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now (You don't love me now)
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying (Still hear you saying)
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now (You don't love me now)
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying (Still hear you saying)
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)

[Outro]
(Chain, keep us together) Run in the shadow
(Chain, keep us together) Runnin' in the shadow
(Chain, keep us together) Runnin' in the shadow
(Chain, keep us together) Run in the shadow
(Chain, keep us together) Run in the shadow

[Chorus]
The light in you
Keeps pulling straight through
In the shadow too
In the shadow

[Verse 1]
Dearest friend, naked as a lake
In the shroud of winter blossom
In the crowd, my memory flashes
Flashes, flashes

[Chorus]
The light in you
Keeps pulling straight through
In the shadow too
In the shadow

[Verse 2]
In the end, there's nothing we can do
To contain a single blossom
Or explain the way she passes
Passes, passes

[Chorus]
The light in you
Keeps pulling straight through
In the shadow too
In the shadow

The light in me
Keeps pulling straight through
In the shadow too
In the shadow

[Verse 1]
I should have known
I'd leave alone
Just goes to show
That the blood you bleed is just the blood you owe
We were a pair
But I saw you there
Too much to bear
You were my life, but life is far away from fair
Was I stupid to love you?
Was I reckless to help?
Was it obvious to everybody else?

[Chorus]
That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see mе cry
There's just no time to diе

[Drop]

[Verse 2]
I let it burn
You're no longer my concern, mmm
Faces from my past return
Another lesson yet to learn

[Chorus]
That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die

[Refrain]
No time to die, mmm
No time to die, mmm
No time to die

[Drop]
No time to die
No time to die

[Outro]
No time to die
There's just no time to die

[Verse 1]
I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heart beat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
But, you got me in love again
I used to think that I was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
But, you got me in love again

[Pre-Chorus]
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever mеt somebody like you

But, you got me in love again

[Chorus]
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again

[Verse 2]
So many nights, my tears fell harder than rain
Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave
I'd rather die than have to live in a storm like before
But, you got me in love again

[Pre-Chorus]
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But, you got me in love again

[Chorus]
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again

[Refrain]
I can't believe, I can't believe

I can't believe, I can't believe
I'm not afraid anymore
You got me in love again

[Bridge]
La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la
I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heart beat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
Oh, you got me in love again
(We're in love, we're in love)
(We're in love, we're in love, oh, oh)

[Refrain]
I can't believe, I can't believe
I finally found someone
I'll sink my teeth in disbelief
'Cause you're the one that I want
I can't believe there's something left inside my chest anymore
But, you got me in love again

[Chorus]
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again (Again and again)
Again (And again and again and again)

Can you keep up

Saw a bird with a tear in his eye
Walking to New Orleans---my, my, my
Hey, now, Bird, wouldn't you rather die
Than walk this world when you're born to fly?

If I was the sun, I'd look for shade
If I was a bed, I would stay unmade
If I was a river I'd run uphill
If you call me you know I will
If you call me you know I will

Ooo, Freedom
Ooo, Liberty
O... Leave me alone
To find my own way home
To find my own way home

Say what I mean and I don't give a damn
I do believe and I am who I am
Hey now Mama come take my hand
Whole lotta shakin' all over this land
If I was an eagle I'd dress like a duck
Crawl like a lizard and honk like a truck
If I get a notion I'll climb this tree
Or chop it down and you can't stop me
Chop it down and you can't stop me

Ooo, Freedom
Ooo, Liberty
O ... leave me alone
To find my own way home
To find my own way home

Went to the well but the water was dry
Dipped my bucket in the clear blue sky
Looked in the bottom and what did I see?
The whole damned world looking back at me

If I was a bottle I'd spill for love
Sake of mercy I'd kill for love
If I was a liar I'd lie for love
Sake of my baby I'd die for love
Sake of my baby I'd die for love

Ooo Freedom
Ooo Liberty
O... Leave me alone
To find my own way home
To find my own way home
I'm gonna find my own way home
I'm lookin' out my window
Watch the clouds go by
I look to see eternity
The endless rolling sky
You cannot think of eternity
Thinkin' it like time
You try to think, you try to count
You just mess up your mind
Eternity, eternity
Baby, I love you, you love me
Let's love each other through eternity
Since before man could see
There was eternity
After man is come and gone
Eternity lingers on, eternity lingers on
Everything crawl, creep, or fly
Just live until they die
I lovе you, you love me
Let's lovе each other through eternity
Eternity, eternity
I love you, you love me
Let's love each other through eternity
Through eternity
Well I think about life, we don't know
Whether it all could be in vain
Look through time, it's for sure
It's the greatest gift to man
Music and Love, you can't explain
Try and understand
The greatest thing could ever be
We make love through eternity
Eternity, eternity
When the world think our defeat
Think that we are gone
We'll still have our place in peace
Our love will linger on, linger on
We won't care just what who said
If it's truth or lie
We'll still have our greatest gift
Love won't ever die
Love won't ever die
No, never die
Love won't ever die
Never, never
Never die
Way down upon Sycamore Slough
A white man sings the blues
Selling roses of paper mache
With flecks of starlight dew
I swiped a bunch and threw it your way
Where hazy moonlight glowed
Way down down along Lazy River Road
Way down upon Shadowfall Ward
End of the avenue
Run, hide, seek in your own backyard
Mama's backyard won't do
All night long I sang Love's Sweet Song
Down where the water flowed
Way down down along Lazy River Road
Moonlight wails as hound dogs bay
But never quite catch the tune
Stars fall down in buckets like rain
Till there ain't no standing room
Bright blue boxcars train by train
Clatter where dreams unfold
Way down down along Lazy River Road
Way down upon Sеminole Square
Belly of thе river tide
Call for me and I will be there
For the price of a taxi ride
Night double-clutches into today
Like a truck downshifting its load
Way down down along Lazy River Road
Thread the needle
Right through the eye
The thread that runs so true
All the others I let pass by
I only wanted you
Never cared for careless love
But how your bright eyes glowed
Way down down along Lazy River Road
Ten and ten is thirty, if you tell me it is so
Let's get down and dirty, baby. Let's get sweet and low
Any way you call the shot, That's how it's gonna be
You can serve it cold or hot, It's all okay by me
Tie me with a ribbon bow, Wrap me in cellophane
Send me out to steal the show or Samba in the Rain
Samba in the rain oh baby, Samba in the rain
Let's get down and dirty, Don't bother to explain
Don't care if they call a cop and say we are insane
We'll keep goin' til we drop. Samba in the rain
How many hours in a day? They tell me twenty four
There could be a couple less. I know there ain't no more
We can do the dirty bop, The Darktown Strutter's Ball
Just as long as we don't stop, We'll dance right up the wall
We can do the bump and grind The Apache in Spain
We can do the never mind or Samba in the rain
Samba in the rain oh baby, Samba in the rain
Let's get down and dirty. Don't bother to explain
Don't care if they call a cop and say we are insane
We'll keep goin' til we drop. Samba in the rain
Thought I heard a blackbird singin'
Up on Bluebird Hill
Call me a whinin' boy if you will
Born where the sun don't shine
And I don't deny my name
Got no place to go, ain't that a shame?

Thought I heard that KC whistle
Moanin' sweet & low
Thought I heard that KC when she blow
Down where the sun don't shine
Underneath the Kokomo
Whinin' boy -- got no place else to go

So many roads I tell you
So many roads I know
So many roads --
So many roads --
Mountain high, river wide
So many roads to ride
So many roads
So many roads
Thought I heard a jug band playin'
"If you don't -- who else will?"
From over on the far side of the hill
All I know the sun don't shine
The rain refuse to fall
And you don't seem to hеar me when I call

Wind inside & thе wind outside
Tangled in the window blind
Tell me why you treat me so unkind
Down where the sun don't shine
Lonely and I call your name
No place left to go, ain't that a shame?

So many roads I tell you
New York to San Francisco
All I want is one
To take me home
From the high road to the low
So many roads I know
So many roads - So many roads

From the land of the midnight sun
Where ice blue roses grow
'long those roads of gold and silver snow
Howlin' wide or moanin low
So many roads I know
So many roads to ease my soul
Who do you think you are?
What do you mean when you put us all down
Walking round in circles
Your nose to the ground
You think you're saying somethin'
Just 'cause you're makin a sound
You say you've seen it all
You don't care to see no more
But you don't get up an go
Until they throw you out the door
It's a long long long long way to go home
It's a long long long long way to go home
Any which way you are tempted to roam
It's a long long long long long long way
Way to go home
Who do remind me of
What do you do
When you do your own time
Did you run away
From the scene of your crime
I feel as though i know you
Could you spare me a dime
It's a lot less than a prison
But it's more than a jail
I'd tell you all about it
But that's another day
It's a long long long long way to go home
It's a long long long long way to go home
Any which way you are tempted to roam
It's a long long long long long long long long way
Way to go homе
You say you've seen it all
You don't care to see no more
Of thе hungry, the homeless
The sick and the poor
You say you've seen enough
To last you all your days
Like the moon in high heaven
You're just going through a phase
It's a long long long long way to go home
It's a long long long long way to go home
Any which way you are tempted to roam
It's a long long long long long long long long way
Way to go home
Who do you want to be?
What do you need
To set your body free?
I don't mean to pry
This ain't no third degree
But looking at you baby
You remind myself of me
If there's anyway to tell you
Anyway, anyway to persuade
I'd really love to spare you
The mistakes I've made
It's a long long long long way to go home
It's a long long long long way to go home
Any which way you are tempted to go
It's a long long long long long long long long way
Way to go home
Hog of a Sunday
Dog of a Monday
Get it back someday
What'd I say?
Movin' in close
Cut from a long shot
Fade on a downbeat
Ready or not ready or not

Chorus:
Corrina, Wake it up baby
Corrina, Shake it on down
Corrina, Corrina
Cruise through a stop sign
Loggin' up short time
Bird on a phone line
Soakin' up the Sun
Salt on a crowtail
What can I do?
I'm down by law
But I'm true to you true to you
Chorus:
If, what, where and when
Told at the proper time
Big black wings beat on the wind
But they don't hardly climb
There's a silver ocean
Silver clouds and silver sea
A bird on the horizon
Silver wingin' back to me

Chorus:
Wake it up baby
Shake it down easy
Bring it back someday
What'd I say?
Movin' in closer
Cut from a long shot
Fade on a downbeat
Ready or not ready or not
Corrina-Wake it up baby
Corrina-Shake it down easy
Corrina-Shake it up now
Corrina-Shake it back down
If, what, where, when and how
No it don't mean a thing to me
I would love you even if
You flew away from me
I'll just stand here waiting
On the far side of the sea
There is no fear that lovers born
Will ever fail to meet
Chorus:
Promises made in the dark

Chorus:

[Verse 1]
There were days
And there were days
And there were days between
Summer flies and August dies
The world grows dark and mean
Comes the shimmer of the moon
On black infested trees
The singing man is at his song
The holy on their knees
The reckless are out wrecking
The timid plead their pleas
No one knows much more of this
Than anyone can see anyone can see

[Verse 2]
There wеre days
And there wеre days
And there were days besides
When phantom ships with phantom sails
Set to sea on phantom tides
Comes the lightning of the sun
On bright unfocused eyes
The blue of yet another day
A springtime wet with sighs
A hopeful candle lingers
In the land of lullabies
Where headless horsemen vanish
With wild and lonely cries lonely cries

[Verse 3]
There were days
And there were days
And there were days I know
When all we ever wanted
Was to learn and love and grow
Once we grew into our shoes
We told them where to go
Walked halfway around the world
On promise of the glow
Stood upon a mountain top
Walked barefoot in the snow
Gave the best we had to give
How much we'll never know we'll never know

[Verse 4]
There were days
And there were days
And there were days between
Polished like a golden bowl
The finest ever seen
Hearts of Summer held in trust
Still tender, young and green
Left on shelves collecting dust
Not knowing what they mean
Valentines of flesh and blood
As soft as velveteen
Hoping love would not forsake
The days that lie between lie between
Awooo let's go S.O.S, she's in disguise
S.O.S, she's in disguise
There's a she wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out

[Verse 1]
A domesticated girl, that's all you ask of me
Darling, it is no joke, this is lycanthropy
The moon's awake now, with eyes wide open
My body's craving, so feed the hungry

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I've been devoting myself to you
Monday to Monday and Friday to Friday
Not getting enough retribution
Or decent incentives to keep me at it
I'm starting to feel just a little abused
Like a coffee machine in an office (Uh)
So I'm gonna go somewhere cozy to get me a lover
And tеll you about it (repeat about it)

[Chorus]
Therе's a she-wolf in the closet
Open up and set it free (Ah-ooh)
There's a she-wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe oh aha aha aha

[Verse 2]
Sitting across a bar, staring right at her prey
It's going well so far, she's gonna get her way
Nocturnal creatures are not so prudent
The moon's my teacher and I'm her student

[Pre-Chorus 2]
To locate the single men, I got on me a special radar
And the fire department hotline in case I get in trouble later
Not looking for cute little divos or rich city guys
I just want to enjoy (Uh)
By having a very good time
And behave very bad in the arms of a boy

[Chorus]
There's a she-wolf in the closet
Open up and set it free (Ah-ooh)
There's a she-wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe

[Bridge]
S.O.S, she's in disguise
S.O.S, she's in disguise
There's a she-wolf in disguise (ahh-woo)
Coming out, coming out, coming out
S.O.S, she's in disguise
S.O.S, she's in disguise
There's a she-wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out

[Outro]
There's a she-wolf in the closet
Let it out so it can breathe aha aha
(Ooh baby, ooh baby)
(Ooh baby, ooh baby)
(Ooh baby, ooh baby)
(Ooh baby, ooh baby)
(Ooh baby, ooh baby)
(Ooh baby, ooh baby, I'm in love)

I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh baby, ooh baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swaying
He's crazy y Cubano como yo, la, la
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, move baby
Move baby, move baby, move baby
Move baby, move baby, move baby
Move baby, move baby, move baby
Move, move, move,...
I'm in love
I'm in love

I'm in love

I can see my sweet boy swaying
He's crazy y Cubano como yo, la, la
On the balcony and I'm saying
I'm in love

Down on the West coast, they got their icons
Their silver starlets, their Queens of Saigons
And you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?

Down on the Wеst coast, they love their moviеs
Their golden gods and Rock n' Roll groupies
And you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?

You push it hard, I pull away, I'm feeling hotter than fire
I guess that no one ever really made me feel that much higher
Te deseo, cariño, boy it's you I desire
Your love, your love, our love

(I can see my baby swinging)
(His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up)
(On the balcony and I'm singing)
(Ooh baby, ooh baby, I'm in love)
I can see my sweet boy swaying
He's crazy y Cubano como yo, la, la
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, move baby
Move baby, move baby, move baby
Move baby, move baby, move baby
Move baby, move baby, move baby
Move, move, move,...
I'm in love
I'm in love

(Down on the West coast...)

(Down on the West coast...)

I'm in love

(Down on the West coast...)

(Down on the West coast...)

I'm in love

Pump it up, put it on, tell me, what you waitin' for?
Feel it deep in my soul, now it's out of control
I can't take it anymore

[Chorus]
Bring it back again, play my track again
Keep it hot for me
Make my body move, it's all up to you
What's it gonna be? (What's it gonna be?)
Play my joint again, play my jam
And send this one out to me
Bring it back again
It's a fact I need somethin' that I'm gonna feel
(Something that I'm gonna feel)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-woah-oh-no (Bring it back now)
Oh-woah-oh-no (Play my song now)

[Chorus]
Bring it back again, play my track again
Keep it hot for me (Bring it back, bring it back now, DJ)
Make my body move, it's all up to you
What's it gonna be? (What's it gonna be?)
Play my joint again, play my jam
And send this one out to me
Bring it back again
It's a fact I need somethin' that I'm gonna feel
(Something that I'm gonna feel)

[Intro]
(ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob)

[Chorus]
(Let's go) Getting woke up by the police (Every day, every day)
Every single damn morning (Ooo)
I put my left wrist on gold like a trophy (On my wrist)
I'm drippin' off a 'guetti, I can tell you what to go get (Let's go)

[Verse 1]
Probably could've been an athlete, but a nigga didn't get a chance (Heard, "You've got a fat chance")
Instead, I had got on my grizzy, then I came home with all kinds of bands (All colors)
Niggas wish they had this pretty bitch of mine, but you too late, my mans (T'hah)
Try to antagonize a nigga peer, but I turned to a king again (King, hah)
How the fuck you gon' ride on the opps (Opps), then turn around and tell it to the cops? (Ptuh)
Pipe it up, we got the millions, we too hot (We too hot)
Lightning light the ****, every single hot (Woo, woo)
Thinking 'bout my dead brother get me hot (Get me hot, hey)
Growing up, he taught me how to treat a thot (Treat a thot)
Taught me how the bitches leave when you rot (When you rot)
Told me get out the trenches, I'm too pop for 'em (Yeah)

[Chorus]
(Let's go) Getting woke up by the police (Every day, every day)
Every single damn morning (Ooo)
I put my left wrist on gold like a trophy (On my wrist)
I'm drippin' off a 'guetti, I can tell you what to go get (Let's go)

[Verse 2]
Let's talk about the block, all I've got is the block (And what?)
Servin' Alka-Seltzer Plus like it's rocks (Facts)
Way too little to understand when they say it's slowing up the trap (Huh)
Young nigga taking risks, I adapt (Let's go)
Walked into a junkie, "Where my money? You owe me" (Get me my money)
"Young broke nigga, get my money, you owe me" (Where my money?)
"Don't let the homies see you rockin' them new Rollies" (Or what?)
"Or they gon' take it off you" (Let's go)
I've been on the block with the same moonrocks (Been on the block)
Guess somebody got laid off (Ohh)
Don't pick at no corn 'til they can't grow scrap
Christmas trees, jingle bells down south (Ohh)
I just wanna turn the road
Like it's just some dice with every point one time (Ohh)
Machine gun riding, man, you sure you wanna come?
She suck it through the pocket, then I put it on her tongue (Ahh)
I told 'em I was biased, and I'm never sipping rum (Hey)
A hard time swallowing? I thought that it was yum (Apologize)
I took it out her stomach, then I put it in her butt (Her butt)
I took it out her momma, then I put it in her aunt (Her momma)
I bought the bitch some water, then she took the shit to Flint (Some water)
I told the bitch we gettin' it, and it will never ever end
I told her that she's been my "ever since" ever since
I told her I will never ever bring pink slips (Yeah)

[Chorus]
(Let's go) Getting woke up by the police (Every day, every day)
Every single damn morning (Ooo)
I put my left wrist on gold like a trophy (On my wrist)
I'm drippin' off a 'guetti, I can tell you what to go get (Let's go)

[Outro]
Help me up, help me up
You see me on the ground, then help me up
You see your nigga down, help him up
You see your bitch down, boot up
Hurry up, help me up
Help me up, help me up
You see me down, nigga, better help me up
I'm torn down, man, you better help me up, yeah

[Intro: Nate Ruess]
No, I'm not tryin'
To be the last thing you see when you turn your light off
You're makin' me feel something, but I know that it's wrong
Can't you see it's not who I wanna be? Yeah

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
'Cause I love you more than anything
Oh, I love you more than anything
'Cause I love you more than anything
Oh, I love you more than anything

[Verse: Young Thug, Young Thug & Nate Ruess]
Hoping you call 'bout anything
I love when you call me about anything
I love how you don't doubt anything
Like I said, get anything
'Cause I love the way you call my phone
And texting me, "Good morning", two shots of Patrón
Now we sexing 'til the morning, hate when you don't cum
You done told a nigga it's corny walking around with an attitude, oh, I'm supposed to be at a party
Girl, you know I love you, ain't disrespect whenever I'm tardy
Walking around with a shopping cart, we tearing down Barneys
Oh, girl, I want you badly

[Chorus: Nate Ruess & Young Thug]

[Outro: Gunna]
Metro
Oh, yes, I love you, I adore you
Put you up, I want more for you
Grab my heart, so hold you close
I won't let go of you
You the definition of loyal
And I know it's true
I give my heart to you
Won't be no love lost 'cause I love you
I'll have to hap a freight train
I rather rails from where I am
To the golf of Mexico, the Muscle Shoals Alabama. (Name of a state )
A felon Benton(name of a village)grave,condemned to walk a branded nam.(It means dying in war)
Thirty years of hard time, they cut you loose and set you free
There is bond to be a price for, every promise you don't keep
And I paid mine in that hellhole, where the Devil never sleeps
The warden  said to me,"Boy we are sympathetic to your cause."
As they majored me for my long, payne box.(It means checking his size for his coffin.)
And for that ball in chain,skin tight around the clock.(It means limited both in time and freedom and also it refers to  a short life.)
A prisoner sees his dreams in the shade of a key
I saw mine from that hole, folded hands on bended knees. ( disappointment before a death that you know it's about to happen.)
Where there is no forgiveness, nor honor among thieves.(the execution room and the one who pulls the trigger.)
Bad news come in threes
To no good, lying, killing thieves
Just one more branded man
With the mark of the beast
Thirty years of hard time
They cut you loose and set you free
There is bond and a price for every promise you don't keep
I paid mine in that hellhole
Where the Devil never sleeps
Wailing and gnashing of teeth
Where the Devil never sleeps

[Verse 1]
Well, I was feeling oh so bad

[Verse 1]
I had a hard run
Running from your window
I was all night running
I wonder if you care
I had a run-in
Run around and run down
Run around a corner
I run smack into a tree

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Verse 2]
Dressed myself in green
I went down under the sea
To see what's going down
Oh, and read between the lines
I was falling, falling
I turned around to see
Heard a voice calling
Running back to me

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Ran into a rainstorm
I duckеd back into a bar door
It was all night pouring, pouring
Not a drop on me
Test me, tеst me, test me
Why don't you arrest me?
Throw me in the jail house
Until the sun goes down

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Outro]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
Anymore

Said I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
Yes, and my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men

[Verse 1]
Well, I'm a wanted man in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good

Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

But you know he chose this place beside her
Don't get in the way, there's nothing you can say
Nothing that you need to add or do

Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Instrumental Break]

You gotta try to see a little farther

They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

Made me cry, Lord, she done me wrong
Hurt my eyes open, baby, that's no lie

'Cause I used to love her, but it's all over now
Yes, and I used to love her, but it's all over now (Over now)

[Verse 1]
When I was just a little young boy
Papa said "Son, you'll never get far
I'll tell you the reason if you wanna know
'Cause child of mine, there isn't really very far to go"
Baby, baby wants a gold diamond ring
Wants it more than most any old thing
Well, when I get those jelly roll blues
Why, I'd go and get anything in this world for you
Down to the jewelry store packing a gun
"Wrap it up. I think I'll take this one"
"A thousand dollars please," the jewelry man said
Dupree, he said, "I'll pay this one off to you in lead"

[Chorus]
Well, you know, son, you just can't figure
First thing you know you're gonna pull that trigger
And it's no wonder your reason goes bad
Jelly roll will drive you stone mad

[Verse 2]
Judge said, "Son, it's gonna cost you some time"
Dupree said, "Judge, you know that crossed my mind"
Judge said, "Fact it's gonna cost you your life"
Dupree, he said, "Judge, you know that seems to me to be about right"
Judge said "Son, I know your baby well
But that's a secret I can't ever tell"
Dupree said, "Judge, well it's well understood
You got to admit that that sweet, sweet jelly's so good"
Baby, baby's gonna lose her sweet man
Dupree come out with a losing hand
Baby's gonna weep it up for a while
Then go out and find another sweet man gonna treat her with style

[Chorus]
Well, you know, son, you just can't figure
First thing you know you're gonna pull that trigger
And it's no wonder your reason goes bad
Jelly roll will drive you stone mad

[Outro]
Same old story and I know it's been told
Some like jelly jelly, some like gold
Many a man's done a terrible thing
Just to get baby a shiny diamond ring

And that's a true story, folks

[Verse 1]
I woke today, felt your side of the bed
The covers were still warm where you'd been layin'
You were gone, my heart was filled with dread
You might not be sleeping here again

[Chorus]
It's alright, 'cause I love you
And that's not gonna change
Run me around and make me hurt again and again
But I'll still sing you love songs
Written in the letters of your name
And brave the storm to come
For it surely looks like rain

[Verse 2]
Did you ever waken to the sound of street cats making love?
You'd guess from their cries you were listening to a fight
Well, you know, oh, hate's just the last thing they're thinking of
You're only tryin' to make it through the night

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
I only wanna hold you, I don't wanna tie you down
Or fit you in the lines I might've drawn
It's just that I, I, I have gotten used to havin' you around
My landscape would be empty if you were gone

[Chorus]
It's alright, 'cause I love you
And that's not gonna change
Run me around and make me hurt again and again
But I'll still sing you love songs
Written in the letters of your name
And brave the storm to come
For it surely looks like rain

[Outro]
Yes, brave the storm to come, 'cause it looks like rain
Whole world's turning gray, here comes the rain
Ooh, here comes the rain (Brave the storm to come)
Here comes the rain
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, Lord
Here comes the rain
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, Lord
Here comes the rain
(Brave the storm to come)
Said it looks like rain and it feels like rain, Lord
Here comes the rain
Said it looks like rain and it feels like rain, Lord
Here comes the rain
(Brave the storm to come) Brave the storm to come
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, Lord
Here comes the rain
(Brave the storm to come)
Said it looks like rain and it feels like rain, Lord
Here comes the rain
(Brave the storm to come)

[Verse 1]
Gone are the days when the ox fall down
Take up the yoke and plow the fields around
Gone are the days when the ladies said "Please
Gentle Jack Jones, won't you come to me"

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 2]
1920 when he steppеd to the bar
Drank to the dregs of thе whiskey jar
1930 when the wall caved in
He made his way selling red-eyed gin

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

Delilah Jones was the mother of twins
Two times over and the rest were sins
Raised eight boys, only I turned bad
Didn't get the lickin's that the other ones had

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Bridge]
Tumble down shack in Big Foot county
Snowed so hard that the roof caved in
Delilah Jones went to meet her God
And the old man never was the same again

[Verse 4]
Daddy made whiskey and he made it well
Cost two dollars and it burned like hell
I cut hickory just to fire the still
Drink down a bottle and be ready to kill

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 5]
Gone are the days when the ox fall down
Take up the yoke and plow the fields around
Gone are the days when the ladies said "Please
Gentle Jack Jones, won't you come to me?"

Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

Firefly, can you see me?
Shine on, glowing, brief and brightly
Could you imagine one summer day
That same night be on your way
Do you remember? Hearts were too cold
The seasons have frozen us into our souls
People were saying the whole world is burning
Ashes have scattered too hard to turn

Upside out, inside down
False alarm, the only game in town

Terrible, the only game in town

Since it cost a lot to win
And even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time
Wondering what to choose

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

[Verse 2]
I've been gambling hereabouts
For ten good solid years
If I told you about all that went down
It would burn off both your ears

Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

Since you poured the wine for me
Tightened up my shoes
I hate to leave you sitting there
Composing lonesome blues

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

There's mosquitoes on the river
Fishes rising up like birds
It's been hot for seven weeks now
Too hot to even speak now
Did you hear what I just heard?
Say it might have been a fiddle (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Or it could have been the wind (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
But there seems to be a beat now (Ooh)
I can feel it my feet now (Ooh, ooh)
Listen, here it comes again

[Bridge]
There's a band out on the highway
They're high-stepping into town
(Oh, they're dancing into town)
It's a rainbow full of sound
It's fireworks, calliopes and clowns
Everybody's dancing

[Chorus]
Come on children, come on children
Come on and clap your hands

[Verse 2]
Wеll, the sun went down in honey
And thе moon came up in wine
And the stars were spinning dizzy
Lord, the band kept us so busy
We forgot about the time
They're a band beyond description
Like Jehovah's favorite choir
People joining hand in hand
While the music plays the band
Lord, they're setting us on fire
Crazy rooster crowing midnight (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Balls of lighting roll along (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Old men sing about their dreams (Ooh)
Women laugh and children scream (Ooh, ooh)
The band keeps playing on

[Bridge]
Keep on dancing through the daylight
Greet the morning air with song
No one's noticed, but the band's all packed and gone
Were they ever here at all? (Were they ever here at all?)
But they kept dancing

[Chorus]
Come on children, come on children
Come on and clap your hands

[Outro]
Well, the cool breeze came on Tuesday
And the corn's a bumper crop
And the fields are full of dancing
Full of singing and romancing
The music never stopped

[Instrumental]

Thank you. We're gonna take a short break, and you can, too

[Intro]
One, two, three, four, five, six

[Verse 1]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
Been so long I felt this way
But I'm in no hurry, no
Been so long I felt this way
Time sure passing slow
But I know I lead the way
Them voices tell me so

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, I know where I'll go

[Chorus]
California
Preaching on the burning shore
California
I'll be knocking on the golden door
Like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
I know I'm gonna shine

[Verse 2]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
Rainbows end down that highway
Where ocean breezes blow
My time coming as they say...
Still I know I lead the way
I know where to go

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about mе, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, I know where I'll go

[Chorus]
California
A prophet on thе burning shore
California
I'll be knocking on the golden door
Like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
I know I'm gonna shine

[Bridge]
You've all been asleep, you would not believe me (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
And them voices telling me you will soon receive me (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Shinin' on the beach, sea will part before me
(Fire wheel burning in the air)
You will follow me and we will rise to glory
(Way up the middle of the air)
And I'll call down thunder and speak the same
And my work fills the sky with flame
And might and glory gonna be my name
And they gonna light my way

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
Been so long I felt this way
Time sure passing slow
This afternoon, streets turned gray
And I watch the cars below
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no

[Chorus]
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, don't worry about me, no
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, no, I know where to go

[Outro]
No, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no, no (Ooh)
No, no, no, no, no (Ooh)

[Instrumental]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Right outside this lazy summer home
Ain't got time to call your soul a critic, no
Right outside the lazy gate of winter's summer home
Wondering where the nut-thatch winters
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
But the heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
There comes a redeemer, and he slowly too fades away
Follows a wagon behind him that's loaded with clay
The seeds that were silent all burst into bloom, and decay
And night comes so quiet, it's close on the heels of the day

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Sometimes we live no particular way but our own
Sometimes we visit your country and live in your home
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust nothing
But I know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh, I hope you understand
When it's done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Just looking for their kites
But I can tell your future
Oh, just look what's in your hand
But I can't stop for nothing
I'm just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep turning
While I'm playing in the band
If a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
The wheel is turning and you can't slow down
You can't let go and you can't hold on
You can't go back and you can't stand still
If the thunder don't get you then the lightning will

[Refrain]
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?

[Verse 1]
Round, round robin run around
Gotta get back to where you belong
Little bit harder, just a little bit more
A little bit further than you gone before

[Chorus]
The wheel is turning and you can't slow down
You can't let go and you can't hold on
You can't go back and you can't stand still
If the thunder don't get you then the lightning will

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Small wheel turn by the fire and rod
Big wheel turn by the grace of God
Every time that wheel turn 'round
Bound to cover just a little more ground
Bound to cover just a little more ground

[Chorus]
The wheel is turning and you can't slow down
You can't let go and you can't hold on
You can't go back and you can't stand still
If the thunder don't get you then the lightning will

[Outro]
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?
Won't you try just a little bit harder
Couldn't you try just a little bit more?

[Instrumental]

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land
Playing
Like a wave upon the sand
Daybreak
While I'm playing in the band

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Thank you

[Verse 1]
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There is an old cabin made of earth and wood
There lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
He never learned to read or write so well
But he could play guitar like ringing a bell

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go, go now Johnny B. Goode

[Verse 2]
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Go sit up in the trees by the railroad track
The engineers seen him sitting in the shade
Strumming to the rhythm that the drivers made
The people passing by would all stop and say
"Whoa, my, that little country boy can play!"

[Chorus]
Go go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny B. Goode

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
His papa told him "Someday you will be a man
You will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun goes down
Maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight"

[Chorus]
Oh, go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go, go, go Johnny B. Goode

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Oh, go, go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go Johnny go, go; go Johnny go, go
Go, go, go Johnny B. Goode
Thank you, good night

[Instrumental]

[Intro]
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Instrumental]

[Refrain]
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 1]
Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair
Yes, she had good looks, God knows, and coal black hair
Delilah she gained old Samson's mind
When first he saw this woman, oh, she looked so fine
Delilah she sat down on old Samson's knee
Said "Tell me where your strength lies, if you please"
And she spoke so kind, talked so fair
Samson said, "Delilah you cut off my hair
You can shave my head, clean as my hand
My strength become as natural as any old man"

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 2]
You read about Samson, all from his works
He was the strongеst man ever has lived on еarth
One day while Samson was walking along
Looked down on the ground he saw an old jaw bone
He stretched out his arm and his chains broke like threads
When he got to move, ten thousand was dead

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Now, Samson and the lion, they got in attack
Samson he crawled up on the lion's back
And you read about this lion, he killed a man with his paws
Samson got his hands up around that lion's jaws
He ripped that beast, God knows, he killed him dead
And the bees made honey in the lion's head

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down (Great God Almighty, talk)

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down
I would tear this whole building down

[Outro]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 1]
As I was walking 'round Grosvenor Square
Not a chill to the winter
But a nip to the air
From the other direction
She was calling my eye
It could be an illusion
But I might as well try
Might as well try

[Verse 2]
She had rings on her fingers
And bells on her shoes
And I knew without asking
She was into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias
Tucked into her curls
I knew right away
She was not like other girls
Other girls

[Verse 3]
In the heat of the evening
When the dеaling got rough
She was too pat to open
And too cool to bluff
I picked up my matchеs
And was closing the door
I had one of those flashes
I'd been there before
Been there before

[Bridge]
I ain't often right
But I've never been wrong
It seldom turns out the way
It does in the song
Once in a while
You get shown the light
In the strangest of places
If you look at it right

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
The wind in the willows played tea for two
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue
Strangers stopping strangers
Just to shake their hand
Everybody's playing
In the Heart of Gold Band
Heart of Gold Band

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Long distance runner, what you standin' there for?
Get up, get on, get out of the door
Drowned in your laughter and dead to the core
You're ... on the barroom floor
Dragon with matches loose on the town
Takes a whole pail of water just to cool him down

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Long distance runner, with one foot out the door
Caught in slow motion in a fall to the floor
You're playin' cold music on the barroom floor
You gave all you had, why you wanna give morе?
The more that you give, thе more it will take
That thin line beyond which you really can't fake

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Outro]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 1]
Truckin', got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

[Verse 1]
See arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

[Chorus 2]
Dallas, got a soft machine
Houston, too close to New Orleans
New York got the ways and means
But just won't let you be, oh no

[Verse 2]
Most of the cats you meet on the street speak of true love
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
And one of these days they know they better get goin'
Out of the door and down on the street all alone

[Chorus 3]
Truckin', like the do-dah man
Once told me "You've got to play your hand"
Sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay 'em down, no, no

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Verse 3]
Now, hat in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She's lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Living on reds and vitamin C and cocaine
All her friend can say is "Ain't it a shame"

[Chorus 4]
Truckin', up to Buffalo
I've been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
It takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

[Verse 4]
Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
You got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
Well, I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I bet you're gonna come in

[Chorus 5]
Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowling pin
And knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be, oh no

[Verse 5]
You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
Well, I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Outro]
Truckin', I'ma goin' home
Whoa whoa baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Ah, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Ah, get back truckin' on
Ah now, get back truckin' on

[Instrumental]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Spanish lady come to me, she lays on me this rose
It rainbow spirals round and round, it trembles and explodes
It left a smoking crater of my mind I like to blow away
But the heat come round and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day

[Chorus]
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)
Coming (Coming), coming (Coming), coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Escaping through the lily fields, I came across an empty space
It trembled and exploded, left a bus stop in its place
The bus came by and I got on, that's when it all began
There was Cowboy Neal at the wheel of the bus to never ever land

[Chorus]
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)
Coming (Coming), coming (Coming), coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)

[Verse 1]
Old man down
Way down down, down by the docks of the city
Blind and dirty
Asked me for a dime, a dime for a cup of coffee
I got no dime but I got some time to hear his story

[Verse 2]
My name is August West, and I love my Pearly Baker best, more than my wine
More than my wine
More than my maker, though he's no friend of mine

[Verse 3]
Everyone said
I'd come to no good, I knew I would, Pearly, believe them
Half of my life
I spent doing time for some other fucker's crime
The othеr half found me stumbling around drunk on burgundy wine

[Bridge]
But I'll get back on my feet somеday
The good Lord willing, if He says I may
I know that the life I'm living's no good
I'll get a new start, live the life I should

[Refrain]
I'll get up and fly away
I'll get up and fly away, fly away

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
"Pearly's been true
True to me, true to my dying day," he said
I said to him, I said to him, "I'm sure she's been"
I said to him, "I'm sure she's been true to you"

[Verse 5]
Got up and wandered
I wandered downtown, nowhere to go but just hang around
I've got a girl
Named Bonnie Lee, I know that girl's been true to me
I know she's been, I'm sure she's been true to me

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Well, the joint was jumping, going around and around
Hey, hey now, reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound
No, they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down

[Verse 1]
Well, it sounded so sweet now, I had to take me chance
Rose out of my seat now, 'cause I just had to dance
I started moving my feet, yes, and clapping my hands

[Chorus]
You know they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Hey, reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound
You know they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down
Moon went down now

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Well now, twelve o'clock now, and that old place was packed
The front doors, they was locked now, 'cause that old place was packed
But when the police knocked, well, them old doors flew b-back

[Chorus]
You know they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Hey, reeling and rocking, what a crazy sound
You know they never stopped rocking, no, no, 'til the moon went down
'Til the moon went down now

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Oh, it sounded so sweet now, I had to take a chance
Rose out of my seat now, 'cause I just had to dance
I started moving my feet now, oh yes, and clapping my hands

[Chorus]
You know they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Hey, reeling and a-rocking, what a crazy sound
You know they never stopped rocking, no, no, 'til the moon went down

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Well, they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Woo, reeling and rocking, what a crazy sound now
You know they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down now
You know they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Woo, reeling and rocking, what a crazy sound
You know they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down
You know they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Ooh, reeling and rocking, what a crazy sound
I said they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down
You know they never stopped rocking (Never stopped rocking, no)
Going around and around (They're going around and around)
Woo, reeling and rocking, what a crazy sound (Crazy, crazy sound)
You know they never stopped rocking (Never stopped rocking) 'til the moon went down
You know they never stopped rocking, going around and around (Going around and around)
Oh, reeling and rocking, what a crazy sound
You know they never stopped rocking, no, 'til the moon went down
You know they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Woo, reeling and rocking, what a crazy sound
You know they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down
You know they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Woo, reeling and rocking, what a crazy sound
You know they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down
You know they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Oh, reeling and rocking, what a crazy sound
You know they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down
You know they never stopped rocking, going around and around
Oh, reeling and rocking, what a crazy sound
You know they never stopped rocking 'til the moon went down
Thank you

[Verse 1]
There's a man standing on the stairs
And when he breathes, it shakes my structure
I don’t know when and I don't know where
But he says everything will be fine (yeah)

[Verse 2]
He calls me by my first name
That's funny ’cause I've never seen his face
And then he tells me to live for life
That it all will fall into place

[Chorus]
The clouds pass by like a man in a race
That loses control to keep up his pace
There is nowhere that I'd rathеr be than here
With you, my dеar

[Verse 3]
The gates open and close to a foreign tongue
And the river pushes my eye to an alternate universe
And I may be a giant
But the gates, they are too tall

[Verse 4]
And I chose to fall for it every time
They give me what I want
But it's never enough

[Chorus]
The clouds pass by like a man in a race
That loses control to keep up his pace
There is nowhere that I'd rather be than here
With you, my dear
Living off expired pride is getting old
And I've been eating precious gems, diamonds and gold
So much that I shine in the moonlight
But in the daytime, I'm never all that bright

I have forgotten that

That the skies, they are so big with your eyes open
And here's to hoping that I can open them wider than they've ever been
Because living off expired pride is getting old
Oh man, it's getting old

And all that is false glows in the dark
But you can nevеr find it when it's lit
You see, it's easy to be somеone you're not
When the someone you're not is all that you got
And you don't want to lose what you have

You have forgotten that

That the skies, they are so big with your eyes open
And here's to hoping that I can open them wider than they've ever been
Because living off expired pride is getting old
It's getting old, yes, it's getting old, yeah
My shadow, shadow is scared of itself
You can see it in its eyes
Its ears are starting to ache from the sound of lullabies
I'm almost hanging on, but when I jump, I just land shy
Of the ledge that I'm aiming for that is way too high

I have forgotten that
I have forgotten that

That the skies, they are so big with your eyes open (The afternoons I spent with you, the nights I prayed that you pull through)
And here's to hoping that I can open them wider than they've ever been (They're everything I gave to you, they're everything I gave to you)
Because living off expired pride is getting old (The afternoons I spent with you, the nights I prayed that you pull through)
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes, it's getting old (They're everything I gave to you, they're everything I gave to you)

[Lyrics from snippet]

[Verse]
I need closure
Baby just close your
Eyes and come close to mine

[Chorus]
Can you kiss me more?
We so young
If I call your name, would you answer me?
And if I said goodbye, would you stay with me?
And if I promise you a place to go, when you are all alone
Would you take it and be on your way home?

God put us on this Earth to love
And He can take us back in the name of blood
And I know that might sound a little unfair
'Cause at the worst times, He takes the one you care for
And as cancer eats and eats, I'm waiting for my long sleep to finally
Take me home

[Spoken]
And you'll finally be right where you belong
Where you were made, whеre you were mеant to be

When your feet touch the gold, the gold of the floor
And you'll see your past loved ones, and you'll need nothing more
Because you know that you're loved, wherever you are
We'll miss you so, but you're not that far
'Cause you're in our hearts
I am crazy, this is for sure (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
And I am alone, I got nothing no more (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
And I am not here and this is for sure (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
And I am not there, I am not anywhere (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Is it loaded my friend (Ooh, ooh)
Is it loaded, this don't have to end (Ooh, ooh)
But this is the lowest I've ever been in my whole life
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

I am broken beyond repair, I ain't going nowhere (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'll stay right here until I'm no more, take my light, may be what's in store (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I need someone to help me through, this black abyss so I can say my life is true (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Someone to show me what my life is really worth (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

Is it loaded my friend (Ooh, ooh)
Is it loaded, this don't have to end (Ooh, ooh)
But this is the lowest I've ever been in my whole life (Ooh)
Is it loaded my friend (Ooh, ooh)
Is it loaded, this don't have to end (Ooh, ooh)
But this is the lowest I've ever been in my whole life (Ooh, ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Spoken]
This one's for you
Memories, why you gotta be so far from me
I don't know (I don't know)
I don't need my life, all I need is to get some sleep tonight
But you making this hard, oh

Oh, you can have what you want
I will sell myself just to make it through
Another day with you
And just the thought of you-ou-ou-ou
Not with me makes me sad
So that's why I just don't think of love
(Oh whoa oh oh oh oh, oh whoa oh oh oh)

Gotta get back to the way it was, back when all we needed was still love
Oh the love, oh
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, I wanna see it fall in place
I never thought this way
But now I got to face the facts that I will never have you back

Oh, you can have what you want
I will sell myself just to make it through
Another day with you
And just the thought of you-ou-ou-ou
Not with me makes me sad
So that's why I just don't think of lovе
La, la, la

[Verse 1]
Silent night, Holy night
All is calm, all is bright
'Round yon Virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

[Verse 2]
Silent night, Holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heav'nly hosts sing Alleluia;
Christ the Savior is born
Christ the Savior is born

[Verse 3]
Silent night, Holy night
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth

[Spoken]
Happy Holidays

[Verse 1]
Paradise waits
On the crest of a wave, her angels in flames
She has no pain
Like a child she's pure, she is not to blame
Poised for flight, wings spread bright
Spring from night into the sun
Don't stop to run
She can fly like a lie, she can't be outdone
Tell me the cost
I can pay, let me go, tell me love is not lost
Sell everything
Without love day to day insanity's king
I will pay, day by day
Anyway, lock, bolt and key
Crippled but free
She can fly like a lie, I was learning to see

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Help on the way
Well, I know only this, I've got you today
Don't fly away
'Cause I love what I love and I want it that way
I will stay one more day
Like I say, honey, it's you
Making it too
Without love in a dream, it'll never come true

[Instrumental]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
In another time's forgotten space
Your eyes looked through your mother’s face
Wildflower seed in the sand and stone
May the four winds blow you safely home

[Chorus]
Roll away the dew
(You better) Roll away (Roll away) the dew
(You better) Roll away the dew
(I want you to) Roll away (Roll away) the dew

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
I'll tell you where the four winds dwell
In Franklin's tower there hangs a bell
It can ring, turn night to day
Can ring like fire if you lose your way

[Chorus]
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
(I want you to) Roll away the dew
(You better) Roll away the dew
(You better) Roll away (Roll away) the dew

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
God save the child that rings that bell
Might have one good ring, baby, you can’t tell
One watch by night, one watch by day
If you get confused, listen to the music play

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
Some come to laugh their past away
Some come to make it just one more day
Whichever way your pleasure tends
If you plant ice, you're gonna harvest wind

[Chorus]
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew

[Verse 5]
I'll tell you where the four winds sleep
Two lean hounds the lighthouse keep
Wildflower seed in the sand and wind
May the four winds blow you home again

[Outro]
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
(You better) Roll away (Roll away) the dew (Roll away)
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
Roll away the dew (Roll away)
Roll away the dew
Roll away the dew
(You better) Roll away (Roll away) the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew

[Verse 1]
When I woke up this morning, felt around for my shoes
That's when I knew I had them old, the walkin' blues
I woke up this morning, looked around, and felt around for my shoes
That's when I knew I had them old, mean old walkin' blues

[Veres 2]
Well, feel like blowin' my old lonesome horn
Woke up this morning, my lady was gone
Lord, I feel, feel like blowin' my lonesome horn
Woke up this morning, what I had was gone
What I had was gone

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Some people tell you the walkin' blues ain't bad
Worst old feelin' that I've ever had
Some people tеll you that the walkin' blues ain't so bad
Worst old feelin' I've most еver had, I've most ever had

[Verse 4]
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blind
I've been mistreated and I don't mind dyin'
I'm gon' leave in the morning if I have to ride the blind
Well, I've been mistreated and I don't mind dyin', don't mind

[Instrumental]

[Verse 5]
She got an Elgin movement from her head down, oh, to her toes
Breaking on a dollar 'most anywhere she goes
Woo-hoo, movement on down to her toes
Breaking on a dollar 'most anywhere she goes, anywhere she goes

[Verse 6]
I woke up this morning and I felt around for my shoes
That's when I knew I had them walkin' blues
I woke up this morning, I looked around and I felt around for my shoes
That's when I knew I had them mean old walkin' blues

[Outro]
Old walkin' blues, old walkin' blues, old walkin' blues, old walkin' blues
Old walkin' blues, old walkin' blues, old walkin' blues, old walkin' blues
Old walkin', old walkin', old walkin', old walkin'
Old walkin', old walkin' blues

[Verse 1]
Annie laid her head down in the roses
She had ribbons, ribbons, ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I could not leave her there

[Chorus]
I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I could not leave her there

[Verse 2]
Ten years the waves rolled the ships home from the sea
Thinking well how it may blow in all good company
If I tell another what your own lips told to mе
Let me lay 'neath thе roses, let my eyes no longer see

[Chorus]
I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I could not leave her there

[Verse 3]
One pane of glass in the window
No one is complaining though
Come in and shut the door
Faded is the crimson from the ribbons that she wore
And it's strange how no one comes 'round anymore

[Chorus]
I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I could not leave her there

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I couldn't leave her there

[Verse 1]
In the backwash of Fennario
The wolves are running 'round
The winter was so hard and cold
Froze ten feet 'neath the ground

[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Verse 2]
I sat down to my supper
It was a bottle of red whiskey
I said my prayers and went to bed
That's the last they saw of me

[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Verse 3]
When I awoke, the dirе wolf
Six hundred pounds of sin
Was grinning at my window
All I said was, "Come on in"

[Chorus]
But don't murder mе
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Verse 4]
The wolf came in, I got my cards
We sat down for a game
I cut my deck to the Queen of Spades
But the cards were all the same

[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Instrumental]

[Verse 5]
In the backwash of Fennario
The black and bloody mire
The dire wolf collects his due
While the boys sing around the fire

[Chorus]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Outro]
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me
Don't murder me
I beg of you, don't murder me
Please don't murder me
Please don't murder me

[Verse 1]
Now when your mother sends back all your invitations
And your father to your sister he explains
That you're tired of yourself and all of your creations

[Chorus]
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?

[Verse 2]
Now when the flower lady wants back all that she has lent you
And the smell of her roses does not remain
And when all your children, they all start to resent you

[Chorus]
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Now, when all the clowns you have commissioned
Have all died in battle or in vain
And you find yourself sick of all this repetition

[Chorus]
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?

[Verse 4]
Now when all of your advisers, they all heave their plastic
At your feet to convince you of your pain
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic

[Chorus]
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?

[Instrumental]

[Verse 5]
Now, when all the bandits that you turned your other cheek to
All throw down their bandannas and complain
Maybe you want someone that you don't have to speak to

[Chorus]
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?

[Outro]
Won't you come and see me, Queen Jane? (Won't you come and see me?)
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
(Won't you, won't you, won't you come and see, won't you, won't you come and see me?)
Won't you come see me, Queen Jane?
(Won't you, won't you come and see me, Queen Jane?)

[Verse 1]
Cold iron shackles and ball and chain
Listen to the whistle of the evening train
Know you bound to wind up dead
If you don't head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Verse 2]
Rich man step on my poor head
When you get back you better butter my bread
Read it this morning, children, and all it read
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Drink all day, gonna rock all night
The law come to get you if you don't walk right
Well, you know, children, it's like I said
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Verse 4]
I dropped four flights and cracked my spine
Honey, come quick with the iodine
Well, you know, people, it's like I said
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Verse 5]
I run into Charlie Phogg
He blacked my eye, you know he kicked my dog
My dog, he turned to me and he said:
Let's head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Verse 6]
I woke up feeling mean
I went down to play the slot machine
The wheels turned around, people, the letters read:
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Verse 1]
There's mosquitoes on the river
Fish are rising up like birds
Been hot for seven weeks now
Too hot to even speak now
You hear what I just heard?
It might have been a fiddle (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Or it could have been the wind (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
But there seems to be a beat now (Ooh)
I can feel it my feet now (Ooh, ooh)
Here it comes again

[Pre-Chorus]
There’s a band out on the highway
They're high-stepping into town
It's a rainbow full of sound
Fireworks, calliopes and clowns
Everybody’s dancing

[Chorus]
Come on children, come on children now
Come on and clap your hands

[Verse 2]
Well, the cool breeze around
Thе moon came up in wine
Stars werе spinning dizzy
Lord, the band kept us so busy
We forgot about the time
They're a band beyond description
Like Jehovah's favorite choir
People joining hand in hand
Let the music play the band
Lord, they're setting us on fire
Crazy rooster crowing midnight (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Balls of lightning roll along (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Old men sing about their dreams (Ooh)
Women laugh and children scream (Ooh, ooh)
And the band keeps playing on

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep on dancing through the daylight
Greet the morning air with song
No one's noticed, but the band's all packed and gone
Were they ever here at all?
But they kept on dancing

[Chorus]
Oh, come on children, come on children
Come on, clap your hands

[Outro]
Well, the sun beams are up
The corn's a bumper crop
The fields are full of dancing
Full of singing and romancing
The music never stopped

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
We'll be back in just a little bit

[Verse 1]
Patience runs out on the junkie
The dark side hires another soul
Did he steal his fate or earn it?
Was he force fed? Did he learn it?
Whatever happened to his precious self control?
Like him, I'm tired of trying to heal
This tomcat heart with which I'm blessed
Is destruction loving's twin?
Must I choose to lose or win?
Maybe when my turn comes I will have guessed
These are the horns of the dilemma
What truth this proof against all lies?
When sacred fails before profane
The wisest man is deemed insane
Even the purest of romantics compromise

[Chorus]
What fixation feeds this fever?
As the full moon pales and climbs
Am I living truth or rank deceiver?
Am I the victim or the crime?
Am I the victim or the crime?
Am I the victim or the crime, or the crime?

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
And so I wrestle with the angel
To see who'll reap the seeds I sow
Am I the driver or the driven?
Will I be damned to be forgiven?
Is there anybody here but me who needs to know?

[Chorus]
What it is that feeds this fever
As the full moon pales and climbs?
Am I living truth or rank deceiver?
Am I the victim or the crime?
Am I the victim or the crime?
Am I the victim or the crime?
Am I the victim or the crime?
Victim or the crime? Victim or the crime?
Victim or the crime? Victim or the crime?
Am I the victim or the crime? Victim or the crime?

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Your rain falls like crazy fingers
Peals of fragile thunder, keeping time
Recall the days that still are to come
Some sing blue
Hang your heart on laughing willow
Stray down to the floor
Deep sea of love
Beneath the cool dark waves of the sea
Swift undertow

[Chorus]
Life may be sweeter for this, I don't know
See how it feels in the end
While Lady Lullaby sing plainly for you
Soft, strong, sweet and true

[Verse 2]
Cloud hands reaching from a rainbow
Tapping at the window
Touch your hair
So swift and bright
Strange figures of light
Float in air
Who can stop what must arrive now?
Something new is waiting to be born
Dark as the night
You're still by my side
Shining side

[Bridge]
Gone are the days we stopped to decide
Where we should go, we just ride
Gone are the broken eyes we saw through in dreams
Gone, both dream and lie

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Life may be sweeter for this, I don't know
Feels like it might be alright
While Lady Lullaby sings plainly for you
Love still rings true

[Verse 3]
Midnight on a carousel ride
Reaching for the gold ring down inside
Never could reach it
It just slips away when I try

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust nothing
But I know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh, I hope you understand
When it's done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Just looking for their kites
Well, I can tell your future
Oh, just look what's in your hand
But I can't stop for nothing
I'm just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep turning
While I'm playing in the band
And if a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental]

[Lady with a Fan]

[Verse 1]
Let my inspiration flow
In token rhyme suggesting rhythm
That will not forsake me
'Til my tale is told and done

While the firelight's aglow
Strange shadows from the flames will grow
'Til things we've never seen
Will seem familiar

Shadows of a sailor forming
Winds both foul and fair all swarm
Down in Carlisle, he loved a lady
Many years ago

Here beside him stands a man
A soldier from the looks of him
Who came through many fights
But lost at love
While the storyteller speaks
A door within the fire creaks
Suddenly flies open
And a girl is standing therе

Eyes alight with glowing hair
All that fancy paints as fair
She takes hеr fan and throws it
In the lion's den

"Which of you to gain me, tell
Will risk uncertain pains of hell?
I will not forgive you
If you will not take the chance"

The sailor gave at least a try
The soldier being much too wise
Strategy was his strength
Not disaster

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
The sailor coming out again
The lady fairly leapt at him
That's how it stands today
You decide if he was wise
The storyteller makes no choice
Soon you will not hear his voice
His job is to shed light
Not to master

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Since the end is never told
We pay the teller off in gold
In hopes he will come back
But he cannot be bought or sold

[Terrapin Station]

[Verse]
Inspiration move me brightly
Light the song with sense and color
Hold away despair
More than this I will not ask
Faced with mysteries dark and vast
Statements just seem vain at last
Some rise, some fall, some climb
To get to Terrapin

Counting stars by candlelight
All are dim but one is bright:
The spiral light of Venus
Rising first and shining best
Oh, from the northwest corner
Of a brand new crescent moon
Crickets and cicadas sing
A rare and different tune

[Outro]
Terrapin Station
In the shadow of the moon
Terrapin Station
And I know we'll be there soon
Terrapin - I can't figure out
Terrapin - If it's the end or beginning
Terrapin - But the train's put its brakes on
Terrapin - And the whistle is screaming: Terrapin

[Instrumental]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
A pistol shot at five o'clock
The bells of heaven ring
Tell me what you done it for
No, I won't tell you a thing
Yesterday I begged you
Before I hit the ground
All I leave behind me
Is only what I found

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
If you can abide it
Let the hurdy-gurdy play
Stranger ones have come by here
Before they flew away
I will not condemn you
Nor yet would I deny
I would ask the same of you
But failing will not die

[Outro]
Take up your china doll
(Take up your china doll)
It's only fractured
And just a littlе nervous
From the fall

Na, na-na-na-na-na-na

[Verse 1]
Picture a bright blue ball just spinning, spinning free
Dizzy with eternity
Paint it with a skin of sky
Brush in some clouds and sea
Call it home for you and me
A peaceful place, or so it looks from space
A closer look reveals the human race
Full of hope, full of grace
Is the human face
But afraid we may lay our home to waste

[Chorus]
They say there's a fear down here we can't forget
Hasn't got a name just yet
Always awake, always around
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down

[Verse 2]
Watch as the ball revolves
And thе nighttime falls
Again the hunt begins
And again thе bloodwind calls
By and by again, the morning sun will rise
But darkness never goes
From some men's eyes
No, it strolls the sidewalks and it rolls the streets
Staking turf, dividing up meat
Nightmare spook, piece of heat
It's you and me
You and me

[Chorus]
Click flash blade in ghetto night
Rudy's looking for a fight
Rat cat alley, roll them bones
Need that cash to feed that jones
The politicians throwin' stones
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down

[Bridge]
Commissars and pin-stripe bosses roll the dice
Any way they fall, guess who gets to pay the price
Money green or proletarian gray
Selling guns instead of food today

[Chorus]
So the kids they dance and shake their bones
Politicians throwin' stones
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down
Ashes, ashes, all fall down

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Heartless powers try to tell us what to think
If the spirit's sleeping then the flesh is ink
History's page will be deeply carved in stone
The future's here, we are it, we are on our own
On our own
We are on our own
On our own
On our own
We are on our own
We are on our own
We are on our own
We are on our own
On our own
On our own
On our own
Own

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
If the game is lost then we're all the same
No one left to place or take the blame
We will leave this place an empty stone
Or that shiny ball of blue we can call our home

[Chorus]
So the kids they dance and shake their bones
Politicians throwin' stones
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down

[Verse 5]
Shipping powders back and forth
And black goes south and white comes north
In a whole world full of petty wars
Yeah, and I got mine and you got yours
And the current fashion sets the pace
Lose your step, fall out of grace
Radical, he rant and rage
Singing someone's got to turn the page
But the rich man in his summer home
Singing just leave well enough alone
His pants are down, his cover's blown

[Chorus]
And the politicians throwin' stones
So the kids they dance and shake their bones
It's all too clear we're on our own
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down
Singing ashes, ashes, all fall down

[Outro]
Picture a bright blue ball just spinnin', spinnin' free
It's dizzy with possibilities

[Verse 1]
I wanna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show you but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
You're gonna know just how I feel
Our love is real, not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
I wanna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away

[Outro]
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
(Not fade away) Not fade away
(Not fadе away) Not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
(Not fadе away) Not fade away

You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away

[Verse 1]
Everybody's building big ships and boats
Some are making monuments, and some are jotting down notes
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna jump for joy

[Chorus]
Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn
Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn

[Verse 2]
Like my sugar like the rest, I like my coffee sweet
But jumping queues and making haste, just ain't my cup of meat
Nobody can get no sleep, someone on everyone's toes
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna want a dose

[Chorus]
Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn
Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
If you do what I want you to, I can't decide in my heart
Tell me where to put it and I'll tell you who to call
Everybody's 'neath the trees, feeding pigeons on a limb
But when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, every pigeon's gonna run to him

[Chorus]
Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn
Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn
Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn
Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn
Come all without, come all within
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair
Ooh, she had good looks, God knows, and coal black hair
Delilah she gained old Samson's mind
When first he saw this woman, Lord, didn't believe his mind
Delilah she climbed up on Samson's knee
Said "Tell me where your strength lies, if you please"
She spoke so kind, God knows, talked so fair
Samson said, "Delilah, you cut off my hair
You can shave my head, clean as my hand
My strength come as natural as any old man"

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 2]
You read about Samson, all from his works
He was the strongest man that ever has lived on Earth
One day whilе Samson was walking along
Looked down on the ground he saw an old jaw bonе
He stretched out his arm, God knows, chains broke like threads
When he got to move, ten thousand was dead

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Now, Samson and the lion, they got in attack
Samson he crawled up on the lion's back
You read about this lion, he killed a man with his paws
Samson got his hands up around that lion's jaws
He ripped that beast, God knows, he killed him dead
And the bees made honey in the lion's head

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down (Great God Almighty, talk to me)

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down
I would tear this whole building down

If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Right outside this lazy summer home
Ain't got time to call your soul a critic, no
Right outside the lazy gate of winter's summer home
Wondering where the nut-thatch winters
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
There comes a rеdeemer, and he slowly too fades away
Follows thе wagon beside him that's loaded with clay
Seeds that were silent all burst into bloom and decay
Night comes so quiet, it's close on the heels of the day

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Sometimes we live no particular way but our own
Sometimes we visit your country and live in your home
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own

[Outro]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental]

[Intro]
- "Friend of the Devil"

[Verse 1]
I set out from Reno, I was trailed by twenty hounds
I didn't get to sleep that night 'til the morning came around

[Chorus]
I set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Verse 2]
Ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills
Spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills

[Chorus]
I set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
Just might get some sleep tonight

[Verse 3]
I ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar bill and he vanished in the air

[Chorus]
I set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Bridge]
Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night:
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie, and she's my heart's delight
The second one is prison, baby, the sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail

[Verse 4]
Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee
The first one say she got my child, but it don't look like me

[Chorus]
I set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
Just might get some sleep tonight

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night:
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie, and she's my heart's delight
The second one is prison, babe, the sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail

[Verse 5]
Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee
The first one say she got my child, but it don't look like me

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
Just might get some sleep tonight

[Intro]
- "Sugar Magnolia"
- You guys wanna listen to that?
- One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Head's all empty and I don’t care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

[Chorus]
She’s got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my ticket when I speed

[Verse 2]
She comеs skimmin' through rays of violet
She can wade in a drop of dеw
She don't come, I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you

Well, she can dance a Cajun rhythm
Jump like a Willys in four-wheel drive
She's my summer love in the spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She’s got everything I need
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
Lazing in the sunlight, yes, indeed

[Verse 3]
Sometimes when the cuckoo’s crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out and I walk around
I walk around

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
- Ooh, ooh
- Oh, oh yeah
- Ooh
- Let's go on to the next one, shall we?
- Sure, why not
- Which one will that be?
- Let’s see, uh...

[Intro]
- "The Candyman"

[Verse 1]
Come on you pretty women
With your hair a-hanging down
Open up your windows
'Cause the Candyman's in town
Come on, boys, and gamble
Roll those laughing bones
Won't you tell everybody near
That the Candyman's in town

[Chorus]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again

[Verse 2]
I come in from Memphis
Where I learned to talk the jive
When I get back to Memphis
Be one less man alive
Good morning, Mr. Bеnson
I see you're doing well
If I had me a shotgun
I'd blow you straight to hеll

[Chorus]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 3]
Come on, boys, and wager
If you have got the mind
If you got a dollar, boys
Lay it on the line
Hand me my old guitar
Pass the whiskey around
Won't you tell everybody you meet
That the Candyman's in town

[Chorus]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again

[Outro]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again


- Fucked up on the last part
- Hey, there's a radio in here

[Intro]
- "To Lay Me Down"

[Verse 1]
To lay me down once more
To lay me down
With my head in sparkling water
Let the world go by, all lost in dreaming

[Chorus]
To lay me down one last time
To lay me down

To lay me down, to lay me down
To lay me down one last time
To lay me down

[Verse 2]
To lie with you
Once more, to lie with you
With our dreams entwined together
Let the world go by, like clouds a-streaming
To tell sweet lies one last time
And say good night

[Chorus]
To lay me down, to lay me down
To lay me down one last time
To lay me down

[Verse 3]
To dream with you once more
To dream with you
With our bodies close together
To wake beside you, my love still sleeping

[Outro]
To lay me down one last time
Before the rain
To lay me down, to lay me down
To lay me down one last time
To lay me down

[Intro]
- "Truckin'"

[Chorus 1]
New Orleans
New York got the ways and means
And just won't let you be

[Verse 1]
Most of the cats that you meet on the street speak of true love
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they gotta get goin'
Out of the door and down to the street all alone

[Chorus 2]
Truckin', like the do-dah man
Once told me "You've got to play your hand"
Sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay'em down

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Verse 2]
What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost all her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, vitamin C, and cocaine
All a friend can say is "Ain't it a shame"

[Chorus 3]
Truckin', up to Buffalo
Been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
Takes time, you pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

[Verse 3]
Sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

[Chorus 4]
Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowlin' pin
Knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be

[Verse 4]
You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you'd like to settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and strike out and look all around

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Outro]
Truckin', I'ma goin' home
Whoa whoa, baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Woo
Get back truckin' on

[Intro]
- "Hand Me Down" provisionally

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
If my words did glow with the gold of sunshine
And my tunes were played on the harp unstrung
Would you hear my voice come through the music?
Would you hold it near as it were your own?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's a hand-me-down, the thoughts are broken
Perhaps they're better left unsung
I don't know, don't really care
Let there be songs to fill the air

[Chorus]
Ripple in still water
When there is no pebble tossed
Nor wind to blow

[Verse 2]
Reach out your hand, if your cup is empty
If your cup is full, may it bе again
Let it be known therе is a fountain
That was not made by the hands of men

[Pre-Chorus 2]
There is a road, no simple highway
Between the dawn and the dark of night
And if you go, no one may follow
That path is for your steps alone

[Chorus]
Ripple in still water
When there is no pebble tossed
Nor wind to blow

[Verse 3]
You who choose to lead must follow
But if you fall you fall alone
If you should stand then who's to guide you?
If I knew the way, I would take you home

[Outro]
Da-da-da, da, da-da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da
Da-da-da, da, da-da-da-da-da
Da, da, da-da, da-da-da-da-da
On to the next one

[Intro]
- "Brokedown Palace"
- Well, that's just the way it is

[Verse 1]
Fare you well, my honey
Fare you well, my only true one
All the birds that were singing
Are gone except you alone

Goin' to leave this brokedown palace
On my hands and my knees, I will roll, roll, roll
Roll up a bed by the waterside
In my time, in my time, I will roll, roll roll

[Chorus]
In a bed, in a bed
By the waterside I will lay my head
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

[Verse 2]
River gonna take me
Sing me sweet and sleepy
Sing mе sweet and sleepy
All the way back home
It's a far-gone lullaby
Sung many yеars ago
Mama, Mama, many worlds I've come
Since I first left home

[Chorus]
Going home, going home
By the waterside I will rest my bones
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

[Verse 3]
Going to plant a weeping willow
By the bank's green edge it will grow, grow, grow
Sing a lullaby beside the water
Lovers come and go - the river roll, roll, roll

[Chorus]
Fare you well, fare you well
I love you more than words can tell
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

[Outro]
Da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da, da-da, da, da, da
Da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da
Da, da-da, da, da, da
Da-da-da, da-da, da, da, da

[Intro]
- "Till the Morning Comes"
- You wanna have him do that, just come in on his, on his bass drum? *drums*
- Sure *drums*
- Okay
- I didn't get it *drums*
- Is that it? *drums*
- Yeah
- No, play ... in the beginning *drums* Is that too weird?
- I don't get it
- Okay, okay, now I get it *drums* Ah, it ain't the same, man. *drums*
- Forget it, forget it, fuck it. Don't do it
- Okay
- It was a good idea. One, two—oh, go ahead, count it

[Verse 1]
'Til the morning comes, it'll do you fine
'Til the morning comes, like a highway sign
Showing you the way, leaving no doubt
Of the way on in or the way back out

[Chorus]
Tell you what I'll do
I'll watch out for you
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy

[Verse 2]
'Til we all fall down, it'll do you fine
Don't think about what you lеft behind
The way you came or thе way you go
Let your tracks be lost in the dark and snow

[Chorus]
Tell you what I'll do
I'll watch out for you
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy

[Verse 3]
When the shadows grow, it'll do you fine
When the cold winds blow, it'll ease your mind
The shape it takes could be yours to choose
What you may win, what you may lose

[Chorus]
Tell you what I'll do
I'll watch out for you
You're my woman now
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy
Make yourself easy

[Verse 1]
In the attics of my life
Full of cloudy dreams unreal
Full of tastes no tongue can know
And lights no eye can see
When there was no ear to hear
You sang to me

[Verse 2]
I have spent my life
Seeking all that's still unsung
Bent my ear to hear the tune
And closed my eyes to see
When there were no strings to play
You played to me

[Bridge]
In the book of love's own dream
Where all the print is blood
Where all the pages arе my days
And all my lights grow old
When I had no wings to fly
You flew to me
You flеw to me

[Verse 3]
In the secret space of dreams
Where I dreaming lay amazed
When the secrets all are told
And the petals all unfold
When there was no dream of mine
You dreamed of me

[Intro]
- "Operator"
- Hey Pigpen, let's do "Operator"
- Where's that cappo? Where's that cap?
- Are we rollin'?
- Okay, let's start

[Verse 1]
Operator, can you help me?
Help me if you please
Give me the right area code
And the number that I need

My rider left upon the midnight flyer
Singing like a summer breeze

I think she's somewhere down South
Down about Baton Rouge
But I just can't remember a number
A number I can use
Directory don't have it, central forgot it
Gotta find a number to use

[Verse 2]
Trying to check out her number
Trying to run down her line
Operator said that's privileged information
And it ain't no business of mine

It's flooding in Texas, lines are down in Utah
Got to find a private line

She could be hanging round the steel mill
Working in a house of blue lights
Riding a getaway bus out of Portland
Talking to the night

I don't care where she's going, I don't know where she's been
I hope she's been doing it right

[Outro]
- Don't you wanna do a harmonica out? Wouldn't you like to do a harmonica out?
- Yeah. I can't do it now
- Okay
- But, you know, I...

[Verse 1]
I left my home in Norfolk, Virginia
California on my mind
Straddled that Greyhound, it rode me past Raleigh
And on across Carolin'
Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill
And we never was a minute late
We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown
Rolling across the Georgia state
We had motor trouble, it turned into a struggle
Halfway across Alabam'
When the Hound broke down
Left us all stranded in downtown Birmingham

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Sure as you're born I bought me a...
And I was on that midnight flyer out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans — that's right
So somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just help me get to Houston town
There's people there who care a thing about me
And they won't let the poor boy down
Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit
Put luggage in my hand
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Working on a T-bone steak a la carte
Flying over to the Golden State
When the pilot told us in thirteen minutes
We'd be heading in the terminal gate
Swing low sweet chariot, come down easy
Taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines, cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone
Los Angeles, give me Norfolk, Virginia
Tidewater four ten oh nine
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land calling
And the poor boy's on the line

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Thank you. Phil's got a broken string. In the heat of the moment, he dug in maybe a little too hard. So we're gonna take a moment here and fix it so we can get everything just exactly perfect. 'Cause we wanna have everything just exactly perfect for ya

[Verse 1]
Merry run around, sailing up and down
Looking for a shove in some direction
Got it from the top, it's nothing you can stop
Lord, you know they made a fine connection

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Verse 2]
He could pass his time, around some other line
But you know he chose this place beside her
Don't get in their way, there's nothing you can say
Nothing that you need to add or do

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
It's nothing, they explain, it's like a diesеl train
You better not be thеre when it rolls over
When that train pulls in, you don't know where it's been
You got to try to see a little further

[Chorus]
They love each other
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true
Lord, you can see that it's true

[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Me and my uncle went riding down
South Colorado, west Texas bound
We stopped over in Santa Fe
That being the point just about halfway
And you know it was the hottest part of the day

[Verse 2]
Well, I took the horses up to the stall
Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all
Three days in the saddle, you know my body hurt
It being summer, I took off my shirt
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt

[Verse 3]
West Texas cowboys, they's all around
With liquor and money, they's loaded down
Soon after payday, know it seemed a shame
You know my uncle, he starts a friendly game
Hеy, high-low jack and the winner take thе hand

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
My uncle starts winning; cowboys got sore
One of them called him, and then two more
Accused him of cheating; well, no, it couldn't be
I know my uncle, he's as honest as me
Hey, I'm as honest as a Denver man can be, that's me
One of them cowboys, he starts to draw
Well, I shot him down, Lord, he never saw
Shot me another, well, hot damn, he won't grow old
In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold
Hey, we high-tailed it down to Mexico

[Outro]
I love those cowboys, I love their gold
I love my uncle, God rest his soul
He taught me good, Lord, taught me all I know
Taught me so well, I grabbed that gold
And I left him lying there by the side of the road

I think maybe you folks up front might oughta maybe think about stepping back a little bit, because everybody up here is looking real flat with their eyes bugging out. So now it's time to play everybody's favorite fun game "Take a Step Back." Now, when I say the word, everybody take a step back. You ready? Now, take a step back. And another step back. And yet another step back. Doesn't everybody feel better?

[Verse 1]
On the day when I was born, Daddy sat down to cry
I had the mark just as plain as day that could not be denied
They say that Cain caught Abel rolling loaded dice
Ace of Spades behind his ear and him not thinking twice

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
If all you've got to live for is what you left behind
Get yourself a powder charge and seal that silver mine
Lost my boots in transit, baby, pile of smoking leather
Nailed a retread to my feet and prayed for better weather

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Say that when your ship comes in, first man takes the sails
Second takes the afterdeck, the third, the planks and rails
What's the point of calling shots
This cue ain't straight in line
Cue balls made of Styrofoam and no one's got the time

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way, on my way

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I woke today, felt your side of the bed
The covers were still warm where you'd been layin’
You were gone, my heart was filled with dread
You might not be sleeping here again

[Chorus]
But it's alright, 'cause I love you
That’s not gonna change
Run me around and make me hurt again and again
But I'll still sing you love songs
Written in the letters of your name
And brave the storm to come
For it surely looks like rain

[Verse 2]
Did you ever waken to the sound of street cats making love?
You guess from their cries you were listening to a fight
Well, you know, oh, hate's just the last thing they're thinking of
You're only tryin' to make it through the night, that's right

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
I only wanna hold you, I don't wanna tie you down
Or fit you in the lines I might’ve drawn
It’s just that I, I, I have gotten used to havin' you around
My landscape would be empty if you were gone

[Chorus]
But it’s alright, 'cause I love you
And that's not gonna change
Run me around and make me hurt again and again
But I'll still sing you love songs
Written in the letters of your name
And brave the storm to come
’Cause it surely looks like rain

[Outro]
(Rain is gonna come)
Yes, it looks like rain
(Rain is gonna come)
The whole world's turning gray, it looks like rain
Yeah, yes, it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh no
Here come the rain
(Brave the storm to come)
Yes, it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh, oh no
Here come the rain
(Brave the storm to come)
Brave the storm to come
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh, oh
Here the comes the rain
(Brave the storm to come)
Brave the storm to come
Yes, it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh now
Here comes the rain
(Brave the storm to come)
Yes, it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Here comes the rain
(Brave the storm to come)
Oh, it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Here comes the rain

[Verse 1]
As we rowed out to Fennario
As we rowed out to Fennario
Our captain fell in love
With a lady like a dove
And he called her by name, pretty Peggy-O

[Verse 2]
Will you marry me, pretty Peggy-O?
Will you marry me, pretty Peggy-O?
If you will marry me, I will set your cities free
And free all the people in the area-O

[Verse 3]
I would marry you, sweet William-O
I would marry you, sweet William-O
I would marry you but your guineas are too few
And I fear my mama would be angry-O

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
What would your mama think, pretty Peggy-O?
What would your mama think, pretty Peggy-O?
What would your mama think if she heard my guineas clink?
Saw mе marching at the head of my soldiers-O

[Verse 5]
If еver I return, pretty Peggy-O
If ever I return, pretty Peggy-O
If ever I return, your cities I will burn
Destroy all the people in the area-O

[Instrumental]

[Verse 6]
Come steppin' down the stairs, pretty Peggy-O
Come steppin' down the stairs, pretty Peggy-O
Come steppin' down the stairs, combing back your yellow hair
Bid a last farewell to your William-O

[Verse 8]
Sweet William, he is dead, pretty Peggy-O
Sweet William, he is dead, pretty Peggy-O
Sweet William, he is dead, and he died for a maid
And he's buried in the Louisiana country-O

[Outro]
As we rowed out to Fennario
As we rowed out to Fennario
Our captain fell in love
With a lady like a dove
And he called her by name, pretty Peggy-O

For those of you up front that can see, Mickey's got his headset on, and he's talking to the people that are hovering up there, you know, the people on the ship, the people in the sky. Mickey has extended conversations with them

[Chorus]
I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
Said I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
You see, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men

[Verse 1]
Well, I'm a wanted man in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good
Said I'm a wanted man in Texas, busted jail and I'm gone for good
Well, now, the sheriff couldn't catch me
But his little girl sure wished she would
You know she wished she would

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Well now, the doctor call me crazy, maybe I am, sometimes I ain't
Say now the doctor call me crazy, somеtimes I am, sometimes I ain't
You see, thе preacher man call me a sinner, but his little girl call me a saint

[Chorus]
Well, I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
Said I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
You see, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Said I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
Said I was born in a desert, raised in a lion's den
You see, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men

[Outro]
You see, my number one occupation
Is stealing women from their men

[Verse 1]
I lit out from Reno, I was trailed by twenty hounds
Didn't get to sleep that night 'til the morning came around

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Verse 2]
Ran into the devil, he loaned me twenty bills
I spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Verse 3]
Ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there
He took my twenty dollar bill and vanished in the air

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Bridge]
Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night:
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie, and she's my heart's delight
The second one is prison, baby, the sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail

[Verse 4]
Got a wife in Chino, babe, one in Cherokee
First one say she's got my child, but it don't look like me

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night:
The first one's named sweet Anne Marie, and she's my heart's delight
The second one is prison, baby, the sheriff's on my trail
And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail

[Verse 5]
Got a wife in Chino, baby, one in Cherokee
First one say she got my child, but it don't look like me

[Chorus]
Set out runnin' but I take my time
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
If I get home before daylight
I just might get some sleep tonight

[Verse 1]
There's mosquitoes on the river
Fish are rising up like birds
And it's been hot for seven weeks now
Too hot to even speak now
Did you hear what I just heard?
It might have been a fiddle (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Or it could have been the wind (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
But there seems to be a beat now (Ooh)
I can feel it my feet now (Ooh, ooh)
Listen, here it comes again

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a band out on the highway
They're high-stepping into town
It's a rainbow full of sound
It's fireworks, calliopes and clowns
Everybody's dancing

[Chorus]
Come on children, come on children
Come on and clap your hands

[Verse 2]
Well, the sun wеnt down in honey
And the moon came up in winе
And stars were spinning dizzy
Lord, the band kept us so busy
We forgot about the time
They're a band beyond description
Like Jehovah's favorite choir
People joining hand in hand
While the music plays the band
Lord, they're setting us on fire
Crazy rooster crowing midnight (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Balls of lighting roll along (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Old men sing about their dream (Ooh)
Women laugh and children scream (Ooh, ooh)
And the band keeps playing on

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep on dancing through the daylight
And greet the morning air with song
No ones's noticed but the band's all packed and gone
Were they ever here at all? (Were they ever here at all?)
But they kept on dancing

[Chorus]
Come on children, come on children
Come on, clap your hands

[Outro]
Well, the cool breeze came on Tuesday
And the corn's a bumper crop
And the fields are full of dancing
Full of singing and romancing
The music never stopped

[Instrumental]

Thank you. We're gonna take a short, we'll be back in just a few minutes. So you all hang out, get friends with the bugs. (Don't nobody go anywhere, we'll be right back.)

[Verse 1]
I had a hard run
Running from your window
Been all night running
I wonder if you care
I had a run-in
Run around and run down
Around a corner
Lord, I run smack into a tree

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Verse 2]
Dressed myself in green
I went down under the sea
Try to see what's going down
And read between the lines
I had a feeling I was falling, falling, falling, falling
I turned around to see
Heard a voice calling
It was running back to me

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Verse 3]
Drеssed myself in green
I went down undеr the sea
Try to see what's going down
And read between the lines
I had a feeling I was falling, falling, falling
I turned around to see
Heard a voice calling, calling, calling
It was running back to me

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Verse 4]
Ran into a rainstorm
I ducked back into a bar door
It was all night pouring
But not a drop on me
Test me, test me, test me
Why don't you arrest me?
Throw me in the jail house
Until the sun goes down

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Outro]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore

[Verse 1]
Well, I was feeling oh so bad

You see, something is not perfect. You saw, we must make it perfect so it will be beautiful. Yes, we will all beautiful together when it is perfect. Isn't that so? Isn't that written in the sky?

[Verse 1]
If I had a gun for every ace I have drawn
I could arm a town the size of Abilene
Don't you push me, baby, 'cause I'm moaning low
And you know I'm only in it for the gold

All I am asking for is ten gold dollars
And I could pay you back with one good hand
You can look around about the wide world over
And you'll never find another honest man

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down, go down

[Verse 2]
Don't you push me, baby, because I'm moaning low
But I know a little something you won't ever know
Don't you touch hard liquor, just a cup of cold coffee
Gonna get up in the morning and go
Everybody's bragging and drinking that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down, go down

[Outro]
Everybody's bragging and drinking that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time

Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Now we'd like to do a crazy little number that goes like this. One, two, one, two, three. Delay that. (One, two, three, four, five, six)

[Verse 1]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
Been so long I felt this way
But I'm in no hurry, no
Rainbows end down that highway
Where ocean breezes blow
My time coming, the voices say
And they tell me where I'll go

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
And ain't in no hurry
No, no, I know where I'll go

[Chorus]
California
Preaching on the burning shore
California
I'll be knocking on the golden door
Like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
I know I'm gonna shine

[Verse 2]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
It's gonna be just like they say
Them voices tell me so
Seemed so long I felt this way
But I'm in no hurry, no
My time coming is what they say
And they tell me where I'll go

Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, I know where I'll go

A prophet on the burning shore
California
I'll be knocking on the golden door
Like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
I know I'm gonna shine

Now, you've all been asleep, you would not believe me (Ooh, ooh)
But them voices telling me you will soon receive me (Ooh, ooh)
Oh, shining on the beach, the sea will part before me
(Fire wheel burning in the air)
And you will follow me, we will rise up to glory
(Way up the middle of the air)
And I'll call down thunder and speak the same
And my work fills the sky with flame
And might and glory gonna be my name
And they gonna light my way

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
Gonna be just like they say
Them voices tell me so
Seems so long I felt this way
And I'm in no hurry, no
Yes, I know I lead the way
And they tell me where I'll go

[Outro]
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
And I'm in no hurry
No, no, don't worry about me, no
Don't worry about me
No, no, no, I know where to go
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me
No, no, no (Ah)
No, no, no, no, no (Ah)
No, no, no, no, no (Ah)
No, no, no, no, no (Ah)
Ah no, ah no (Ah)
No, no, no, no, no (Ah)
Ah no, no, no, no (Ah)
No, no, no, no, no (Ah)

[Verse 1]
Right outside this lazy summer home
Ain't got time to call your soul a critic, no
Right outside the lazy gate of winter's summer home
Wondering where the nut-thatch winters
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
There comes a rеdeemer, and he slowly too fades away
Follows his wagon bеhind him that's loaded with clay
The seeds that were silent all burst into bloom, and decay
And night comes so quiet, it's close on the heels of the day

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Sometimes we live no particular way but our own
Sometimes we visit your country and live in your home
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own

[Outro]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Intro]
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 1]
Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair
Oh yes, she had good looks, God knows, and coal black hair
Delilah she gained old Samson's mind
When first he saw this woman, she looked so fine
Delilah, she sat down on old Samson's knee
Said "Tell me where your strength lies, if you please"
And she spoke so kind, she talked so fair
Samson said, "Delilah, you cut off my hair
You can shave my head, clean as my hand
My strength come natural as any old man"

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 2]
You read about Samson, all from his works
He was the strongest man that evеr has lived on Earth
One day while Samson was walking along
Lookеd down on the ground, he saw an old jaw bone
And he stretched out his arm, God knows, chains broke like threads
When he got to move, ten thousand was dead

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down (Great God Almighty)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Now, Samson and the lion, they got in attack
Samson, he crawled up on the lion's back
And you read about this lion, he killed a man with his paws
Samson got his hands up around that lion's jaws
He ripped that beast, God knows, he killed him dead
And the bees made honey in the lion's head

[Chorus]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down
If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I would tear this whole building down (One more)
I would tear this whole building down

[Verse 1]
Rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus]
Now he's gone
Now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, he's gone

[Verse 2]
Cat on a tin roof, dogs in a pile
Nothing left to do but smile, smile, smile
Nine mile skid on a ten mile ride
Hot as a pistol but cool inside

[Chorus]
Now he's gone
Now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back
He's gone

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
Going where the wind don't blow so strange
Maybe off on some high cold mountain chain
I lost one round but the price wasn't anything
A knife in the back and more of the same

[Verse 3]
Same old rat in a drain ditch, caught on a limb
You know better but I know him
Like I told you, what I said
Steal your face right off your head

[Chorus]
Now he's gone
Now he's gone, Lord, he's gone
He's gone
Like a, like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back
He's gone

[Outro]
Like a steam locomotive rolling down the track
He's gone, gone
And nothing's gonna bring him back, he's gone
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
(He's gone, gone, gone)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
(Ooh, nothing gonna bring him back now)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back (No, no, no)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
(Gone, gone, he's gone for good)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
(Nothing's gonna bring him back now, no, no)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
(Gone, gone, gone)
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
Ooh, nothing's gonna bring him back
(Ah, Lord, he's gone for good)

[Instrumental]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I wanna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
Not fade away now

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show you but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
You're gonna know just how I feel
So love is real, not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
I wanna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
Love, your love will not fadе away
See, love, your love will not fade away
Not fadе away (Not fade away)
Not fade away (Not fade away)
Not fade away (Not fade away)
Not fade away (Not fade away)
Not fade away, oh, not fade away
Not fade away (Not fade away)
Say not fade away, say not fade away
Not fade away (Not fade away)

[Chorus 1]
Truckin', got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

[Verse 1]
Now, arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

[Chorus 2]
Dallas, got a soft machine
Houston, too close to New Orleans
New York got the ways and means
But just won't let you be, no, no

[Verse 2]
Most of the cats you meet on the streets speak of true love
And most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
And one of these days they know they better get goin'
Out of thе door and down to the street all alone

[Chorus 3]
Truckin', like thе do-dah man
Once told me "You've got to play your hand"
And sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay 'em down

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Verse 3]
See, what in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She's lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Hey, livin' on reds and vitamin C and cocaine
All her friend can say is "Ain't it a shame"

[Chorus 4]
Truckin', up to Buffalo
I've been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
It takes time, you pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

[Verse 4]
Hey, sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Hey, got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
Well, I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

[Chorus 5]
Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowling pin
And knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be, no, no, no

[Verse 5]
You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
Well, I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Right out of the door and light out and look all around

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Outro]
Truckin', I'ma goin' home
Whoa whoa baby, back where I belong
And back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Get back
Get back truckin' on
Get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Ah, get back truckin' on
Ah Lord, get back truckin' on
Ah Lord, get back truckin' on
Ah

[Instrumental]

(Thank you.) Thank you, folks. Thanks a whole lot. We appreciate it, really. (Alright, woo.) Yes, and now, ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to perform a little ditty from our newest album, at your record stores currently

[Lady with a Fan]

[Verse 1]
Let my inspiration flow
In token rhyme suggesting rhythm
That will not forsake me
'Til my tale is told and done

While the firelight's aglow
Strange shadows from the flames will grow
'Til things we've never seen
Will seem familiar

Shadows of a sailor forming
Winds both foul and fair all swarm
Down in Carlisle, he loved a lady
Many years ago

Here beside him stands a man
A soldier from the looks of him
Who came through many fights
But lost at love
While the storyteller speaks
A door within the fire creaks
Suddenly flies open
And a girl is standing there

Eyes alight with glowing hair
All that fancy paints as fair
She takes her fan and throws it
In the lion's den

"Which of you to gain me, tell
Will risk uncertain pains of hell?
I will not forgive you
If you will not take the chance"

The sailor gave at least a try
The soldier being much too wise
Strategy was his strength
And not disaster

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
The sailor coming out again
The lady fairly leapt at him
That's how it stands today
You decide if he was wise
The storyteller makes no choice
Soon you will not hear his voice
His job is to shed light
Not to master

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Since the end is never told
We pay the teller off in gold
In hopes he will come back
But he cannot be bought or sold

[Terrapin Station]

[Verse]
Inspiration move me brightly
Light the song with sense and color
Hold away despair
More than this I will not ask
Faced with mysteries dark and vast
Statements just seem vain at last
Some rise, some fall, some climb
To get to Terrapin

Counting stars by candlelight
All are dim but one is bright:
The spiral light of Venus
Rising first and shining best
Oh, from the northwest corner
Of a brand-new crescent moon
Crickets and cicadas sing
A rare and different tune

[Outro]
Terrapin Station
In the shadow of the moon
Terrapin Station
And I know we'll be there soon
Terrapin - I can't figure out
Terrapin - If it's the end or beginning
Terrapin - But the train's put its brakes on
Terrapin - And the whistle is screaming: Terrapin

[Instrumental]

Thanks a lot. Thank you. Good night

[Intro]
I got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed
When the world gives you a raw deal
Sets you off 'til you scream, "Piss off, screw you"
When it talks to you like you don't belong
Or tells you you're in the wrong field
When something's in your mitochondrial
'Cause it latched on to you, like—

[Verse 1]
Knock knock, let the devil in
Manevolent as I've ever been, head is spinnin'
This medicine's screamin', "L-L-L-Let us in"
L-L-L-Like a salad bowl, Edgar Allan Poe
Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
Liquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'
Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
Of elephant manure—hell, I meant Kahlúa
Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants
And blew up my-my-myself again
Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin
Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin
Filet-o-Fish, Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room slept on the floor of 'da motel then
Dr. Dre said, "Hell yeah"
And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man
And I know they're gonna hate
But I don't care, I barely can wait
To hit 'em with the snare and the bass
Square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced
Because they're gonna taste my—

[Chorus]
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)

[Verse 2]
I said knock knock, let the devil in
Shotgun p-p-pellets in the felt pen
Cocked, fuck around and catch a hot one
It-it's evident I'm not done
V-Venomous, the thoughts spun
Like a web and you just caught in 'em
Held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap
Beat strangler attack
So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
Eat painkiller pills, fuck up the track
Like, what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick
Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, a nut crashin'
Into ya, the back of it just mangled steel
My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill
With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
Slim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi (Gandhi)
Translation, I will probably kill us both
When I end up backin' into ya
You ain't gonna be able to tell what the fuck's happenin' to ya
When you're bit with the—

[Chorus]
Venom, adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)

[Verse 3]
I said knock knock, let the devil in
Alien, E-E-Elliott phone home
Ain't no telling when this chokehold
On this game will end, I'm loco
Became a Symbiote, so
My fangs are in your throat, ho
You're snake-bitten with my—venom
With the ballpoint pen I'm
Gun cocked, bump stock, double-aught, buckshot
Tire thumper, a garrote, tie a couple knots
Fired up and caught fire, juggernaut
Punk rock, bitch, it's goin' down like Yung Joc
'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
Why the fuck not, you only get one shot
Ate shit 'til I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner, then drank 'til I faint
And awake with a headache
And I take anything in rectangular shape
Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you
So escapin' me is impossible
I latch onto you like a—parasite
And I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too
'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
I'm the super villain Dad and Mom was losin' their marbles to
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you
And I'm the suit, so call me—

[Chorus]
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)
Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
(W-W-When they get bit with the—)
Lyrics from Snippet

[Travis Scott]
I can see the future is lookin' like we level through the sky
I can't wait to live in glory and eternal lastin' life
Won't you take the wheel? I'll recline and I'll sit still

[Verse: Frank Ocean]
Darker times
They're telling boulder heavy lies
Looks like all we've got is each other
The truth is obsolete
Remember when all I had was my mother
She didn't compromise
She could recognize
Voodoo
Our daughters and our sons
Are just candles in the sun
Voodoo
Don't let him see divide
Don't you let her see divide
Voodoo
She's got the whole wide world in her juicy fruit
He's got the whole wide world in his pants
He wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band
Then put the whole wide world on her hands
She's got the whole wide world in her hands
He's got the whole wide world in his hands

[Outro]
There's somethin' about you
I can't believe I'm even talking to you, tellin' you this right now
You're special
I wish you could see what I see

[Verse 1]
Turn down the lights
Turn down the bed
Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me
Tell me no lies
Just hold me close
Don't patronize
Don't patronize me

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't

[Verse 2]
I'll close my eyes
Then I won't see
The love you don't feel when you're holding me
Morning will come
And I'll do what's right
Just give me 'til then to give up this fight
And I’ll give up this fight

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and I'll feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't

[Intro: Pharrell Williams]
Yo
Yo Usher
I'm trying find her man
I have no idea who she is
Could you help
Cool

[Chorus: Usher]
Wifey, where are you?
Wifey, where are you?
Wifey, where are you?
'Cause here I am

[Verse: Usher]
Mother told me
Don't look for love
You will not find it
Be patient babe
For now my eyes I'm closing
I guess I have to wait
Late at night thinking of her
And I know it don't sound right
I don't know what she looks like
But she's my baby
Will holla back
Will be thruth
Just to show her the skylights
I promise to be her sunlight
Until my dying day

[Chorus: Usher]
Wifеy, where are you?
Wifеy, where are you?
Wifey, where are you?
'Cause here I am

[Pharrell]
So maybe u think I'm going out of my mind now
Or maybe my mind is going out of me
For now my eyes are closed but wait
How am I to see

[Verse: Usher]
Late at night thinking of her
And I know it don't sound right
I don't know what she looks like
But she's my baby
Will holla back
Will be thruth
Just to show her the skylights
I promise to be her sunlight
Until my dying day

[Chorus: Usher]
Wifey, where are you?
Wifey, where are you?
Wifey, where are you?
'Cause here I am
Late at night thinking of her
And I know it don't sound right
I don't know what she looks like
But she's my baby
Will holla back
Will be thruth
Just to show her the skylights
I promise to be her sunlight
Until my dying day

[Pharrell]
I send my prayers about you to heaven
Did you get them

You probably don't want to move
I'm begging
Believe me baby

[Chorus: Usher]
Wifey, where are you?
Wifey, where are you?
Wifey, where are you?
'Cause here I am
Wifey, where are you?
Wifey, where are you?
Wifey, where are you?
'Cause here I am

[Outro: Pharrell Williams]
Yo, yo Usher
I'm trying find her man
I have no idea who she is
Wifey, where are you?
Wifey, where are you?
Wifey, where are you?
Wifey, where are you?

[Verse 1]
I wish you gave me a reason
That you were better at leavin'
That you got your kicks from seein' me low
I always let the good ones go

[Pre-Chorus]
And baby, you couldn't have loved me any better
But doin' this is all that I've known ever
I want the bad ones, 'cause they're all I know
I always let the good ones go

[Chorus]
I always let the good ones
Go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I let the good ones
Go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I let the good ones go

[Verse 2]
Let you down easy, I'm tryin'
'Cause you're everything
I've spent my whole life fightin'
So when I walk away, it's not your fault
I always let the good ones go

[Pre-Chorus]
And baby, you couldn't have loved me any better
But doin' this is all that I've known ever
I want the bad ones 'cause they're all I know
I always let the good ones go

[Chorus]
I always let the good ones
Go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I let the good ones
Go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I let the good ones
Go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(Oh, oh)
I let the good ones
Go-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Go

[Outro]
And baby, you couldn't have loved me any better
But doin' this is all that I've known ever
I want the bad ones 'cause they're all I know
I always let the good ones go
Oo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

I let the good ones go
Oh, oh
I let the good ones go
Oo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh
I let the good ones go
Oo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I always let the good ones go

[Verse 1]
Well, oh, they might wear classic Reeboks
Or knackered Converse, or tracky bottoms tucked in socks
But all of that's what the point is not
The point's that there in't no romance around there
And there's the truth that they can't see
They'd probably like to throw a punch at me
And if you could only see them then you would agree
Agree that there in't no romance around there

[Chorus]
You know? Oh, it's a funny thing, you know
We'll tell 'em if you like, we'll tell 'em all tonight
They'll never listen, 'cause their minds arе made up
And 'course it's all okay to carry on that way

[Verse 2]
'Cause ovеr there there's broken bones
There's only music so that there's new ringtones
And it dun't take no Sherlock Holmes
To see it's a little different around here
Don't get me wrong though, there's boys in bands
And kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands
And just 'cause he's had a couple of cans
He thinks it's all right to act like a dickhead

[Chorus]
Don't you know? Oh, it's a funny thing, you know
We'll tell 'em if you like, we'll tell 'em all tonight
They'll never listen, 'cause their minds are made up
And course it's all okay to carry on that way

[Bridge]
But I said no, oh no
Oh, you won't get me to go
Not anywhere, said anywhere
No, I won't go
Oh, no, no

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Well over there, there's friends of mine
What can I say? I've known 'em for a long long time
And yeah they might overstep the line
But you just cannot get angry in the same way
No, not in the same way
Well, not in the same way
Oh no, oh no, no

[Intro]
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Now Ziggy played guitar
Jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And The Spiders from Mars
He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's band

[Verse 2]
Ziggy really sang
Screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
He could kill 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
He came on so loaded, man
Well hung, snow white tan

[Chorus 1]
So where were the spidеrs
While the fly tried to brеak our bones?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?
Oh

[Verse 3]
Ziggy played for time
Jiving us that we were voodoo
The kids were just crass
He was The Nazz
With God-given ass
He took it all too far
But boy, could he play guitar

[Chorus 2]
Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind (ah)
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed the man
I had to break up the band

[Bridge]
Oh yeah
Ooh

[Outro]
Ziggy played guitar

[Verse 1]
Fake tales of San Francisco
Echo through the room
More point to a wedding disco
Without a bride or groom
And there's a super cool band, yeah
With their trilbies and their glasses of white wine
And all the weekend rockstars are in the toilets
Practicing their lines

[Chorus]
I don't want to hear you (Kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear you, no (Kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear you (Kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear you, I don't want to hear your

[Verse 2]
Fake tales of San Francisco
Echo through the air
And there's a few bored faces at thе back, all
Wishing they weren't thеre
And as the microphone squeaks
A young girl's telephone beeps
Yeah, she's dashing for the exit
Oh, she's running for the streets outside
"Oh, you've saved me," she screams down the line
"The band weren't very good and I'm not having a nice time"

[Chorus]
I don't want to hear you (Kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear you, no (Kick me out, kick me out)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, his bird thinks it's amazing though, so all that's left
Is the proof that love's not only blind, but deaf

[Bridge]
He talks of San Francisco, he's from Hunter's Bar
I don't quite know the distance, but I'm sure that's far
Yeah, I'm sure that's pretty far
And yeah, I'd love to tell you all my problem
You're not from New York City, you're from Rotherham
So get off the bandwagon, and put down the handbook
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
Get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
Get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
Get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook, yeah

[Verse 1]
Well, now then, mardy bum
I've seen your frown and it's like looking down
The barrel of a gun, and it goes off
And out come all these words
Oh, there's a very pleasant side to you
A side I much prefer

[Chorus]
It's one that laughs and jokes around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
To get things off the ground
And it was up, up, and away
Ah, but it's reight hard to remember that
On a day like today
When you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on

[Verse 2]
Well, now then mardy bum
Oh, I'm in trouble again, aren't I?
I thought as much
'Cause you turned over there
Pulling that silent disappointment face
The one that I can't bear

[Chorus]
Can't we, laugh and joke around?
Remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
To get things off the ground
And it was up, up, and away
Ah, but it's reight hard to remember that
On a day like today
When you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on

[Bridge]
And yeah, I'm sorry I was late
But I missed the train and then the traffic was a state
And I can't be arsed to carry on in this debate that reoccurs
Oh, when you say I don't care
But, of course I do, yeah, I clearly do

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
So laugh and joke around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
To get things off the ground
And it was up, up, and away
But still it's reight hard to remember that
On a day like today
When you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on

[Verse 1]
Stop making the eyes at me
I'll stop making the eyes at you
What it is that surprises me
Is that I don’t really want you to

[Pre-Chorus]
And your shoulders are frozen (Cold as the night)
Oh, but you're an explosion (You're dynamite)
Your name isn’t Rio, but I don't care for sand
And lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang-oh

[Chorus]
I bet that you look good on the dancefloor
I don't know if you're looking for romance or
I don't know what you're looking for
Well, I bet that you look good on the dancefloor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
Well, from 1984

[Verse 2]
I wish you'd stop ignoring me
Because it's sending me to despair
Without a sound, yeah, you’re calling me
And I don’t think it's very fair

[Pre-Chorus]
That your shoulders are frozen (Cold as the night)
Oh, but you’re an explosion (You're dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand
And lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang-oh

[Chorus]
I bet that you look good on the dancefloor
I don’t know if you're looking for romance or
I don't know what you're looking for
Well, I bet that you look good on the dancefloor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
Well, from 1984

[Bridge]
Oh well, there in't no love
No Montagues or Capulets
Just banging tunes and DJ sets and
Dirty dancefloors and dreams of naughtiness

[Chorus]
Well, I bet that you look good on the dancefloor
I don't know if you're looking for romance or
I don't know what you're looking for
I said, I bet that you look good on the dancefloor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
Well, from 1984

[Verse 1]
Won't somebody let me out?
Don't wanna stick around no more
I'm sick of lookin' at you strange
I'm sick of stickin' to the floor

[Chorus]
Not one of you has got an ounce of style in ya
Said, not one of you, got an ounce of style

[Verse 2]
Well, fuck it all and break your nose
They keep on pushin' you around
They keep on steppin' on your toes
And pick you up when you fall down

[Chorus]
Not one of you has got an ounce of style in ya
Said, not one of you, no

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Not one of you has got an ounce of style in ya
Said, not one of you, no

[Verse 1]
There ain't no gold in this river
That I've been washin' my hands in forever
I know there is hope in these waters
But I can't bring myself to swim
When I am drowning in this silence
Baby, let me in

[Chorus]
Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

[Verse 2]
There ain't no room for things to change
When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
You can't deny how hard I've tried
I changed who I was to put you both first
But now I give up

[Chorus]
Go easy on mе, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel thе world around me
Had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me

[Bridge]
I had good intentions
And the highest hopes
But I know right now
It probably doesn't even show

[Chorus]
Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
I didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose what I chose to do
So go easy on me
Fool that I am
For falling in love with you
And a fool that I am, oh
For thinking you loved me too

You took my heart
And then played the part of little coquette
All of my dreams, they just disappeared
Like the smoke from a cigarette, oh

Fool that I am
For hoping you'd understand
And thinking you would listen too, oh
Oh, the things... the things I had planned

But we couldn't see eye to eye
So, darling, darling, darling, this is goodbye
Do I still care? Fool that I am
But I still care, fool that I am

Who's Bad?
Cell phone says your name
But I don't even hear it ring
The July in winter and September spring
Where way up north is the warmer weather

So together we take the call
And we hold the line through the static sprawl
Though the distances traveled are expanding still
We meet in dreams by the lilac river

Oh, giver of empathy
It is a gift so bitter that you brought to me
'Cause I feel what he's feeling and I know that he's free
And the freedom he takes is the earthly burden

Please deliver his angel eyes
On the wings of moths and dragonflies
Through the morning and evening his sun set my sunrise
Let them come to me like the breath I'm taking
You say it's all in my head
And the things I think just don’t make sense
So where you been then? Don't go all coy
Don't turn it round on me like it’s my fault

See I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shoots me each and every time

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

These days, when I see you
You make it look like I'm see-through
Do tell me why you waste our time
When your heart ain't admitting you're not satisfied

You know I know just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too
When you grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

Time and time again I'll play the role of fools (just for you)
Even in the daylight when you're dreaming (I'm close to you)
Try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find
Even though I do know how you play

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You say it's all in my head
And the things I think just don't make sense
So where you been then? Don't go all coy
Don't turn it round on me like it's my fault

See I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shoots me each and every time

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

These days, when I see you
You make it look like I'm see-through
Do tell mе why you waste our time
When your hеart ain't admitting you're not satisfied

You know I know just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too
When you grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

Time and time again I'll play the role of fools (just for you)
Even in the daylight when you're dreaming (I'm close to you)

Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You say it's all in my head
And the things I think just don't make sense
So where you been then? Don't go all coy
Don't turn it round on me like it's my fault

See I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shoots me each and every time

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

These days, when I see you
You make it look like I'm see-through

Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

[Verse 1]
Flowers come in the spring
All the love I can bring
Bring it for my lady
All I can do
You know
You know it's for my lady

[Chorus]
I love her so
I love to grow
With my lady
My lady

[Verse 2]
Fallin' in love
Summer winds again
Together with my lady
Love the life I live
Live the life that I love
Live it with my lady

[Chorus]
I love her so
I let her know
She's a lady
Yes, my lady

[Outro]
Yes, I'm in love
Love, in love, in love, in love with my lady
She knows I'm in love
Love, in love, in love, in love with my lady
I'm thinking 'bout a-this whole world

Late at night I think about the love of this whole world
Full of different people everywhere
And when I go anywhere
I see love, I see love, I see love

When girls gettin' mad at boys and go
Many times they're just putting on a show
But when they leave you wait alone

You are there like everywhere like everyone you see
Happy 'cause you're living and you're free
Ooh, here comes another day
For your love
(I'm thinking 'bout a-this whole world)
(A-this whole world)
Ooh

Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[False Start]

[Verse 1]
In the next world war
A jackknifed juggernaut
I am born again
In the neon sign
Scrolling up and down
I am born again

[Chorus]
In an interstellar burst
I'm back to save the universe

[Verse 2]
In a deep, deep sleep
Of the innocent
I am born again
In a fast German car
I'm amazed that I survived
An airbag saved my life

[Chorus]
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe, yeah

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
An interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
Well an empty heart is like an empty life
You know an empty heart is like a empty life
Well, it makes you feel like you wanna die
Like you wanna die
Like you wanna die
Like you wanna die
You gotta die

Well you've been my lover for a long long time
Well you've been my lover for a long long time
Well you left me here, trying to spend my time
Spend my time
Spend my time
Spend my time

Well an empty heart is like an empty life
You know an empty heart is like a empty life
Well, it makes you feel like you wanna die
Like you wanna die
Like you wanna die
Like you wanna die
You gotta die
Let my inspiration flow, in token rhyme suggesting rhythm
That will not forsake me, till my tale is told and done
While the fire lights aglow, strange shadows from the flames will grow
Till things we've never seen will seem familiar

Shadows of a sailor forming winds both foul and fair, all swarm
Down in Carlisle he loved a lady many years ago
Here beside him stands a man, a soldier by the looks of him
Who came through many fights, but lost at love

While the story teller speaks, a door within the fire creaks
Suddenly flies open, and a girl is standing there
Eyes alight, with glowing hair, all that fancy paints as fair
She takes her fan and throws it in the lion's den

Which of you to gain me, tell, will risk uncertain pains of hell?
I will not forgive you if you will not take the chance
The sailor gave at least a try; the soldier, being much too wise
Strategy was his strength, and not disaster

The sailor, coming out again, the lady fairly leapt at him
That's how it stands today. You decide if he was wise
The story teller makes no choice, soon you will not hear his voice
His job is to shed light, and not to master
Since the end is never told we pay the teller off in gold
In hopes he will come back, but he cannot be bought or sold
Went to see the captain, strangest I could find
Laid my proposition down, laid it on the line
I won't slave for beggar's pay, likewise gold and jewels
But I would slave to learn the way to sink your ship of fools

Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
But now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

Saw your first ship sink and drown from rocking of the boat
And all that could not sink or swim were just left there to float
I won't leave you drifting down but whoa it makes me wild
With thirty years upon my head to have you call me child

Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
But now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

The bottles stand as empty now, as they were filled before
Time there was and plenty, but from that cup no more
Though I could not caution all, I still might warn a few
Don't lend your hand to raise no flag atop no ship of fools
Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
But now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools
I went down to the mountain, I was drinking some wine
I looked up into heaven, lord I saw a mighty sign
Writ in fire across the heaven, plain as black and white
Get prepared, there's gonna be a party tonight

Uh huh, hey, Saturday night
One more Saturday night
Hey, Saturday night

Everybody's dancing down at the local armory
With a basement full of dynamite and live artillery
Temperature keeps rising, everybody getting high
Come the rocking stroke of midnight, the whole place is gonna fly

Uh huh, hey, Saturday night
Onе more Saturday night
Hey, Saturday night

I turn on Channel Six, thе President comes on the news
Says I got no satisfaction, that's why I sing the blues
His wife says don't get crazy, Lord you know what to do
Just crank that old Victrola, put on your rocking shoes
Uh huh, hey, Saturday night
One more Saturday night
Hey, Saturday night

Then God way up in heaven, for whatever it was worth
Thought he'd have a big old party, thought he'd call it planet earth
Don't worry about tomorrow, Lord, you'll know it when it comes
When the rocking, rolling music meets the rising, shining sun

Uh huh, hey, Saturday night
One more Saturday night
Hey, Saturday night
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you'd better watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

This old engine makes it on time
Leaves Central Station 'bout a quarter to nine
Hits River Junction at seventeen to
At a quarter to ten you know it's travelling again

Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you'd better watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

Trouble ahead, the lady in red
Take my advice you'd be bеtter off dead
Switchman's sleeping, train Hundred and Two
Is on thе wrong track and headed for you

Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you'd better watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Trouble with you is the trouble with me
Got two good eyes but we still don't see
Come round the bend, you know it's the end
The fireman screams and the engine just gleams

Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you'd better watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Truckin' got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin' like the doodah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, Detroit and its all the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

Dallas got a soft machine
Houston too close to New Orleans
New York got the ways and means
But just won't let you be

Most of the cats that you meet on the street speak of true love
Most of the time they're sitting and crying at home
One of these days they know they gotta get going
Out of the door and down to the street all alone

Truckin' likе the doodah man
Once told me "Gotta play your hand
Somеtimes the cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay them down"
Sometimes the lights all shining on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long strange trip it's been

What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle you know she isn't the same
Living on reds and vitamin C and cocaine
All her friends can say is ain't it a shame

Truckin' up to Buffalo
Been thinking you got to mellow slow
Takes time, you pick a place to go
Just keep truckin' on

Sitting and staring out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
Like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant I guess you're gonna come in

Busted down on Bourbon Street
Set up like a bowling pin
Knocked down, it gets to wearing thin
They just won't let you be

You're sick of hanging around, you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelling you want to settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for trying
Get out of the door, light out and look all around
Sometimes the lights all shining on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long strange trip it's been

Truckin' I'm a going home
Whoa, whoa, baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on

[Intro]
Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like home

[Chorus]
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I want to take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

[Verse 1]
I hear your voice
It's like an angel sighing
I have no choice
I hear your voice
Feels like flying
I close my eyes
Oh God, I think I'm falling
Out of the sky
I close my eyes
Heaven, hеlp me

[Chorus]
When you call my name
It's likе a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I want to take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

[Verse 2]
Like a child
You whisper softly to me
You're in control
Just like a child
Now I'm dancing
It's like a dream
No end and no beginning
You're here with me
It's like a dream
Let the choir sing

[Chorus]
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there
Come on, Lisbon, put your hands together!

[Chorus]
Just like a prayer
Your voice can take me there
Just like a muse to me
You are a mystery
Just like a dream
You are not what you seem
Just like a prayer, no choice
Your voice can take me there

[Bridge]
(Just like a prayer, I'll take you there)
Come on, Munchie, sing it for the people
(It's like a dream to me) Mmmm...
(Just like a prayer, I'll take you there) And I'll take you there
(It's like a dream to me) Oh whoa
(Just like a prayer, I'll take you there) Can I take you there?
(It's like a dream to me)
(Just like a prayer, I'll take you there)
(It's like a dream to me) To me, yeah

[Chorus]
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there
When you call my name
It's like a little prayer
I'm down on my knees
I wanna take you there
In the midnight hour
I can feel your power
Just like a prayer
You know I'll take you there

[Outro]
Life is a mystery
Everyone must stand alone
I hear you call my name
And it feels like...
Home
Thank you

Every color Girbauds, every color

Every summer was cold

[Chorus: CyHi The Prynce]
IPhone tapped by Asians, huh?
They gon’ try to say that’s racist, huh?
Thank you

I'm thinking about this whole world

Late at night I think about the love of this whole world
Lots of lovely people everywhere
And when I go anywhere
I see love, I see love, I see love

When girls get mad at boys and go
Many times they're just putting on a show
But when they leave you wait alone

You are there like everywhere like everyone you see
Happy 'cause you're living and you'rе free
Now here comes anothеr day
For your love, for your love, for your love
(I'm thinking about this whole world)

Late at night I think about the love of this whole world
Lots of lovely people everywhere
Thank you

[Spoken]
Too much of my guitar

In the timbers of Fennario the wolves are running round
The winter was so hard and cold, froze ten feet 'neath the ground

Don't murder me, I beg of you don't murder me
Please don't murder me

I sat down to my supper, 'twas a bottle of red whiskey
I said my prayers and went to bed, that's the last they saw of me

Don't murder me, I beg of you don't murder me
Please don't murder me

When I awoke, thе dire wolf, six hundred pounds of sin
Was grinning at my window, all I said was "Come on in"

Don't murdеr me, I beg of you don't murder me
Please don't murder me
The wolf came in, I got my cards, we sat down for a game
I cut my deck to the queen of spades but the cards were all the same

Don't murder me, I beg of you don't murder me, no
Please don't murder me, don't murder me

In the back-wash of Fennario, the black and bloody mire
The dire wolf collects his due while the boys sing 'round the fire

Don't murder me, I beg of you don't murder me
Please don't murder me

Don't murder me, I beg of you don't murder me
Please don't murder me

Don't murder me, I beg of you don't murder me
Please don't murder me

No-no-no, don't murder me, I beg of you don't murder me
Please don't murder me

Don't murder me, I beg of you don't murder me
Please don't murder me
Please don't murder me
Now I don't know but I've been told
It's hard to run with the weight of gold
Other hand I heard it said
It's just as hard with the weight of lead

Who can deny? Who can deny?
It's not just a change in style
One step done and another begun
And I wonder how many miles?

I spent a little time on the mountain
Spent a little time on the hill
Things went down, we don't understand
But I think in time we will

Now I don't know but I was told
In the heat of the sun a man died of cold
Do we keep on coming or stand and wait
With the sun so dark and the hour so late?

You can't overlook the lack Jack
Of any othеr highway to ride
It's got no signs or dividing lines
And very fеw rules to guide
I spent a little time on the mountain
Spent a little time on the hill
I saw things getting out of hand
I guess they always will

Now, I don't know but I've been told
If the horse don't pull, you got to carry the load
I don't know whose back's that strong
Maybe find out before too long

One way or another
One way or another
One way or another
This darkness got to give

One way or another
One way or another
One way or another
This darkness got to give
Please don't dominate the rap, Jack
If you got nothing new to say
If you please, don't back up the track
This train's got to run today

I spent a little time in the mountain
Spent a little time on the hill
I heard some say "better run away"
Others say "better stand still"

Now, I don't know but I've been told
It's hard to run with the weight of gold
Other hand I heard it said
It's just as hard with the weight of lead

Who can deny? Who can deny?
It's not just a change in style
One step done and another begun
And I wonder how many miles?

I spent a little time on the mountain
Spent a little time on the hill
Things went down, we don't understand

Do we keep on coming or stand and wait
With the sun so dark and the hour so late?

You can't overlook the lack Jack
Of any other highway to ride
It's got no signs or dividing lines
And very few rules to guide

I spent a little time on the mountain
Spent a little time on the hill
I saw things getting out of hand
I guess they always will

Now, I don't know but I've been told
If the horse don't pull, you got to carry the load

One way or another

This darkness got to give
All I wanna do
Is always bring good to you
To give you all the love I can
And help you in whatever you do

Sure as the sun will come around again to start off another day
You can be sure that in my heart and soul I'll love you in every way

All I wanna do
Is bring happiness to you
I hope it makes you happy to know
My love’s with you wherever you go

Ooh, when I sit and close my eyes
A gentle thought comes in my mind

My love is burning brightly (burning brightly)
Like moon and stars shine nightly

All I wanna do
All I wanna do
All I wanna do
All I wanna do
Ooh, let these little words of love
Come romance and light your way

My love is burning brightly (burning brightly)
Like moon and stars shinе nightly

All I wanna do
(If you get lonely in the night I'd comе and be with you)
All I wanna do
All I wanna do
(My love is burning brightly)
(If you get lonely in the night I'd come and be with you)
All I wanna do
(Like moon and stars shine nightly)
All I wanna do
(My love is burning brightly)
(If you get lonely in the night I’d come and be with you)
All I wanna do
(Like moon and stars shine nightly)
All I wanna do
(My love is burning brightly)
(If you get lonely in the night I'd come and be with you)
All I wanna do
(Like moon and stars shine nightly)
All I wanna do
(My love is burning brightly)
(If you get lonely in the night I'd come and be with you)
All I wanna do
(Like moon and stars shine nightly)

[Chorus]
It doesn't matter if I want to go somewhere new
At the end of the day, I have no choice
It wouldn't matter that I had to break it with you
Going over and over brings no joy

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
It doesn't matter if I want to go somewhere new
At the end of the day, I have no choice
And if you're telling me that I've got so much to lose
All the talking about it, it's all noise

[Refrain]
Nice and short
There must be something more
Life's a chore
What are wе living for?

[Verse 1]
Let it out
I can see it now
Tryin' to hold down
I hear it now

[Bridge]
All the constants in your futurе bore you
Kinda makes your mind up for you
Knowing just what lies before you
Gives you no surprise

[Chorus]
It doesn't matter if I want to go somewhere new
At the end of the day, I have no choice
It wouldn't matter that I had to break it with you
Going over and over brings no joy

[Guitar Solo]

[Refrain]
Nice and short
There must be something more
Life's a chore
What are we living for?

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Do you remember we were standing here a year ago?
Our minds were racing and time went slow
If there was trouble in the world, we didn't know
If we had a care, it didn't show
Now I worry our horizon's been nothing new
'Cause I get this feeling, maybe you get it too
We're on a rollercoaster stuck on its loop-de-loop
'Cause what we did one day on a whim has slowly become all we do

[Refrain]
All we do
And now it's all we live for
Now it's all we live for
And now it's all we live for
Might be what we die for
Oh

[Pre-Chorus]
But it's okay
I think I know a way
It's s-, it's so clear
Why don't we just say, "One more year"?
One more year
One more year
Oh-oh-ah
One more year

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I never wanted any other way to spend our lives
I know we promised we'd be doing this until we die
Now I fear we might
I never wanted any other way to spend our lives
I know we promised we'd be doing this until we die
Now I fear we might
Ooh, now I fear we might
I know we promised
I know we promised we'd be doing this until we die
Now I fear we might

[Refrain]
Now it's all we live for
Now it's all we live for
And now we're shining
Nobody beside me
Future is inside you
Oh

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Do you remember we were standing here a year ago?
Our minds were racing and time went slow
If there was trouble in the world, we didn't know

'Cause I get this feeling and maybe you get it too

Now it's all we live for
Now it's all we live for
It might be what we die for
'Cause now we're shining
Somebody guide me
Future is inside you

[Outro]
One more year
One more year

[Chorus]
It's always drive straight, don't be late
'Cause time waits for no one
I should be flyin' straight, with no delay
'Cause time takes from everyone, everyone

[Bridge]
Lay down
Lay down

[Chorus]
It's always drive straight, don't be late
'Cause time waits for no one
I should be flyin' straight, with no delay
'Cause time takes from everyone, everyone
It's always drive straight, don't be late
'Cause time waits for no one
I should be flyin' straight, with no delay
'Cause time takes from everyone, everyone
It's always drive straight, don't be late
'Cause time waits for no one
I should be flyin' straight, with no delay
'Cause time takes from everyone, everyone
It's always drive straight, don't be late
'Cause time waits for no one
I should be flyin' straight, with no delay
'Cause time takes from everyone, everyone
It's always drive straight, don't be late
'Cause time waits for no one
I should be flyin' straight, with no delay

Please don't dominate the rap, Jack

(I dropped my dog)
I woke one morning about 3AM
(In my solution)
Remembering the missing link to a formula I stumbled upon years before
(He looked so different)
Suddenly I called my faithful dog to my side and from
(In my solution)
A batch produced a sample of the formula, offering it to my dear pet

I knew I found
My peace solution
My instant aid
To evolution

(What have I done)
The affect on my faithful animal was fascinating!
(With my solution)
His former disposition to chase the cat, the rabbits and other sundry animals
(He walked so gently)
Of the estatе had gone. Instead, he walkеd gently through the dark
(He would harm no one)
And dead forest, a look of peace and calm about him
I knew i must spread the formula to all mankind
Success had come
To my solution
My instant aid
To evolution
What have I done
With my soluuuu...

(Damsel)
One night, walking the streets near my laboratory
(Outside my castle)
I discovered a beautiful damsel with dark flowing hair
(She looked so fair)
And conversed her to be a part of my experiment. She lay upon the table
(Her dark brown hair)
Looking so peaceful as I administered my solution
Oh, her beauty was inconceivable!

What have I done
With my solution
My instant aid
To my solution

Oh, my solution
Sweet peace solution
Were I to lose it?
I would have loved it
Deciding to spread my solution around the world
I must have had to leave the laboratory for a little while
But, when I returned, she was gone! The damsel was gone!
I mean, not gone yet, but the heart meter said she was almost gone
She was dying! What could I do? She was almost dead!

There's the meter
The meter has now read even
The line has evened out
And you know what that means

Play it
Lyrics From Snippet

[Intro: Kanye West & Bri Babineaux]
(But Lord, I need you to wrap your arms around me)
Christ Lord we need you now more than ever
(Lord, I need you to wrap your arms around me)
You working for God or are you working for the Devil?
(Lord, I need you to wrap your arms around me)
It’s so bad if only you knew it
(Lord, I need you to wrap your arms around me)
It’s so bad like something would do it
(And tell me everything's gonna be alright, oh)
Oh, we need you now more than ever, Lord
(Wheezy outta here)

Honey, I want you

Father, hold me close
Don't let me down
I know you won't

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I chose not to be a slave
Dropped the Wave Runners, now we run the wave

Like you ain't had 'em, good stats and all that
Nobody gon' ruin me
I just called my wife up, let's get Hoover free
I put all my icе up and my Louis V
I just copped my momma crib, I'm back over East
Let mе get your ear like Holyfield
From the home of Soldier Field
Coming home, that's how a soldier feels
All that killing over, that's just overkill

Jimmy, Jimmy

[Verse 1]
1951
Mr. and Mrs. Jarain Bones gave birth to a 7 pounds, 4 ouch, baby named Jimmy
Handsome little devil
Jimmy would grow up fast, loving to add, subtract, multiply
In other words, Jimmy was real good with numbers
So Jimmy outgrew home before the average kid was grown ​
Ya, dig what I'm talking about?
So, as Jimmy grew old and got on his own
He went from state to state
County to county, city to city, runnin’ numbers
But there was one thing that Jimmy always preached
And that was black power, black unit, soul power
So, Jimmy, I know you're up there looking down and smiling
Just wanna let you know
That your legend lives on, and on, and on (Jimmy)
Jimmy Bones, what a cool cat to know, yeah (Jimmy)

[Chorus]
Jimmy, Jimmy

[Verse 2]
So if you'll look up at the sky, is sort of cloudy
And it looks like it’s gon' rain
Then all of a sudden, thе sun appears out of nowhere
You can bеlieve, that Jimmy had his hands on that baby
I was once told that Martin Luther King had a dream
I know for sure that Jimmy Bones had a plan
Jimmy was the man, with the master plan
And um, as I look back, 20 years since his death
Jimmy, I know you're smiling, you're proud of everything that's going down
Cause we manage to take our lives in the right step
Black folks pushin' together, living together, working together
Education, teaching, It's all love
Got to give a shout out to my main man, Jimmy Bones
Without you, there's no me
Jimmy, your legend lives on, yeah (Jimmy)
Jimmy Bones, baby

[Chorus]
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy

[Intro]
Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I gonna be a star?

[Verse 1]
I tried to be a boy
I tried to be a girl
I tried to be a mess
I tried to be the best
I guess I did it wrong
That's why I wrote this song
This type of modern life, is it for me?
This type of modern life, is it for free?

[Verse 2]
So, I went into a bar
Looking for sympathy
A little company
I tried to find a friend
It's more easily said
It's always been the same
This type of modern life, isn't for me
This type of modern life, isn't for free

[Chorus]
American Life (American Life)
I live the American Dream (American Dream)
You are the best thing I've seen
You are not just a dream (American Life)

[Verse 3]
I tried to stay ahead
I tried to stay on top
I tried to play the part
But somehow I forgot
Just what I did it for
And why I wanted more
This type of modern life, is it for me?
This type of modern life, is it for free?

[Refrain]
Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I gonna be a star?

[Chorus]
American Life (American Life)
I live the American Dream (American Dream)
You are the best thing I've seen
You are not just a dream (American Life)
Oh yeah, he tried to fuck us over
Oh yeah, but he won't fuck me up, oh yeah

[Refrain]
Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I gonna be a star?

[Break]
A- fuck it
A- fuck it
A- fuck it
A- fuck it

[Verse 5]
I'm drinking a soy latte
I get a double shoté
It goes right through my body, and you know I'm satisfied
I drive my Mini Cooper, and I'm feeling super-dooper
Yo, they tell I'm a trooper, and you know I'm satisfied
I do yoga and pilates, room is full of hotties
So I'm checking out the bodies, and you know I'm satisfied
I'm digging on the isotopes, this metaphysics shit is dope
And if all this can give me hope, you know I'm satisfied
Lawyer, manager, agent and a chef
Three nannies, an assistant, and a driver, and a jet
A trainer, and a butler, and a bodyguard, or five
A gardener and a stylist, do you think I'm satisfied?
I'd like to express my extreme point of view
I'm not a Christian and I'm not a Jew
I'm just living out the American dream
And I just realized that nothing is what it seems

[Outro]
Do I have to change my name? (I'm Madame X)
Am I gonna be a star? (I'm Madame X)
Do I have to change my name? (I'm Madame X)
Am I gonna be a star? Fuck it
Fuck it
Fuck it
Fuck it
Fuck it

[Intro]
(Express yourself, don't repress yourself)
It's our gypsy blood
We live between life and death
Artists are here to disturb the peace

[Verse]
Madame X is a secret agent (I am Madame X)
Traveling around the world
Changing identities
Fighting for freedom (Freedom)
Bringing light to dark places (I bring light to dark places)
Madame X is a dancer (I'm a dancer)
A professor
A head of state
A housekeeper
An equestrian
A prisoner
A student
A teacher
A nun
A singer
A saint
(A whore) A whore
A spy in the house of love
I am Madame X, X, X
I am Madame X

[Outro]
The most controversial thing I have ever done
Is to stick around

[Spoken]
Ladies and gentlemen
Welcome to the World of Madame X
We want you to be present
And enjoy the journey with us
Let nothing stand between us
And don't forget
None of this is real

[Intro: Madonna]
Everybody knows the damn truth
Our nation lied, we lost respect
When we wake up, what can we do?
Get the kids ready, take them to school
Everybody knows they don’t have a chance
To get a decent job, to have a normal life
When they talk reforms, it makes me laugh
They pretend to help, it makes me laugh
I think I understand why peopl﻿e get a gun
I think I understand why we all give up
Evеry day they have a kind of victory
Blood of innocencе, spread everywhe﻿re
They say that we need love
But we need more than this

[Refrain: Tiffin Children's Choir]
We lost God control
We lost God control
We lost God control
We lost God control

[Interlude: Madonna]
This is your wake-up call
I'm like your nightmare
I'm here to start your day

[Verse 1: Madonna]
This is your wake-up call
We don’t have to fall
A new democracy
God and pornography, hey girl!
A new democracy

[Chorus: Madonna]
People think that I’m insane
The only gun is in my brain
Each new birth, it gives me hope
That’s why I don’t smoke that dope
Insane people think I am
Brain inside my only friend
Hope it gives me birth each new
That dope I don’t smoke, it’s true

[Bridge: Madonna]
Everybody knows the damn truth
Everybody knows the damn truth (Wake u﻿p)
We need to wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
We need to wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
It’s a hustle, yeah
It’s a con
It’s a hustle
It’s a con
It’s a weird kind of energy, a bizarre thing that happens to be
An abnormal fraternity, and I feel more than sympathy
We need to wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
We need to wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

[Chorus: Madonna]
Everybody knows the damn truth
Everybody knows the damn truth (Wake up)
We got to wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

[Interlude: Madonna]
A new democracy!

[Verse 2: Madonna]
Everybody knows the damn truth
Our nation lied, we’ve lost respect
When we wake up, what can we do
Get the kids ready, take them to school
Everybody knows they don’t have a chance
Get a decent job, have a normal life
When they talk reforms﻿, it makes me laugh
They pretend to help, it makes me laugh

[Refrain: Tiffin Children's Choir]
We lost God control
We lost God control
We lost God control
We lost God control
We lost God control

Let me catch my breath (Let me catch my breath)
Will we win this race? (Will we win this race?)
Swear the road is long (Swear the road is long)
And the highway listens (And the highway listens)

[The Batukadeiras Orchestra Interlude]

[Verse 2: Madonna, The Batukadeiras Orchestra]
I was up all night
I said a little prayer
Get that old man
Put him in a jail
Where he can't stop us (Where he can't stop us)
Where he can't hurt us (Where he can't hurt us)
We will stand tall (We will stand tall)
Underneath this tree (Underneath this tree)
'Cause it's a—

But will we taste the freedom (But will we taste the freedom)
In the right way (In the right way)
Will we stand together? (Will we stand together?)
It's a new day (It's a new day)
So don't judge a human (So don't judge a human)
'Til you're in their shoes ('Til you're in their shoes)
'Cause if you have a dream ('Cause if you have a dream)
Then you can't stop us (Then you can't stop us)

[Bridge: Madonna, The Batukadeiras Orchestra]
Sing "Hallelujah" (Sing "Hallelujah")
Say "Amen" (Say "Amen")
Say "Hallelujah" (Say "Hallelujah")
And say "Amen" (And say "Amen")
I say "Oh, yeah" (I say "Oh, yeah")

[The Batukadeiras Orchestra Outro]

[Spoken]
Ladies and gentlemen
The Batukadeira Orchestra from Cabo Verde, give it up!

[Verse 1]
It's a beautiful life, but I'm not concerned
It's a beautiful dream, but a dream is earned
I can dress like a boy, I can dress like a girl
Keep your beautiful words, 'cause I'm not concerned

[Chorus]
'Cause your world is such a shame
'Cause your world's obsessed with fame
'Cause your world's in so much pain
'Cause your world is, 'cause your world is
Up in flames

[Verse 2]
It's a beautiful plan (Hmm), but I'm not concerned (Oh, yeah)
It's a beautiful game (Hmm) that I never learned
People tell me to shut my mouth (Shut your mouth), that I might get burned
Keep your beautiful lies (Hmm) 'cause I'm not concerned

[Chorus]
'Cause your world is such a shame
'Cause your world's obsessed with fame
'Cause your world's in so much pain
'Cause your world is, 'cause your world is—

[Bridge]
I will﻿ not denounce the things that I have said
I will not renounce my faith in my sweet Lord
He has chosen me to fight against the English
And I'm not afraid at all to die 'cause I believe Him
God is on my side and I'll be His bride
I am not afraid 'cause I have faith in Him
You can cut my hair and throw me in a jail cell
Say that I'm a witch and burn me at the stake
It's all a big mistake
Don't you know to doubt Him is a sin?
I won't give in

[Verse 3]
They are so naive
They think we are not aware of their crimes
We know, but we are just not ready to act
The storm isn't in the air, it's inside of us
I want to tell you about love and loneliness
But it's getting late now
Can't you hear outside of your Supreme hoodie
The wind that's beginning to howl?

[Spoken]
Traitor!
Fucking traitor!
I fought for you! Ah!
Death, death to the patriarchy!

[Outro]
It's a beautiful life
Brûle en enfer!
Va te faire foutre

[Refrain]
Express yourself, don't repress yourself
Express yourself, don't repress yourself
Express yourself, don't repress yourself
Express yourself, don't repress yourself
Express yourself, don't repress yourself

[Verse 1]
You wouldn't let me say the words I longed to say
You didn't want to see life through my eyes
(Express yourself, don't repress yourself)
You tried to shove me back inside your narrow room
And silencе me with bitterness and liеs
(Express yourself, don't repress yourself)

[Pre-Chorus]
Did I say something wrong?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex
Did I stay too long?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't speak my mind

[Chorus]
And I'm not sorry (I'm not sorry)
It's human nature (It's human nature)
And I'm not sorry (I'm not sorry)
I'm not your bitch, don't hang your shit on me (It's human nature)

[Verse 2]
You punished me for telling you my fantasies
I'm breaking all the rules I didn't make
(Express yourself, don't repress yourself)
You took my words and made a trap for silly fools
You held me down and tried to make me break
(Express yourself, don't repress yourself)

[Pre-Chorus]
Did I say something true?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about sex
Did I have a point of view?
Oops, I didn't know I couldn't talk about you

[Chorus]
And I'm not sorry (I'm not sorry)
It's human nature (It's human nature)
And I'm not sorry (I'm not sorry)
I'm not your bitch, don't hang your shit on me (It's human nature)

[Refrain]
Express yourself, don't repress yourself
Express yourself, don't repress yourself
Express yourself, don't repress yourself
Express yourself, don't repress yourself
Express yourself, don't repress yourself
Express yourself, don't repress yourself

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
And I'm not sorry (I'm not sorry) But you will be
It's human nature (It's human nature)
And I'm not sorry (I'm not sorry)
I'm not your bitch, don't hang your shit on me (It's human nature)
And I'm not sorry (I'm not sorry) Come on, ladies!
We got something that we wanna say (It's human nature)
And I'm not sorry (I'm not sorry)
I'm not your bitch, don't hang your shit on me

[Outro]
Alright we're gonna breakdown now, yeah!
I'm not your bitch
I'm not your bitch
I'm not your bitch
I'm not your bitch, don't hang your shit on me
I'm not your bitch
I'm not your bitch
I'm not your bitch, come on, come on
I'm not your bitch, don't hang your shit on me

[Spoken]
Don't hang your shit on anybody!
Do you get the message?
Aren't we all on the same boat?
Remember that, if the ship goes down, we all go down together
Stella come over here
Do you have something you'd like to share with the audience?
"#TimesUp"
That's right, time's up people!
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Esther, would you like to share something with the audience tonight?
"God is a woman! What's up?"
That is highly possible
Oh Mercy James, what are you doing over there?
Think you're gonna get away without the spotlight on you?
I try to raise my children to believe that we never have to settle for the second best, ever!
We deserve only the best
Each and every one of us
So if I told you once, I told you one hundred thousand times

[Express Yourself]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real
Express yourself
You've got to make him
Express yourself
Hey hey hey hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not
I said express what she's got, oh baby, ready or not
Come on, Lisbon
Express what we've got (Oh baby, ready or not)
No, that wasn't good enough
One more time, I'll give you one more chance
Express what we've got (Oh baby, ready or not)
Not bad, I'll take it, I'll take it
Alright
We got a really big show for you tonight
We gotta get on with this, so
I'll see you ladies later at the bar!

It's everywhere that you go (Look around)
You try everything you can to escape
The pain of life that you know (Life that you know)
When all else fails and you long to be

[Verse 1]
I spent all night waitin' up
It's gon' be the last night I wait up for you
Spent a long time wakin' up
Used to think that I was not enough for you
Now I see that I'm just way too much
You got your hands full, I misunderstood
Now I see that I'm who I can trust
And you got a lot of wrong you're tryna make good

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you think I've been foolish
And you only fool me once
I guess it's shame on you
Said now, if you think I've been foolish
And you keep on tryna do it
Baby, I'ma switch the plans on you

[Chorus]
'Cause you're driving me crazy
You must think I'm crazy
Você me põe tão louca
Você pensa que eu sou louca
And I won't let you drive me cra-a-a-azy
I won't let you drive me crazy
Você não vai me pôr tão lo-o-o-ouca
Você não vai me pôr tão louca

[Verse 2]
I bent my knees for you like a prayer
My God, look at me now
Peel off my weakness, layer after layer
Nothing lеft for me to keep around
I'm a force and I won't tame, babе
Can't go through this and stay the same, babe
I've seen a lot of stranger things, babe
And I'll never look at you the same

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you think I've been foolish
And you only fool me once
I guess it's shame on you
Said now, if you think I've been foolish
And you keep on tryna do it
Baby, I'ma switch the plans on you

[Chorus]
'Cause you're driving me crazy
You must think I'm crazy
Você me põe tão louca
Você pensa que eu sou louca
And I won't let you drive me cra-a-a-azy
I won't let you drive me crazy
Você não vai me pôr tão lo-o-o-ouca
Você não vai me pôr tão louca

[Interlude]
Eu te amo
Mas não deixo você me destruir

[Bridge]
I put you on a pedestal, but statues, they can fall
Felt so safe, I let you drive me straight into the war
Paid the hell you dealt me, thought you felt me
Was never good at games, now I'll just forget your name
(Forget your name)

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you think I've been foolish
And you only fool me once
I guess it's shame on you
Said now, if you think I've been foolish
And you keep on tryna do it
Baby, I'ma switch the plans on you

[Chorus]
'Cause you're driving me crazy
You must think I'm crazy
Você me põe tão louca (Louca)
Você pensa que eu sou louca
I won't let you drive me cra-a-a-azy
I won't let you drive me crazy (Crazy)
Você não vai me pôr tão lo-o-o-ouca
Você não vai me pôr tão louca (Louca)
'Cause you're driving me crazy
You must think I'm crazy
Você me põe tão louca
Você pensa que eu sou louca

I won't let you drive me crazy
Você não vai me pôr tão lo-o-o-ouca
Você não vai me pôr tão louca

[Spoken]
Caralho!
That's the only bad word I know in Portuguese
But it works, right?
Like it says in the song
"I love you, but I won't let you destroy me"
Never let anyone destroy you

[Verse]
Welcome to my Fado club
Sit down at the bar
Have an Amarguinha
You won't go far
One, two, cha-cha-cha
One, two, cha-cha-cha
Can you do that?
One, two, cha-cha-cha
Let me hear you say
(One, two, cha-cha-cha)
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature wild and free
This is where I long to be
La Isla Bonita
And when the Samba played
The Sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
Your Portuguese lullaby
One, two, cha-cha-cha
Let me hear you say
(One, two, cha-cha-cha)
Pretty good
One, two, cha-cha-cha
(One, two, cha-cha-cha)
Now you know, Madame X
She doesn't like to stay at one place for too long
I think I'd like to go somewhere South
Somewhere hot
And sunny
Somewhere like Medellín
(One, two, cha-cha-cha)

[Spoken]
Very good
You know what they say, right?
You can't hit a moving target

[Spoken]
Let me get on with my journey

[Verse 1]
I went to the far right
Then I went to the far left
I tried to recover my center of gravity

[Chorus]
I guess I'm lost
I had to pay the cost
The thing that hurt me most
Was that I wasn't lost

[Verse 2]
I came from the Midwest
Then I went to the Far East
I tried to discover my own identity

[Chorus]
I guess I’m lost
I paid a handsome cost
The thing that hurt the most
Was that I wasn't lost
I wasn't lost

[Bridge]
No, I wasn't lost
It was a different feeling
A mix of lucidity and craziness
But I wasn't lost, you believe me
I was right, and I've got the right
To choose my own life like a full circle
Life is a circle, life is a circle
Life is a circle, life is a circle
Life is a circle, life is a circle
Life is a circle, life is a circle
Aquilo que mais magoa
É que eu não estava perdida

[Chorus]
(I guess I'm lost, guess I'm lost) I guess I'm lost (I'm lost, I'm lost)
I had to pay the cost
The thing that hurt me most (Me most, me most)
Was that I wasn't lost
I wasn't lost

[Verse]
I'm not a little girl
I'm not a man
When all the hurt inside of me comes out
You understand
You see that I'm ferocious
You see that I am weak
You see that I am silly
And pretentious
And a freak
But I don't feel too strange for you
I think when love is pure you try
To understand the reasons why
I prefer this mystery
It cancels out my misery
And gives me hope
That there could be
A person who loves me

[Verse 1]
You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be?
You're frozen when your heart's not open
You're so consumed with how much you get
You waste your time with hate and regret
You're broken when your heart's not open

[Chorus]
Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

[Verse 2]
Now there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same
If I lose you, my heart will be broken
Love is a bird, she needs to fly
Let all the hurt inside of you die
You're frozen when your heart's not open

[Chorus]
Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

[Verse 3]
You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be?
You're frozen when your heart's not open

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

[Outro]
If I could melt your heart

[Verse 1]
I'm in the sky where I oughta be at, I've been watching you
Rocket ship takin' off in that, now I'm onto you
Mouth closed, I don't want your opinion, who you talkin' to?
Stand out, no, I don't wanna blend in, why you want me to?

[Pre-Chorus]
They say be all I can be
And all I want is peace, peace, peace, peace, peace, peace
See the world, haven't seen it all
I wanna see it's, see it's, see it's, see it's, see it's dreams

[Chorus]
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Dream's real, it's alive
Come alive, come on

[Verse 2]
I can't react how you thought I'd rеact, I would never for you
Front line, I won't stand in thе back, 'cause you want me to
Mouth closed, I don't want your opinion, who you talkin' to?
Stand out, no, I don't wanna blend in, why you want me to?

[Pre-Chorus]
They say be all I can be
And all I want is peace, peace, peace, peace, peace, peace
See the world, haven't seen it all
I wanna see it's, see it's, see it's, see it's, see it's dreams

[Chorus]
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Dream's real, it's alive
Come alive, come on
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Dream's real, it's alive
Come alive, come on
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come on

[Interlude]
(Who you talking to?)
(Who you talking to?)

[Verse 3]
I'm in the sky where I oughta be at, I've been watching you
Rocket ship takin' off in that, now I'm onto you
Mouth closed, I don't want your opinion, who you talkin' to?
Stand out, no, I don't wanna blend in, why you want me to?

[Pre-Chorus]
They say be all I can be
And all I want is peace, peace, peace, peace, peace, peace
See the world, haven't seen it all
I wanna see it's, see it's, see it's, see it's, see it's dreams

[Chorus]
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Dream's real, it's alive
Come alive, come on
Come alive, come alive
Come alive, come alive
Dream's real, it's alive
Come alive, come on

[Outro]
Front line, I won't stand in the back
Front line, I won't stand in the back
Come alive, come alive

Obrigada
So, you know, I talk a lot about freedom in my show
And being a freedom fighter
But fight for freedom comes with a price, as we all know
It's a commitment, it's a lifestyle, do you have to ask yourself, "Do I have the balls to really be a freedom fighter?"
Do you? (I do)
Do you?  (I do)
You do?
You're very shy, you freedom fighters
You can't be a little freedom fighter, size-matters
As I said earlier, quoting the great James Balwdin
"Artists are here to disturb the peace"
So I hope that I have disturbed your peace
And I shall continue
Because after all, we are not here to be popular
We are here to be free

[Verse 2: Madonna]
Judge yourself, no one else
Day begins, wash away your sins
Raise your spirit, think I hear it
Boy you lay, put your head down
Feel the turning, feel the burning
Feel it burning, gotta love it, oh yeah
Let your light shine

[Chorus: Madonna & Quavo]
Not everyone is coming to the future (No)
Not everyone is learning from the past (Past)

[Intro]
I wrote this song, "I Rise", as a way of giving a voice to all marginalized people. People who don't have the opportunity to speak their mind. People who are in jail, incarcerated, bullied, beaten, abused, all people who feel that they are being oppressed. I hope that this song gives people hope and courage to be who they are, and to not be afraid to be who they are, and speak thеir mind, and to love themselvеs. Because you can't love other people unless you love yourself

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm goin' through it, yeah I know you see the tragic in it
Just hold on to the little bit of magic in it
I can't break down now
I can't take that now
Died a thousand times
Managed to survive
I can't break down now, I can't take that (I can't take that)

[Chorus]
I rise, I rise
I rise up above it, up above it
I rise, I rise
I rise up above it all

[Verse 1]
There's nothin' you can do to me that hasn't been done
Not bulletproof, shouldn't have to run from a gun (Gun)
River of tears ran dry, let 'em run
No game that you can play with me, I ain't won

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm goin' through it, yeah I know you see the tragic in it (Alright)
Just hold on to the little bit of magic in it (Yeah)
I can't break down now
I can't take that now (I can't take that now)
Died a thousand times
Managed to survive (I managed to survive)
I can't break down now
I can't take that (I can't take that)

[Chorus]
(I rise) I rise, I rise
(Rise) I rise up above it, up above it
(I rise) I rise, I rise
(Rise) I rise up above it all

[Verse 2]
I managed to survive (B.S.)
Freedom's what you choose to do with what's been done to you
No one can hurt you now unless you want them to
(Unless you want)
No one can hurt you now unless you love 'em to (B.S.)
Unless you love 'em to

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm going through it
Yeah, I know you see the tragic in it
Just hold on to the little bit of magic in it (Magic in it)
I can't break down now
I can't take that (I can't take that)

[Chorus]
I rise, I rise

Yeah, we gonna rise up (I will rise)
Yeah, we gonna rise up
Yeah, we gonna get up

We'll rise up, we can get it together
Yeah, we gonna rise up (I will rise)
Yeah, we gonna rise up
Yeah, we gonna get up
Yeah, we gonna get up
Yeah, we gonna get up
Yes, we can, we can get it together (I will rise)
We'll rise up, we can get it together
I will rise

I will rise
I will rise
Power to the people!
Thank you and goodnight!

[Spoken: James Baldwin]
"Love has never been a popular movement and no one’s ever wanted really to be free. The world is held together, really it is, held together, by the love and the passion of a very few people."

[Intro]
Yeah, can I, tell you what's on my mind

[Verse 1]
I know that you're on to me, baby
Tell me that you want me, baby
Really need your company, baby
If it's alright, you can roll with me, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Cruise around town, ride on autopilot
See it in your eyes, I can tell you liked it
Pull up in a Lamb', this is not a hybrid, my love
Give you everything, you get all of my love

[Chorus]
Is it okay if I take a night to be present, yeah?
I can give you everything tonight
I can give you everything
Is it okay if I take a night to be present, yeah?
I can give you everything tonight

[Verse 2]
I just wanna be with you, baby
Say the word, I'm comin' through, baby
Tell me what I gotta do, baby
Pulled up to your avenue, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Cruise around town, ride on autopilot (Pilot)
See it in your eyes, I can tell you liked it (Tell you liked it)
Pull up in a Lamb', this is not a hybrid, my love
Give you everything, you get all of my love

[Chorus]
Is it okay if I take a night to be present, yeah?
I can give you everything tonight
I can give you everything
Is it okay if I take a night to be present, yeah?
I can give you everything tonight

[Bridge]
I can give you my love
Everything is yours
All I have, you gotta say the word
Could be yours
Nothing in this world will change a thing
Nothing in this world will change a thing

[Chorus]
Is it okay if I take a night to be present, yeah?
I can give you everything tonight
I can give you everything
Is it okay if I take a night to be present, yeah?
I can give you everything tonight

[Outro]
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

[Tape Blip]
This is the first time we've ever-

[Track Restarts]
This is the first time we've ever played it in public, ever. Not necessarily a good thing

[Verse 1]
I won't run away no more
I promise
Even when I get bored
I promise
Even when you lock me out
I promise
I say my prayers every night
I promise
I know which side I'm spread
I promise
The tantrums and the chitty chats
I promise
Even when the ship is wreckеd
I promise
Tie me to thе rotting deck
I promise

[Verse 2]
I won't fool around no more
I promise
Even when I get bored
I promise
Even with your funny eyes
I promise
I won't be your goody boy
I promise

[Outro]
I won't run away no more
I promise

Is it alright?

[Verse]
Even when you lock me out
I promise
I say my prayers every night
I promise

[Outro]
I won't run away no more
I promise
Race down the street
Pair of new rollerblades on my feet
And I wasn't watching the time
Time wasn't catching up to me

The audacity!
The sun would go down on days like these
But I didn't see it like that
I just saw blue turnin' to pink

If I saw that kid now
I wish I could say I'd be looking down
But I've gotten smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller
I'm getting smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and

School was a mess
You were wearin' yourself out like a dress
How can I blame you for droppin' yourself
On my bedroom floor the night we met

And you said there's change all around
But why don't we stay the way we are now?
Cause I keep on losing all the parts of me
That I used to care the most about
So much to burn
So many shit lessons to be unlearned
And I'll just get better and better and better and better and better
I'm getting better and better and better and better and
I'm getting better and better and better and better
I'm getting better and better and better and
There not too many things that can excite me
As much as mail I've waited long to see
Just when I feel no one will ever write me
Well I'll be darn, here's a letter for me

Now I can almost hear them talking to me
The written word brings back more memories
And as I read those precious words of people that I left behind
The thoughts of things back home can always seem to cheer up my mind

Yes, I oughta send my congratulations
I'm gonna send a letter back homе

Back home, I'll spend my summer back homе
Back home, I'll spend my summer back home
Back home, I'll spend my summer back home
Back home, I'll spend my summer back home
Read your lips
"I'm too young for this"
On her couch, I'm lying on my back
She says it might be wrong, but can we
Try it out, she says my name out loud
And I realize that it's been a while since someone said it
Oh, the sun is coming

Street hockey
Can you roll with me?
To the time I missed the goal it went right
Through my mom’s window, it haunts my
Memory
Are you holding me?
Cause you know you’ll disappear in time
If you don't keep me here inside my head

[Verse 1]
These days, all my vacations happen when I'm asleep
Tonight's destination's my old elementary
Spring of 2012
Tarzan, 12-year-old boy swinging across the playground
Hair was down to my back, I never grew it back out
After sixth grade

[Pre-Chorus]
Well sorry, kid, I sold off the sunlight
Traded off the magic to make the rent
Come up kid, it's been such a long night

[Chorus]
Sunny boy, where'd you go and when you coming back out?
Sunny boy, where'd you go and when you coming back?
Sunny boy, where'd you go and when you coming back out?
Sunny boy, where'd you go?

[Verse 2]
These days stuck in my phone, I hardly feel like I'm free
Caged up in my body, hardly feeling like me
Dirt on my mind, my feet are so clеan

[Pre-Chorus]
Slow down, kid, there's no need to hurry
Someday soon I know wе'll figure it out
Calm down, kid, there's no need to worry

[Chorus]
Sunny boy, where'd you go and when you coming back out?
Sunny boy, where'd you go and when you coming back?
Sunny boy, where'd you go and when you coming back out?
Sunny boy, where'd you go?

[Post-Chorus]
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin' (Sunny Sunny boy, where'd you go? And when you're coming back out?)
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin' (Sunny Sunny boy, where'd you go? And when you're coming back out?)
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin' (Sunny Sunny boy, where'd you go? And when you're coming back out?)
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin' (Sunny Sunny boy, where'd you go?... out?)

[Outro]
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin'
Woke up this mornin'

[Verse 1]
She's holding her breath like she’s scared of it leaving
She's biting her tongue like I did last night
I said sorry but she just came closer and whispered
"It hurts pretty bad but it tastes kind of nice"
'Cause Love’s got an evil twin sister named Power
Who sticks by her side everywhere that she goes
You give somebody one, then you give them the other
So pleasе understand if I'd rather keep both
'Cause thеre's no part of me that can't be torn apart
If you're not ready to leave, then I'll take the head start

[Verse 2]
I've put too much trust in feelings for too much of my life
I convinced myself to love you before you had even tried
And now look where you are, curled up underneath your sheets
Teary-eyed, waiting for me
To pop up on your phone, it’s another night wasted
If you want control, well, then why don’t you take it?

When you don't get what you want, you start forgetting what you need
You do what you can to prove that you’re still relevant to me
I'm the fish that takes the bait just to be taken for a ride
If there's one thing that you've taught me, it’s that love is just a fight
Between a bug and a boot, so c'mon, choose your fighter
If you'll be the moth, I guess I'll be the lighter

[Chorus]
And times change like a compass
I'm turning away from this
There's more fish in the sea
Most of which have not hurt me
You passed by like a comet
You rolled through quick like Sonic
Now you want me to stay
A couple hundred miles too late

[Verse 3]
I didn't say yes, I didn't say no
When you asked if she's mine but I'm sure that you noticed
The change in my eyes, the change in my manner
The distaste for me that you wave like a banner
Seems to disappear when you start to play sober
To tell me you're sorry, you've thought it all over

[Chorus]
But times change like a compass
I'm turning away from this
There's more fish in the sea
Most of which have not hurt me
You passed by like a comet
You run through quick like Sonic
Now you want me to stay
A couple hundred miles too late
He's bleeding in bed
A boy lies melting reverently
Giving his whole self eventually to what'll drown him in the end

He's the waves that crash and break him down
He's the wind that tosses them around
He's the voices in his head

What's wrong?
Is it lonely out there all alone
As you float atop a blue unknown?
You better join it while you can

You can give up
No, you got so close
But a part of me can't help but hope
You follow through with what you said

Got a book of rules you'll never break
But thе sky's never felt morе opaque
Want you to show me how you bend (I got wants, I got needs)
I've got hands and a godspeed
I can change my biology
Put my faith in biology
(I've got all I could burn)
Now the pressure's more than he can stand
And at 3 am he takes his chance
Sneaks his phone down to his bed (I got wants, I got needs)
(I've got hands and a godspeed)
He convinced himself he heard a knock
(I can change my biology)
His door stays closed but doesn't lock
And what's outside scares him to death (Like a book, like a book)
In the dark, a boy becomes a man
In a world he’ll come to understand
Passes animals for men
Now she's telling me it's been a month
That she misses how we used to touch
I could hardly even tell

And there's something in the air tonight
But the tension's only on one side
I feel satisfied as hell

As my love's eaten away by lust
And my love's left there in the dust
Think I'm losing her as well

In the dark, a boy is playing man
I'm beginning now to understand
I'm no man, I'm something else
I could use a good dream tonight
Or even just some sleep
But I'm held by a conscious mind
And a fear of what darkness brings

The sun lights my past like summer
While the night hides the road ahead
And my eyes don't know which to choose
So they'll stay, turn back in my head

We hid in your car for days
Told you I wanted for nothing
Then my wants all turned to needs
And my needs all turned away

I play these keys for hours
With my dog sitting at my feet
She's not here 'cause she likes the sound
She just wants me to pick her up

Just give me a time and a placе
And surely I won't make it
But tell mе to stay away
And surely I'll be there
No such thing as a winnable fight
And if someone had told me earlier
Then maybe I wouldn't be here
Maybe I wouldn't be so tired

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
The long and winding road that leads to your door
Will never disappear, I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to your door

[Verse 2]
The wild and windy night that the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears, crying for the day
Why leave me standing here?
Let me know the way

[Bridge]
Many times I've been alone, and many times I've cried
Anyway, you'll never know the many ways I've tried

[Verse 3]
And still they lead me back to thе long and winding road
You left me standing herе a long, long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here
Lead me to your door

[Orchestral Solo]

[Verse 3]
But still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here (Don't keep me waiting)
Lead me to your door

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Awake, awake, my darling
The dawn has brought the day
Awake, awake, my darling
You mustn't sleep your life away

Awake, the birds are singing songs
They sing their song so clear
And hear the sounds that children sing
Their laughter fills the air

Awake, awake, oh fair one
This day was meant for you

Awake, the birds are singing songs
They sing their song so clear
And hear the sounds that children sing
Their laughter fills the air

Awake, awake, my darling
This day was meant for you
Perhaps today you'll find
Your dreams have all come truе
Awake, awake, my darling
This day was meant for you
All of my love bigger than the ocean
All of my heart I give to you
All that I am is moving in the river
Aa-aa, aa-aa-aah

Run, run, river, run
Move your body
Run, run, river, run
Move your body
Alright, this is Disney Girls

Clearing skies and drying eyes, now I see your smile
Sadness goes and your softness shows a changing style
Just in time words that rhyme will bless your soul
Now I'll fill your hands with kisses and a Tootsie Roll

Oh, reality, it's not for me
And it makes me laugh, oh
But fantasy world and Disney girls
Yes, I'm coming back

Patti Page and summer days on old Cape Cod
Happy times, making wine in my garage
Well, it's country shade and lemonade, guess I'm slowing down
It's a turned back world with a local girl in a smaller town

Oh, those open cars and clearer stars
That's what I've lacked, oh
But fantasy world and Disney girls
I'm coming back
(Love) Hi Rick and Dave, hi Pop, oh good morning, mom
(Love) Get up, guess what, I'm in love with a girl I found
She's really swell 'cause she likes church, bingo chances
And old-time dances

All my life I spent the nights with dreams of you
And the warmth I missed and for the things I wished, they're all coming true
I've got my love to give and a place to live, guess I'm going to stay
It'd be a peaceful life with my forever wife and kids someday

Oh, we have our early nights and those pillow fights
And your soft laugh, oh
But fantasy world and Disney girls
Yes, I'm coming back

A very pretty song, Bruce Johnston and Disney Girls
Thank you
There's a new album from The Beach Boys
It's called Surf's Up

Unfolding enveloping missiles of soul
Recall senses sadly...

The Beach Boys' last album Sunflower was critically acclaimed as the best in their ten year career
Now comes Surf's Up, which is even better

Hit hard at the battle that's confronting me, yeah
Knock down all the roadblocks a-stumbling me...

Surfs's Up. Newest from the group that long ago left water and sand for dry land where they could enrich American music with thеir melodies, harmonies and lyrics

Thеre's a riot goin' on...

The Beach Boys and Surf's Up
Their best yet on Brother/Reprise

Hit hard at the battle that's confronting me, yeah
Knock down all the roadblocks a-stumbling me, yeah
Throw off all the shackles...

[Intro: John Lennon]
I Dig a Pygmy by Charles Hawtrey and the Deaf Aids
Phase one, in which Doris gets her oats

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Two of us riding nowhere, spending someone's
Hard earned pay
You and me Sunday driving, not arriving
On our way back home

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Two of us sending postcards, writing letters
On my wall
You and me burning matches, lifting latches
On our way back home

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
You and I havе memories
Longer than thе road that stretches out ahead

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Two of us wearing raincoats, standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper, getting nowhere
On our way back home

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

[Verse 4: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Two of us wearing raincoats, standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper, getting nowhere
On our way back home

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[Outro]
We're going home
Better believe it
Goodbye

[Verse 1]
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

[Chorus]
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

[Verse 2]
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind insidе a letter box
They tumblе blindly as they make their way across the universe

[Chorus]
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

[Verse 3]
Sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my open ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on across the universe

[Chorus]
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

[Outro]
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva

All through the day
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine

Now they're frightened of leaving it
Everyone's weaving it
Coming on strong all the time
All through the day
I me mine

[Chorus]
I-I-me-me-mine
I-I-me-me-mine
I-I-me-me-mine
I-I-me-me-mine

No-one's frightened of playing it
Everyone's saying it
Flowing more freely than wine
All through the day
I me mine

[Chorus]
I-I-me-me-mine
I-I-me-me-mine
I-I-me-me-mine
I-I-me-me-mine

[Verse 2]
All I can hear

When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, "Let it be"
And in my hour of darkness, she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, "Let it be"

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

[Verse 2]
And when the brokenhearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may bе parted, there is still a chancе that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Yeah, there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

[Verse 3]
And when the night is cloudy, there is still a light that shines on me
Shine on 'til tomorrow, let it be
I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, "Let it be"

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Oh there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Oh there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

Oh, dirty Maggie Mae, they have taken her away

My baby said she's traveling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I’m traveling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
Said she's traveling on the one after 909

[Verse 2]
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees
You’re only fooling 'round, only fooling 'round with me
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as icе
Said she's traveling on the onе after 909

[Chorus]
Pick up my bag, run to the station
Railman said "You've got the wrong location"
Pick up my bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong

[Verse 1]
Well, she said she's traveling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I’m traveling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on, baby, don’t be cold as ice
She said she's traveling on the one after 909

[Chorus]
Pick up my bag, run to the station
Railman says you’ve got the wrong location
Pick up my bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong

Well, she said she's traveling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm traveling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice

Said she's traveling on the one after 9-0
Said she's traveling on the one after 9-0
Said she's traveling on the one after 909

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say she's got it coming
But she gets it while she can

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Oh, get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Loretta

Get back to where you once belonged

[Outro: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Get back
Ooh
Thanks, Moe
I'd like to say thank you on behalf of the group and ourselves, and I hope we passed the audition

[Verse 1]
I dig a pony
Well, you can celebrate anything you want
Yes, you can celebrate anything you want
Oh!
I do a road hog
Well, you can penetrate any place you go
Yes, you can penetrate any place you go
I told you so

[Chorus]
All I want is you
Everything has got to be just like you want it to
Because

[Verse 2]
I pick a moon dog
Well, you can radiate everything you are
Yes, you can radiate everything you are
Oh, now
I roll a stoney
Well, you can imitate everyone you know
Yes, you can imitate evеryone you know
I told you so

[Chorus]
All I want is you
Everything has got to be just likе you want it to
Because

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Ooh, now
I feel the wind blow
Well, you can indicate everything you see
Yes, you can indicate anything you see
Oh now
I load a lorry
Well, you can syndicate any boat you row
Yeah, you can syndicate any boat you row
I told you so

[Chorus]
All I want is you
Everything has got to be just like you want it to
Because

[Verse 1]
My little love
I see your eyes widen like an ocean
When you look at me so full of my emotions
I'm findin' it hard to be here sincerely
I know you feel lost, it's my fault completely

[Bridge: Adele & Angelo Adkins]
Tell me you love me
I love you a million percent

[Verse 2]
I don't recognise myself in the coldness of the daylight
So I ain't surprised you can read through all of my lies
I feel so bad to be here when I'm so guilty
I'm so far gone and you're the only one who can save mе

[Bridge: Angelo Adkins & Adele]
Oi, I feel like you don't love me
Why do you feel likе that?
Do you like me?
You know mummy doesn't like anyone else like I like you, right?

[Chorus]
I'm holdin' on (Barely)
Mama's got a lot to learn (It's heavy)
I'm holdin' on (Catch me)
Mama's got a lot to learn (Teach me)

[Bridge: Adele & Angelo Adkins]
Mummy's been having a lot of big feelings recently
Like how?
Just, like, hang on, my fingers are trapped
Like, um, I feel a bit confused
Why?
I don't know
And I feel like I don't really know what I'm doing
Oh, at all?
At all
And that would make me go...

[Verse 3]
My little love
Tell me, do you feel the way my past aches?
When you lay on me, can you hear the way my heart breaks?
I wanted you to have everything I never had
I'm so sorry if what I've done makes you feel sad

[Bridge: Adele & Angelo Adkins]
I love your dad 'cause he gave you to me
You're half me and you're half daddy
Oh

[Chorus]
I'm holdin' on (Barely)
Mama's got a lot to learn (It's heavy)
I'm holdin' on (Catch me)
Mama's got a lot to learn (Teach me)

[Outro]
I'm having a bad day, I'm having a very anxious day
I feel very paranoid, I feel very stressed
Um, I have a hangover, which never helps, but
I feel like today is the first day since I left him that I feel lonely
And I never feel lonely, I love being on my own
I always preferred being on my own than being with people
And I feel like maybe I've been, like, overcompensating
And being out and stuff like that to keep my mind off of him
And I feel like today, I'm home and I wanna be at home
I just wanna watch TV and curl up in a ball and
Be in my sweats and stuff like that, but I just feel really lonely
I feel a bit frightened that I might feel like this a lot

[Intro]
Hold on
You are still strong
Love will soon come
Just hold, hold on

[Verse 1]
Oh, what have I done yet again?
Have I not learned anything?
I don't want to live in chaos
It's like a ride that I want to get off
It's hard to hold on to who I am
When I'm stumblin' in the dark for a hand
I am so tired of battling with myself, with no chance to win

[Chorus]
(Hold on)
Let time be patient
(You are still strong)
Let pain be gracious
(Love will soon come)
Just hold, hold on

[Verse 2]
I swear to God, I am such a mess
The harder that I try, I regress
I'm my own worst enemy
Right now, I truly hate bein' me
Every day feels like the road I'm on
Might just open up and swallow me whole
How do I feel so mighty small
When I'm struggling to feel at all?

[Chorus]
Just hold on (Hold on)
Let time be patient
You are still strong (You are still strong)
Let pain be gracious (Love will soon come)
Just hold on (You, just hold on, you, just hold on)
Hold on (You, just hold on, just hold on)

[Bridge]
Sometimes loneliness is the only rest we get
(Just hold on, just hold on)
And the emptiness actually lets us forget
(Just hold on, just hold on)
Sometimes forgiveness is easiest in secret
(Just hold on, just hold on, just hold on, just hold on)

[Chorus]
So just hold on, ooh
Let time be patient and (You are still strong)
Let pain be gracious
Love will soon come, baby
If you just hold on

[Outro]
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on (Hold on)
Just let time be patient
'Cause you're still strong, you're still strong (You are still strong)
Just be gracious
Love will soon come
If you just hold on
(You, just hold on, you, just hold on, you, just hold on)
Just be patient, just be patient
(You, just hold on, you, just just hold on)
(You, just hold on, just hold on, just hold on)

[Verse 1]
I'm not from around here
But I come up here
To merry prank
Or stretch my bones in the fresh air
Phantom the opera
With candelabra
Deep in the night
I play my music enchanted

[Pre-Chorus]
With gambits and doodads
I'm boo Radley's comrade
No coffer can catch me
I linger on

[Chorus]
Now give me the throne
I'll be the luck of the draw
Flip all your coins
Now you're in my musical
But take your good caution
If you bring me to life
If I'm not impressed
Then I may give you a fright
Because I'm tricky
No, it don't come easy
But that just don't stop me
No no no, because I'm tricky

[Verse 2]
I've been grim reapin'
With tongue and cheek and
Solving the dungeon
With my book of Mudora
Full inventory
Trinkets and jewelry
Deal with the devil
With no worry or panic

[Pre-Chorus]
I menace emotion
With mystery potion
It's your favorite flavor
I linger on

[Chorus]
Now give me the throne
I'll be the luck of the draw
Flip all your coins
Now you're in my musical
But take your good caution
If you bring me to life
If I'm not impressed
Then I may give you a fright
Because I'm tricky
No, it don't come easy
But that just don't stop me
No no no, because I'm tricky
This song was written by Brian Wilson and his friend Van Dyke Parks, and Brian played it once on a TV show, a Leonard Bernstein special, and Leonard Bernstein said that it was one of the best songs ever to come out of rock music. So, cousin Carl here is gonna sing the song that Brian and Van Dyke wrote, called Surf's Up

A diamond necklace played the pawn
Hand in hand some drummed along, oh
To a handsome man and baton
(Bygone, bygone)
A blind class aristocracy
Back through the opera glass you see
The pit and the pendulum drawn
(Bygone, bygone)
Columnated ruins domino

Canvass the town and brush thе backdrop
Are you sleeping?

Hung velvet ovеrtaken me
Dim chandelier awaken me
To a song dissolved in the dawn
(Bygone, bygone)
The music hall a costly bow
The music all is lost for now
To a muted trumpeter swan
(Bygone, bygone)
Columnated ruins domino
Canvass the town and brush the backdrop
Are you sleeping, Brother John?

Dove nested towers the hour was strike the street quicksilver moon
Carriage across the fog Two-Step to lamp lights cellar tune
The laughs come hard in Auld Lang Syne
The glass was raised, the fired rose, the fullness of the wine, the dim last toasting
While at port adieu or die
A choke of grief heart hardened I
Beyond belief a broken man too tough to cry

Surf's Up, mhh-mhh-mhh, aboard a tidal wave
Come about hard and join the young and often spring you gave
I heard the word
Wonderful thing
A children's song

(Child, child, child, child, child)
(A child is the father of the man)
(Child, child, child, child, child)
(A child is the father of the man)
A children's song
(Child, child, child, child, child)
(A child is the father of the man)
Have you listened as they played
(Child, child, child, child, child)
(A child is the father of the man)
Their song is love
(Child, child, child, child, child)
(A child is the father of the man)
And the children know the way
(Child, child, child, child, child)
(A child is the father of the man)
(That’s why the child)
(Child, child, child, child, child)
(A child is the father of the man)
(Child, child, child, child, child)
(A child is the father of the man)
(Thats why the child)
(Child, child, child, child, child)
(A child is the father of the man)
Thank you
Carl Wilson

[Chorus]
Southern man, better keep your head
Don't forget what your good book said
Southern change gonna come at last
Now your crosses are burning fast
Southern man

[Verse 1]
I saw cotton and I saw black
Tall white mansions and little shacks
Southern man, when will you pay them back?
I heard screaming and bullwhips cracking
How long? How long? Ah

[Chorus]
Southern man, better keep your head
Don't forget what your good book said
Southern change gonna come at last
Now your crosses are burning fast
Southern man

[Verse 2]
Lily Belle, your hair is golden brown
I've seen your black man comin' 'round
Swear by God, I'm gonna cut him down
I heard screamin' and bullwhips crackin'
How long? How long? Ah

[Outro]
Southern man

[Intro]
(You can all sing along on this song if you want, 'cause it's really loud in here.)

[Chorus]
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
(If you're gonna do it folks, do it with me
You know, some musicians--I can't yell man
See what happens when we try to please you, we get feedback)

[False start #2]

[Chorus]
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain

[Chorus]
Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' therе too soon

[Verse 1]
It's so noisy at the fair
But all your friends are thеre
And the candy floss you had
And your mother and your dad

[Chorus]
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons--
Oh to live on
(Sing with me)
Oh to live on
(Don't clap, sing)
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin there too soon
You're leavin there too soon

[Verse 2]
Now you're underneath the stairs
And you're giving back some glares
To the people that you've met
And it's your first cigarette

[Chorus]
Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin there too soon
You're leavin there too soon

[Verse 3]
There's a girl just down the aisle
Oh, to turn and see her smile
You can hear the words she wrote
As you read a hidden note

[Chorus]
Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin there too soon
You're leavin there too soon

[Verse 4]
Now you say you're leaving home
And you want to be alone
Ain't it funny how you feel
When you're findin' out it's real?

[Chorus]
Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin there too soon
You're leavin there too soon

Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin there too soon
Lyrics from Snippet

...you won't
You always blame, it's never your fault
Sorry, not to get your feelings involved

Throwin' hunnids, hunnids, hunnids
Fuck it girl, you needed more
I wake up, I praise the lord...

[Verse 1]
A heart that's full up like a landfill
A job that slowly kills and
Bruises that won't heal
These things are sent to try us
Break up the election boxes
You don't, you don't look so good
Well I'll take a quiet life
A handshake, a heart attack with

A new career, inacheiving

[Chorus]
No alarms and no surprises

The unacceptable face of
The docile and the good
The spontaneous feeling
That there's something good
And I know that I want it
I know that I want it
I know that I want it but
It's there in your head
And if we stand up they'll
Mow us down again

[Verse 2]
I must have been around ghosts of
Everybody's here to

There's someone's gonna hide

I don't want it to come but
If we stand up they'll pull us down again

[Outro]
Huh
Sorry
From that bit?

[Verse]
And no one's ever told myself well
I know I should
Going: "I'll do the rounds"
I must mean that
And I don't wanna hide it
I don't wanna hide
I jump at the sight
You must be mad, 'cause
If we stand up they'll
Mow us down again

[Verse 1]
A boy gets a guitar and starts writing songs
About whiskey and women and getting too stoned
He got all three at the first show he played
Hometown says, "I don’t think Jesus done it that way"
Boy moves to city lives fast and goes hard
Starts chasing the devil through honky-tonk bars
Ignoring the voices in his head that say, "I don’t think Jesus done it this way"

[Chorus]
If I was him I’d say, "To hell with you, ain’t no helping you
Find someone else to give Heaven to I’m telling you
I’d shame me, I blame me
I’d make me pay for my mistakes"
Oh, but I don’t think Jesus does it that way

[Verse 2]
Boy's all alone got no one to turn to
He figures he’ll pray cause what else could he do
He said I wish you would’ve woke me up an easier way
But I don’t think Jesus does it that way

[Chorus]
If I was him I’d say, "To hell with you, ain’t no helping you
Find someone else to give Heaven to I’m telling you
I’d shame me, I blame me
I’d make me pay for my mistakes"
Oh, but I don’t think Jesus does it that way

[Outro]
The world likes to rear back and throw a few stones
So boy wants to throw a few stones of his own
Lord knows I ain’t perfect, and it ain’t my place
Oh, and I don’t think Jesus done it that way
Are y’all sure that Jesus done it that way?

You cop the clothes they give away, I'm in my house with (Bitch)
I'm with your housewife, trying on my outfits, taking off her blouses

[Verse 2: The Game]
I got a closet full of Gucci until further notice
Balenciaga fanny pack, hangin' over my shoulders
.45 on my waist, Louie Off-White leather
Ferrari's in every color like a Coogi sweater
I got a virgin from the Virgin Islands, want to meet Virgil
So we at New York Fashion Week in the A$AP circle
R.I.P. Yams but this Fendi sweatsuit gravy
Drop it off at Dapper Dan's, fuck it just go crazy
I got this Audemar, my niggas like it then we all the mall
We walk in AP, they pour champagne and bar the doors
Told Rocky, "don't spill on Sean John Velour"
Cartier frames while we listen to the Carter 4
In the store, out the store it's 

[?]
Chick from the Philippines in denim Amiri jeans
Lamborghini parked side ways, on 

[?]
Niggas in Paris with a pocket full of yay

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & DMX]
More money, more cash, more clothes (What)
Money, cash, clothes, money, cash, clothes (Cmon)
More money, more cash, more clothes (Cmon)

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
Now my insulation cost a Maybach
Yeah and your intuition costs like eight racks
Yeah and my intuition got me laid back
Fuck your intermission, bitch it's A$AP
Nigga word to Game fly face tat, where he got Ali at
Send a couple bloody guys to slide where you lay at
So hide where you stay at, reside where you pray at
You scared, go to church
This ain't a purse, it's a murse nigga

[Verse 4: The Game]
A$AP slid in one of my bitches DMs
He said if it wasn't me then it would be him
That's how this song happened, real shit, no cappin'
Chanel broach, flip the roach, ashes to ashes
Dust to dust, dust to dawn, dawn to wraith
Midtown Manhattan with the Cali plates
Dior high-tops, 

[?] face
Yellow diamonds, Richard Millie with the smiley face

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & DMX]
More money, more cash, more clothes (What)
Money, cash, clothes, money, cash, clothes (Cmon)

[Verse]
Roc Marciano told you it don't last, get you a snack
Photocopies of my shit hittin' the net, niggas is ass
I nicked my hand on a backboard glass, shattered it like shaq
Shakey as shaq down, don't get smacked out here tryna act wild
Runnin' with wolves like Karl Towns
Used to be on bullshit, bugged out
And the drink was duller than shark feelings
Six feet underneath the sun chillin, crispy
When everything turn tricky, miss me
I'm not gonna be your burn victim
I roll weed slow, I learn quickly
It's cyclical that's for certain
The sickness this type of motion bring
Windows open, I know this breeze
Lucifer son of the morning
I'm gon' let you talk yo self to sleep
These niggas scared of morals
I just went pro for the justice league
I love this team, I'm focused
Fuck police and the rona, only weed and yoga
Shorty save me the peace I was wantin'
Loose change rattling in my pocket
Threw it back to the block where I found it, uh
Two faces, the sea and the swamp
Talk out the side of your mouth like Harvey Dent
It's only gon' get niggas parked, bitch

[Chorus]
Lord, it's only big fish in the pond
Jump in, no risk, no reward
No joke, serious as stars
This the one I remember when I'm lost
In my thoughts thinkin too hard
Been gone a few winters too long
I couldn't miss this one

It's only big fish in the pond
Jump in, no risk, no reward
No joke, serious as stars
This the one I remember when I'm lost
In my thoughts thinkin too hard
Been gone a few winters too long
But, couldn't miss this one

[Chorus: Dylan Brady]
Seven-fifty-seven
Yeah, I'll never go to heaven
I've been smokin' since eleven
Told the devil he's a lemon, yeah
Seven-fifty-seven
Yeah, I'll never go to heaven
I've been smokin' since eleven
Told the devil he's a lemon, yeah

[Verse 1: Dylan Brady]
Seven-fifty-seven
Yeah, I'll never go to heaven
I've been smokin' since eleven
Told the devil he's a lemon
I got problems with my spending
All these voices in my head
I'm doing eighty in a stolen car
Never in a hurry
Singing: "La-di-da-di-da-di-da
All I wanna do is smoke some trees"
Drinkin' bottles of Moscato
Takin' pictures with the models
Stayin' up until the morning
Wish that I was more deserving
Goin' wild like I'm gonna lose the world
Wishin' some bottles were less harmful, yeah

[Chorus: Dylan Brady]
Seven-fifty-seven
Yeah, I'll never go to heaven
I've been smokin' since eleven
Told the devil he's a lemon, yeah
Seven-fifty-seven
Yeah, I'll never go to heaven
I've been smokin' since eleven
Told the devil he's a lemon, yeah

[Verse 2: Laura Les]
I exhale the blunt smoke, it sounds like a shotgun
I wanted a deal so I went out and I got one
Live in dog years and I feel 26
Yeah, I'm old bitch, but I learn new tricks
Like to throw hands like a ton of new bricks
Stay and smoke through trees that look like little sticks
Yeah, I smoke trees, little trees like dicks (hehehehe)

[Chorus: Dylan Brady]
Seven-fifty-seven
Yeah, I'll never go to heaven
I've been smokin' since eleven
Told the devil he's a lemon, yeah
Seven-fifty-seven
Yeah, I'll never go to heaven
I've been smokin' since eleven
Told the devil he's a lemon, yeah

[Outro: Laura Les & Dylan Brady]
Let's go
Send it back, send it back, send it back, do it
And I go, and I hit, and I go, and I hit
Do it all
And I say "do it all", and I say "do it all"
All the way, do it all, all the way
Throw it back
Bring it home, all the way
And I go, and I go, and I go
And I stop, and I stop, and I stop
All the way, all the way, all the way
And I go, and I go, and I go on fire

[Verse 1]
They said, "Doja hit so sticky," I said, "Dank you very much"
Bent the whole world over and said, "Spank you very much"
This shit no diarrhoea
Sick no gonorrhea
From the Westside like Maria
I'm hot like grits, Madea
Beat the pussy up, call PETA
I rock the boat like Aaliyah (Ayy)
I rock a bob like Sia (Ayy)
Doja on deck, bitch, re-up (Ayy)
Thick in the thigh, thick in the waist
Thick in the right motherfuckin’ places
Hits like Venus, Serena (Ayy)
He wanna eat up the caesar (Ayy)
Bonita, bonita, bonita (Ayy)
Baby girl needed the wiener (Ayy)
Dug in the guts and I skeet her (Ayy)
Arena, arena, arena (Hey)

Skinny legend like Wiz Khalifa (Woo)

[Chorus]
Hair grow long like Chia
Money go long like Nia

[Verse 2]
My cloons like Lowry
Now they all wanna shower me
Wanna see me spazz, talkin’ all that jazz, won't get that out of me
And you'd probably die to me, to be honest you'd probably battle me
If you want it then lick my ass, I'll make you beg to these, my mama proud of me, yeah
And I'm like “Hello?”
Damn fucking bitches on the low
That's some shit, you ain't even gotta know
Take off—
Moon's out tonight
Tonight I know
You will behold the night
Hmmm, it's still

Don't get me wrong, I want to love
I want to care, I want to help
Lie on my bed look at the wall
Maybe this longing will go away
It always does but when it comes
I don't know, I don't know what to do

[Verse 1: Chris]
When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
What could be worse?

[Chorus: Chris]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
I will try to fix you

[Verse 2: Billie & Finneas]
And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try, you'll never know
Just what you're worth

[Chorus: Chris, Billie & Finneas]
Lights will guidе you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Breakdown: Chris with Billie & Finneas]
Tеars stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Oh, and tears stream down your face, and I
Oh, tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Oh, and the tears stream down your face, and I

[Chorus: All & Billie]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
The place I cured, is it costing my love
So I keep calling even though you're gone
You made every little single seem easier
That's why it's so damn hard to move on
Yeah I can't take back the words I said
And I can't change all the things I did
You made every little single seem easier
But now it's so hard to get that you're gone, you're gone
And I can't move on

I fucked up you right, but you left now I'm wrong
Yeah I text I call, But I get no response
Just the same voicemail that plays on and on
You're gone, you're gone, and I can't move on
I fucked up you right, but you left now I'm wrong
I text I call, But I get no response
Just the same voicemail that plays on and on

A devastating backstroke
All the way from France
With shiny, shiny cufflinks
A shirtsleeve to enhance

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The pin-striped men of morning
Are coming forward to dance
With pure Egyptian Cotton
The kids don't stand a chance

[Chorus]
The kids don't stand
The kids don't stand
The kids don't stand a chance
The kids don't stand
The kids don't stand
The kids don't stand a chance

[Verse 2]
You criticize the practice

Ignoring all the history
Denying them romance

[Pre-Chorus 2]
The pin-striped men of morning
Are coming forward to dance
Forty-million dollars
The kids don't stand a chance

[Chorus]
The kids don't stand

The kids don't stand a chancе

Didn't like the business
But that was at first glance
Your pillow feels so soft now
But still you must advance

[Pre-Chorus 3]
The pin-striped men of morning
The partners in the dance
The paper's shot to pieces
The kids don't stand a chance

[Chorus]

The kids don't stand
The kids don't stand a chance
The kids don't stand
The kids don't stand

Walcott, don't you know that it's insane?
Don't you want to get out of Cape Cod
Out of Cape Cod tonight?
Walcott, Mystic Seaport is that way
Don't you know that your life could be lost
Out of Cape Cod tonight?

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]

Walcott, all the way to New Jersey
All the way to the Garden State
Out of Cape Cod tonight

Evil feasts on human lives
The Holy Roman Empire roots for you

Who gives a fuck about an Oxford comma?
I've seen those English dramas too; I did
So if there's any other way to spell the 

[?]
It's fine with me, with me

[Chorus 1]
Why would you speak to me that way?
Especially when I always said that I
Haven't got the words for you
All your diction dripping with disdain
Through the pain, I always tell the truth

[Verse 2]
Who gives a fuck about an Oxford comma?
I climbed to Dharamsala too, I did
I met the highest Lama
His accent sounded fine to me, to me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Take your passport, it's no trick
Take the chapstick, put it on your lips
Crack a smile, adjust my tie
Know your boyfriend, unlike other guys

[Chorus 2]
Why would you lie 'bout how much coal you have?
Why would you lie about something dumb likе that?
Why would you lie 'bout anything at all?
First the window, then it's to thе wall
Lil Jon, he always tells the truth

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Check your passport, it's no trick
Take the chapstick, put it on your lips
Crack a smile, adjust my tie
Know your butler, unlike other guys

[Chorus 3]
Why would you lie 'bout how much coal you have?
Why would you lie about something dumb like that?
Why would you lie 'bout anything at all?
First the window, then it's to the wall
Why would you tape my conversations?
Show your paintings at the United Nations
Lil Jon, I always tells the truth

[Intro]
("The mack")

[Chorus]
Just call me a mack ("The mack")
'Cause I got it like that ("The mack")

And if you really wanna know what my name is
(Just call me a mack) Word, right
Just call me the mack ("The mack")
Any time, baby ("The mack")
'Cause I ain't confused ("Who's the mack?")

[Verse 1]
I may be kind of young
But I got a whole lot of man in me
So I'm afraid
That I can't be played, ha ha
I don't mind
If you wanna come by my crib and chill
But just be surе that you call me first

[Pre-Chorus]
Because thе last girl that tried
To just be droppin' on by (Oh, no)
Learned not to play a player
And girl, you know I ain't havin' it

So let me kick it to ya
I don't have a lot of girls
But I gotta know I'll get the respect that I give
That's just the way I live

[Pre-Chorus]
Because the last girl I had
Was moving things too fast (Slow down)
She tried to fool a fooler
And girl, you know I ain't havin' that

(Rules)
Just call me a mack ("Who's the mack?")

[Verse 3]
The mack is right here
And yes, I give as much
As giving a little love, it's spreading everywhere
("Who's the mack?")
You see it's here (Here), here (Here), and here
Can't you feel it?
If I'm having a little trouble
I know my girl will always heal it
Peel it like an orange 'cause the looks ain't nothin', miss
The lovin' and huggin' and bitterness out there keeps me pumpin'
Humpin' on stage, I'm engaged and yes, the truth is
If you're seein' an ugly woman you bet I'm G'in'

[Pre-Chorus]
Just like Usher's my name
I can't go changing my ways (Oh, no)
As long as I'm chillin'
Then baby, you can call me the mack

[Chorus]
Just call me a mack
'Cause I got it like that
You gotta play by the rules
Or I'll get back with you
It's a well-known fact
(It's a well-known fact, whoa, whoa, yeah)
That I got it like that
You gotta play by the rules
Just call me a mack ("Who's the mack?")
Just call me a mack
'Cause I got it like that
You gotta play by the rules
Or I'll get back with you
It's a well-known fact

(Lovin' you, baby)
Seems like I've been here before (Me and you, lady)
(I can't get you out of my mind)

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
To another love, one that I can trust
With my heart I know she'll never run away
Just can't take no more
So I'm out the door
Talk to me
Why you wanna play love games?
("Yes, yes, y'all, to the beat, all")
("Excuse me, dear, my God, you look nice")

[Verse 1]
I got your Christmas card
And you know it warms my heart
Just to think of all the cheer
We could share if you were here
I'll make my Christmas list
And give it to my boy St. Nick
And I hope he hooks, hooks me up
'Cause I planned a special Christmas for us

[Chorus]
I was hoping that you might be coming for Christmas (Yeah)
I was hoping that surely by New Year's Eave (New Year's Eve)
I was hoping that you might be coming for Christmas
And I hope that you're bringing something for me (Something for me, baby)

[Verse 2]
Now, we'll chill Christmas Eve
I can't wait for my moms to leave
Snuggle, I'll turn down the lights
And give our gifts if the timing is right, oh

[Chorus]
I was hoping that you might be coming for Christmas (Christmas, baby)
I was hoping that surely by (Surеly by) New Year's Eve
I was hoping that you might bе coming for Christmas
And I hope that you're bringing something for me (Something for me, baby)

[Bridge]
For now I'll wait, yes, I will
And I hope that Santa won't be late
'Cause I don't want no presents
See, I'm too old for toys
I just want my baby
She's my one and only
Truly one and only, she's my only

[Chorus]
I was hoping that you might be coming for Christmas (Ho, ho, ho, ho)
I was hoping that surely by New Year's Eve (Ah, ah, yeah)
I was hoping that you might be (Coming with me) coming for Christmas
(For Christmas, yeah, yeah)
And I hope that you're bringing something for me (Something for me, yeah)
I was hoping that you might be coming for Christmas (Yeah, yeah)
I was hoping that surely by (Surely) New Year's Eve (By, yeah)
I was hoping that you might be coming for Christmas
And I hope that you're bringing something for me (Something for me, yeah, yeah)
I was hoping that you might be coming for Christmas

Hello everybody, welcome today to the wonderful world of U
Now check it, you have two options: you can eat it or throw it away
See, it's a shame that when you're working hard and doing well
People hate you, yeah
Buying nothing else but the best for yourself
They really hate you, yeah
You gotta live for you and no one else
Don't let 'em make you feel like you're not being real
Just live how you wanna live, you gotta do for you

[Pre-Chorus]
(Dig that)
If you work hard play hard
(Dig that)
And do what you wanna do
(Dig that)
Just pop ya collar don't, let what people say bother you
(Dig that)
You perpetrators I got something to say
(Whats that?)
You can eat it or throw it away
(Picture that)
You're just mad 'cause you're following in my tracks
Now can you dig that? Hey

Hey ladies (Yeah)

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
You can see me every week hanging out
With a different girl sitting next to me
'Cause I'm not about to settle down right now
I gotta be free
Some of y'all fellas might be jealous
But y'all know that don't faze me
I just pop my collar, tip my hat
And turn my back on the ones that hated me

[Pre-Chorus]
(Dig that)
Never going home alone
(Dig that)
If she follows then you know it's on
(Dig that)
She gets the pager not the cellular phone
(Never that)
I let her know I won't be around for long
(Dig that)
To all you haters I got something to say
(Whats that?)
You can eat it or throw it away
(Picture that)
Stop hatin', wishin', waitin'
Anticipating for my heat to fade

[Chorus]
Hey ladies (Yeah)
And all my fellas (Yeah)
You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous (Pop-pop)
They only hate you 'cause you're a go-getter (Pop-pop)
Pop ya collar, don't let 'em sweat ya (Pop)
My ladies (Yeah)
My fellas (Yeah)
You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous (Pop-pop)
They only hate you 'cause you're a go-getter (Pop-pop)
Pop ya collar, don't let 'em sweat ya

[Bridge]
(Pop, pop, pop, pop)
I break my neck for the things I get
So much sweat just so I can get that check
And I'm not gonna let nobody bring me down
(Nobody's gonna steal my crown)
Because I eat good (Eat good), I live good (Live good)
I rock good (Rock good), my life good (Life good)
Eat good (Eat good), I live good (Live good)
I rock good (Rock good), my life good (Life good)
Eat good (Eat good), I live good (Live good)
I rock good (Rock good), my life good (Life good)
If you got a lot and you're working for it
Pop ya collar, don't be afraid to show it

[Chorus]
Hey ladies (Yeah)
Hey fellas (Yeah)
You know you're doing good 'cause they're jealous (Pop-pop)
They only hate you 'cause you're a go-getter (Pop-pop)
Pop ya collar, don't let 'em sweat ya (Pop)

[Intro]
I don't understand, why
See, it's burning me to hold onto this
I know this is something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm trying to say is that I love you
I just—I feel like this is coming to an end
And it's better for me to let it go now than hold on and hurt you
I gotta let it burn

[Verse 1]
It's gonna burn for me to say this
But it's coming from my heart
It's been a long time coming
But we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out
But I don't think you're gonna change
I do, but you don't
Think it's best we go our separate ways

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting, baby? I ain't happy, baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same
And your body don't want to
But you know
Gotta let it go
'Cause the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Evеn though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta lеt it burn
Deep down you know it's best for yourself
But you hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

[Verse 2]
Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here but I want you
'Cause the feeling ain't the same
Find myself callin' her your name
Ladies tell me do you understand?
Now all my fellas do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I know I made a mistake
Now it's too late
I know she ain't coming back
What I gotta do now
To get my shorty back, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Man, I don't know what I'm gonna do without my boo
You've been gone for too long
It's been fifty-eleven days, umpteen hours
I'ma be burnin' 'til you return

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same
And your body don't want to
But you know
Gotta let it go
'Cause the party ain't jumpin' like it used to

Oh, I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side I wanna break down and cry
Oh, I, I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side I wanna break down and cry
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah, ooh-ooh-ooh

I just—I feel like this is coming to an end
And it's better for me to let it go now than hold on and hurt you
I gotta let it burn

[Verse 1]
It's gonna burn for me to say this
But it's coming from my heart
It's been a long time coming
But we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out
But I don't think you're gonna change
I do, but you don't
Think it's best we go our separate ways

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting, baby? I ain't happy, baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same
And your body don't want to
But you know
Gotta let it go
'Cause the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Lеt it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn
Deep down you know it's best for yoursеlf
But you hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
And know it is through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

[Verse 2]
Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here but I want you
'Cause the feeling ain't the same
Find myself callin' her your name
Ladies tell me do you understand?
Now all my fellas do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I know I made a mistake
Now it's too late
I know she ain't coming back
What I gotta do now
To get my shorty back, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Man, I don't know what I'm gonna do without my boo
You've been gone for too long
It's been fifty-eleven days, umpteen hours
I'ma be burnin' 'til you return

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same
And your body don't want to
But you know
Gotta let it go
'Cause the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn (Let it burn, let it burn, you gon' learn)
Let it burn (Gotta let it burn)
Gotta let it burn (Oh)
Deep down you know it's best for yourself
But you hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
And know it is through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

[Bridge]
Oh, I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side I wanna break down and cry
Oh, I, I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side I wanna break down and cry
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah, ooh-ooh-ooh
Can you feel me burning, baby?
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
It's been umpteen days, umpteen hours
I'ma be burnin' 'til you return

[Chorus]
(Let it burn)
When your feeling ain't the same
And your body don't want to
But you know
Gotta let it go
'Cause the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn
Deep down you know it's best for yourself
But you hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
And know it is through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

[Verse 1]
They say life is a battlefield
I say bring it on
If you wanna know how I feel
Live it 'til it's gone
I'm just saying that what don't kill, only makes you strong
If you don't recognize what is real
Then forever is a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long time

[Pre-Chorus]
Some things never change, here we go again
Feel like I'm losing my mind
Shake it off, let it go, I don't care anymore

[Chorus]
Just go numb
You never know until you let go
Let's go numb
I can feel you now
I can feel you now

[Verse 2]
Keep on doing the same old thing
And you expecting change
Well, is that really insanity
Or just a loser's game?
I only trust in the things I feel
Some may say that's strange
You better recognize what is real
'Cause forever is a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long time

[Verse 1]
I see you over there, so hypnotic
Thinking 'bout what I'd do to that body
I get you like, ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby
Got no drink in my hand, but I'm wasted
Getting drunk off the thought of you naked
I get you like, ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
And I try to fight it, to fight it
But you're so magnetic, magnetic
Got one life, just live it, just live it
Now relax and get on your back

[Chorus]
If you wanna scream "yeah"
Let me know and I'll take you there
Get you going like, ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby

If you want it done right

Get you going like, ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby
If you wanna scream

[Verse 2]
Kill the lights, shut them off, you're electric
Devil еyes telling me comе and get it
I'll have you like, ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby
Girl, tonight, you're the prey, I'm the hunter
Take you here, take you there, take you under
Imagine me, whispering in your ear that I wanna
Take off all your clothes and put something on ya

[Pre-Chorus]
And I try to fight it, to fight it
But you're so magnetic, magnetic
Got one life, just live it, just live it
Now relax and get on your back

[Chorus]
If you wanna scream, "yeah"
Let me know and I'll take you there
Get you going like, ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby
If you want it done right
Hope you're ready to go all night
Get you going like, ooh baby, baby, ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, baby, ooh baby
If you wanna scream

[Verse 1: Usher]
I can't win, I can't reign
I will never win this game
Without you, without you
I am lost, I am vain
I will never be the same
Without you, without you

I won't run, I won't fly
I will never make it by
Without you, without you
I can't rest, I can't fight
All I need is you and I
Without you, without you

[Chorus: Usher]
Oh-oh-oh
You, you, you
Without
You, you, you
Without you

[Verse 2: Usher]
Can't erase, so I'll take blame
But I can't accept that we're estranged
Without you, without you
I can't quit now, this can't be right
I can't take one more sleepless night
Without you, without you
I won't soar, I won't climb
If you're not here, I'm paralyzed
Without you, without you
I can't look, I'm so blind
I lost my heart, I lost my mind
Without you, without you

[Chorus: Usher]
Oh-oh-oh
You, you, you
Without
You, you, you
Without you

[Outro: Usher]
I am lost, I am vain
I will never be the same
Without you, without you
Without you

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Right outside this lazy summer home
Ain't got time to call your soul a critic, no
Right outside the lazy gate of winter's summer home
Wondering where the nut-thatch winters
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
There comes a rеdeemer, and he slowly too fades away
And follows a wagon bеside him that's loaded with clay
The seeds that were silent all burst into bloom, and decay
And night comes so quiet, it's close on the heels of the day

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Sometimes we live no particular way but our own
Sometimes we visit your country and live in your home
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own

[Outro]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning, felt around for my shoes
That's when I knew I had them old, the walkin' blues
I woke up this morning, looked around, and I felt around for my shoes
That's when I knew I had them old, mean old walkin' blues

[Veres 2]
Well, feel most like blowin' my old lonesome horn
Woke up this morning and what I was gone
I wanna leave, leave my old lonesome home
Woke up this morning, what I had was gone
What I had was gone

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Well, some people tell you these old walkin' blues ain't bad
Worst old feelin' that I've еver had
Some peoplе tell you these old walkin' blues ain't so bad
Worst old feelin' I've most ever had
I've ever had

[Verse 4]
Leaving in the morning if I have to ride the blind
Well, I've been mistreated and I don't mind dyin'
I'm gon' leave, even if I have to ride the blind
Well, I've been mistreated and I don't mind dyin', don't mind
Really don't mind

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
She got an Elgin movement from her head down, oh, to her toes
Breaking on a dollar 'most anywhere she goes
She got a move, movement right down to her toes
Breaking on a dollar 'most anywhere she goes, anywhere she goes

[Verse 6]
I woke up this morning, felt around for my shoes
That's when I knew I had them old walkin' blues
I woke up this morning, looked around and I felt around for my shoes
That's when I knew I had them old, mean old walkin' blues

[Outro]
Old walkin' blues, old walkin' blues
Old walkin' blues, old walkin' blues
Walkin' blues, walkin' blues
Old walkin' blues, old walkin' blues
Old walkin' blues, walkin' blues

[Verse 1]
Gone are the days when the ox fall down
Take up the yoke and plow the fields around
Gone are the days when the ladies said "Please
Gently, Jack Jones, won't you come to me"

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
Looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 2]
1920 when he stepped to the bar
Drank to the dregs of the whiskey jar
1930 when the wall caved in
He made his way selling red-eyed gin

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
It looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Delilah Jones was the mother of twins
Two times over and you know the rest were sins
Raised eight boys, only I turned bad
Didn't get the lickin's that the other ones had

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
Looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Bridge]
Tumble down shack in Big Foot county
Snowed so hard that the roof caved in
Delilah Jones went to meet her God
And the old man never was the same again

[Verse 4]
Daddy made whiskey and he made it well
Cost two dollars, you know it burned like hell
I cut hickory just to fire the still
Drink down a bottle and be ready to kill

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
It looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 5]
Gone are the days when the ox fall down
Take up the yoke and plow the fields around
Gone are the days when the ladies said "Please
Gently, Jack Jones, won't you come to me?"

[Chorus]
Brown-eyed women and red grenadine
The bottle was dusty, but the liquor was clean
Sound of the thunder with the rain pourin' down
It looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Outro]
And it looks like the old man's gettin' on

[Verse 1]
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble
Ancient footprints are everywhere
Well, you could almost think that you're seein' double
On a cold dark night on the Spanish Stairs

[Chorus 1]
Gotta hurry on back to my hotel room
Where I've got me a date with Botticelli's niece
She promised she'd be right there with me
When I paint my masterpiece

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Oh, the hours I've spent inside the Colosseum
Dodging lions, yes, and wastin' timе
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle
I could hardly stand to see 'еm
Where it sure has been a long hard climb

[Chorus 2]
Train wheels rollin' through the back of my memory
When I ran on the hilltop following a pack of wild geese
And someday, life will be sweet like a rhapsody
When I paint my masterpiece

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
So I left Rome, and I landed in Brussels
On a flight so darn bumpy that I almost cried
Clergymen in uniform, young girls pullin' muscles
Well, it sure has been a long hard ride

[Chorus 3]
Newspapermen eating candy
Had to be held down by big police
And someday, everything gonna be different
When I paint my masterpiece

[Outro]
Someday, everything's gonna be different, yes, it will
When I paint my masterpiece
When I paint (When I paint) my masterpiece

[Verse 1]
Loose Lucy is my delight
She come running and we ball all night

[Chorus 1]
Round and round and round and round
(Round and round, round and round)
And it don't take much to get me on the ground
I'm a yo-yo, here's my string
Listen to the birds on the hot wire sing
Yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah) Yeah
Singing "Thank you, for a real good time"

[Verse 2]
I got jumped coming home last night
Shadow in the alley turned off all my lights

[Chorus 2]
Round and round and round and round
(Round and round, round and round)
Well, it don't take much to get me on the ground
Loose Lucy, she was sore
And I know you don't want my love no more
Singing, yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah), yeah
Singing "Thank you, for a real good time"

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Be-bop baby, how can this be?
I know you've been out and cheating on me

[Chorus 3]
Round and round and round and round
Well, it don't take much to get the word around
Cross my heart and hope to die
I was just hanging out with those other guys
Singing, yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah), yeah
Singing "Thank you, for a real good time"

[Verse 4]
I went back home with two black eyes
You know I'll love you 'til the day I die

[Chorus 3]
Round and round and round and round
Well, it don't take much to get the word around
I'm not yours but I like your type
Don't shake the tree where the fruit ain't ripe
Singing yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah), yeah

[Outro]
Singing yeah (Yeah), yeah (Yeah), yeah (Yeah), yeah
Singing yeah (Yeah), oh yeah (Yeah), yeah-yeah-yeah (Yeah), yeah, yeah
Singing "Thank you, for a real good time"

[Verse 1]
I have seen where the wolf has slept by the silver stream
I can tell by the mark he left you were in his dream
Ah, child of countless trees
Ah, child of boundless seas
What you are and what you're meant to be
Speaks his name, though you were born to me
Born to me, Cassidy

[Verse 2]
Lost now on the country miles in his Cadillac
I can tell by the way you smile he's rolling back
Come and wash the nighttime clean
Come and grow this scorched ground green
Blow the horn, tap the tambourinе
Close the gap of the dark yеars in between
You and me, Cassidy

[Bridge]
Quick beats in an icy heart
Catch-colt draws a coffin cart
There he goes and now here she starts
Hear her cry
Flight of the seabirds, scattered like lost words
Wheel to the storm and fly

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Faring thee well now
Let your life proceed by its own design
Nothing to tell now
Let the words be yours, I'm done with mine
Faring thee well now
Let your life proceed by its own design
Nothing to tell now
Let the words be yours, I'm done with mine

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Flight of the seabirds, scattered like lost words
Wheel to the storm and fly

[Verse 1]
Great North Central, would you all board
You can't find a ride like that no more
The night the chariot swung down slow
Ninety-nine children had a chance to go
One long party from the start to end
Tune to the whistle going down the bend
No great hurry, what do you say?
Might as well channel me every good way

[Chorus]
Might as well, might as well (Might as well, might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well, might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)

[Verse 2]
Ragtime slowly for twenty-five miles
Then switch over to the Cajun style
Bar car blowing rhythm and blues
Rock band wailing in the old caboose
Long train running from coast to coast
Bringing home a party when they need it the most
I said, "Hey, what do you say
Nothing else shaking so you might just as well"

[Chorus]
Might as well, might as well (Might as well, might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well, might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)

[Bridge]
Never had such a good time in my life before
I'd like to have it one time more
One good ride from start to end
I'd like to take that ride again
Again

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Ran out of track and I caught the plane
Back in the county with the blues again
Great North Central being on my mind
I might like to ride it just one more time

[Chorus]
Might as well, might as well (Might as well, might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well, might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)

[Outro]
You might as well, might as well (Might as well, might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well, might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)
Hey, might as well, might as well (Might as well)
You might as well, might as well (Might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)
You might as well, might as well (Might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)
Might as well, might as well (Might as well)

We'll be back in just a little bit

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
This must be heaven
Tonight I cross the line
You must be the angel
I thought I might never find
Was it you I heard singing
While I was chasing dreams?
Driven by the wind
Like the dust that blows around

[Chorus]
The rain fallin' down now
Way I never know now
Still never know, no, no

[Verse 2]
Got to be heaven
'Cause here's where the rainbow ends
If this ain't the real thing
Well, it's close enough to pretend
But when that wind blows
When the night's about to fall
I can hеar the sirens call
It's a certain sort of sound

[Chorus]
Whеn the rain fallin' down now
Rain fallin' down
The rain fallin' down now

[Bridge]
Holes in what's left of my reason
Holes in the knees of my blues
Odds against me been increasin'
But I'll pull through

Never could read no road map
No, I don't know what the weather might do
But hear that witch wind whinin'
See that dog star shinin'
I've got a feelin' there's no time to lose
No time to lose

Well, I never know, no
Just don't ever know, no, no

[Verse 3]
Well, it's been heaven
Even rainbows will end
Now my sails are fillin'
And the wind is willin'
That I'm good as gone again
I'm still walkin', so I'm sure that I can dance
Just a Saint of Circumstance
Just a tiger in a trance
With the rain fallin' down

[Chorus]
Rain fallin' down
The rain fallin' down
Rain fallin' down now
The rain fallin', rain fallin', rain fallin' down
The rain fallin' down

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Woo, well, never know now
Just don't ever know, no, no, no, no
Never never know
I sure don't know what I'm going for
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
I sure don't know what I'm going for
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
I sure don't know what I'm going for
(Just don't know now, yeah, yeah)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
(I'm gonna go for it for sure, yes, for sure)
I sure don't know what I'm going for
(Just don't know, hard to say)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
(You know something gotta happen any way now)
I sure don't know what I'm going for
(...seem far and wide now, wide now)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
(Still can't see...)
I sure don't know what I'm going for
(Still can't see that other mountain on the side now, still can't see that other mountain on the side)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
(Gonna go, for sure now)
I sure don't know what I'm going for
(Hey, maybe going on a dream now)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
(Hey, maybe going on a feeling, hey)
I sure don't know what I'm going for
(Maybe going on a dream now)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
(Maybe going on a feeling, maybe going on a feeling)

[Verse 1]
Went to see the captain, strangest I could find
Laid my proposition down, laid it on the line
I won't slave for beggar's pay, likewise gold and jewels
But I would slave to learn the way to sink your ship of fools

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Verse 2]
The bottles stand as empty
As they were filled before
Time there was and plenty
But from that cup no more
I won't leave you drifting down, but whoa, it makes me wild
With thirty years upon my head
To have you call me child

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Verse 3]
The bottles stand as empty
As they were filled before
Time there was and plenty
But from that cup no more
Though I could not caution all
You know, I still might warn a few
Don't lend your hand to raise no flag atop no ship of fools

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Outro]
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Chorus 1]
Truckin', got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

[Verse 1]
Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

[Chorus 2]
Dallas, got a soft machine
Houston, too close to New Orleans
New York got the ways and means
But just won't let you be, oh no

[Verse 2]
Most of the cats you meet on the street speak of true love
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they better get goin'
Out of thе door and down on the street all alone

[Chorus 3]
Truckin', like thе do-dah man
Once told me "You've got to play your hand"
And sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay 'em down

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Verse 3]
What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, and vitamin C, and cocaine
All her friend can say is "It's a fuckin' shame"

[Chorus 4]
Truckin', up to Buffalo
I've been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
It takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

[Verse 4]
You're sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
Well, I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

[Chorus 5]
Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowling pin
Knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be, oh no

[Verse 5]
You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
Well, I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Outro]
Truckin', I'ma goin' home
Whoa whoa, baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Get back truckin' on
Get back truckin' on
Get back truckin' on
Get back truckin' on
Get back truckin' on
Get back truckin' on

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Please don't dominate the rap, Jack
If you've got nothing new to say
If you please, don't back up the track
This train has got to run today
I spent a little time on the mountain
I spent a little time on the hill
Heard some say: Better run away
Others say: You better stand still
I don't know but I've been told
In the heat of the sun, a man died of cold
Keep on runnin', don't stand and wait
With the sun so dark and the hour so late

[Refrain]
One way or another
One way or another
One way or another
This darkness got to give

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Who can deny? Who can deny?
It's not just a changе in style
One step donе and another begun
And I wonder how many miles?
I spent a little time on the mountain
Spent a little time on the hill
I saw things getting out of hand
I guess they always will
I don't know but I've been told
It's a hill to run with a plate of gold
Other hand I've heard it said
It's just as hard with the weight of lead

[Refrain]
One way or another
One way or another
One way or another
This darkness got to give

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
You can't overlook the lack, Jack
Of any other highway to ride
It's got no signs or dividing lines
And very few rules to guide
I spent a little time on the mountain
Spent a little time on the hill
I saw things you don't understand
But I think in time I guess we will
I don't know but I've been told
If the horse don't pull you got to carry the load
I don't know whose back's that strong
Maybe find out before too long

[Outro]
One way or another
One way or another
One way or another
This darkness got to give
One way or another
One way or another
One way or another
This darkness got to give
One way or another
One way or another
One way or another
You know this darkness got to give
This darkness got to give
This darkness got to give
This darkness got to give
This darkness got to give
This darkness got to give
This darkness got to give

[Verse 1: Jerry Garcia]
I rode in to Nazareth, I was feeling about half past dead
I just need a place where I could lay my head
Said, "Mister, can you tell me where a man might find a bed?"
He just grinned and shook my hand and "No" is all he said

[Chorus: Grateful Dead]
Take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And (And, and) you put the load (Put your load right on me)

[Verse 2: Bruce Hornsby]
I packed up my bags, I went looking for place to hide
When I saw Carmen and the Devil walking side-by-side
I said, "Hey Carmen, come on, won't you go downtown."
She said, "Well, I gotta go but my friend can stick around."

[Chorus: Grateful Dead]
Take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And (And, and) you put the load (Put your load right on me)

[Verse 3: Phil Lesh]
Go down Miss Mosеs, there is nothing that you can say
It's just Old Luke, and Lukе's waiting on the Judgement Day
Well, Luke, my friend, what about Miss Anna Lee?
"Do me a favor, son, won't you stay and keep Anna Lee company."

[Chorus: Grateful Dead]
Take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And (And, and) you put the load (Put your load right on me)

[Verse 4: Bob Weir]
Crazy Chester followed me and he caught me in the fog
He says, "I'll fix you right, if you'll kiss Jack, my dog."
I said, "Hey, wait a minute, Chester. You know I'm a peaceful man."
He says, "That's okay, boy, you just feed him when you can."

[Chorus: Grateful Dead]
Take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And (and, and,) you put the load (Put your load right on me)

[Verse 5: Grateful Dead]
Gonna catch the Cannonball, gonna take me down the line
My bags are sinking low and I do believe it's time
I went back to Miss Fanny, you know she's the only one
Who left me here with her regards for everyone

[Chorus: Grateful Dead]
Take a load off Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off Fanny
And (And, and) you put the load (Put your load right on me)

[Verse 1]
The first days are the hardest days
Don't you worry anymore
'Cause when life looks like Easy Street
There is danger at your door
Think this through with me
Let me know your mind
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Is are you kind?

[Verse 2]
It's a buck dancer's choice, my friends
Better take my advice
You know all the rules by now
And the fire from the ice
Will you come with me?
Won't you come with me?
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Will you come with me?

[Bridge]
Goddamn, well, I declare
Have you seen the like?
Their walls arе built of cannon balls
Their motto is don't tread on me

[Chorus]
Comе hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
It's the same story the crow told me
It's the only one he know
Like the morning sun you come
And like the wind you go
Ain't no time to hate
Barely time to wait
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Where does the time go?

[Verse 4]
I live in a silver mine
And I call it "Beggar's Tomb"
I got me a violin
And I beg you call the tune
Anybody's choice
I can hear your voice
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
How does the song go?

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
A pistol shot at five o'clock
The bells of heaven ring
Tell me what you done it for
No, I won't tell you a thing
Yesterday I begged you
Before I hit the ground
All I leave behind me
Is only what I found

[Verse 2]
If you can abide it
Let the hurdy-gurdy play
Stranger ones have come by here
Before they flew away

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I will not condemn you
Nor yet would I deny
I would ask the same of you
But failing will not die

[Outro]
Take up your china doll
(Take up your china doll)
It's only fractured
Just a little nervous from the fall

Na, na-na-na-na-na-na

[Verse 1]
Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Heads all empty, and I don't care
I saw my baby down by the river
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on, under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my ticket when I speed

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet
She can wade in a drop of dew
She don't come, and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you
She can dance a Cajun rhythm
And jump like a Willys in four-wheel drive
She's my summer love for spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive

Sugar magnolia, ringing that bluebell
Caught up in sunlight
Come on out singing, I'll walk you in the sunshine
Come on, honey, come along with me

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
Lazing in the sunlight? Yes, indeed

[Verse 3]
Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out and I wander around
Walk around

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
One, two, three, four
Sunshine daydream, walk you in the tall trees
We're going through the windows
Blooming, blooming like a red rose
Now come on over sweetly
Ride out singin'; I'll catch you in the morning sunshine
But you gotta come on over here
Sunshine daydream, so come on over daydream
Sunshine daydream, come on over
Sunshine daydream, wading in a cold steam
Crawl on out your window
We're going, going where the wind goes
They're never gonna miss us
Ride out singin', I'll catch you in the morning sunshine
Hey, sunshine daydream
Hey, hey, come and fade away dream
Sunshine daydream, woo-hoo
Sunshine daydream, hey, hey

[Instrumental Break]

Sunshine daydream, hey, hey
Come and fade away dream, hey, hey
Sunshine daydream
Coming from a sweet dream
Sweet, sweet, sweet
Just dream, just dream, dream

[Scarlet Begonias]

[Verse 1]
As I was walking 'round Grosvenor Square
Not a chill to the winter
But a nip to the air
From the other direction
She was calling my eye
It could be an illusion
But I might as well try
Might as well try

[Verse 2]
She had rings on her fingers
And bells on her shoes
And I knew without asking
She was into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias
Tucked into her curls
I knew right away
She was not like other girls
Other girls

[Verse 3]
In the heat of the evening
When the dеaling got rough
She was too pat to open
And too cool to bluff
I picked up my matchеs
And was closing the door
I had one of those flashes
I'd been there before
Been there before

[Bridge]
I ain't often right
But I've never been wrong
It seldom turns out the way
It does in the song
Once in a while
You can get shown the light
In the strangest of places
If you look at it right

[Verse 4]
There ain't nothing wrong
With the way she moves
Or scarlet begonias
Or a touch of the blues
There's nothing wrong with
The look that's in her eye
I had to learn the hard way
To let her pass by
Let her pass by

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
The wind in the willows played tea for two
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue
Strangers stopping strangers
Just to shake their hand
Everybody's playing
In the Heart of Gold Band
Heart of Gold Band

[Instrumental]

[Touch of Grey]

[Verse 1]
Must be getting early
Clocks are running late
Paint by number morning sky looks so phony
Dawn is breaking everywhere
Light a candle, curse the glare
Draw the curtains, I don't care but it's alright

[Chorus]
I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

[Verse 2]
I see you've got your fist out
Say your piece and get out
Yes, I get the gist of it, but it's alright
Well, I have to say
Not really much at play
Every silver lining's got a touch of grey

[Chorus]
I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

[Bridge]
It's a lesson to me
The Ables and the Bakers and the C's
The ABCs we all must face
Try to keep a little grace

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
It's a lesson to me
The Deltas and the East and the Freeze
The ABCs we all think of
Could try to keep a little love

[Verse 3]
I know the rent is in arrears
The dog has not been fed in years
It's even worse than it appears, but it's alright
Cow is given kerosene
Kid can't read at seventeen
The words he knows are all obscene, but it's alright

[Chorus]
I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

[Verse 4]
The shoe is on the hand it fits
There's really nothing much to it
Whistle through your teeth and spit, 'cause it's alright
Oh, well, a touch of grey, kind of suits you anyway
That's all I really had to say, and it's alright

[Chorus]
I will get by
I will get by
I will get by
I will survive

[Outro]
We will get by
We will get by
We will get by
We will survive
We will get by
We will get by
We will get by
We will survive

[Instrumental]

[Fire on the Mountain]

[Verse 1]
Long distance runner, what you standin' there for?
Get up, get on, get out of the door
Playing cold music on the barroom floor
Drowned in your laughter and dead to the core
There's a dragon with matches that's loose on the town
Take a whole pail of water just to cool him down

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Almost ablaze, still you don't feel the heat
It takes all you got just to stay on the beat
You say it's a livin', we all gotta eat
But you're here alone, there's no one to compete
If Mercy's in business, I wish it for you
More than just ashes when your dreams come true

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Long distance runner, what you holdin' out for?
Caught in slow motion in a fall to the floor
The fire from the stage has spread to the floor
You gave all you had, why you wanna give more?
The more that you give, the more it will take
To that thin line beyond which you really can't fake

[Chorus]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! (Fire!) Fire on the mountain!

[Outro]
Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire! (Fire!) Fire on the mountain!
(Well) Fire! Fire on the mountain!
Fire!

[Instrumental]

[China Cat Sunflower]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Look for a while at the china cat sunflower
Proud walking jingle in the midnight sun
Copperdome bodhi drip a silver kimono
Like a crazy quilt stargown through a dream night wind

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Krazy Kat peeking through a lace bandanna
Like a one-eyed cheshire, like a diamond-eye jack
A leaf of all colors plays a golden-string fiddle
To a double-e waterfall over my back

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Comic book colors on a violin river
Crying a lot of words from out a silk trombone
I rang a silent bell, beneath a shower of pearls
In the eagle-winged palace of the Queen Chinee

[Instrumental]

[I Know You Rider]

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Verse 1]
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
My mind was wandering like the wild geese in the West

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
The sun will shine in my back door someday
The sun will shine in my back door someday
March winds will blow all my troubles away

[Verse 3]
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I'd shine my light through the cool Colorado rain

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone, gone, gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone, gone, gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Verse 1]
You needn't gild the lily, offer jewels to the sunset
No one is watching or standing in your shoes
Wash your lonely feet in the river in the morning
Everything promised is delivered to you
Don't neglect to pick up what your share is
All the winter birds are winging home now
Hey Love, go and look around you
Nothing out there you haven't seen before now

[Chorus]
Wade in the water
You never get wet
If you keep on doin' that rag
Wade in the water, you never get wet
If you keep on doin' the rag

[Verse 2]
One-eyed jacks and the deuces are wild
And the aces are crawling up and down your sleeve
Come back here, Baby Louise
And tell me the name of the game that you play

[Refrain]
Is it all fall down?
Is it all go under?
Is it all fall down?
Is it all go under?
Is it all fall down?
All go under?
Is it all fall down?
Is it all go under?
Is it all fall down?
Is it all go under?
All fall down?
Is it all go under?
Woo-hoo, woo-hoo, woo-hoo, woo-hoo

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Everywhere I go, the people all know
Everybody's doin' that rag

[Estimated Prophet]

[Verse 1]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
Been so long I felt this way
I ain't in no hurry, no
Rainbows end down that highway
Where ocean breezes blow
And my time coming, the voices say
And they tell me where I'll go

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't worry about me
Don't worry about me, no
I ain't in no hurry
No, no, 'cause I know where to go

California
Preaching on the burning shore
California
Knock, knocking on the golden door
Like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
You know I'm gonna shine, shine

[Verse 2]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
Been so long I felt this way
Now time sure passing slow
Been so long I felt this way

'Cause them voices tell me what to say
Thеy say where I will go

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about mе, no
I ain't in no hurry
No, no, 'cause I know where to go

California
A prophet on the burning shore
California
Knock, knocking on the golden door
Like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
You know I'm gonna shine, shine

[Bridge]
You've all been asleep, you would not believe me (Ooh, ooh)
Voices come to me, they say you will receive me (Ooh, ooh)
Shining on the beach, the sea will part before me
(Fire wheel burning in the air)
You will follow me, we will rise up to glory, glory
(Way up the middle of the air)
I'll call down thunder and speak the same
My work fills the sky with flame
Might and glory gonna be my name
They gonna light my way

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
Been so long I felt this way
I ain't in no hurry, no
Rainbows end down that highway
Where ocean breezes blow
My time coming, voices say
And they tell me where I'll go

[Outro]
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
I ain't in no hurry
No, no, 'cause I know where to go
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me, no
I ain't in no hurry
No, no, 'cause I know where
I know where, I know where, I know where
I know where, hey, hey, hey
Said I know where, I know where, I know where, I know where, hey
Know where I will go
Know, know, know, where I'ma go
They still know what to say
They say where I should go
Say you'll lead the way, you'll lead the way, lead the way
Hey, na na, where I will go
I know, know, I know, know, know, know, know, know-know
Know where I will go, know, know, know, know
No, no, no

[Terrapin Station]

[Lady with a Fan]

[Verse 1]
Let my inspiration flow
In token rhyme suggesting rhythm
That will not forsake me
'Til my tale is told and done

While the firelight's aglow
Strange shadows from the flames will grow
'Til things we've never seen
Will seem familiar

Shadows of a sailor forming
Winds both foul and fair all swarm
Down in Carlisle, he loved a lady
Many years ago

Here beside him stands a man
A soldier from the looks of him
Who came through many fights
But lost at love

While the storyteller speaks
A door within the fire creaks
Suddenly flies open
And a girl is standing there

Eyes alight with glowing hair
All that fancy paints as fair
She takes her fan and throws it
In the lion's den

"Which of you to gain me, tell
Will risk uncertain pains of hell?
I will not forgive you
If you will not take the chance"

The sailor gave at least a try
The soldier being much too wise
Strategy was his strength
Not disaster

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
The sailor coming out again
The lady fairly leapt at him
That's how it stands today
You decide if he was wise

The storyteller makes no choice
Soon you will not hear his voice
His job is to shed light
Not to master

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Since the end is never told
We pay the teller off in gold
In hopes he will come back
But he cannot be bought or sold

[Terrapin Station]

[Verse]
Inspiration move me brightly
Light the song with sense and color
Hold away despair
More than this I will not ask
Faced with mysteries dark and vast
Statements just seem vain at last
Some rise, some fall, some climb
To get to Terrapin

Counting stars by candlelight
All are dim but one is bright:
The spiral light of Venus
Rising first and shining best
Oh, from the northwest corner
Of a brand new crescent moon
Crickets and cicadas sing
A rare and different tune

[Outro]
Terrapin Station
In the shadow of the moon
Terrapin Station
And I know we'll be there soon
Terrapin - I can't figure out
Terrapin - If it's the end or beginning
Terrapin - But the train's put its brakes on
Terrapin - And the whistle is screaming: Terrapin

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
All I know is something like a bird
Within her sang
All I know she sang a little while
And then flew on

[Refrain]
Tell me all that you know
I'll show you
Snow and rain

[Verse 2]
If you hear that same sweet song again
Will you know why?
Anyone who sings a tune so sweet
Is passing by

[Refrain]
Laugh in the sunshine
Sing
Cry in the dark
Fly through the night

[Chorus]
Don't cry now
Don't you cry
Don't you cry anymore
La-la-la-la
Sleep in the stars
Don't you cry
Dry your eyes on the wind
La-la-la-la, la, la, la

If you hear that same sweet song again
Will you know why?
Anyone who sings a tune so sweet

Laugh in the sunshine
Sing
Cry in the dark
Fly through the night

[Chorus]
Don't cry now
Don't you cry
Don't you cry anymore
La-la-la-la
Sleep in thе stars
Don't you cry
Dry your eyes on the wind
La-la-la-la, la, la

[Verse 5]
All I know is somеthing like a bird
Within her sang
All I know she sang a little while
And then flew on

Tell me all that you know

[Verse 1]
When I was just a little young boy
Papa said "Son, you'll never get far
I'll tell you the reason if you wanna know
'Child of mine, there isn't really very far to go"
Baby, baby wants a gold diamond ring
Wants it more than just any old thing
Well, when I get those jelly roll blues
Why, I'd go and get anything in this world for you
Down to the jewelry store packing a gun
"Wrap it up. I think I'll take this one"
"A thousand dollars please," the jewelry man said
Dupree, he said, "I'll pay this one off to you in lead"

[Chorus]
Well, you know, son, you just can't figure
First thing you know you got to pull that trigger
And it's no wonder your reason goes bad
Jelly roll will drive you stone mad

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Judge said, "Son, it's gonna cost you some time"
Dupree said, "Judge, you know that crossed my mind"
Judge said, "Fact it's gonna cost you your life"
Dupree, he said, "Judge, you know that seems to me to be about right"
Baby, baby's gonna lose her sweet man
Dupree come out with a losing hand
Baby's gonna weep it up for a while
Then go out and find another sweet man's gonna put her in style
Judge said "Son, I know your baby well
But that's a secret I can't ever tell"
Dupree said, "Judge, well, it's well understood
You got to admit that that sweet, sweet jelly's so good"

[Chorus]
Well, you know, son, you just can't figure
First thing you know you're gonna pull that trigger
And it's no wonder your reason goes bad
Jelly roll will drive you stone mad

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Same old story and I know it's been told
Some like jelly jelly, some like gold
Many a man's done a terrible thing
Just to get baby a shiny diamond ring

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Come on you pretty women
With your hair hanging down
Open up your windows
'Cause the Candyman's in town
Come on, boys, and gamble
Roll those laughing bones
Seven come eleven, boys
I'll take your money home

[Chorus]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again

[Verse 2]
I come in from Memphis
Where I learned to talk the jive
When I get back to Memphis
Be onе less man alive
Good morning, Mr. Benson
I see you'rе doing well
If I had me a dollar
I'd blow you straight to hell

[Chorus]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again

[Verse 3]
Come on, boys, and gamble
If you have got the time
If you've got a dollar, boys
Lay it on the line
Hand me my old guitar
Pass the whiskey 'round
Won't you tell everybody you meet
That the Candyman's in town

[Chorus]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again

[Outro]
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again
Look out, look out, the Candyman
Here he come and he's gone again
Pretty lady ain't got no friend
'Til the Candyman comes around again

[Verse 1]
Julie catch a rabbit by his hair
Come back stepping, like to walk on air
Get back home where you belong
Don't you run off no more

Don't hang your head and let the two time roll
Grass shack nailed to a pine wood floor
Ask the time, baby, I don't know
Come back later, gonna let it show

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Instrumental Break]

Here's a half a dollar if you dare
Double twist when you hit the air
Look at Julie, down below
The levee doing the do-pas-o

Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row

[Instrumental Break]

Broken heart don't feel so bad
You ain't got half of what you thought you had
Rock your baby to and fro
Not too fast and not too slow

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna gеt there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row

[Bridge]
That's thе way it's been in town
Ever since they tore the jukebox down
Two-bit piece don't buy no more
Not so much as it done before

[Chorus]
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row
And I say row, Jimmy, row
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row
And I say row (Row, row), Jimmy, row (Row, row)
Gonna get there? I don't know
Seems a common way to go
Get down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Outro]
Get down, row
Row, row, row, row
Oh, get down and row
Row, row, row, row

[Verse 1]
No, no, she can't take your mind and leave
I know it's just another trick she's got up her sleeve
Well, I can't believe that she really wants you to die
After all it's more than enough to pay for your lie

[Chorus]
Wait a minute, watch what you're doing with your time
All the endless ruins of the past must stay behind, yeah

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Wait a minute, watch what you're doing with your time
All the endless ruins of the past must stay behind, yeah

[Verse 2]
Well, can't you see that you're killing each other's soul
Well, you're both out in the streets and you got no place to go
Well, your constant battles are getting to be a bore
So go somewhere else and continue your cream puff war

[Instrumental]

[Lazy Lightning]

[Verse 1]
Lazy lightning
That sleepy fire in your eyes
Is that desire in disguise?
I keep on trying but I
I can't get through
Lazy lightning
I'd like to find the proper potion
To try to capture your emotion
You're right beside me but I
I can't get through

[Chorus]
You're a loop of lazy lightning
Loop of lazy lighting
Must admit you're kind of frightening
But you really get me high

[Verse 2]
So exciting
When I hear your velvet thunder
You seem so near I start to wonder
Would you come closer if I
If I asked you to
So exciting
The way you're messing with my reason
It's an obsession but it's pleasing
Tell mе a lie and I will swear
I'll swear it's truе

[Chorus]
You're a loop of lazy lightning
Loop of lazy lightning
Must admit you're kind of frightening
You're a loop of lazy lightning

[Bridge]
Rope of fire round my heart (Lightning)
Rope of fire ever tightening (Tightening)
Rope of fire round my heart (Lightning)
Come on, come on, lazy lightning (Ooh)
You're a loop of lazy lightning, woo

[Chorus]
You're a loop of lazy lightning
Loop of lazy lightning
Must admit you're kind of frightening

[Verse 3]
So inviting
Way your power strikes in one place
...that case
I'd fly a kite if I
I thought it'd do
So inviting
Way your power electrifies me
Someday I know you'll satisfy me
And all that lightning will be

[Outro]
(My lightning too)
My lightning too

Loop of lazy lightning
(My lightning too)
Loop of lazy lightning
(My lightning too)
My lightning too

My lightning too

You're a loop of lazy lightning

Woo

[Supplication]

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
Well, dizzy ain't the word for the way that you're making me feel now
Well, I need some indication, girl, if all of this is real now
You got to tell me, girl
Well, I've heard here there's something wrong in my head now
Got to help me, girl
Could it be infatuation or am I just being misled now?

[Outro]
Little bolt of inspiration
Way you strike me now
It's sparking my imagination
Got to like me now
It cause me such excitation
Don't you fight me now
It got to be my supplication
Got to like me now
Little bolt of inspiration
Way you strike me now
It cause me such excitation
Go on, fight me now

[Instrumental Break]

Woo

[Help on the Way]

[Verse 1]
Paradise waits
On the crest of a wave, her angels in flames
She has no pain
Like a child she's pure, she is not to blame
Wings spread bright, take that flight
Spring from night into the sun
Don't stop to run
She can fly like a lie, she can't be outdone
Tell me the cost
I would pay, let me go, tell me love is not lost
Sell everything
Without love day to day insanity's king
I will pay, day by day
Anyway, lock, bolt and key
Crippled but free
I was blind all the time, I was learning to see

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Help on the way
Well, I know only this, I'vе got you today
Don't fly away
'Cause I love what I love and I want it that way
I will stay onе more day
Anyway, honey, it's you
Making it too
Without love in a dream, it'll never come true

[Franklin's Tower]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
In another time's forgotten space
Your eyes looked through your mother's face
Wildflower seeds in the sand and wind
May the four winds blow you home again

[Chorus]
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I'll tell you where the four winds dwell
In Franklin's tower there hangs a bell
It can ring, turn night to day
Can ring like fire if you lose your way

[Chorus]
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew

[Verse 3]
God save the child who rings that bell
Might have one good ring, baby, you can't tell
One watch by night, one watch by day
If you get confused, listen to the music play

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
Some come to laugh their past away
Some come to make it just one more day
Whichever way your pleasure tends
If you plant ice, you're gonna harvest wind

[Chorus]
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
I'll tell you where the four winds sleep
Like four lean hounds the lighthouse keep
Wildflower seed in the sand and stone
May the four winds blow you safely home

[Outro]
Roll away the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
(Roll) Roll away (Roll away) the dew
(You better) Roll away (Roll away) the dew
(You better) Roll away (Roll away) the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
(You'd better) Roll away (Roll away) the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
(You'd better) Roll away (Roll away) the dew
(You'd better)  Roll away the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew
Roll away (Roll away) the dew

[Instrumental]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I can't stay much longer, Melinda, the sun is getting high
I can't help you with your troubles, if you won't help with mine
I gotta get down, I gotta get down, I gotta get down to, to the mine

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
You keep me up just one more night, I can't sleep here no more
Little Ben clock says quarter to eight; you kept me up 'til four
I gotta get down, I gotta get down, or I can't work there no more

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
A lot of poor man make a five dollar bill, keep him happy all the time
Some other fella's making nothing at all, and you can hear him cry
"Can I go, buddy, can I go down take your shift at the mine?"

[Bridge]
Gotta get down to thе Cumberland mine
Gotta get down to thе Cumberland mine
That's where I mainly spend my time
Make good money, five dollars a day
Made anymore, I might move away

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
A lotta poor man got the Cumberland blues, he can't win for losing
A lotta poor man got to walk the line just to pay his union dues
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again
I don't know now, I just don't know if I'm going back again

[Verse 1]
There's mosquitoes on the river
Fish are rising up like birds
And it's been hot for seven weeks now
Too hot to even speak now
Did you hear what I just heard?
It might have been a fiddle (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Or it could have been the wind (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
But there seems to be a beat now (Ooh)
I can feel it my feet now (Ooh, ooh)
Listen, here it comes again

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a band out on the highway (Out on the highway)
They're high-stepping into town (Well, they're dancing into town)
It's a rainbow full of sound
And it's fireworks, calliopes and clowns
Everybody's dancing

[Chorus]
Come on children, come on children
Come on and clap your hands

[Verse 2]
Well, the sun went down in honey
And the moon came up in wine
And stars were spinning dizzy
Lord, the band kept us so busy
We forgot about the time
They're a band beyond description
Like Jehovah's favorite choir
People joining hand in hand
While the music plays the band
Lord, they're setting us on fire
Crazy rooster crowing midnight (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Balls of lightning roll along (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Old men sing about their dreams (Ooh)
Women laugh and children scream (Ooh, ooh)
And the band keeps playing on

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep on dancing through the daylight
(Keep on dancing through the daylight)
And greet the morning air with song
(Greet the morning air with song)
No ones's noticed but the band's all packed and gone
Were they ever here at all? (Were they ever here at all?)
But they kept on dancing

[Chorus]
Come on children, come on children
Come on, clap your hands

[Outro]
Well, the cool breeze came on Tuesday
And the corn's a bumper crop
And the fields are full of dancing
Full of singing and romancing
The music never stopped

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine
We can share what we got of yours 'cause we done shared all of mine
Keep on rollin', just a mile to go
Keep on rollin' my old buddy, you're movin' much too slow

[Verse 2: Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir]
I just jumped the watchman, right outside the fence
Took his rings, four bucks in change, now ain't that Heaven sent?
Hurts my ears to listen, and it burns my eyes to see
You cut down a man in cold blood, Shannon, might as well've been me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3: Bob Weir]
Used to play for silver, now we play for life
One's for sport, one's for blood at the point of a knife
Now the die is shaken, now the die must fall
Ain't a winner in the game, he don't go home with all
Not with all

[Verse 4: The Grateful Dead]
Leavin' Texas, fourth day of July
Sun so hot, the clouds so low, the eagles filled the sky
Catch the Detroit Lightning out of Santa Fe
Great Northern out of Cheyenne, from sea to shining sea

[Verse 5: Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir]
Gotta go to Tulsa, first train we can ride
Gotta settle one old score, one small point of pride
Ain't a place a man can hide, Shannon, will keep him from the sun
Even a bed can't give us rest now, you keep us on the run

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 6: The Grateful Dead]
Jack Straw from Wichita
Cut his buddy down
And dug for him a shallow grave
And laid his body down
Half a mile from Tucson
By the morning light
One man gone and another to go
My old buddy, you're moving much too slow

[Outro: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine

[Verse 1]
Look out of any window
Any morning, any evening, any day
Maybe the sun is shining
Birds are winging or rain is falling from a heavy sky

[Chorus 1]
What do you want me to do
To do for you to see you through?
For this is all a dream we dreamed
One afternoon, long ago

[Verse 2]
Walk out of any doorway
Feel your way, feel your way like the day before
Maybe you'll find direction
Around some corner where it's been waiting to meet you

[Chorus 2]
What do you want me to do
To do for you to see you through?
For this is all a dream

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Look into any eyes you find by you
You can see clear to another day
Maybe it's been seen before through other eyes
On other days while going home

[Chorus 3]
What do you want me to do
To do for you to see you through?
It's all a dream we dreamed
One afternoon, long ago

[Verse 4]
Walk into splintered sunlight
Inch your way through dead dreams to another land
Maybe you're tired and broken
Your tongue is twisted with the words half spoken and thoughts unclear

[Chorus 4]
What do you want me to do
To do for you to see you through?
A box of rain will ease the pain
And love will see you through

[Outro]
Just a box of rain
Wind and water
Believe it if you need it
And if you don't, just pass it on
Sun and shower, wind and rain
In and out the window like a moth before a flame
Just a box of rain
I don't know who put it there
Believe it if you need it
Or leave it if you dare
And it's just a box of rain
Or a ribbon for your hair
Such a long, long time to be gone
And a short time to be there

[Chorus]
Comes a time when the blind man takes your hand, says "Don't you see?
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe."
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup only love can fill
Only love can fill

[Verse 1]
Been walking all morning, been walking all night
I can't see much difference between the dark and light
I feel the wind, and I taste the rain
Never in my mind to cause so much pain

[Chorus]
Comes a time when the blind man takes your hand, says "Don't you see?
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe."
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup only love can fill
That only lovе can fill

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Comes a time when thе blind man takes your hand, says "Don't you see?
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe."
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup only love can fill
That only love can fill

[Verse 2]
From day to day just letting it ride
You get so far away from how it feels inside
You can't let go 'cause you're afraid to fall
But the day may come when you can't feel at all

[Chorus]
Comes a time when the blind man takes your hand, says "Don't you see?
Gotta make it somehow on the dreams you still believe."
Don't give it up, you got an empty cup only love can fill
Only love can fill

[Outro]
Only love can fill
Only love can fill

[Instrumental]

This next portion of the show is all—is dedicated for all you folks out there that are fans of the key of E

[Victim or the Crime]

[Verse 1]
Patience runs out on the bunny
The dark side hires another soul
Did he steal his fate or earn it?
Was he force fed? Did he learn it?
Whatever happened to his precious self control?
Like him, I'm tired of trying to heal
This tomcat heart with which I'm blessed
Is destruction loving's twin?
Must I choose to lose or win?
Maybe when my turn comes I will have guessed
These are the horns of the dilemma
What truth this proof against all lies?
When sacred fails before profane
The wisest man is deemed insane
Even the purest of romantics compromise

[Chorus]
What fixation feeds this fever?
As the full moon pales and climbs
Am I living truth or rank deceiver?
Am I the victim or the crime?
Am I the victim or the crime?
Am I the victim or the crime, or the crime?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
And so I wrestle with the angel
To see who'll reap the seeds I sow
Am I the driver or the driven?
Will I be damned to be forgiven?
Is there anybody here but me who needs to know?

[Chorus]
What it is that feeds this fever
As the full moon pales and climbs?
Am I living truth or rank deceiver?
Am I the victim or the crime?
Am I the victim or the crime?
Am I the victim or the crime?
Am I the victim or the crime, or the crime?

[Instrumental]

[Foolish Heart]

[Verse 1]
Carve your name
Carve your name in ice and wind
Never flow
Look to where the river ends
Or where the river starts

[Chorus]
Everything that's in you
You think to be your part
Never give your love, my friend
Unto a foolish heart
Unto a foolish heart

[Verse 2]
Learn to leap
Leap from ledges high and wild
Learn to speak
Speak with wisdom like a child
Directly to the heart

[Chorus]
Crown yourself the king of clowns
Or stand way back apart
But never give your love, my friend
Unto a foolish heart
Unto a foolish heart

[Verse 3]
Shun a friend
Shun a brother and a friend
Never look
Never look around the bend
Or check the weather chart

[Chorus]
Everything within in you
You think could be your part
But never give your love, my friends
Unto a foolish heart
Unto a foolish heart

[Bridge]
A foolish heart will call you...
Turn around and blame you
For the way you went astray
A foolish heart will cost you sleep
And most make you curse
A selfish heart is trouble
But a foolish heart is worse

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
Bite the hand
Bite the hand that bakes your bread
Dare to land
Where the angels fear to tread
'Til you are torn apart

[Chorus]
Everything that...
...part
Never give your love, my friends
Unto a foolish heart
Unto a foolish heart

[Outro]
Unto a foolish heart
Unto a foolish heart
Unto a foolish heart
Unto a foolish heart

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I woke today, felt your side of the bed
The covers were still warm where you'd been layin'
You were gone, my heart was filled with dread
You might not be sleeping here again

[Chorus]
But it's alright, 'cause I love you
And that's not gonna change
Run me around, make me hurt again and again
But I'll still sing you love songs
Written in the letters of your name
And brave the storm to come
For it surely looks like rain

[Verse 2]
Did you ever waken to the sound of street cats making love?
You guess from their cries you were listening to a fight
Well, you know, oh, hate's just the last thing they're thinking of
You're only tryin' to make it through the night

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I only wanna hold you, I don't wanna tie you down
Or fit you in the lines I might've drawn
It's just that I, I, I have gotten used to havin' you around
My landscape would be empty if you were gone

[Chorus]
But it's alright, 'cause I love you
And that's not gonna change
Run me around, make me hurt again and again
But I'll still sing you love songs
Written in the letters of your name
And brave the storm to come
For it surely looks like rain

[Outro]
(Brave the storm to come)
Brave the storm to come, 'cause it looks like rain
Yes, and brave the storm to come
('Cause it looks like rain)
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Here comes the rain
(Brave the storm to come)
Brave the storm to come
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Here the comes the rain
Brave the storm to come
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Here comes the rain
Yes, and brave the storm to come
('Cause it looks like rain)
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh
Here comes the rain
Yes, and brave the storm to come
('Cause it looks like rain)
'Cause it looks like rain and it feels like rain, oh, oh
Here comes the rain
(It looks like rain)
Here comes the rain

[Verse 1]
To lay me down, once more
To lay me down
With my head in sparkling clover
Let the world go by, all lost in dreaming
To lay me down, one last time
To lay me down

[Chorus]
To lay me down, oh, oh
To lay me down
To lay me down, one last time
To lay me down

To lay me down, whoa-oh
To lay me down
To lay me down, one last time
To lay me down

To lie with you, once more
To lie with you
With our dreams entwined together
Let the world beside, my love still sleeping
To tell sweet lies, one last time, and say good night

[Chorus]
To lay me down, whoa-oh
To lay me down
To lay me down, one last time
To lay me down

[Outro]
To lay me down, one last time
To lay me down, one last time
To lay me down, one last time

[Cryptical Envelopment/Quodlibet For Tender Feet]

[Verse]
The other day they waited, the sky was dark and faded
Solemnly they stated, "He has to die"
With all the children learnin', from books that they were burnin’
Every leaf was turnin' to watch him die

Summer sun looked down on him, his mother could but frown on him
And all the others sound on him, but it doesn't seem to matter
And when the day had ended, with rainbow colors blended
His mind remained unbended, he had to die

[Instrumental]

[The Faster We Go, the Rounder We Get]

[Verse 1]
Spanish lady comes to me, she lays on me this rose
It rainbow spirals round and round it trembles and explodes
It left a smoking crater of my mind I like to blow away
But the heat come ’round and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day

[Chorus]
Comin', comin', comin' around (Comin' around)
Comin' around (Comin' around)
Comin' (Comin’), comin’ (Comin'), comin’ around (Comin' around)
Comin' around (Comin' around)

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Skippin’ through the lily fields I came across an empty space
It trembled and exploded, left a bus stop in its place
The bus came by and I got on, that's when it all began
There was Cowboy Neal at the wheel of the bus to Never Ever Land

[Chorus]
Comin', comin', comin' around (Comin' around)
Comin' around (Comin' around)
Comin' (Comin'), comin' (Comin'), comin' around (Comin' around)
Comin' around (Comin' around)

[Verse 1]
Went to see the captain, strangest I could find
Laid my proposition down, laid it on the line
I won't slave for beggar's pay, likewise gold and jewels
But I would slave to learn the way to sink your ship of fools

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Verse 2]
Saw your first ship sink and drown
From rocking of the boat
And all that could not sink or swim
Was just left there to float
I won't leave you drifting down, but whoa, it makes me wild
With thirty years upon my head
To have you call me child

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first beliеved you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruеl sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Verse 3]
The bottle stand as empty
As it was filled before
Time there was and plenty
But from that cup no more
Though I could not caution all
I still might warn a few
Don't lend your hand to raise no flag atop no ship of fools

[Chorus]
Ship of fools on a cruel sea
Ship of fools sail away from me
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Outro]
It was later than I thought when I first believed you
Now I cannot share your laughter, ship of fools

[Verse 1]
Annie laid her head down in the roses
She had ribbons, ribbons, ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I could not leave her there

[Chorus]
I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I could not leave her there

[Verse 2]
Ten years the waves rolled the ships home from the sea
Thinking well how it may blow in all good company
If I tell another what your own lips told to mе
Let me lay 'neath thе roses, let my eyes no longer see

[Chorus]
I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I could not leave her there

[Verse 3]
One pane of glass in the window
No one is complaining though
Come in and shut the door
Faded is the crimson from the ribbons that she wore
And it's strange how no one comes 'round anymore

[Chorus]
I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I could not leave her there

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I could not leave her there

[Verse 1]
The first days are the hardest days
Don't you worry anymore
'Cause when life looks like Easy Street
There is danger at your door
Think this through with me
Let me know your mind
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Is are you kind?

[Verse 2]
It's a buck dancer's choice, my friends
Better take my advice
You know all the rules by now
And the fire from the ice
Will you come with me?
Won't you come with me?
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Will you come with me?

[Bridge]
Goddamn, well, I declare
Have you seen the like?
Their walls are built of cannon balls
Their motto is don't tread on me

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come with me or go alone
He's come to take his children home

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
It's the same story the crow told me
It's the only one he know
Like the morning sun you come
And like the wind you go
Ain't no time to hate
Barely time to wait
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
Where does the time go?

[Verse 4]
I live in a silver mine
And I call it "Beggar's Tomb"
I got me a violin
And I beg you call the tune
Anybody's choice
I can hear your voice
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
How does the song go?

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain]
Whoa-oh, what I want to know
How does the song go?

[Chorus]
Come hear Uncle John's Band
By the riverside
Got some things to talk about
Here beside the rising tide
Come hear Uncle John's Band
Playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone
He's come to take his children home

[Verse 1]
My brother Esau killed a hunter
Back in 1969
Before the killing was done
His inheritance was mine
But his birthright was a wand to wave
Before a weary band
Esau gave me sleeplessness
And a piece of moral land

[Verse 2]
My father favored Esau
Who was eager to obey
All the bloody wild commandments
The Old Man shot his way
But all this favor ended when
My brother failed at war
He staggered home
And found me in the door

[Chorus]
Esau skates on mirrors anymore
Meets his pale rеflection in the door
Yet somеtimes at night I dream
He's still that hairy man
Shadowboxing the Apocalypse
And wandering the land
Shadowboxing the Apocalypse
And wandering the land

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Esau holds a blessing
Brother Esau holds a curse
Would say the blame was mine
But I suspect it's something worse
The more my brother looks like me
The more I understand
The silent war that bloodied both our hands
Sometimes at night, I think I understand
Way late at night, more feel they understand

[Outro]
Brother to brother, man to man
Face to face and let's hand to hand
Fight a war that never ends
Maybe up again
Shadowboxing the Apocalypse within
Silent war within
Shadowboxing the Apocalypse, yet again, and again
Shadowboxing the Apocalypse
And wandering the land, hey
Shadowboxing the Apocalypse
And wandering the land
Shadowboxing the Apocalypse
And wandering the land

[Intro]
One, two, one, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Firefly, can you see me?
Shine on, glowing, brief and brightly
Could you imagine one summer day
That same night be on your way
Do you remember? Hearts were too cold
The seasons have frozen us into our souls
People were saying the whole world is burning
Ashes have scattered too hard to turn

[Chorus]
Upside out, inside down
False alarm, the only game in town
No man's land, the only game in town
Terrible, the only game in town

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Passenger, don't you hear me?
Destination seen unclearly
What is a man deep down inside
But a raging beast with nothing to hide

[Chorus]
Upside out, inside down
False alarm, the only game in town
No man's land, the only game in town
Terrible, the only game in town

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Upside out, inside down
False alarm, the only game in town
No man's land, the only game in town
Terrible, the only game in town

[Verse 1]
On the day when I was born, Daddy sat down and cried
I had the mark just as plain as day that could not be denied
They say that Cain caught Abel rolling loaded dice
Ace of Spades behind his ear and him not thinking twice

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
They say that when your ship comes in, the first man takes the sails
Second takes the afterdeck, the third, the planks and rails
What's the point of calling shots
This cue ain't straight in line
Cuе balls made of Styrofoam and no one's got the timе

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
If all you got to live for is what you left behind
Get yourself a powder charge and seal that silver mine
Lost my boots in transit, baby, pile of smoking leather
I nailed a retread to my feet and prayed for better weather

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way, on my way

[Instrumental Break]

Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river

[Lost Sailor]

[Verse 1]
Compass card is spinnin'
Your elm is swingin' to and fro
Ooh, where's the dog star?
Ooh, where's the moon?

[Chorus]
You're a lost sailor
You've been way too long at sea

[Verse 2]
Some days the gales are howling
Some days the sea is still as glass
Ooh, reef the main sail
Ooh, lash the mast

[Chorus]
You're a lost sailor
You've been way too long at sea
Now the shore lights beckon
You say there's a price for being free

[Bridge]
Hear the seabirds cryin'
And there's a ghost wind blowin'
And it's calling you to that misty swirling sea
'Til the chains of your dreams are broken
No place in this world you can be

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
You're a lost sailor
Been way too long at sea
Now the shore lights beckon
Yeah, there's a price for being free

[Outro]
You pay for being free
I tell you free don't come easy
Free don't always come for free now
Sometimes it's hard to know what to believe in
Where to go, who to go, where to be, who to be
That's means you're drifting
Drifting, yeah, drifting and dreaming
Maybe going on a dream now
Maybe going on a feeling
Drifting, drifting and dreaming, yeah
'Cause there's a place you've never been
Maybe a place you've never seen now
You can hear them calling on the wind, on the wind
Drifting and dreaming, drifting and dreaming, yeah
Go on and drift your life away, hey, hey, hey, hey
Go on and drift your life away now, drifting and dreaming
Go on and follow that dream now
Maybe going on a dream now, maybe going on a dream now
Maybe going a feeling, maybe going on a feeling
Feeling, feeling

[Saint of Circumstance]

[Verse 1]
Well, this must be heaven
Tonight I cross the line
You must be an angel
I thought I might never find
Was it you I heard singing
Oh, when I was chasing dreams?
Driven by the wind
Like the dust that blows around now

[Chorus]
When the rain fallin' down
Never know now

[Verse 2]
Got to be heaven
'Cause here's where the rainbows end
If this ain't the real thing
Well, it's close enough to pretend
But when that wind blows
When the night's about to fall
I can hear the sirens call
It's a certain sort of sound

[Chorus]
When the rain fallin' down now
Rain fallin' down, rain fallin' down

[Bridge]
Holes in what's left of my reason
Holes in the knees of my blues
Odds against me been increasin'
But I'll pull through
I never could read no road map
No, I don't know what the weather might do
But hear that witch wind whinin'
See that dog star shinin'
I've got a feelin' there's no time to lose
No time to lose

[Instrumental Break]

I never know now
Just don't ever know, no

[Verse 3]
Released from heaven
But even rainbows will end
Now my sails are fillin'
And the wind is willin'
And I'm good as gone again
I'm still walkin', so I'm sure that I can dance
Just a Saint of Circumstance
Like a tiger in a trance
In the rain fallin' down now
Rain' fallin' down (Rain' fallin' down)
Rain' fallin' down now (Rain' fallin' down)
Rain' fallin' down now (Rain' fallin' down)
Rain' fallin' down now (Rain' fallin' down)
Rain' fallin' down now (Rain' fallin' down)
Rain fallin' down

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Well, I never know now
No, never know, no, no
Listen
I sure don't know what I'm going for
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
I sure don't know what I'm going for
But I'm gonna go for it for sure (Got to)
I sure don't know what I'm going for
(Just don't know, no, it's hard to say)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
('Cause something makes me do it anyway, you know)
I sure don't know what I'm going for
(No, I never, never know, no)
But I'm going to go for it for sure
('Cause I gotta, gotta, gotta go)
I sure don't know what I'm going for
(Top of the mountain you can see far and wide now)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
(But you still can't see that other mountain's other side now)
I sure don't know what I'm going for
(So maybe I just go on a dream now)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
(Maybe going on a feeling)
I sure don't know what I'm going for
(I'd like to know, how about you now, how about you?)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
(What the fuck you gonna do now?)
I sure don't know what I'm going for
(Maybe just going on a dream now, hey)
But I'm gonna go for it for sure
(Maybe going on a feeling, maybe going on a feeling)

[Intro]
Three, five, seven, eight, nine, ten

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust nothing
But I know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh, I hope you understand
When it's done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Just looking for their kites
But I can tell your future
Oh, look what's in your hand
But I can't stop for nothing
I'm just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep a-turning
While I'm playing in the band
And if a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybrеak on the land

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybrеak on the land
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land
Playing
Like a wave upon the sand
Daybreak
While I'm playing in the band

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
We're gonna take a short break, and we'll be back in just a few minutes, and we'll see you all then, so hang loose

[Verse 1]
Right outside this lazy summer home
Ain't got time to call your soul a critic, no
Right outside the lazy gate of winter's summer home
Wondering where the nut-thatch winters
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
There comes a rеdeemer, and he slowly too fades away
And follows a wagon bеside him that's loaded with clay
The seeds that were silent all burst into bloom, and decay
And night comes so quiet, it's close on the heels of the day

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Live no particular way but our own
Sometimes we visit your country and live in your home
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own

[Outro]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental]

[Intro]
One, two, three, four

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Verse 1]
This old engine
Makes it on time
Leaves Central Station
At a quarter to nine
Hits river junction
At seventeen to
Quarter to ten
You know it's traveling again

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Verse 2]
Trouble ahead
A lady in red
Take my advice
You'd be bеtter off dead
Switch-man sleeping
Train hundred and two
Is on thе wrong track
And headed for you

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Trouble with you
Trouble with me
Got two good eyes
But we still don't see
Come 'round the bend
You know it's the end
The fireman screams
And the engine just gleams

[Chorus]
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones you better, watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[Outro]
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

Hey folks, we're gonna take a short break a few minutes and we'll be back, and we'll see you then

[Verse 1]
Well, I was feeling so bad
I asked my family doctor about what I had
I said, "Doctor (Doctor), Mister M.D. (Doctor)
Can you tell me (Doctor), what's ailing me?" (Doctor)

[Chorus]
And he said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah" (Yes, he did)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
All I need, all I need, ow (Good lovin')
'Cause all I need is lovin' (Good lovin')
Early in the morning, baby (Good lovin')
Late in the evening one more time (Good lovin')

[Verse 2]
Come on, baby, squeeze me tight
Don't you want your daddy just to be alright?
I said baby (Baby), that's for sure (Baby)
I've got the fever (Baby), you got the cure (Baby)

[Chorus]
And she said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah" (Yes, she did)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
All I need, all I need (Good lovin')
All I need is lovin' (Good lovin')
Early in the morning, baby (Good lovin')
Late in the evening one more time (Good lovin')
Go on now

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
Going out on a four-day creep
I know I get lonesome, begin to weep
Four days, four long days
Four long days without no love
I can't stand it no more
I can't stand it no more now, no
I can't stand it, I can't stand it no more
I can't go out, baby, on a four-day creep
All I want is love, can't get no sleep
Sit around and watch the TV
Drink a whole bunch of whiskey
That all I've got but never the love can try to find me, I need your love
I'd just like to have a summer
I just got to get summer lovin' now
I'll get her back, I'm wantin' the lovin'
It's all I need
Old lady tell about it
Come on now
It gets so lonesome in a strange old town
It gets kinda lonely in a strange old town sometime
And I'm gonna go out, I don't care what my old lady say
I'm gonna out in my mind to play
I don't find nothing of a four-day creep
I take four, five days and then tearfully weep
I got to find some, I got to find some love
I got to find some, I got to find some love
Yes, I do now; I just can't wait no longer
I'm coming to the end of my rope, I can't wait no longer
I'm coming to the end of my rope, I need some hope
I'm at the end of my rope, I need some hope now, darling
Need just a little bit more hope
You make me feel fine, you make me feel fine, you make me feel fine
Just a little wine on me
Sometime when my old lady decide that she gonna go out
Sometime when she decides she gonna leave
I just sit around the house and wonder what to do
You know, I don't like to mess with nobody else's old lady
Word get around the neighborhood pretty fast
And I tell all them people that I'm a good man
I think I just might have to move a little fast
Just a-move little fast
But I'm built for comfort, not for speed
Got everything a woman might need
But I can't stand it no more, I just
I got to get a little bit of love
Can't stand it no more, I just — it's all I'm thinkin' of
And I think I might have some hope
Baby, this ain't no joke
I think I might have a little hope now, darling
Baby, this ain't no joke
You make me feel so good
You make me feel so fine
Only two times, only two times, only two times
I got to make her three or four
I got to make her three or four or more
And one of them reasons, one of them reasons
One of them reasons she make me feel so good
She make me feel so nice
One of the things that make me feel so good
It's just because, just because, just because, just because
She's got box back nitties, great big enormous thighs
Working undercover with a boar hog eye
Yes, she does; yes, she does; yes, she does; yes, ow
She got overdrive, she got overdrive
She got overdrive, and it keep me alive
Overdrive keep me alive in the morning, in the afternoon
Overdrive keep me alive in the morning and late in the evening too
I can't ever think about her two times, got to think about her three or four more
I woke up in the morning now when I hear her knocking on my door
Come on in, sit on down, said, "Daddy, what you want me to do?"
Turn on over, give me your shoulder, I told you
Everything you want, ooh
You know some folks said she must be a Cadillac
Some folks say she must be a Cadillac
But I say she got to be a T-Model Ford
She got to be a T-Model Ford
She got to be a T-Model Ford
She got to be a T-Model Ford
She got the shades, alright
Sure carry something heavy, though, a-yes, she can
A-yes, she can
You know she can, ow
Coming to California, hey, yes, I know
Drive to California, got a big love
I, I may need more love
I, I may need more love, yes, I do
Yes, I do

And I feel so down
I ain't had no lovin' in a long time
I ain't had no lovin' in a long time
And I feel like somebody put a spell on me
Feel like somebody put a spell on me
But I believe I found a way to break that spell
I believe I found a way to break that spell, yes, I did
Yes, I did
And it's just seeming I got myself an idea
Just seeming I got an idea, yes, I did
I ain't gonna tell you about it, though
You'll find out next time I see you
Next time she go out on a four-day creep
Next time I ain't gonna sit home and weep
I got an electric company on the side, an electrical company
An electric company on the side, an electrical company
I could hop on my pony and ride
I'm gonna hop on and pony and ride
I'm gonna hop on my pony and ride, ride
Hop on my pony and ride, ow
I was feeling so bad, I was needing something

[Verse 3]
And I was feeling so bad
I asked my family doctor about what I had
I say, "Doctor (Doctor), Mister M.D. (Doctor)
Can you tell me (Doctor), what's ailing me?" (Doctor)

[Chorus]
And he said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah" (Yes, he did)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
All I need, all I need (Good lovin')
All I need is lovin' (Good lovin')
Early in the morning, baby (Good lovin')
Late in the evening one more time (Good lovin')

[Verse 4]
Come on, baby, squeeze me tight
Don't you want your daddy just to be alright?
I said baby (Baby), that's for sure (Baby)
I've got the fever (Baby), you got the cure (Baby)

[Chorus]
And then she said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah" (Yes, she did)
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah"
All I need, all I need, ow (Good lovin')
All I need is lovin' (Good lovin')
Early in the morning, baby (Good lovin')
Late in the evening one more time (Good lovin')

[Outro]
That's all I need

Thank you

In case you just joined us on the air, welcome to the second set. And, uh, we're doing just like it sounds like we're doing. Right now, we're tuning up. I might take this opportunity to tell all you folks here tonight that, uh, this is really a nice theater. It's one of the very few finest in the country, if not in the world, and it's a good place to have a rock and roll show. And, and the owners of the theater hope that you won't, you know, be careless and rip it up so that we can, you know, keep coming back and other groups can keep coming here. 

[Instrumental] (Hold everything. Thank you.) We seem to be having some intonation difficulties. (Now we're gonna try to get in tune.) Wait a, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. I mean, I mean, we can't play when it sounds like that. You seem like reasonable people, surely you understand. Amenably, you see the, uh, organ and the piano are not in tune with each other. (We don't need that big bright light.) And so when this happens, the stage tunes up with the organ and then tunes up with the piano. You say something about a light? (Yeah. I just want some red lights on.) Gold's okay, too; gold's okay, too. (That's just 'cause you think it makes you look sexy.)

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
Escaping through the lily fields, I came across an empty space
It trembled and exploded, left a bus stop in its place
The bus come by and I got on, that's when it all began
There was Cowboy Neal at the wheel of the bus to Never Ever Land

[Outro]
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)
Coming (Coming), coming (Coming), coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I wanna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
You know our love will not fade away
You know our love will not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show you but you drive me back
Your love for me has got to be real
You're gonna know just how I feel
Our love is real, not fade away
Not fade away

[Instrumental]

In a hundred years not dare would I
Pull a Pharcyde, let you pass me by
Nothin' like your last guy, he too square for you
He don't smack that ass and pull your hair like that

For you to salute the true big pimpin'
Not many women can refuse this pimpin'
I'm a nice guy, but don't get it confused, this pimpin'

[Verse 1]
I had a hard run
Running from your window
I was all night running
Lord, I wonder if you care
I had a hard run
Run around and a-run down
Run around a corner
Lord, I run smack into a tree

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don’t you come around here anymore

[Verse 2]
Dressed myself in green
I went back under the trees
Try to see what's going down
Lord, and read between the lines
I had a feeling I was falling, falling, falling
I turned around to see
Heard a voice calling
You was running back to me

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don’t you come around here anymore

[Verse 4]
Ran into a rainstorm
I ducked back into a bar door
It was all night pouring
Not a drop on mе
Test me, test mе
Why don't you arrest me?
Throw me in the jail house, jail house
Lord, until the sun goes down
'Til it go down

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please

I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don’t you come around here anymore

I had to move
Really had to move
That’s why if you please

Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore

Well, we just went into our first equipment malfunction, you all will be pleased to know

[Verse 1]
Me and my uncle went riding down
South Colorado, west Texas bound
We stopped over in Santa Fe
That being the point just about halfway
And you know it was the hottest part of the day

[Verse 2]
I took the horses up to the stall
Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all
Three days in the saddle, you know my body hurt
It being summer, I took off my shirt
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt

[Verse 3]
West Texas cowboys, well, they's all around
With liquor and money, they's loaded down
Soon after payday, know it seemed a shame
You know my uncle, he starts a friendly game
Hey now, high-low jack and thе winner take the hand

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
My unclе start winning; cowboys got sore
One of them called him, and then two more
Accused him of cheating; well, oh no, it couldn't be
I know my uncle, he's as honest as me
Hey, I'm as honest as a Denver man can be, that's me
One of them cowboys, he starts to draw
I shot him down, Lord, he never saw
Shot me another, hot damn, he won't grow old
In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold
Hey, we high-tailed it down to Mexico

[Outro]
I love those cowboys, I love their gold
I love my uncle, God rest his soul
He taught me good, Lord, taught me all I know
Taught me so well, I grabbed that gold
And I left his dead ass there by the side of the road

Thank you

[Verse 1]
I take a little powder, take a little salt
Put it in my shotgun, and I go walkin' out

[Chorus]
Jubba jubba (Jubba jubba), woolly bully (Woolly bully)
Looking high (Looking high), looking low (Looking low)
Gonna scare you up and shoot ya, 'cause Mister Charlie told me so

[Verse 2]
I won't take your life, won't even take a limb
I just unload my shotgun, take a little skin

[Chorus]
Jubba jubba (Jubba jubba), woolly bully (Woolly bully)
Looking high (Looking high), looking low (Looking low)
Gonna scare you up and shoot ya, Mister Charlie told me so

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, you take a silver dollar, take a silver dime
Mix it up together in some alligator wine
I can hear the drums, voodoo on my lawn
Mister Charlie tellin' me, I can't do nothin' wrong

[Chorus]
Jubba jubba (Jubba jubba), woolly bully (Woolly bully)
Looking high (Looking high), looking low (Looking low)
Gonna scare you up and shoot ya, 'cause Mister Charlie told me so

[Verse 4]
Mistеr Charlie told me, thought you'd like to know
I'll givе you a little warning, before I let you go

[Chorus]
Jubba jubba (Jubba jubba), woolly bully (Woolly bully)
Looking high (Looking high), looking low (Looking low)
Gonna scare you up and shoot ya, Mister Charlie told me so

[Outro]
Gonna scare you up and shoot ya, 'cause Mister Charlie told me
Mister Charlie told me so

[Verse 1]
If I had a gun for every ace I have drawn
I could arm a town the size of Abilene
Don't you push me, baby, 'cause I'm moaning low
And you know I'm only in it for the gold

All that I am asking for is ten gold dollars
I could pay you back with one good hand
You can look around about the wide world over
And you'll never find another honest man

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down

[Verse 2]
Don't you push me, baby, because I'm moaning low
But I know a little something you won't ever know
Don't you touch hard liquor, just a cup of cold coffee
Gonna get up in the morning and go
Everybody's bragging and drinking that winе
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way shе shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
I've got no chance of losing this time

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Last fair deal in the country (Sweet Suzie)
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold money where your love is, baby
Before you let my deal go down, go down

[Outro]
Everybody's bragging and drinking that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on an inside straight
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
Well, I've got no chance of losing this time
I've got no chance of losing this time

Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them that you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree

You thought you was the cool fool
Never could do no wrong
You had everything sewn up tight
How come you lay awake all night long?

Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree
Grate

(Loose FRAP, loose FRAP, hold everything) Ladies and gentlemen, we got a loose FRAP. That's short for Flat Response Audio Pickup, and uh, well, you can't know how great the situation is, and they're gonna have to melt some wax and replace it. It's all much too complex for words but it'll be done real shortly. So you people listening on the radio, all this hummin' and buzzin', and cracklin' and hissin' and poppin' is all electric mayhem, and you can just sorta run to the refrigerator and grab something. Do whatever it is you do, you know, do a channel scan on the TV

[Verse 1]
My mama told me, my papa told me, too
Well, my mama told me, papa told me, too
Well, I shouldn't be here trying to sing these railroad blues

Wish I had a-listened to what my mama said
Wish I had a-listened, oh, to what my mama said
And I wouldn't be here trying to sleep in this cold iron bed, no

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
I went to the depot, never got there on time
Went down to the depot, never got there on time
Well, that train's going down, she's rolling down the line

Mister jailer, go away now, don't tell me no lies
Mister jailer, go away now, don't tell me no lies
Well, my train's going down, she's rolling down the line

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
My mama told me, my papa told me, too

Well, I wouldn't be here trying to sleep in this cold iron bed

[Verse 1: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine
We can share what we got of yours 'cause we done shared all of mine
Keep on rollin’, just a mile to go
Keep on rollin' my old buddy, you're movin’ much too slow

[Verse 2: Bob Weir]
I just jumped the watchman, right outside the fence
Took his rings, four bucks in change, now ain't that Heaven sent?
Hurts my ears to listen, Shannon, it burns my eyes to see
You cut down a man in cold blood, Shannon, might as well've been me

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3: Bob Weir]
Used to play for silver, now we play for life
One's for sport, one's for blood at the point of a knifе
Now the die is shaken, now thе die must fall
Ain't a winner in this game, he don't go home with all
With all

[Verse 4: The Grateful Dead]
Leavin' Texas, fourth day of July
Sun so hot, the clouds so low, the eagles filled the sky
Catch the Detroit Lightning out of Santa Fe
The Great Northern out of Cheyenne, from sea to shining sea

[Verse 5: Bob Weir]
Gotta go to Tulsa, first train we can ride
Gotta settle one old score, one small point of pride
There ain’t no place a man can hide will keep him from the sun
Ain’t no bed can give us rest now, you keep us on the run

[Instrumental]

[Verse 6: The Grateful Dead]
Jack Straw from Wichita
Cut his buddy down
And dug for him a shallow grave
And laid his body down
Half a mile from Tucson
By the morning light
One man gone and another to go
My old buddy, you're moving much too slow

[Outro: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine

[Verse]
Next time you see me, things won't be the same
Next time you see me, things won't be the same
If it hurts you, my darling, you only got yourself to blame

Well, it's a true, true saying, all that shines is not gold
Well, it's a true, true saying, all that shines is not gold
Like the good book say, you gotta just reap what you sow

[Chorus]
Well, you lied, cheated — whoa-oh — for so long
Well, you lied, cheated — whoa-oh — for so long
You were wrong to do it, woman, and another queen is on your throne

[Instrumental break with harmonica solo]

[Chorus]
Well, you lied, cheated — whoa-oh — for so long
Well, you lied, cheated — whoa-oh — for so long
You were wrong to do it, woman, and another queen is on your throne

[Outro]
Next time you see me, things won't be the same
Next time you see me, things won't be the same
If it hurts you, my darling, you only got yourself to blame
Well, it's a true, true saying, all that shines is not gold
Well, it's a true, true saying, all that shines is not gold
Like the good book say, you gotta just reap what you sow

Thank you

[Verse 1]
Rich man step on my poor head
When you get back you better butter my bread
Well, you know it's like I said
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Verse 2]
Drink all day and rock all night
The law come to get you if you don't walk right
Letter this morning, all that it read
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Drink all day and rock all night
The law come to get you if you don't walk right
Catch a few winks, baby, down under the bed
Then you head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Verse 4]
Dropped four flights and cracked my spine
Honey, come quick with the iodine
Well, you know, it's like I said
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Instrumental]

[Verse 5]
I run into Charlie Phogg
He blacked my eye and he kicked my dog
My dog, he turned to me and he said:
Better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Verse 6]
I woke up feeling mean
I went down to play the slot machine
The wheels turned around and the letters read:
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Verse 1]
Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Night time would find me in Rosa's Cantina
Music would play and Felina would whirl

Black as the night were the eyes of Felina
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was strong for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain I could tell

[Bridge]
One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina, the girl that I love
So in anger

[Verse 2]
I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor
Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run

[Bridge]
Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I picked a good one, he looked like he could run
Up on his back and away I did ride
Just as fast as I

[Verse 3]
Could from the West Texas town of El Paso
Out through the badlands of New Mexico
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life, nothing is left
But it's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death

[Bridge]
I saddled up and away I did go, riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart
And at last here I

[Verse 4]
Am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's Cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Felina I go

Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me
I've got to make it to Rosa's back door

[Bridge]
Something is dreadfully wrong, for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
It's getting harder to stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary, unable to ride
But my love for

[Verse 5]
Felina is strong
And I writhe where I've fallen
Though I am weary, I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

From out of nowhere, Felina has found me
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss and Felina goodbye

[Outro]
Thank you

[Verse 1]
Fare you well, my honey
Fare you well, my only true one
All the birds that were singing
Have flown except you alone

Going to leave this brokedown palace
On my hands and my knees, I will roll, roll, roll
Make myself a bed by the waterside
In my time - in my time - I will roll, roll roll

[Chorus]
In a bed, in a bed
By the waterside I will lay my head
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

[Verse 2]
River gonna sing me
Sing me sweet and sleepy
Sing me sweet and sleepy
All the way back home (Doo-doo-doo)
It's a far gone lullaby sung many months ago
Mama, Mama, many worlds I'vе come
Since I first left homе

[Chorus]
Going home, going home
By the waterside I will lay my bones
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Going to plant a weeping willow
On the bank's green edge it will grow, grow, grow
Sing a lullaby beside the water
Lovers come and go - the river roll, roll, roll

[Chorus]
Fare you well, fare you well
I love you more than words can tell
Listen to the river sing sweet songs
To rock my soul

[Harmonizing]

[Outro]
Monitors sound beautiful, just beautiful

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust nothing
But I know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh, I hope you understand
When it's done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Just looking for their kites
But I can tell your future
Oh, just look what's in your hand
But I can't stop for nothing
I'm just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep a-turning
While I'm playing in the band
And if a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land
Playing
Playing in thе band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land
Playing
Likе a wave upon the sand
Daybreak
While I'm playing in the band

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Out of all the reindeer, you know you're the mastermind
Run, run Rudolph, Randolph ain't too far behind

[Chorus]
Run, run Rudolph, Santa 's got to make it to town
Tell him he can hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
And away went Rudolph, whippin' like a merry-go-round

[Verse 2]
Said Santa to a poor child, "What have you been longing for?"
He said "All I want for Christmas is a Rock and Roll electric guitar"
And away went Rudolph whizzing like a shooting star

[Chorus]
Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down
Run, run Rudolph, I'm whizzing like a merry-go-round
Alright

[Chorus]
Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
Can't you tell him hurry? Tell him he can take the freeway down
And away went Rudolph, running like a merry-go-round

[Verse 3]
Said Santa to a girl, "Child, what would you like most to get?"
"I want a little baby doll that can cry, еat, sleep, and wet"
And away went Rudolph, whizzing like a Sabеr jet

[Chorus]
Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
Can't you make him hurry? Tell him he can take the freeway down
And away went Rudolph, spinning like a merry-go-round

[Outro]
Run, run Rudolph; run, run Rudolph, run
Run, run Rudolph; run, run Rudolph, run
Can't you make him hurry? Tell him he can take the freeway down
A-run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it
Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it
Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town
Can't you make him hurry? Tell him he can take the freeway down

Thank you

[Verse 1]
Since it cost a lot to win
And even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time
Wondering what to choose

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down, no no

[Verse 2]
I've been gambling hereabouts
For ten good solid years
If I told you all that went down
It would burn off both your ears

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Since you poured the wine for me
And tightened up my shoes
I hate to leave you sitting there
Composing lonesome blues

[Pre-Chorus]
It goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down, oh no

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
Since it cost a lot to win
And even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time

Watch each card you play
And play it slow

[Chorus]
Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down

Don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come 'round

Wait until that deal come 'round
Don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down, no, no

[Verse 1]
Sugar magnolia, blossoms blooming
Heads all empty, and I don't care
Saw my baby down by the river
Knew she'd have to come up soon for air

Sweet blossom come on, under the willow
We can have high times if you'll abide
We can discover the wonders of nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my ticket when I speed

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
She comes skimmin' through rays of violet
Shе can wade in a drop of dew
She don't comе and I don't follow
Waits backstage while I sing to you
She can dance a Cajun rhythm
Jump like a Willys in four-wheel drive
She's my summer love for spring, fall, and winter
She can make happy any man alive

Sugar magnolia, ringing that bluebell
While caught up in sunlight
Come on out singing, I'll walk you in the sunshine
Come on, honey, come along with me

[Chorus]
She's got everything delightful
She's got everything I need
A breeze in the pines and the sun and bright moonlight
Lazing in the sunlight? Yes, indeed

[Verse 3]
Sometimes when the cuckoo's crying
When the moon is halfway down
Sometimes when the night is dying
I take me out, and I wander around
Walk around

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
One, two, three, four
Sunshine daydream, walk you in the tall trees
We're going where the wind goes
Hey, blooming like a red rose
Roll on over sweetly
And ride out singin', I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream
Walk me in the tall trees
We're going where the wind goes
Hey, blooming, hey, blooming like a red rose
Roll on over sweetly
And ride out singin', I'll walk you in the morning sunshine
Sunshine daydream, sunshine daydream
Sweet darling daydream
Sunshine daydream, roll on over and daydream
Sunshine daydream, sweet loving daydream
Sunshine daydream, from a sweet loving daydream
Come on over and daydream
Come on over and daydream
From a sunshine daydream, from a sweet loving daydream
Sunshine daydream, yeah, ah-ho
From a sweet loving daydream, yeah, ah-ho
Yeah, ah-ho; yeah, ah-ho
Sweet loving daydream

[Intro]
And this number rose straight to top of the charts in Turlock, California, number one, numero uno I'll have you know. And so all I'm trying to say is I wish you folks out there would get hip and buy our new single
(A-one, a-two, one, two, three, four)

[Chorus 1]
Truckin', got my chips cashed in
Keep truckin', like the do-dah man
Together, more or less in line
Just keep truckin' on

[Verse 1]
Arrows of neon and flashing marquees out on Main Street
Chicago, New York, Detroit and it's all on the same street
Your typical city involved in a typical daydream
Hang it up and see what tomorrow brings

[Chorus 2]
Dallas, got a soft machine
Houston, too close to New Orleans
New York got the ways and means
But just won't let you be, oh no

[Verse 2]
Most of the cats you meet on the street speak of true love
Most of the time they're sittin' and cryin' at home
One of these days they know they better get goin'
Out of the door and down on the street all alone

[Chorus 3]
Truckin', like the do-dah man
Once told me "You've got to play your hand"
And sometimes your cards ain't worth a dime
If you don't lay 'em down

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Verse 3]
What in the world ever became of sweet Jane?
She lost her sparkle, you know she isn't the same
Livin' on reds, and vitamin C, and cocaine
All her friend can say is "Ain't it a shame"

[Chorus 4]
Truckin', up to Buffalo
I've been thinkin', you got to mellow slow
It takes time to pick a place to go
And just keep truckin' on

[Verse 4]
You're sittin' and starin' out of the hotel window
Got a tip they're gonna kick the door in again
I'd like to get some sleep before I travel
But if you got a warrant, I guess you're gonna come in

[Chorus 5]
Busted, down on Bourbon Street
Set up, like a bowling pin
Knocked down, it gets to wearin' thin
They just won't let you be

[Verse 5]
You're sick of hangin' around and you'd like to travel
Get tired of travelin' and you want to settle down
I guess they can't revoke your soul for tryin'
Get out of the door and light out and look all around

[Bridge]
Sometimes the light's all shinin' on me
Other times I can barely see
Lately it occurs to me
What a long, strange trip it's been

[Outro]
Truckin', I'ma goin' home
Whoa whoa, baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Ah, get back truckin' on
Ah, get back truckin' on
Wah, get back truckin' on
Go on now, hey

[Instrumental]

Truckin', I'ma goin' home
Whoa whoa, baby, back where I belong
Back home, sit down and patch my bones
And get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on
Wah, get back truckin' on
Wah, get back truckin' on
Ah, get back truckin' on
Hey now, get back truckin' on

[Instrumental]

[Verse]
Spanish lady come to me, she lays on me this rose
It rainbow spirals round and round, it trembles and explodes
It left a smoking crater of my mind I like to blow away
Well, heat come 'round and busted me for smiling on a cloudy day

[Chorus]
Coming, coming, coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)
Coming (Coming), coming (Coming), coming around (Coming around)
Coming around (Coming around)

Mississippi River, so big and wide
Blond-haired woman on the other side
Now she's gone, gone, gone, and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world

I saw her in Dallas and El Paso
Said, "Come back, baby, I need you so"
And now she's gone, gone, gone, and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world

Don't come here running, holding out your hand
'Cause I have me a woman and I can't be your man
Now she's gone, gone, gone, and I don't worry
'Cause I'm sitting on top of the world

Thank you. Good night, folks

[Verse 1]
Went down to the mountain, I was drinking some wine
Looked up into heaven, Lord, I saw a mighty sign
Writ in fire across the heaven, plain as black and white
Get prepared 'cause there's gonna be a party tonight

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey, Saturday night
Hey, uh-huh, one more Saturday night
Hey, Saturday night

[Verse 2]
Everybody's dancing down the local armory
With a basement full of dynamite and live artillery
The temperature keeps rising, everybody getting high
Come the rocking stroke of midnight, whole placе is going to fly

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey, Saturday night
Hey, uh-huh, one morе Saturday night
Hey, Saturday night

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
I turn on Channel 6, the President comes on the news
Says, "I get no satisfaction, that's why I sing the blues"
His wife say "Don't get crazy 'cause you know just what to do
Crank up that old Victrola, put on your rocking shoes"

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey, Saturday Night
Hey, uh-huh, one more Saturday night
Hey, Saturday night

[Verse 4]
Then God way up in heaven, for whatever it was worth
Thought He'd have a big old party, thought He'd call it Planet Earth
I may be young and crazy but I don't see reason one
For fightin' and complaining, Lord, we should be having fun

[Chorus]
Uh-huh, hey, Saturday Night
Hey, uh-huh, one more Saturday night
Ow, Saturday night

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Hanging on a Saturday night
Hanging on a Saturday night
Everybody get right
Hanging on a Saturday night
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night, woo
Hanging on a Saturday night
Hanging on a Saturday night
Wha-hoo
Hanging on a Saturday night
One more Saturday night, one more Saturday night, woo
Hanging on a Saturday night
Hanging on a Saturday night
Ah, ah
Hanging on a Saturday night
One more Saturday, one more Saturday night, woo-hoo

Good night, folks

[Verse 1]
Some folks trust to reason
Others trust to might
I don't trust nothing
But I know it come out right
Say it once again now
Oh, I hope you understand
When it's done and over
Lord, a man is just a man

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Verse 2]
Some folks look for answers
Others look for fights
Some folks up in treetops
Just looking for their kites
And I can tell your future
Oh, just look what's in your hand
But I can't stop for nothing
I'm just playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Standing on a tower
World at my command
You just keep turning
While I'm playing in the band
And if a man among you
Got no sin upon his hand
Let him cast a stone at me
For playing in the band

[Chorus]
Playing
Playing in the band
Daybreak
Daybreak on the land

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Inside you're burning
I can see clear through
Your eyes tell more than you mean them to
Lit up and flashing
Like the reds and blues
Out there on the neon avenue
Still I

[Chorus]
(Feel like a stranger)
Feel like a stranger

[Verse 2]
Well, the music's thundering
We're reckless and hot
You keep firing glances across the room
And I can't stop wondering
Just what you got
Get the feeling I'm gonna find out real soon, soon
Still I

[Chorus]
(Feel like a stranger)
Ooh, just like, just like, just like a stranger

[Refrain]
You know it's gonna get stranger
Something things we just know

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
And so the wheel
Gets smoking 'round midnight
You shoot me a look that says "Let's go"
Yes, and it feels most like we're running a red light
There ain't no point in looking behind us, no, no
Still I

[Chorus]
(Feel like a stranger)
Just like, just like, just like a stranger

[Outro]
You know it's gonna get stranger
Let's get on with the show
Ooh, feel like a stranger
Just like, just like, just like a stranger
How about you?
(Feel like a stranger)
Gettin' strange for you, too
(Feel like a stranger)
Just like, just like, just like, just like a stranger
(Feel like a stranger)
Just like a, just like, just like a stranger, woo
(Feel like a stranger)
Just like, just like a stranger
(Feel like a stranger)
(Gonna be a long, long, crazy, crazy night)
Crazy night (Crazy night)
(Feel like a stranger)
(Long, long, crazy) Long, long, crazy (Crazy), crazy night
(Crazy, crazy night)
(Feel like a stranger)
(Long, long, crazy, crazy night) Long, long, crazy, crazy night
(Long, long, crazy, crazy night)
(Feel like a stranger)
(Gonna be a long, crazy night)
Silky, silky crazy, crazy night (Silky, silky, crazy, crazy night)

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Good, good morning, so good to see you
You weren't just a dream of mine
Real as a raven, real as thunder
Real as the sun shining
But still so very undefined
Can't imagine what's behind those sleepy eyes
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Little stranger, don't try to hide now
You look so young when you're afraid
There is no danger, but from the devil
He may want you, but I'm in his way

[Chorus]
You don't know how easy it is
You don't know how easy it is to love you
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 3]
Here come the moonrise when the dew falls
Don't be the sun that fades away
Don't leave me darkness, she is no lover
She hides the day

[Chorus]
You don't know how easy it is
You don't know how easy it is to love you

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Good, good morning, so good to see you
You weren't just a dream of mine
Real as a raven, real as thunder
Real as the sun shining
But still so very undefined
Can't imagine what's behind those sleepy eyes

[Chorus]
You don't know how easy it is
You don't know how easy it is to love you

[Outro]
You don't know how easy it is
(You don't know how)
You don't know how easy it is to love you
(You don't know how easy it is)
You don't know how easy it is
(You don't know how easy, easy it is)
You don't know how easy it is to love you
(Easy it is)
You don't know how easy it is
You don't know how easy it is to love you
(Let me show you how)
You don't know how easy it is
(Let me show you how)
You don't know how easy it is to love you
(How easy it is to love, baby; how easy it is to love you)
You don't know how easy it is
(You don't know how, you don't know how)
You don't know how easy it is to love you
(Easy it is)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
Well, this job I've got is a little too hard
Well, uh-huh, I'm running out of money, Lord, I need more pay
Gonna wake up in the morning, Lord, I'm gonna pack my bag
I'm gonna beat it on down the line

[Chorus 1]
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
I'm going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Hey, I'm going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Beat it on down the line

[Verse 2]
Yes, and I'll be waiting at the station, Lord, whеn that train pulls on by
Well, I, I'm going back where I bеlong
Oh yes, and I'm going north to my same old used-to-be
Uh-huh, down in Joe Brown's coal mine

[Chorus 2]
I said coal mine (Coal mine)
I said coal mine (Coal mine)
I said coal mine (Coal mine)
I said coal mine (Coal mine)
Said, said coal mine (Coal mine)
Hey, hey (Coal mine)
Coal mine, now, down in Joe Brown's coal mine

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Yes, I'm going back to that shack way across the railroad track
Uh-huh, that's where I think I belong
Oh yes, I got a sweet woman, oh yes, waiting there for me
Oh yes, and that's where I'm gonna make my happy home

[Outro]
I said happy home (Happy home)
I said happy home (Happy home)
I said a happy home (Happy home)
Said a happy, said a happy (Happy home)
Happy, happy, happy home (Happy home)
Said a happy, said a happy (Happy home)
Happy home, now, that's where I'm gonna make my happy home

[Verse 1]
There was a wealthy merchant, in London he did dwell
He had a beautiful daughter, the truth to you I'll tell
Oh, the truth to you I'll tell
She had sweethearts a plenty, and men of high degree
But none but Jack the sailor, her true love ever be
Oh, her true love ever be
Now, Jackie's gone a sailing, with trouble on his mind
He's left his native country and his darling girl behind
Oh, his darling girl behind
She went down to a tailor shop and drеssed in man's array
She climbed on board a vеssel to convey herself away
Oh, convey herself away

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Before you get on board, sir, your name we'd like to know
She smiled on her countenance, they call me Jack-a-roe
Oh, they call me Jack-a-roe
I see your waist is slender, your fingers they are small
Your cheeks too red and rosy to face the cannonball
Oh, to face the cannonball
I know my waist is slender, my fingers they are small
But it would not make me tremble to see ten thousand fall
Oh, to see ten thousand fall

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
The war soon being over, she went and looked around
Among the dead and wounded her darling boy she found
Oh, her darling boy she found
She picked him up on in her arms and carried him to the town
She sent for a physician to quickly heal his wounds
Oh, to quickly heal his wounds
This couple they got married so well they did agree
This couple they got married, so why not you and me?
Oh, why not you and me?
Oh, why not you and me?

[Verse 1]
I told you once and I told you twice
But you never listen to my advice
You don't try very hard to please me
With what you know it should be easy

[Chorus]
Well, this could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time
I don't know, oh no

[Verse 2]
Sorry, girl, but I can't stay
Feeling like I do today
It's too much pain and too much sorrow
Guess I'll feel the same tomorrow

[Chorus]
Well, this could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time
I don't know, oh no

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
I told you once and I told you twice
That someone will have to pay the pricе
But here's a chance to changе your mind
Because I'll be gone a long, long time

[Chorus]
Well, this could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time
I don't know, oh no

[Outro]
No, I don't know, I don't know
Could be the last time
(This could be the last time)
I don't know, maybe the last time
(This could be the last time)
I don't know, maybe the last time, baby
(This could be the last time)
I don't know, maybe the last time, baby
(This could be the last time)
I don't know, I don't know
(This could be the last time)
I don't know, I don't know
(This could be the last time)
I don't know, could be the last time
(This could be the last time)
I don't know, I don't, I don't, I don't
(This could be the last time)
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, ah

[Verse 1]
All I know is something like a bird
Within her sang
All I know she sang a little while
And then flew on

[Refrain]
Tell me all that you know
I'll show you
Snow and rain

[Verse 2]
If you hear that same sweet song again
Will you know why?
Anyone who sings a tune so sweet
Is passing by

[Refrain]
Laugh in the sunshine
Sing
Cry in the dark
Fly through the night

[Chorus]
Don't cry now
Don't you cry
Don't you cry anymore
La-la-la-la
Sleep in the stars
Don't you cry
Dry your eyes on the wind
La-la-la-la, la

[Verse 3]
All I know is something like a bird
Within her sang
All I know she sang a little while
And then flew on

[Refrain]
Tell me all that you know
I'll show you
Snow and rain

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Don't cry now
Don't you cry
Don't you cry anymore
La-la-la-la
Sleep in the stars
Don't you cry
Dry your eyes on the wind
La-la-la-la, la

[Verse 4]
All I know is something like a bird
Within her sang
All I know she sang a little while
And then flew on

[Outro]
Tell me all that you know
I'll show you
Snow and rain
Snow and rain
Snow and rain
Snow and rain

[Verse 1]
A man and a woman come together as strangers
When they part they're usually strangers still
It's like a practical joke played on us by our maker
Empty bottles that can't be filled

[Chorus]
Baby, who's to say it should have been different now that it's done
(Baby, who's to say)
Baby, who's to say it should have been anyway
Baby, who's to say that it even matters in the long run
(Baby, who's to say)
Give it just a minute
And it'll blow away, it'll blow away

[Verse 2]
You fancy me to be the master of your feelings
You barely bruise me with your looks to kill
I admit we were sometimes brutal in our dealings
I never held you against your will

[Chorus]
Baby, who's to say it should have been different now that it's done
(Baby, who's to say)
Baby, who's to say it should have been anyway
Baby, who's to say that it even matters in the long run
(Baby, who's to say)
Give it just a minute
It'll blow away

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Your case against me is so very clearly stated
I plead no contest, I just turn and shrug
I've come to figure all importance overestimated
You must mean water when you get on your knees and you beg me for blood

[Chorus]
Baby, who's to say it should have been different now that it's done
(Baby, who's to say)
Baby, who's to say it should have been anyway
Baby, who's to say that it even matters in the long run
(Baby, who's to say)
Give it just a minute
It'll blow away, it'll blow away

[Outro]
Like a feather in a whirlwind (Blow away)
Just as surely as the world spins (Blow away)
Oh, it'll blow away (Blow away)
Ooh, it'll blow
Give it just, give it just, give it just a little minute, baby
Give it just, give it just, give it just a little minute now
Oh, it'll blow away, yeah
Oh, it'll blow, it'll blow, it'll blow, it'll blow away
Hey, hey, oh, it'll blow, it'll blow away, hey
Blow away it will
Wait

[Instrumental]

Give it just a little second now
Give me just one little piece of your time
I don't wanna leave, I don't wanna stay
I don't wanna, I don't wanna hear, man
Just one little second of your time
I got something to say
I got something for you to hear
So listen close, listen close
Listen up, listen, listen, I want you to hear
It's like you got your fist closed tight
It's like you got blood right here in your fist
And you're balling your fist close, tight to your chest
It's like you wanna push it in, it's like you wanna push it in deep
It's like you wanna push it deep inside
It's like you wanna push it deep inside your heart, inside your heart
Deep if you can
It's like you wanna keep it in your heart
It's like you wanna keep it there forever, never let it go
Never let it go
But where you think your rib cage is in yourself
It's not gonna keep love in, maybe it'll keep love out
But it won't keep it there
Do you wanna know real love?
Do you wanna know real love?
Real love, real love, real love, keep it simple
Real love you gon' hang on to
Real love, you could let go, you could let it fly
It comes right back to you, that's real love
Real, real, real, real, real, real, real love
Do me a favor, help me out, oh, come on and help me out
Take that fist, and shove it in the air
Take your fingers and open 'em up, open 'em up one at a time
Who gives a shit, just open 'em up
And let it breathe so long, let it breathe right now
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool breeze along
Let it blow away
Let it blow, let it blow, let it blow, let it blow away
Let it blow, let it blow, let it blow away
Real love, real love, go to real love, real love 'cause it's on its way
Real love, real love, real, real love, real love is on its way
It's on its way, it's on its way, it's on its way, it's on its way
It's on, oh its way

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
Been so long I felt this way
I ain’t in no hurry, no
Rainbows end down that highway
Where ocean breezes blow
My time coming, the voices say
And they tell me where I'll go

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't worry about me
No, no, don’t worry about me, no
I ain't in no hurry
No, no, 'cause I know where to go

[Chorus]
California
Preaching on the burning shore
California
Knock, knocking on the golden door
Like an angel
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
You know I'm gonna shine (Shine), shine

[Verse 2]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
Been so long I felt this way
I ain't in no hurry, no
Voices tell me what to say
They tell me wherе I'll go
Know I, know I lead the way
Them voicеs tell me so

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't worry about me
No, no, don’t worry about me, no
Don’t worry about me
No, no, 'cause I know, ’cause I know, I know

[Chorus]
California
A prophet on the burning shore
California
Knocking, knocking on the golden door
Like an angel (Hey)
Standing in a shaft of light
Rising up to paradise
You know I'm gonna shine (Shine)
Know I'm gonna shine

[Bridge]
Now, you've all been asleep, you would not believe me (Ooh, ooh)
Voices telling me, they tell me you’ll receive me (Ooh, ooh)
Shining on the beach, the sea will part before me
(Fire wheel burning in the air)
You will follow me, we will rise up to glory
(Way up the middle of the air)
And I'll call down thunder and speak the same
My work fills the sky with flame
Might and glory be my name, my name
They gonna light my way, yeah, yeah

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
My time coming, any day
Don't worry about me, no
Been so long I felt this way
I ain't in no hurry
Voices tell me what to say
They tell me where to go
Oh, I know I lead the way
Oh, I know, oh, I know, I...

[Outro]
Don't worry about me
Don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me
No, no, don't worry about me
Voices tell me what to say
They say I lead the way
They say I lead the way, hey, hey
I know where to go
I know where I'm knocking
I know, know, know where I'm not
I know, know where I'm not, not, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, na na na

[Instrumental]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Right outside this lazy summer home
Ain't got time to call your soul a critic, no
Right outside the lazy gate of winter's summer home
Wondering where the nut-thatch winters
Wings a mile long just carried the bird away

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
There comes a rеdeemer, and he slowly too fades away
Follows a wagon bеhind him that's loaded with clay
Seeds that were silent all burst into bloom, and decay
And night comes so quiet, it's close on the heels of the day

[Chorus]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Sometimes we live no particular way but our own
Sometimes we visit your country and live in your home
Sometimes we ride on your horses, sometimes we walk alone
Sometimes the songs that we hear are just songs of our own

[Outro]
Wake up to find out that you are the eyes of the world
The heart has its beaches, its homeland and thoughts of its own
Wake now, discover that you are the song that the morning brings
The heart has its seasons, its evenings and songs of its own

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
In the attics of my life
Full of cloudy dreams unreal
Full of tastes no tongue can know
And lights no eyes can see
When there was no ear to hear
You sang to me

[Verse 2]
I have spent my life
Seeking all that's still unsung
Bent my ears to hear the tune
And closed my eyes to see
When there were no strings to play
You played to me

[Bridge]
In the book of love's own dreams
Where all the print is blood
Where all the pages arе my days
And all my nights grow old
When I had no wings to fly
You flew to me
You flеw to me, to me

[Verse 3]
In the secret space of dreams
Where I dreaming lay amazed
When the secrets are all told
And the petals all unfold
When there was no dream of mine
You dreamed of me

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
An ancient business, a modern piece of glasswork
Down on the corner that you walk each day in passing
The elderly sales clerk won't eye us with suspicion
The whole, immortal corporation’s given its permission

[Verse 2]
A little stairway, a little piece of carpet
A pair of mirrors that are facing one another
Out in both directions, a thousand little Julias
That come together in the middle of Manhattan

[Pre-Chorus]
You waited since lunch
It all comes at once

[Chorus]
Ah-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
Ah-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ah-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
Oh, sweet thing
Zion doesn't love You
And Babylon don't love You
But You love everything
Oh, You saint
America don't love You
So I could never love You
In spite of everything

[Pre-Chorus]
In the dark of this place
There's the glow of Your face
There's the dust on the screen
Of this broken machine
And I can't help but feel
That I've made some mistake
But I let it go
Ya Hey, Ya Hey, Ya Hey

[Chorus]
Through the fire and through the flames
(Ya Hey, Ya Hey)
(Ut Deo, Ya Hey)
(Ut Deo, Deo)
You won't even say Your name
(Ya Hey, Ya Hey)
(Ut Deo, Ya Hey)
(Ut Deo, Deo)
Through the fire and through the flames
You won't even say Your name
Only "I am that I am"
But who could ever live that way?
(Ya Hey, Ya Hey)
Ut Deo, Ya Hey
Ut Deo, Deo

[Verse 2]
Oh, the motherland don't love You
The fatherland don't love You
So why love anything?
Oh, good God
The faithless, they don't love You
The zealous hearts don't love You
And that's not gonna change

[Pre-Chorus]
All the cameras and files
All the paranoid styles
All the tension and fear
Of a secret career
And I can't help but feel
That You seen the mistakes
But You let it go
Ya Hey, Ya Hey, Ya Hey

[Chorus]
Through the fire and through the flames
(Ya Hey, Ya Hey)
(Ut Deo, Ya Hey)
(Ut Deo, Deo)
You won't even say Your name
(Ya Hey, Ya Hey)
(Ut Deo, Ya Hey)
(Ut Deo, Deo)
Through the fire and through the flames
You won't even say Your name
You say, "I am that I am"
But who could ever live that way?
(Ya Hey, Ya Hey)
Ut Deo, Ya Hey
Ut Deo, Deo

[Verse 1]
Unsentimental, traveling around
Sure of myself, sure of it now
But you were standing there so close to me
Like the future was supposed to be
In the aisles of the grocery
And the blocks uptown
I remember, remember it well
I remember, remember it well
In the shadow of your first attack
I was questioning and looking back
You said, "Baby, we don't speak of that"
Like a real aristocrat
In the shadow of your first attack
I was questioning and looking back
You said, "Baby, we don't speak of that"
Like a real aristocrat

[Bridge]
In the shadow of your first attack
In the shadow of your first attack
In the shadow of your first attack
In the shadow of your first attack
In the shadow of your first attack
In the shadow of your first attack
In the shadow of your first attack
In the shadow- Shadow of your shadow- Shadow- Shadow
In the shadow of your first attack
In the shadow of your first attack
In the shadow of your first attack
In the shadow of your first attack

'Cause, honey, with you-ooh-ooh-ooh
Is the only honest way to go
And I could take two-ooh-ooh-ooh
But I really couldn't ever know
Honey, with you-ooh-ooh-ooh
And a little bata radio
We could try
And a little bata radio

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
That night I smoked a joint with my best friend
I smoked a joint with my best friend
I smoked a joint with my best friend
I smoked a joint with my best friend
I smoked a joint with my best friend
I smoked a joint with my best friend
I smoked a joint with my best friend

Pack up your troubles
Forget all your problems
Remember the times
We made it together
So happy and free
So happy, it's a new day

It's been a long time
You know that I love you
I've got to be near you
I need all your loving
You've got to believe me
We build a new life

Isn't it funny, oh
How the times they change
I'm in love with you

Please let me near you
Say that you want me
You know I'll be waiting
Just to be near you
My life is so empty
Living, living without you
Oh Lord, yеah

It's been a long road
We made it togethеr
We've left all our problems
I'll always be with you
So happy and free
So happy, it's a new day, yeah

Isn't it funny, oh
How the times they change
I'm in love with you

Come on, come on

Pack up your troubles
Forget all your problems
I've got to be near you
You've got to believe me
We build a new life

[Intro]
Uh, thank you Tokyo, 'ppreciate it
You know how it goes?
Indeed, indeed
Not my first time here
Always a pleasure to be back amongst you
Konnichiwa—that's how you say it
Ohayo gozaimasu
Welcome Tokyo Freeze, Freeze
Over Tokyo, you know?
And as we say, okay, uh, yeah

[Verse 1]
What is glory? Other side of the story
Lose your morals to be number 5 in the 40
But you're still trapped in the category
Shattered if you dapper poorly, surely your average habit forming
Havoc-wreaking attitude is half performing in this aftermath
For the bowing cast, casket closing, classic, cornerstoning is my forte
Paid for the foreplay, you might as well stay for the orgy

[?], that's gold in the panties
There goes the goals, more rose into fannings
Another chop-chop, what's the fast and furious to a chop shop?
Turn a jalop sob to a drop-top
Good as galop jamming to a Pakistani
I cop the first stone, thrown by the bone
Picky gavel handling
I love to judge misunderstandings
Throw it back at 'em like a javelin
They got me banned from the bar
When you can't stand like a man in the car
Gotta stand back, put your hand in your heart
You kicked off the force, gotta hand in your star
Like a ninja jobless
Or Kermit the Frog is
Referring to his puppeteer
Your noodles soba but you really love a beer, what a year

[Outro]
Ah, what a year, what a year, what a year

[Ron Isley]
I wash my hands, I said my grace, what more do you want from me?
Tears of a clown, guess I'm not all what is meant to be
Shades of grey will never change if I condone
Turn this page, help me change, to right my wrongs

[Verse 1]
Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday

[Verse 2]
Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

[Verse 3]
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

[Chorus]
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

[Verse 3]
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

[Outro]
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm, hmm-hmm

[Verse]
Ayo
Nail is in the coffin, Freddie sent me this shit
This sound like the boat I haven't bought yet
Lemonade, sippin' slow
Jumpin' in the water off that boat I haven't bought yet

[Intro: Pitbull]
Avicii
Mr. Worldwide

I’ve been around the world
And I can’t stop hearing this song (Felicidades Babo!)
I’ve been around the world
And I can’t stop hearing this song
And I love it

[Verse 1: Aloe Blacc]
Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start

They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

[Chorus: Aloe Blacc]
So wake me up when it's all over
Whеn I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding mysеlf
And I didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Life’s not waiting for a storm
It’s about dancing in the rain
And if it rains lemons
Learn how to make lemonade
Morale of a story
No problems, just solutions
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
We have takeoff, Houston
I’m not them boys that they used to
I got 4 million views collected on YouTube
I grew up around Jesus, coke and thick girls
And that inspired me to be a G note speaker
2 thinks guaranteed, definitely actions
They say the devil’s in the details and I won’t ask this
We got the maker
We got a dream, it’s simple
Live it, wake up

[Chorus: Aloe Blacc]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost

[Outro: Aloe Blacc]
Didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know (didn't know, didn't know)

[Verse 1]
When I'm away I think of you, When I'm asleep I dream of you too
So kiss me with your heart
Touch me with your mind
Love me like you don't care what nobody say and what nobody thinks and how nobody feel, cause when I get you alone is real

[Chorus]
And we goin make the world stand still tonight, said we goin make the stand still tonight
So cry if you need to, do what you have to as long you love me (Drown me in your tears) So cry if you need to, do what you have to as long you love me (Drown me in your tears)

[Verse 2]
Lay in your arms, i feel at ease cause nothing else matters when you're surrounding me, Baby hold me in your song and taste mе with your hands

[Post-Chorus]
Love me like you don't carе what nobody say and what nobody thinks and how nobody feel, cause when I get you alone is real

[Chorus]
And we goin make the world stand still tonight, said we goin make the stand still tonight
So cry if you need to, do what you have to as long you love me (Drown me in your tears) So cry if you need to, do what you have to as long you love me (Drown me in your tears)

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time a DJ's task
Was just to play records, what more could you ask?
But then came remixes, scratching and cuts
Which was too much for many, drove some DJ's nuts
But the DJ named Glove has reigned supreme
As the turntable wizard of the hip-hop scene
So listen to him, check him out, but remember this
When The Glove's on the wheels of steel he's Reckless

[Verse 2]
This high-powered music is truly unique
As The Glove cuts the rhythm to the hip-hop beat
Hе moves like a madman as he spins his disc
Hе's the number one scratcher on the DJ list, he's Reckless

[Verse 3]
Now I've seen DJ's, too many to name
Some gained recognition and even fame
But when you talk of MC's, Ice-T is the best
And when you talk of DJ's, forget the rest, Glove's Reckless

[Verse 4]
So listen very closely as The Glove throws down
He cuts like a razor to the big beat sound
Dave's layin' down a groove that we know you'll like
With The Glove on the turntables and Ice-T on the mic, we're Reckless

[Verse 5]
So listen to the music, let your mind feel free
Realize you're with the master G-L-O-V-E
Dave and MC Ice-T, you know you're with the best
Because when we're in the mix you know the groove is fresh
And Reckless, Reckless, Reck-Reck-Re-Reckless

[Verse 1]
I know I’m probably better off on my own
Than lovin' a man who didn’t know
What he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic
I wish it wasn’t 4am, standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, you know you had to do it
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run

[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

[Verse 2]
I know I’m probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind
At any given minute
And it was always on your terms
I waited on every careless word
Hoping it might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning
But your jealousy, oh, I can hear it now
You’re talking down to me like I'll always be around
You push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun
Oh, you never thought I’d run

[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

[Bridge]
I hold onto this pride because these days it’s all I have
And I gave to you my best and we both know you can't say that
I wish you were a better man
I wonder what we would’ve become
If you were a better man
We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You would've been the one
If you were a better man
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
(We might still be in love, if you were a better man)
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man

[Outro]
A better man
We might still be in love, if you were a better man
You would've been the one
If you were a better man

[Verse 1]
Triumph is ablaze, ricocheted
Through the age, through the age, all age, always
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
When your mind is cast iron, thread in the dark
Hold your tongue and embark
Arrowhead is sharp and will last
Digging my own grave to display
Permeate, vision of songs of love, birds of prey
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
When your mind is cast iron, thread in the dark
Hold your tongue and embark
Arrowhead is sharp and will last

[Chorus]
I'll keep your heart in a canopic jar, ah, ah
I'll keep your heart in canopic jar, oh
Pulse, sound of blood
Train through marble faces
I'll keep your heart in canopic jar
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ey, ey, ey, ey, ey, ey, ey

[Verse 2]
Triumph is ablaze, ricocheted
Through the age, through the age, all age, always
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
When your mind is cast iron, thread in the dark
Hold your tongue and embark
Arrowhead is sharp and will last

[Chorus]
I'll keep your heart in a canopic jar, ah, ah
I'll keep your heart in canopic jar, oh
Pulse, sound of blood
Train through marble faces
I'll keep your heart in canopic jar
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, I'll tell mine you're gay
And by the way

[Chorus]
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just anothеr picture to burn

[Verse 2]
There's no timе for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

[Chorus]
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

[Bridge]
And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health

[Chorus]
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard
I really really hate that
Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak, who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

[Outro]
Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn

How you blame it on me and you the main one lyin'?

[Chorus]
We only smoke fire (Fire, fire, fire, fire)
We only smoke fire (Fire, fire, fire, fire)
We only smoke fire (Fire, fire, fire, fire)
Don't give me no bammer weed
You know why? (You know why?)

[Post-Chorus]
Nigga, 'cause I'm (Snoop)

Nigga, 'cause I'm (Snoop)
I'm all of the above, I'm a freak of nature
I'm Snoopy D-O-Dub
Yeah, let's C-walk on 'em

[Verse 1]
Ain't a lot of niggas got what Snoopy got
Ain't a lot of niggas walk up in the spot
Smokin' on that lemon drop
Four or five bitches and they body hot
We should make they body rock
Snoopy on that player shit, you're not
Eenie, meeny, miney, moe
Now which Backwood I'm gon' light up
Turn it right up and get the party crackin'
So gentlemen, nothin' but all bad bitches, welcome 'em in
Smoke a little fire, let it begin (Ah)
Ready for a kush shotgun
But I'm watching niggas, don't wanna have to pop one
That's my weed, nigga (What?)
Hit 'em with the bop gun
Money talk, drop some
Don't like it? You can leave, nigga
California drippin' in my low-rider
Hit the switch, bounce, then it go higher
Def Jam, don't give a damn
Rollin' Backwoods by the gram

[Chorus]
We only smoke fire (Fire, fire, fire, fire)
We only smoke fire (Fire, fire, fire, fire)
We only smoke fire (Fire, fire, fire, fire)
Don't give me no bammer weed
You know why? (You know why?)
Tell 'em why (Why?)

[Post-Chorus]
Nigga, 'cause I'm (Snoop)

I'm Snoopy D-O-Dub
Let's C-walk on 'em
Yeah, now B-walk on 'em
Now C-walk on 'em
Now B-walk on 'em

[Verse 2]
Now, if we talkin' about fire
We talkin' about that weed to get you higher
My weed exactly that weed the buyer
Leave happy then come back, lookin' for the supplier
Where that nigga Dogg at?
VIP with the golf hat
No sticks, no seeds, and I'm off that kush
Black Impala, push up the block
Smokin' on heavyweight, bitch, and it don't stop
Don't quit, don't trip, I gotcha
Get a bar from the smooth Black Frank Sinatra
I sit back and watch ya hit the weed one time
Know you on the dance floor doin' the cha-cha
I got the fire, to the limit through the wire
King Kush, they call me sire
Smoke with the boss, I'ma get you higher
With Snoop Dogg, ain't nothin' flyer

[Outro]
We only smoke fire
Slow is the memory
I can picture her standing right in front of me
Orange blossoms crushed on concrete
I walk around with bare feet
Cause I know you want me

Can't remember everything
Her sweat, it tastes like sugar cane
And I had already gotten there before I came
My tank is empty
And I know you're thirsty

I have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to you cry
I'm sick of all these wasted years
A rag for someone else's tears
I wring you out as I hang you out to dry

And I'll see you when I get back
Maybe we can get ourselves back on the right track
You touch me there because you know how much I like that
I think that we both need to relax
Cause I know you want me
All the time and everywhere
A happy surface, but the underbelly isn't there
And the worst thing is that I don't even really care
And the emptiness is too much to bear

I have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to you cry
I'm sick of all these wasted years
A rag for someone else's tears
I wring you out as I hang you out to

C'mon c'mon
Get off the phone
Please come home
It's been so lonely since you've been gone
You won't surround me
Up and down me
Be all around me
Baby, I can't breathe no more

C'mon c'mon
Get off the phone
Please come home
It's been so lonely since you've been gone
You won't surround me
Up and down me
Be all around me
Baby, I can't breathe no more
I have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to you cry
I'm sick of all these wasted years
A rag for someone else's tears
I wring you out as I hang you out to dry

Sick of all these wasted years
A rag for someone else's tears
I wring you out as I hang you out to dry
Try, try to get back home
You try
Yeah

Lyrics from Snippet

I just sacrificed one year of my life to give you everything you wanted
But now to my surprise, you look me in my eyes, and tell me that it's just not wanted
Tears running down my eyes, I get so high, and tell myself that I'm so dumb
It's fuckin' up my life, I don't know why, I do what I know...

'Cause we will be together, forever
You and I

[Verse 2]
Won't you tell me
What you did before I found you

It's because I'm happy to be near you
So please bе patient with me

No, you won't have to worry

And it will be forever
Forever

I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heart beat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
I used to think that I was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Pre-Chorus]
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever mеt somebody like you
Used to bе afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Chorus]
(Goddamn, you got me in love again)
But goddamn, you got me in love again
(Goddamn, you got me in love again)
But goddamn, you got me in love again
(Goddamn, you got me in love again)
But goddamn, you got me in love again
(Goddamn, you got me in love again)
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Verse 2]
So many nights, my tears fell harder than rain
Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave
I'd rather die than have to live in a storm like before
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Pre-Chorus]
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Chorus]
(Goddamn, you got me in love again)
But goddamn, you got me in love again
(Goddamn, you got me in love again)
But goddamn, you got me in love again
(Goddamn, you got me in love again)
But goddamn, you got me in love again
(Goddamn, you got me in love again)
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Refrain]
I can't believe, I can't believe
I finally found someone
I'll sink my teeth in disbelief
'Cause you're the one that I want
I can't believe, I can't believe
I'm not afraid anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Chorus]
(Goddamn, you got me in love again)
But goddamn, you got me in love again
(Goddamn, you got me in love again)
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Outro]
La-la-la, la-la-la
But goddamn, you got me in love again
La-la-la, la-la-la
But goddamn, you got me in love again
And again, and again, and again, and again

[Verse 1]
Here we are in this big old empty room
Starin' each other down
Baby, I know you want me just as much as I want you
Let's stop foolin' around
Take me baby, kiss me all over
Play with my love
Bring out what's been in me for far too long
You know that's all, all baby I've been dreaming of

[Chorus]
Do me, baby
Like you never done before
Oooh, give it to me 'til I just can't take no more
Do me baby, like you never done before
I want you now, I just can't wait no more

[Verse 2]
Here we are lookin' for a reason
For you to lay me down
But a lovе like ours is never out of sеason
So baby please stop teasin' me
Ooh what you do, I could never love no other
You're the best I ever had
Whenever we're not close to one another
I just want you so bad

[Chorus]
Do me, baby
Like you never done before
Oooh, give it to me 'til I just can't take no more
Why don't you do me, baby?
Like you never done before
Oh I want you now, I just can't wait no more

[Chorus]
Ooh, do me, baby
Like you've never done before
Oooh, give it to me 'til I just, 'til I just can't take no more
Do me, baby
Oooh, like you never done before
I want you now, just can't, just can't, just can't take
Do me, baby
Do me, girl, like you've never done before
Oooh, give it to me 'til I just can't take, 'til I just can't take no more
Do me, baby
Oooh, oh
I want you now
I want you, babe
Do me, baby

[Chorus]
I wish you could read between the lines
I hoped to seek what I couldn't find
I’ve truly enjoyed all the time
We've spent on evening nights

[Verse 1]
Baby girl, I'm in the street with my niggas, goin’ crazy
When I say, "Street," I mean outside, daily
I never took a L, so I'm "L-less," like Tracee
Her blouse see through with the navy blue pasties
Obsessed with your face, but confused by your heart
These the type of feelings I'ma stop before they start
Thought I was just tryna fuck, not tryna play my cards
I can read between the lines, I'm just puttin' up a wall
And I'm stubborn like my daddy
Said she wanna talk, so I told her, "Send the addy"
Questions like, "What is this?" "What are we?" "Are you happy?"
A hundred missed calls 'cause I'm workin’ in Miami
Would ya stop with the chatter and take off the pleets, please?
I ain’t tryna make you hot, I'm tryna take you in the heat
Caribbean summers or somewhere that’s overseas
Sippin' French 75's gettin' drunk by the beach

[Chorus]
I wish you could read between the lines
I hoped to seek what I couldn’t find
I truly enjoyed all the time
We've spent on evening nights

[Verse 2]
Okay, I'm pickin' up what you puttin' down
Lil' mama fed up, but she know I put it down
Roll us up a J and baby girl take off the JJJound
Want you on the kitchen counter but a nigga eatin' out
I been workin' in the mornin' and the evening
Shawty givin' me silent treatment
I've been puttin' you through hell like a demon
But you like to keep screamin'
I'm sorry, but I know you hate lies
If you want to talk, girl, I'm parked outside
Shut the fuck up, hop up in this ride
Whenever you need me, you know I will slide
Cross my heart and hope to die
Girl, I'm not stupid, I can read between the lines
I know I'm acting young, I'm just tryna not decide
Commitment seemin' endless, I'm just really terrified

[Chorus]
I wish you could read between the lines
I hoped to seek what I couldn't find
I truly enjoyed all the time
We've spent on evening nights

[Skit: Ricky Thompson]
Look, bitch
I can pick up what you're puttin' down
I know you wanted "Me and you," but I don't want that
Let me the fuck go
Please
I'm here for a good time, not a long time
Thank you

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, yeah, uh, mm
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, uh, mm

[Chorus]
She know I'm the one like Neo
Her best friend want a trio
Ice on my neck, that’s frío
It's Friday, R.I.P Deebo
College nigga, I was drinkin' Tito’s
Now, it's champagne for the free, though
Real gold chain, not a CeeLo
Niggas wanna talk, we gon' reload

[Verse 1]
Just touched down, we in Euro
Italy summer, Lake Como
Driving on the boat next to Clooney's house
Sippin' on a lil' Casamigo' (Pellegrino)
These models say, "Cheese" for the photo
Size eleven, nigga, I'm a Frodo
I bought two chairs in the south of France
I’m a cultured motherfucker, nigga, you know
Brand new Aminé, got you baptized
Sauvie Island Records, we gon’ franchise
Seven and three quarters be my hat size
Told my barber, "Fade it on both sides"
Yeah, I told my barber, "Fade it on both sides"
Fade it on both sides

[Chorus]
She know I'm the one like Neo
Her best friend want a trio
Ice on my neck, that’s frío
It's Friday, R.I.P Deebo
College nigga, I was drinkin' Tito's
Now, it’s champagne for the free, though
Real gold chain, not a CeeLo
Niggas wanna talk, we gon' reload

[Verse 2]
I'm on my S-Q-D, M-O-B
You know where I'm from, baby (Five-O-three)
It's hard to find love when your soul feel bleak
Got a hundred missed calls, girl, it ain't that deep
Stuck in the middle
Shootin' up her club, but I don't have a pistol
Sittin' on my lap, got me hard as her nipples
That's not a Glock, baby, that's my pickle

[Chorus]
She know I'm the one like Neo
Her best friend want a trio
Ice on my neck, that's frío
It's Friday, R.I.P Deebo
College nigga, I was drinkin' Tito's
Now, it's champagne for the free, though
Real gold chain, not a CeeLo
Niggas wanna talk, we gon' reload

[Outro]
Came out the jump with it right in my truck
And we tryna have fun, fuck a PO
DMs by the mill' talkin', "Come to Brazil"
And we just might pull up to Rio

[Chorus]
If it's okay with you, then it's okay with me
If it's okay with you, then it's okay with me
If it's okay with you, then it's okay with me
If it's okay with you, then it's okay with me

[Verse]
You got real appeal in a very high dose
I know you in the field, but ain't many get close
Nope
You're Vivienne Westgood
Versace shades, lil' mama givin' me them looks
I asked the waiter, "Can we get some lemon for our water?"
My shawty parched, she want calamari for the starter
Dreads swingin' like the third cover of Tha Cartеr
She oil up my scalp and then I dick her to manaña, what an honor

[Chorus]
If it's okay with you, thеn it's okay with me
If it's okay with you, then it's okay with me
If it's okay with you, then it's okay with me
If it's okay with you, then it's okay with me

[Bridge]
I don't wanna think 'bout
All the other things that we think 'bout
When we're nervous and it's awkward
And we're closer, and we both know how
We feel, we feel, we feel
Uh-huh-huh
We feel, we feel, we feel

[Chorus]
If it's okay with you, then it's okay with me
If it's okay with you, then it's okay with me
If it's okay with you, then it's okay with me
If it's okay with you, then it's okay with me

[Outro: Rickey Thompson]
Alright, baby
If it's okay with you, it's okay with me
Tryna get real nasty wit' you
Little "Mm-uh," you know what I'm sayin'?
Me, you, dinner, anything you want, baby
Is it okay with you? Because it's okay with me
Mm, that's right

[Chorus]
Tell me where to go when the party gon' close
After party, shawty, she don't wanna go home
Don't be on no funny shit, like your elbow
Rich young nigga, fuck her on a Van Gogh

[Verse 1]
I'm in downtown, grabbin' dinner with some folks
Shawty wanna link, so I told her, "Let's go"
Her roommate sleep, so we gotta tiptoe
Twenty-somethin', baby, but you got time to grow
She know I'm the one, she know I'm a stunner
Chevrolet shawty wanna do it with no rubber
Shake my dreads like uncle E-40
Growing my hair like I'm Aminé Marley (That's a lotta hair)

[Pre-Chorus]
After the after party
Wе head to the penthousе lobby
Shawty wanna go ahead and call me
I'm from the five-zero with a three

[Chorus]
Tell me where to go when the party gon' close
After party, shawty, she don't wanna go home
Don't be on no funny shit, like your elbow
Rich young nigga, fuck her on a Van Gogh
Tell me where to go when the party gon' close
After party, shawty, she don't wanna go home
Don't be on no funny shit, like your elbow
Rich young nigga, fuck her on a Van Gogh

[Verse 2]
This ain't no "Van Gog," this a Van Gogh, stupid
Shawty double-gawk 'cause she really go stupid
Two-hand twist, oh-whoa-whoa-whoa
Like I said before, she a pro-oh-oh
I like shakes with my fries, and summer nights in your ride
And please don't stare at me high, I'm too high for your high
You know you really in my top ten
You number one, 'cause you on ten
Tattoo on your lower back
I'm Juvenile, so I make the pussy Nolia Clap
The gold chains used to stack, now they overlap
This the after party, we gon' have to go and run it back

[Outro]
Fuck her on a Van Gogh
Fuck her on a Van Gogh
Fuck her on a Van Gogh
Fuck her on a Van Gogh
Rich nigga, Van Gogh, yeah

[Interlude: Rickey Thompson]

[Chorus]
Okay I'm chillin' in Marseille
Calls from Marche
She say I'm a dog so I told her yipiyay
WhatsApp from my UK ting, she said she in the States
Hotties give me face
Keep up with the pace
The name Aminé, bitch, don't get me fucked up
The way my grills be shinin', she in love-lovе
I tell a broke boy shut the fuck up
Shе look good in that dress, I'm tryna run it up

Eat the pussy up, treat it like it's lunch
Turn around, slow it down
Eat the pussy up, treat it like it's lunch

[Chorus: Future & Young Thug]
Peepin' out the window (Yeah, yeah)
All I see is a bunch of opps tryna rise from the dead, wanna smoke me like I'm indo (Oh)
All I see is a bunch of broke-ass bitches tryna tell me I ain't poppin', I ain't hot no more
Well, listen to me closely
Bitch, I got a Rollie, it's gold like a trophy
All of my kids straight, if you truly know me
Most of my dogs bossed up

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I doubled up, I don't do no chores no more
I ain't steppin' on these niggas like no rugs no more
Find myself carin' way too much, ain't got no shrubs no more
But got way bigger shows, I ain't chargin' dubs no more
I charge a half a million dollars just to walk out
I hatе the police, but I'm big, so they brought cops out
I got a gun, shoot sixteen timеs, but it's fun sized
Sign on the dotted lines
One time for the ones saw me come from nothing
Speakin' of nothing
Pussy niggas know not to play, I ain't goin' for nothing (Yeah)

[Chorus: Future & Young Thug]
Peepin' out the window (Yeah)
All I see is a bunch of opps tryna rise from the dead, wanna smoke me like I'm indo (Oh)

Well, listen to me closely
Bitch, I got a Rollie, it's gold like a trophy
All of my kids straight, if you truly know me
Most of my dogs bossed up

[Verse 2: BSlime]
Youngin' jumped inside the game, he got some fuckin' diamonds
We make temporary decisions, change the fuckin' climate
Run with D-boys, yeah, them boys who be runnin' the lobby
Change the channel, you know I'm up next by the way I pop it
I sip on syrup a lot, but no one understand me
I told my mama, "No more sufferin', I made it"
You should've seen all these motherfuckers' faces
I told my brothers, "We ain't goin' back to basic"
Ever since I copped the Hellcat
Niggas still wonderin' why, like, "BSlime, you did that"
I'm kickin' my ones and twos, chillin' at the rib shack
Wishin' I can bring my dog back from the fuckin' jailmates

[Chorus: Future & Young Thug]
Peepin' out the window (Yeah)
All I see is a bunch of opps tryna rise from the dead, wanna smoke me like I'm indo (Oh)
All I see is a bunch of broke-ass bitches tryna tell me I ain't poppin', I ain't hot no more
Well, listen to me closely
Bitch, I got a Rollie, it's gold like a trophy
All of my kids straight, if you truly know me
Most of my dogs bossed up

[Verse 3: Future]
Peepin' out the window
All I see is a bunch of racist-ass cops tryna catch a nigga slackin' like Jim Crow
Had to make it through the worst on the turf, out the dirt, nigga stayin' down, ten toes
I done seen a lot of struggle that came with this game
She cried, but she gon' lie just to fuck on my chain
I drunk codeine and popped one just to stimulate my brain

[Chorus: Future & Young Thug]
Peepin' out the window (Yeah)
All I see is a bunch of opps tryna rise from the dead, wanna smoke me like I'm indo (Oh)
All I see is a bunch of broke-ass bitches tryna tell me I ain't poppin', I ain't hot no more

Hell yeah

All this water in these baguettes, I might turn into Nemo
Yeah

[Intro]

[Chorus: Young Thug & Doja Cat]
She say I'm high as fuck, I said, "I'm icy hot" (Icy hot)
Had a show in the 504, I wore a bunch of rocks
I got her tummy tucked before she let me fuck
I keep her in a box, she wanna spend my bucks
She said I'm fire as fuck, I said, "I'm icy hot"
I said, "I'm icy hot," I said, "I'm icy hot"
She wanna land a punch, my pocket on croissants
I call lil' mama a thot, she call me icy hot

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
First of all, I've been in the trap for a lifetime
Fuck a Dawn, I've been spinnin' black just like night-time
Above the law, I'm a motherfuckin' outlaw
Fendi scarves, Louis Vuitton on my cyclone, huh
You wanna get wet up again
You want me to get fed up again
But I don't let up again
This fool better catch up, it's time to get wet up
Now don't sweat up again
I ain't never let up again
Is you a bad bitch in a Mercedes? (Hey)
Is you a bad bitch in a Mercedes? (Hey)
They tried to burn the coupe and I'ma trade it (They tried to burn)
My niggas into swoopin', they gon' make it (They into swoopin')
They tried to kick me out, now it's disabled
I whip that Rolls-Royce like I'm a sailor (Whip that Rolls-Royce)
I count up so much, I bleed from paper
I keep the fan and glizzy by my neighbor (At all times)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Young Thug & Doja Cat]
She say I'm high as fuck, I said, "I'm icy hot" (Icy hot)
Had a show in the 504, I wore a bunch of rocks

I keep her in a box, she wanna spend my bucks
She said I'm fire as fuck, I said, "I'm icy hot"
I said, "I'm icy hot," I said, "I'm icy hot"
She wanna land a punch, my pocket on croissants
I call lil' mama a thot, she call me icy hot

[Verse 2: Doja Cat]
He give me stove top, he go hibachi-ba
He gave me boba cob, threw my Hitachi out
He lick my 'nani, ah, he call it cherry pie
He said my tiger bomb, gave him that icy hot
I run shit, I'm lieutenant, I fly you to LA
My jet look like the Jetsons, it's 2028
I feel like Abu Dhabi, I said, "Let's summer there"
He said I'm wifey type, he threw dick like bouquet
He call me Doja Rat, I chew through all his cheese
That's just the fifty carat, that's just a hundred G's
Freezer and brand new tap, no plumber for the leak
I wouldn't wish this heat on all my enemies

[Chorus: Young Thug & Doja Cat]
She say I'm high as fuck, I said, "I'm icy hot" (Icy hot)
Had a show in the 504, I wore a bunch of rocks

[Intro]
Taurus

[Verse 1]
Hopscotchin' through the street, I'm tryin' not to fall
She pray to God that I make it home before tomorrow mornin'
I'm tryna tell her to pick a Rollie, but she don't care at all
Don't care nothin' 'bout my drank, my portion's what I'm comin' for
I been keepin' up with my city
High performance on my jacket, Rolls-Royce truck for extra fifty
Just in case I run into her, I'm tryin' my best to stay spiffy, yeah

[Chorus]
See the pussies on the sideline wishin' that I fall
Pull the skeletons out the closet, I'm 'bout to tell it all
I just want my money, my hoes and all my kids to ball
I'm road raging to the millions if I have to crawl
Yeah, I'm road raging to the millions if I have to crawl, oh, yeah
I'm road raging to the millions if I have to crawl

[Verse 2]
Evеry time they call in, young nigga ballin'
I went from tеllin' them to try me to callin' shots
And I wanna know what's on your mind, what you thinkin' 'bout
And I wanna know if I can change it, let's take you out
Private flight to France, such a change the trends
I bought her a Richard, now she dance like ants in her pants
Red and white diamonds on my mans, he a ambulance
Half a million to my dad, salad dressing, bought a ranch
He said his last two weeks been busy, I'm movin' in
I told my mom look out her window to another Benz
She took nine shots of Patrón, 50 Cent
I bent the corner and seen my bros gettin' rich
Signed another check for a couple million on a jet
Swear to God, 2006, my sickest dream was buyin' a 'Vette
Bought that shit and then I wrecked and then I copped another one
Smoked forty-one, this your last batch and I got more to come
Gettin' them bales up by the metric ton, hit up feds or somethin'
Bought a Bentley with a credit card, it's the blackened one
I got shows way in Hong Kong, I'm the chosen one
You frozen tongue, you won't say it twice, I'll greet you with a gun, nigga

[Chorus]
See the pussies on the sideline wishin' that I fall
Pull the skeletons out the closet, I'm 'bout to tell it all
I just want my money, my hoes and all my kids to ball
I'm road raging to the millions if I have to crawl
Yeah, I'm road raging to the millions if I have to crawl, oh, yeah
I'm road raging to the millions if I have to crawl

[Verse]
This is what you need, need (Ayy)
I came with plenty racks
This is what you need
Wear my heart (Heart), on my sleeve (Hey)
Sit me down, baby, tell me what it is
Cross my heart, the door ajar unless it's Bentley
Say you wanna turn my back, don't go knock on my dawg door (Yeah, yeah)
I'm makin' love to shawty, oh (Yeah)
Hey sis, spendin' it up
Okay, you beat your cases and you don't have to sell the can now (Sell the can now)
And her fuckin' ring look like the Grand Slam (Woah)
Oh, I'ma have to take a Bentley jet to transit (Woah)
Eat us some lobsters, just the bros, I left the hoes out
Lost thirty million this year and that's with the shows out (Woah)
I told 'em put the rest of it up, we got to hold out
Got a few opp bitches tryna figure out where my show spot
Them racist pockets full of big faces
Get you paid quick, walk up on 'em and just face it (Bah)
Open cases, guess they thought I was somethin' to play with (Woo)
Watch me falsetto out in Vegas with your lady (Woo)
Tryna rob, your chances are slimmer than Shady (Yeah)
She got her hair long with the Maisons on, no basic (Oh yeah, yeah)
Got me thinkin' everybody 'round me cheatin' (Yeah)
These niggas basic, they need to face it
I'ma turn off the light
Lil' shawty, is you breathin'?
Tell me if you caught a fever
Strictly fuckin' up every season (Oh)
I took a Roxy and it changed me
I took her out, she know the pain, baby
You a hard-headed nigga, yeah, fuck all that though
No back and forth with the mob 'bout them nothin'-ass hoes
No back and forth with the mob 'bout your ratchet ass, yeah
I hope you plan on growin' up with your ratchet ass, yeah

[Outro]
Ah-la-la, la-la-la

[Verse 1]
Moncler coat 'cause I'm the coldest out
I had twenty thousand pints sealed in a drought
12 bend the corner, me and the dogs gettin' out
Got twenty-seven colors this Versace couch
I got it from Birdman out of his Miami spot
I told the bitch don't call me, she a Miami thot
They hate to see you rocking big ol' Pateks, rose gold
White diamonds on my wrist just like my main bitch toes
I cut the top off of the Benz, that winter was cold
I got a lot of thots, but got respect for my hoes
I got a lot of spots to recess for all my kids in the back
Playgrounds galore for teachers askin' why all of 'em brats

[Chorus]
Got big baguettes sittin' on my neck
I throwed it to my dawgs, I told 'em fetch
Fuck over opps, they can't see shit like this
I fucked her hard, I put that bitch to bed
I called 'em up and told him what he said
He text me back five days and he was dead
I told him bring my skeletons out the shed
I been sippin' on Wock', this ain't no red

[Verse 2]
Passport shawty, I can take this bitch places
High heel Chanel, oh, she rockin' big aces
A pussy nigga wish that he could trade places
I told a nigga, "You must be kidding, I'm goin' Maison"
I called my watch stupid 'cause the time froze
One-fifty for my tooth and when I find hoes
My niggas smoke Biscotti, not the pine cone
My nigga Jimbo did a dime, now he back home
I be countin' money all night long
And to my dawgs who can't fall off no more
I used to walk down, buyin' out the store
Her body was natural, now she plastic, she a Barbie

[Chorus]
Got big baguettes sittin' on my neck
I throwed it to my dawgs, I told 'em fetch
Fuck over opps, they can't see shit but this
I fucked her hard, I put that bitch to bed
I called 'em up and told him what he said
He text me back five days and he was dead
I told him bring my skeletons out the shed
I been sippin' on Wock', this ain't no red

[Outro]
Yeah (Ooh, no)
Yeah (Ooh, no)
Yeah (Ooh, no)
Yeah, yeah (Ooh, no)
Tell me (Ooh, no)
Say (Ooh, no)
Yeah, yeah

[Intro]
I wish that keepin' it real really was contagious

[Chorus]
I wish that keepin' it real really was contagious
'Cause I be showing love, always met with fake shit
But that's what's in my heart, I could never change it
I just wish that things were reciprocated

[Verse 1]
I told my lawyer, "Change the situation"
Told the judge that I was always fakin'
But I know it's in my heart and I feel it breakin'
Told him, "Let go of my boys, that would be amazing"
Try to blink out every time, I'm hidden in different spaces
Bought the same LaFerrari and told 'em keep it basic
Put up on them same lil' boys, told them, "Let's get to racing"
She don't even know what it is, now, boy, my money weighin'
Yeah, keep on dodgin' years, my young nigga waitin'
I done gave away my Porsche, I throw up
I don't pass the torch, I pour up
Syrup, when I'm forced, I ho up
Out and in, I wreck her core
I took my finger and I remade the sore

[Chorus]
I wish that keepin' it real really was contagious
'Cause I be showing love, always met with fake shit
But that's what's in my heart, I could never change it
I just wish that things were reciprocated

[Post-Chorus]
They always told me I'd be going places
Now I'm just surrounded by these different faces
But all of this applause, yeah, it came with hatred
I wish that keepin' it real really was contagious

[Verse 2]
Yeah, uh
Yesterday my daughter told me, "Daddy, you the best"
I told her, "I'm makin' it back tonight, baby, pass me that vest"
I know I'm livin' the fast life, but I sign niggas and I sign checks
I put a quarter mill' on my fingers just like Lil Baby and they all baguettes
Every week I made four thousand servin' bags for my big homie
I know I wasn't doin' it forever, but it had moved me up from lonely
Sometimes you gotta take baby steps, but now you grown and gotta want it
Everything you doin'
Wonder every ho you screwin'
I ball like Harden, Jordan
I try to keep my mouth closed, but I told 'em all the stories
I had five bitches with me lit like Robert Horry
I told my bitch from every strugglin' day we buyin' the store

[Chorus]
I wish that keepin' it real really was contagious
'Cause I be showing love, always met with fake shit
But that's what's in my heart, I could never change it
I just wish that things were reciprocated

[Post-Chorus]
They always told me I'd be going places
Now I'm just surrounded by these different faces
But all of this applause, yeah, it come with hatred
I wish that keepin' it real really was contagious

Yeah, I don't believe ya
When you say you're different
(Taurus)
'Cause I heard it all before
Yeah

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Half a million, got insurance on my watch
Half a million, now I got me some insurance on my wrist
I told lil' ma be careful, bitch, this all on my expense
I told her watch the wheels on the Bent' 'cause it ain't rented
Talk about that bitch, oh, I got plenty
I'm talkin' 'bout a lot, like a million bucks in pennies
These pussies riding waves, so why they motherfuckin' spending?
And my diamonds black like spades, and I'm smilin' and grinnin'

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
My mama told me, "Pick up the phone"
I got a call from the label sayin' it's coming in strong
I just called up my old lady, told her, "Go get what you want"
I put these racks on your potatoes, your tomatoes get gone
She ask me who I am when she see me
I'm just that nigga wit' that million dollar T.P.
I came from nothin' but that ain't how the world see me
I'm kinda happy, I guess that's how the girls skeet me
I told my nigga, "Don't be worried 'bout no CeCe"
I'ma have your shit together by your B-day
Told him just don't go out sad or be no cheapskate
I wanna see you on a building out on Peachtree
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Half a million, got insurance on my watch
Half a million, now I got me some insurance on my wrist
I told lil' ma be careful, bitch, this all on my expense
I told her watch the wheels on the Bent' 'cause it ain't rented
Talk about that bitch, oh, I got plenty
I'm talkin' 'bout a lot, like a million bucks in pennies
These pussies riding waves, so why they motherfuckin' spending?
And my diamonds black like spades, and I'm smilin' and grinnin'

[Verse 2: Gunna]
I'm puttin' a trackin' chip inside my watch
Got rich with felons, ain't no tellin', I can never be a cop
Set of Forgis on Pirelli, got me swervin', dodging pots
My investor done invested all my extras in the stocks
How I make it through the killings? How I'm here to see the vision?
Save until that money rot, I stack it to the ceiling
Give 'em everything you got, shoot a fully 'til its empty
Let 'em know, don't ever tempt me, well-respected in the city, uh
Money grown, I had to bring my Lamborghini out
Rich on my own, I brought it home and now my family proud
I got some tucked away in case we get a rainy cloud
We poured a couple eighths today, I woke up on a cloud

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Half a million, got insurance on my watch
Half a million, now I got me some insurance on my wrist
I told lil' ma be careful, bitch, this all on my expense
I told her watch the wheels on the Bent' 'cause it ain't rented
Talk about that bitch, oh, I got plenty
I'm talkin' 'bout a lot, like a million bucks in pennies
These pussies riding waves, so why they motherfuckin' spending?
And my diamonds black like spades, and I'm smilin' and grinnin'

On my second life, I ditched
All the ones and fives, I kept
All the hunduns tight, okay

You know they criticize

You don't tell no lies and I can't fuck with you only

And I always stay on track (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Young Thug]

My new house didn't come with a key, you gotta type it and see
Fuck your whole gang, we smoked the boss, we ain't smokin' no leaf
We shop online at vintage store, got thousand-dollar tees
We pass the bitch right when we done
She ain't my wife, how could I see her with my son?
Rockin' Rick Owens, got the ones that say, "Cunt"
All I do is sit and count racks up by the bunch
Took her out and paid for lunch
Rich off of Pyrex
You could twirl your arm right to left and get a Corvette
Five or six M, double R, Ferrari, I don't know where to start at
I told my teacher I'ma buy more watches 'cause I was tardy
I started screamin' out the answers before it started
Added that bitch to my ransom, then went the hardest
My homie died, I want answers, so we gon' spark it
We takin' over like cancer and goin' the hardest

[Chorus: Gunna]
Had to gamble my life, rollin' the dice
My name got a price, so talk to me nice

I put the sideline in front 'cause I can't argue 'bout shit
I told God, "Protect my life 'cause I'm gon' cum in that shit"
You know I, you know I

Bought the girl a two-story penthouse in the Big Apple like a pie
She was tryna tie me down with all her words, but they were lies
But I let her get away with it 'cause sometimes she wanna die, yeah

We got forty-five bitches just livin' it up

I ain't tryna give him a chance to kill me or take the stand on me
He know I just had a hundred thousand Ps Saran'd on me
I had to hand out all the rooms so she can't say I molested
I tried to take back all the watches, rings, and the necklaces
She said I'm takin' full advantage 'cause I'm never stressin'
'Cause I had feelings for this girl that barely owned a residence
Don't get me wrong 'cause it ain't nothing 'bout they money, nigga
I meant to tell you, since a kid, I been gettin' my own figures
I was bringin' in the racks and she was steady shopping
I'm talking big bills, all colors, nigga, Monopoly

Super different, I even stood out on my own partners
Since a kid, I been a dresser, Thousand Island

Everything a hundred, I don't ever leave a fifty, yeah
Did my own half-time, if I was simple
What the fuck you think I'm rich for?
Why you think I'm always talking shit with my hand on my dick?
In the crib, these bitches turned it to a strip show
It's what it is, though
Yeah, yeah, it's what it is, though, yeah, woah
Leave me alone, take your ass home
If it ain't another million, I ain't pickin' up the phone
Phony motherfuckers always sittin' on a throne
All I want's some pussy, baby, give a dog a bone, yeah, yeah
I don't need a lot, but I got a lot
I don't need a lot, but I got a lot, yeah
Two hundred for the whip in the parking lot

Swear I'm always shinin', couldn't tell you if it's dark or not
Just a couple things I thought about, yeah, yeah

How the fuck you ever try to play me?

I'm not waitin' for her to say she love me
I can tell she fuck with me, man, trust me
I got a ten-year-old mink still ain't fuzzy
Three-twenty-five on the dashboard
Ridin' in the Porsche, rockin' Tom Ford
I ball at Barneys, new Christian Dior
I took the jet to the New York store
She lick while I'm drivin', I'm stainin' the floor
I took it off track, now I'm ridin' in sport (Yeah)
You stay in your feelings, you never my boy
I can't come to the hood, I pull a decoy
Another body drop and they screamin' my name
I'm goin' to L.A. on a private plane
Could never come back and my family straight (Grrah)
I'm touchable? No, I'm too rich and too paid
Skeleton Cartier, black diamonds face
Pull up too deep like a fuckin' parade
Old jealous-ass niggas tryna fuck up my pay (Ha)
Blast off, Rolls-Royce Cullinan rain (Broke niggas)
I put baguettes in my wrist and my neck and my ears and my motherfuckin' chains (Chains)
This drip out the trenches, I know you gon' dig it, I come through this motherfucker plain (Woah)
I cut up my wrist, soakin' wet (Yeah) and Coachella keep callin', they won't see the face
I took her to China and changed up her climate and now she ain't talkin' the same (Woah, yeah)

Hit 'em both same time, both glad that they came (It's lit)
Keep me a vibe, but can't keep it contained
Know I keep me some dawgs, always keep 'em in training (Oh)
Tat' a logo on the back of my brain
Don't ask me what the fuck am I thinkin'
Back of these walls, I'm full of that drank
Eric came through with a little entertainment (It's lit)
Area 29, got it lookin' like space
Houston, it's a problem way we bustin' up faces and shit
I came with the snakes, no squids (Straight up)
I broke out the game with a 456
She lovin' the fest', I see it
She lovin' the fest' (Straight up, straight up)
Yeah, I see it on her face, and I'm lovin' that body
In lace, I know you lovin' Spider and Jack
Yeah, I know you got taste, if you love yourself, take shots with me
If I love you, I'll drop you a pin to a time and a place (Wait)

Texas ranch so big, that shit is perfect for the dippin'
I don't care how wet I get her, she won't catch me—
Three-twenty-five on the dashboard
Ride in the Porsche, rockin' Tom Ford
Rockin' her bed and the headboard
What, what, what, what?
Buyin' out Louis and Christian Dior
I took the jet to the New York store
Park at the regular airport
You stay in your feelings, was never my boy

[Intro Mr. Mackey]
So, first of all, smoking's bad, you shouldn't smoke
And alcohol is bad, you shouldn't drink alcohol
And for drugs, well, drugs are bad, you shouldn't do drugs
Okay, that about wraps up my introduction

Yeah, finna make the pussy whistle like the old spice man
In her whole mouth shit can disappear, sprite can
Said she need furniture, I gave her one night stand
Money on a dresser I ain't tryna be

Balling on these niggas like I'm playing

Ain't kicking no bucket, mkay
I roll up a nugget, she roll up a tub man
I roll up my sleeves, I ain't 

[?]
I'm huckle-bucking up in someone momma
Put some hummus on her stomach, then I dip

Hey I have a question for you too: "Why are you still here?"

Welcome to the hang dynasty baptist church. Crunching your episcopal baptist thirst. When you with Jesus and his people, Marting Luther King Jr. presided. Give it up for 

[?]. Give it up for pimpin' goodness gracious (Goodness gracious yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
What if it ain't about the love
And it's about the heartbreak
What if it ain't about the time
Just the risk that you take, take, take
What if it ain't about the love
And it's about the heartbreak
What if it ain't about the time
Just the risk that you take, take, take

[Verse 1]
If it ain't about the love than cut it straight yeah
I go cutthroat if you misbehave, yeah
A heart is never even when it breaks, yeah
It is situation no one gets their way, yeah
Loving one just ain't fair
All up in your rocks, I look in your face
Is this a mirage, or is this fate, is it fate, fate, fate?
Is it a mistake, stake, stake?
And I try (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I try, try to reacqueint
But shit still escalate, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
What if it ain't about the love
And it's about the heartbreak
What if it ain't about the time
Just the risk that you take, take, take
What if it ain't about the love
And it's about the heartbreak
What if it ain't about the time
Just the risk that you take, take, take

[Verse 2]
Fell in love with the old me, but she ain't even know me, shit
Maybe I wasn't supposed to hit, never would've wrote this shit
Acting like I owe you shit, maybe you supposed to switch
Maybe you're supposed to be bogus, maybe you we're supposed to bitch
And that's why my tires squeal, finna get up out of here
Give you some space and time, show you how lonely feel
Not just provoking, but you got it close enough
It's hard to come backwards from broken trust

[Chorus]
What if it ain't about the love
And it's about the heartbreak
What if it ain't about the time
Just the risk that you take, take, take
What if it ain't about the love
And it's about the heartbreak
What if it ain't about the time
Just the risk that you take, take, take

Monsters do have their place. In the zoo. In your nightmares. In the deep. In your favorite horror movies. But not in your living room, on your TV

White peoplе say I'm not white enough, weird (That's weird)
Office all white like cheers
So much water I could buy a

Money on my head, fifty two a week I'm not a year

You a super bird, keep your beak out my bizz
All she get is D, I'm her dialogist, bands

[Chorus]

[?]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, this the 'nother damn level
One man's God is another man's devil
Gentrify the hood, can't even recognize the ghetto
This used to be my favorite spot, now they got a dress code
Play with your bitch 'fore you play with my bidness
I'ma get the spirits to come pay you a visit, like hello
I'm too minimalistic, ain't nobody sleeping on you, you just need some attention, yeah
Ben Frank, I'm the asser, money can't get tumorous, just a cancer
If I ain't have a name than what would you call me
If living ain't have the price, than what would the cost be
She bisexual, like "buy me this, buy me that"
She ain't met a snapper all night like where she at
She don't fuck with her friends on the right or the left
She don't masturbate 'cause she don't even fuck with herself

[Chorus]

[?]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, in the Ghost with your boo
She give me top, Mary pop, bippi-boppity boo
That's all she wanna do, that's all she wanna do
That's all she wanna do, wanna do

Ayy, woah

[Refrain: Drake]
I'm makin' a change today
The liquor been takin' the pain away
I heard you was givin' your chain away
That's kinda like givin' your fame away
What's wrong with you?
I sit in a box where the owners do
A boss is a role that I've grown into
I love you to death but I told you the truth

[Verse 1: Drake]
I can't just be with you and only you
Yeah, I got one, Virgil got one and that there is the only two
Man, how many times have I shown improvement?
How many nights I been (Woah)
Swervin' them potholes
Not tryna fuck up the wheels on the road, okay
Funny how life goes
He thought he was sick, now he wipin' his nose, okay
Soon as you give 'em your soul
You blow up and they say you're sеlling your soul, okay
Thеy want my life exposеd
They wanna know about thе highs and lows

[Chorus: Drake]
Well, summer, all I did was rest, okay?
And New Year's, all I did was stretch, okay?
And Valentine's Day, I had sex, okay?
We'll see what's 'bout to happen next

Man, how many times have I told you the truth?
Man, how many nights I been (Woah)
Swervin' them potholes
Not tryna fuck up the wheels or fuck up the deals
I'm posted in Stockholm
It's me, the owls and the twins, it's only the real
I'm movin' way too humble
Weezy had handed it off, I still got no fumbles
I'm on the hot one hundo, numero uno
This one ain't come with a bundle
I'm in the Wynn, a million in chocolate chips
And that's just how my cookie crumble
I put a skirt on a whip and a crown on the six
But there's no need to dress up the numbers
Ayy, ayy, yeah
But I guess they must have they reasons
They wanna know how I'm livin' my day-to-day life in the regular season

[Chorus: Drake]
Well, summer, all I did was rest, okay?

I think about ways I can fuck on your friend, that's something I never confessed, okay
God got me to protect, okay
Mama I payed off the debt, okay
Baby Keem waiting the wings, you fucking him now I'm gonna be next one day
Skrrt skrrt skrrt skrrt
You wake up and floss like I'm not for gossip
If you nigga fraud, like I'm in the mosh pit
This ain't for stage fright, black out the tint, then skrrt of the lot, went turbo, ferocious, and I-
Your bitch on hypnosis, and I-
Tell your Muma that I'm sorry Baby Keem way to impulsive, and I-

Musically and lyrically, Red resembled a heart-broken person
It was all over the place
A fractured mosaic of feelings that somehow all fit together in the end
Happy, free, confused, lonely, devastated, euphoric, wild
And tortured by memories past
These are the original thirty songs that were meant for Red
I love you guys
The men who live on the farm
They live by their arm
The women who live on the farm
They reflect his charm
And they are happy
Happy 'cause they're livin' and free

Summer's gone, summer's gone
We've worked all along
Friday nights here at last
Mmm, we can feel gonna make it last
And now the children have come out of the barn
They no longer wish to live by the arm
We have climbed up thе fences
Took a look past the cloud
And wе found the whole new way
Lookin' at now

We walked along a bumpy road, oh so long
The cloudy dust before summer rains goes
Come on, and we'll let it rain
Come on, and we'll let it rain
Come on, and we'll let it rain
Come on, and we'll let it rain
Come on, and we'll let it rain
Come on, and we'll let it rain
Come on, and we'll let it rain
Goin' to the beach, goin' to the beach with my baby
Well I'll be goin' to the beach, goin' to the beach with my girl
Well I'll be stayin' out partyin' all night long
But I'll be up just as soon as it's gone
'Cause I'll be goin' to the beach, goin' to the beach with my girl

Early in the mornin' I'll be heading out the door
To where the waves are splashin' as they dance along the shore
And after havin' caught a few lyin' on the sand
We'll listen to the radio blast a rockin' band

You know I'm goin' to the beach, goin' to the bеach with my baby
Well I'll be goin' to the bеach, goin' to the beach with my girl
Where the sun is mellow and the waves are high
I'll be hanging out
It gets me high to just
Goin' to the beach, goin' to the beach with my girl

[Saxophone & guitar solos]

What other place I like to go the most 

[?]
I'm tellin' you you know I'm
Goin' to the beach, goin' to the beach with my baby
Well I'll be goin' to the beach, goin' to the beach with my girl
We might drive along the coastline
And walkin' on the sand
Strollin' in the moonlight with my baby hand in hand
Well I'll be goin' to the beach, goin' to the beach with my girl
Well I'll be goin' to the beach, goin' to the beach with my girl
Well I'll be goin' to the beach, goin' to the beach with my girl
Summer colors the fields all golden with grain
The autumn harvest inspires the thanksgiving refrain

The mountain sleeps 'neath a blanket of snow
Until uncovered by springtime rain

The mountain sleeps 'neath a blanket of snow
Until uncovered by springtime rain

[Verse: Soulja Boy]
I know-I know lil bro gone flip some

My folks have a friend who knows a little old lady
Her old electric car was just a little bit shaky
It's in a dark garage
Been sittin' there for years
She flipped on the light but it wasn't there

She called police and gave a thorough description
"If it don't turn up, I'm gonna have a conniption"
Oh the police called back, it was kinda insane
They found it on the freeway off the four right lane

I offered to take it off her hands for some money
Well, she (gibberish) take it home honey

My folks have a friend who knows a little old lady
Her old electric car was just a little bit shaky

(Fuck it I can't sing this bitch)
I'm looking out at a volcano
Trying to read the world today and see where you're at
I'll never do that
I'm a model that is uncomplicated
You can play a happy tune on me, but don't turn me off
'Cause then I am silenced
I'm standing on a beach in the distance
And even though you're far away, can you see my red light?
It's waiting to turn green
'Cause I feel so isolated without you
I can't play a happy tune on my own, so stay by my side
High on the tide
High tide, high tide, high tide, high tide
High tide, high tide, high tide, high tide, high
And it feels like I'm falling in, again
High tide, high tide, high tide, high tide
High tidе, high tide, high tide, high tide, high
Feels likе I'm falling in, again
I'm a model that is uncomplicated
You can play a happy tune on me, but don't turn me off
'Cause then I am silenced
High tide, high tide, high tide, high tide
High tide, high tide, high tide, high tide, high
And it feels like I'm falling in, again
High tide, high tide, high tide, high tide
High tide, high tide, high tide, high tide, high
Feels like I'm falling in, again

Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl, and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world? (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
And good for you, I guess that you've been working on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand-new girl
Well, good for you, you look happy and healthy
Not me, if you ever cared to ask
Good for you, you're doing great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent thе night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffectеd, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you
Well, good for you, I guess you're getting everything you want (ah)
You bought a new car and your career's really taking off (ah)
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Ha)
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you?
Well, screw that and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do
Well, good for you, you look happy and healthy
Not me, if you ever cared to ask
Good for you, you're doing great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Maybe I'm too emotional
But your apathy is like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Maybe I'm too emotional
Your apathy is like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Well, good for you, you look happy and healthy
Not me, if you ever cared to ask
Good for you, you're doing great out there without me, baby
Like a damn sociopath!
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you
Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily

[Verse 1]
Darkness growing over me silently, it's creeping closer
Depths try to take hold of me, violently they seem to hold her
Snake, I try some wizardry, patiently you seem to bolster
Hate towards my imagery, vacantly you are the sorceress

[Chorus]
You are the sorceress, you are the sorceress, you are the sorceress
You are the sorceress, you are the sorceress, you are the sorceress
You are the sorceress, the sorceress

[Verse 2]
Regain all my energy, trying to submit the holder
Momentary blasphemy, lying to your own is colder
Snake, I try some wizardry, runnin' old fools, you seem to bolster
Hate towards my infantry, tell me the truth, you are the sorceress

You are the sorceress, you are the sorceress, you are the sorceress

Sorceress
Sorceress

[Verse 1]
Ion displacement won't work in the basement
Especially when I'm not with you
Here in the heartland, a feeling so startling
I don't know what I should do

[Chorus]
Oh, Bryn, you see through the dark
Right past the fireflies that sleep in my heart
You know it's easy to see
Wait for the season to come back to me

[Verse 2]
Nights by the ocean, a westerly motion
That moves California to sea
Eyes like a seagull, no Kansas-born beetle
Could ever come close to that free

[Chorus]
Oh, Bryn, you see through the dark
Right past the fireflies that sleep in my heart
You know it's easy to see
Wait for the season to come back to me

[Verse 1]
You've been checking on my facts
And I admit I have been lax
In double-screening what I say
It wasn't funny anyway

[Chorus]
I stand
Corrected
I stand
Corrected

[Verse 2]
No one cares when you are wrong
But I've been at this far too long
To act like that when we should be
In perfect harmony

[Chorus]
I stand
Corrected
I, oh, I stand
Corrected

[Bridge]
Lord knows I haven't tried, I'll take my stand
One last time
Forget the protocol, I'll take your hand
Right in mine

[Chorus]
I stand
Corrected
I, oh, I stand
Corrected

[Verse 1]
Gonna take a little time while you're waiting in the factory line
I'll ride across the park, backseat on the 79
Wasted days, you've come to have

[Pre-Chorus]
So go, I know you would not stay
It wasn't true, but anyway
Racist dreams you've come to have

[Chorus]
Ohh, ohh

[Verse 2]
You run up the stairs, see the French kid by the door
Up one more flight, see the Buddha on the second floor
Wasted days you've come to pass

[Pre-Chorus]
So go, I know you would not stay
It wasn't true, but anyway
Racist dreams you should not have

[Chorus]
Ohh, ohh

[Bridge]
No excuse to be so callous
Dress yourself in bleeding madras
Charm your way across the Khyber Pass
Stay awakе to break the habit
Sing in praise of Jackson Crowtеr
Watch your step along the arch of

[Chorus]
Ohh, ohh

[Outro]
No excuse to be so callous
Dress yourself in bleeding madras
Charm your way across the Khyber Pass
Stay awake to break the habit
Sing in praise of Jackson Crowter
Watch your step along the arch of glass

[Verse 1]
Who gives a fuck about an Oxford comma?
I've seen those English dramas too; they’re cruel
So if there's any other way to spell the word
It's fine with me, with me

[Chorus 1]
Why would you speak to me that way?
Especially when I always said that I
Haven’t got the words for you
All your diction dripping with disdain
Through the pain, I always tell the truth

[Verse 2]
Who gives a fuck about an Oxford comma?
I climbed to Dharamsala too, I did
I met the highest Lama
His accent sounded fine to me, to me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Take your handbook, it's no trick
Take the chapstick, put it on your lips
Crack a smile, adjust my tie
Know your boyfriend, unlike other guys

[Chorus 2]
Why would you lie 'bout how much coal you have?
Why would you lie about something dumb like that?
Why would you lie 'bout anything at all?
First the window, then it's to the wall
Lil Jon, he always tells the truth

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Take your passport, it's no trick
Take the chapstick, put it on your lips
Crack a smile, adjust my tie
Know your butler, unlike other guys

[Chorus 3]
Why would you lie 'bout how much coal you have?
Why would you lie about something dumb like that?
Why would you lie 'bout anything at all?
First the window, then it’s to the wall
Why would you tape my conversations?
Show your paintings at the United Nations
Lil Jon, he always tells the truth

[Intro: JAY-Z & Beyoncé]
Yes! (Whoo, ow!)
So crazy right now
Most incredibly
It's your girl, B
It's your boy, Young

[Hook: Beyoncé & JAY-Z]
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no (Oww!)
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no (Ch-yeah!)

[Interlude: JAY-Z]
History in the making, part two!
It's so crazy right now

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave, I'm beggin' you not to go
Call your name two, three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feelin', and my pride is the one to blame (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love

[Post-Chorus: Beyoncé]
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
When I talk to my friends so quietly
("Who he think he is?") Look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

[Chorus: Beyoncé & JAY-Z]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (So crazy, your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Oh, your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now (Yeah)
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now (Hey)
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking (Ch-yeah!)
Got me looking so crazy in love (Ch-yeah!)
I'm looking so crazy, your love's got me looking (Whoo!)
Got me looking so crazy in love (I'm warmed up now, let's go)

[Verse 3: JAY-Z & Beyoncé]
Young Hov, y'all know when the flow is loco (No)
Young B and the R-O-C, uh-oh (Oh, no)
O.G. Big Homie, the one and only (No, no)
Stick bony, but the pockets is fat like Tony (No, no, no)
Soprano, the ROC handle like Van Exel
I shake phonies man you can't get next to
The genuine article, I do not sing though
I sling though, if anything, I bling yo
A star like Ringo, war like a Green Beret
You crazy? Bring your whole set (Oh)
JAY-Z in the Range, crazy and deranged
They can't figure him out, they like, "Hey, is he insane?"
Yes sir, I'm cut from a different cloth
My texture is the best fur - chinchilla
I've been iller than chain smokers (Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no)
How you think I got the name Hova? (Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no)
I been realer, the game's over
Fall back, Young (Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no)
Ever since I made the change over to platinum (Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no)
The game's been a wrap, one

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
Got me looking, so crazy, my baby
I'm not myself lately, I'm foolish, I don't do this
I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care
'Cause your love's got the best of me
And baby, you're making a fool of me
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees
'Cause baby, you got me, you got me
You got me so crazy, baby (Hey!)

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Looking crazy)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Baby, your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now (Yeah, babe)
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now (Oh)
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking (Yeah)
Got me looking so crazy in love (Woah)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love

[Verse 1: Dylan Brady, Laura Les, Both]
Hey, big man, put the money in my pocket
Nope, take your eyes out their sockets, shit!
Yeah, I know you're dead, but I heard that you talked shit
Go to your coffin, load it up, and pop it

[Chorus: Dylan Brady, Laura Les, Both]
Awwww, take us!
Yae-yae-yae, yae, yae-yae-yae, yae, aww
Yae-yae-yae, yae, yae-yae-yae, aww (Take us!)
Yae-yae-yae, yae, yae-yae-yae, yae, aww
Yae-yae-yae, yae, yae-yae-yae, aww (Awwww)

[Verse 2: Dylan Brady & Laura Les, Both]
Redneck Billie tried to fight me on a bad night
Cut his throat open, smoked an ounce out his windpipe (Wooh!)
Oh, you're sayin' I'm dumb? Buddy, shut your piehole
Potato on the gun, look like fries through your eyehole
I smoked two ounces, now I'm out of fuckin' money
Still got your mom fuckin' callin' me "Honey"
She called me up, and she says that I'm gorgeous
Oh shit, now I'm robbing your porches

[Chorus: Both]
Awwww, take us!
Yae-yae-yae, yae, yae-yae-yae, yae, aww
Yae-yae-yae, yae, yae-yae-yae, aww (Take us!)
Yae-yae-yae, yae, yae-yae-yae, yae, aww
Yae-yae-yae, yae, yae-yae-yae, aww (Awwww)
Shit!
Take us!

[Verse]
Daisy, oh, Daisy, give me your answer, do
Cause I'm half crazy over the love of you
We’ll spend our life together (together)
Regardless of the weather (the weather)
And you'll look sweet
Upon the seat
Of a bicycle built for two

[Verse]
Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer true
I'm half crazy over the love of you
It won't be a stylish marriage
I can't afford a carriage
But you'll look sweet
Upon the seat
Of a bicycle built for two
Lyrics from Snippet

La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La-la, la-la, la-la

You know I love it when you're angry
I'm looking at you like
Like
Nah-nah-nah, nah
As I make you go
I want you to go away...

[Verse 1: Jake]
Hair in the wind
You'll blow right by me
Holly Golightly
Hated your friends
It was exciting
I'll miss the fighting

[Chorus: Jake]
Kissing boys, missing work
Got hungover from your words
Same New York, it's the worst
All these nights are a blur
Going broke, make it rain
Ain't got nobody to blame
All this time down the drain
I'm the best at insane

[Verse 2: Jake]
Take off my shirt at your girlfriend's party
What's it to ya?
Nobody cares about your music
We see right through this

[Chorus: Jake]
Kissing boys, missing work
Got hungover from your words
Same New York, it's the worst
All these nights are a blur
Going broke, make it rain
Ain't got nobody to blame
All this time down the drain
I'm the best at insane

[Bridge: Jake]
I run around in circles
You can't keep up this time
I'm taken back by freckles
I'm doing every line
I'm phasing out the humdrum
I do this every time
I'm turning on today
T-t-turning on today
I run around in circles
You can't keep up this time
I'm taken back by freckles
I'm doing every line
I'm phasing out the humdrum
I do this every time
I'm turning on today
T-t-turning on today

[Chorus: Jake]
Kissing boys, missing work
Got hungover from your words
Same New York, it's the worst
All these nights are a blur
Going broke, make it rain
Ain't got nobody to blame
All this time down the drain
I'm the best at insane
Kissing boys, missing work
Got hungover from your words
Same New York, it's the worst
All these nights are a blur
Going broke, make it rain
Ain't got nobody to blame
All this time down the drain
I'm the best at insane
Kissing boys, missing work
Got hungover from your words
Same New York, it's the worst
All these nights are a blur
Going broke, make it rain
Ain't got nobody to blame
All this time down the drain
I'm the best at insane
Kissing boys, missing work
Got hungover from your words
Same New York, it's the worst
All these nights are a blur
Going broke, make it rain
Ain't got nobody to blame
All this time down the drain
I'm the best at insane
Kissing boys, missing work
Got hungover from your words
Same New York, it's the worst
All these nights are a blur
Going broke, make it rain
Ain't got nobody to blame
All this time down the drain
I'm the best at insane
Kissing boys, missing work
Got hungover from your words
Same New York, it's the worst
All these nights are a blur
Going broke, make it rain
Ain't got nobody to blame
All this time down the drain
I'm the best at insane

[Verse 1: Jake]
Give it a second, I'm no good at thinking on my feet, I-
I think I'm blacking out again
I heard the sound ringing out like it's Halley's Comet
Should probably walk it back, I need it
Sometimes I'm aimless, try my best to carry on these days with
A little bit of hope inside
The hours pass with the same old kind of comfort
They hold true, they always do

[Chorus: Jake]
Everybody's running from a halo
Everyone thinks that they're bad inside
Everyone takes what they can handle
Everyone thinks they're too young to die

[Post-Chorus: Jake & Raffaella]
(Too young to die)
(Too young to die)
(Too young to die)

[Verse 2: Jake]
Up in the air, if I get out of here, I'd kill for an hour alone
Shaky at best for the time that you spent up in the air alone
I need a moment to get outside of my head, I'm trying
God knows that that shit's never right
No further questioning, it's making perfect sense to me now
I gotta chase it on my own
So elusive like a--like a white stallion, I wanna take it for a ride
Get up, get going boy, it's your last chance to get it working
God knows that that shit's never right

[Chorus: Jake]
Everybody's running from a halo
Everyone thinks that they're bad inside
Everyone takes what they can handle
Everyone thinks they're too young to die

[Post-Chorus: Jake & Raffaella]
(Too young to die)
(Too young to die)
(Too young to die)
(Too young to die)

[Verse 1: Jake]
Sent like an SOS rising from my chest to yours
What's worse than you right now?
You got so found and lonely

[Chorus: Jake]
Eat it up, it’s a piece of cake
Pull the pin and pray it's loaded
Bless up, count your blew-its
Always knew you were afraid

[Verse 2: Jake]
So sick like a whip with the crack turned down
Breathe deep, it's centered in the meter now
Light feather-like you’re weightless for a better life, yeah
Calcutta all cut up like a shoestring, uh
Impressed, depressive when you're moody, ah
Can't rest like you're running up a mountain, yeah

[Chorus: Jake]
Eat it up, it's a piece of cake
Pull the pin and pray it's loaded
Bless up, count your blew-its
Always knew you were afraid
Bless up, count your blew-its
Always knew it was a phase

[Bridge: Jake]
Cold weather, keep it in the cabinet
If you wanna try to fuck shit up
Goddamn, it's a cold affection
Goddamn, it's a slow affection
Should probably get myself a jacket
If you wanna try to build back up
Goddamn, it’s a cold affection
Goddamn, it’s a slow affection

[Outro: Jake]
So sick, crack turned down
Breathe deep, meter now
Feather-like better like, yeah
Calcutta-uh like a shoestring, ah
Impress, impressive when you're moody, ah
Better like, better like, better like, better like

[Chorus: Jake]
If you wanna go outside for my love
Get by for my love
You could see right through me
If you wanna go and get high for my love
Make you cry for my love
Like you said you knew me
If you wanna go and waste time for my love
Pay no mind to my love
You could walk right through me
If you wanna go outside for my love
Ride or die for my love
Could you see right through me?

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
If you wanna go outside for my love
Get by for my love
You could see right through me
If you wanna go and get high for my love
Make you cry for my love
Like you said you knew me
If you wanna go and waste time for my love
Pay no mind to my love
You could walk right through me
If you wanna go outside for my love
Ridе or die for my love
Could you see right through me?

[Post-Chorus: Jake]
If you count thе seconds I lack I'll break my back just thinking about it
Add it up and then subtract, I'll leave you be if you want me to
Spent my money but I'll make it back
Like cold hard cash, like blood on the pavement
Add it up and then subtract, I'll leave you be if you want me to

[Bridge: Jake, Jake & Nathan]
I think you could, you wouldn't maybe
I think you could, if you tried to like me
I think you could, you wouldn't maybe (I think that I'm not thinking about you, everyone else is leaving without you)
I think you could, if you tried to like me (I think that I'm not thinking about you, everyone else is leaving without you)
I think you could, you wouldn't maybe (I think that I'm not thinking about you, everyone else is leaving without you)
I think you could, if you tried to like me

[Chorus: Jake]
If you wanna go outside for my love
Get by for my love
You could see right through me
If you wanna go and get high for my love
Make you cry for my love
Like you said you knew me
If you wanna go and waste time for my love
Pay no mind to my love
You could walk right through me
If you wanna go outside for my love
Ride or die for my love
Could you see right through me?

[Post-Chorus: Jake]
If you count the seconds I lack I'll break my back just thinking about it
Add it up and then subtract, I'll leave you be if you want me to
Spent my money but I'll make it back
Like cold hard cash, like blood on the pavement
Add it up and then subtract, I'll leave you be if you want me to

[Verse 1: Jake]
Catch me leaving in the dead of night
Run, run like an animal holding back the tears so
I get by like a week at a time
But it seems so pitiful, seems like I'm awfully
Scared of the things that I am sometimes
Hide away, you can stay if you feel like you want to
Like the fool with the deck stacked up
Maybe I should say some things that I ought to, now

[Chorus: Jake]
Oh no
No, oh no

[Verse 2: Jake]
Scorpio, we might be the same
You're so good at laughing off things that affect you
Wish I could tap your confidence
Think it's kinda hot how you downplay all
That shit that you got when you gave me your heart
Instead of looking outside, you were looking inside
Can't put away what you left in my bed
While I was looking upwards, you were looking ahead

[Chorus: Jake]
Late nights with the TV on, sandman been away too long
Stay up till the break of dawn, necessary, necessary evil
With the TV on, sandman been away too long
Stay up till the break of dawn, necessary, necessary evil

[Post-Chorus: Jake]
Oh no
No, oh no

[Bridge: Jake]
Stirring the pot with our fate in my hands
It feels so incredible
Wait for the time when it comes back around
It cures like an antidote
That you got when I messed with your heart
Instead of looking outside, you were looking inside
Can't put away what you left in my bed
While I was looking upwards, you were looking back then

[Chorus]
Late nights with the TV on, sandman been away too long
Stay up till the break of dawn, necessary, necessary evil
With the TV on, sandman been away too long
Stay up till the break of dawn, necessary, necessary evil

[Outro]
Necessary, necessary evil
Till the break of dawn
Till the break of dawn
Till the break of dawn

[Verse 1: Jake]
Driving like a bride in a newly married kind of way
With the top down and I'm breathing in the sunshine
Breathing like it's too bright, but I'm alright
We can go whichever way
Talk about our long days, take the long way
You can shoot whatever babe
If you get the last say, I'll be okay

[Chorus: Jake]
I don't care what we are, it just has to work
Where we end is something far
Something hard to understand

[Verse 2: Jake]
Where's the worry in the wrong thing?
Gotta find the right scene and I'm getting clean
Running out of energy playing for thе wrong team
Like a bad dream
Whеn'd we get so far away from what we wanted, babe?
Why'd we run away?
Going on like there's nothing's wrong, tryna find the better days
'Til they fade away

[Chorus: Jake]
I don't care what we are, it just has to work
Where we end is somewhere far
Something hard to understand

[Bridge: Jake]
You're onto me, Ada, Ada
We disagree, made up, made up
I'll try to get free, gave up, gave up
Just let me be, Ada, Ada

[Chorus: Jake]
I don't care what we are, it just has to work
Where we end is somewhere far
Something hard to understand
And we both been on better terms, lesson learned, I'm trying
Where we end is somewhere far
Something hard to understand
I don't care what we are, it just has to work
Where we end is somewhere far
Something hard to understand
I don't care what we are, it just has to work
Where we end is somewhere far
Something hard to understand
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse 1]
...
Ain't nobody else gotta know, just us, baby, just us
Said there's some shit to address, I think it's best we don't speak
Tell me without telling me, tell me you know what I mean
...

[Intro]
Yo, peace, peace
Morning work, well, early afternoon
Peace and blessings to Mama Electronica

[Verse]
Tyler hit me like, "Wow"
This next is gon' feel like going to trial
With Simone Biles all in your files
You got a hundred dollars, your lawyer's a hundred thou
What we doing now, ayy, you ain't gotta suit
You wake up every morning hoping you ain't gotta shoot
I stay off in the silliest of coupes
Since the two-way in my face, I kept Chilly in my loop
It means I see the diamonds through the mess
Royal battler from the island of the left
The Dalai Lama might chimе in from Tibet
To quiet violencе in the mind, try silencing the neck
Kemetic science and some chess
Masters or a rasta use an IBIS for a jet
But truly forest all in the sinus of the blessed
Still pilot a mech with Detritus on the specs
Oh, lord, with the aesthetics of a lodestar
Came through the ghetto with some bread and a go board
You can still see the sparkles if it's viewed right
I just choose to do it to Warby Parker's at a food fight (Hm)
I cry to violins
Only engage with the ops to tryna find a higher lens, yeah

[Instrumental fade]

[Verse 1]
You roll like thunder
When you come crashin' in
Town ain't been the same
Since you left with all your friends
You roll like thunder
When you come crashing in
Regattas in the wind
That's why you're visiting

[Pre-Chorus]
You act like fucking Mr. Brightside when you're with all your friends
But I know what you're like
When the party ends

[Chorus]
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait

[Verse 2]
You roll like thunder
Pourin' all your drinks
The party's lit and you, my friend, half-cut when it begins
You roll like thunder
You're tryna catch that wind
That lightning in the bottle
That moonbeam in your hand

[Pre-Chorus]
And you try to see the bright side when each nеw day begins
But you're not satisfied
At thе rainbow's end

[Chorus]
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait
I don't wanna wait
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait

[Bridge]
'Cause if you're on fire, you're on fire (Just do it)
Just keep burnin' 'til rain (Just do it, don't wait)
Baby, keep me ablaze
Honey, if you're on fire, you're on fire (Just do it)
Just keep burning, keep me alive (Just do it, don't wait)
Spare your blade

[Chorus]
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait
If hello just means goodbye then honey, better walk away
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait
If hello just means goodbye then baby, better walk away
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait
'Cause I don't wanna wait
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait

[Outro]
(Just do it)
(Just do it, don't wait)
If you're on fire, you're on fire
You should just keep burning
(Just do it)
(Just do it, don't wait)
(Just do it)
(Just do it, don't wait)
(Sheila)
(Sheila)

Sheila is yesterday's kiss
The girl who loved me, the heart that I miss
At times when old flames reappear
I cry over souvenirs or smile at lonely flowers

Those hours with Sheila, I'll never regain
Their light has faded like one summer rain
But someway I'll find that someday
When Sheila is mine once again

(Those hours with Sheila, he'll never regain)
(Thеir light was faded like one summеr rain)
But someway, I'll find that someday
When Sheila is mine once again

(Sheila, Sheila)

[Unknown Woman]
It's not- It's not onto me because whatever, I-
Of course, I'm gonna feel the way that I feel
But I-

[Chorus]
It's getting kinda late now (Uh)
I should probably go home (Yeah)
I got way too lit last night
Still ended up on my own (Yeah)
I was with KD last night
That's why I ain't pick up your call (Yeah)
You said that you need some time (Yeah, uh)
You said you need time alone

[Verse]
Uh, drunk texting my ex (Yeah)
Tell her you're the best for real (Yeah)
Wake up in the nest (Damn)
Like why the fuck I text her that?

[Open Verse]

[Chorus]
It's getting kinda late now (Uh)
I should probably go home (Yeah)
I got way too lit last night
Still endеd up on my own (Yeah)
I was with KD last night
That's why I ain't pick up your call (Yeah)
You said that you need some timе (Yeah, uh)
You said you need time alone
Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro]
Fuck, don't want love
Won't fuck, don't want love
Yeah
Oh Lord, Jetson made another one

[Verse]
She won't fuck, don't want love
She won't fix and pour me up
But I know 

[?], fifteen and in this club
40k on my own, we used to jugg
Trap out at 

[?], now we on this 

[?]
Told my lil' cousin, he still in that situation, he locked up
He twelve years old, fightin' cases, got a lot on his plate
And I feel like that it's my fault, that I was so impatient
Only if I had waited, maybe then, I would've changed it
Yeah this the type of shit that run up on my mind on the daily
Oh, this Designer, imported from China, kinda hard to find
Bitch you a liar, hoes know you don't love me
You gonna love thеse diamonds
Yeah this that type of shit that makе them want to roll up on top
Said he was sorry 'cause he know G-Money would've pulled that .9
Yeah and I don't know how to feel, know how to feel if I'm honest
If you give me that real, I'll give you the real, if I'm honest
Yeah I don't know how to feel, know how to feel if I'm honest
And tell me just how you feel, just how you feel, I want it (Okay)
Body changed, switched my lane
Nowadays I just switch my plane
Money longer don't mean a thing
No 'mount of money can't make this change
Changin' up, always knew they would
Buy new clothes just to kill all my pain
All my 

[?] told me I would
Comin' back I'm gonna spend everything
As long as I got dead presidents then I'm good
R.I.P to my dead friends, left in the woods
I know they lookin down on me, doin' shit like I should
Yeah, I came a long way from them tellin' me I could
As long as I got dead presidents then I'm good

A million ways, I only need one
A million moments, I only need one
No fear on my body, no, I don't feel none
(No fear on my body, no, I don't feel none)

[Verse]
Yeah, yeah

Do what it takes to survive
A million rеasons, but there's only one reason why
I waited most of my life
I know that you only get one shot, I'm making it mine
Hustled hard, paid the price
A million reasons I'ma shine
I took the chances, made it right
I never sleep, I gotta grind

[Chorus]
A million ways, I only need one
A million moments, I only need one
No fear on my body, no, I don't feel none

[Verse 1]
Look, I was with Kobe last January 1st
Trapped inside a year that just can't get no worse
Present traumatic stress got me damaged and hurt
I've been in the gym tryna lift off a curse
That's been on me since my family tree was planted on earth
Swear my seeds gonna have a new advantage at birth
I stopped hoping for the best now I'm demanding it work
I handle my dirt if good karma don't land on it first
Relentless how I give it all but never give in
Just like NBA players in my girl's DMs
Steady shooting shots that'll never go in
Fuck it I'm focused on making money we nеver gon' spend
My whole lifе is like my blessings queued, right on schedule
I still hate seafood but love the oyster perpetual
Ayy never cheat yourself, that might be God testing you
Rocky roads I pedal through, when niggas switch I never do
Even when lights behind me was red and blue
Million times my revenue soul is unsellable still
My mind get conflicted as a Palestine border
My grass greener I spray it down with alkaline water
Big fucking checkbook and yeah I'm the author
Not just from learning but applying what life taught you
That's why I'm done confusing people's opinions with facts
And getting sidetracked by people who life not on track
Done did a song with every artist I respected in rap
Bitch and they ain't charge me shit cuz they respected me back
So give me that first, hit like black church, Tyson bag work
I deserve Nipsey last verse recorded by Hit
Ain't nothing in the world more important than this
Half a ticket on me like I already boarded some shit
But they been exploiting us ever since we got off the ship
Trust issues with the world man that I gotta clear within
But how I'm supposed to after the Tuskegee experiment
Where they took four hundred blacks, snuffed 'em syphilis
Knowing that they might die never see or hear again
Land of the free where nothing's free
And you ain't really free until you free within
But they don't teach you that they rather keep that for them
Let me chill before the Secret Service pull back up here to speak with him
Man I'm in too deep with them again
It already happened once
But tryin' to school y'all on some shit that they don't teach in them
You know we're saying too much
But I can't get up here and say too little either

[Verse 2]
BIG, all my deals match me
White collar business without the scam bleach
I got ten LLC's, pay tax, dues and fees
Every dollar an employee, my money working for me
My auntie passed while I was performing overseas
That's the price I pay on top of paying for everything
But when you the backbone of your family
They only stand as tall as you standing
Even when your feelings and your actions ain't matching
And you carry everyone baggage
You just haven't found the right time to unpack it
And the schedule steady packed in
And you front line for the back end
And all the walls that you built up are the ones you get trapped in
And somehow you fall right back into your worst habits
Man, too much pain soaked up, I have to spill
No wonder I'm doing songs with Nas, I got mass appeal
A problem solver cuz money and problems a package deal
I break the bank over and over, give it no time to heal
Just like they did my heart
I got my family out the dark and out of debt
From laying my life on the line and taking risk
Probably why I relate so fucking hard to that Squid Game shit
Except I would have got on the plane at the end
'Cause I know that family comes first, especially over revenge
You only get this type of reach when you overextend
A lot of y'all overpretend
I ain't going out for advice, I'm going within
Everybody want the credits but I take the cash
'Cause we all know that credits is the shit that roll at the end
And we ain't nowhere near it
No matter how far away from home I go
I know they always cheering
And when I quiet the noise around me I can always hear it
What has the game done to you, Sean?
A lot of songs I wrote for icons
That I still ain't even get publishing on
And some of them up more than me
I don't know how they sleep at night knowing they wrong
No happy endings where I'm from and that shit rub me wrong
Sean you been in love too long it sound like all your hunger gone
I'm fucking starving
I saw a sunset on the way here so colorful and vivid
It reminded me that God my favorite artist
And the fact I woke up today and saw it
Reminded me that I'm winning regardless
For real
Regardless

[Verse 3]
My life get chaotic as Dennis Rodman's
Stars intertwine my soul back to alignment
If we don't have the same vision, no point in exchanging contacts
Only ex I love running into is at the end of my contracts, yeah
Bottom line, I'm seeing through your mask and its fake
Like we're at the Comic Con, I point 'em out from time to time
Yeah, speaking of time, me and my aunt been gettin' closer
Either I took her for granted or didn't know her
Or is it I'm getting older?
Or is it Luke is finally turning into Yoda?
New beginnings, no such thing as overs
We should have just stayed friends
That never opened up and needed closure
God, give me directions like Noah
Fuck all that hopeless romantic shit
But it was cool to see Ye get back with Hova
Lil bitch, this the new chain of command
Might bring the pow chains back like me and Ye in Japan
Cudi back at it, I'm saying
Everything I know now could've been added to then
Nothing better than having it all
Except having it all losing it all then getting it back again
No writing on the wall but still I know how to read a room
I don't need a casket when I die I need a tomb
My focus back active now I'm getting consumed
Yeah I'm awake with the moon
Mother Nature, so when I die and I'm buried
What that mean, I'm goin' back in the womb?
Planned parenthood couldn't planned it
Donda had signed my advance checks
Stuck in the rooms, I ain't panic
You only good as your plan is
I can't debate the semantics
You gotta live with my antics
My life is ruled by the planets
God message still is in transit
So I'm expanding my bandwidth
Gone

[Verse 4]
Look
Dirty or corporate I get a check in assortments
You better clean up your energy 'fore you come around
'Cause I pick up on shit and absorb it
I did not come to your house to come look around
I came in that motherfucker to torch it
I used to show love and peace
To people who ain't give a piece of love
Now I'm right back on that warship, making somebody important
But you not important to them is like motherfuckin' torture
Some niggas bitch made, it's in their chromosomes
DNA, blood in their veins that's coursing
If you a real one, gotta stand tall
'Cause right now it's a shortage
Niggas be wanting their flowers
I'd rather go get my hands dirty and go pick my own, shit
Lil bitch, only linkin' with the chain gang
'Cause I know if the Ms was Os, they'll still do the same thing
Lot of y'all living in the past 'cause you can't do this shit again
Me, I know yesterday's scores are not the one to win today's games
Black card, black mask, black pride
My whole life is monochromatic
I don't be wearing no skirts and dresses
But if it's an issue, I drag it, hey
G-lock on me and that motherfucker came with attachments
Just like my last bitch, nowadays niggas is more into reading the caption
Than into reading the passage
Hold up, the fuck is that?
Hit it then I splat
Ayy that's how I step on niggas
Your favorite rapper my motherfucking doormat, look
I go at their necks and hearts
That shit you was building forever, I tear it apart
Me, I'm a stepper for real, since from the beginning
I mean I was born in March
Shoutout to Nardo but fuck it, a OG
I'll probably slide to the Bee Gees
I mean I got a old soul for real
My past like probably go back to the BCs
Been going platinum since my first was my last
And I was there dancing with CB
You got your first plaque from streams
I got mine from selling a CD
Hometown hero for real
They might as well put me on Marvel or DC
You gotta look up to reach me, look
And it's one, two, three, four million at the label though
Five, six, seven ways besides rap I'm getting paid
We started broke, didn't break
First in my gen, I had to generate
Verses like I'm Johnny Cage
I'm the boss, meet me on the final stage
Lil bitch, hey
The fuck is that?
Fuck is that? hey
Nigga that's IRS, hey
The biggest gang is the government nigga
I was hype 'fore we got the new president
Then I realized, really what has he ever did?
Niggas still dying and crying in reverends
Bullets still flying and churches still candlelit
Type of life make you get fucked by the candidate
It's lot of questions that still need some answering
I had to cut off the ones that was cancerous
Swear the flow came with batons how they ran with it

[Verse 1]
You who dwell in the shelter of the Lord
Who abide in His shadow for life
Say to the Lord, "My refuge
My rock, in whom I trust!"

[Chorus]
And He will raise you up on eagle's wings
Bear you on the breath of dawn
Make you to shine like the sun
And hold you in the palm of His hand

[Verse 2]
The snare of the fowler will never capture you
And famine will bring you no fear
Under His wings, your refuge
His faithfulness, your shield

[Chorus]
And He will raise you up on eagle's wings
Bear you on the brеath of dawn
Make you to shine like thе sun
And hold you in the palm of His hand

[Verse 3]
You need not fear the terror of the night
Nor the arrow that flies by day
Though thousands fall about you
Near you it shall not come

[Chorus]
And He will raise you up on eagle's wings
Bear you on the breath of dawn
Make you to shine like the sun
And hold you in the palm of His hand

[Verse 4]
For to His angels He's given a command
To guard you in all of your ways
Upon their hands they will bear you up
Lest you dash your foot against a stone

[Chorus]
And He will raise you up on eagle's wings
Bear you on the breath of dawn
Make you to shine like the sun
And hold you in the palm of His hand

[Coda]
And hold you, hold you in the palm of His hand

[Intro]
Mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Mm-mm-mm)
Look (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Sittin' on the bus reevaluating, we go
Nowhere to stay, I'm at a realization, but I'm still
Livin' future, I got to be patient
No one ever had success overnight and was famous
And I've been thinkin' about life, how to get to this
I write these songs 'cause I've got issues with trust and shit
I've got to change the situation, I know, I know
No guarantee but there's no options, no more, no more

[Chorus]
And now I'm stuck
Right back here (Mm-mm-mm)
And now I'm stuck (Stuck, stuck, yeah)
Right back here (Stuck stuck yeah)

[Verse 2]
Tough times to rough routes, let's gather money at lunch time
Livin' out of my bag and couch, I feel my 

[?]
Shit starting to part, but I'm startin' to make a name
And the story is getting realer, hope I don't crack in the makin'
Fuck, I never got this deep, never wanted to speak
All my issues like this, but I cannot just keep
These feelins' inside, I'm livin' this life
I'm in two opposite worlds
And its killin' inside because there's nobody to talk to
All of these friends, I can't explain this feeling, but it do not end
And how did shit go good to being so bad?
And it's like shit was good, but now it all hurts

[Chorus]
And now I'm stuck
Right back here (Mm-mm-mm)
And now I'm stuck (Stuck, stuck, yeah)
Right back here (Stuck stuck, yeah)
(Stuck, stuck yeah)
Mm-mm-mm (Stuck, stuck, stuck, yeah)
Mm-mm-mm (Stuck, stuck yeah)
Mm-mm-mm (Stuck, stuck, stuck, yeah)

[Chorus]
What I need is somebody
What I need is your lovin'
And I see your lonely
So baby come closer
Don't let me go (Oh)
What I need is somebody
What I need is your lovin'
And I see your lonely
So baby come closer
Don't let me go (Oh)

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
What I need is somebody
What I need is your lovin'
And I see your lonely
So baby come closer
Don't let me go (Oh)
What I need is somebody
What I need is your lovin'
And I see your lonely
So baby come closer
Don't let me go (Oh)

[Intro]
Perfect!

[Chorus]
Roll my problems in a blunt
Smoke it 'til I'm numb
And I got a new bitch and I swear that she the one
But she probably not the one
I say that about everyone
Man fuck these hoes, I want this money
I put that over everyone
Oh me, oh my
I can't even lie
Sometimes I be wondering why the fuck I even try
Oh me, oh my
I can't even lie
Sometimes I be wondering why thе fuck I even mind

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
And I know shit ain't the same no more
You only hit me when you faded
And I know that you been waiting
On me, but I don't got no patience
Is you with it now? 'Cause I don't got time to wait, patient
You tell me how you want it now, but you don't got patience
You tell me how
'Cause you know shit ain't the same no more
You only hit me when you faded

[Verse 1: Kaash Paige]
Went from playin' games
Babe quit playin' with me
Went from fuckin' with lames
Because they only want fame from me
You'll never get the picture, only want the frame, I see (See)
Thought our love was cutthroat
But we stopped, it got too deep, yeah
So don't treat me like a patient
I'm patiently waiting for amazing conversations
What if I kissed you right now?
What if I called you right now? (Ooh)
Would you let me? Would you pick up?

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI, with Kaash Paige]
And I know shit ain't the same no more
You only hit me when you faded
And I know that you been waiting
On me, but I don't got no patience
Is you with it now? 'Cause I don't got  the time to wait, patience
You tell me how you want it now, but you don't got patience
You tell me how
'Cause you know shit ain't the same no more
You only hit me when you faded

[Verse 2: Kaash Paige]
Every time you say it, we relationship goals (Oh)
This relation shit old (Oh-oh)
All this fakin' shit old (Oh-oh)
Are you ready?
'Cause I'm usually fuckin' with hoes
And you know I do the most, ladies get it and go
This been on my mind since January 1st
So used to bein' with you, when I'm alone, it fuckin' hurts
I used to be a player, flirt and I'm a jerk
It's crazy, we so young and get sore eyes when we get hurt

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI, with Kaash Paige]
And I know shit ain't the same no more
You only hit me when you faded
And I know that you been waiting
On me, but I don't got no patience
Is you with it now? 'Cause I don't got  the time to wait, patience
You tell me how you want it now, but you don't got patience
You tell me how
'Cause you know shit ain't the same no more
You only hit me when you faded

DJ on the beat so it's a banger

[Chorus]

Uh shawty I love you but I don't want to
I got too much on my mind to worry bout'
She ask me why I get high and don't leave the house

Fuck all of the bullshit
Walkin' to the meeting smelling like a pound on me
Told that bitch that I just want the head now you can't hold me
Went and got some new money

You must be crazy
Get the fuck up off my line but we is not friends

Bitch you are crazy why the fuck you talkin' to me like I'm not them
Walk into Prada and spend fifty at one time because I got m's

[Outro]
DJ on the beat so it's a banger

[Verse 1]
There's a pine on fire
And your eyes get wide, excited by the violence it inspires
There's a spark on the wire
Oh Joanna I'm stuck, oh Joanna I'm tired

[Chorus]
And you say, "Oh man, well you can't out-run it
And it can't be undone
Shadows jumpin' like puppets and laughin' at you"

[Verse 2]
There were times I lied
But there were times where you were clapping and laughing
There were honest times too
There were times you cried
So I said "Extend your giving hand, Joanna
And I'll cry with you"

[Chorus]
But I know, I know that I cannot change it
And it can't be undone
Shadows stretchin' and scratchin' at your heels where you run
But I know, I know that I cannot change it
And it can't be undone
Shadows stretchin' and scratchin' at your heels where you run

[Live in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia: R. Kelly & Backing Vocalists]
Uh
Let's settle down for a second so I can talk to y'all for a second
I got a problem
The day before I got on the plane to come out here
Me and my girl broke up
Yeah, we broke up
And it was over something really really silly
Something we shouldn't have broken up over
But it is, it is what it is
We broke up, and here I am in Ethiopia tonight
Question:
Is there anybody out there single?
That broke up with they man and they looking for somebody else right now?
You gotta be single
You gotta be single
Single ladies put your hands in the air right now so I can see you
It's so many, I'm confused
Single ladies, single ladies
Now I would like to get to know you and
Talk to you and have a drink or something and we can just have something to eat and just
But at the end of the conversation
At the end of the conversation I'm gonna want you to come back to America with me
I know I am
So you gotta be willing to split the difference
Come to America and see me, I come out here to see you in Ethiopia
But it's so hard to get back and forth
So hard to get back and forth, that's the problem:
How am I gonna get you from Ethiopia to America?
Let me think, let me think
I got it:
Do you have your passport? Did you get your shots?
Girl, would you like to come back with Rob to America? America?
Do you have your passport? Did you get your shots?
Girl, would you like to come back with Rob to America? America? America, the beautiful?
To America, America, America, America
Do you have your passport? Did you get your shots?
Who wants to come back with I to America?
To America, America, America, America
To America
America, America, America, America
America, oh, to America
Life is like an element
Everyone hoping and praying for settlement
Living here with self defense .....
Cause you don’t know what is coming next
We just wanna merriment
But they wishing me hell in atonement
Mama didn’t told me this
But I just live like I was here in the early days

Life is like a race
Focus on your chase
Never trust a bi**t
She gon stitch for the rich

Everyone is blessed
I know everyone is blessed
Because  everyone is  graced
It’s a matter of stress
Everything gon be alright at the end

What
What you saying bro

They know am the best
I’ve been smoking puzzling
Like it’s kiss and caress
Oh am screaming yeah...


For I just reminisce
And I beat up the case
My Life is amaze

I just pick up the doo
Ama go get the smoke
Let me blow
Am Mixing the juice
With 4 different drugs
The research is good

They loving my mood
They copy and do
They try to be two
I try to be good
I cannot be rude
I came from the zoo

No capping on this
I murder my fears
I murdered the tears
I shutdown the case
I speak in the face
I’m making it straight
I Just Illustration
Everything is clear
I go by myself
The bigger the bag
The bigger the bills
Is the harder you chase

Two bi***s  on me
I play with the legs
I pray with the tits
She play with my d**k
I took off her dress
She took off my jean

You know what is next
On top of the bi**t
The pussy is  wet
She’s ready for s*x
I cheat on my ex
I cheat with your bi**t
I pay for the stress

My life is amaze
I need me no stress
I don’t settle less
Ama beat up my cheat
What I do is the best

My problem don’t fight
My ego don’t lie , I reach to the sky
The way that she slide , the way that she ride
Is a bumper tonight....
The plug is alive , the Connect is high
The future is bright
Am bombing the site, am making it right
My face wearing smile

I don’t pay my tithe
But am living right , the blessings don’t slide
I thanks God for life
I look to the sky I see the moonlight

[Verse 1]
Well I can't lie, I couldn't wait
But it's half-past eight and you're late again
Well, I got those high heels on, and lace
And I spent two or three hours beatin' my face

[Pre-Chorus]
So why? Could you explain?
Well I can't lie, I'm fed up
I don't like being stood up
And hey, hey
What are you ashamed of?

[Chorus]
So what are you so afraid of?
'Cause you're missing out
On good, good lovin'
You're missing out, you're missing out
You're missing out, you're missing out on

So what are you so afraid of?
'Cause you're missing out
On good, good lovin'
You're missing out, you're missing out
You're missing out

[Verse 2]
You ride those rank bulls and get first place
Eight seconds is all it takes
You got those silver spurs on
And chaps 'round your waist
Callousеd hands, and dirt on your face

[Pre-Chorus]
So why? Could you explain?
'Cause I can't liе I'm fed up
Why you always standin' me up?
And hey, hey
I still wear the t-shirt that you gave me

[Chorus]
So what are you so ashamed of?
Rodeo could kill ya
I just wanna kiss ya
But you won't let me near ya
But I'm here all the same
You're missing out on good, good lovin'

So what are you so afraid of?
Tell me, what are you so afraid of?
'Cause you're missing out on
Some good, good lovin'
You're missing out, you're missing out
Good, good lovin'

[Outro]
At the rodeo, I
Put my face on and smile
And you ride good
Crowd go wild, claps for you
I clap too, I'm your biggest fan
Clap for you
I'm your biggest fan

At the rodeo, I
Put my face on and smile
And I get scared watchin' you
And the crowd gets wild, run to you
I run to you, I run to you, I run to you
I love you, I love you, I

[Verse 1: Noah Le Gros]
All the patron saints of Texas
All the green men from Mars
All the neon lights in the world
And all the smoke from honky-tonk bars

[Chorus: Dijon & Mk.gee]
Turn your hair down
I might head out
Drunk in my car
When I get home
I'll let you know
And when you get home
Please let me know
If you love me
Please let me know
I'll come back around

[Verse 2: Noah Le Gros]
Rodeo lights
Ooh
Friday football games
Are you laughin'?
Are you watchin'?
Do you even know my name?

[Chorus: Dijon & Mk.gee]
Turn your head 'round
And see me
Under lights all blue
Like your TV screen
If you still love me
Will you lеt me know?
If you love me
Plеase let me know
Ah, if you still love me
Please let me know
And I'll come back around

[Outro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ohh (Ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh
Turn the radio down, haha
New styles! It don't matter what it's on
I can hit a new style every time, bitch

[Verse 1]
Do you still take a long time to get ready?
'Cause you used to make too much out of that kind of stuff
When you turn your head around and it kills
'Cause the dress looks nice on you still
And it always will
I wait a long time just to see you
I'm happy to be catchin' up
No, we don't have to patch things up
Just turn the lights down for the thrill
'Cause the dress looks nice on you still
And it always will, so

[Chorus]
We should go out and dance like we used to dance
We should go out and hold hands like lovers hold hands
And I can't tell you who's gonna last
Well maybe that's the question, an answer I don't have
(I can't tell)

[Verse 2]
Okay, I took a long time to get ready too
'Cause I didn't remember it
And my head got heavy like it tends to do
And I know that ain't part of the deal
But the dress looks nice on you still
And it always will
I hated myself for some time
For the things that I said
The things that I put in your head
And I tried and I tried, but I failed
But the dress looks nice on you still
And it always will, so

[Chorus]
We should go out and dance like we used to dance
We should go out and hold hands like lovers hold hands
And I can't tell you who's gonna last
Well maybe that's the question, an answer I don't have
Well maybe that's the question, an answer I don't have
We should go out and dance like we used to dance
We should go out and hold hands like lovers hold hands
And I can't tell you who's gonna last
Well maybe that's the question, an answer I don't have
Well maybe that's the question, an answer I don't have

[Outro]
(We should go out
Said we should go out)

[Verse 1]
Jimmy asks a lot of questions
Some are heavy some are less than
And he can holler like a preacher when he's mad
But there's a good one underneath our bed
And I do not mind
Having him around sometimes

[Verse 2]
And Helen is a good dancer
She can move just like she's hexed
I like to watch her spin 'round and 'round
Sweat dripping down her neck
And I do quite like
Imagining things sometimes

[Bridge]
Well I heard a tale that the good lord gives and he takes
He speaks in fires and earthquakes
And I got all these terrible things in my head
Wonder what he thinks about them

[Outro]
(Good Lord gives and he takes)
(Pay for one more drink)
(I'll give you a ride)
(Well I know it's getting late
Parked outside
Hang for a while
I'll give you a ride)

[Verse]
I said, "Okay, well, lean against the headrest
You could use more rest"
And I said, "I think the caps kickin' in
I saw some crazy flickerin' over here"
So I whistled for the dog to come
And I shivered and went dark all at once
Was that the cap kicking in?
Then I asked you again, "Did you see it?"
Pretty lights drift in
And pretty lights drift out
Some strange shifts sideways
Over and about

[Verse 1]
Listenin' to Gillian Welch
Ooh, I can't help myself
Look at Miss Ohio
That ain't how you smile though
I like it when you
Talk down, turn the radio down
I like it when you
Talk down, turn the radio down
Listen to The Band by The Band
Honey, I hold your hand
Your eyes look tired
I like it when you
Talk down, turn the radio down
I like it when you
Talk down, turn the radio down

[Chorus]
And when you speak
I might bend to listen to you
Hallelujah, my God
Fast asleep in the back of my car
I like it when you talk do-o-o-own
I like it when you talk do-o-o-own
And when you speak
I might bend to listen to you
Hallelujah, my God
Windows foggin' up in my car
I like it when you talk do-o-o-own
I like it when you talk do-o-o-own

[Verse 2]
(Verse two, let's do it)
You put on Liz Phair
And you lean back in your chair
Then you turn the dial low
I got 50 miles
I like it when you
Talk down, turn the radio down
I like it when you
Talk down, turn the radio—
Every little kiss
Or Nebraska, you blush when I ask ya
Questions 'bout your past, ah
I like it when you
Talk down, turn the radio down
I like it when you
Talk down, turn the radio down

[Chorus]
And when you speak
I might bend to listen to you
Hallelujah, my God
Fast asleep in the back of my car
I like it when you talk do-o-o-own
I like it when you talk do-o-o-own
And when you speak
I might bend to listen to you
Hallelujah, my God (My God)
Windows foggin' up in my car
I like it when you talk do-o-o-own
I like it when you talk do-o-o-own

[Intro]
(We're loving you to the moon
Sorry, but I had to do that
I'm sorry, but I had to do that)

[Verse 1]
I know that you've been healed
By somebody else
I know that you've been healed
By somebody else

[Chorus]
Who gets your magic?
Who gets your spells?
Who turns the world up on itself?
Oh, yeah
Tell me

[Verse 2]
I know that you've been healed
By somebody else
I know that you've been held
By somebody else

[Chorus]
Who gets your magic?
Who gets your spells?
Go circle dancing by myself
Oh, yeah
Yeah

[Intro]
I-I-I've been
Keeping to myself and staying out the way
I've been
Always on my lonely 'cause I can't change
I-I've been
Seeing how they talking, and I'm outraged
I-I've been
Taking care of me, don't need a damn thing

[Chorus]
I've been living on an island too
I-I've been living on an island too
I-I've been living on an island too
I-I've been living on an island too (Yeah)
Tell me, can we—?

[Verse 1]
Shawty suck my dick, then I got lost in the abyss
I'm a quiet motherfucker, but I like to talk my shit
I'm off a shroom, I'm off a bean, I'm off a whole lotta shit
You could bet I'm in my head, but you could bet I'm in your bitch (Baby, can we?—)
Look, these niggas be my sons, without me, they'd be done
Where thе fuck would you get all your mood board pictures from?
That's why I been living on this island with my blunt
Ignoring all thesе niggas 'cause my energy is priceless

[Chorus]
I've been living on an island too
I-I've been living on an island too
I-I've been living on an island too
I-I've been living on an island too
Tell me, can we—?

[Bridge]
I've been keeping to myself and staying out the way
I've been always on my lonely 'cause I can't change
I-I've been seeing how they talking, and I'm outraged
I-I've been taking care of me, don't need a damn thing
(Baby, can we—?)

[Verse 2]
Look, my energy is priceless, told my jeweler, "Ice this"
I'm way too decisive, don't catch that ego-itis
When I'm up in London, everybody say, "Your Highness"
Not because I'm royal, but because I be the highest
Sippin' champagne, bitch, I do my damn thing
Born for this like Matt Dam', red whip look like Chastain
People be so phony, that's why I be on my lonely
People be so phony, that's why I be on my lonely

[Chorus]
I-I-I've been living on an island too
I-I've been living on an island too
I-I've been living on an island too
I-I've been living on an island too
(Baby, can we?)

[Outro]
People be so phony, that's why I be on my lonely
People be so phony, that's why I be on my lonely, lonely
People be so phony, that's why I be on my lonely, lonely, lonely
Sippin' champagne, bitch, I do my damn thing
Born for this like Matt Dam', red whip look like Chastain
Sippin' champagne, bitch, I do my damn thing
Born for this like Matt Dam', red whip look like Chastain

[Verse 1]
Comin' down fast just a little more
Devil keeps pushin' me further
Swimmin' in the darkness on my own
But baby, I'm a real quick learner
Thought that you could break me
But I could never break so easy
Believe me, it's about to get real, real messy

[Pre-Chorus]
Trust no, I learn the hard way
Skin turned into armor, babe
Now I'm numb to everything

[Chorus]
The lines have changed, starting to blur
Thought you had my number, but the tables have turned
There's ice in my veins, nothing can hurt me now
Feel no pain, you won't see me coming
I'm a perfect weapon

[Verse 2]
You cover your tracks and close the door
Thinkin' you can hide in shadows
Got you in my sites, I'm ready for war
You better get prepared for battle
You thought that you could break me
But I could never break so easy
Believe me, it's already real, real messy

[Pre-Chorus]
Trust no, I learn the hard way
Skin turned into armor, babe
Now I'm numb to everything

[Chorus]
The lines have changed, starting to blur
Thought you had my number, but the tables have turned
There's ice in my veins, nothing can hurt me now
Feel no pain, you won't see me coming
I'm a perfect weapon
The lines have changed, starting to blur
Thought you had my number, but the tables have turned
There's ice in my veins, nothing can hurt me now
Feel no pain, you won't see me coming
I'm a perfect weapon

[Outro]
I'm a perfect weapon
Lyrics

Light the incense (incense)
Not to mention (mention), skin like Whiskey (Whiskey)
She's cold like on the rocks
(La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la)
I still love smoking ZaZa

Chorus

Light the incense
Lose the tension feels like Heaven
Lust mixed with a vodka
(La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la)
Feelings get lost in the LaLa

Happy but you're unhappy (we in this)
Shorty, you're so valid (yeah)
I'm ready when you're ready (ready)
Don't you know eyes can be so deadly?
Try not to think, but you made me
It's just a G thing, baby (baby)
All in my satin sheets, you're laying (laying)

Walked through the door, there you were
Bought you Louis, Fendi, etcetera
Woman, you should've told me you were dangerous
Woman, you should've told me you were medicine (here we go)

Put it on me like you said you would
Fell so hard like you said you would
Love out of this world (la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la)
Out of this Nebula
It's best to just, put you on my schedule

Chorus

Light the incense (incense)
Not to mention (mention), skin like Whiskey (Whiskey)
She's cold like on the rocks
(La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la )
I still love smoking ZaZa

Light the incense
Lose the tension feels like Heaven
Lust mixed with a vodka
(La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la)
Feelings get lost in the LaLa
Listen (here we go, we in this)
Healthy indecisions
Tryna fight it would be so ridiculous (yeah)
I'm ready when you're ready
Someone watching would be so jealous
Try not to think, but you made me
It's just a G thing, baby (baby)
All in my satin sheets, you're laying

Put it on me like you said you would
Fell so hard like you said you would
Love out of this world, out of this Nebula
It's special, put you on my schedule

Chorus

Light the incense (incense)
Not to mention (mention), skin like Whiskey (Whiskey)
She's cold like on the rocks
(La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la)

[Verse]
I will always be here
I will always look out from behind these eyes
It's only a lifetime
It's only a lifetime
It's only a lifetime

[Verse 1]
I have always been here
I have always looked out from behind these eyes
It feels like more than a lifetime
Feels like more than a lifetime

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I get tired of the waiting
Sometimes I get tired of being in here
Is this the way that it's always been?
Could it ever have been different?

[Verse 3]
Do you ever get tired of the waiting?
Do you ever get tired of being in there?
Don't worry, nobody lives forever
Nobody lives forever

[Verse 1]
One sound, one single sound
One kiss, one single kiss
A face outside the window pane
However did it come to this?
A man who ran, a child who cried
A girl who heard, a voice that lied
The sun that burned a fiery red
The vision of an empty bed

[Verse 2]
The use of force, he was so tough
She'll soon submit, she's had enough
The march of fate, the broken will
Someone is lying very still
He has laughed and he has cried
He has fought and he has died
He's just the same as all the rest
He's not the worst and he's not the best

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
And still, this ceaseless murmuring
The babbling that I brook
Seas of faces, eyes upraised
The empty screen, the vacant look
Man in black on a snow white horse
Pointless life has run its course
Red-rimmed eyes, the tears still run
As he fades into the setting sun

[Verse 1]
A restless eye across a weary room
A glazed look and I was on the road to ruin
The music played and played as we whirled without end
No hint, no word, her honour to defend
"I will, I will" she sighed to my request
And then she tossed her mane while my resolve was put to the test
Then drowned in desire, our souls on fire
I led the way to the funeral pyre
And without a thought of the consequence
I gave in to my decadence

[Chorus]
One slip, and down the hole we fall
It seems to take no time at all
A momentary lapse of reason
That binds a life for life
A small regret you won't forget
There'll be no sleep in here tonight

[Verse 2]
Was it love or was it the idea of being in love?
Or was it the hand of fate that seemed to fit just like a glove?
The moment slipped by and soon the seeds were sown
The year grew late and neither one wanted to remain alone

[Chorus]
One slip, and down the hole we fall
It seems to take no time at all
A momentary lapse of reason
That binds a life to a life
The one regret you will never forget
There'll be no sleep in here tonight

[Verse 1]
Dogs of war and men of hate
With no cause, we don't discriminate
Discovery is to be disowned
Our currency is flesh and bone
Hell opened up and put on sale
Gather round and haggle
For hard cash we will lie and deceive
Even our masters don't know the webs we weave

[Chorus]
One world, it's a battleground
One world and we will smash it down
One world
One world

[Verse 2]
Invisible transfers and long distance calls
Hollow laughter in marble halls
Steps have been takеn, a silent uproar
Has unleashed thе dogs of war
You can't stop what has begun
Signed and sealed, they deliver oblivion
We all have our dark side to say the least
And dealing in death is the nature of the beast

[Chorus]
One world, it's a battleground
One world and they're gonna smash it down
One world
One world

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
One world
One world

[Saxophone Solo]

[Verse 3]
The dogs of war won't negotiate
The dogs of war won't capitulate
They will take and you will give
And you must die so that they may live
You can knock at any door
But wherever you go, you know they've been there before
Well, winners can lose and things can get strained
But whatever you change, you know the dogs remain

[Chorus]
One world, it's a battleground
One world and we're gonna smash it down
One world
One world

[Outro]
One world
One world

[Interlude: Nick Mason]
When the child-like view of the world went, nothing replaced it
Nothing replaced it
Nothing replaced it (Nothing replaced it, nothing replaced it)
I do not like being asked to (Nothing replaced it)
I do not like being asked to (I do not like being asked to)
Other people replaced it, someone who knows
Hey, yo, Jason
Say somethin' to her
Holla at her
I got one question
How do you fit all that in them jeans?
You know what to do with that big fat butt
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Just a little bit
Come on baby
Turn around
You're a star girl
Take a bow
It's just one thing that's killing me
How you get that in them jeans?
You know what to do with that big fat butt
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Just a little bit
Now make it clap
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Now make it clap
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Make it clap
Now makе it clap
Damn baby you got a bright future behind you

[Intro]
All the good girls go to Hell
'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the water starts to rise
And Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team

[Verse 1]
Standing there, killing time
Can't commit to anything but a crime
Peter's on vacation, an open invitation
Animals, evidence
Pearly Gates look more like a picket fence
Once you get inside 'em
Got friеnds but can't invite them

[Pre-Chorus]
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
All thе good girls go to Hell
'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the water starts to rise
And Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team

[Post-Chorus]
My Lucifer is lonely

[Verse 2]
Look at you needing me
You know I'm not your friend without some greenery
Walk in wearin' fetters
Peter should know better
Your cover up is caving in
Man is such a fool, why are we saving him?
Poisoning themselves now
Begging for our help, wow

[Pre-Chorus]
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
All the good girls go to Hell (All the good girls go to Hell)
'Cause even God herself (God herself) has enemies
And once the water starts to rise (Water starts to rise)
And Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team

[Post-Chorus]
My Lucifer is lonely
There's nothing left to save now
My god is gonna owe me
There's nothing left to save now

[Outro]
Haha!

That's just in my genes like I'm livin' it up
Teaching lesson in my dreams like I'm livin' it up

[?] on the beams, know I'm livin' it up
If it seems whatever it seems, know I'm livin' it up
Chrome rims in my dreams, you knowin' I'm livin' it up

The boys know I'm talkin' clean, on how I'm livin' it up
Yeah, house up in the hills, you knowin' I'm livin' it up
Top dollar bill, I gotta go live it up
And everybody know it's real, need everybody trust
But 

[?] know it's real but God will live in us
Ran out of town on top of my dreams, you knowin' I'm livin' up
Everything made of seams, I be it's

[Chorus: Kanye West & Dem Jointz]
We at the to-o-o-top-o-o, you know how it goes, oh
Led Zeppelin the shows, oh, we makin' it, loo-oo-ook, good, it’s so cold (Mooooooooooon)
Up to the moon, uh, oh-woah
I'm anointed, been appointed
Got a blunt in both hands, double jointed
I won't lie though, I enjoy it
Dippin’ coke, can't call it, won't spoil it
My swerve is like I just learned how to drive
My curve is when you don't get a reply
I learned love wasn't always in the eyes
That turn, I tippy toes, don't, slip

[Verse: Kanye West & Dem Jointz]
Take my (Ooh), time
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, (Ooh), I was throwing in the towel
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, (Ooh), I was almost givin' up
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, (Ooh), liquor had me throwin' up
Up, uh, uh, uh, (Ooh), I wish someone had enough
That’s the sign of growing up, they just don’t know what they want
And you just give it to 'em, huh?
Well, one time, off the li-i-i
Give it up for the ki-ki-id, (Ooh)

[Chorus: Kanye West & Dem Jointz]
We at the to-o-o-top-o-o, you know how it goes, oh
Led Zeppelin the shows, oh, we makin’ it, loo-oo-ook, good, it's so cold (Mooooooooooon)
Up to the moon, uh, oh-woah
I'm anointed, been appointed
Got a blunt in both hands, double jointed
I won't lie though, I enjoy it
Dippin’ coke, can't call it, won't spoil it
My swerve is like I just learned how to drive
My curve is when you don't get a reply
I learned love wasn't always in the eyes
Nat Turner, I tippy toes, don't, slip

[Verse 1]
And no-one here in New York
Can do me like you do
Fill my bed with roses
We're smashing up the room
I flew out here for diamonds
And all I got was broke
But the only thing worth chasing, is you

[Chorus]
And when the lights go down on Broadway
And the taxi's hard to find
I'm cryin' on the Brooklyn Bridge, well no-one seems to mind
I'm sure that you've moved on by now and I shouldn't have called, I know
But no-one here in New York seems to care that I'm alone

[Verse 2]
Strangers on the subway
Will make you go insane
You smile in their direction
They look the other way
Girls in my hotel room
Say my accent's kinda cute
But no-one here in New York, is you

[Chorus]
And when the lights go down on Broadway
And the music starts to fade
I'm cryin' on the Brooklyn Bridge, as strangers look away
I'm sure that you've moved on by now and I shouldn't have called I know
But no-one here in New York seems to care that I'm

[Bridge]
Alone somewhere I don't like, eatin' stuff off motorbikes
Calling in a day, I'm calling you
And sometimes doing fisticuffs reminds me of the two of us

[Chorus]
And when the lights go down on Broadway
And a taxi's hard to find
I'm cryin' on the Brooklyn Bridge, well no-one seems to mind
I'm sure that you've moved on by now and I shouldn't have called, I know
But no-one here in New York seems to care that I'm alone

[Verse 1]
I get out my records
When you go away
And people are talkin'
I miss what they say
'Cause it all means nothing, my dear
If I can't be holding you near
So tell me you love me
'Cause that's all I need to hear

[Verse 2]
I sit in my kitchen
With nothing to eat
With so many friends I
I don't wanna meet
'Cause I don't music in my ears
I don't need the crowds and the cheers
Just tell me you love me
'Cause that's all I need to hear

[Bridge]
And I've been so, so many times before
But hearin' it from you, means much more, so much more

[Verse 3]
Well pardon my message
And pick up my calls
You see I wrote you a letter
It was no use at all
And oh, I don't care if you're insincere
Just tell me what I wanna hear
You know where to find me
The place where we lived all these years, yeah
And tell me you love me
'Cause that's all I need to hear

[Outro]
And tell me you love me
And that's all I need to hear

[Verse 1]
Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground (oh, oh)
Only sound, only sound that you hear is "no"
You never saw it coming
Slipped when you started running
And now you've come undone and (I, I, I, I)
Seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees (eh, eh)
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade
Wish I could make it better
Someday you won’t remember
This pain you thought would last forever and ever

[Chorus 1]
There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, "I knew it all along"
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction

[Verse 2]
Just a shot, just a shot in the dark (oh, oh)
All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it coming
You hit the ground running
And now you're on to something
I, I, I say
What a sight, what a sight when the light came on
Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong
And in this perfect weather
It's like we don’t remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever

[Chorus 2]
There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, "I knew it all along"
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction
There you stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction, fiction

[Bridge]
I'll be one of the many saying
Look at you now, look at you now, now
I'll be one of the many saying
You made us proud, you made us proud, proud
I'll be one of the many saying
Look at you now, look at you now, now
I'll be one of the many saying
You made us proud, you made us proud, proud
And when they call your name
And they put your picture in a frame
You know that I'll be there time and again
'Cause I loved you when
When you hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you heard was "no"
Now in this perfect weather
It's like we don’t remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever

[Chorus 2]
There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, "I knew it all along"
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction
There you stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction, fiction

[Intro]
One, two, one, two, three

[Chorus]
Well, I taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
I'm gonna sit right here until I die

[Verse 1]
Well, I met her accidentally in St. Paul, Minnesota
She tore me up every time I heard her drawl, that Southern drawl
Well, I heard my dream went back downstream, cavorting in Davenport
Well, I follow you big river when you called

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tеars I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'ma gonna sit right hеre until I die

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Well, I followed her down to St. Louie, later on down the river
A trader said she's been here, but she's gone, boy, she's gone
Then I followed her down to Memphis
But she just walked off the bus
She raised a few eyebrows when she went on down alone

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Well, I've gotten on down to Baton Rouge, River Queen roll on
Take that woman down to New Orleans, New Orleans
I give up, 'cause I've had enough
Followed my blues on down to the gulf
She loves you big river more than me

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Taught that weeping willow how to cry cry cry
Taught the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky
Tears I cried for that woman are gonna flood you, big river
And I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Outro]
And I'm gonna sit right here until I die
And I'ma gonna sit right here until I die

[Chorus: Doja Cat]
Baby, when you fought me at the door
Kinda hard to force what's natural
Maybe you don't want what you need most
Is it crazy I'm not scared to be alone?

[Post-Chorus: Doja Cat]
Now I barely need ya
Do what you do best and be alone
Gotta tell him, "Rest in peace"
Bet you thought I'd die alone
It don't make sense to me
But I'll keep my head up high alone
You ain't even there for me
But now, you're scared to be alone

[Verse 1: Doja Cat]
Too many drinks to think about you
I had too many thoughts to let you wander
Now you're an afterthought, I lost ya
And now you want me, babe
You want me, but it's bye
Givin' me reasons to fly
Pack up my shit and be wise
Jump in the ride
Hit up my dude on the side
Like, look what you threw to the side
You get the vibe
Either we fuck or we fight
But I got the feelin' you're right
I'm out my mind
Doesn't make sense when I cry
If we can't make up, 'least we try

[Chorus: Doja Cat]
(On, oh, oh) Baby, when you fought me at the door (Fought me at the door)
Kinda hard to force what's natural (Oh, oh, oh)
Maybe you don't want what you need most (Oh, oh, oh)
Is it crazy I'm not scared to be alone? (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Doja Cat]
I ain't wanna share my dreams when it involves you
Not the man I need (Yeah)
Started feelin' like I failed my team
Missin' gigs for you, bet you never felt like me
Different levels to the game, that's fast
Spendin' bands last week while your ass act cheap (Yeah)
Lonely at the top while your ass miles deep
Got me thinkin' that you scared of yourself, not me
Impossible, from a Prius to gold carriages
Middle finger to you so you see what a whole karat is
I need an answer, a reader of more tarots
You couldn't tell that the both of us needed a whole therapist
I made you fam when I greeted your whole parents
But later, I realized they ain't teach you what no sharin' is
I know you hearin' this, I know you scared of it
But bein' lonely better than 'needs control,' cherish it

[Chorus: Doja Cat]
(Oh, oh, oh) Baby, when you fought me at the door (Fought me at the door)
Kinda hard to force what's natural (Oh, oh, oh)
Maybe you don't want what you need most (Oh, oh, oh)
Is it crazy I'm not scared to be alone?

[Post-Chorus: Doja Cat]
Now I barely need ya (I barely need ya)
Do what you do best and be alone
Gotta tell him, "Rest in peace"
Bet you thought I'd die alone
It don't make sense to me
But I'll keep my head up high alone
You ain't even there for me
But now, you're scared to be alone
Alone
Now you scared to be alone

[Verse 3: 

[?]]

[Verse 1]
On the day when I was born, Daddy sat down and cried
I had the mark just as plain as day that won't be denied
They say that Cain caught Abel rolling loaded dice
Ace of Spades behind his ear and him not thinking twice

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
If all you got to live for is what you left behind
Get yourself a powder charge and seal that silver mine
...transit, baby, a pile of smoking leather
I nailed a retread to my feet and prayеd for better weathеr

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
They say that when your ship comes in, first man takes the sails
Second takes the afterdeck, the third, the planks and rails
What's the point of calling shots
This cue ain't straight in line
Cue balls made of Styrofoam and no one's got the time

[Chorus]
Half-step, Mississippi uptown toodeloo
Hello, baby, I'm gone, goodbye
Half a cup of rock and rye
Farewell to you old Southern skies
I'm on my way, on my way, on my way

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river
Across the Rio Grande-o
Across the lazy river

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Laid back in an old saloon, with a peso in my hand
Watching flies and children on the street
And I catch a glimpse of black-eyed girls that giggle when I smile
There's a little boy that wants to shine my feet
And it's three days ride from Bakersfield and I don't know why I came
I guess I came to keep from paying dues
So instead I've got a bottle and a girl that's just fourteen
And a damn good case of the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

[Verse 2]
She said her name was Billie Jean and she was fresh in town
I didn't know a stage line ran from Hell
She had raven hair, a ruffled dress, a necklace full of gold
All the French perfume you'd care to smell
She took me up into her room and whispered in my ear
"Go on, my friend, do anything you choose"
Now I'm payin' for those happy hours I spent there in her arms
With a lifetime's worth of the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Chorus]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When the devil wants to take it all away?
Cherish well your thoughts, and keep a tight grip on your booze
'Cause thinkin' and drinkin' are all I have today

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Then a man rode into town, some thought he was the law
Billie Jean was waiting when he came
Told me he would take her, if I didn't use my gun
I'd have no one but myself to blame
I went down to those dusty streets, blood was on my mind
I guess that stranger hadn't heard the news
'Cause I shot first and killed him, oh Lord, he didn't even draw
And now I spend my lifetime running with the Mexicali Blues, yeah

[Outro]
Is there anything a man don't stand to lose
When he lets a woman hold him in her hands?
You just might find yourself out there on horseback in the dark
Just riding and running across those desert sands, yeah

Thank you

[Verse 1]
My mama told me, my papa told me, too
Well, my mama told me, papa told me, too
Well, I wouldn't be here trying to sing these railroad blues

Wish I had a-listened, oh, to what my mama said
Wish I had a-listened, oh, to what my mama said
And I wouldn't be here trying to sleep in this cold iron bed

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Mister jailer, go away now, don't tell me no lies
Mister jailer, go away now, don't tell me no lies
Well, the train rolling down, she's rolling down the line

I went to the depot, never got there on timе
Went down to the depot, nеver got there on time
Well, that train rollng down, she's rolling down the line

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Wish I had a-listened, oh, to what my mama said
Wish I had a-listened, oh-oh, to what my mama said
Well, I wouldn't be here trying to sleep in this cold iron bed
Well, my mama told me, my papa told me, too
Well, my mama told me, papa told me, too
Well, I wouldn't be here trying to sing these railroad blues

[Verse 1]
Bringing me down
I'm running aground
Blind in the light of the interstate cars
Passing me by
The buses and semis
Plunging like stones from a slingshot on Mars
But I'm here by the road
Bound to the load
I picked up in ten thousand cafés and bars
Alone with the rush of the drivers that won't pick me up
The highway, the moon, the clouds, and the stars

[Chorus]
Black-throated wind keeps on pouring in
With its words of a life where nothing is new
Ah, Mother American Night, I'm lost from the light
Oh Lord, and I'm drowning in you

[Verse 2]
Now, I left St. Louis, City of Blues
In the midst of a storm I'd rather forget
I tried to pretend it camе to an end
'Cause you werеn't the woman I once thought I'd met
But I can't deny, times have gone by
I never had doubts or thoughts of regret
And I was a man when all this began
Who'd never think twice about being there yet

[Chorus]
Black-throated wind whisper mix in
It's speaking of life that passes like dew
Forced me to see you've done better by me
Done better by me than I've done by you

[Verse 3]
What's to be found, racing around
You carry your bag wherever you go
Full of the blues, trying to lose
You ain't gonna learn what you don't wanna know
So I give you my eyes, and all of their lies
Please help them to learn as well as to see
You capture a glance, oh oh, and make it a dance
Of looking at you looking at me

[Outro]
Black-throated wind keeps on pouring in
With its words of a lie that could almost be true
Ah, Mother American Night, lost from the light
I'll turn around, that's what I'm gonna do
Well, I'm going back home, that's what I'm gonna do
I'm turning around, that's what I'm gonna do
Well, I'm going back home, that's what I'm gonna do
'Cause you've done better by me than I've done by you
Oh oh, and I'm drowning in you
I'm going, going back home, that's what I'm gonna do
Going, going, going back home, that's what I'm gonna do
Lord, you've done better by me than I've done by you
Oh oh, and I'm drowning in you
Going, going, going back home, that's what I'm gonna do
Well, you've done better by me than I've done by you
Oh oh oh, and I'm drowning in you
Oh oh, and I'm drowning in you

[Verse 1]
As I was walking 'round Grosvenor Square
Not a chill to the winter
But a nip to the air
From the other direction
She was calling my eye
It could be an illusion
But I might as well try
Might as well try

[Verse 2]
She had rings on her fingers
And bells on her shoes
I knew without asking
She was into the blues
She wore scarlet begonias
Tucked into her curls
I knew right away
She was not like other girls
Other girls

[Verse 3]
In the heat of the evening
When the dealing got rough
She was too pat to open
And too cool to bluff
I picked up my matches
And was closing the door
I had one of those flashes
I'd been there before
Been there before

[Bridge]
I ain't often right
But I've never been wrong
It seldom turns out the way
It does in the song
Once in a while
You get shown the light
In the strangest of places
If you look at it right

[Verse 4]
There ain't nothing wrong
With the way she moves
Or scarlet begonias
Or a touch of the blues
There's nothing wrong with
The look that's in her eye
I had to learn the hard way
To let her pass by
Let her pass by

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
The wind in the willows played tea for two
The sky was yellow and the sun was blue
Strangers stopping strangers
Just to shake their hand
Everybody's playing
In the Heart of Gold Band
Heart of Gold Band

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Well, this job I've got is a little too hard, uh-huh
I'm running out of money, Lord, I need more pay
I'm gonna wake up in the morning, Lord, I'm gonna pack my bag
I'm gonna beat it on down the line

[Chorus 1]
I'm going down the line
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Yes, I'm going down the line (Going down the line)
Going down the line (Going down the line)
Hey, uh-huh, well now, beat it on down the line

[Verse 2]
Yes, and I'll be waiting at the station, Lord, when that train pulls on by
I, I'm going back where I belong
Yes, and I'm going home to my same old used-to-be
Yes, down in Joe Brown's coal mine

[Chorus 2]
I said coal mine (Coal mine)
Whoa, coal mine (Coal mine)
I said coal mine (Coal mine)
Hey, hey, coal mine (Coal mine)
Yeah, yeah (Coal mine)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Coal mine)
Coal mine, well now, down in Joe Brown's coal mine
Rock on

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Yes, I'm going back to that shack way across the railroad track
Uh-huh, that's where I think I belong
Yes, I got a sweet woman, Lord, and she's waiting there for me
And that's where I'm gonna make my happy home

[Outro]
I said happy home (Happy home)
Whoa, happy home (Happy home)
Said a happy home (Happy home)
Said a happy, said a happy (Happy home)
Happy, happy, happy home (Happy home)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Happy home)
Happy home, well now, that's where I'm gonna make my happy home
Thank you

[Verse 1]
Cold iron shackles and ball and chain
Listen to the whistle of the evening train
You know you bound to wind up dead
If you don't head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Verse 2]
Rich man step on my poor head
When you get back you better butter my bread
Well, you know, people, it's like I said
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Drink all day and rock all night
The law come to get you if you don't walk right
Got a letter this morning, people, and all it read
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Verse 4]
Dropped four flights and cracked my spine
Honey, come quick with the iodine
Catch a few winks, baby, now under the bed
Then head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
I run into Charlie Phogg
He blacked my eye and he kicked my dog
My dog, he turned to me and he said:
Let's head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Verse 6]
I woke up a-feeling mean
I went down to play the slot machine
The wheels turned around, children, the letters read:
You better head back to Tennessee, Jed

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Tennessee, Tennessee
There ain't no place I'd rather be
Baby, won't you carry me
Back to Tennessee

[Verse 1]
Busted flat in Baton Rouge and waiting for a train
Feelin' near as faded as my jeans
Bobby flagged a diesel down, and just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans
I took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
I was blowin' sad while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slappin' time, Bobby clappin' hands
We planned to sing every song that driver knew

[Chorus]
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to do
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby sharеd the secrets of his soul
And standing right bеside me, Lord, through everything I've done
Bobby's body kept me from the cold
And somewhere near Salinas, Lord, I let her slip away
Lookin' for that home I hope she finds
And I'd trade all of my tomorrows for one single yesterday
Holdin' Bobby's body close to mine

[Chorus]
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to do
Nothin' was all she left for me
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

[Bridge]
Lelela, lelelaha, lalela, lelela
Laleleha, laleleha, ladada
Lelelehe, lala, lelelehe, lada
Leleleha, leleleha, lalala

[Chorus]
Well, freedom's just another word for nothin' left to do
Nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
Feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee

[Verse 1]
When they come to take you down
When they bring that wagon 'round
When they come to call on you
And drag your poor body down

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, it's just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
You thought you was the cool fool
Never could do no wrong
You had everything sewn up tight
How come you lay awake all night long?

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Know in spite of all you gained
Still have to stand out in the pouring rain
One last voice is calling you
And I guess it's time you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Shake it up now, Sugaree
I'll meet you at the Jubilee
If that Jubilee don't come
Maybe I'll meet you on the run

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one thing I ask of you, just one thing for me
Please forget you knew my name, my darling Sugaree

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me
Shake it, shake it, Sugaree
Just don't tell them you know me

[Verse 1: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine
We can share what we got of yours 'cause we done shared all of mine
Keep on rollin', just a mile to go
Keep on rollin' my old buddy, you're movin' much too slow

[Verse 2: Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir]
I just jumped the watchman, right outside the fence
Took his rings, four bucks in change, ain't that Heaven sent?
Hurts my ears to listen, Shannon, it burns my eyes to see
Cut down a man in cold blood, Shannon, it might as well've been me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3: Bob Weir]
We used to play for silver, now we play for life
One's for sport and one's for blood at the point of a knife
But now the die is shaken, now the die must fall
There ain't a winner in this game, he don't go home with all
Not with all

[Verse 4: The Grateful Dead]
Leavin' Texas, fourth day of July
Sun so hot, the clouds so low, the eagles filled the sky
Catch the Detroit Lightning out of Sante Fe
Great Northern out of Cheyenne, from sea to shining sea

[Verse 5: Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir]
Gotta go to Tulsa, first train we can ride
Gotta settle one old score, one small point of pride
Ain't a place a man can hide, Shannon, will keep him from the sun
Ain't a bed can give us rest, you keep us on the run

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 6: The Grateful Dead]
Jack Straw from Wichita
Cut his buddy down
Dug for him a shallow grave
And laid his body down
Half a mile from Tucson
By the morning light
One man gone and another to go
My old buddy, you're moving much too slow

[Outro: The Grateful Dead]
We can share the women, we can share the wine

[Verse 1]
Annie laid her head down in the roses
She had ribbons, ribbons, ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I could not leave her there

[Chorus]
I don’t know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I could not leave her there

[Verse 2]
Ten years the waves rolled the ships home from the sea
Thinking well how it may blow in all good company
If I tell another what your own lips told to me
Let me lay 'neath the roses, let my eyes no longer see

[Chorus]
I don’t know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I could not leave her there

[Verse 3]
One pane of glass in the window
No one is complaining though
Come in and shut the door
Faded is the crimson from the ribbons that she wore
And it's strange how no one comes 'round anymore

[Chorus]
I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I could not leave her there

[Verse 4]
Annie laid her head down in the roses
She had ribbons, ribbons, ribbons in her long brown hair
I don't know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I could not leave her there

[Chorus]
I don't know, it must have been the roses
The roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair
I don’t know, maybe it was the roses
All I know, I could not leave her there

[Verse 1]
Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Night time would find me in Rosa's Cantina
Music would play and Felina would whirl

Black as the night were the eyes of Felina
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was strong for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain I could tell

[Bridge]
One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina, the girl that I love
So in anger

[Verse 2]
I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for thе gun that he wore
My challengе was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor
Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance and that was to run

[Bridge]
Out through the back door of Rosa's I ran
Out where the horses were tied
I picked a good one, he looked like he could run
Up on his back and away I did ride
Just as fast as I

[Verse 3]
Could from the West Texas town of El Paso
Out through the badlands of New Mexico
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life, nothing is left
But it's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death

[Bridge]
I saddled up and away I did go, riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
Tonight nothing's worse than this pain in my heart
And at last here I

[Verse 4]
Am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's Cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Felina I go

Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me
I've got to make it to Rosa's back door

[Bridge]
Something is dreadfully wrong, for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
It's getting harder to stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary, unable to ride
But my love for

[Verse 5]
Felina is strong
And I writhe where I've fallen
Though I am weary, I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

From out of nowhere, Felina has found me
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss and Felina goodbye

[Verse 1]
Loose Lucy is my delight
She come running and we ball all night

[Chorus 1]
Round and round and round and round
(Round and round and round)
Don't take much to get me on the ground
I'm a yo-yo, here's my string
Listen to the birds on the hot wire sing
Yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Singing "Thank you, for a real good time"

[Verse 2]
I got jumped coming home last night
Shadow in the alley turned off all my lights

[Chorus 2]
Round and round and round and round
(Round and round and round)
Don't take much to get me on the ground
Loose Lucy, she was sore
I know you don't want my love no more
Singing, yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Singing "Thank you, for a real good time"

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Be-bop baby, how can this be?
I know you've been out and cheating on me

[Chorus 3]
Round and round and round and round
(Round and round and round)
Don't take much to get the word around
Cross my heart and hope to die
I was just hanging out with the other guys
Singing, yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Singing "Thank you, for a real good time"

[Verse 4]
I went back home with two black eyes
You know I'll love you 'til the day I die

[Chorus 3]
Round and round and round and round
(Round and round and round and round)
It don't take much to get the word around
I'm not yours but I like your type
Don't shake the tree where the fruit ain't ripe
Singing yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah) Yeah (Yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
Yeah (Yeah), yeah (Yeah), yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Singing yeah (Yeah), yeah (Yeah), yeah (Yeah, yeah)
"Thank you, for a real good time"

[Verse 1]
My baby gives me the finance blues
Tax me to the limit of my revenues
Now here she come finger-popping clickety click
She says "Furs or diamonds, you can take your pick"

[Chorus]
She wants money
(What she wants)
She wants money
(What she wants)
She wants money
(What she wants)
She wants money
(What she wants)
Money, money (Money, money, money)
Money, money (Money, money, money)

[Verse 2]
Now, she says "Money, honey", I draw a blank
I just load my gun and mosey down to the bank
And knocking off my neighborhood savings and loan
To keep my sweet chiquita in eau de cologne

[Chorus]
She wants money
(What she wants)
She wants money
(What she wants)
She wants money
(What she wants)
She wants money
(What she wants)
Money, money (Money, money, money)
Money, money (Money, money, money)

[Bridge]
Now, mama, don't send me down to rob that bank again
I got a notion you're leading me to sin
Won't you relax, won't you lay way back
Don't you bug your honey about no Cadillac
It's only bucks, you don't need no jack
So won't you please relax and lay way back

[Verse 3]
My baby's lovin' gives me such a thrill
It gives me inspiration making counterfeit bills
Now, some folks say the best things in life are free
I sure don't get no lovin' living honestly

[Chorus]
She wants money
(What she wants)
She wants money
(What she wants)
She wants money
(What she wants)
She wants money
(What she wants)
Woo, money, money (Money, money, money)
Money, money (Money, money, money)

[Verse 4]
Lord made a lady out of Adam's rib
Next thing you know you got women's lib
Lovely to look upon, heaven to touch
It's a real shame they got to cost so much

[Chorus]
She wants money
(What she wants)
She wants money
(What she wants)
She wants money
(What she wants)
She wants money
(What she wants)
Woo, money, money (Money, money, money)
Money, money (Money, money, money)

[Outro]
Money, money (Money, money, money)
Money, money (Money, money, money)

[Verse 1]
Look for a while at the china cat sunflower
Proud walking jingle in the midnight sun
Copperdome bodhi drip a silver kimono
Like a crazy quilt stargown through a dream night wind

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Krazy Kat peeking through a lace bandanna
Like a one-eyed cheshire, like a diamond-eye jack
A leaf of all colors plays a golden-string fiddle
To a double-e waterfall over my back

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Comic book colors on a violin river crying a lot of
Words from out a silk trombone
I rang a silent bell, beneath a shower of pearls
In the eagle-winged palace of the Queen Chinee

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Verse 1]
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
Laid down last night, Lord, I could not take my rest
My mind was wandering like the wild geese in the West

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
The sun will shine in my back door someday
The sun will shine in my back door someday
March winds will blow all my troubles away

[Verse 3]
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I wish I was a headlight, on a northbound train
I'd shine my light through the cool Colorado rain

[Chorus]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone, gone, gonе
I know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gonе, gone, gone
Gonna miss your baby, from rolling in your arms

We're gonna take a short break and we'll be back in a few minutes, so everybody hang loose

[Verse 1]
I left my home in Norfolk, Virginia
California on my mind
Straddled that Greyhound, it rode me past Raleigh
And on across Carolin'
Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill
And we never was a minute late
And we was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown
Rolling across the Georgia state
Had motor trouble, it turned into a struggle
Halfway across Alabam'
The Hound broke down
And left us all stranded in downtown Birmingham

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Straight off bought me a through train ticket
Right across Mississippi clean
And I was on that midnight flyer out of Birmingham
Smoking into New Orleans
Now somebody help me get out of Louisiana
Just help me get to Houston town
Therе's people therе who care a little about me
And they won't let the poor boy down
Well, sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit
Put luggage in my hand
And I woke up high over Albuquerque
On a jet to the promised land

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Working on a T-bone steak a la carte
And flying over to the Golden State
The pilot told us in thirteen minutes
We'd be heading in the terminal gate
Swing low sweet chariot, come down easy
Taxi to the terminal zone
Cut your engines and cool your wings
And let me make it to the telephone
Los Angeles, give me Norfolk, Virginia
Tidewater four ten oh nine
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land calling
And the poor boy's on the line

[Verse 1]
I had a hard run
Running from your window
I was all night running
I wonder if you care
I had a run-in
Run around and run down
Run around a corner, corner
Lord, I run smack into a tree

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Verse 2]
Dressed myself in green
Lord, I went down under the sea
Try to see what's going down
Lord, and read between the lines
I had a feeling I was falling, falling, falling
I turned around to see
Heard a voice calling, calling, calling
It's running back to me

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymorе

[Verse 3]
Ran into a rainstorm
I ducked back into a bar door
It was all night pouring
But not a drop on me
Test mе, test me, test me, test me
Why don't you arrest me?
Throw me in the jailhouse
Lord, until the sun goes down

[Chorus]
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Chorus]
I had to move

That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore

[Outro]

Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore
I had to move
Really had to move
That's why if you please
I am on my bended knees
Bertha, don't you come around here anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
Anymore, anymore

I asked him to come on in out of the cold

[Pre-Chorus]
His brain was boiling, his reason was spent
If nothing is borrowed, nothing is lent
I asked him for mercy, he gave me a gun
Now and again, these things just got to be done

[Chorus]
Abraham and Isaac sitting on a fence
You'd get right to work if you had any sense
You know the one thing we need is a left-hand monkey wrench

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Gideon come in with his eyes on the floor
"You ain't got a hinge, you can't close the door"
Now, Moses stood up, a full six-foot-ten
Said, "You can't close the door when the wall's caved in"

[Pre-Chorus]
I asked him for water, he poured me some wine
We finished the bottle and broke into mine
You get what you come for, you're ready to go
And it's more than ten thousand that co
