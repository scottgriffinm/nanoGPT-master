ver backwards, now, would you be pleased?
Unlike the others, I'd do anything
I'm not the same, I have no shame
I'm on fire
C'mon, let go
Do you wanna see me down on my knees?
Or bending over backwards, now, would you be pleased?
Unlike the others, I'd do anything
I'm not the same, I have no shame
I'm on fire

[Outro]
Ooh, yeah, I'm burning up
Ooh, yeah, I'm burning up
Oh come on, oh come on, I'm burning up
Uh, uh, uh
I'm burning up
Ooh, yeah, I'm burning up
Oh come on, oh come on, I'm burning up
Ooh, yeah, I'm burning up
Uh, uh, uh
You know you got me burning up, baby
You know you got me burning up, baby
Burning up for your love
Burning up for your love
Burning up for your love
Burning up for your love

[Verse 1]
I don't know why I thought that you could make me happy
These tears I cry for you are so hopeless, yeah
I don't know why I thought that we were going somewhere
But you grabbed your coat and you were out the door
And now I know you don't care

[Chorus]
I know you're gonna take your love and run
I know you think I'm the foolish one
I know you're gonna turn around and say goodbye

[Verse 2]
I used to think you were my pretty angel coming down
Well now you've just proven me wrong
What about the letters we have written
All the things we've said and done
I'll just stand here while you count the battles you have won

[Chorus]
I know you're gonna take your love and run
I know you think I'm the foolish one
I know you're gonna turn around and say goodbye
I know it
But I'm not gonna cry for you
'Cause that's what you want me to do
No, I'm not gonna cry for you anymore
I know you're gonna take your love and run
I know you think I'm the foolish one
I know you're gonna turn around and say goodbye
I know it

[Bridge]
Take your love and run from me
Is this the way love's supposed to be?
You don't think that I can see
Hah, but you can't fool me

[Chorus]
But I'm not gonna cry for you
'Cause that's what you want me to do
No, I'm not gonna cry for you anymore
I know you're gonna take your love and run
I know you think I'm the foolish one
I know you're gonna turn around and say goodbye
I know it
I know you're gonna take your love and run
I know you think I'm the foolish one
I know you're gonna turn around and say goodbye
I know it

[Outro]
Take your love and run from me
'Cause it's the way love's supposed to be
You don't think that I can see

Holiday
Celebrate
Holiday
Celebrate

[Chorus]
If we took a holiday
Took some time to celebrate
Just one day out of life
It would be
It would be so nice

[Verse 1]
Everybody spread the word
We're gonna have a celebration
All across the world
In every nation

[Pre-Chorus]
It's time for the good times
Forget about the bad times, oh yeah
One day to come together, to release the pressure
We need a holiday

[Chorus]
If we took a holiday
Took some time to celebrate (Come on, let's celebrate)
Just one day out of life (Holiday)
It would be
It would be so nice

[Verse 2]
You can turn this world around
And bring back all of those happy days
Put your troubles down
It's time to celebrate

[Pre-Chorus]
Let love shine
And we will find
A way to come together and make things better
We need a holiday

[Chorus]
If we took a holiday (Holiday)
Took some time to celebrate (Celebrate)
Just one day out of life (Just one day)
It would be
It would be so nice

[Refrain]
Holiday
Celebrate

[Chorus]
If we took a holiday (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
Took some time to celebrate (Come on, let's celebrate)
Just one day out of life (Holiday)
It would be, it would be so nice

[Outro]
Holiday

[Verse 1]
I'm getting tired of waiting around
I feel like I'm always tracking you down
I don't wanna point my finger at you
But there's something you're forgetting
Here's what you better do, you better

[Chorus]
Think of me
I know you want to baby
Think of me (Of me, baby)
It won't be long before you
Think of me
'Cause I'll be gone and then you'll
Think of me, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
You walk in and you see me crying
You apologize say you lost track of time
I'm not gonna cry anymore
You're gonna lose me too
If you don't know what's good for you

[Chorus]
Think of me
I know you want to baby
Think of me (Of me, baby)
It won't be long before you
Think of me
'Cause I'll be gone and then you'll
Think of me, oh yeah

[Verse 3]
Tell me what I did to you
To make you treat me so badly
If you wanna see me anymore
If you don't wanna see me walking out the door, you better

[Chorus]
Think of me
I know you want to, baby
Think of me (Of me, baby)
It won't be long before you
Think of me
'Cause I'll be gone and then you'll
Think of me, oh yeah

You better think of me
Think, think, think of me (Think)
You know you're driving me crazy (Think)
You better, you better, you better
Think of me, oh yeah

[Bridge]
(Think) Stop wasting all my time
(Think, of me, baby)
You know, it could have been so fine
(Think) Hey, boy, I'm waiting on a sign
Don't you know there's someone else?
Stop thinking of yourself, you better

[Chorus]
Think of me
I know you want to, baby
(Think) You know you're driving me crazy
Think, think, think of me
You better think of me
Think, think, think of me
(Think, of me, baby)
Stop wasting all my time
(Think) You know, it could have been so fine
You better, you better
(Think)

[Chorus / Outro]
You better think of me
I know you want to, baby
(Think, of me, baby)
You know, you're driving me crazy
Think, think
Think, think of me
(Think) You better, you better
You better think of me
Stop wasting my all time
(Think, of me, baby)
You know, it could have been so fine
(Think) Hey, boy, I'm waiting on a sign
Don't you know there's someone else?
Stop thinking of yourself, you better

[Verse 1]
She's been down and out
She's been wrote about
She's been talked about constantly
She's been up and down
She's been pushed around
But they held her down, NYC
She has no regrets
She accepts the past
All these things they helped to make she
She's been lost and found
And she's still around
There's a reason for everything (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I've been holding on
Try to make me weak but I still stay strong
Put my life all up in these songs
Just so you can feel me
So you can get the real me

[Chorus]
So take me as I am (Take me as I am)
Or have nothing at all (Nothing at all)
Just take me as I am
Or have nothing at all (Nothing at all)

[Verse 2]
Yes, she's older now
Yes, she's wiser now
Can't disguise her now
She don't need no one tellin' her
What to do and say
No one tellin' her who to be
She's on solid ground
She's been lost and found
Now she answers to G-O-D
And she's confident this is not the end
Ask me how I know 'cause she is me (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I've been holdin' on (I've been holdin' on)
Try to make me weak but I still stay strong (Stay strong)
Put my life all up in these songs
Just so you can feel me
So you can get the real me

[Chorus]
So take me as I am
Or have nothing at all (At all)
Just take me as I am (As I am)
Or have nothing (Or nothing, baby) at all (This is me, this is me)

[Bridge]
So it's all or nothing at all
All or nothing at all
Don't you know I can only be me?
(I can only be me, yeah, I can only be me)
So it's all or nothing at all
All or nothing at all
Don't you know I can only be me?
(I can only be me, yeah)

[Chorus]
So take me as I am
Or have nothing at all
Just take me as I am
(I can only be me, yeah, I can only be me, yeah)
Or have nothing at all
(So take me, take me as I am or have nothing at all)

[Outro]
Take me as I am (Take me)
Take me as I am
Said it's all or nothing at all
Said it's all or nothing at all
Just take me as I am (Yeah)
Or have nothing at all
(Or nothing, baby, this is me, this is me)
Just take me as I am (Take me as I am)
Or have nothing, nothing at all (Take me as I am)
Just take me as I am (Take me as I am)
Or have nothing, nothing
Take me as I am

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
See now I don't wanna see an era, an era, an era
See now I just wanna live forever, and ever
Maybe it's the last night
Maybe it's the last night

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
When the world was discerned with this and that
I was young, didn't know to hold it back
Now we here and the world is something else
We could leave any day and call for help
We were gods, nobody was above me (Woo)
That "A" on my chest like adultery (Yeah)
That "A" on my chest, put your fist up (Yeah)
That "A" on my chest like a chipmunk
Alvin, Theodore
Breathe in, breathe out, mi amor
Breathe in, breathe out, never mind
It was time, number nine
L-L-Lies, feline with a death wish
Eatin' right, didn't help shit
No name on the guest list
Hold on, we were destined

[Chorus: Azealia Banks & Childish Gambino]
See now I don't wanna see an era (No) An era (No) an era
See now I just wanna live forever and ever
Maybe it’s the last night (You and me)
Maybe it’s the last night (Fireworks)
Maybe it’s the last night (Oh, oh, all the stars)
Maybe it’s the last night (Supermoon)
Maybe it's the last night

[Bridge: Azealia Banks]
All that I have
All I don't have's the future
Take on my soul
All night

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Yeah, break free from all of the insides
The godless denied us
But we don't give a damn 'bout the next day
We were never here, never know if the world change
Common sense, the consequences
Retweet the truth, then regret the mentions
We are the wireless survivors of things gone
Slaves to the unnamed, never live long
Live and die by the line, "Never know fear"
Even I won't survive, is it unfair?
Is it unfair? 'Cause I don't care
When I step on that ant on the grass
Progress only thing that'll last (Last, last)
3005, the year that we fear only God will survive
To be alone is alive

[Chorus: Childish Gambino, Azealia Banks & Both]
See now I don’t wanna see an era, an era, an era
See now I just wanna live forever and ever
Maybe it’s the last night
Maybe it’s the last night
Maybe it’s the last night
Maybe it’s the last night
Maybe it’s the last night
See now I don’t wanna see an era, an era, an era
See now I just wanna live forever and ever
Maybe it’s the last night
Maybe it’s the last night
Maybe it’s the last night
Maybe it’s the last night
Maybe it’s the last night

[Breakdown: Childish Gambino]
She got that body, oh me, oh my
Send them pics to my phone, GPOY
She got that body, oh me, oh my
Send them pics to my phone, GPOY
GPOY, GPOY
GPOY, GPOY
GPOY, GPOY
Send them pics to my phone, GPOY

[Outro: Childish Gambino]
So fly
Girl, you know you're so fly, so fly
Girl, I know I miss you
Girl, you know that I miss you
So fly
Girl, you know you're so fly, so fly
Girl, I know I miss you (I do)
Girl, you know that I miss you (I do, ooh)
You're so fly
Girl, you know you're so fly, so fly (I do, I do)
Girl, I know I miss you (Ah, I do)
Girl, you know that I miss you (I do, I do)
You're so fly
Girl, you know you're so fly, so fly (Ooh, ooh)
Girl, I know I miss you (Ooh)
Girl, you know that I miss you (Ooh, oh)

[Part 1]

[Intro]
Go!

[Verse 1]
Tears of joy now scare ourselves
From all that you want to be
Just got paid and now you're going
Round inside your place
If I get scared I'll just call you
And I'll miss your glow as I unsettle
Oh, and I'll always feel
I will always be-

[Part 2]

[Bridge]
-a'right
One, two, three
Four

[Verse 2]
So sell your suit and tie
And come and live with me
Leukemia schizophrenia
Polyethylene
There is no significant risk to your health
She used to be beautiful once as well

[Verse 3]
Plastic bag, middle class
Polyethylene
Decaffeinate, unleaded
Keep all surfaces clean
If you don't believe me, sell your soul
If you don't get into it, no one will

[Outro]
Oh
Obtain
Obtain

[Verse 1]
How'd you get your
Teeth so pearly?
Dew-drop dentures
White-washed fences

[Refrain]
She runs from the third world, pearly

[Verse 2]
Vanilla (Feel it crawl to me) milkshakes (Crawl back again)
From Hard Rock (Whatever you say) Cafés (Make it go away)
That's where (I feel it crawl to me) she got her (Crawls back again)
Sweet tooth (Make it go away) for white boys (Whatever you say)

[Refrain]
She runs from the third world, pearly

[Outro]
Use me, darling use me
Darling use me, darling use me

[Spoken Intro]
Ukončete výstup a nástup, dveře se zavírají
Příští stanice, Jiřího z Poděbrad

[Verse 1]
If I get old, I will not give in
But if I do, remind me of this
Remind me that once I was free
Once I was cool, once I was me
And if I sit down and cross my arms
Hold me up to this song

[Bridge]
Knock me out, smash out my brains
If I take a chair, and start to talk shit

[Verse 2]
If I get old, remind me of this
The way that we kissed, and I really meant it
Whatever happens, if we're still speaking
Pick up the phone, play me this song

[Verse 1]
Don't forget that you are our son
Now go back to bed

[Verse 2]
We just know that you'll do well
You won't come to harm

[Verse 3]
Death to all who stand in your way
Wake, my dear

[Verse 1]
You stop the crowd
I cried out to break the spell
You wake and smile
I just snapped and lost control

[Chorus]
Distracted by irrelevance
The stress and the tension
The stress and the tension
I'm in a lull

[Verse 2]
There's nothing more dull
Than talking, talking about yourself
But what I meant to say
I'm sorry that I lost control

[Chorus]
Distracted by irrelevance
The stress and the tension
Crawling through the keyhole
I'm in a lull

[Intro]
Oh, we gon' have a party
All my friends will be there
We drink all the vodka
There's music everywhere
Now wait a minute (Wait a minute!)
Do you like to party?
'Cause if you don't (Oooohh-wah!)
Don't come over here
We got smoking, Blue Dream
Drinking, cocaine, fucking
I wanna show you what it is, ohh

[Verse]
Thought I was done but that wasn't the case
Got a new stack that I threw in your face
Got a new girl and she look Mila Kunis
Infinity pool and a statue that's Buddhist
Got bottles and bottles and bottles of Grino
Saw I was rich, now they fucking with 'Bino
Brown leather bag, the vacation Messina
The boat in the harbor, I rule the marina
10K for the drinks, now they say I'm insane
It's been that for a minute, now Hedi Slimane
I been black, lucrative, since Danity Kane
Who came back for a minute, now everything changed
High as a kite, lime in the light
Y'all niggas might whine every night
I ain't invite all these people to my motherfuckin' house
"Get the fuck out of my house!"

[Outro]
Yo, chill—
Hey, chill, man!

[Produced by Childish Gambino, Ludwig Göransson, & Pop Levi]

[Intro]
I'm fly

[Verse 1]
Man made the web, you don't need a name (Yeah)
Man made of faults, I ain't too ashamed
Every thought I had, put it in a box (Box)
Everybody see it just before the cops
Trolling, trolling, trolling these niggas
Rickrolling these niggas
They mad 'cause they don't know any better
"Hold up, it's the kid—quick, tell him he can't sit with us!"
Fuck it, got money, bought friends like I'm TBS
VVS, I can see it all with the clarity
Real deep, hope they dig a nigga 'fore they bury me
Even though we were told to go where they wouldn't go
Hella slow, that's that dial-up, watch it pile up, fly

[Chorus]
Andrew Auernheimer
Pulling on her weave, it's that Andrew Auernheimer
Andrew Auernheimer
Pulling on her weave, it's that Andrew Auernheimer
Andrew Auernheimer
Pulling on her weave, it's that Andrew Auernheimer
Andrew Auernheimer
Pulling on her weave, it's that Andrew Auernheimer

[Verse 2]
We are the dreams of our parents lost in the future
Who hide the deepest desires and wear a mask like a lucha—
Door open, we were smoking in the hotel
The vapors went through the hallway, the manager pissed as hell
I mean, where's the line between Donny-G and Gambino?
He hang with girls like he Lena, but needed some time to re-up
Tequila in the cantina, thirty dollars I swallowed
The Sauza so malo (I nuzzled my Nyla)
And then she said, "You need to grow up
You been doing this for too long
That Camp was a million years ago, sing me a different song"
Whether you're trolling or controlling, just a reminder
You think you get it, you don't, it's that Andrew Auernheimer
I'm gone—now I'm back
Give a fuck or give 'em hell, just not a chance to react
Tyler Durden, this burden hurting, they said there was curtains
Certain demise, look in his eyes, the pain inadvertent
I could've stayed where I was and had a life you'd be proud of
But I'd rather chase things never thought of
It was all love, saying, "Go hard"
Making dope, it's a trap; Ackbar backfired
Panic dreams, so it seems we're meant to die
I had to figure it out; "It's the best," no, that's a lie
Had to get some stuff off my chest, I vaporized
High on my own, it took time to realize
Because the Internet, mistakes are forever
But if we fuck up on this journey, at least we're together
Man, I wish I could go back and tell that kid it's make-believe
Make him believe in himself, people who needed my help
Feelings I felt, killing myself, no one's ever been this lost
I just get the information, retweet it or say it sucks
I just got the motivation, your talent's just bunch of luck
Hard work and dedication, but lately it's run amok
Waking up in these places I don't remember
Texts from people I never met, doors left open
(Who is this? Don't do it, where are you?
Who is this? Who is this?) I don't know who I am anymore
Still on the beat though
Still in the game, but he move with a cheat code
Slowest connection ever, my life inside a computer
Them bands that'll make her dance, my wallet's Lollapalooza
The violence, first-person shooter
First person to move, first person to speak
My mils aren't meek, they scream in the streets
Losing my frame of reference, these pieces of shit for breakfast
Funny, the day you born, that's really your death sentence
I met this girl at a dinner, we conversatin'
She beautiful in the face, but her voice is truly amazing
Plus she write her own shit, becoming so close knit
Smoke up and talk in the evening, she helping me focus
No Anna Nicole Smith, she getting hers
Niggas take her props, like a musical, live and learn
She say she feel alone all the time, I'm similar
I meet her in my dreams, on the moon, I visit her
Every night I text her, "I wanna solve the world, I think I need your help"
She text me, "How you gon' trust somebody when you don't trust yourself?"
I mean she right though, .45 like a lightbulb
And I could've died like my iPhone, but I kept going like a psycho
And I took Chance like a dice roll, dropping jewels like it's puberty
Wrote a note on the glass: "You see what these labels do to me?"
Text said, "I'm wet"; I said, "Hold up, wait a minute"
H2O plus my D, that's my hood, I'm living in it
Never forget this feeling, never gon' reach a million
Eventually all my followers realize they don't need a leader
Stay on your own shit, fuck what these clones think
Just remember that you the shit, but act like it don't stink
We were childish, but had to grow up
When you spitting real shit, eventually you throw up
Realities like allergies, I'm afraid to go nuts
"Life: The Biggest Troll", but the joke is on us
Yeah, the joke's you showed up

[Outro]
You're here now
You have to help me
You have to help me
I need you—you have to help me
You have to help me
You have to help me
Please help me
Please help me
Please, please help me
Please—

[Chorus: Miguel]
Don't go, gotta know, please don't run away
I'm a murderer, what can I say?
Don't go, gotta know, please don't run away
I'm a murderer, what does that change?

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
Can't sleep
3 a.m., stare at the ceiling, murder the feeling
Spider crawl in the corner, brown recluse
So appropriate, cornucopia, so be it, say I'm over it
Playing Lil Durk, "Dis Ain't What U Want"
Look at my feet, I put my sneakers in the trunk
Pass a Fatburger through Atwater village
Laugh for a minute, couldn't cry for the life of me
Park by the bridge, sit on the hood
Look at the cars, stare at my hands, look at the moon
I can't find it, it's gone, what's wrong?
"Didn't respond when I texted you last night"
"You alright?"—yeah...

[Chorus: Miguel]
Don't go, gotta know, please don't run away
I'm a murderer, what can I say?
Don't go, gotta know, please don't run away
I'm a murderer, what does that change?

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Man is a star bound to a body inside of me
Twenty million degrees, burn a man to his knees
Late at night in a hurry, bought a McFlurry
And half of an apple pie, when I'm laughing, I'm satisfied
When I'm dying, I'm still alive, strange position
I'm in a good mood, so good, I'ma kill that spider
In spite of the kinda things that they told me
Alone don't mean that you lonely
Alone means you finally get it, admit it
Go home, lock up the door, fold up the clothes
Watch some cartoons, turn off the lights
Look at the recluse, look at the recluse
Look at the recluse, look at the rec—

[Chorus: Miguel]
Don't go, gotta know, please don't run away
I'm a murderer, what can I say?
Don't go, gotta know, please don't run away
I'm a murderer, what does that change?

[Outro: Miguel]
(Don't go, don't go)
(Don't go, don't go)
Don't go, don't go
Don't go, don't go-ooo

[Intro: Childish Gambino]
When we were coming down, they said it was too soon
I never had to lie, no, no, no, no
When we were coming down, they left us all alone
We're headed nowhere, nowhere
I know you've been around, I feel you in and out
How are you? Do you sleep? Are you with me?
We used to be unspoken
Now everything is broken, I'm a good son
You're a good son
You're a good son, oh
You're a good son
Oh, you're a good son

Free information, free information

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
Arlanda, hotel to the bar
Young girl with an accent with her back bent
Ass out to the whole world
We can vibe out for the night
Stepping outside for a light
No coke and I just smoke vapor, no papers
Slow poke and I don't know 'bout photos
Let's go though
How old are you?
Saying that you never date older dudes
Why I never wanna say no to you
The coldest dude to hold a groove with no kids
The coldest dude who can't hold his Goose (Woo!)
"I'ma walk out; wanna walk too?"
What about dude?
"Fuck him, I just really wanna feel something"

[Interlude: Kilo Kish]
It took me like, five minutes to figure out
Like, where the voice memos were on the phone
But I figured it out
Okay, so, can we just–

[Chorus: Kilo Kish]
Is it real 'cause you're online?
Is it real 'cause you're online?
Is it real 'cause you're online?
Is it real 'cause you're online?

I'm a freaky bitch
I am five-foot-eight, 390
And I am a freaky bitch

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Heathen, it's a struggle just to keep breathing
Existential asthmatic, puff, puff, pass addict
Craftmatic, making moves, but they sleeping on me
We can kick it like it's FIFA, homie
Nevertheless, I got that fresh like it was Crest
Grind 'cause I'm stressed
TMJ or TMI, it's a lie that you're living
I never understood the hate on a nigga preference
When every marriage is a same-sex marriage
Same sex everyday, monotonous
Lost God, never pray, forgotten us
Lost love, never say it just like our parents
Too much power ain't enough power
Brain splattered like I've fallen off a watch tower
And anybody can walk into any Denny's
And wait 'til I'm walkin' in it
With a gun that they 3D printed and finish it
Kinison said, "If you gon' miss Heaven, why do it by two inches?"
Old money and new bitches
Old money and new bitches

And all the time, oh-oh, yeah
(Act like you know, act like you know, act like you know)

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
How could you ever question? They know better to mention
The Budget truck ain't just enough to make her pay attention
The who, what, why and where, they sport the flyest pairs
She got the nicest hair and she know life is better with this nigga
It's crazy how the world look different
It's crazy how the girls look different
The colors and the sounds so vivid
You never catch your boy po-pimpin'
Me sittin' on the sidewalk, now that don't sound right
But as long as I look fly by prom night—go

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
Rainbows (Ho!), sunshine
Rainbows (Ho!), sunshine
Rainbows, sunshine, yeah
Rainbows, sunshine

[Interlude: Jhené Aiko]
*harmonizing*

[Verse 2: Jhené Aiko]
He slangs his yay through the corridors
Every day, 20K, yep, at the very least, for sure
And they say there's no way, I should stay with someone like you
But I tell them, "No"
There's no way I could stray, gotta stay with someone like you
'Cause I know one day you could take me away, far away
I know you could pay all the money you made
There'll be plenty of sunshine

[Refrain: Childish Gambino]
I never worry 'bout it
(Act like you know, act like you know, act like you know)
I have my nigga count it, no, no
(Back up them O's, back up them O's, back up them O's)
She's dressed up in gold
(Dressed up in gold, C3PO, C3PO)
I'm out of time, oh, no, no, no
(Act like you know, act like you know, act like you know)

[Outro: Childish Gambino]
I'm out of time, oh, no, no, no, no
I'm out of time, ooh
I'm out of time, out of time
La-la-la, la-la-la (Go)

[Intro: Robin Gibb]
One year, two years, time goes by
People laugh and people cry

[Verse 1: Robin Gibb]
Every morning the clock strikes eight
I go to work, I close the gate
And on my way, I sing a song
About my wife, where I belong

[Bridge: Robin Gibb]
If the clouds get together
And talk about the weather
If it's rain they anticipate
Baby, make no mistake
Yes, the storm will break
But never me you see

[Hook: Robin Gibb and Barry Gibb]
2 years on, 2 years on
But only you can see me
Only you can see me

[Verse 3: Robin Gibb]
For what I've got
Sir Lancelot was just a dream
And I am not
For I am he with something more
It's you and I reality

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Outro]
2 years on, 2 years on, ah

[Verse 1: Barry Gibb]
Everybody wants to leave
Just like you and I
I have all year to smile
A tear for every eye

[Chorus: Robin Gibb and Barry Gibb]
Life closed it's eyes
Broke my world, now I cry
I've got to tell you
I've got the reasons
Cause I'm a man
A man for all seasons, alive

[Verse 2: Barry Gibb]
And would I pray
What makes the world go round
I haven't got today
My mind is lost and found

[Chorus]
Du du du du du du du

[Outro]
I'm a man for all seasons
I'm a man for all seasons
I'm a man for all seasons
I'm a man for all seasons

rivke asked: some background on that pic (from wiki): In March 1993, while on a trip to Sudan, Carter was preparing to photograph a starving toddler trying to reach a feeding center when a vulture landed nearby. Carter later said that he waited 20 minutes to see if the vulture would flare its wings. He finally took a picture and then chased off the vulture. However, he came under criticism for failing to help the girl:
The St. Petersburg Times in Florida said this of Carter: "The man adjusting his lens to take just the right frame of her suffering, might just as well be a predator, another vulture on the scene."
Sold to the New York Times, the photograph first appeared on March 26, 1993. Hundreds of people contacted the newspaper to ask the fate of the girl. The paper reported that it was unknown whether she had managed to reach the feeding center. In 1994, the photograph won Pulitzer Prize.
Carter later committed suicide. This photograph raises issue about photographers and their relationship to their subjects.

[Verse 1]
Keys to an open door, it don't mean a lot
Stains on a dirty floor, you don’t see a spot
What do I mean, what do I mean to you?
Waging a war inside you, but don’t see the scars
You got the moon guide you, who needs a star?
What do I mean, tell me, what do I mean to you?

[Chorus]
What do I mean to you?
What do I mean to you?
What do I, what do I mean to you?

[Verse 2]
No need for water, Rita, you got the wine
Searching for diamonds when I gave you the mine
What do I mean?
Tell me, what do I mean to you, to you?

I'm a believer, Jesus (hallelujah)
Show me the light
The side of the road, the devil gave you a ride
What do I mean?
Tell me, what do I mean to you?
Hallelujah

[Chorus]
What do I mean to you?
What do I mean to you?
What do I, what do I mean to you?

[Bridge]
A child needs a mother
And you want trust but not the truth
I’m just a lover
So what do I mean to you?

[Chorus]
What do I mean to you?
What do I mean to you?
What do I, what do I mean to you?

[Verse 1]
You can't stop the world
You can't do it all alone
It's too heavy for
You to carry all alone
But tonight you are
Mine
The world will be fine
It's just us in this moment
So

[Chorus]
Don't think about the world
Stop blaming yourself
I know you do
Don't think about the world
Just me and you
Tonight

[Verse 2]
No I can't fly
Can't swim across the sea
I don't wonder why
It's just the way its gotta be
I love that you care
And I know that you're scared
It's just in this moment

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Don't stress for nothing
Let me take you away
From all the madness
Just give in to me today
'cause you're all I want
Youre all I need
Right here and now
It's you and me

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Stars fade
Hearts break
Fair trade
Is it ever even
Don't wait
To stay
Awake
When you realize

[Pre-Chorus]
That time just keeps on moving
While you're standing next to living in the dark

[Chorus]
So neon, neon
Burn up the sky, just like a fantasy where all that I can see is
Neon, neon
Show me your light, I'm running out of time so give me a sign
Neon, neon, neon
Give me a sign, neon
Neon, neon
Give me a sign, neon

[Verse 2]
Sun-set
Strip, red
Lights they
Always call my name
And I
Don't want more time
Won't kill me

[Pre-Chorus]
That time just keeps on moving
While you're standing next to living in the dark

[Chorus]
So neon, neon
Burn up the sky, just like a fantasy where all that I can see is
Neon, neon
Show me your light, I'm running out of time so give me a sign
Neon, neon, neon
Give me a sign, neon
Neon, neon
Give me a sign, neon

[Bridge]
I've been looking for the reason
What's the answer or the meaning of it all
All
Hoping that you're gonna show me just
You're always here glowing in the dark
Yeah
Neon
Neon

[Chorus]
So neon, neon
Burn up the sky, just like a fantasy where all that I can see is
Neon, neon
Show me your light, I'm running out of time so give me a sign
Neon, neon, neon
Give me a sign, neon
Neon, neon
Give me a sign, neon

[Verse 1]
Somebody find a waiter
Our lips are dry
Another round for the table
Hold the ice
Pardon me 'cause I'm staring
Oh my god
I can marry that smile you're wearing
And I just might

[Chorus]
Wow
Look at us right now
Finally we're found, found, found, found, found
Run
Go ahead and run around
See how quick you're found, found, found, found, found

[Verse 2]
Sophisticated California
The kids gotta grow
This kinda life is bound to bore you
Yeah, I should know
But you always seem to break the rhythm
Of this messed up world
And there's no way that I'm ever leaving
Without you girl and...

[Chorus]
Wow
Look at us right now
Finally we're found, found, found, found, found (finally)
Run
Go ahead and run around
See how quick you're found, found, found, found, found

[Bridge]
Tell me you want me to love you
Tell me you'll never stopped
I'll be around yeah you're never lost

[Chorus]
Wow
Look at us right now
Finally we're found, found, found, found, found
Baby, you should run
Go ahead and run around
And see how quick you're found, found, found, found, found, yeah

[fadeout]

[Verse 1: Robin Gibb]
Burning embers, I still remember
All of those little things
But I don't feel it so much
'cause I am so out of touch
With my heart and it won't sing
Rusty rainbows
That's how the pain goes
Turning me inside out
Well, I come home at night
And you are out of my sight
Yes, I'm dying and there ain't no doubt
Well, I'm dying and there's no way out

[Hook: Robin Gibb]
Well, I try, try, try, try, try
Mr. Natural, come on baby
When I walk in the rain you won't know that I'm crying
A smile on my face and I'm trying

[Post-Hook: Barry Gibb and Robin Gibb]
I'm trying to understand
That a love that is lost can never be found again
And you see me dance, I look like a happy man

[Verse 2: Barry Gibb]
Just when I think I'm getting it over
An old friend I should see
He said he knew you well
And baby I could tell
You know, he knew you even more then me
I went home laughing
And inside I'm crying
We had a special thing
You know I loved you so much
But girl I'm so out of touch
With my heart and it won't sing
You know my heart just won't sing

[Hook]

[Post-Hook]

[Outro]
Still I try, try, try, try, try, try
Mr. Natural, come on baby
Well, I try, try, try, try, try
Mr. Natural, come on baby
Well, I try, try, try, try, try, try
Mr. Natural, come on baby
Well, I try, try, try, try, try
Mr. Natural, come on baby
Well, I try, try, try, try, try
Mr. Natural, come on baby

[Verse 1]
I was hungry and I was cold
Had a father far too old
Couldn't make it to the place he'd like to be
In a tree trunk in the park
He was living in the dark
Keeping other dogs like him for company
And in the evening I'd go down
To a nightclub in the town
Try to get some bread to make another way
And back to the park I'd go
Dig him out of the snow
You know he's lived a thousand years
From day to day

[Bridge]
Well, the days get shorter
And the nights get longer
And you never learn to know
If you love one another
Could you look at each other
Could it ever really show?
If at this moment in time
You couldn't make up your mind
Now could you ever understand?

[Chorus]
Are you following me
Just like Moses to the sea?
Do you think I'll give you freedom in the end?
When I'm long dead and gone
Will your love for me go on?
Will I be the one you run to in the end?
And all my dogs need a friend

[Verse 2]
It was a quarter to three
In the summer of '73
When I heard somebody call outside my door
Said, "Are you friend or are you foe?"
He looked up and he said "No
But I'd like to come inside and know you more"

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I ain't got no claim to nothing
I don't mess with anyone
I walk my way living in a masquerade
And one day I looked behind me
At all the things I've done
That's the 1st mistake I ever made

[Chorus]
I was born to a lonely women in a town called Buffalo
Never knew the man who never stayed
With my 12-string on my back
I discovered every track
That's the 1st mistake I have made

[Verse 2]
With a million hearts I've broken
I never kept the score
Memories of good love hate to stay
But I still remember someone
Who loved me so much more
That's the 1st mistake I ever made

[Bridge]
So, when nothing's worth the living
And in the night I look above
Prayed, about a million times I prayed
I know my story ended
When I lost my only love
That's the 1st mistake I have made

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
The game ain't changed, just a new breed
As you'll see fans turned over a new leaf
I know it's hard to swallow that's how the truth be
Heard I'm gettin' dollars got you lookin' for the new me
A lot of niggas on they own shit, I do me
I'm one hundred everything I talk you'll see
And I'ma chase that bread 'til I'm filthy
I keep money on the wig like ya girl's weave
And I kill beats
That's probably why they think hip hop's dead, cause I spit hot lead
Feel like I just got fed, so I'm nowhere near comfortable
Even though they tell me can't no one here fuck with you
Bitches scream my name, real niggas say "I fucks with you"
I grind no days off that's how a hustler do
And I'm accustomed to creatin' that real shit
That money motivate you can feel shit
Ya dug me?

[Hook]
That paper on my mind, I'ma grind 'til I'm finished
I'm feelin' like I, I gotta get it, I, I gotta get it
And realistically, the sky is the limit
I'm out here so I, I gotta get it, I, I gotta get it
Niggas slackin' on they grind intuition
They slippin' so I, I gotta get it, I, I gotta get it
Yeah yeah and change the life I'm livin'
That's out here for me - so I, I gotta get it (yeah!)

[Verse 2]
I never thought about falling back
It's big change in this game, I need all that
Roll sticks of Mary Jane like a ball bap
Big business here, that's what you can call that
Heard I signed to Warner Bros., yeah that's all facts
I been hot now the shots, I'ma call that
Flow cray, some say I was born mad
And I came feet first, nigga this a rebirth
Man, I got rhymes like a nigga keep work
To get paid like the 15th and the 1st
Stuck to my grind, did my thing and it worked
Now all the little bussies wanting me getting to work
I'm either blowin ray, Sour Diesel or purp
And reppin' Pittsburgh til I'm layin' in the dirt
What you say could get you murked
That's just how it go down here
And that money ain't slow out here
Niggas bubblin'

[Hook]
That paper on my mind, I'ma grind 'til I'm finished
I'm feelin' like I, I gotta get it, I, I gotta get it
And realistically, the sky is the limit
I'm out here so I, I gotta get it, I, I gotta get it
Niggas slackin' on they grind intuition
They slippin' so I, I gotta get it, I, I gotta get it
Yeah yeah and change the life I'm livin'
That's out here for me - so I, I gotta get it (yeah!)

[Chorus]
Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

[Verse 1]
When you rolled up in the Escalade
Saw the dub you gave to the valet
Knew that it was game when you looked at me
Pulling up your sleeve so I could see the Rollie bling
Saw you later in the corner booth
Raising up a toast, so I would notice you
But you're hard to miss, think you oughta know
Doesn't matter if you're balling out of control

[Pre-Chorus]
All that matters is
That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy, yeah

[Chorus]
Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't (Ooh)
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

[Verse 2]
When I took a chance thought you'd understand (You don't understand)
Baby, credit cards aren't romance
So you're trying to buy what's already yours
What I need from you is not available in stores
Seen a side of you (You) that I really feel (Feel)
Doing way too much (Much), never keep it real (Real)
If it doesn't change, gotta hit the road
Now I'm leaving, where's my keys? I've got to go

[Pre-Chorus]
All that matters is
That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy, yeah

[Chorus]
Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't (Baby)
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing (Love don't cost a thing)
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't (No)
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

[Bridge]
Love don't cost a thing, a thing, a thing
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You think the money that you make (That you make)
Can substitute the time you take (The time you take)
To get the keys into my heart
Think you can win my heart, don't know what's in my heart (Don't cost a thing)
I think you need to take some time
To show me that your love is true (Ooh)
There's more than dollar signs in you
Then you can win my heart, and get what's in my heart

[Chorus]
Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing (Love don't cost a thing)
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke (Even if you were broke)
My love don't cost a thing (My love don't cost a thing)
Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't (Think I wanna)
If I wanna floss, I got my own (If I wanna, don't)
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't (Think I wanna)
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't (If I want my own)
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't (Think I wanna)
If I wanna floss, I got my own (If I want my own)
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

[Verse 1: Robin Gibb]
I held a party and nobody came
Strangely I was upset
Poured out a drink and then Birkworth approached
Saying "Have no regrets"

[Hook: Barry Gibb]
Maybe your gentle friends had some delay
Don't try and take on the world

True

[Verse 2: Robin and Barry]
Made up my bed and decided to sleep
Dreaming I was awake
Maybe I drank in excess of my drink
Nice clan cordial crowd

[Hook 2: Barry Gibb]
Birkworth suggested we speak through the night
I never knew him so well

[Outro]
Ahh ahh ahh

[Verse 1]
I can make the sun shine
Out of the heavens
Sweet love
Love you forever

[Hook]
Just wait until
The sun's on your pillow
I can bring love 'cause that's all I've got
I can bring love 'cause that's all I've got

[Verse 2]
I can change the whole world
If you are near me
No tears
If you can hear me

[Hook]
Yeah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah

[Hook]
I can bring love 'cause that's all I've got
Yeah yeah yeah

[Intro]
Yeah
Swisher Sweets, no Phillies
Yeah

[Verse: Wiz Khalifa]
Me I'm riding clean, smoking good, can barely keep my eyes open
Listening to my favorite song, leaning in my ride chokin'
Tell my dog to hit this weed, feel like I'm finna pass out
Thought I had exclusive trees, until he pulled his bag out
Had bout a half ounce, some shit I've never seen in life
Said that once he grabbed it, smelled so bad he had to bag it twice
I told him roll that shit up, this weed I had to light
These clowns somewhere in the clouds, me I'm a satellite
I roll them very nice, with smoke coming out the end like a muffler
Got game from the Hustla, never said I'm gon' quit
I can't get enough of good weed in my lungs, plus I'm sharin' I ain't cuffin'
My eyes wide shut, I'm just staring saying nothing
I flick ashes, got big staus, so I don't need a dime, I got big baggage, bitch
Yeah I blow it by the zip, anywhere I go it's on the road on every trip
Ask my Nini, love her grandson but she know that I'm a trip
Got my habit from Ms. Peachy smoking roaches getting lit
Now I fill my blunts with so much weed they say "that all ain't gon' fit"
On some highly grown shit, with a Hollywood bitch
Got the sweetest purple kush in a precisely rolled spliff
High as John in Pulp Fic' on the way to see Marcellus
Girl I'm in another world, and Chevy got another twirl
For those who don't know he got that roll game
And I ain't gon' lie, he the reason why I got my roll game
I feel like I'm soul plane, I smoked the whole thang, pound or oz
Kush fiend, purple master OG
(Yea that's a little bit of kush talk for y'all niggas who might not comprehend)
And every nigga that grow weed should know me
My leather so soft, my Swisher so sweet bitch

[Outro: Talking]
Ya, this Young Khalifa man
Mr. blow it by the iddo, yup
And I've been state to state man, from here to there
Smoke the best of the best, you know?

How a nigga feel grinding for the bigger dough

Had to let these niggas know, youngin' with a sicker flow
And you knew the name, you can call me who to blame
For what I do to the game, fuck it I just do my thing
And I been focused on this rapping since the moola came
I make that money come back just like a boomerang
You dudes are losers lames blowing flips and losing change
A fly guy such as myself will come and scoop ya dame
The game is up for grabs and I'ma be the next to win it
Young but I'm a boss man, all you dudes is just beginners
And no soul when the flow's cold I spit December
You fools clones with no souls you such pretenders

And where I'm from a lot of niggas on some slavery shit
You know the chains and whips, they get the 'caine and flip

Other niggas get trapped up in the game and they brains get split
Either that or they get knocked and they man turn bitch
Take the stand and they man turn snitch
This is the land where you gotta keep ya grass low, fucking snakes love to hate
Never let 'em stop ya dough, gotta learn to love the hate
Make ya moves, I've been on the grind since an early teen
Spittin' crack and servin' fiends, nothin' but raw 16s

[Verse 2]
Okay, look

Smokin' blunts and 40's, and all that shit
That shit look cool and all that? That shit ain't cool, man
Y'know what I'm sayin'? Your head-

[verse 1: Barry Gibb]
Yesterday was history who knows
What there is gonna be when we meet again?
Will you smile and tell the world about me?
Can there be no doubt about me I was your friend?

[Hook: Barry Gibb]
As I gaze upon a sea of smiling faces
Walk amongst the glow of moonlit places
The look in your eyes, to see your smile
Won't bring you back to me

[Verse 2: Robin Gibb]
I remember things we planned
The world would never understand but we found a way
And the world of love you gave to me
Each moment is a memory, whatever they say

[Hook: Barry Gibb]

For the look in your eye, to see your smile
Won't bring you back to me

[Verse 1: Barry and Robin]

[Hook: Barry Gibb]
For the look in your eye, to see your smile
Won't bring you back to me

[Outro: Barry Gibb]
For the look in your eye, to see your smile
Won't bring you back to me
For the look in your eye, to see your smile
Won't bring you back to me

[Robin Gibb]
Every time I need reality, yeah
In jeopardy of losing all of me

[Barry Gibb]
I just am not stronger
Life don't last so long so baby

[Hook: Robin and Barry]
If you turned out the lights
If you turned out the lights
Please don't turn out the lights
Please don't turn out the lights
Turn out the lights

[Robin]
Baby, I don't feel too reliable
I can only do what I'm liable

[Barry]
But if you want to leave me
Love me and just leave me baby

[Hook]
Turn out the lights
The sun shines down on a South Dakota morning
And I can see their faces in my eyes
I wish they were behind me
My enemy can find me
If only to remind me
That I'm really not alone
All the South Dakota mornings I have known

The eagle flies on a South Dakota morning
And I don't see my eagle anymore
Now stranger I must kill you
You must survive but will you
I may just beat you down
But will it even up the score
I think I saw the eagle just once more

The rain comes down on a South Dakota morning
And I can't see the sadness in my town
So let it be my pillow
For underneath your willow
Wanna go back to you though
You're nothing but a town
On the South Dakota grass I lay me down
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1: Robin Gibb]
Sweet simple song
Of different lights and different shades
The sound of life erupts and fades
And all the world must play along
My life has been a song

[Verse 2: Robin Gibb]
Here as I sleep
The love I dream will gently creep
Inside my heart I softly keep
The tune that plays too long
My life has been a song

[Hook: Barry Gibb]
Every sound in my head
Every word that I said
Is like a melody, melody
That no little person like me
Could ever change
Every sound in the street
All the cold and the heat
Is like a symphony, symphony
Which has never before been rearranged

[Verse 1: Robin Gibb]

[Hook: Barry Gibb

[Verse 1: Robin Gibb]

[Hook: Barry Gibb]

[Verse 1: Barry Gibb]
Summer nights
We made our love in the sand
And at the dawn
We held our love hand in hand
And we listened
To music the ocean was playing
The words that our two hearts were saying
That only two lovers can hear

[Chorus: Barry Gibb and Robin Gibb]
Let us ride on the wind
While this moment is real
You're the light of my life
You are welcome to my charade

[Post-Chorus: Robin Gibb]
And this feeling
Knowing you blessed me forever
And believing
I have been touched by your love

[Barry Gibb]
And the pleasure of knowing
That evening won't tear us apart

[Chorus 2: Barry and Robin]
We can follow the sun
Till the daylight is gone
We can gaze at the sky
Till the night is over
Light of my life
You are welcome to my charade

[Post-Chorus 2: Barry Gibb]
And this feeling
Of knowing you've blessed me forever

[Chorus 2: Barry and Robin]

[Post-Chorus 2: Robin Gibb]
And this feeling
Knowing you've blessed me forever

[Chorus 2: Barry and Robin]
My binoculars on, alone
Staring out of my window
I see the best creation of
Woman that I ever saw in
A long, long time

Some say it is wrong
But what if she knows
That I am spying on her
Would she strip down
Naked and entertain me

Oh my God she's doing it

Taking it of (x5)

She's getting naked (x4)

She threw her shirt
(Off on the floor)
Then threw her bra
(Off on the floor)
Then threw her skirt
(Off on the floor)
Then threw her drawers
(Off on the floor)
(I can't believe )
(She's getting naked)
(X4)
I'm wanting her, off on the floor
On top of her, off on the floor
No stopping her, off on the floor

She knows I'm watching her, off on the floor...

(I can't believe)
(She's getting naked)
(X4)


My binoculars on, alone
Staring out of my window
I see the best creation of
Woman that I ever saw in
A long, long time


Some say it is wrong
But what if she knows
That I am spying on her
Would she strip down
Naked and entertain me

Oh my God she's doing it

Taking it of (x5)

She's getting naked (x4)

She threw her shirt
(Off on the floor)
Then threw her bra
(Off on the floor)
Then threw her skirt
(Off on the floor)
Then threw her drawers
(Off on the floor)

I can't believe
(She's getting naked)
(X4)

I'm wanting her, off on the floor
On top of her, off on the floor
No stopping her, off on the floor

She knows I'm watching her, off on the floor...
I can't believe
(She's getting naked)
(X4)

My binoculars on, alone
Staring out my the window
I see the best creation of
Woman that I ever saw in
A long, long time

Some say it is wrong
But what if she knows
That I am spying on her
Would she strip down
Naked and entertain me

Oh my God she's doing it
TAKING IT OFF!


My binoculars on, alone
Staring out of my window, taking it off
I see the best creation of
Woman that I ever saw in
A long, long time, taking it off

Some say it is wrong
But what if she knows

[Verse 1]
George was born somewhere
Inside London town
Working as he grew
For that extra pound
Respected by all
He married and made a home
To give his children
More than he had known

[Chorus]
But then he died
Without an explanation
He never lied
A very sincere relation

[Verse 2]
Years before a fire
Sent him in the street
It took him months of work
To make ends meet

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Summers come and summers go
But I need the rain
All your vines will overgrow
And winds will blow insane

[Chorus]
But I'm not gonna move
And I won't make you cry
You can shelter in my home
And I won't ask you why

[Verse 2]
Friends will come and friends will go
But you stay on my train
All your wines will overflow
As winds will blow insane

[Chorus]
But I'm not gonna move
And I won't make you cry
You can shelter in my home
And I won't ask you why

[Chorus]
But I'm not gonna move
And I won't make you cry
You can shelter in my home
And I won't ask you why

You can shelter in my home
And I won't ask you why
You can shelter in my home
And I won't ask you why

[Verse 1: Robin Gibb]
'Leavin, that's all you ever seem to say
And I'm tired
The wants you have me for have expired
Sleeping and reading every book I can find
To get my mind off
In all I was a soul you were using

[Hook: Barry Gibb & Robin Gibb]
I am alone again
You can't believe the tears that I've shed
I'm on a bound down train
Don't desert me now or I am dead

[Verse 2: Robin Gibb]
People, the sun is going down on your heads
So read your paper
There's no one there for you to confide in
It's instinct
To always to have a shoulder to cry on
And to rely on
Someone there to share and to shine on

[Hook] 

[x3]
I am alone again
You can't believe the tears that I've shed
I'm on a bound down train
Don't desert me now or I am dead

[Verse 1]
Good morning, mister sunshine
You brighten up my day
Come sit beside me in your way

[Verse 2]
I see you every morning
Outside the restaurants
The music plays so nonchalant

[Chorus]
Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman?
Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman?
Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman?
Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman?

[Interlude]
Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman?

[Verse 3]
Good morning, mister sunshine
You brighten up my day
Come sit beside me in your way

[Outro]
Lonely days, lonely nights
Where would I be without my woman?
Lonely days, lonely nights
(Lonely days, lonely nights)
Where would I be without my woman?
(Lonely days, lonely nights) Yeah, yeah
Lonely days, lonely nights
(Lonely days, lonely nights)
Where would I be without my woman?
(Lonely days, lonely nights)
Lonely days, lonely nights
(Lonely days, lonely nights)
Where would I be without my woman?
(Lonely days, lonely nights) Yeah, yeah
Lonely days, lonely nights...

[Verse 1]
When you were mine
I gave you all of my money
Time after time
You done me wrong
It was just like a train
You let all my friends come over and meet
And you were so strange
You didn't have the decency to change the sheets
Oh girl, when you were mine
I used to let you wear all my clothes
You were so fine (So fine)
Maybe that's the reason
That it hurt me so

[Chorus]
I know (I know)
That you're going with another guy
I don't care (Don't care)
'Cause I love you, baby, that's no lie
I love you more than I did
When you were mine

[Verse 2]
When you were mine
You were kinda sorta my best friend
So I was blind (So blind)
I let you fool around
I never cared (Didn't care)
I never was the kind to make a fuss
When he was there
Sleeping in between the two of us

[Chorus]
I know (I know)
That you're going with another guy
I don't care (Don't care)
'Cause I love you, baby, that's no lie
I love you more than I did
When you were mine

[Bridge]
When you were mine
You were all I ever wanted to do
Now I spend my time
Following him whenever he's with you

[Chorus]
I know (I know)
That you're going with another guy
I don't care (Don't care)
'Cause I love you, baby, that's no lie
I love you more than I did
When you were mine

[Outro]
When you were mine, yeah, oh no
Love you, baby
Love you, baby
When you were mine
Wait a second, would you rather me not talk at all? ’Cause I don’t want to like, I don’t want to rattle no cages or nothing, I don’t want to like, I don’t want to get in trouble. I want to be scared. I’m trying my best to be scared. I’m trying my hardest to be scared. No, no, no, I don’t want to talk. I don’t want to talk at all. As a matter of fact I’m just going to tip-toe on this

I’m scared of anonymous comments online. I’m scared of them. These words affect me so much. They affect me so much. No, I’m sorry. I’m scared, I’m scared. I’m scared of these corporations, like, not giving me another deal that they didn’t give me already. I’m scared. I’m scared.  I’m so shook. I’m so, so scared. So scared. Soooo

You ain’t never seen, you ain’t ever seen, that my great, great, great, granddaddy somehow ended up on that boat. Somehow he ended up on that boat. But I know that we were royalty. I know we built the pyramids. I know anything is possible. I know anything is possible. And everybody has a moment in time and I picked y’all when I was walking in Madison Square Garden, I just wanted to make sure, thank y’all for giving me this moment in time. ’Cause everybody has a moment. And in your moment you gotta own it. There’s so many people have a moment and they don’t own it

You know, it’s so funny when people compliment me and they say the word genius, and somehow that like, separates me from rappers in some way, there’s the connotation of that. But what I need y’all to realize is Jay Z is a genius. And I need y’all to understand that Drake is a genius. I need y’all to understand that rap is an amazing way to express genius

’Cause just as an architect would build buildings, we put our words together to express the shit that we going through. We are the modern day poets, obviously. But why are so many writers so condescending to the rappers? Why do they try to classify us as musicians as being ignorant in some way? Why do they try to classify us, as far as the classes go? You know how it goes, right? I think it’s like a battle between art and architecture as the top. And if you’re an artist or an architect, you look down upon a fashion designer. And if you’re a fashion designer, you look down upon a musician. And if you a musician, you sign a deal with a corporation so you can buy a bigger house. And every time you go in the studio you watch your fucking mouth

You watch, you watch your fucking mouth. You don’t, you don’t want to lose this house. But when they write these history books, they’re not going to talk about what house we had. When they write the history books they aren’t going to talk about the money we made. They’re going to talk about the impact we had. They’re going to talk about the impact we had

And being that I saw The Hunger Games today, I wanted to bring up something, because it was very inspiring. It felt like almost a mimic of my exact life and shit. I know it. I was like, “Baby we gotta be on that movie board when they writing this shit.” And I saw Lenny Kravitz. There wouldn’t be no song called “Niggas in Paris” if it wasn’t for Lenny Kravitz. ’Cause that was the first nigga in Paris. Fucking with the models and shit, rocking Rick Owens head-to-toe and shit. Black. Rock. Star

But what’s interesting to me is like I was fond of hanging out with different people, in Paris, right. ’Cause Lenny Kravitz has like, the best taste. And he has like the dopest crib in Paris, everybody knows about it. And I don’t know if you know this, but he designs furniture, he designs lighting fixtures, and he had been working on a clothing line for a long, long, long, long, long, long, long time. Long time. Long, long, long, long time

And the designers would love it when Lenny Kravitz would show up at their fashion show. Yeah we gonna take some pictures of Lenny Kravitz and we gonna say he’s at the such and such show, and that’s gonna promote our brand. Hey Lenny, promote it the best you can. Hey Lenny, promote it the best you can. Hey Lenny, promote it the best you can. Best you can. Hey Kanye, promote it the best you can. Hey Kanye, promote us the best you can. From Paris to New York all the way to Japan. Hey Kanye, I mean Lenny, I mean any of you niggas, promote it the best you can. Any of you niggas promote if the best you can

So I said, “Wait a second, though.” I said, “I’ve got a dream of doing my clothing and I, I want to learn about furniture,” and you know what they told me when I was in Paris? You know when the W Magazine writer came out and wrote that classist-ass interview about me? You know what they said? You know what the billionaires told me? I went to about three or four different people and you know what they told me when I told them about my dreams? They said,  “Lenny Kravitz wanted the same, same thing.” They said, “Lenny Kravitz wanted the same, same thing.” Don’t let me sing because I want y’all to understand that I need to talk to you. They told me, “Hey that’s cute, that’s the same thing Lenny wanted to do.” Like it’s a motherfucking joke. It wouldn’t be no Kanye west if it wasn’t for Lenny Kravitz. You know what I’m saying?

But the only difference between me and Lenny Kravitz is I turned up on these niggas. I don’t give a fuck about looking cool or being cool. And this is no disrespect to Lenny. But they got this shit called cool, everybody want to look cool, everybody want to be cool, everybody don’t want to break their motherfucking cool, don’t nobody want to look like a fool
My boy 

[?], who used to work for Donda and now designs stages for Jay Z and Justin. The other day he said a word that I hadn’t heard people say before. And he said he was working at some corporation, and the head of the corporation is always like, kind of down on him and shit, and the word was to marginalize. To marginalize. And then he also said he tried to make him look like an idiot in front of people, right? So has anyone here tonight ever read a piece of press or saw something or heard something on the radio where they tried to make me look like an idiot? Wait a second, I don’t know, have you ever heard anything in the press where they’re trying to make me look stupid? You know what I’m saying, like I’m actually stupid. (Laughs) You know what I’m saying, like I’m not smart, like stupid. Like, like what the fuck is wrong with him? You know what I’m saying? Have y’all ever read or heard someone say, “I don’t like Kanye West”?
I’ll tell you something. Have you ever heard anyone talk shit about Lenny Kravitz though? He’s a nice guy. He’s a nice guy. He’s so well-mannered. I envy manners. I envy it. I envy people who are extremely likeable. I’m like, “Damn, I wish I could be likeable like them.” I wish people would like me like that

So what they basically did was, at Fashion Week… Let me explain something to you… I don’t give a fuck about fashion. I care about talent. I care about creativity. And it just so happens that with the advent of the Louis Vuitton bag, fashion rise to the top, and stole all of the creativity to only work for its small box, and sell it back to you at a higher price. That’s what the fuck fashion is to me. I care about dreamers. I care about heart. I care about soul. Not those who are marginalized

So if you think about someone like McQueen. Instead of being forced to make some fucking T-shirts with a skull on it, why wasn’t he allowed to make movies? He was just as good as Tarsem, he’s just a good a visualist as anyone else. But they would marginalize him as only a fashion designer. Which, let’s rewind, is above a music producer, and it’s above a rapper

’Cause you gotta stay in your tier, in your section. You gotta stay right there, you can’t move. But if you pay for a ticket, you wanted to come to see this show, and you standing right there, right? And when you’re trying to go you say I want to go up there, a security guard stops you, and then holds you, and if you start screaming the paparazzi catch you, catch you with your face looking all crazy, and then you scream out loud, and you got to really scream, you gotta say, “I am a god!” Just for them to let you a little bit up

But you know who fucked it up for everyone? Marc Jacobs. Because he gave two niggas a shot, me and Pharrell. He fucked the whole game up, and Pharell’s such a nice guy. ’Cause soon as I was able to make that Louis Vuitton sneaker, and the world reacted—I didn’t price it, but the world reacted to it—I got to see what it meant to create inside of that type of production facility. And wait a second, the same guy that was creative enough to make all of this 

[gestures back to his stage setup], that’s worn Jordans his whole life, could create a sneaker with Louis Vuitton and people reacted to that. And I said, I made another color. I did a pink model, and I did a red model, and I named them after my friends. I made one in Jasper after Ivan Jasper and one Mr. Hudson after Mr. Hudson, and one, the Louis Vuitton Don, for my nigga Don C. And that last day in the factory, I was going through the colors and it came to me, when they made me do a couple pictures and shit, and I called back after they sold out. And they said, “I’m sorry, Mr. West, but you’re not going to be able to create anything else in here. You’re not going to be able to create anything else again.” They said, “I’m sorry,” and I said, “But wait a second. I sold out.” They said, “I’m sorry Mr. West, you can never create anything else again.”

And right there, I was scared. Right there I was scared. ’Cause I thought that if I just went to their fashion show again and I just sat down like a good nigga they would let Lenny Kravitz get his shot! I thought maybe, maybe they would let Pharell get his shot. But no, no, no. Fuck you, nigga. Fuck you, nigga. Fuck you, nigga. Is that abrasive enough for you? ’Cause that’s what it is. Fuck you, nigga. Is that abrasive enough for you?

And what about Mark Parker, and what about Hedi Slimane? I thought Hedi Slimane was my friend, and that’s why I’m so hurt. How many names did people call me for wearing tight jeans when I’m the rapper that wore tight jeans and shit, that brought tight jeans to the ghetto and shit? I thought I was Hedi Slimane designing motherfuckin’ tight jeans that you want. I’m the nigga that, you know I’m rocking that shit. Then he had his first fashion show, and I was so happy for him. I was so, so, so happy for him. And he told me, you can come to my show, but you just can’t go to Riccardo’s show and you can’t go to Phoebe’s show

But he wouldn’t say that to Anna Wintour. He wouldn’t say that to 

[?]. And now his whole shit based off of rock and roll, and you trying to tell the number one rock star on the planet where the fuck he can go? So he can sell y’all, some motherfucking $10,000 pair of jeans? Fuck fashion. Fuck fashion. I mean, what’s the worst thing they gonna do, not help me again? What’s the worst they gonna do tell me I can’t go to these shows again? What’s the worst they gonna do, tell me that because I’m a musician, I don’t have any ideas for clothing again? What’s the worst they gonna do, marginalize me again? And never let Pharrell get his shot, and never let Lenny get his shot?

But I’mma tell y’all right now, I will take that spot. I am 2Pac of this clothing shit.  And I’mma take that spot, and we gonna combine all the creators, the best creators on the planet, and we gonna lower the motherfucking prices, so everybody can get it. And we ain’t gonna steal from people’s ideas like H&M. And we ain’t gonna steal people’s ideas like Zara. We gon’ make our own shit. We gon’ combine the best creators on the planet, and we gon’ take them from Harvard, and we gon’ take them from St. Mark's, and we gon’ take ’em from the street

And I’m sorry I went so long tonight. I know you just want to hear another motherfuckin’ hit song tonight. I’m so sorry I went so long tonight. I know you just want to hear another motherfuckin’ hit song tonight. Hit song tonight, hit song tonight. Another hit song, another hit song. Yes they do. I ask people about it, I tell them that I’m this creator, and they say I need another hit song. They say I need another hit song, hit song tonight, hit song…

Hold up, hold up. I’m sorry, if anyone out there thinks they can do anything, put your hands up right motherfuckin’ now! Almost forgot that part

[Verse 1]
Let there be love
So I can be loved by you
In Paradise Avenue
Let there be life
So everyone lives to love
Let it happen to me and you

[Chorus]
I am a man
So take me for what I am
I'll never have everything
But let there be love
Let there be love
Let there be love

[Bridge]
I can be nothing
Or I can be something
I've got to give you my life
I'm tired of living
Without your giving
I've got to get you for my wife
Can't hold on much longer
The feeling's getting stronger
I never begged, but I'm begging now

[Verse 2]
Let there be love
So I can be loved by you
In Paradise Avenue, oh yeah
Let there be life
So we can all live to love
And let it be both of us

[Chorus]
I am a man
So take me for what I am
I'll never have everything
But let there be love
Let there be love
Let there be love

[Intro: Justin Timberlake & (Timbaland)]
I don't understand it
Tell me, how could you be so low?
(And all in thrilling, new, living sound)
Dammit babe
(Dammit babe, dammit babe, dammit babe, dammit babe)

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Blood thicker than water, right
Fuck bitches, they all alike
Stand up nigga, not the fallin' type
Heart blacker than a Harlem night
Til I met you, they say the devil wear Prada
But I doubt it cause the Lord did bless you
Damn look at that body
Short bus shorty, cause it sure is special
Cole to the rescue, never save a ho
Hoes like to hide their behavior though
Thought you was a down ass bitch
'til I found that shit a couple days ago
I was home alone, next thing I know
That long ass verse from a song called "Control" was on
The room got nearer, the tune got clearer
That's when I seen the shit playing on your phone
Girl, what is that, a ringtone?
Shit, not you too
Man that hype done got you too
Everybody and their momma gassed
Even my momma asked what I'mma do
Decisions, decisions
In case this is war, then I load up on all ammunition
If a nigga want problems, my trigger's on auto
I'll make sure that nobody miss him
Now pack up your shit, you don't believe in me?
I don't need you, I got me, bitch
Same nigga moved to NYC, bitch
Got a record deal and a college degree, bitch
Two gold plaques, I produced all the tracks
And I never ever ever lean on Jay-Z, bitch
And after all that achievement
Real nigga never even went and got his teeth fixed
Now you try to play me, bitch?
You try to fuckin' play me? I ought to knock your ass out

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & (Timbaland)]
TKO, I don't understand it, tell me how could you be so low damn(take out)
You've been swingin' after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt, through my chest, perfect hit to the dome
Dammit babe
(Dammit babe, dammit babe, dammit babe, dammit babe)

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
All hail Pretty Flacko, bitch, celebrate it
Had the game on lock, streets serenaded
Now you lame mothafuckas lookin' devastated
Bet you niggas wish you never hated, that's the devil ain't it
Fuck that shit, he rich, fuck that shit, he this, fuck that shit, he that
He black, he don't like blacks, fuck that shit, he wack
Fuck that shit he raps, fuck that shit he spits, fuck that bitch
Fuck that bitch he with, finished talking shit? Get up off my dick
The nonsense is synonymous with comments from the blogs about
Menages with the gossips and the bosses, fuck surprises
I'm monogamous and not to mention, in my closet
Is a model chick, grimey gothic fits, trapped inside of it
Besides it I'd deny the shit shit, y'all should stop the shit
I'm the shit, not just kinda sick, the doc prescribed my shit
Cock it, click-click, opposite, stop and droppin' shit
'fore poppin' shit, from popular to poppin' picks to poppin' tits
She pop her pussy, pop a Xanny, popular for compliments
Make it rain, she pop that shit, it boosts her confidence
Was supposed to stop this shit but spit like I forgot some shit
Forgot the topic, I hope God forgive you, peep my common sense

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & (Timbaland)]
TKO, I don't understand it, tell me how could you be so low
You've been swingin' after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt, through my chest, perfect hit to the dome
Dammit babe
(Dammit babe, dammit babe, dammit babe, dammit babe)

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
JT this like deja vu right?
All this album of the year talk, niggas claimin' they're the best out
I been hot since the Purple Tape and this cuban's poking my chest out
They keep callin' on King Push, this beach chair, I'm stretched out
My name is my name, bitch, until I'm gone and it's etched out
I been known to blow a quarter brick on baby hairs and a messy bun
If I make her mine, I made her mind, she fall in line and we got some
Memoirs of a millionaire, even better I'm a reallionaire
Alaïa skirt, Fendi work, dress my baby like build-a-bear
Fuck you know about the type of rollie? Fuck you know about blowin' bands?
Bezel on it like a grand circle, diamonds in it, holdin' hands
A1 since day one, I sold dope and my name rung
I sold dope where I came from and it's so dope what I made from it
No lie, know why? Guy Fish in my bowtie
JT up in the three piece and we magic baby like showtime
She ain't know, we ain't know, try to trap her but she ain't slow
Once she trap you with the DA flow, it's lights out, TKO

[Verse 1: Robin Gibb]
Don't shed a tear for me
No, it's not your style
If you're not here by me
Then it's not worth while

[Chorus: Robin & Barry Gibb]
My world is our world
And this world is your world
And your world is my world
And my world is your world is mine

[Post-Chorus: Robin Gibb]
I've been crying, I'm lonely
What do I do to have you stay?
I've pleaded you to cry on
I've written to you nearly every day

[Chorus]
My world is our world
And this world is your world
And your world is my world
And my world is your world is mine

[Verse 1: Barry Gibb]
Don't shed a tear for me
No, that's not your style
If you're not here by me
Then it's not worth while

[Chorus]
My world is our world
And this world is your world
And your world is my world
And my world is your world is mine

[Post-Chorus]
I've been crying, I'm lonely
What do I do to have you stay?
I've pleaded you to cry on
I've written to you nearly every day

[Chorus]x3
My world is our world
And this world is your world
And your world is my world
And my world is your world is mine

[Verse 1]
I ain't got time
I only got a dime to make a last call
I'm gettin' soaking wet
And it ain't rained yet since last fall

[Hook]
I got myself a coach ticket on the Southern Railroad Line
I don't have to worry 'cause I know it never leaves on time

[Verse 2]
Late last night we made love and everything was all right
You walked out the door and the only thing I saw was the hall light

[Hook]

Why didn't you see that you don't feel the same way that I do
I understood before that you couldn't take much more as I knew

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Stranded in this spooky town
Stop lights are swaying and the phone lines are down
Floor is crackling cold
She took my heart, I think she took my soul
With the moon I run
Far from the carnage of the fiery sun

Driven by the strangle of vein
Showing no mercy, I'd do it again
Open up your eyes
You keep on crying, baby, I'll bleed you dry
Skies are blinking at me
I see a storm bubbling up from the sea

[Chorus]
And it's coming closer
And it's coming closer

[Verse 2]
You who shimmy shook my bone
Leaving me stranded all in love on my own
Do you think of me?
Where am I now? Baby, where do I sleep?
Feels so good, but I'm old
Two thousand years of chasing taking it's toll

[Chorus]
And it's coming closer
And it's coming closer
And it's coming closer
And it's coming closer

[Verse 1]
Oh baby
Oh man
You're making me crazy
Really driving me mad
That's alright with me
It's really no fuss
As long as you're next to me
Just the two of us

[Chorus]
You're my, my, my, my kind of woman
My, oh my, what a girl
You're my, my, my, my kind of woman
And I'm down on my hands and knees
Begging you please, baby
Show me your world

[Verse 2]
Oh brother
Sweetheart
I'm feeling so tired
Really falling apart
And it just don't make sense to me
I really don't know
Why you stick right next to me
Wherever I go

[Chorus]
You're my, my, my, my kind of woman
My, oh my, what a girl
You're my, my, my, my kind of woman
And I'm down on my hands and knees
Begging you please, baby
Show me your world

[Verse 1]
I wish the world was run by all the little children
We could be happy once again
We won't hurt when we're like little children
And we won't ever feel the pain

[Verse 2]
Now when my fight for life on earth is over
And I leave 'cause I can't stay
All my love belongs to you hereafter
And we'll all join hands another day

[Chorus]
Everybody's got to give a hand
Everybody's got to take a hand
Everybody's got to fall in love, yeah
To make everybody understand
Everybody's got to give, take a hand

[Verse 3]
I love you, yes, I do, I told you a million times now
Now, do you believe the words I say?
All my life belongs to you hereafter
And we'll all join hands another day

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
I was lost in your love
I was held by your heart
And no secrets
Stood between us anymore
I'm like a child, learning pain
I was held by your chains
And my darling
I was lost in your love

[Verse 1]
There's been a difference of opinion
To the way I've been treating you
But you know that I've tried to apologize
For all the bad times I've put you through
On the chance that I could make you mine
There's not a thing I would not do
And wrong or right I'll be with you
And lost in your love

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Now I will follow you where the wild bird flies
Through endless skies I will go
So I can be so near you girl
And all of this you gotta know
That when I get you
Here inside my arms
I never ever ever will let you go
And wrong or right I'll be with you
And lost in your love

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Lost in your love yes
And you made love feels so
I was lost in your love babe
But you made love feel sacred
You made me feel sacred
Oh you made me feel sacred
You make love sacred
You make me feel so
And I and I gotta tell you
And I gotta tell you
You are making me yourself oh yeah
Oh yeah, you make me feel so good
Ah you make you make me feel so good
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Give me some
Give me some more
Oh you make me feel so good

[Verse 1]
Do you love me women, truly do ya?
Can you feel this feeling going through ya?
Are you of the mind that we should live together through this night?
Or tell me you're my virgin queen and it may not be right

[Chorus]
But don't make me say
I can't let you go and it's breaking me down
Just thinking of your face
And it won't be around
Just look at me now
I feel a stranger inside
Stealing my pride
I can't let you go
And it's breaking me down
'cause you won't be around

[Verse 2]
When all this world of ours is falling apart
I'll keep on hanging on and fixing my heart
'Cause everyone is just like me
They're praying in the sun
And I may be that lucky man surviving when they're gone

[Chorus]

Just look at me now
I feel a stranger inside
Stealing my pride
I can't let you
Can't let you go
And it's breaking my down
'cause you won't be around

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Just look at me now, I can't let you go
Just look at me now, I can't let you go
Just look at me now, I can't let you go
Just look at me now, I can't let you go

[Verse 1]
I wander lonely as a cloud
I keep my head above the crowd
Ain't nobody else as big as me
But I must remember friends
What has to start just has to end
Everybody's got a destiny

[Chorus]
And I know when the swallows flies
Yes I know, and the earth just dies
Then I'll be told what I am
The swallow and me

[Verse 2]
I'll look after number one
I'll forget the beggar's son
Everybody's got to stay alive
I'll keep a-walking amongst the clouds
I'll keep my head above the crowd
I'll watch them live, I'll watch them die

[Chorus]

[Outro]
And I know when the swallows flies
Yes I know, and the earth just dies
Yes I know when the swallow flies
Yes I know, and the earth just dies
Wouldn't wake up this morning
Believe me
This might be your only warning
And you'll see
Why the rules won't slide
For seeing something bright
But darker and darker they get
As my clothes don't sweat
And start to weep
As we sleep

And everything hits you in the end
And spoils your thought stream
My heart got a hold of my head
And ripped it to its seams
My confessions seem well bled
But resolutions are only dreams
And now I'm covered in blood
On the bed
And it's a familiar scene
Cause I'm pretty sure my mind ran down this line again
Only last week

[Verse 1]
Mother, see you in the may when I'm a boy
Believer - monologue exemplifies a lust
It's true

[Verse 2]
Funny how it only seems to work at night
Jeweler, pick me something pretty for my wife
So true
So true

[Verse 1]
Mother, see you in the may when I'm a boy
Believer - monologue exemplifies a lust
It's so true
So true

[Outro]
It's so true
It's so true
It's so true
Oh oh, it's so true
It's so true
Oh oh, it's so true
It's so true

[Verse 1]
Baby love, would you like to be my little girl for life?
Take you on a cruise in my sweet Cadillac
Promised your papa to bring you home by nine
His watch, not mine
Oh my babe, it makes me oh-so happy just to hear my name
Rumors in my school hall leave me so ashamed
I want to be just like the other girls tonight
Just for tonight

[Verse 2]
Are you cold?
Take my leather jacket as I turn this on
The fleetwoods serenade you into my sweet arms
Never seemed to care about most other girls
You're not other girls
Oh, my babe
Whiskeytown is ours, just for tonight
So please
Forget everything that my daddy said to me
I know it's not your fault, and I'm not to blame
Just say my name

[Verse 1]
Oh, I was a lonely girl
I grew up fast
I took my Tahoe to go somewhere where the boys lust
I turned my phone off, I sold my laptop
And then I took right off to the west

[Chorus]
Give me spring and sun, sleeping on the run
Bed is my backseat, twinkles what I eat
Mother made my dress full of my distress
Guess I'll miss the dance, ruined every chance

[Verse 2]
You know I was the queen
I kept my record clean
Approaching Whistletown
And reaching higher ground
I'm keeping grains of sand
I moisturize my hands
In case I need to do another shoot

[Chorus]
Give me spring and sun, sleeping on the run
Bed is my backseat, twinkles what I eat
Mother made my dress full of my distress
Guess I'll miss the dance, ruined every chance

[Verse 1]
Oh, I was a lonely girl
I grew up fast
I took my Tahoe to go somewhere where the boys lust
I turned my phone off, I sold my laptop
Then I took right off to the west

[Chorus]
Give me spring and sun, sleeping on the run
Bed is my backseat, twinkles what I eat
Mother made my dress full of my distress
Guess I'll miss the dance, ruined every chance

[Refrain]
As you see, I'm not alone
We were left inside this hole
Set the sun an open session of me
In the west
Losing all my friends for sure
We were left inside this hole
Nevermind, I'm done
That's enough of me out there

[Refrain]
As you see, I'm not alone
We were left inside this hole
Set the sun an open session of me
In the west
Losing all my friends for sure
We were left inside this hole
Nevermind, I'm done
That's enough of me out there

[Verse 1]
Step out the van and put your clothes on
Out of my sight, a love termite
I know I talk a smooth sweet d'argent
No, Pistol Pete, make you complete
So I sang

[Verse 2]
You talk so much, it makes me nervous
Shut your pretty face and stay in your place
Where is my beer? Where is my blanket?
Where is my faith? Deep in your face

[Verse 1]
I just can't believe all the things people say
Controversy
Am I black or white? Am I straight or gay?
Controversy
Do I believe in God? Do I believe in me?
Yeah, uh, uh, controversy
Controversy
Controversy
I can't understand human curiosity
Controversy

Dear Fans

I haven't sat down to write you guys in SUCH a long time.  Long overdue!  We're all so used to getting our thoughts out in 140 characters, but sometimes its nice to take time to sit down and write something a little longer and more personal.  I am putting the finishing touches on my new album, Britney Jean over the next few days and I am so excited for you to hear it.  I poured my heart and soul into this album and it's been an incredible journey.  I've learned a lot about myself, and as I am finishing, I am reminded of the incredible foundation that has supported me for the last 15 years.  Thank you all for continuing to follow me on this journey and for allowing me to do what I love to do.  I can’t believe this is my eighth studio album and I know I keep telling you that it is my most personal record yet, but its true and I’m really proud of that

I have been through a lot in the past few years and it has really inspired me to dig deeper and write songs that I think everyone can relate to.  Working with people like Sia, William Orbit, and of course Will.i.am has been an amazing experience.  They have listened to all of my ideas and helped me bring them to life.  There are a lot of really fun, upbeat dance songs, but it was important to me that I show my strength, and my attitude, and my vulnerability.  Of course, I also have some surprises for you guys ;)

I want to show you the different sides of Britney Spears.  I am a performer.  I am a Mom.  I am funny.  I am your friend!  I am Britney Jean

Hope you love my labor of love!

Love Always
Britney

[Verse 1]
Spastic gyrations
And abbreviated bathing suits
See I suit you
Cause I could be you
And I could show you true
Till the cold runs through and through
A portrayal in black and blue

[Chorus]
I'm not painting this lie anymore
Since it was all I had to adore of you
And all I had to say
Girl you keep running away

[Verse 2]
Well time never gave me a chance
I shoulda been there
Well you laid me bare
Took my soul to wear
Left a hole to despair
See what I'm going through
You never even knew
That's nothing on my plate
Trapped in a lizard state
My mind's at the gate
Looking for an escape

[Chorus]
I'm not painting this lie anymore
Since it was all I had to adore of you
And all I had to say
Girl I'm not painting this lie any more
I'm not painting this lie anymore
Since it was all I had to adore of you
And all I had to say
Girl it never hit me the same boy...
I know I
Live a life that won't change
For some time
I've felt, well, quite strange
I haven't cried for a year
I don't prize myself for my ill health
That starts to loom

An empty room
Is now my doom

My past has gone
Well I know this was not what I wanted
My head was clear not in fear of habit
And guilt never took control
Well I lost a soul to my blues
A long time ago

A long time ago

[Intro]
You are the light of my beautiful life
You are the light of my beautiful life

[Verse 1]
You know I wake up and every day
I feel safe knowing that you got my back now and forever
Live in my life cause I've got nothing to do
When a tear falls
You put your hands out, you catch my tears
And I'm feeling so close to your love now
If I was lost out now I am found

[Pre-Chorus]
I lift my hands and pray cause life is tough somedays
But I will not lose faith, 'cause you will lead the way

[Chorus]
You're my light when it gets dark
You're always in my heart
You're my brightest morning star
You're my light when it gets dark
You're always in my heart
You're my brightest morning star

[Post-Chorus]
You are the light of my beautiful life
I can never let go, you're my brightest morning star
You are the light of my beautiful life
I can never let go, you're my brightest morning star

[Verse 2]
In your arms I, I feel alive, I am not afraid
I will keep you, listen closely
I look for signs everyday

[Pre-Chorus]
I lift my hands and pray 'cause life is tough somedays
But I will not lose faith 'cause you will lead the way

[Chorus]
You're my light when it gets dark
You're always in my heart
You're my brightest morning star
You're my light when it gets dark
You're always in my heart
You're my brightest morning star
You're my light when it gets dark
You're always in my heart
You're my brightest morning star
You're my light when it gets dark
You're always in my heart
You're my brightest morning star

[Outro]
You are the light of my beautiful life
You are the light of my beautiful life
How many of you people came here with someone you love tonight. If you love somebody tonight, hold on real tight. Hold on, hold on. If you love somebody tonight, hold on real tight. If you love somebody tonight, hold on, hold on. Hold on tonight

Tonight I was thinking about being as safe as possible, I don't want to say nothing politically incorrect. 

[???] A very safe musician. I've been thinking about it. I've been thinking about going backstage and not saying nothing at all, is that cool? Uhh, before I go back there I got to ask you one question. Just one real quick. Just one. CAN I TALK MY SHIT AGAIN? CAN I TALK MY SHIT AGAIN? Can I talk my shit? Can I talk my shit? It's like I always find, I always find, I always find something wrong. Cause I've been putting up with they shit just way too long. I'm so gifted at finding what they don't like the most. So if they find that they don't like the most

You know, it's so interesting cause they're trying to make me, like you just read the, Don't me ask about the motherfucking mask, you know what it comes off of. 

[?]. It's the Yeezus shit. You know when you, if you read the headlines and read like, random blogs or whatever the fuck they might put up, you know, it's funny how they, they always try to bring up the negative or, bring up the things that sound the most out of context. You know it's like, have you ever felt out of place ever, like, out of context like someone just didn't understand, like they just didn't understand what you wanted to do, what you was trying to do, or what, or what you was dreaming of. Have you ever, have you ever been scared to say, to say your dreams out loud? Have you ever been just a little bit afraid to say your dreams out loud? Have you been afraid to dream in front of a crowd, to dream in front of a crowd, to dream in front of a crowd, to dream out loud?

I had a dream. I had a dream that I was Steve Jobs. I had a dream that I was Walt Disney. I had a dream that I was The Wright Brothers. I had a dream that I was Thomas Edison. I had a dream that I was Mandela. I had a dream that I was Martin Luther King. I had a dream, I had a dream, I had a dream. I had a dream, I had a dream. And I'm not afraid to dream out loud. You know you just get so scared that people are gonna think you're crazy, or that you're stupid, or that you're foolish, or this is the time that everybody thinks you're losing your mind, but I'm not losing my mind, I'm using my mind! I'm not losing my mind, I'm using my mind. So don't mind me, don't mind me, don't mind me. I'm not losing, I'm not losing my mind, I'm using my mind. So don't mind me, nevermind me, never, never, nevermind me. If what I'm saying, appeals to you, and makes you feel like you can be a better you, than thats good for me. And if what I'm saying offends you, and makes you feel like the worst you, than that's good for me too, true. That's good for me too, true. That's good for me too, true

Cause there's only two types of people, there's dreamers and there's haters. There's dreamers and there's haters. And all I've been doing recently is cutting the grass real low. So if you a dreamer, everybody will know. And if you a hater, make yourself be seen, CAUSE I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT YOU, THATS WHAT I MEAN! Cut the grass real low, cut the grass real low, cut the grass real low. 

[?] I find 

[?], cause I feel like I just try sometimes. And I'm not afraid at all. I'm not afraid to fall. I'm not afraid to fall. I'm not afraid to fall. I'm not afraid at all. I'm not afraid at all. THEY CAN'T STAND ME! THEY CAN'T CONTROL ME! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME!!! THEY CAN'T HOLD ME!

I ain't saying, when I say you I'm talking about public perception, I'm talking about backlash, I'm talking about all the tools they use to hold dreamers back, to make them look like motherfucking lunatics. How many people you know, that you talk to on a day to day basis, that made a motherfucking mountain open up in Tampa tonight? So all the other shit I'm talking about, is it crazy or is it possible? Put your hands up if you think anything is possible. Put your hands up if you think anything is possible, if you think anything is possible, if you think anything is possible. Cause God made us in his image. And God made us all artists as children, God made us all artists as children. And somehow that peer pressure takes the artist out of you. Somehow the world can leave you so 

[?] confused, and you forget who you are. But I'm remembering, I'm remembering, I'm remembering

Cause most people, you know they say, they say people in my position, what ever that position is, like a celebrity or you make money, you have some type of status or some shit, you don't wanna fuck it up right? You don't wanna ruin your name, you don't wanna say anything wrong. So what you do is you get on TV you just smile, you just wave, and you try to be as safe as possible, cause you don't wanna fuck up enough, BUT I WANNA FUCK EVERYTHING UP!!! I WANNA FUCK EVERYTHING UP! I WANNA FUCK UP AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE 'CAUSE I'm STILL BEATING! As long as my heart is beating, as long as I'm dreaming. And I'mma stay kicking and dreaming, kicking and screaming, kicking and dreaming

I feel like it's my responsibility to turn up. I feel like it's my responsibility to turn up. And I stand here, the Gemini that I am, and there are so many examples throughout our history: Miles Davis, Biggie Smalls, Lauryn Hill, Prince, 2Pac. The Gemini that I am, it is my responsibility to turn up and tell you the truth. And if I get in so much trouble for telling you the truth, and if I, if I get in so much trouble for telling you the truth, then the rest of the time, the rest of the time, what the fuck were they telling you? If I get in so much trouble for telling you the truth, then the rest of the time, what the FUCK were they telling you?!? What the fuck are they telling you? So don't let nobody kill your dreams, don't let nobody tell you what you can do. Cause the more you accomplish, the more they wanna say you look like a fool. Following what you want to tonight, and you gotta an opportunity in the world

How many people are under 20 tonight? How many people are under 30 tonight? Under 40, under 50, under 60, GOD DAMMIT YOU ALIVE, YOU ALIVE, YOU ALIVE, YOU ALIVE, YOU ALIVE, YOU ARE LIVING, YOU ARE BREATHING, SO 

[??] YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY IN THIS WORLD!!!

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]

All this Burberry clothing got your girlfriend nervous

Got 10 shooters with me like the secret damn service
And I pitch that dope, I pitch that dope, my bitch so curvy
They call me ?? how I microwave work it
In that thang and it's dirty when it's clean, when it's clean
Got a green and some lean, when she jump out it's a dream
Yella yachtmaster on me, I'm eating some lemon pepper wings
And I don't ever turn down, think this shit a game?

[Hook x 2]

[Intro]
Yo, I ain't seen you in a minute
But I got something to tell you
Listen

[Verse 1]
See, the thing about you that caught my eye
Is the same thing that makes me change my mind
Kind of hard to explain, but girl, I'll try
You need to sit down, this may take a while
See this girl, she sort of looks just like you
She even smiles just the way you do
So innocent she seemed, but I was fooled
I'm reminded when I look at you

[Chorus]
You remind me of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you

[Verse 2]
Thought that she was the one for me
Til I found out she was on her creep
Ooh, she was sexing everyone, but me
This is why we could never be

[Chorus]
You remind me of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you

[Bridge]
I know it's so unfair to you (it's so unfair)
That I relate her ignorance to you
Wish I knew
Wish I knew how to separate the two
You remind me (you remind me)

[Chorus]
Whoa whoa oh oh oh oh
You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you, (gotta let you go)
You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through (all the shit she put me through)
This is why I just can't get with you, no no
You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you
You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you
You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You won't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you

[Outro]
You remind me of a girl that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
Wouldn't believe all of the things she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you

Don't leave your girl around me, true playa for real
Ask my nigga, Pharrell, uh

In our lives
But you got to be smart about it
Celebrations with the guys

'Cause I'ma be alright tonight

[Verse 2]
Aw, girl, your face is saying, "Why?"
Tears in eyes
Should've been more smart about it
Should've cherished me, listening to friends
Now it's the end
And again, no story can end without it

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Damn right...
I loved you
You were my girl
You see, I...
Thought the world of you
But you're still steady leaving, baby

[Chorus]

And just chill, we ain't gotta wild out, just chill

Sipping on chardonnay, slip on that Vicki Secret lingerie
'Cause I ain't trying to throw my money away (in the streets)
If I can see you twork it out for me

[Chorus]
Tworkin' it out, laying in the cut
Kissing, rubbing, and making sweet love
Damn the club tonight, let's twork it out

Won't stop until you scream my name

[Chorus]
Tworkin' it out, laying in the cut
Kissing, rubbing, and making sweet love
Damn the club tonight, let's twork it out

[Verse 1]
You never know the weight of your crimes
But when all the gates have closed and you're tired
You stand a while by the fire and it burns bright
A while, a while; you sit quiet

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Inside, you're so warm
Your eyes open up
To the sunrise, to the sunrise
Far from here

[Verse 2]
I never know the state that you're in
Oh, it's obvious to climb in your skin
But I know I will walk across
When inside, inside, it feels right

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Inside, you're so warm
Your eyes open up
To the sunrise, to the sunrise

[Chorus]
'Cause I want you to know that I don't
'Cause I want you to know that I don't
'Cause I want you to know that I don't
'Cause I want you to know that I don't

[Outro]
(God made Man and his reason)
'Cause I want you to know that I don't (God made Man and his reason)
'Cause I want you to know that I don't (God made Man and his reason)

And I want you to know...

Hundred bottles in the club, now I'm showin' out
Imma shine on 'em, I'mma grind on 'em
Take a shot, turn up, and go dumb on 'em

Flash money at the haters, that's a gun on 'em
Got Picasso on the wall, I spend that

Y'all just gettin' rich, I been that

[Hook: R Kelly]

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
You know I fuck with them bitches that like to fuck with them bitches
I heard you fuck with them niggas that like to fuck with them snitches
What you got in your pockets, I see you holdin' them figures
I hope you don't blow it all cause that would just be ridiculous
Think I'm addicted to ballin', think I'm addicted to cash
If we leave here tonight, girl I murder that ass
Don't be all in my section if you ain't talkin' 'bout fuckin'
We ain't talkin' 'bout fuckin' then we ain't talkin' bout nothin'
See I came with my niggas, we came to fuck up a chick
This some real shit to give, you better show some respect
My two-door's exotic, I blow my money with style
I got some young niggas from my turf with me, they're wild
I got some bitches with ass, I got some bitches with class
Got a bitch right now, west side, hold the stash
If the windows are tinted, a quarter milli' a minute
Ain't leavin' shit in my pockets because I came here to spend it

[Hook: R Kelly]

[Verse 3: R Kelly]
This your birthday, girl, I'mma spend that
Cake, cake, cake, cake, get up in that
You set the bar so high they can't top that
Them other chicks ain't on your level, tell 'em "stop that"
Black panties on, girl drop that
Look back at me, like I own that
Best pussy in the club and she know that
I make it rain so much, you gotta mop that
Moët (bitty bottles), pop that (what?)
It's a celebration, girl, gon' toast that
(Throw that money, spend that dough)
(Make it twerk, on that pole)

[Hook: R Kelly]

[Verse 1]
Girl I'm ready if you're ready now
Oh, as I'm ever gonna be
If you're with it then I'm with it now
To accept all responsibility

[Pre-Chorus]
I go out of my way to live by the words that you say
I don't wanna be the same, oh

[Chorus]
Maybe you could change me
Maybe you could change me, woah
Maybe you could be the light that opens up my eyes
Make all my wrongs right, change me, change me

[Verse 2]
Don't fight fire with fire
If I'm screaming, talk quieter
Understanding and patience
Feel the pain that I'm facing

[Pre-Chorus]
Be like serenity, help reposition my mind
Take a chance make a difference, in my life

[Chorus]
Maybe you could change me
Maybe you could change me, woah
Maybe you could be the light that opens up my eyes
Make all my wrongs right, change me, change me

[Outro]
Girl I'm ready if you're ready now
Oh, as I'm ever gonna be
If you're with it then I'm with it now

[Intro: Lil Snupe]
Why she worryin' bout my next bitch
Steady going on my Facebook
Tryna see how my bitch face look

[Louie V Gutta]
I said that old bitch she a groupie doe
We 'bout to make a movie ho
I take my new bitch to the mall
Me and my new bitch yeah we ball
Said we be all up in Neimans and shit
I be on the cleanest of shit
Hol' on, ion really freestyle
But nigga in the meanwhile
I got ya bitch in my coupe, me and Lil Snupe
'Bout to party ya bitch, show her what to do
'Bout to take her to the telly she gon' get it crackin'
That nigga standin' there he like what happened?

[Lil Snupe & Louie V Gutta]
Huh
Motel, hell nah bitch you better meet me at the hotel
But we ain't talkin' Cassidy
We fuck ya bitch and it's a tragedy

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]

My man said he gotta get up in that halfway house
So that mean he halfway in and halfway out
Halfway in and halfway out
We get the work halfway in and halfway out
What you know about 36 ridin' with a dirty brick
You had to call a ho a lil dirty bitch
Just take the ride, so when they pull you over
You got a bitch with you, you still acting sober
But you high as fuck cause you just smoked a L
And if this nigga play wrong we ain't goin' to jail
Motherfucker, ya'll niggas rats, show and tell
Cause if the cops grab ya'll, ya'll gon' show and tell
Show 'em where the stash at, where the cash at
I get a bitch ho show me where that ass at
And last time i seen the work, nigga grabbed that
Then I bagged that nigga, had that
What you know about a scale nigga?
Glock '30, giving everybody hell nigga
I did that banger, all in jail nigga
Hit you up and have you movin' like a snail nigga
Slow motion, sippin' on purp potion
I'm gettin money everybody, they know it
I be Roseing, chosen
A millionaire they say I'm chosen
Cause I came from the bottom, they told me get 'em I got 'em
Red beam on 'em, they moving you know I spot 'em
Hit 'em in the dark nigga fucking with the larks
Playin' round you get parked, 106 when I spark
On this drum clip, young nigga but I run shit
And you stupid as a dumb bitch
I make a dumb bitch give me head, let you know where I'm from bitch
The 8, posted by the gate
Before i ain't had money, I was straight
Ion fuck with none of ya'll rappers, I can't relate
All that shit you talking that nigga, it ain't
I used to play that fuckin' corner, paranoid getting high off the marijuana
Everytime i seen the cops sneak up in the corner
It was tinted cars I felt like I was a goner
I was out there all night, BR had that hard white and that soft white
Me and Omelly in the car, on call flight
Tryna swing that work nigga, this is our life
We bring that work to your door nigga (uh knock knock)
Strapped down, .44 nigga (pop pop)
Crack life but we on tour nigga, mac life let that thing roar nigga
I seen niggas go to early graves
For tryna play with hammers in they early days
A lotta niggas on ho shit, got girly ways
I fall back I got nah, got pearly waves
My shit flowin', and I'mma keep on goin'
And I'mma get this money, everybody they be knowin'
That I came from the bottom and I made it to the top
And I started with a '22, I made it to a Glock
Then I stepped up to the mac, then I went and copped a bat
'Member started with the 'lac, back then remember that?
We was getting chased by the rock
He caught his own ? down on snub block
He got booked with an ounce of crack, shit was rock
They tried to take that nigga in, we hold up shit to stop, put it in the car
They couldn't even find the O nigga, it was hard
He put that thing behind the badge, shit it was soft
He couldn't find it, had to rewind us
We all got booked with the lil' pair of Irons
Let me bring it back and remind it
The same block I got pulled on when they found us
Put me in the cell, we was comin' a scooby
We had a lil sprinter, we ain't come in a hoopty
He come down I told my niggas, "mm mm"
I put a hole in ya head, I ain't talking no coofy nigga
I Rich Blade,  talking no Coogi nigga
I slip you one, ain't talking no Roofy nigga
You playin' round nigga we gon' gun ya down
Walk up on you, if you running we gon' run ya down
My young niggas gettin' money, we don't fuck around
All ya;ll niggas on your team, ya'll fuckin' clowns
It's all real niggas, we don't rob we kill niggas
We treat 'em like, ya'll niggas pump fake and fire drill niggas
Sins will swallow explicit
Kinks of hollow mystic
That sit deep in a limp twitch
Turns a pale tanner
Handspan a hammer
Consults a cold manner
That lies deep in the grammar

Mono inner collision
Born to mid decision
Born bare invision
Just to master a sigh
They found reasons to try
Clone the sea at night
Brave waves bathe the eye
Well I crave ways to dry

Well I was raised to the moon
Just to hold a gaze with you
Cross the other side
It won’t be long till you’re inside
Till you’re inside my heart
*murmurs*
Used heat cooling
Steady steeps falling
Brain keeps stooping to avoid
Thoughts of matter
Pristine platter replicates the flatter of a nervous crane
Some won’t understand and it my deplete a man
By seeping through the cracks of bland

They found reasons to try
Clone the sea at night
Brave waves bathe the eye
Well I crave ways to dry

See I was raised to the moon
Just to hold a gaze with a view
Across the other side
It won’t be long till you’re inside
Till you’re inside my heart
Till you’re inside
Till you’re inside my heart
To be with you, such a view
To be elevated to you
To be elevated to you

[Verse 1]
It’s dinnertime baby. Girl
What you spent on that outfit, damn right. Girl turn around
You make a real nigga so hard
Turnt up is an understatement, bout to get real foul and flagrant
On rock and I’m  hard as pavements
Bet you gon’ take all of this tonight (take all of this tonight)

Do a little dance for me, no Red Nose but she shaking

[Verse 2]

Putting in work I’m in shape, stroking making them legs shake
Big round booty make it earth quake bet you gon’ take all of me tonight
Show me you need
These inches in your life
She do a little dance for me, no Red Nose but she shaking
She ain’t gotta have no money put that ass on and she caking
And the best part about it, them high heels and that necklace is the only thing that you keeping on
Now that we’re body to body, no crushed and we sexing
I wanna see you in rare form

[Hook]

[Bridge]

Lights on and them clothes off, ass up and its going down
Baby leave them lights on and I’mma fuck your fucking brains out

[Outro]
Fucking with the lights on. Fucking with the lights on

And girl we’ll be, Fucking with the lights on
Fucking with the lights on. Fucking with them on
We’ll be fucking with the lights on, baby girl
So don’t touch the switch just come and get the dick
Fucking with the lights on

Dinner time

[November 30, 2013:]
Chapter One: Grits

Two more smacks should do it. She's weak. A couple more properly placed palms across the cheeks and she'll be all his.

She'll make good money for him too. Thick-legged, creole, tall...yeah she's a real winner. I give her two months. I give him three.

Two months before she wises up and figures out she'll be here forever and three months before she puts a knife in his chest for it.

That's Neo-Harlem for you. That slow burn then that inferno. And you either wood or fire...ain't no water just Gin to keep it goin.

Two slick punks gambling they heart out next to the scene. Couple cops shaking down some junky next to that. That's the view from the office

.45 on the desk. Digital cigar burning. Sun-Ra coming out the speakers. Antique Rick Ross poster on the wall. Man I miss hip-hop. Damn shame

Mental telephone on vibrate. Mostly getting lost dog calls these days. 10 million worth of Units in the wall safe. Nano-Eames couch for now.

Could really use some pussy. Real pussy not that robotic Kevlar jellyfish these ladies walking around with today. Fake pussy fake furniture.

CHANEL VAGINAL IMPLANTS: Who Says Sex Can't Be Luxurious"
"Coach Vaginal Implants: The Next Level"

"NIKE Sport Implants: Just Do It"

The Sun-Ra reaches its crescendo just as I get a call worth answering. ---1 Million Units!!! Respond For Details--- Money first. I like that

POW! POW! The cops shot the junky. Streets gonna be alive tonight. Real alive.
I put on my jacket & head for the diner. I need some grits.

Join us next time for Chapter 2 of "TERIYAKI JOE: NEO-HARLEM DETECTIVE"

A WOLFStudio Production.

[November 30, 2013:]
Teriyaki Joe: Neo-Harlem Detective Chapter 2: Coffee

"You're Not Real Joe" God Damn hackers! They got into my MindPhone somehow.

They keep leaving these messages. Nobody is coming to get this junky. All his body parts are expired probably why he was getting doped up.

Two years ago he'd of been stripped clean before he hit the ground. But now designers parts are so easy to come by he's good as gum wrappers

Don't know why they shot him though. Cops these days. You never know. Disposal might come in a couple weeks. Might not.

Valentines Day. Hookers working overtime. Flower shop empty. Whole city in love with something or atleast pretending to be.

I step into the diner and work my way through the crowd waiting on tables to steal a seat at the counter. It's always a seat there.

5 coffees, 3 grits, 6 eggs, 2 toasts, 9 sausage. She hands over the glasses. I inform her these are dirty. She doesn't care.

I wipe them on my jacket and put them on. 5 blinks equal 25 Units. She slides me the black tray with the pills and sneers out "Bon Apetite"

Units are stored in the eyes. Blinking releases Units into receiving glasses or goggles or contacts and your purchase is complete.
They updated the toast. Coffee is still terrible. I spot Tall Creole at the end of the counter popping back Gin pills raw. A reality freak.

I look back down with my eyes half over the top of the glasses & see the black tray in the glasses I see a plate overflowing with breakfast.

I like to stay one foot in & one foot out I guess. I can take being lied to. Being a liar comes easy too. Here its an expectation of sorts.

The human body still isn't used to digesting pill food properly. Updating is a constant to combat the side effects. Shakes, vomiting etc.

Better than real food though. That shit will kill you. So many additives and molecular advertising in it it's damn near plastic.

Tall Creole shakes violently, damn near falls off stool. She's almost ready 4 the night to take her. I hope she makes it out the other side.

I grab the Shake Handles connected to the stool and prepare for my turn. It comes. I wink a tip. Take off the glasses & head into the nite.

---1 Million Units Respond For Details--- glows in the left hand corner of my mind. I've been thinking about it this whole time.

Sounds like a set up to be honest. 1 Millions Units is the apple but who is the devil on the other side. I guess that makes me Adam. No Eve!

"Playback Tall Creole" half my mind rewinds back to my thick-legged tail as she followed me into the diner recording me as I recorded her.

Now we have our Eve, Adam & The Apple. Now we just need The Devil. Sometimes the best place to find the devil is in the mirror. Lets see.

---This is Teriyaki Joe...What Are The Details??---

*...END OF CHAPTER 2...*

[December 2, 2013:]
Teriyaki Joe: Neo-Harlem Detective

Chapter 3: Gravy

---Download Complete--- Hmmm looks like I'll be heading upstairs.

The cab stinks. The stale intensity of so many burned out digital cigar cores left to decay on the floor. The acid graffiti. It doesn't fit.

Not fit transport for somebody "Going Upstairs" as they say. We all say that. Some champagne and classical music would be nice.

Maybe a chauffeur would give the trip up top a fancier sentiment. I mean the best of us should travel with a little more class and dignity.

This is like being in a port-o-potty with thrusters. A couple coughs. A well aimed spit. Yeah thats how the "Best Of Us" do it, precisely.

Up through the clouds. Directly into the Moon. We pass through it. It's only a meter thick. So warm. So fake. Color is still wrong to me.

The cab slows to a halt. Border patrol scans the ID tags. All clear. One step down. Disinfection nozzles spray the cab down. Missed a spot.

Step three is up next. Blindness. Total sensory disconnect. 3 seconds. 3 weeks. It's all the same in "non-sense." Helpless. Out of touch.
"EOJ LAER TON RUOY" --------- *digital sizzle"

----------------------—•----------------------------------------------------music-------------------------------------------------------

---------------!!! Awww Nice. Grass. Glass. Nothing else. Central Fucking Park Baby! It's all tai-chi and vegan techno utopia. Upstairs.

NH is Downstairs. Can't see it from here. Shit I wouldn't wanna see it either. Most these folks never have. Never will. Where's my devil?

Birthing out of Non-sense mode is always a mellow moment. Has to be or the shock would give you a heart attack. Wish I could smoke here.

Man would you look at that. The real Sun. Son of a bitch. My devil approaches. His name is 11. Mid level manager at a pill manufacturer.

I don't believe him. He's not my devil. Too many questions. He's just checking me out. He knows I know. He changes to his real voice.

All this espionage. Games. The real voice isn't really right either. Neither are the eyes. All tests. The "air" is thick with nano-machines

It's like wading in a pool of thin water. It's what moves things here. A seamless, all encompassing soup of nano-machines & information.

A spoonful of this stuff would sell for millions back Downstairs if we had real sunlight to keep it alive that is. What'd he say???!!!

"That's right Mr.Teriyaki (-It's Joe!-) I want you to bring my daughter back."

Impossible.

[Verse 1]
Two feets, they come a creepin'
Like a black cat do
And two bodies are layin' naked
A creeper think he got nothin' to lose

[Pre-Chorus]
So he creeps into this house, yeah
And unlocks the door
An' as the man's reaching for his trousers
He shoots him full of 38 holes

[Chorus]
Mister Saturday Night Special
Got a barrel that's blue and cold
It ain't good for nothing but puttin' men six feet in a hole

[Verse 2]
Big Jim's been drinking whiskey
And playing poker on a losing night
An' pretty soon, Ol' Jim starts a-thinkin'
Somebody been cheatin' and lyin'
So Big Jim commence to fighting
I wouldn't tell you no lie
Big Jim done pulled his pistol
Shot his friend right between the eyes

[Chorus]
Mister Saturday Night Special
Got a barrel that's blue and cold
It ain't good for nothing but puttin' men six feet in a hole

[Bridge]
Hmm, and that's the Saturday Night Special
For twenty dollars, you can buy yourself one, too

Here it come

[Guitar Solo]

Oh, lemme tell you all about it

[Verse 3]
Hand guns are made for killing
They ain't no good for nothing else
And if you like to drink your whiskey
You might even shoot yourself

[Pre-Chorus]
So why don't we dump 'em, people, to the bottom of the sea?
Before some old fool come around here
Wanna shoot either you, or me

[Chorus]
Mister Saturday Night Special
You got a barrel that's blue and cold
You ain't good for nothing but puttin' men six feet in a hole

[Outro]
It's a Saturday Night Special
And I'd like to tell you what you can do with it, too
And that's the end of this song

[Verse 1]
When I signed my deal, I felt pressure
Don't want to see the numbers, I want to see heaven
You say could you write a song for me?
I say I'm sorry I won't do that happily

[Pre-Chorus]
When I go home, I tend to close the door
I never wanted more, so sing with me, can't you see?

[Chorus]
I don't have money on my mind
Money on my mind
I do it for, I do it for the love
I don't have money on my mind
Money on my mind
I do it for, I do it for the love

[Post-Chorus]
I do it for the love
I do it for the love

[Verse 2]
Please don't get me wrong, I wanna keep it moving
I know what that requires, I'm not foolish
Please can you, make this work for me?
'Cause I am not a puppet, I will work against your strings

[Pre-Chorus]
When I go home, I tend to close the door
I never wanted more, so sing with me, can't you see?

[Chorus]
I don't have money on my mind
Money on my mind
I do it for, I do it for the love
I don't have money on my mind
Money on my mind
I do it for, I do it for the love

[Post-Chorus]
I do it for the love
I do it for the love

[Bridge]
When the sun will set
Don't you fret
No, I have no money on my mind
No money on my mind
No money on my mind
No, I have no money on my mind
When the sun will set
Don't you fret
No, I have no money on my mind
No money on my mind
No money on my mind
No, I have no money on my mind
Just love

[Chorus]
Money on my mind
Money on my mind
I do it for, I do it for the love
I don't have money on my mind
Money on my mind
I do it for, I do it for the love

[Post-Chorus]
I do it for the love
I do it for the love

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse]
Slide, baby, I'm gonna let it go
No one has to know, so let it
Slide, baby, I'm gonna let it go
No one has to (No one—no one)
Slide, baby... Wow

[Intro]
"I had a dream
I had a dream I was flying over all of us
There were so many pretty people, so many pretty faces
I talked to some birds, I fell in love again
And none of this ever ended
Everything just kept going, and going, and going
And even when you laughed, you cried
And even when you were sad, you were really happy
'Cause you were here, and I got to meet every star
Every planet, everything that made me
And we all kissed, and became the same
We became the same, we became the same."

[Verse 1]
Who would have thought this? We almost lost it
When you lie inside darkness, it's hard to see
And we sleep in tradition, keep 'em off in the distance
To tell you that I haven't been

[Pre-Chorus]
We are all cold water
Why try at all? Why bother?

[Chorus]
Just hold me close, my darling
Just hold me close, my darling
Just hold me close, my darling
Just hold me close, my darling

[Verse 2]
Who would have dreamed this? You couldn't mean this
It would be some type of meanness to where you are
'Cause I don't know where to go
And no one else seems to know

[Pre-Chorus]
We are all night's fallen
Why try at all? Dark calling
So we're left alone, no one left to call upon
Be still my broken bones, as I travel on

[Chorus]
Just hold me close, my darling
Just hold me close, my darling
Hold me close, my darling
Just hold me close, my darling
So we're left alone, no one left to call upon
Be still my broken bones, as I travel on
Just hold me close, my darling
Just hold me close, my darling
Just hold me close, my darling
Just hold me close, my darling

[Outro]
Cold wa–
Cold wa–

[Produced by Childish Gambino & Ludwig Göransson]

[Verse]
I watch 'em all pass by the moon and stars
Let me hold him in my arms, forevermore
These cold nights, the park is ours
Standing by the side
Let you go on
To the sea, just for me
Don't ever leave me, my love
Keep holding on, let the modest go
As my mind goes to and fro
Waking up for one more show
We see him in the night
Tell him I'm not afraid of him
I'm not afraid of 'em, 'cause I won't know

[Produced by Childish Gambino & Ludwig Göransson]

[Intro: Priscilla Renea]
Seems like your heart stops workin'
The minute they close the curtain
You take off your mask
And take off your costume
And if anyone asks you're
Taking a smoke break, you
Drinking some coffee
But everyone knows what you're doin'
Seems like the bus moves slower
Just 'cause you got somewhere to go, so
You take a few pills in Beverly Hills
But if anyone asks you've
Got a prescription, you
Got an addiction
Who do you think that you're foolin'?

[Hook: Priscilla Renea]
John Doe
I just want the John I know
Once you put the drinks on hold
Maybe you could come back home
John Doe
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oooooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oooooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Ah
Errybody's addicted to somethin'
Errybody got a grip onto somethin'
Even if it's just to feel the response of appeal
Maybe once, maybe twice
Maybe hundreds of times, hundreds of times
Without it, it's just harder to function at times
You race to the bottom of every single bottle
As if there was someone or somethin' to find
You struggle in your mind
And you tell yourself lie after lie
'Til you get to the point where it's no longer private
The people that you work with notice the signs
When you walk in the room it gets noticeably quiet
So you break up the silence
You say you've been at the gym
But the way that you look, can't blame on the diet
So what you hidin'?

[Hook: Priscilla Renea]
John Doe
I just want the John I know
Once you put the drinks on hold
Maybe you could come back home
John Doe
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oooooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oooooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Yeah
I probably had too many things
Smashed too many freaks
Had too much to dro...
I mean, had too much to drink
Left the club, ended up in custody
Random drug test, passed it luckily
My girl broke up with me 'cause she walked in suddenly
With a woman up under me
I told her "Wait!
It ain't what it look like!
I must've slipped and fell, clumsy me!"
Well at least I admit it
'Cause the worst you could do is to do it and not be man enough to say that you did it
That's just how you prevent it
Well I ain't no different, I love all the money, the fame and the parties with beautiful women
I spent so much time as a underground artist 'cause I was afraid to succumb to the business
And what I'd become
But that what you'd judge you become
The path with the greatest resistance
That's how the tables can turn, when they pivot and change your perspective and flip your entire position
My whole life I've been dyin' and wishin' to live and experience everything possible
When I told them my dreams, they just said they ain't logical, now I can see it, it's optical

[Hook: Priscilla Renea]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oooooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oooooh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

I just want the John I know

Donald, can you explain the greatness of Sade’s debut album “Diamond Life.” I would appreciate a very detailed explanation of why Sade is so great and what she means to you as an artist. If you refuse to answer this question I will take it to mean you do not enjoy the musical styling of Sade….and as such you will draw my full ire
-22 y.o male who has just gotten heavily into Sade’s music

@ChildishGambino

I was literally listening to sade yesterday. she’s a world artist. and her music is just in tune with whatever vibration we all run on. I can’t answer a lot of your questions about her, all i can say is she’s a special artist/being@MaxGertler

You should read the ‘because the internet’ script when it’s released@CrookedModerator

If you could trade hairlines with another person, who would it be?

@ChildishGambino

They tell me i should fix my hairline cause i got money now

I ain’t gon sit around and front like i ain't thought about it

A perfect hairline is more appealing but it’s funny how

My shit is FUCKED UPPPPPPP but look how far i done got without it

I keep my HALF OF AN OCTAGON hairline fucked up just to show the kids it’s real@Kid_Kamikazee

What did your followers realize at the end of The Biggest Troll?

@ChildishGambino

They realize “they don’t need a leader”@Fran-Soul

Dude you are awesome love your music and my question is do you ever see your self touring Africa? coz that’s the only way I will ever see you unless you buy me a plane ticket to see you live in the US

Pliz respond

@ChildishGambino

I really wanna see africa. we were planning on south africa soon@WiggityWackWes

1. There were huge jumps style-wise and sonically from Camp to Royalty to Because the Internet, do you see yourself developing a “signature sound” or do you plan on keeping things experimental and constantly trying new sounds?

2. Your music has helped me through a lot and continues to, so I just wanted to take this opportunity to thank you for what you do. Thank you!

@ChildishGambino

Thanks

I always wanna experiment. in everything. i’ll always try to push myself. i just never wanna be bored@RayBeach

Do you make things that have or message or do you just let people interpret it? Kind of like 3005?

@ChildishGambino

I make things with messages for me in them. i hope they translate. sometimes they don’t, and that’s fine, but i usually just try to touch on something that’s intangible for me@BasedGator

Question part: What inspires you when it comes to production? I hear a lot of tradtional trap drums and sounds on the new album, which make sense since your from the south, but you didn’t really do that on Camp. Then you got something like ‘Zealots of Stockholm’ where it gets Death Grip-ish. Is it as simple as your just finding the right sound for the lyrics or do you draw from other things?

Since your probably not going to see/respond to this, let me stan a little bit haha

Stan part: You are my role model, I can identify with your life and lyrics so well it’s crazy. I really hope in 10 years I can be as successful and well respected as you. I already liked your comedy and acting, but ever since I found out you rapped and I heard that E.E. Cummings line in ‘Freaks and Geeks’ I was hooked. Anyway, The new album is dope as heck, great work as always sir, and I can’t wait to see what you do in the future





@ChildishGambino

Ha. thanks

I try not to think to hard about what’s trap drums, what’s influenced by who’s hot now, and all that. i try to just find what feels honest. cause i don’t know if i’d wanna hear a song that was considered entire original by everyone, but was no fun to make. this album, tho it came from a messy place, was by far the most fun to make@SavvyRJA

It sounds like you are influecnced by john lennon quite alot? care to elaborate?

@ChildishGambino

To be honest, i don’t know much about him. i was always a beach boys dude over beatles. i learned a little about him through jhene@SavvyRJA

Who is your favorite artist outside of Hip-Hop?

Perosnally, Gorillaz or Red Hot Chilli Peppers

@ChildishGambino

Anything by sam cooke@griffinmahon

Do you think there is more room for expression or creativity in short films as opposed to full-length movies? Does this translate to the relationship between mixtapes and albums in rap?

@ChildishGambino

Short films just fit normal people a little better. time is ultimate currency. we don’t have a lot of time to spend. a short film, for me, leaves more to the audience, and doesn’t take so much time. And if it’s free, then you really have no excuse not to watch it and at least have an opinion@Flowmatic

Whats your perspective on camp looking back at it now ?

@ChildishGambino

I love camp. it there’s little things i’d change, cause i know how music better, but yeah. i does what it’s supposed to do@FlyTendencies

How do you sing so beautifully?

@ChildishGambino

That’s what you call it?@A1_Day

Did My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and Yeezus’s sound play a role in Because The Internet? How big of a influence is Kanye to you?

@ChildishGambino

I guess it influenced me as much as it influenced all music to be better? but honestly, his whole steez isn’t for me. I can’t do that. he just inspires me to be limitless@StefanPonce

CAN YOU BREAK DOWN THE SONG TO “BOY BAND” ?!!!???!!!!

@ChildishGambino

@MYH

How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren’t real?

@ChildishGambino

Mirrors aren’t real@Metron

What’s the biggest opportunity that you could have taken but you missed out on in your life? Did you explain the abrupt ending on Life: The Biggest Troll?

(I forgot to @ before cuz I was excited)

@ChildishGambino

I don’t feel like I’ve missed any opportunity, honestly@GrizzyCreekwater

3 questions :

1) Favourite cartoon , what is your choice ?

2) Would you ever do more stand-up shows or skits for youtube ?

3) Favourite album in 2013 , from any genre ?

@ChildishGambino

I really like China, IL. American Dad has the best jokes. Adventure time. Regular Show. Amazing world of gumball@brockemsockemz

If you were an animal, what would you be?

@ChildishGambino

Koala@SavvyRJA

Who is your favorite philosopher?

@ChildishGambino

Patrice O'Neal and Louis CK@darwin_shameran

You have Andrew Auernheimer in your song, weev (Andrew) is openly known as a racist and anti-semite, how come you decided to include him?

@ChildishGambino

Video@Eon2323

Hey Donald, big fan here (actually #1 Gambino scholar here, but nbd). I have a couple of questions

1) Do you have a whole bunch of those white shirts or is it the same one?
2) Are you thinking about doing another comedy special in the near future?
3) What was your sister’s reaction to your fame and come up in the rap game?
4) Has Chevy Chase ever recited any of your lyrics or played any of your songs?

Thanks for just taking the time to read the questions. roscoes wetsuit

@ChildishGambino

First. thanks for doing all this work for me on rap genius

1) i have like 9 of these shirts

2) i honestly don’t know

3) she’s good with it. she’s the best

4) no. I’m positive he has never heard of childish gambino. I’m pretty sure he thought i was eddie murphy the entire we were on set@AkonoMiles

My question to you childish is what advice do you have for all the creatives out there that work so much on polishing their craft. that surround themselves with all types of shit, music, art, etc and try as much to absorb to than emit that knowledge into their work. what advice do you have childish cause sometimes i be feeling like im going nowhere. especially seeing others who do what i do get further than me when their ideas are really nothing but regurgetated shit we’ve all seen. i just feel like im going crazy sometimes yo. haha. thanks — akono

@ChildishGambino

Yeah. i think you have just look at what y o u really want. it can be frustrating. but u also have to know how people work and what people want from you

You should read “mastery” by robert greene@ChildishGambino

Cool. i have some work to do

Thanks for the questions. rap genius is a dope place. cool to see you guys taking such good care of it

Happy leak day

Everyone kiss notero goodnight

Learn to code

[Verse 1]
I'm standing here looking in the mirror
Saying "damn" to myself
I should have known the day would come
That she would find somebody else
And all the things I took her through
Shit, I shouldn't have lasted this long
Now I'm at this telephone booth calling Tyrone

[Chorus]
'Cause when a woman's fed up
(No matter how you beg, no)
It ain't nothing you can do about it
(Nothing you can do about it)
It's like running out of love
(No matter what you say, no)
And then it's too late to talk about it
(Too late to talk about it)

[Verse 2]
Now let's talk about how it all goes down
I used to make love to you daily
When the night fell the same
And anytime that you were hurt
I could feel your pain
And if I had a dollar
It was yours, yeah
And whenever we would go out
I would front the bill
But now the up is down
And the silence is sound
I hurt you too too many times
Now I can't come around

[Chorus]
'Cause when a woman's fed up
(No matter how you beg, no)
It ain't nothing you can do about it
Nothing you can do about it
It's like running out of love
(No matter what you say, no)
Running out of love
And then it's too late to talk about it
(Too late to talk about it)
Oh yeah, oh yeah

[Bridge]
La da da da da la la da da
La da da da da la la da da
Whoa, listen...
If you don't want to find out the hard way
Then listen to this song while the record plays

[Chorus]
'Cause when a woman's fed up
(No matter how you beg, no)
Mama taught me a long time ago
It ain't nothing you can do about it
Nothing you can do about it (Oh no, oh no)
It's like running out of love
(No matter what you say, no)
And then it's too late to talk about it
(Too late to talk about it)

[Outro] (throughout repeating chorus)
"You can cry a river
'Til an ocean starts to form, yeah
But she will always remember
'Cause she's a woman scorned
And if you ever get her back
It will never be the same, no, no
She's cuttin' the corners of her eyes
Every time she see your face
Now your trust is out the door
She don't want you no more
You used to tell your boys, not me
And she would always be there for you
If you had took the time to see
What that woman meant to you"
Is what the mirror said to me, whoa
She was raised in Illinois
Right outside of Chicago
Some of the best cookin' you ever had
Yes, it was and I miss her
Hey woman, if you're listening
I said I miss you baby
Whoa, oh yeah

[Verse 1: T3]
Speak to the hand, I'm Martin, You Tisha Campbell
Tired of livin' this life everyday it's a gamble
Puttin' pieces together that don't even assemble
Feelin' like somebody I don't like but I resemble
I'm so sick up in here and it's time to make moves
I try to blow caps in everything I do
My life is a shame I'm tryna just get through
I'm movin' through the trenches
With my mic and my crew
What am I 'posed to do? I got to keep goin'
Shit is happening for me I'm not even knowin'
The storm has passed and yet the flowers still growin'
Still makin' moves right now, shit is on'in
I see a glimpse of life that shines in my face
Warmness in my heart takes me to another place
See right now, what I want, I can achieve
All I have to do is stick to myself and believe

[Hook]
Where you at, uh-huh
(To all my street niggas makin' money, make it happen ya'll)
Where you at uh-huh
(To my ladies doin' your thing, do it to the best girl)
Where you at, uh-huh
(To all my Daft Punk people, makin' it happen, keep it movin', let's do it ya'll)
Where you at, uh-huh
(Uh, everybody, everybody ya'll)
Where you

[Verse 2: Baatin]
Don't make no sense, the way we are
Niggas can't get a chick (chick) without a car
Anybody ask me (me) I been the star (star)
Always knew that one day (day) I would go far
Some of these rap niggas they need a rain check (check)
I don't understand how they got a mic check (check)
Get your head right, true, you look a wreck
And in the meantime, we gon' get the pay check

[Interlude: T3]
You know, no, we ain't the ones to judge
But um, there's people out here
Who are really puttin' it down, and that's real
You know, Slum Village, can't even do our thing
Make it happen yo (tss) like this

[Hook]
Where you at uh-huh
(To my niggas down for the struggle, keep it up baby)
Where you at uh-huh
(My nine-to-five niggas, street hustlers, rolling dice niggas)
Where you at uh-huh
(To all my chicks tryna get the paper, keep doin' that)
Where you at uh-huh
(See everybody makin' moves, don't stop keep it all)

[Verse 3: Elzhi]
My eyes reflect Babylon of life and death on a tattered arm
From the drunk who staggered home to the destructive atom bomb, set to detonate
You wonder why I write so graphic
When here, bullets shatter light poles into white snow fragments
It's catastrophic that you picked up on it like an antenna object
You either find your hustle or demand your profit
Instead in the land of plot and schemin'
Cause today's microscopic, do bifocal fiber-optics
My friends die with suit and ties inside of boxes
Flip me out when you hit the ground like a fightin' ostrich
But life is just a pair of dice droppin', in mid stumble
A precious jewel you seclude when you in the struggle

[Outro]
Where you at uh-huh
Where you at uh-huh
Where you at uh-huh
Where you at uh-huh
Where you
Where you at uh-huh
Where you at uh-huh
Where you

[Intro]
Down, down, down
Mm, uh-huh
Huh, let's go!

[Verse 1]
When you got her in the back seat
Drivin' round the back streets
Trying to block me out
(Do you remember my name?)
Cruising down Santa Monica Boulevard
Does it light up the spark?
(Do you remember my name?)

[Pre-Chorus]
Is she your Ride-or-Die? Bitch
Does she know I'm tattooed onto your heart?
You can try to fight it
I have left my mark on you
There is nothing you can do

[Chorus]
When you think you're over me
And your bad baby's dead and gone
(Remember) I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real life suicide-blonde
(You like that?)
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be here, might be hot
But baby she's not me

[Hook]
She's not

[Verse 2]
When you take her to Chateau Marmont
'Cause you booked the top suite
Lay her on the bed
(Do you remember my name?)
Strip her down to her bare ass
In her Kiki de Montparnasse
Like I used to have
(Do you remember my name?)

[Pre-Chorus ]
Is she your Ride-or-Die? Bitch
Does she make you shiver under your skin
Just the way that I did?
It won't be the same again
She don't compare to who I am

[Chorus]
When you think you're over me
And your bad baby's dead and gone
(Remember) I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real life suicide-blonde
(You think that)
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be here, might be hot
But baby she's not me

[Bridge]
You try to forget and you tell her that you miss her
But I bet every time you go to kiss her
You get a hot rush feeling on your lips
It's me taking over you, throwing you a curveball
Reminding you of our true romance and
Just like the first time you learned to dance and
I showed you all those moves she can't do
She's not me (me, me)

[Chorus]
When you think you're over me
And your bad baby's dead and gone
(Remember) I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real life suicide-blonde
(You think that)
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be here, might be hot
But baby she's not me
When you think you're over me
And your bad baby's dead and gone
(Remember) I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real life suicide-blonde
(You think that)
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be here, might be hot
But baby she's not me
(Well,) I'm not the brightest crayon in the box
Everyone says I'm dumber than a bag of rocks
I barely even know... how to put on my own pants!
But I'm a genius in France (yeah), genius in France, genius in France!

Hoom chaka laka
Hoom chaka laka
Hoom chaka

I may not be the sharpest hunk of cheese
I got a negative number on my SATs
I'm not good looking and I don't know how to dance
But nevertheless and in spite of the evidence I am still widely considered to be a
Genius in France, genius in France, genius in France!

People say I'm a geek, a moronic little freak
An annoying pipsqueak with an unfortunate physique
If I was any dumber, they'd have to water me twice a week

But when the Mademoiselles see me, they all swoon and shriek
They dig my mystique, they think I'm c'est magnifique
When I'm in Par-ee, I'm the chic-est of the chic
They love my body odor and my bad toupee
They love my stripey shirt and my stupid beret

(Bow, dway-doo dway-doo bow, dway-doo dway-doo bow) And when I'm sipping on a Perrier
(Dway-doo dway-doo bow, dway-doo dway-doo bow) In some cafe down in Saint-Tropez
(Dway-doo dway-doo bow, yeah) It's hard to keep the fans at bay
They say, "Sign my poodle, s'il vous plait"
"Sign my poodle, s'il vous plait"

Hemenene humenene
Hemenene humenene
Poodle... poodle...

Folks in my hometown think I'm a fool
Got too much chlorine in my gene pool

A few peas short of a casserole
A few buttons missing on my remote control
A few fries short of a Happy Meal
I couldn't pour water out of a boot with instructions on the heel

Instructions on the heel
Instructions on the heel

But when I'm in Provence, I get free croissants
Yeah, I'm the guy every French lady wants
And if you ask 'em why, you're bound to get this response
(He's a genius in France! Genius in France!)
That's right
(He's a genius in France! Genius in France!)
You know it
(He's a genius in France, genius in France, genius in France!)

I'm not the brightest bulb on the Christmas tree
But the folks in France, they don't seem to agree
They say, "Bonjour, Monsieur would you take ze picture with me?"

I say, "Oui, oui"
That's right, I say, "Oui, oui"
("Oui, oui")
(He says, "Oui, oui")

I'm dumber than a box of hair
But those Frenchies don't seem to care
Don't know why, mon frere
But they love me there

I'm a genius in France
(Yeah) I'm a genius in France

Gonna make a big splash when I show up in Cannes
Gonna make those Frenchies scream
"You ze man! You ze man! You ze man!"
Like a fine Renoir (oir!), I've got that ''je ne sais quoi'' (quoi!)
Like a fine Renoir (ooh la la), I've got that ''je ne sais''
Quoi quoi quoi quoi quoi, (bow diddy) oo-wee-oo (yeah)
Quoi quoi quoi quoi quoi, (bow diddy) oo-wee-oo (didi-di di)

Bow diddy bow di bow di bow bow diddy
Bow diddy bow di bow di bow bow diddy
Bow

[snort]

I'm a taco short of a combo plate
But by some twist of fate, all the Frogs think I'm great
Oh, the men all faint and the women scream
They like me more than heavy cream

When I'm in Versailles, I'm a popular guy
My oh my, I'm as French as apple pie (apple pie)
They think I'm awful witty, a riot and a half
When I tell a stupid joke, they laugh (haw haw haw haw haw)
And laugh (haw haw haw haw haw haw)

People in France have lots of attitude
They're snotty and rude, they like disgusting food
But when they see me, they just come unglued
They think that I am one happening dude

Bowm ba ba bowm ba bowm ba bowm
I'm about as sharp as a bowling ball
But they like me better than Charles de Gaulle

Entre nous, it's very true
The room temperature's higher than my IQ
But they love me more than Gerard Depardieu
How did this happen; I don't have a clue (yeah)

Well, I'm not the quickest tractor on the farm
I don't have any skills or grace or charm
And most people look at me like I'm all covered with ants
But I'm a genius in France (yeah), genius in France, genius in France!

And I'm never goin' back, I'm never goin' back
I'm never never never never goin' back home again
I'm tearin' up my return flight ticket
Gonna tell the folks back home where they can stick it

Cause I'm never goin' back
I'm never goin' back
I'm never goin' back

The girls back home never gave me a chance
But I sho' 'nuff got them Frogs in some kinda trance
And I'm aware that it's a most improbable circumstance
But Great Googly Moogly, I'm a genius in France

Every Frenchie that I meet
Just can't wait to kiss my feet
Get in line, pucker up! ''Tout de suite''!

Bowm diddy bowm diddy bowm diddy

I'm gettin' even more famous by the hour
I'm stuffed with pastries and drunk with power
Now they're puttin' up my statue by the Eiffel Tower

A little more to the left, boys, a little more to the left
A little more to the left, boys, a little more to the left

I'm the biggest dork there is alive
My mom picked out my clothes for me 'till I was 35
And I forgot to mention
I'm not even welcome at the Star Trek convention

But the Frenchies think
That my poop don't stink
I'm a genius in France

Say, would you pass the Grey Poupon?
''Merci beaucoup''

[Verse 1]
Pale September, I wore the time like a dress that year
The autumn days swung soft around me like cotton on my skin
But as the embers of the summer lost their breath and disappeared
My heart went cold and only hollow rhythms resounded from within
But then he rose, brilliant as the moon in full
And sank in the burrows of my keep

[Chorus]
And all my armor falling down in a pile at my feet
And my winter giving way to warm as I'm singing him to sleep

[Verse 2]
He goes along just as a water lily
Gentle on the surface of his thoughts, his body floats
Unweighed down by passion or intensity
Yet unaware of the depth upon which he coasts
And he finds a home in me
For what misfortune sows, he knows my touch will reap

[Chorus]
And all my armour falling down in a pile at my feet
And my winter giving way to warm as I'm singing him to sleep
All my armour falling down in a pile at my feet
And my winter giving way to warm as I'm singing him to sleep

[Outro]
All my armour falling down in a pile at my feet
And my winter giving way to warm as I'm singing him to sleep

[Verse 1]
Is it my turn to wish you were lying here?
I tend to dream you when I'm not sleeping
Is it my turn to fictionalize my world?
Or even imagine your emotions, tell myself anything
Is it my turn to take you by your hands?
Tell you, I love you and you not hear me
Is it my turn to totally understand?
To watch you walk out of my life and not do a damn thing

[Hook]
If I have to give away, every feeling that I feel, yeah
If I have to sacrifice, oh, whatever babe, whatever, baby
If I have to take apart, all that I am
Is there anything that I would not do, inside I'd die without you

[Verse 2]
Oh, I apologize for all the things I've done
But now, I'm underwater and I'm drowning
Is it my turn to be the one to cry?
Isn't it amazing how some things completely turn around?
Take every little piece of my heart
Take every little piece of my soul
Take every little piece of my mind
Cause if you're gone, inside, I'd die without you

[Bridge]
Cause inside I'd die without you
Yeah baby I'd die without you
Can't you see that I'd die without you?

[Hook]

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 1]
I want in, like a substitute
I've been working awful hard for you
But you don't say, you just hold your breath
So I can't touch what I haven't yet
She's a cold one and it hurts me so
It's a dark path and a heck of a cold
And she could kill me like she did before

[Chorus]
Oh we'd be so free
Happy alone
Sharing a smile
So far from home

[Verse 2]
Push in and I pull it away
It's a hard part but the true love way
Girl you're wanted like a wanted man
With your smart mouth and your killer hand
We could both share all that I have made
For a young man it's a heck of a wage
And I feel crazy when I see your face

[Chorus]
Because we'd be so free
Happy alone
Sharing a smile
So far from home
And we would laugh
Laugh till we cry
Making a song
Making me lie

[Bridge]
People say our babies are walking this town
People say our babies are walking this town
People say our babies are just wandering around
People say our babies are walking

[Chorus]
Because we'd be so free
Happy alone
Sharing a smile
So far from home
And we would laugh
Laugh till we cry
Making a song
Making me lie
How
Fast
Can a heart shatter?
Before
You're
Walking on splinters
Your head
Aches
Just
To feel what it knows
Please leave the light on when you go
Please leave the light on when you go

How
Can
You fix something
That you
Can't
Touch without hurting
The
Lesson
You've learned
Is leaving you dumb
Please leave the light on when its done
Please leave the light on when its done
Standing
High above
Floodline
Watching
All your belongings go by
Go by (3x)
Go
Go home
Go home bye go home
Go by
Go by

[?]
Watch it fly (6x)
...
Watch it fly

How
Can
You see the ending
When you're lost
At the beginning
The day takes all that the night left behind
Please leave the light on when it dies
Please leave the light on when it dies

[Verse 1]
I tell you how I feel, but you don't care
I say tell me the truth, but you don't dare
You say love is a hell you cannot bear
And I say "Give me mine back and then go there
For all I care"

[Chorus]
I got my feet on the ground
And I don't go to sleep to dream
You got your head in the clouds
And you're not at all what you seem
This mind, this body and this voice cannot be stifled by your deviant ways
So don't forget what I told you; don't come around, I got my own hell to raise

[Verse 2]
I have never been so insulted in all my life
I could swallow the seas to wash down all this pride
First you run like a fool just to be at my side
And now you run like a fool but you just run to hide
And I can't abide

[Chorus]
I got my feet on the ground
And I don't go to sleep to dream
You got your head in the clouds
And you're not at all what you seem
This mind, this body, and this voice cannot be stifled by your deviant ways
So don't forget what I told you; don't come around, I got my own hell to raise

[Bridge]
Don't make it a big deal, don't be so sensitive
We're not playing a game anymore
You don't have to be so defensive

[Verse 3]
Don't you plead me your case, don't bother to explain
Don't even show me your face, cause it's a crying shame
Just go back to the rock from under which you came
Take the sorrow you gave and all the stakes you claim
And don't forget the blame

[Chorus]
I got my feet on the ground
And I don't go to sleep to dream
You got your head in the clouds
And you're not at all what you seem
This mind, this body and this voice cannot be stifled by your deviant ways
So don't forget what I told you; don't come around, I got my own hell to raise
I got my feet on the ground
And I don't go to sleep to dream
You got your head in the clouds
And you're not at all what you seem
This mind, this body and this voice cannot be stifled by your deviant ways
So don't forget what I told you; don't come around, I got my own hell to raise

[Verse 1]
Days like this, I don't know what to do with myself
All day and all night
I wander the halls along the walls
And under my breath I say to myself
"I need fuel to take flight"

[Chorus]
And there's too much going on
But it's calm under the waves
In the blue of my oblivion
Under the waves
In the blue of my oblivion

[Verse 2]
Is that why they call me a sullen girl, sullen girl
They don't know I used to sail the deep and tranquil sea
But he washed me 'shore
And he took my pearl
And left an empty shell of me

[Chorus]
And there's too much going on
But it's calm under the waves
In the blue of my oblivion
Under the waves
In the blue of my oblivion
Under the waves
In the blue of my oblivion
It's calm under the waves
In the blue of my oblivion

[Verse 1]
Once my lover, now my friend
What a cruel thing to pretend
What a cunning way to condescend
Once my lover, and now my friend

[Verse 2]
Oh, you creep up like the clouds
And you set my soul at ease
Then you let your love abound
And you bring me to my knees

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's evil, babe
The way you let your grace enrapture me
When well you know I'd be insane
To ever let that dirty game recapture me

[Chorus]
You made me a shadowboxer, baby
I wanna be ready for what you do
I've been swinging around me
'Cause I don't know when you're gonna make your move

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Oh, your gaze is dangerous
And you fill your space so sweet
If I let you get too close
You'll set your spell on me

[Verse 4]
So, darlin', I just want to say
Just in case I don't come through
I was on to every play
I just wanted you

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so evil, my love
The way you've no reverence to my concern
So I'll be sure to stay wary of you, love
To save the pain of once my flame and twice my burn

[Chorus]
So, I'm a shadowboxer, baby
I wanna be ready for what you do
And I've been swinging around at nothing
I don't know when you're gonna make your move

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm a shadowboxer, baby
I wanna be ready for what you do
And I've been swinging around me
'Cause I don't know when you'll make your move

[Verse 1]
You moved like honey in my dream last night
Yeah, some old fires were burning
You came near to me and you endeared to me
But you couldn't quite discern me

[Verse 2]
Does that scare you? I'll let you run away
But your heart will not oblige you
You'll remember me like a melody
Yeah, I'll haunt the world inside you

[Refrain]
And my big secret
Gonna win you over
Slow like honey
Heavy with mood

[Verse 3]
I'll let you see me, I'll covet your regard
I'll invade your demeanor
And you'll yield to me like a scent in the breeze
And you'll wonder what it is about me

[Refrain]
It's my big secret
Keeping you coming
Slow like honey
Heavy with mood

[Verse 4]
Though dreams can be deceiving
Like faces are to hearts
They serve for sweet relieving
When fantasy and reality lie too far apart

[Bridge]
So I stretch myself across like a bridge
And I pull you to the edge

[Verse 5]
And stand there waiting
Trying to attain
The end to satisfy the story
Shall I release you?
Must I release you?
As I rise to meet my glory

[Refrain]
But my big secret
Gonna hover over your life
Gonna keep you reaching
When I'm gone like yesterday
When I'm high like heaven
When I'm strong like music
'Cause I'm slow like honey
And heavy with mood

[Verse 1]
I lie in an early bed thinking late thoughts
Waiting for the black to replace my blue
I do not struggle in your web
Because it was my aim to get caught
But daddy longlegs, I feel
That I'm finally growing weary
Of waiting to be consumed by you

[Chorus]
Give me the first taste
Let it begin
Heaven cannot wait forever
Darling, just start the chase
I'll let you win
But you must make the endeavor

[Verse 2]
Oh, your love give me a heart contusion
Adagio breezes fill my skin with sudden red
Your hungry flirt borders intrusion
And I'm building memories
On things we have not said

[Breakdown]
Full is not heavy as empty
Not nearly my love
Not nearly my love
Not nearly

[Chorus]
Give me the first taste
Let it begin
Heaven cannot wait forever
Darling, just start the chase
I'll let you win
But you must make the endeavor

[Outro]
The first taste
Let it begin, heaven cannot wait forever
Start the chase, I'll let you win
But you must make the endeavor

[Verse 1]
Darling, give me your absence tonight
Take the shade from the canvas and leave me the white
Let me sink in the silence that echoes inside
And don't bother leaving the light on

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I suddenly feel like a different person
From the roots of my soul come a gentle coercion
And I ran my hand o'er a strange inversion
A vacancy that just did not belong

[Chorus]
The child is gone

[Bridge]
Honey, help me out of this mess
I'm a stranger to myself
But don't reach for me, I'm too far away
I don't wanna talk 'cause there's nothing left to say

[Verse 2]
So my darling, give me your absence tonight
Take all of your sympathy and leave it outside
'Cause there's no kind of loving that can make this all right
I'm trying to find a place I belong

[Pre-Chorus]
And I suddenly feel like a different person
From the roots of my soul come a gentle coercion
And I ran my hand o'er a strange inversion
As the darkness turns into the dawn

[Chorus]
The child is gone
The child is gone

[Verse 1]
Won't do no good to hold no séance
What's gone is gone, and you can't bring it back around
Won't do no good to hold no searchlight
You can't illuminate what time has anchored down

[Pre-Chorus]
Honey, I've gone away
Hey, I've gone away
I've gone away

[Verse 2]
Won't do no good to sing no love song
No sound could simulate the presence of a man
Won't do no good asking no questions
Your divination should acquaint you with the plan

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, honey, I've gone away
Honey, I've gone away
Honey, I've gone away

[Chorus]
My feel for you, boy
Is decaying in front of me
Like the carrion of a murdered prey
And all I want
Is to save you, honey
Or the strength to walk
Away

[Verse 3]
Won't do no good to go no distance
The space between us is as boundless as the dark
Won't do no good to throw no fist, babe
You can't intimidate me back into your arms

[Pre-Chorus]
Because, honey, I've gone away
I've gone away
I've gone away

I've gone away
I've gone away
I've gone
Away

[Chorus]
My feel for you, boy
Is decaying in front of me
Like the carrion of a murdered prey
And all I want
Is to save you, honey
Or the strength to walk
Away
My feel for you, boy
Is decaying in front of me
Like the carrion of a murdered prey
And all I want is to
Save you, honey, or the
Strength to walk away

Ohhh!
My feel for you, boy
Is decaying right in front of me
Like the carrion of a murdered prey
And all I want is to
Save you, honey, or the
Strength to walk away

[Verse 1]
As I drove across on the highway, my jeep began to rock
I didn't know what to do, so I stopped
Then got out and looked down, I noticed I've got a flat
So I walked out, parked the car, like sideways
So I can find what I can fix
I looked around, there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange feeling, like a mist
So I walked down towards the end of the road
And in the fog, a woman appeared
She said, "Don't you worry, my friend, I'll take care
Take my hand, I'll take you there"

[Chorus]
Oh, take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name (Yeah, oh)
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to (Oh) a place without (Yeah) no name

[Verse 2]
As she took me right through the fog
I seen a beautiful city appear
At where kids are playin'
And people are laughin' and smilin' and nothin' to fear
She said, "This is the place where no people have pain
With love and happiness"
She turned around, looked down in my eyes
And started cryin'
Grab my hand, you've got a friend, oh

[Chorus]
Take me to a place without no name (No name)
Take me to (See) a place without no name
A place without no name
Take me to (Can't believe) a place without (I can't believe) no name
Take me to a place without no name

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa, yeah
Don't go, oh

[Bridge]
She started liking me, kissing me, and hugging me
She didn't really, really want me to leave
She showed me places I've never seen
And things I've never done, this really looks like a lot of fun
I've seen the grass, and the skies, and the birds
And the flowers, surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with love and happiness
How in the world, could I wanna leave?
So then I went in my pocket, took my wallet all out
With my pictures of my family and girl
This is the place that you choose to be with me
When you thought you could be in another world, oh

[Chorus]
Take me to (Don't go) a place
Without (I can't believe) no name (No name)
Take me to (See) a place without no name
Take me to (I can't believe) a place without (Don't go) no name
A place without no name
Take me to (See) a place without no name

[Outro]
No, no, no
La, la, la, la, la (La, la)
La, la, la, la
A place without no name
La, la, la, la, la (La, la, la)
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la (La, la, la)
La, la, la, la
A place without no name
La, la, la, la, la (See, a place without)
La, la, la, la
A place without no name
La, la, la, la, la (I can't believe, I can't believe)
La, la, la, la (I can't believe it)
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
A place without no name
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
A place without no name
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
Never twenty-one when everyone's a sailor
Coming up strong at the animal bar
Ever loving mug of Mr. Norman Mailer
Turn another page at the animal bar
And it won't be long
No, it won't be long
No, it won't be long
Because it can't be long

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
I, I, I— The cry of isolation
I, I, I— The high of meditation
I, I, I— For sweet precipitation
I, I, I— The high of deprivation
And it won't be long
No, it won't be long
No, it won't be long
Because it can't be long

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
Rain on my frustration (Bah-pa-ra-pa)
(Bah-pa-ra-pa) Stake my claim, now break this
Wash me down, my station (Bah-pa-ra-pa)
(Bah-pa-ra-pa) Makes more rain forsaken
In between the sky and every piece of the earth (Bah-pa-ra-pa)
(Bah-pa-ra-pa) (Bah-pa-ra-pa) (One, two, three— Let's break this!)
Runnin' through the mud, I gotta feeling of worth (Bah-pa-ra-pa)
(Bah-pa-ra-pa) (One, two, three— Forsake this!)

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
All aboard the ship, 'cause you're gonna need an ark
When the wet comes down, you'll be swimming like a shark
Mopping up the pain and I'm a little older
Right as rain at the animal bar
And it won't be long
No, it won't be long
No, it won't be long
Because it can't be long

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
I, I, I— The cry of isolation
I, I, I— The high of meditation
I, I, I— For sweet precipitation
I, I, I— The high of deprivation
And it won't be long
No, it won't be long
No, it won't be long
Because it can't be long

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
Rain on my frustration (Bah-pa-ra-pa)
(Bah-pa-ra-pa) Stake my claim, now break this
Wash me down, my station (Bah-pa-ra-pa)
(Bah-pa-ra-pa) Makes more rain forsaken (Bah-pa-ra-pa)
In between the sky and every piece of the earth (Bah-pa-ra-pa)
(Bah-pa-ra-pa) (Bah-pa-ra-pa) (One, two, three— Let's break this!)
Runnin' through the mud, I gotta feeling of worth (Bah-pa-ra-pa)
(Bah-pa-ra-pa) (One, two, three— Forsake this!)

[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Raindrops will fall from the sky
Stealing their shape from your eye
Now we can all get some sleep
The water, the water
The water saving us from the heat
Some things will die in their place
Others will leave little trace
And fire will come find its day
The water, the water
The water washing it all away

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
Rain on my frustration (Bah-pa-ra-pa)
(Bah-pa-ra-pa) Stake my claim, now break this
Wash me down, my station (Bah-pa-ra-pa)
(Bah-pa-ra-pa) Makes more rain forsaken
In between the sky and every piece of the earth (Bah-pa-ra-pa)
(Bah-pa-ra-pa) (One, two, three— Let's make this!)
In between the sky and every piece of the earth (Bah-pa-ra-pa)
(Bah-pa-ra-pa) (One, two, three— Forsake this!)
In between the sky and every piece of the earth (Bah-pa-ra-pa)
(Bah-pa-ra-pa) (One, two, three— Let's make this!)
In between the sky and every piece of the earth (Bah-pa-ra-pa)
(Bah-pa-ra-pa) (One, two, three— Forsake this!)

"TERIYAKI JOE: NEO-HARLEM DETECTIVE"

Chapter 4: Pie

Slurp..Slurp...Slurp...Sluuuuurp...SlurpSlurpSlurpSlurp...hmmmph!...aaah!...*Gulp* :)

"Happy Valentines Day Baby" she says with a wink. I fell for the Mohawk. She fell for the 10,000 Units. The business of love in the streets

Had to relieve some tension before I made my first move. Decisions made while being tense always come back to bite you in the ass. Clarity

"Everybody" just for 1 person. Seems a bit extreme. Even for a "Parker." You'd think all that Taichi would make them a little more peaceful

A little more humane. Hell even a little more robotic would be nice at least they have a valid point. This whole thing has funk on it

I know 11 was serious though. Deadly serious. Serious as the 100 Million Units he winked at me when I refused to take the job

Serious when he said in 5 days he'd "update" every food pill in Neo-Harlem so instead of the shakes you got the deads right after dinner. ;)

Get rich and save Neo-Harlem. I like that.  Getting lost in the VooDoo and probably end up destroying Neo-Harlem anyway. I don't like that
Things tend to get real possible when you got a gun to your head or money in your hands. I got both. Mix fear with reward. I'm impressed

Lost dogs are easy. Easy as pie. Find some shabby two-Unit witch doctor have him call some flea bag back from the VooDoo, Exorcise & Upload

Getting a human soul back from the afterlife is lets say a little more complicated than that. Not pie at all. Devils pie is what it is

Shit!

---End Of Chapter 4---

[Verse 1]
When are you gonna come down?
When are you going to land?
I should have stayed on the farm
I should have listened to my old man
You know you can't hold me forever
I didn't sign up with you
I'm not a present for your friends to open
This boy's too young to be singing the blues

[Refrain]
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah

[Chorus]
So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough
Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny-back toad
Oh, I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

[Refrain]
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah

[Verse 2]
What do you think you'll do, then?
I bet they'll shoot down the plane
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again
Maybe you'll get a replacement
There's plenty like me to be found
Mongrels who ain't got a penny
Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground

[Refrain]
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah

[Chorus]
So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough
Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny-back toad
Oh, I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

[Refrain]
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah
Just like the light show
Just like the light show (show)
Just like the light show

Better lock and load
Cause I'm ready up glow
Like the laser light show
Oh oh oh
Watch me go 'bout to lose control
By the laser light, laser light, laser light show

I gotta know you're from out of space
You gotta glow
You live without a trace
You take the party, pa-party back
Party, pa-party back

Put the hands in the air and the party go
Bring the party back

Like the roll glowing
She rocks and she rolled, rolled
Baby don't stop what you're doing
Just got into your glowing
I go oh
You take off later
Show oh just like the light show

Better lock and load
Cause I'm ready up glow
Like the laser light show
Oh oh oh
Watch me go 'bout to lose control

Laser light, laser light, laser light show

[Intro]
This song goes out...
To all the people out there that be runnin' their mouth
And don't know what the hell they sayin'...
Shut up

[Verse 1]
Now that I've got my voice back, let me start off by saying that
I appreciate the fans around the world that had my back
And I just wanna thank God upstairs for keepin' his hands on me
And for keeping all the doctors' focus during my surgery
Now, there's a couple of things I've gotta get off my chest
Some serious issues that I must address
Well lets just get right to it
People said that I was done
Said there was no way this time he's gonna overcome
And even before the doctors were done and I could awake
A tsunami of rumors had come to wipe my career away
After twenty two years of a blessed career
They had me lyin' in my hospital bed cryin' mad tears (woo hoo hoo)
But just as I had many people hatin' me, I had so many people lovin' me
And lets not forget the hood around the world coverin' me
But to everybody that be callin' me, tellin' me what they be sayin' about me
Bringin' me all of this negative shit, y'all the ones I ain't fuckin' with
It's time for me to evaluate the people that I let up in my space
Can I get a witness for all of this, people all up in your business

[Hook 2x]
Tell em, shut up
Tell em, shut up
Tell em, shut up
I'm talkin' to you

[Verse 2]
He's washed up, he's lost it, he ain't got it no more
Well I'm here to tell you today, boy you haters are so slow
And it saddens me to know some of y'all want me to go away
But when it's time for me to go, my God is gonna orchestrate
Until then, I will accept the stones and pray and just try and get along
But sometimes it's so hard for me to be strong
I got kids and I'm tryna love em
So many things I'm tryna juggle
But I never thought this music would become my struggle
The news said I lost my house
My own people put me down
And my friends no longer around no
But you see deep underneath the surface
Now it feels that something's working in my behalf, a victory is near
See my future ain't my past, it's not the end of the hourglass
Who said it would not last?
Fans, sick their ass

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now seriously after all these hits and melodies and memories
You compare me to someone else, O-M-G
No offense to the other artist, but come on dog, lets be honest
How many babies been made off me? O-M-G
Seriously, you're gon' act like that
Sit there like there ain't no truth to that
Lookin' at me like I'm not talkin' stats, O-M-G
Every boy, every girl, every child around the world
From the 90s up until today was made off me

Shut up, shut up, shut up
I'm talkin' to you
Shut up, bout my life
(?)
So just shut up, just shut up

[Verse 1]
Let's wake up, it's dinner time, turn up
Pull up to the crib and a nigga on silk, come fuck with a nigga
Bout to bang on a pussy like I'm throwing up Crip
Fuck with a nigga
You gon' wanna claim this dick, fuck with a nigga
Fuck with a nigga, come fuck with a nigga
Ooh, she rollercoaster'd on it (ohh)
She threw it up an alley (oop)
Then I beat the pussy til it's (blue)

You wonder how I'm the best and can do all this with my mouth

[Verse 2]
Cookie, cookie, cookie, I'm a cookie monster
Break your back, crack it open like a lobster

Let it rain, let it rain (rain)

[Pre-Chorus]

You wonder how I'm the best and can do all this with my mouth

[Verse 3]
Girl, I've got a sweet tooth, ain't nothin' sweeter than you
I'mma eat it up, beat it up, til you holler out truce
My bed can be your stage, and I'ma make you a star
Your legs in the air and my hands all up in your cookie jar
Yeah, I'm hittin' every spot on your map, that's me going on tour
My Tom Ford, your Just Cavalli, that's clothes all on the floor
You throwin' ass, I'm catchin' it, the neighbors keepin' score
Louie Armstrong, I pick you up, eat that against the door

[Bridge]
Mmm, like an Oreo
I love to lick the middle like an Oreo (turn up)
Oreo, Oreo, like an Oreo
I wanna bite it, and get inside it (til I get you gone)

[Chorus]
You wanna know how I get down?
You wanna know how I get down?
You wonder how I'm the best and can do all this with my mouth
You wanna know how I get down?
You wanna know how I get down?
You wonder how I'm the best and can do all this with my mouth

[Outro]
Cookie monster

[Verse 1]
Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled

They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in

And I would've liked to know you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

[Verse 2]
Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid

And even when you died
Oh, the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in

And I would've liked to know you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

[Verse 3]
Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
Goodbye, Norma Jeane
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

[Chorus]
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in

And I would've liked to know you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

[Intro]
I just wanna marry the pussy (put a ring on it)
I just wanna marry the pussy (put a ring on it)
I just wanna marry the pussy (put a ring on it)
Wanna go down on my knees, ask that pussy to marry me

[Verse 1]
Sight for sore eyes my best friend, my better half
Been good to me, it's love to me, can't explain what it do to me
Pussy talk to me, pussy sing to me
So much joy it bring to me
When I call the pussy, it come right away
And I call the pussy like every day
Yeah I love pussy and pussy love me

And if I'm ever in the mood for two pussies
Then the pussy will bring another pussy to me

[Chorus]
This is a sex proposal
I just wanna marry the pussy

(Pussy will you marry me?)
I just wanna marry the pussy
Wanna go down on my knees and ask that pussy to marry me

[Verse 2]
Pussy been so sweet to me
It feeds me, so good to me
Always open up to me, it moans for me and it cries to me
Pussy's there when I fall asleep
Let's me know that it belongs to me
And I love the way that pussy screams when it tells me I'm so freaky
No one compares to this pussy
Because this pussy is the best pussy
Baby we put on  a tux, break out a ring
Because this pussy is the realest pussy (to me)

[Chorus]
This is a sex proposal
I just wanna marry the pussy

Wanna go down on my knees and ask that pussy to marry me

[Verse 3]
Yeah I spank that pussy like it's so naughty
And I drive that pussy crazy, that's my Bugatti
Make that pussy hot and wet, that's Miami climate
Tongue down her landing strip, no auto-pilot
Yeah, eat that pussy, kiss that pussy
Beat that pussy like I own that pussy
Get in that pussy, drill that pussy
Make her love come down til I drown that pussy
And I take my time in it, that's the scenic route
Sex trainer, I work pussy out
Tell her pop that pussy like you're from the south
Swear the pussy so good she got a nigga writin' vows

[Chorus]
I just wanna marry the pussy
(I just wanna marry the pussy)
I just wanna marry the pussy
(Down on my knees with a ring yeah)
I just wanna marry the pussy
(All those times that I was horny)
Wanna go down on my knees and ask that pussy to marry me

[Outro]
Yeah, would you marry me pussy? Would ya?
Would you marry me pussy? Yeah
Say yes, say yes, say yes
Goin' down on my knees, marry me pussy
Goin' down on my knees, marry me pussy
And I'm gonna make you happy pussy
And I'm gonna make you happy pussy
And I'm gonna make you happy pussy
Oh baby, I'm wanting to do you a swap
I'll give you anything, yeah
In return for the noises you've got
And I can see you want to be attended to
Just count to twenty-nine and I'll attend to you
Oh for sure... well certainly, yeah yeah yeah
Wavin' bye to the train or the bus
I'm ever so worried because...
I don't want to get all forgotten...

So very comfortable..
Don't really need to put up my feet
And even in fat sam's grand slam
Can't see it being easier to speak
When you've karate-kicked your way to someone new
And I'm a memory and don't know what to do
All on his own...
Collecting his dole n' stuff

Wavin' bye to the train or the bus
I'm ever so worried because...
I don't want to get all forgotten...
Cause we know
Yeah, we know-oh-oh-oh
Oh we know, a woah-oh-oh
Don't know where we're going, baby
I s'pose it depends
But even if we're all far apart
We can all come back and all be fine
We'll be able to be together again

Be together again
Be together again
Be together again
Be together again
Be together again
Be together again

Everybody will be together again!

[Intro: Pitbull]
Let's, Mr. Worldwide take over
MK
Jim Jonsin, Globe, let's take over the globe

[Pre-Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
Where do we go from here?
World, tell me, please
Where do we go from here?
I want the world to tell me, please

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx & (Pitbull)]
Where do we go? (Where do we go? Where do we go?)
Where do we go? (Where do we go? Where do we go?)
Where do we go? (Where do we go? Where do we go?)
Where do we go? (Where do we go from here?)

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
How you gon' tell me the sky's the limit
When there's footprints on the moon?
I don't need a TV show to dance with the stars
Not me, I'm good
Half of the world don't like me
Half of the world wanna be me
But believe it or not
That pretty little thing they call Earth needs me
I'm here to show the world
What it is to make something from nothing
Yeah, fo' sho'
I'm here to show the world what it is to do good business
How to blow what I blow
I'm here to show the world that money don't buy happiness
Believe me, I know
But just one thing, once I've showed the world
I just wanna know

[Pre-Chorus: Jamie Foxx]
Where do we go from here?
World, tell me, please
Where do we go from here?
I want the world to tell me, please

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx & Pitbull]
Where do we go? (Where do we go? Where do we go?)
Where do we go? (Where do we go? Where do we go?)
Where do we go? (Where do we go? Where do we go?)
Where do we go? (Where do we go from here?)

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
As the suns rotates and Pit gets bigger
The more countries in the world, I hit 'em all
Armando Bond, double 0-305, aka. Mr. Worldwide
Don't be silly, I've had it on lock and that's fo' sho'
I've already changed my city
Now I'm on my way to change the globe
I'm tryna inspire the world to show 'em what it is
When you hustle and you work hard
Show 'em what it is to put your life on the line
For the love of the grind
Life is a rhyme with no reason
And that's the reason that I rhyme
But once I show the globe
I just wanna know

[Pre-Chorus: Jamie Foxx & Pitbull]
Where do we go from here? (Where do we go from here?)
World, tell me, please (World, tell me, please)
Where do we go from here? (Where do we go from here?)
I want the world to tell me please (World, tell me, please)
Where do we go from here? (Where do we go from here?)
World, tell me, please (World, tell me, please)
Where do we go from here? (Where do we go from here?)
I want the world to tell me, please

[Chorus: Jamie Foxx & Pitbull]
Where do we go? (Where do we go? Where do we go?)
Where do we go? (Where do we go? Where do we go?)
Where do we go? (Where do we go? Where do we go?)
Where do we go? (Where do we go from here?)

[Verse 1]
You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be?
You're frozen when your heart's not open
You're so consumed with how much you get
You waste your time with hate and regret
You're broken when your heart's not open

[Chorus]
Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

[Verse 2]
Now there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same
If I lose you, my heart will be broken
Love is a bird, she needs to fly
Let all the hurt inside of you die
You're frozen when your heart's not open

[Chorus]
Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

[Verse 3]
You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be?
You're frozen when your heart's not open

[Chorus]
Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key
If I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

[Outro]
If I could melt your heart

[Verse 1]
Where did they go?
Where did everybody go?
I wanna know
We could've tried
Why did everybody cry if you weren't mine?

[Chorus]
And now everything is gonna change
You made your mind up
Well, my friends, you've got a lot to learn, you do
Why do we deny ourselves in terms of love?
I'm at a loss, so well, oh well
Oh well
Oh well
Oh well

[Verse 2]
Can't find the words
But hey, man, everybody hurts
When it doesn't work

[Chorus]
And now everything is gonna change
You made your mind up
Well, my friends, you've got a lot to learn, you do
Why do we deny ourselves in terms of love?
I'm at a loss, so well, oh well
Oh well
Oh well
Oh well

[Bridge]
Your love drowned us in a hole
You never ever wanted her to grow
To grow
Oh, oh
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?

[Chorus]
If everything is gonna change, was it worth it?
Oh, my friends, you've got a lot to learn, you do
Why do we deny ourselves in terms of love?
You weren't strong enough, oh well, for me...
Oh well
Oh well, oh well
Oh well
Oh well, oh well, oh well
Oh well, oh well, oh well, oh well
Oh well, oh well, oh well
Oh well

[Verse 1]
You got your H.P. Lovecraft
Your Edgar Allan Poe
You got your unkind of ravens
And your murder of crows
Catty eyelashes
And your Dracula cape
Been flashing triple-A passes
At the cemetery gates

[Chorus]
'Cause you're so dark, babe
But I want you hard
You're so dark, baby

[Refrain]
You're so dark
You're so dark
You're so dark
You're so dark

[Verse 2]
And you're so mysterious
Got that obsession with death
I saw you driving your Prius
And even that was Munster Koach-esque
You watch Italian horror
And you listen to the scores
Leather-cladded, spike collared
I want you down on all fours

[Chorus]
'Cause you're so dark, babe
But I want you hard
You're so dark, baby

[Bridge]
I know you're nothing like mine
'Cause she's walking on sunshine
And your love would tear us apart
And I know I'm not your type
'Cause I don't shun the daylight
But, baby, I'm willing to start

[Refrain]
You're so dark

[Verse 3]
Got your H.P. Lovecraft
Your Edgar Allen Poe
Got your unkind of ravens
Got your murder of crows

[Chorus]
You're so dark, babe
But I want you hard
You're so dark, baby
But I want you hard
You're so dark, oh
But I want you hard
You're so dark, baby

It's alive, it's alive
It's alive in the name of god
Now I know what it feels like to be God
I, K-Dizzle

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
I rap with a Pyrex in the projects
I'm crack in a pot, I'm a prospect
I'm a pirate on a dock full of dope, uh
I can dissect any rapper
You could vote for the Lochness
You can not test no King in a Tesla
Bitch, I ride like a freight train parked outside
And my young niggas came with the extras, uh

Teriyaki Joe: Neo-Harlem Detective

Chapter 5: Gumbo

Morning. The sky is a television screen. The "sky" is the bottom of Central Park

A sunrise and a sunset and all other galactic phenomenon are broadcasted across the bottom of Central Park to be viewed by us Downstairs

The bottom of Neo-Harlem provides the same courteous service to Neo-Orleans which won its spot underneath us. We call it the basement

Underneath that in no particular order is Old London, Sau Paulo, what's left of Los Angeles & Moscow and that's pretty much it

City states stacked on top of each other like a shish kabob. Earth decided to a go a little nuts orbitally speaking.

Scientist still can't explain it. But in short Earth began spinning out of control &. what wasn't literally thrown into space was BBQ'd off.

Some say that's it all a conspiracy and were actually living inside some science project out in the middle of the desert & nothing is real.

Either way here we are. The cities or at least the parts that were able survive the tumult & the apocalyptic meltdown that followed...
..signed treaties and created "The Caste" with the ruthless & rich Central Park literally at the top and us unlucky bastards at the bottoms.

The rest of the planet is either fully automated manufacturing facilities or nothing. Central Park controls all modes of production.

Everything else, religion, philosophy, crime, etc just kind gets in where it fits in. Not lawless but definitely "law-least." Why not?

When the very Earth you live on takes an unexpected shit on you & your way of life everything kinda goes out of focus. Welcome to the blur.

The position of the real Sun over Central Park hasn't changed in about 100 years. If it wasn't 4 the Nano-Gravy it would've been burned away.

It's literally the tip of the iceberg. Gotta be "born" there to live there kinda jazz. An Invitation only Taichi party for the fancy tyrant.

It's ultra-simplistic in form. Just grass, the glass buildings and the all encompassing Gravy. No history, no future. Just never-ending now.

No pressures, no sympathies. Just calm and nihilism. Hence why 11's request, I mean threat, to bring his daughter back is so out of order.

Down here in Neo-Harlem it's none of that. It's all about maximum consumption all the time. Crime & nostalgia & love & hate.

Living like no tomorrow was yesterday. Like the end of the world came and left us behind like bastards on the steps of an abandoned church.

Luckily ppl still want2 find things so that keeps me employed. Luckily 4 them Im really good @ it but maybe not so lucky 4 me this time tho.

I spent the night pondering my next few moves. I knew I needed a Mambo Queen and that meant going Downstairs to Neo- Orleans.

For obvious reasons I'll need a disguise. And a guide who knows her way around...an Eve to lead Adam to the Apple tree.  An Eve indeed!
---End Of Chapter 5---

[Verse 1]
I'll be the one to show you the way
You'll be the one to always complain
3 in the morning come a bang, bang, bang
All out of fags and I just can't wait
Cancel the thing that I said I'd do
I don't feel comfortable talking to you
Unless you got the zipper fixed on my shoe
Then I'll be in the lobby drinking for two

[Chorus]
18, balding, star
Golden fallen heart

[Verse 2]
Look at the shakies, what's with the blush?
Fresh off the plane in my fuzzy rush
Everyone's gathered to idolize me
I hate the way you talk your Japanese scream
It's been too long since I left the shed
You kick the bucket and I'll swing my legs
Always remember the pact that we made
Too young to die but old is the grave

[Chorus]
18, balding, star
Golden fallen heart

[Outro]
I'm a going to show the way
I'm a going to show the way
I'm a going to show the way
I'm a going to show the way

[VISUAL]

You can't live your life on a bus...

EXT. CHURCH PARKING LOT - DAY

A white bus opens its door and a flood of children run off laughing and screaming. After the initial burst, three girls get off laughing. After them, A LITTLE BOY steps off. He's walking slow and somber

All the parents in the parking lot are hugging and kissing their kids. Lots of kids are laughing. The Boy keeps walking until he reaches a black limousine parked at the far end

A chauffeur (old heavyset white guy) stands holding the door open waiting for The Boy

       CHAUFFEUR: Ey! Look who it is
He holds out his hand for a high-five. The kid jumps, hi-fives him, and slides into the limo

The Boy's FATHER (Rick Ross) is sitting by the far door. The limo starts off

The Boy and his father sit in silence for what feels like 8 hours

       FATHER: How was camp?

The Boy "shrugs"

       FATHER (CONT'D): You make any friends?

       THE BOY: No

The father laughs under his breath...but the laugh turns into a smh

       FATHER: Elise made you something special tonight

       THE BOY: Frito pie

       FATHER: I don't know. She didn't say-

       THE BOY (cutting him off): It's Frito pie

Silence. Father stares at him, then looks out the window
EXT. MANSION - DAY

The Chauffeur helps Father out the car. The Boy jumps out and walks toward the front of his home. The Mansion is dope. Very Big, and not gaudy. It looks classic

INT. MANSION - DAY

An infinity pool lines the horizon in the backyard. A spiral staircase fades up the wall and into the master bedroom upstairs. You can see all of this from the foyer, which has a large Buddha statue in the center of it. The place is very clean. Someone seems to care or is paid to care

The Father's phone rings:

       FATHER: Hello

       PHONE VOICE: Hello, this is the Califax collection-

Father hangs up. His cell phone goes off

The Boy walks into the kitchen. It's a big kitchen. There's a chef making food. He waves to The Boy. The Boy throws up a deuce. He gets a s'more Pop tart, then walks back out

INT. BOY'S ROOM - DAY

The Boy walks in and drops his backpack and jacket in the doorway. He kicks off his shoes. They fly across the room, hit the wall, and fall in a pile of shoes on the ground. We see there's a big black/brown stain on the wall where The Boy's been kicking shoes for years. Doesn't look like he ever wears the same shoe twice

The Boy rips the bag of pop tarts open with his mouth as he sits at his desk and opens his laptop. There's a picture of a woman holding a child. She's wearing one of those fly tracksuits from 1995. The ones people wore a lot during the centennial Olympics

He starts checking his mail. His friend "FAM" sent him something that says "this is you" with a link. The Boy clicks the link and a video of a woman blowing a horse comes up. The Boy watches the video for longer than you should watch a horse blowing video. He closes the video
He goes onto HOTNEWHIPHOP.COM. There's a new Rich Homie Quan song out. It's listed as "VERY HOTTTTTTT". The Boy looks in the comment section, reading what people are saying

"This nigga sound like a broke-ass Future! 

[CRYING EMOJI]" is the top comment

The Boy stares. Then types "fuck u niggers" in the comments

He waits. He takes a bite out of his pop tart

He refreshes the page. People immediately respond with "Fuck U", "You wouldn't say that to my face faggot", and "LMFAO crackers b crazy"

The Boy smiles...bec a use the in t e  rnet15 YEARS LATER*******

[PLAY SONG "CRAWL" AT THIS POINT]*******

INT. THE BOY'S ROOM - EARLY MORNING

The room is an elegant mess. There's shit everywhere, but everything has its place. Classic furniture; someone with old money would invest in, is used for the bed, desk, desk chair. You can see from where most of the trash accumulates that the occupant spends most of his time on the computer

There is a pile of stacked and flattened gummy bear wrappers by the desk. There's a picture of The Boy and his father on the boy's desk, along with a flash drive that has "hackz" written on it. A small vaporizer charges and glows green on the edge. There's a half ounce of weed in a plastic bag to the left of the laptop on the desk

There's a black and white Bill Withers poster, a Gorillaz "Demon Days" poster, and a "Black Dynamite" poster. All framed. Stacks of records are placed on a shelf lining the wall. There are some old 70's soul records by a record player on the shelf. Norman Connors "You Are My Starship" is the album on top of the others

Little hills of dirty clothes grow up the walls from the floor. Same pile of shoes is there. Wall with same dirty spot. The closet is filled with white shirts and flower shorts. There's one very old and tattered Shearling coat that hangs to the right

The Boy (more a man now) is sprawled out on his bed, no shirt and flower shorts. He opens one eye as very faint, dark orange sunlight from the blinds cut his face. He gets up

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

The Buddha statue again. There's empty old beer and Pellegrino bottles on the bar. The entire back of the living room wall is glass. The boy walks briskly to the kitchen

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

The kitchen is a slight mess. Things left out. S'mores makings left out. The marshmallows are hard as stones. The boy goes into the cabinet and pulls out a pop tart. He takes out a pop tart and throws it in the microwave, wrapper still on (you're not supposed to do that). He starts the microwave and begins texting someone. The microwave is okay for about 5 seconds, then blue sparks start to pop inside. He turns off the microwave, opens it, grabs the pop tart and tosses it on a plate

EXT. BACKYARD - EARLY MORNING

The Boy walks onto the little island in the middle of the infinity pool lining the oceans and mountains in the background. The mountains are surrounded by clouds. They're literally above the clouds. It's probably raining down there. There's an orchard with lemon and plums to the west of the wall outside, and a green statue of a golfer further in. Bunnies jump on the lawn in the background
The boy sits under a sun umbrella, opens the pop tart and starts to eat it. He looks off with his face flat. He gets a text message:

       FAM: when u wanna paddle out? 

[PURPLE DEVIL FACE EMOJI]

       The Boy texts back: pick me up

CUT TO:

EXT. MANSION FRONT DRIVEWAY - MORNING
An old, red (a gross red. a weak red) Mazda rolls up to the front of the mansion and sputters to a stop. FAM, steps out of the car. Daps up

       FAM: Let's take one of yours

       THE BOY: Nah

       FAM: Really, mane? You want us to drive around in my car? I don't think it'll make it, honestly. It broke down at my mom's. Plus... it looks like my car

       THE BOY: Right. It's inconspicuous

       FAM: My nigga, who are you hiding from? It's not stuttin. It's your car. Why do you even care?

"...why do you even care?"

       THE BOY: Aight

INT. GARAGE - MORNING

The garage door rises to reveal Fam and The Boy's silhouette. Five cars are in the garage. There's a Tesla Model S, Silver 911, some car no one's ever seen, a Tahoe and some car under a tarp. Looks like it could be an Aston Martin. Fam smiles

       FAM (pointing to the car no one's ever seen): That one-
       THE BOY: No
       THE BOY: The Bimmer

We didn't even see this one. It's in the far corner of the garage. It's a nice car. Older, but nice and sleek. Understated, to some. Its black paint is chipping in the front. Fam shakes his head

       FAM: Nah...nah

They get in the 911

CUT TO:

EXT. SANTA MONICA CONDOS - DAY

The 911 pulls up to a nice condo complex. Fam honks the horn for a while. Like a jerk

       SOMEONE FROM A WINDOW: I work nights, dickhead!

       FAM: I know. Fuck me, right?

Fam honks more
The Boy checks his Twitter feed. Twitter name "You Are Unimportant - @thegoldmolar" You can see from his feed he just trolls all the time. Politicians, athletes, entertainers, etc. His favorite was simply re-tweeting something someone says. When it was dumb enough to just re-tweet, that was his favorite. He'd gotten a lot of followers that way. Written an article once for a blog. Got more followers. He started posting videos of homeless people and fights
He was looking for something to retweet on his time-line. People say dumb shit all the time...
...someone tweeted "roscoe's wetsuit"

"...what's that?"

The Boy drops "roscoe's wetsuit" into Google. A Yahoo answer comes up for it. The answer to "what is roscoe's wetsuit?" is..."roscoe's wetsuit". Hilarious

SWANK, STEVE, MARCUS (Chance the Rapper), and AJ (STEFAN) walk out of the condo. They have longboards with them and they're eating candy. They stop in their tracks when they see the 911

       SWANK (re: boards): How we supposed to get these in there?

       FAM: You guys take your car

       STEVE: What about your boards? Where are they?

       FAM: Can we borrow some?

They all make a face

       SWANK: We need a bigger car then. I'ma drive to your house and get the Tahoe

       THE BOY: Come on, guys. This is taking forever

       AJ: Where we going?

       FAM: Dockweiler

       MARCUS: I swam into a diaper last time

       FAM: I'm GRIMEY. I ONLY SWIM IN DIRTY WATERS! YOU KNOW THIS!

       SOMEONE AGAIN: Shut the fuck up!

Fam honks the horn

       SWANK: I'm drivin that Porsche the way back. I know that shit

Swank and Steve walk toward their car parked on the street

       THE BOY: What's "roscoe's wetsuit" mean?

       FAM: I don't know

They drive off

EXT. DOCKWEILER BEACH - DAY

The guys carry the boards through the sand to ocean, making a strange pattern behind them

They setup camp and start changing on the beach

       MARCUS: I thought someone was bringing girls

       THE BOY: No one wants to get up this early

       MARCUS: Did you ask white girls?

       THE BOY: I asked every girl

       FAM: You a lie. You didn't ask anybody. You don't leave the house

       STEVE: Why white girls?

       MARCUS: Cause no one is getting up at 6AM to go into the freezing, dirty ass ocean, fuck up their hair-

At that moment, they all notice a girl sitting on her board in the ocean. Waiting for a wave she looks behind her. She is black

       MARCUS (CONT'D to AJ): See? This is what I mean about Donnie Darko happening to me

A plane flies low overhead. (Dockweiler is right next to LAX)

       MARCUS (CONT'D) (staring at the plane)
It's gonna crush me

       SWANK (re: girl): It's like seeing a mermaid

       STEVE: Maybe it's a manatee

       MARCUS (R. Kelly): I'ma flirt

Marcus runs to the water with his board. They all follow

EXT. OCEAN - MORNING

Marcus swims up to the girl on his board

       MARCUS: Sup

       GIRL: Hi

       MARCUS: I'm Marcus
       SASHA: Sasha
       MARCUS: It's lookin alright today
       SASHA (Australian accent): Yeah. It's the only reason I'm out here
       MARCUS: Oh, you're Australian (pause) You ever seen "Kangaroo Jack"?
       SASHA (not looking at him): Yeah
       MARCUS: Classic
       SASHA: ...wha?
       MARCUS (not mean...just serious): It's a fucking classic

Silence. Sasha is weirded out. All the guys, except The Boy, swim up

       STEVE (to Sasha. Out of breath): Hi. Did Marcus ruin it already?
       SASHA: Yes
Steve splashes Marcus
Swank takes a plastic bag with four blunts in it. He takes one out. He lights up a blunt. Talks with it hanging in his mouth

       SWANK: How long you been surfing?
       SASHA: Ten years. You?
       SWANK: Bouta month
AJ: Cops don't come out here. It's a good place to smoke. You want some?

He passes it. She takes a hit

       SWANK: What you doin tonight?
       SASHA: My friend's birthday in Santa Monica
       MARCUS: Yo, we're right around close. We're having a party tonight in a mansion. You should come. And if your friend's a girl or a guy who has weed, they should come too
       AJ: I'm Djing. I start off with Jodeci, then the switch over to 90's rap using "Dream Lover" to transition, play ACTUAL ATLANTA TRAP for an hour, hour and a half. Then motown, soul, and house. Girls. Go. Crazy
       SASHA: What's your DJ name?
       AJ: Twercules. no "DJ". Just Twercules. I got a tumblr where I post my mixes. It's getting pretty popular. I don't know. You sing? Model? Act?
       SASHA: I'ma go in

Sasha starts paddling and catches a wave into the beach

       AJ: I shouldn't have said "bitches"
       MARCUS (thinks): ...you didn't

AJ thinks on this. This is probably saying more about him than he realizes

EXT. BEACH - MORNING
Sasha carries her board onto the beach. The Boy is sitting there

       SASHA: You goin in?
       THE BOY: Don't know yet
       SASHA: Then why'd you put on your wetsuit?

...roscoe's wetsuit


       THE BOY: Everyone else was
       SASHA: That's an awful reason

She starts walking

       THE BOY: You should come to the party. It'll be fun. (then) They invited you, right?
       SASHA: Where is it?
       THE BOY: 

[EDIT]. Text me 

[EDIT]
       SASHA: I'll remember. I'll bring some friends

She walks off

Later that day:

[PLAY SONG "WORLDSTAR" AT THIS POINT]*******

EXT. I-10 - EVENING
The guys drive down the highway eating In-N-Out. Head nods all around. Swank is now driving the Porsche. Crazily. Fam is with The Boy and the rest of the guys in the other car. Marcus drops his animal style fries on the floor

       MARCUS: Fuck
       FAM: You see you fuckin up this car?
       THE BOY: It's fine
       FAM: He's driving crazy. (iphone goes off) And he's textin me

The text says: R E C K L E S S

       FAM (CONT'D): This nigga's so lame

The Boy sees a tweet of the lead singer of a boy band tweet "follow your heart and 

[HEART EMOJI] all who cross your path!". The Boy retweets it with a 

[LAUGHING/CRYING EMOJI]

       FAM (CONT'D): I gotta stop somewhere first

CUT TO:

EXT. CLUB - NIGHT

[VISUAL]

Fam pulls outside of a club. Lots of people are trying to get in. He and The Boy get out and walk to the bouncer, their friend CHEESE. Fam and Cheese dap. The Boy stands on the side next to a line of people trying get in VIP. They look at each other. He is not dressed appropriately to get in

Fam and Cheese do that handshake thing they do. Fam walks in

Some guys in a black SUV rolls by and yell at the dude next to The Boy

       MAN IN CAR: Dont let me catch you out here Jay! Don't let me catch you!

The Boy watches this for a second. He looks down for a moment...

Someone has spray painted "roscoe's wetsuit" on the sidewalk. He stares at it

       MAN IN CAR (CONT'D): I got yours, muthafucka!

The Boy snaps out of it. Then takes out his phone and starts recording the fight. Fam walks out and sees the fight in action

       JAY (I GUESS?): You scared, bitch! That's why you scared!
       MAN IN CAR: I got something for yo ho-ass my nigga!

POP. POP

..what's happening?

Jay is bleeding from his stomach. The Boy is seeing this through his phone. It takes a moment for him to realize-
POP. POP
...run. now
Fam is already running. Everyone in the line is screaming and running. The Boy runs

       COP: Drop your weapon!

(these are cleaner and succinct) POP.POP.POP

Runs to the side of the building. The SUV that was firing slows down. The driver is dead. Car horn blares as the car slows to a stop, mixing with girls crying and "oh shit!" and "fuck". Jay is very close to dead. The blood on the sidewalk is almost black. A street sign (No parking between 7-9am and 4-7pm) is reflected in the dark blood. He turns to The Boy, looks around. He knows what's happening. He's leaving

That was the end. He'll never read this sentence. Or any sentence. He ended earlier. Before this sentence. As far as he knows, before any sentence. He's back to his/the natural state

The Boy felt something

It's funny, cause this dude is dead. There really isn't a connection...it's more him seeing himself for the first time since-

       SOME NIGGA: Damnnnnn.....!

       HIS FRIEND: WORLDSTAR!

The Boy's phone rings:

       THE BOY: Yeah
       FAM: Get in the car

The Boy turns and sees the car rolling up to the alley he's hiding in. The Boy runs up and jumps in. They speed off

INT. CAR - NIGHT
       FAM: That shit was NUTS!
       STEVE: I knew something was about to happen. I knew it
       MARCUS: Donnie Darko. I'm tellin you

The Boy is looking at the footage on his phone. He's got a death on video. It's looped. Over and over

The Boy touches his shearling coat...there's a hole in it. Bullet hole? He puts his finger through...

...i shouldn't be (here)

He looks at Fam and Steve. They're talking

       MARCUS (CONT'D): Bitches high heels everywhere! They ran out they shoes, cuh

       FAM: BAP! BAP! BAP! Oooow. That nigga lit up

The Boy just keeps watching the video

       FAM: Yo. You got it on video?

       THE BOY: Yeah

       FAM: Wow...you caught the end of his journey on video. That's dope. (then) We gotta pic up Doc from the jazz club

INT. JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT

Fam and The Boy Stand in the back. Doc is on stage playing saxophone with a band. He's doing a solo

       THE BOY: Does it weird you out that you almost died today?

       FAM: Not really. I'm not trippin on death

       THE BOY: I'm not trippin. I'm just sayin, if you think about it, there's no reason for us to be here

       FAM: Doc be hanging with the weirdest people. Look at these niggas. They all look like James Blake. Is that who likes Jazz now?

       THE BOY: I was thinking about it and I can't offer anyone anything. Like, my job is tweeting at people. That's my job

       FAM: That's not your job. You do it cause it's funny. You're rich. We don't have to do anything

       THE BOY: Yeah. Isn't that sad?

       FAM: Sad? We are making moves. What about that line me and Swank are gonna start selling?

       THE BOY: All we did was print shirts for ourselves. Who else is buying that shit? And the whole reason we wanted to make shirts is cause Tre made some and they were dope

       FAM: I don't know what to tell you. We are doing dope shit. We are making moves. We can do whatever we want-

       THE BOY: But none of it matters cause we're doing it for ourselves! We're just jerking off for each other. No one in the future's gonna give a shit I made a shirt once

       FAM: Then don't make a shirt, my nigga

       JAMES BLAKEY LOOKING DUDE: Shhh!

The Boy fiddles with the hole in his jacket

INT. MANSION - NIGHT

All the guys walk in with plastic bags from the grocery store. They have blue cups, alcohol, s'more fixings, and gummy bears

If I was the director, I'd have everyone walk in in slow motion into the house with "Nosetalgia" by Pusha T playing

Walking into bedrooms. Opening drawers. Pulling out bags of weed

CUT TO:

AJ walks into his large closet. Pulls out a bowl. There are some prescription bottles there too

CUT TO:

A naked Marcus steps out of the shower and goes in his closet and pulls out some condoms

CUT TO:

Fam is meditating in the center of his bed. He's floating off the bed by about 4 inchesRAP GENIUS NOTE: This is the end of Part 1, continue on at Part 2

[R. Kelly]
Ladies, it's your boyfriend, I hope ya'll like to do it, like I like to do it

[Hook]

Till the sun comes up
(Oh yeah)
Yo can I hit it till the morning?
(You know it's going down)

Until the sun goes down

We ride, get high, hit clubs

We ball, we bad 

[2x]

[Twista]
What you know about the Mobster Elites, Crucial Conflict and them Do or Die flows
What you know about Kellz & Twist- two multi-platinum artists stepping out the suicide doors
I ain't claiming the crown or the throne, but I know I'm Chi-town to the bone
Come and have a round of Patron and get down to the song while I tell you bout the ground I be on- Chicago
Tell a girl about K-town and the projects, downtown and all these places
Caught her staring at the ice in my ear, she almost fainted when she saw these glaciers
Feel the words when I spit em in the mic, First I gotta get up with the mob in the light
Rollin' 40 deep to the club and I'm like, gotta see what I'm bout to fuck tonight
The party so live, and I'm about to set it off for the 0-5
It's all good but I got the 4-5, and I found me a down ass ho to ride
And she got a fat ol' ass that'll brighten up the room
Come let a West Side nigga slide this dick off in yo womb, Uh huh
Put the dial on her booty make her lively, most likely, she think I'm a make her wifey
Got her hooked like nightly, she wanna bite me, when I come up in the room in a white-tee
Presidential Suite, wit some drank and some kush about to get em on
After dis one night, I'm a be the one you call, when you wanna get a hit until the early mon
Pimp on

[Hook]

[R. Kelly]
Hopping out the fattest cars that money can buy (can buy)
Chick on my side (on my side)
Step off up in the club, 708 repping the Chi (Chi)
I'm at the bar talking to this chic sipping on that magic potion
Trying to get her to let me dive off in that ass like it's an ocean
(Rub her down) with some heated lotion
(And now)got honey soaking
(She's ready) for the pipe
(Fucking with) her emotions
Wanna show you what a true playa's like, you would swear you was in paradise
Wanna turn that ass over and ride, good-bye to them other guys
Girl if you ride out wit me I promise you won't regret it
I shoot hoop and so you know this boy is real athletic
You want me to go down on you baby don't even sweat it
Just pass the Remy to me and watch me get real nasty
R's gonna give it to you how you like it, I'll be bumping on that

[Hook]

[N.A.R.D]
Yo Kellz, take another sip, then another trip buy another fifth (now another bad bitch want me)
Grab another clip, hit it like the trip, represent the pimps (still a lot of platinum on me)
Sit back relax and watch her ride on me, get up in the morning do the same to her homie
Churh right here, muthafucka can't clone me
Louis Vitton, Gucci and Prada, hit it from the back and make her girlfriend hollar
Pimperish but he walk like a scholar, Stack the paper like the almighty dollar
I'm a make it do what it do, you dig?

[Belo Zero]
Well it gotta be (hoes) gotta be (dog) gotta be (dro) gotta be (well) gotta be (club) gotta be (shy) gotta be (long) gotta be (dance)
I was out West at the circle when I met this woman
She was dark-skinned had a shape like a mountain so I know she ain't frying
Put that ass in the back of the jeep and I know she's coming
Says Belo when her toes curl up when I know she's cumming
They supposed to be cumming
I can give you what you want like some dick for days
Belo be a nimpho girl, and I can kiss you where you wanna sex you 3-4 ways
Like ya lips, cheeks, arms, back, middle place
But I gotta stay true cause I'm a realist so I gets paid
Do or Die and Kell

[Intro]
Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I gonna be a star?

[Verse 1]
I tried to be a boy
I tried to be a girl
I tried to be a mess
I tried to be the best
I guess I did it wrong
That's why I wrote this song
This type of modern life, is it for me?
This type of modern life, is it for free?

[Verse 2]
So, I went into a bar
Looking for sympathy
A little company
I tried to find a friend
It's more easily said
It's always been the same
This type of modern life, is not for me
This type of modern life, is not for free

[Chorus]
American Life (American Life)
I live the American Dream (American Dream)
You are the best thing I've seen
You are not just a dream (American Life)

[Verse 3]
I tried to stay ahead
I tried to stay on top
I tried to play the part
But somehow I forgot
Just what I did it for
And why I wanted more
This type of modern life, is it for me?
This type of modern life, is it for free?

[Refrain]
Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I gonna be a star?

[Chorus]
American Life (American Life)
I live the American Dream (American Dream)
You are the best thing I've seen
You are not just a dream (American Life)

[Verse 4]
I tried to be a boy
Tried to be a girl
Tried to be a mess
Tried to be the best
Tried to find a friend
Tried to stay ahead
I tried to stay on top
Fuck it

[Refrain]
Do I have to change my name?
Will it get me far?
Should I lose some weight?
Am I gonna be a star?

[Break]
A- fuck it
A- fuck it
A- fuck it
A- fuck it

[Verse 5]
I'm drinking a soy latte
I get a double shoté
It goes right through my body, and you know I'm satisfied
I drive my Mini Cooper, and I'm feeling super-dooper
Yo, they tell I'm a trooper, and you know I'm satisfied
I do yoga and pilates, and the room is full of hotties
So I'm checking out the bodies, and you know I'm satisfied
I'm digging on the isotopes, this metaphysics shit is dope
And if all this can give me hope, you know I'm satisfied
I got a lawyer and a manager, an agent and a chef
Three nannies, an assistant, and a driver, and a jet
A trainer, and a butler, and a bodyguard, or five
A gardener and a stylist, do you think I'm satisfied?
I'd like to express my extreme point of view
I'm not a Christian and I'm not a Jew
I'm just living out the American dream
And I just realized that nothing is what it seems

[Outro]
Do I have to change my name? (American Life)
Am I gonna be a star? (I live the American Dream)
Do I have to change my name? (American Life)
Am I gonna be a star? (I live the American Dream)
Do I have to change my name?
(American Life) (I live the American Dream)
(American Life) (I live the American Dream)
(American Life) (I live the American Dream)
(American Life)

[Intro: Jermaine Dupri]
This is what you do, this is what you do
This is what you do, this is what you do

[Chorus: Usher]
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Ooh, yeah)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Ooh, baby)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit'
You make me, you make me (Make me, you're makin' me)
Wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Ah, yeah, yeah-yeah)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit'
You make me, you make me

[Verse 1: Usher]
Before anything began between us, you were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to when me and my girl was havin' problems
You used to say it'll be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I'd go home at night and lay my head down
All I seemed to think about was you
And how...

[Chorus: Usher]
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Ooh yeah)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Ah, babe)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit'
You make me, you make me
Wanna leave the one I'm with (Oh, babe)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Come on, come on, come on, come on)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' (Oh yeah)
You make me, you make me

[Verse 2: Usher]
Now, what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowin' it should've been you
And what's sad is that I love her, but I'm fallin' for you
What should I do?
Should I, tell my baby bye-bye?
Should I, do exactly what I feel inside?
'Cause I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together

[Chorus: Usher]
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Oh, ooh, baby)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Say what you do)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' (Ah, yeah)
You make me, you make me
Wanna leave the one I'm with (Ooh, baby)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' (Yeah-hey)
You make me, you make me

[Bridge: Usher]
At this point, the situation's out of control
I never meant to hurt her, but I gotta let her go (Gotta let her go)
And if she may not understand it while all of this is goin' on
I tried, I tried to fight it, but the feeling's just too strong
You make, make, make me (You make me wanna)

[Interlude: (Usher) / Jermaine Dupri]
(Hey) You make me wanna
You make me wanna (Oh)
(Oh, you make, make, make me)
You make me wanna
You make me wanna (Ooh, oh, babe)
You make me wanna (Go on, babe, do your thing)
You make me wanna (Ooh, ooh-ooh yeah)
(Come along wit' it - you're makin' me, you're makin' me)

[Chorus: Usher]
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Oh, ooh, baby)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Say what you do)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' (Ah, yeah)
You make me, you make me
Wanna leave the one I'm with (Ooh, baby)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' (Yeah-hey)
You make me, you make me (You're makin' me)
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (Ooh, you're makin' me, you're makin' me, you're makin' me)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit' (Oh)
You make me, you make me (You make me)
Wanna leave the one I'm with (Wanna leave the one I'm with)
Start a new relationship wit' you, this is what you do (You make me, you make me do)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along wit'
You make me, you make me

Do you know my name?
Do you know my number?
Do you know by summer I will make you a member?
I know you're busy running round with Linda
If I don't get you now then I'll get you by December
You're dancing styles outdated like tinga
It's just a cat, mami snap your finger
I drift in deserts from bumper to bumper
We can rock a dress or we can rock a jumper
You want that pain so I set you on fire
These girls are high but I take you lot higher
So get your beer, it's tiger or Corona
We throw up heat like a bunsen burner
You know my badman style
Cause I'm from Lanka
Eat up a falafel
Say danke danke
If I'm in Street Fighter
I'll be more like Blanka
Roll like a ball and I'll bleed you like a banker

Ow!
Uh-uh, yeah
Ooh, yeah

[Verse 1: Crystal Nicole]
I got a feeling that you 'bout to get it
'Cause baby, I'm killing this dress, boy, get with it
Tonight I ain't playing no more
Boy, I'm staying over
If you're ready, babe, let me know
But don't you wrap me up, babe, if you ain't ready to go
Don't be ticking on my bomb if you ain't 'bout to blow
I'm all in it like I'm playing cards, you all know
So let's go (Woo)

[Chorus: Crystal Nicole]
'Cause I'm a machine, baby
And you got the keys, baby
I'm a machine, baby
And I'm unstoppable
'Cause I'm a machine, baby
And you got the keys, baby
I'm a machine, baby
And I'm unstoppable

[Post-Chorus: Tyrese]
I want your body, baby
I want your body, baby
I wanna tear it apart and rebuild it, baby
I want your body, baby
I want your body, baby
I wanna tear it apart and rebuild it, baby

[Verse 2: Crystal Nicole]
I'm like an engine baby, boy, I'm running
And you got a target on your body I'm gunning
'Cause I got a weapon right here
Ain't no guessing 'round here
'Cause I'm lethal, baby, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Crystal Nicole]
So don't you touch me right there if you ain't ready to rock
Boy, I'm counting on you to hold me like a hands on a clock
Want you loving me harder than this beat, make it knock
So let's go (Woo)

[Chorus: Crystal Nicole]
'Cause I'm a machine, baby
And you got the keys, baby
I'm a machine, baby
And I'm unstoppable

[Post-Chorus: Tyrese]
I want your body, baby
I want your body, baby
I wanna tear it apart and rebuild it, baby
I want your body, baby
I want your body, baby
I wanna tear it apart and rebuild it, baby
I want your body, baby
I want your body, baby
I wanna tear it apart and rebuild it, baby
I want your body, baby
I want your body, baby
I wanna tear it apart and rebuild it, baby

[Chorus: Crystal Nicole]
'Cause I'm a machine, baby
And you got the keys, baby
I'm a machine, baby
And I'm unstoppable
And I'll take you where you wanna go
Christmas time is here again
Christmas time is here again
Christmas time is here again

Ain't been round since you know when
Christmas time is here again
O-U-T spells "out"

This is Paul McCartney here. I'd just like to wish you everything you'd wish yourself for Christmas
This is John Lennon saying, on behalf of The Beatles, have a very Happy Christmas and a good New Year
George Harrison speaking. I'd like to take this opportunity of wishing you a very Merry Christmas, listeners everywhere
This is Ringo Starr and I'd just like to say Merry Christmas and a really happy New Year to all listeners

And Christmas time is all

'94 Roosevelt copped the green card

Me libere, weed inside a cigere
Action Bronson, Bronsoliño, tigere
Taco truck wrap hotter than Serranos
You know the motto, dawg, siempre gano
Mi hermano, got the jugo in the bottle
En el camino, burning rubber, hit the throttle
Life in the fast lane, licensed to flash change
Hyphen the last name, twice when the cash came
Currently I'm moving forward from some past pain
Spit the shit that have us hopping out of glass range
Watch when people get some money how their class change
Cop a crib right by the lake for twenty

Carve initials in the grass, Edward Scissorhands the bushes
Lean on Tempur-Pedic, smoking seven different kushes

Pussy, pussy, pussy
We have black pussy
We have smelly pussy
We have yellow pussy

We back by old timers
And young up-and-comers
Plot in the winter then we storming all up in summer
Fuck the dime piece, I want a deuce or better
I mean the smoke dimes fine when they give a header
Gimme a nine or eight, with a cute face
Appreciate it, shoot game, and roll blue eights
I'm on the J train, BK hop off at Myrtle
I'm on one puff away from Dante's Inferno
But I don't want to burn, unless it's crystalized
Put one high, smoke the pain away, the morning time

Chapter 6: Dressing

She laughed at me at first. I caught her leaving the diner on her way to work.

She stopped laughing when I showed her the high side of a million Units for her troubles if she so volunteered for the task at hand.

Her body was perfect. Her timing was perfect. Everything had a symmetry. It all fit together with no excess. Seamless. I knew better.

This was all somebody's chess. Lotta thought went into it. Big thinking too. Either I'm underestimating someone or they are me.

Either way I'm on the board now and I feel that the games just getting started. She's gonna know somebody that knows somebody. She did.

She's gonna ask for more money. She does. I'm gonna hard nose. I did. She's gonna say "Well baybee you won't cha Mambo Queen or not?" I did.

She's a real looker. She knows. All part of the plan. Beauty & trouble always come together & if the beauty is this big then the trouble...

---Have A Look Inside The Diner Mr. Teriyaki (It's Joe!!)

I look in through the diner window & see people shaking violently & collapsing.
I ask her did she eat anything in there. She says no somewhat startled at the scene taking place back in the diner. I rush in.

The waitresses are motionless, horrified. People grab at their own necks in chaos and last gasps before dropping to the floor lifeless.

---4 Days Mr. Teriyaki...Godspeed---

Son of a bitch. 39 dead. Poisoned. Food Pills. Messy. Poor bastards. Talk about motivation. Shit.

I take Pricele$$ back to my office. She's shook. All kinds of shook. She sits down on the couch and manages to steady herself.

I don't tell her how what just happened @ the diner is connected to our little vacation down to Neo-Orleans or that in the light her eyes...

"What you know about sum Rick Ross?" She motions to the antique poster on the wall. Small talk to take the mind off the massacre.

I like the old school I tell her. Old fashioned. Old music. Old guns. One foot in and one foot out. She remembers something and smiles.

"I like both feet in the pool baybee." She says while pulling two real cigarettes from her small purse. She walks one over to me.

We have a moment. I dont remember lighting it. She's back on the couch now. Wisps of smoke spiral toward the ceiling. Everything is cool.

Next train 2 Neo-Orleans leaves in an hour. Just enough time 2get a proper disguise. A guy could really stick out in a city full of women.

------End of Chapter 6-----

[Intro]
TM, gas
Guwop
I'm the CEO, CFO

[Verse 1]
I rock Giuseppe slipper shoes, got zippers
I'll fuck you out your money, need a rubber for my pistol
My check so big I'll make your breasts get bigger
My neck so wet it make her nut more quicker
And like Scarface, don't touch my sister (Don't touch her)
She a bad bitch but she still my nigga
Saran Wrap city, basement full of Big Tiggers
26s on my charger, Forgi's looking like Jigga

[Chorus]
Gucci coming up, I'm 'bout to blow in one minute (Yeah)
Showtime, 'bout to turn it up in one minute (Burr, burr)
Brick man business, cook a deuce in two minutes (Skurr, skurr)
Eggbeater Gucci cook a deuce in one minute (Skurr, skurr)
How many bad bitches fit in one Bentley?
She's fucking me because she say you cum in one minute
She love me one minute then she hate me next minute
She 'bout to take her clothes off for me in one minute (Guwop)
Girl you gon' be late for work today
I ain't trying to fuck up your business
Eight in the morning, still in it (Still in it)
Let me get one more minute
I'm about to pull out my 'Vert today
Got a drop top Ferrari on skinnies
Spent a half a million dollars one minute
Zone Six, a nigga lose his life in one minute

[Verse 2]
I rock Christian Loubs, rare reptiles on 'em
Five bands for some shoes with some spikes on 'em (Well damn)
My momma praying, say she want me to meet the right woman (Momma)
I'm not prejudice, I'm married to the white woman (Skurr, skurr)
I'm not a rapper turned actor, I'm a dope dealer (Dope?)
Could have been a dentist, touch a lot of throats, nigga (Huh?)
She's got high standards, date ball players (Yeah)
But she still give that pussy to them young niggas (Yup)
You a gold digging baby? I'm a gold digger (Huh)
I'd rather die rich than live like a broke nigga
She a sexy bitch, man, I can't live without her
But I swear, man, it's real hard to live with her
You see this H on my shirt stand for Hermes (Hermes)
Rich nigga, I don't wear Tommy Hilfiger (Nope)
Everybody say a prayer for the Gucci Mane
'Cause he's trying so hard not to kill niggas

[Chorus]
Gucci coming up, I'm 'bout to blow in one minute (Yeah)
Showtime, 'bout to turn it up in one minute (Burr, burr)
Brick man business, cook a deuce in two minutes (Skurr, skurr)
Eggbeater Gucci cook a deuce in one minute (Skurr, skurr)
How many bad bitches fit in one Bentley?
She's fucking me because she say you cum in one minute
She love me one minute then she hate me next minute
She 'bout to take her clothes off for me in one minute (Guwop)
Girl you gon' be late for work today
I ain't trying to fuck up your business
Eight in the morning, still in it (Still in it)
Let me get one more minute
I'm about to pull out my 'Vert today
Got a drop top Ferrari on skinnies
Spent a half a million dollars one minute
Zone Six, a nigga lose his life in one minute

[Verse 1: Drake]
Versace, Versace, Medusa head on me like I'm 'luminati
This is a gated community, please get the fuck off the property
Rap must be changing cause I'm at the top and ain't no one on top of me
Niggas be wanting a verse for a verse, but man that's not a swap to me
Drowning in compliments, pool in the backyard that look like Metropolis
I think I'm sellin' a million first week, man I guess I'm a optimist
Born in Toronto but sometimes I feel like Atlanta adopted us
What the fuck is you talkin' 'bout? Saw this shit comin' like I had binoculars
Boy, Versace, Versace, we stay at the mansion when we in Miami
The pillows' Versace, the sheets are Versace, I just won a Grammy
I've been so quiet, I got the world like "What the fuck is he planning?"
Just make sure that you got a back up plan cause that shit might come in handy
Started a label, the album is comin' September, just wait on it
This year I'm eating your food and my table got so many plates on it
Hundred inch TV at my house, I sit back like "damn I look great on it"
I do not fuck with your new shit, my nigga, don't ask for my take on it
Speakin' in lingo, man this for my nigga that trap out the bando
This for my niggas that call up Fernando to move a piano
Fuck all your feelin's cause business is business, its strictly financial
I'm always the first one to get it, man that's how you lead by example
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Word to New York cause the Dyckman and Heights girls are callin' me "Papi"
I'm all on the low, take a famous girl out where there's no paparazzi
I'm tryna give Halle Berry a baby and no one can stop me

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
God damn, Oh my God
God damn, Oh my God
God damn, Oh my God
God damn, Oh my God
God damn, Oh my God
God damn, Oh my God
God damn, Oh my God
God damn, Oh my God
God damn, Oh my God
God damn, Oh my God
God damn, Oh my God
God damn, Oh my God
God damn, Oh my God
God damn, Oh my God
God damn, Oh my God

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Real nigga movement, young nigga year
Lookin so fresh, you'd thought I was a queer
Feeling like homer simpson drinkin out a beer
Money in the front, with the lean in the rear
Get him out of here, swag of the year
Young Soulja Boy, I went and tattooed all my tears
Damn I had no fears, I feel like a bitch
Shoutouts to Lil B, I'm sitting on my dick
Pull up to the trap, hoes like damn
All this fucking money, bitch I think I'm uncle sam
Tatted on my wrist and my clip don't jam
Soulja Boy Tell Em, in the kitchen cooking yams
Trap goin ham, speakers going hammer
Took your main bitch, then I bammed her and I bammed her
Yeah, I rammed her than I jammed her
Nutted in her mouth
I fucked that bitch in Alabamer

Duct tape, duct tape
Cover his mouth with duct tape
Check a nigga like a motherfuckin update
Where the safe nigga point to it
I catch a case, I wanna know who threw it
And my name, bitches speak fluent
I keep the feds busy
I got the bread, never fed pigeons
Even though I get pissed off I shit on y'all
We gon sip champagne out your skull
I can’t stand these niggas, I’m bout to fall
Got my girl her shoes with the spikes, volleyball
Fuck with Holygrove, it’s gon be a holocaust
Hoes see me shinin, now they actin like a moth

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
My dawg hit me yesterday, got 15 keys
And he gon let em all go for 15 G’s
She said she want a Birkin, I look up like bitch please
And I show that ho a brick like you ain’t tryna flip these
Yeah I’m back nigga, sellin' all these bricks
And if my homies sell you one you better not tell nobody shit
I tell them I’m back nigga, rockin all these jewels
And I be ridin through my hood like I ain’t got nothing to lose, shit
You thinking because I rap I won’t go buy them bricks
Give em to my dawg and let him do all kind of shit
Like take a point out, then put a point in
I fuck yo main ho and all my homies joined in, shit!
I’m getting money, must be the Illuminati
They think I signed up cuz I just bought a new Ferrari
But they said they want my mind, soul and my body
And I looked at that nigga crazy and then I shot him (BAH)

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Today was a good day
I ain’t had to kill nobody

[Outro]
Well Done
Haha

[Hook: Tyga]
Who’s that creepin in my rearview? Niggas better duck round me
Cause I got drama
Chevy with the scrape doors open
Low ridin' on these west side streets, I got drama
Fix that little homie, fix that attitude around me
Cuz I got drama
Put my whole team on, now niggas can’t sleep, fuck beef
Cuz I got drama

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Maniac, Mike gotta kill em
Loose screw with a filler, brainiac, pussy you a rat
We done advance, this a fuckin trap ramp
Park garage and the Cadillac fully automack
Tech sound of the rata tat tat
Bet the beat bang like a beat from battle K
You Sylvester when it come to rap
I put mosaic on the doormat
Kings like I’m reppin sack town
Cut a nigga no slack, fuck that
Nigga I’m ready
And I’m my brother’s keeper, trust no B here but me sir
Jesus let me breathing out this reefer
These demons getting too close, I can see them
See no, hear no evil, I am Caesar
Lookin for a soul, I’m your leader
This is what you wanted, right? (right)
Don’t test me motherfucker, I hold your life

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Get your life before I get it, get your wife before I hit it
Backstabbers in the house with a knife from the kitchen
Cut throats wanna pop my collar
Tryna get close to stop my holla
Dreamkillers shoot you ideas down
Death to the threats the only thing I hear now
Is the money talking like an auction
Spaceship that I'm parking makes me Martian
Caution, I be spending, might be nauseous
Take your bitch to breakfast, give her sausage
Shorty I got drama
No sleeping over here, don't need pajamas
Take everything with you, don't leave no garments
Got a crazy baby momma, don't leave no comments
One time if you creepin', watch them niggas who be peepin'

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Uh, what’s the opposite of satisfaction? You never had it
A sex addict there when you needed it
Now you’re too distracted by the little things, cars, rings, none of it matters
Presidential suites in Nevada, you was too ecstatic
Time tickin', you was 24 karat
Mrs. Hard Headed, don’t listen but the head was terrific, ah
Had a vision, you bought it, couldn't wait 'til you saw it
Swear you had it all, Jordy lost it all and you know it
Know I did it, I'm ridin' round with my new bitch
I'm poppin' bottles and shoppin' and flyin' private to Maui
Livin' life, no excuses, don’t give two fucks about you
You seen my girl ass lately? Now watch me fuck her crazy

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Tell me when to stop, you know I ain't gon' hurt you, babe
Tell me when to stop, but if I start to get carried away
Tell me when to stop, I'ma li-li-li-lick it and go down
Baby, you can get it
Tell me when to stop
Tell me when to stop
Tell me when to stop
Tell me when to stop

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
She said I could take control of her body, but it’s only for the weekend
Said I'ma let you do you, oh yeah, I'ma do you, take you to the room, boom, boom
I make her feel it in her rib cage, roll my weed on it
Just like it’s her birthday, I'm tippin', you sippin', sparklers come with that Ace of Spades
I'm faded, sipping and leaning, I'm faded, sipping and leaning
Sparklers come with that Ace of Spades
I'm faded, sipping and leaning
I'ma fuck you like I'm in a bad mood

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Tell me when to stop, you know I ain't gon' hurt you, babe
Tell me when to stop, but if I start to get carried away
Tell me when to stop, I'ma li-li-li-lick it and go down
Baby, you can get it
Tell me when to stop
Tell me when to stop
Tell me when to stop
Tell me when to stop

[Verse 3: Tyga]
Uh, long hair, red lipstick, lips burned from that cigarette
Versace heels and them latex, neck collar, that that’s a fact
I fuck with you 'cause it makes sense, we don’t fight but this make up sex
Less is more but you more or less, got the top down in my Corvette, yeah
Red from the summer, must've made a wrong turn, checked in a motel just to have sex
Like strangers fuckin' out of anger, puttin' on handcuffs, now a nigga chained up
'Til the maid come clean up, broken mirrors so you know that’s bad luck
Lost my wallet, told you hurry up, pack up, flee the scene, seen a chef just pull up
Shots of tequila, let’s get freaky, lookin' for a reason
By the look in yo' eyes you don’t gotta say much, I can tell that you need it
And you need it just as much as I needed you
Word on streets, I pull work for two, yo' home girl wanna see if it’s true, so just

[Chorus: Chris Brown & (Tyga)]
Tell me when to stop, you know I ain't gon' hurt you, babe (yeah)
Tell me when to stop, but if I start to get carried away
Tell me when to stop, I'ma li-li-li-lick it and go down
Baby, you can get it
Tell me when to stop, you know I ain't gon' hurt you, babe
Tell me when to stop, but if I start to get carried away
Tell me when to stop, I'ma li-li-li-lick it and go down
Baby, you can get it
Tell me when to stop
Tell me when to stop
Tell me when to stop
Tell me when to stop

[Hook: Tyga]
Why you bitches so pressed for?
Open up the gate all I do is press four
Got you pissed off ballin' up your fist for
Don't make me pull out my pistol (bang!)

[Verse 1: Tyga]
It's the hooligan nigga
Eat these rappers up, you just food to me nigga
Rap don't work, I'm a wolverine
Nigga's honey make you desert, wash it down with some liquor
Li-lit up, the pill make a bitch turn flipper
You so um, all on the bottom of my zipper
I Nick trip, got the Cannon on me like Mariah
Pinocchio rappers man, all I see is liars
Rough riders, gang niggas, kush buyers
Get smashed, Halloween, Mike Myers
My religion, plenty women no choirs
They call me the royal penis, their highness
For when they give it up, pour it up, leave it wit' us
Eatin' my dust, you bustas dusty still on the bus
Truly quick, pick her up or you ain't bad, you ain't nothing
All my niggas eatin' like the last supper, nigga

[Hook: Honey Cocaine & Tyga]
Why you bitches so pressed for?
Open up the gate, all I do is press four
Got you pissed off ballin' up your fist for
Don't make me pull out my pistol (bang!)
Don't make me pull out my pistol (bang!)
Don't make me pull out my pistol (bang!)
Don't make me pull out my pistol (bang!)
Why these bitches so pressed for?

[Bridge: Honey Cocaine & Tyga]
Why these bitches so pressed for?
Wh-why you bitches so pressed for?
Why these bitches so pressed for?
Don't make me pull out my pistol

[Verse 2: Honey Cocaine]
Don't make me pull out my pistol
T-Dot that seaside my bitch is official
Get rich or take it cause that is the ritual
This bitch was talkin' I had to turn visual
I don't like to lose it's bad habits
All my bitches loyal and true and all fashion
My niggas holdin' the juice, they all strappin'
Sleepin' on me, hatin me dude I'm straight gassin'
Everything I'm in is luxury
Them other hoes know they can't fuck wit' me
Bitch look me in the face when you stunt on me
Better ask a weak ho try to front on me
Ha-ha, now tell me where that bitch at, that bitch ass
All this good food, I'm surprised I ain't get fat
Wake up then 'urn up then turn up the shit fast
I'm coming through with that pistol you better get back, bitch!

[Hook] + 

[Bridge]

[Bridge: Sage the Gemini]
If we get rowdy, all my niggas solve it
Why you bitches so pressed for
Don't make me pull out my pistol
If we got a problem, all my niggas solve it
Why you bitches so pressed for?
Don't make me pull out my pistol

[Verse 3: Tyga]
Damn!
Hop up in my lap, get high
Pistol grip pump from my lap at all times (times)
Lap at all times, La-Lap at all times
Now it's no more drama, it's that Mary J Blige
Yeah, I'm too high, chinky eyed
Cherry Vans, sweet red, red vine
Closed blinds, nigga you gets no shine
It's my party nigga I ain't standin' in line!

[Hook]

[Verse 1 - Tyga]
500 grand, eat lobster tails
Hoover niggas got work for sale
So much money, no fingernails
Wide body, engine in the tail
Chrome lips, V12
Kiss the king but don’t kiss and tell
So many rings, need a Jordan deal
T-Raww’s, and they all for sale
Just bought a swiss account
Hard to stay the same at this amount
LK, show you what that’s about
Hard to check a nigga when the checks don't bounce
Fuck around, drop out of class
Made millions now, my teacher mad
She need a job and I give her that
Young nigga with big stacks
Buy my style and ain’t gave it back
Who you think brought you the raw rap?
Who you think taught you the phantom rap?
Gold plates, I reflect in that
Every day my birthday, nigga LA my birthplace
This ain’t a race but I’m first place
I never fucked with you in the first place
We on a different pace, nigga so long
I ain’t the nigga you could hold on
Ride the wave or just float on
Get off my back, I’m tryna lead on
Always home when the heat’s on
When it’s cold shoulders niggas be gone
Niggas be gone

[Hook 1 - Tyga]
I’m still the same nigga, same bitches we know
No difference, been me since day one
Real nigga since day one
Cuz I ain’t promised day two
Talkin bout what I’m going through
But who the fuck aksed you?

[Hook 1 - Tyga]
I’m still the same nigga, same bitches we know
No difference, been me since day one
Real nigga since day one
Cuz I ain’t promised day two
Talkin bout what I’m going through
But who the fuck aksed you?

[Bridge - Tyga]
Asked you, asked you
Asked you, asked you
Asked you, asked you
But who the fuck asked you?

[Hook 2 - Tyga]
Who dat be? Who dat be?
Who dat be? That’s me bitch
Who dat be? Who dat be?
Who dat be? That’s me bitch
Niggas wanna talk, don’t cross the line
I murder them motherfuckers every time
Niggas wanna talk, don’t cross the line
I murder them motherfuckers every time

[Verse - Tyga]
It’s a thin line between love and hate
A thin line between real and fake
Keep a nigga based on shape, ass shake
She gon make it clap, vibrate
Give me room, 50 feet, all in my space
I’m the one you face and don’t hesitate
See me layin on yo back, man eat this shell like it’s Pac mane
Do it under one tape, what you say?
T-Raw to blame, T-Raw to blame
Got a piggy bank, pretty model sittin next to me – that’s accessory
Don’t be sassin me
How do you have the audacity?
Want a verse gotta bring cash to me
I be gassin me, you wanna crash on me?
Have yo head where yo feet should be
Laid out in yo living room, murder you then watch it on TV
Ain’t no breaking me, breaking news that’s me
Headline, we can go head up
Like Greenbay Packer, hell lit, hell yea
He a crazy ape man, I’m turnt up to ten
Fuck with me, commence and repent
Mill to the king
Came from the block, little hardknock
Lock it up, pull me in a cell block, I can make it
You ain’t made shit, you complainin (stop complainin)

[Hook 2 - Tyga]
Who dat be? Who dat be?
Who dat be? That’s me bitch
Who dat be? Who dat be?
Who dat be? That’s me bitch
Niggas wanna talk, don’t cross the line

Niggas wanna talk, don’t cross the line

[Chorus]
Ahww, T-Raww, Young Kobe

Got white bitches like Young Kobe
Got spanish bitches hey Young Kobe
My purple-yellow nigga Young Kobe

T-Raw, Young Kobe
No assist, make the city holy
Put you on blast, these bitches love me

Choppa mack til you macaroni
Got that mack game, gotta admire homie
You passed a hole, bitch you a bogie
Pussy feel good, Tony told me
Hoes sued me, you be left in line
Shoot do home movies, fuckin' half the time
Killa, face, hunned, thousand, she be straight, 3-45
I’m never late on CP time

I might pop on you, watch you 9 to 5
Give you hard 9 and make you quit yo job like

[Pre-Chorus]
Who that? Who that? Who that nigga?
In a blue cap, Maybach, blueray coupe back
Tell me where they do that, shoot that, shoot back

Tonight’s the night, I’m letting niggas know wussup

[Chorus]
Ahww, T-Raww, Young Kobe

[Verse 2]
Nigga you don’t know shit
From a can of paint, with a nigga thing, put LK on a blank
Now a nigga think he me

Pyramids and homicide descriptions, all hail this 20 vision
Sip on the selections, get embodied by my spirit, get money on templates, I’m lifted
Stick with it, dog on my own
Fuckin I’m tryna bone, knockin at my front do
Leave me the fuck alone, I’m blowin home grown
It’s big money on my phone
Cellular, selling dreams for a prettier
Bad bitch to me, fuck you if you ain’t finna heard

Dude you move like a beginner

[Pre-Chorus]
Who that? Who that? Who that nigga?

[Outro]
Nigga you don’t know shit
From a killing pain, with a nigga thing, put LK on a blank
Now a nigga think he me
Nigga you don’t know shit
Pyramids and homicide descriptions, all hail this 20 vision
Sip on the selections, get embodied by my spirit, get money on templates, I’m lifted

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Hold up, money talk so you know what?
Ain’t nothing to talk about, you ain’t got enough cuz
Rock star drugs break a bitch heart, no love
Emma Watts, Charlie Sheen, fuckin' with no scrub
Niggas want connects, got no plugs
Nigga say they high, got no buzz
Popsicle niggas wanna talk shit then say you froze up
Young niggas wanna pop pills, just po up
Went on a bang, Went on a bang
Bitches came for me and my nigga eazy
Threw that bitch out, got that ho one way
Said she tryna stay, told that bitch no way
That’s a preme nigga, B ripper, grim reaper
I don’t get mad bitch, I just get even
T-Raw magician, I don’t gotta trick or treat it
That Ferrari California make a bitch a believer

[Chorus]
Million dollars’ worth of cars, all paid out
See you niggas hatin, had to pull my chains out
Make it rain even when it’s rained out
Turn up, bang out
Bang out, bang out
Turn up, b-bang out
Million dollars’ worth of cars, all paid out
See you niggas hatin, had to pull my chains out

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Met a bitch last night, won’t believe it
Fuck her so hard, bitch probably stopped breathing
Killed the pussy, in the hotel screamin
Knock knock, going in like the housekeeper
The room, keep it
I fucked now I don’t need it
T-Raw semen splattered on a bitch beaver
Pipe dreamin, fuckin with a real baller
The bitch is a bitch so I’m gon call er
Then they act up, call the backup
Don’t matter, as if she ever mattered
Bitch shut up, throw it up, I throw the set up
Tell her sit up, got her face down, bitch don’t put yo head up
Yea, bitin on er ear
Got a old bitch, pussy like souvenir
I hop up in it, nigga I ain’t never scared
Closet full of straps and the condom right here
What I got?

[Chorus]
Million dollars’ worth of cars, all paid out
See you niggas hatin, had to pull my chains out
Make it rain even when it’s rained out
Turn up, bang out
Bang out, bang out
Turn up, b-bang out
Million dollars’ worth of cars, all paid out
See you niggas hatin, had to pull my chains out

[Verse 3: Eazy-E]
Beef on the street, to the beach I be rollin
Never see me strollin, 40’s I be holdinGirls in the daisies, drive easy crazy
Rolled up my windows as I turned on my AC
Rollin down Crenshaw, see the hoes jockin
Sunday nights poppin, see the foes hoppin
My stereo’s bumpin that ATL funk
You can call it what you want
Either way the shit bump
I’m a evil motherfucker ready to tear shit up
I’mma put these things on you and never let up
See my mama, she was home when I was born
Bet a nigga like to eat shit than never been born
But I ain’t going out unless 30 niggas die
I’m dyin anyway so I’m thinkin suicide
Shut the fuck up nigga cuz you ain’t seen shit
I’m bout to take this blade and straight up rip

[Outro: Ice Cube]
A bitch is a bitch
So if I’m poor or rich
I talk in the exact same pitch
Now the title of bitch don’t apply to all women
But all women have a little bitch in em

[VISUAL]

The Boy lies, arms to his side, on his bed, looking at the ceiling

Spiders slowly drop from single strands of web from all the posts on the bed. It looks pretty. All of them dropping simultaneously swaying together. They whisper:

......where are you?
................who is this?
...don't slide

It's almost a song

*******

[PLAY SONG "THE WORST GUYS" AT THIS POINT]*******

INT. MANSION - NIGHT

More people are at the house. People drinking and smoking. Shoes off. It's a Temple. Respect it
The back wall of the living room has been pushed into the wall, so there's a seamless transiting from living room to backyard patio

People sit on the swings underneath space heaters

EMILY is in the middle of the pool table. Swank plays pool around her. RUBEN is filming Marcus and Steve throwing things in the fire pit

AJ is djing in the middle of the living room

Some guy is running through the living room in just a towel. He is dripping water. He almost slips

The projector room (theatre) is playing Fight/Vine compilations. Two dudes are in there not watching. Just smoking

The Boy walks through the backyard. There's a dude and a girl making out on the bar outside. They're sitting on the bar

       THE BOY: Don't sit on that

They look at him. He stares back. They get down. He walks away. They stare as he leaves. The Boy walks to the edge of the pool and looks at the ocean go into the sky

       THIS KID IN A HAT (laughing/whisper): Hurry!

This kid in a hat and his friend are running out the front door with an iPad and a midi controller. The Boy walks inside. Marcus stops him. He's out of breath and looks wet

       THE BOY: Some guys just stole some stuff

       MARCUS: Please tell me you saw that Argentinan...Argentinian? Argentina-girl. I can't say it-
       THE BOY: Stop inviting random niggas in here. If you don't know their names they can't come

       MARCUS: I don't hear you right now. I just fucked in a steam shower and I feel CRAZY. It's like I came in a Prince video. I like, blacked out. Couldn't breath in there, mane. I- (wait) Fuck! Is she still in there? You think she's okay? (He thinks)

       THE BOY: You're the Florida of my friends

The Boy walks away

INT. FATHER'S ROOM - NIGHT

The Boy walks up to the door. Before he can open it, Sasha opens it from the inside. She's with another girl. It feels like they just did a drug or were stealing something themselves

Sasha sees The Boy. Startled. Then she smirks

       SASHA: Come in! Quick!

[VISUAL]

She pulls him in. The other girl flops on the bed

       OTHER GIRL: UUUUUGGGGHHHHHHH. SOOOOO SOOOOOFFFFTTT

       SASHA: Hurry, hurry, hurry. Scoot, scoot

The Boy lays against the wall. Sasha sits on the bed
Silence. Then:

       SASHA (CONT'D): Show us your dick

       THE BOY: Wha?

       SASHA: Do it. Show it

       OTHER GIRL: Ew

Silence

       THE BOY: Ha

Silence

       THE BOY (CONT'D): Why?

       SASHA: Cause it's probably gross and I wanna laugh at it

       OTHER GIRL: I've never seen a black dick. Is it purple?

       SASHA: Grape dick

       OTHER GIRL (agreeing): Grape dick

Sasha gets up and starts to punch The Boy playfully. The other girl is laughing crazy

       SASHA: Do it. Don't be weird!

       OTHER GIRL: Let's be weird a little!

The punches slowly stop. Then Sasha starts kissing The Boy. You can't see below their waist, but stuff is going on. Then stuff stops

       SASHA: What's wrong? This is weird?

       THE BOY: No

       SASHA: You don't want to? This is weird?

       THE BOY: No. I want to

       SASHA: Then...what's going on, chum?

       THE BOY: Hold on

The Boy plays with his dick. Nothing. It's like gum

Silence. Fidgeting. Sasha's got a 

[ASHAMED EMOJI] look on her face

       THE BOY (CONT'D): Hold on

He walks into the bathroom and closes the door. Locked. Silence. Sasha sits on the floor

       OTHER GIRL: What's up?

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

The Boy sits on the floor. Head in hands

Damn, guy

The Boy's ex-girlfriend steps out of the linen closet

[VISUAL]

       VANESSA: What are you doing?

       THE BOY (head in hands): Chillin

       VANESSA: In the Bathroom?

       THE BOY: Mmm-hmm

       VANESSA: Well, I want to go out

       THE BOY ("no"): Mmm-mmm

Vanessa playfully throws things from the counter at him (toothbrush, cup, floss, soap). He throws some of it back. She starts laughing. He pulls her to the ground with him

       VANESSA: Why are you so moody?

       THE BOY: I'm not. Let me enjoy this for a second

       VANESSA: We can do this outside, 

[EDIT]

       THE BOY: We could live the rest of our lives here. There's a TV in the mirror. There's fresh water every time we flush. I heard they're building a sandwich place in the shower

Vanessa smh and smiles

       VANESSA: Get up. We're going

       THE BOY: Come 'on-

       VANESSA: I mean it!

She pulls him up. She opens up the linen closet and pulls The Boy in

Coachella is inside the closet

There are people saying things, giving opinions, feeling interesting. Everyone has a purpose today. It's a great time

The Boy chases after Vanessa and catches her. He carries her for like three steps, then they walk together, holding hands

       VANESSA (CONT'D): We have to see everything together. I don't wanna split up this time. We each get to choose one band the other one can't make you see- (then) What's wrong?

       THE BOY (smh): ...

       VANESSA (disappointed): Really?...You're really doing this to me? Right now?

       THE BOY: You don't think this is a waste of our time?

       VANESSA: No, I don't think me and you together is a waste of time. That's what you think. And I'm tired of trying to convince you otherwise. At least be a man and break up with me instead of telling me I don't like you

       THE BOY: But you don't! You don't really like me. I just look good when you scroll past me with the rest of your "I'm almost Vashtie" bullshit

[NO MOUTH EMOJI]

       VANESSA (teary whisper): You're so mean

       THE BOY: I'm trying to be honest

       VANESSA: Mean doesn't mean honest! Honest can mean mean. But only if you mean it

       THE BOY (so many "means"): Wait...the-

       VANESSA: I'm trying so hard with you. But I'm not gonna carry us. I won't waste your time anymore

She starts walking away. Then she looks to the sky and shoots up like a rocket
She looks like a shooting star in the sky. Not a sound is heard while this happens. They never see each other again

Then the coyotes come out

They're glowing blue. They're circling and they're talking about music

       WOLF 1: What'd you think of 2 Chainz' set?

       WOLF 2: It was really fun. His live shows have gotten way better. I saw him last spring in Chicago

       WOLF WITH GLASSES: Have you heard that Roc Marciano album on vinyl? It's so good, man

       MESSY, BUT COOL WOLF: You guys, this is my fiance, another wolf. He or she works in a small music or graphic design for niche clothing or this app I'm building

They rip The Boy to shreds while they talk. Blood everywhere. The Boy doesn't make a sound. Lets it happen

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

The Boy realizes he is pacing in the shower. He's been in there for a minute, cause the water is cold

He opens the door. The girls are gone. The small clock on the desk says "5:23 AM". There's also a note written in lipstick on the mirror that says "YOUR FUCKED" (smh at the "your"). Probably Sasha. She's probably right

CUT TO:

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The house isn't totalled, just dirty. Empty cups, bottles, cigarette butts, etc. The Boy sees Steve and Swank passed out on the couch

       THE BOY: Let's go guys

       STEVE (waking up): Where we going?

       THE BOY: Oakland

       SWANK: When's the flight leave?

       THE BOY: We're driving

       SWANK: Wha? (then) How'd we get poor?

INT. FAM'S ROOM - NIGHT

Fam's sleeping. There's a naked girl sleeping with him. The Boy comes in

       THE BOY: We're going

The Boy leaves. Fam opens his eyes

[PLAY SONG "TELEGRAPH AVE." AT THIS POINT]*******

EXT. MANSION - NIGHT

Swank, Steve, and Fam are asleep in the car. The Boy sits down in the driver's seat

       He pulls out his phone and texts someone named NYALA:

Im driving up now

...(that moment you know exactly what they're typing and how they look doing it)
       She writes back: DONT

The Boy looks at this. Then starts up the car and turns on the radio and speeds out of the driveway

A moment passes...

Then we see the girl that was in bed with Fam walk out in the Mansion doorway

       THAT GIRL FAM KNOWS FROM THAT ONE PLACE: Fam?

EXT. I-5 - NIGHT/EARLY MORNING

Everyone's asleep in the car except The Boy who's driving (AJ is there too. They picked him up.). Lloyd's "Oakland" is playing on the radio. The Boy turns it up so he feels like he's in a video. He pushes his seat back so he can lean

       SWANK: Ow, ow!

He slammed Swanks knees. Sorry

The Boy speeds through the empty highway. It's really pretty. I'm not sure what those factories are in the middle of nowhere with all the lights on them. They're probably horrible for the earth, but they look really magical at night. He passes one of those factories

There's a lot of rolling hills. Lotta farms. There's a slaughterhouse. Smells and looks grey and awful. All the cows look really sad. Maybe I'm just making them sad. Maybe they're fine

Looking at the rows of crops criss-cross on farms as they pass

There's a billboard. It says: ROSCOE'S WETSUIT

The Boy stares at it. Just a white billboard with "roscoe's wetsuit" on it

EXT. MIDDLE OF NOWHERE IN-N-OUT - DAY

The guys are sitting on their car, eating burgers at the far end of the parking lot

As The Boy bites into his double-double he thinks about the slaughterhouse. Then he looks at his burger. He laughs

Two women walk out. They look like they're in their late 30s. Swank spots em. One of the women is wearing a Northwestern hoodie

       SWANK (re: hoodie): Long way from Chicago

       WOMAN 1: Alumni

       SWANK: There's no way. You can't be over twenty-three

The women just smirk and close their doors. They drive off

       SWANK (CONT'D): See that? Johnny Appleseed of confidence, man. Just leaving little seeds with everyone

A car crazily pulls up next to the In-N-Out. Two dudes jump out with masks and guns

       FAM: Daaammmmnnn

They run inside. We see people running in their cars, and driving off. All of our guys stay seated on their car. Just eating

A minute goes by. No gun shots. Just yelling

The two dudes run out. Just as they do, you can hear the police coming

       ROBBERY DUDE 1: MOVE, RYAN!

       AJ: This nigga's using his real name. Treated

       STEVE: Could be a code name

       AJ: That's definitely his real name. No one's robbery name is "Ryan". It's something like..."Snake-Man"

They all make a face

       AJ (CONT'D): Fuck ya'll. I wouldn't rob a place with ya'll pussy ass anyway

The Police roll up. Ryan tries to get away, but they pin him. The other dude shoots at the cop

       FAM: We should leave. They're shooting at the cops. Which means the other cops coming give a fuck 'bout bystanders now

       MARCUS (in anchorman voice): Two men were arrested in an attempted robbery at an In-N-Out burger today. (mumbling) Also some niggers ended up dead, we don't know. This is news, people!

       STEVE: After being frisked, the dead suspects somehow got guns and shot themselves in the head even though they were handcuffed and in the back of a tiny-ass squad car

       THE BOY: Police chief states: "no investigation needed"

       STEVE: "White people still safe!"

They laugh. As they start to drive off

Suddenly two cop cars screech in front of them

       COP 1: HANDS IN THE AIR!

       STEVE: Fuck

All of the guys put their hands up

CUT TO:

EXT. OAKLAND STREET - DAY

Everyone looks a little bummed. Silence. More silence

       THE BOY: We're here

They pull over to a row of brownstones

       MARCUS: Great. Why are we where is this?

The Boy gets out of the car and walks up to the door. As he's about to knock, the door opens. Nyla is standing there. Her face is a mix of anger and strange

Sympathy. Like she refused to cry like...an hour ago?

       THE BOY: Hey-

       NYLA: There's a point you reach when you're no longer able to feel like you did. Not about a person, not with a certain place, you just can't feel like you did because that muscle or whatever is just...dead. Or gone

       THE BOY: Hi, Nyla

       NYLA: When you're alone, you might be able to remember it. You might even hear a song that makes you question it. But you don't have it. It doesn't exist anymore. It's dead. Do you understand?

       THE BOY: Yes. Absolutely. But Nyla-

       NYLA: I AM AT THAT POINT, 

[EDIT]

Tears. She's not crying. She's just that mad

A dude pokes his head out from the hallway in the brownstone. The Boy and him make eye contact

       THE BOY: This isn't what you think it is. I didn't come here to...look, I saw this dude die and-

       NYLA: And you're scared. So you came here

       THE BOY: I'm not scared. I just wanna be with someone
Who knows me for a little

       NYLA: I don't know you. We're not together. I have company. Go home

       THE BOY: Okay, you're being mean now

       NYLA: "Mean?" Who cares? You're an adult. Also, you embarrassed me

       THE BOY (to the dude in the hallway): We were planning on having a kid together. She offered and we had a whole plan. Like adults or something. Then I backed out. So... (then) You're second at best is what I'm saying

The guy goes -__- 

[SIDE EYE EMOJI]

       NYLA: What is wrong with you?

       THE BOY: I don't know

       NYLA: Me neither

This is really sad for both of em. They really wanna know. Nyla closes the door

       NYLA (CONT'D through the door): Please grow up
The Boy stands there...then Swank walks up to him on the stoop of the brownstone

       SWANK: Can I use her bathroom? That double-double's makin moves

The Boy walks away and gets in the car. Swank stands there for a moment. Then tries to cut off a fart with his hand as he walks to the car

INT. OAKLAND CLUB - NIGHT

The guys sit at a table in the corner. The Boy is sitting in the corner. Fam is texting. Swank and Steve are talking to two girls. A promoter walks over

       PROMOTER: Ey. You gonna just sit here

       THE BOY: Yeah

       PROMOTER: Well, you gotta order something

       THE BOY: A bottle?

       PROMOTER: Yeah. A bottle

They stare

       THE BOY: I'll take 12 bottles

Promoter gives him a 

[NO MOUTH EMOJI]. The Boy just stares at him...he's serious. The promoter walks off

CUT TO:

Twelve girls with bottles and sparklers emerge around the club from the back. It's a parade. They curve around the club making a big to do. People are staring, like "is Diddy here? OMG Diddy's here!"

The parade gets to the top of the stairs where the booth is. But when they turn the corner, the guys are gone already. There's a stack of cash sitting in the middle of the table

The promoter stands there

INT. DINER - LATE NIGHT

[VISUAL]

The guys are eating

       SWANK: But animals eat animals, man. Animals!

       STEVE: The argument is that we've been given the freewill and understanding of life. So we shouldn't because the option is there for us

       SWANK: Man, in Nigeria they made me AND my little brother slaughter a goat. We raised that goat, man. I loved that fucking goat. And one day we came home from school and they just handed us the knife. I've seen the blood man. I've heard the screams. I still ate the shit though


...I was here before


       THE BOY: We were here before

       FAM: What?

       THE BOY: We've done this before

       FAM: Nah man. This is our first time together in Oakland

       THE BOY: This is every night. This is all the nights, man

       FAM (weirded out): Nahhhh. We switch it up, man

The Boy stops listening. Across the way there's a group of kids eating in a booth

They're laughing and talking behind the back of a friend they don't seem to like very much. One of the girls is going in. But behind her, there's a guy in a colorful faux 90's hat. He's writing something on the wall in sharpie

He's writing "roscoe's wetsuit"

The Boy gets up and walks over

       THE BOY: Excuse me. What does that mean?

       HAT KID: What?

       THE BOY: Roscoe's wetsuit

       HAT KID: Oh. I don't know

       THE BOY: Yes you do

       HAT KID: Wha?

       THE BOY: You know what it means. Tell me

       HAT KID: I don't know. I saw it online

       THE BOY: So you just write shit you see?

       HAT KID: Fuck's your problem?

Fam walks up. Grabs The Boy

       FAM: Ey. Let's just eat

The Boy and Fam sit

       HAT KID: It means I sat on your mom's face

The Boy SLAMS his fist on the table. It's loud. Everyone in the diner looks at him. The Boy doesn't look up

       THE BOY (quiet): Tell me what it is or I'll cut you open and take the answer

Silence

The guys roll up to the front of the hotel

[OPEN MOUTH EMOJI]

       FAM (to The Boy): You good?

Boy doesn't say anything

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
The guys walk in the lobby. There's an Indian wedding happening. They're probably not called Indian weddings. It's probably just a wedding, but all the people participating happen to be Indian. There's a bunch of guys talking and quietly laughing in the hall. The door to the banquet room is open as they pass. The Boy stops. The bride and groom are slow dancing. The Bride is quite pretty. Green eyes and dark skin. She's got the aura of a business woman. Probably met him at Stanford and was like "this is reliable". The groom looks like a caricature of a good ol' fashion white dude

       STEVE: Good for him

       SWANK: Nah. He don't get any interracial points. He's just doing what white guys been doing since forever. Exactly what he wants

       AJ: Really? Like that?

       SWANK: Man, I used to get so pissed when girls would watch Boy Meets World and be like "Ryder Strong's so dope for having a black girlfriend". Man, fuck that nigga

       AJ: Come on, man. My dad's white and his parents didn't like my mom. They just started talking again

       SWANK (over the top): Oh you're poor white dad! (then) Nigga, shut up. Take that team light skin shit outside

       THE BOY: I've never seen one of these

       FAM: A first dance?

       THE BOY: A wedding

       FAM: Yeah. (then) Marriage is so wack. I mean, I get it. But come on, yo. Forever? ("Ms. Jackson") Forever, ever? Forever, ever?

       THE BOY: You think either of them don't wanna do it?

       FAM: Mane, I bet both of em are like that

       THE BOY: They look happy as fuck though

       FAM: Cause they reached their goal. In a year they'll
Be like "oh fuck...goals are dumb."

       MARCUS: Goals are dumb?

       FAM: Making your life a goal is dumb. I think. This shit is supposed to be just fun. (then) I took an edible at the diner. It's kickin in. Hard. I'mma go upstairs

       THE BOY: Okay

They both stand there for a moment

       FAM: I'm gonna need some help

AJ takes Fam by the arm

       FAM (CONT'D): There we go

They head to the elevators

       MARCUS: I'mma look for some bridesmaids

He walks off

       STEVE (yelling to Marcus): Gee-van-chi!

       MARCUS (calling back): Nigga, god bless you

       STEVE (to The Boy): What you doin?

The Boy stares at the couple

       THE BOY: I'mma stay down here

       SWANK: You good?

       THE BOY: I'm great

They Kanye shrug, then walk off to the bar. The Boy walks into the banquet

INT. BANQUET HALL - NIGHT

The lights are low. Most of the people have gotten up to pee or something. The Boy just stares at the couple. Then he decides to start recording. A man comes up to him

       OLDER INDIAN DUDE:Who are you here with?

       THE BOY (not looking up from his phone): The groom. We went to college together

       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: Oh. (then) Nice isn't it?

       THE BOY (sincere): Beautiful

       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: When the buddies start getting
Married, that means you're next

       THE BOY: I don't think so

       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: That's what everyone says. That's what I said thirty years ago

       THE BOY: I don't believe in marriage. (then) Maybe that's not true. But I am against it

       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: What do you believe in?

       THE BOY: Cool baby mamas

       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: Ahhhhh. But how many women you know are interested in your concept?

       THE BOY: More than you'd think. I find if you have a job and are actually interested in raising a child, women, who are a little older, tend to be responsive. I just don't think they like being labeled that. (then) Do you get tired of it?

       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: Of marriage?

       THE BOY: Of marriage. Of her. Of yourself

He thinks

       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: Yes. Sometimes

       THE BOY: Then why?

       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: I had to man-up. It was time. I
Don't regret it

       THE BOY: Well I don't have to man-up. I did what I'm supposed to do. I found the things I'm good at. I didn't get anyone pregnant on the way there. And I've had mature relationships that prepared me for what marriage is

       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: Mature relationships?

       THE BOY: Yeah. I keep in touch with all my exes. We're all friends

       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: You still call them

       THE BOY: I send em a happy birthday text or DM 'em

       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: That's not a friend. I do that with my boss. And I hate my boss. (to himself) Fuckin Korean kid thinks he know everything

Silence

       OLDER INDIAN DUDE (CONT'D): What do you do?

       THE BOY: I troll celebrities, politicians, or anyone with large enough online cache until I get a response. I post those responses and/or convos on my blog. And I charge gossip blogs and advertisers to advertise on my site and sometimes me and my friend put out novelty books of fucked up things we find online while digging up dirt on said celebrities and/ or politicians and sell it to niche book stores or larger stores that fit our aesthetic

The man just stares, not understanding

       THE BOY (CONT'D): How old are you?

       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: Fifty-three

       THE BOY: I'm like Bill O'Reilly

       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: Oh

The older man leaves. A shlubby man in a suit comes to the podium in front. People clap for the end of the dance

       MAN IN SUIT: I've known Safia and Greg since college and I honestly knew this day would happen since we were getting high in my dorm room junior year at GW. (to mom) Sorry Mrs. Healey, Greg smokes weed. You gotta deal!

Everyone laughs

       MAN IN SUIT (CONT'D): But honestly, may you two spend the rest of your lives healthy and happy

"Awwww"

       MAN IN SUIT (CONT'D): And now, the traditional "march to forever" to bless the bride and groom with happiness for all their days to come

Everyone claps

[VISUAL]

Little creatures slowly start to march out from the kitchen. Some have banners that say "HAPPY MARRIAGE!". Some have sparklers. They all bounce on beat. It's cute for a very short moment. Then it feels wrong

All the creatures have two legs, two arms, like humans.  But they are definitely not humans. One of the giveaways being that they are naked, but don't seem to have genitals

All the creatures are breathing heavy out their mouths (their noses being two tiny slits probably don't allow for heavy air traffic)

They're about three feet high. Their eyes are larger than they should be and are spread farther on their faces. They don't have hair anywhere on their bodies. They all have forced smiles on their faces. You can see their teeth are just a little too sharp when they smile. Insinuating carnivorous behavior. If they wanted to, at any point they could jump on you and rip out your throat in .8 seconds. But they're not right now. They're marching
One of the creatures has tears in its eyes. Still smiling tho. Pushing the smile

Everyone is smiling as they march past, but they're all very cautious. Clearly worried that one may attack. The Boy watches as the creatures reach the front of the party and form a circle. They do this weird clapping, almost step team routine, then stop. The music stops

       CREATURE 1: We did it!

       CREATURE 2: Yay!

Everyone claps. The bride and groom force a smile. The creatures slowly make their way back to the kitchen. All that's heard is their struggled breathing and clammy skin hitting the wooden dance floor. One stares at The Boy as he (or she) leaves

...that was unacceptable.

If you save yourself for marriage, you're a bore
If you don't save yourself for marriage, you're a horrible person
If you won't have a drink, then you're a prude
But they'll call you a drunk as soon as you down the first one

[VISUAL]
This is the part where they kinda fall in love a little bit. But I feel like anything we put here wouldn't do justice to what really happens when a person you meet ends up in your life out of nowhere. But know that it's exactly how you expect it to be, but also more. It's a big inside joke that you can't mess up and only one other person in the world gets

It's not a very pretty or perfect love, or even necessarily a romantic love. It doesn't look cool.  It's more like two helpless things in the wild, and one says "I'll protect you", and both parties know it's a lie because there's no way either of them can protect the other from anything. That lie is the best way to describe this love. That feeling of not having to say "I'm scared", because you share the exact feelings without having words over or under complicate it, that's worth more than protection. It's a connection. The less alone. This is all we look for on earth

The Boy and Naomi hang a lot. They spend the night and make breakfast sometimes. He buys stuff for her. She makes him stuff. They watch cartoons together. They're always saying things, giving opinions, feeling interesting. They both have a purpose. It's a great time. Time passes

The Boy starts moving small amounts of weed out the mansion, but starts selling more to keep up, along with stuff that isn't weed. He started growing crop in the nursery. The electricity bill would be high, but he stopped living in the mansion. He started renting another place to stay and keep the business separate

To be honest it was getting a little out of hand, as Naomi predicted. The Boy is not a good dealer. A lot of people think you have to be cold and calculated, which he was to an extent. But you also have to know people. How they act/react. But it was still kinda fun up to this point

Then:

INT. RENTAL HOME - DAY

The Boy is washing dishes as Naomi stands next to him. They just had lunch

       NAOMI: Howbout'sm China, IL?
       THE BOY: Can't

       NAOMI: Can't why?

       THE BOY: I got a run to do

       NAOMI: Oh

Silence

       NAOMI (CONT'D): I thought you were having other guys do that now

       THE BOY: I am. Fam can't do this one

       NAOMI: If you're putting up the money you shouldn't be making the run

       THE BOY: I don't really trust anyone else to do it

       NAOMI: You don't really trust anyone

       THE BOY: I trust you

       NAOMI: You shouldn't

The Boy stops. She got em
       THE BOY: You're right

       NAOMI: I don't want to be right. I wanna help you

       THE BOY (said dumb): "I don't wanna be right"

She doesn't laugh. He hopes she's LOLing inside. Cellphone vibrates on the counter across from them. The Boy goes over and reads the text

       THE BOY (CONT'D): I gotta go

       NAOMI: Alright

       THE BOY: You okay?

       NAOMI: I'm fine

       THE BOY: Is that a fake "I'm fine"

       NAOMI: No. It's what "I'm fine" always means

Nothing real is ever "fine". Remember this

       THE BOY: I'll be back

He walks out. They don't see each other anymore
EXT. I-10 - DAY

The Boy is driving down the highway listening to "Danny Glover" by Young Thug

EXT. MANSION - DAY

The car parks in the driveway. There are three cars already there. When he pulls up, he's playing "Made in America" by JAY Z and Kanye. When it goes off, he continues singing his version while walking up

       THE BOY: Sweet Cream Havarti/ Sweet Mozzarella/ Sweet Cheez-its. They're made in America/ Sweet Bowl of Cheez-its/ Ohhhhh-oohhhhh-

Four dudes are standing waiting at the front door

Something is wrong

The Boy stops singing and stands there in front of the dudes. They look at him
Alone

They all pull out 45s

****

[PLAY SONG "EARTH: THE OLDEST COMPUTER" AT THIS POINT]****

INT. MANSION - DAY

They all walk in

       DUDE 1: Where the packs?

       THE BOY: In that closet

       DUDE 1: Sit over there

[VISUAL]
The Boy sits in the living room. Maybe he could run out the back? Where though?

They're at the top of a mountain. If someone heard a shot in this neighborhood, they'd call the police immediately. Unfortunately, there isn't a police department in the Palisades. He'd be waiting for the Santa Monica department, which would take a minute

The feeling The Boy had now was shockingly similar to the feeling he got at his own parties. People he didn't know or like casually walking through his home and him having to pretend everything is "fine", or that they don't have all the power

Maybe he could text Fam

       DUDE 1 (CONT'D): Give me your phone

The Boy hands him his phone. Fuck

Two dudes stand guard at the front and back exits. One dude packs the bricks from
The closet in a trash bag. Dude 1 (seems to be the leader) is looking through The Boy's phone

It didn't feel like the day The Boy was going to die. Not to say The Boy didn't feel like he was going to die, he was certain he was going to die today. But he didn't feel like today felt like a/the last day/night. Like a Wednesday that keeps feeling like a Friday. But the more he thought about it, if the last day felt like the last day, the world would be a different place. The order we have everyday would vanish if you were guaranteed a warning. People wouldn't live like they do

They wouldn't care what you thought. It'd be anarchy. Or a utopia. Depending on who you ask

Dude 1 puts The Boy's phone in his pocket. The Boy doesn't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. Dude 1 and Dude 2 start talking. It's obvious they're discussing The Boy's fate

If I was the director, the one who made this moment, the one who saw this moment millennia before, the one who coded this world and allowed this to happen, I'd have Thundercat's "We'll Die" playing as The Boy looks around at his once castle

...try to do your best

Oh! It's like Tony Montana. But resigned and, frankly, more realistic, cause it's boring. Everybody dies. Most of them are boring

All the dudes walk out except Dude 2. He stays. Dude 1 still has his phone as he walks out. The Boy realizes this action is bad

       DUDE 2: Toss me your wallet

This is bad. The Boy tosses the wallet. Dude 2 looks through it

       THE BOY: Can I drown?

Dude 2 looks up

       THE BOY (CONT'D): I just want to die how I want

There's a pool out there. You're supposed to get this wave of euphoria when you drown. Supposed to be good

Dude 2 stares

       THE BOY (CONT'D): I could just float there. They'd find me

Dude 2 starts to walks over...

(Does it change anything when you're aware of your last thoughts?)

Dude 2 sits next to him

       DUDE 2: We've been watching you for a while. You're very sloppy

He's a cop. This nigga's a cop

       DUDE 2 (CONT'D): I'm just gonna stay here with you for a minute. My guys are picking up those guys up the street

       THE BOY: Oh

Silence

       THE BOY (CONT'D): I'm going to jail?

       DUDE 2: Yep

The Boy looks to the pool in the backyard and sees his own body floating lifeless

[VISUAL]

Eyes wide, bubbles clinging to his face. Orange, yellow, and brown leaves float above him. His left shoe floating far ahead, probably from struggling at some point. Next to the pool, Naomi and Steve stand over him. Neither is crying or really seem too upset.  They just look on as if the movie they were watching took an abrupt turn and they're mildly interested rather than satisfied
It looks peaceful. Fitting. He'd like to go out like that


...what's that sound?


Tires SCREECH outside. Dude 2 stands up. There's a small crash outside. Yelling

       VOICE: FREEZE!

GUNSHOTS

The Boy and Dude 2 look at each other

Dude 1 kicks open the door. He starts firing. Dude 2 falls. A mist of red puff spurts from his chest. He's screaming

Dude 1 turns to The Boy and sho

INT. MANSION - NIGHT

[VISUAL]

The Boy sits at his piano; playing randomly, trying to make sense of everything/anything. Steve and Swank talk to Emily and MISLA in the kitchen. They're arguing about driving, or cooking with coconut oil instead of olive oil, or something else they themselves will not care about or remember in a month, year, ten years, 100 years, the age of the universe

The house is starting to look pretty bad. The cleaners that used to come stopped receiving their payment and stopped coming. Plastic cups are starting to spread like a blue rash across the living room and coffee tables. Every surface has a sticky spot. You used to be able to slide into the kitchen from the living room with a two second run and quick stop. Now, dried alcohol stops you before you even get to the kitchen door. The Boy really loved sliding into the kitchen when he was a kid. It was the closest you could get to having powers

*******

[PLAY SONG "THE PARTY" AT THIS POINT]*******

[VISUAL]

Minutes go by. People start to crowd around The Boy as he continues on piano. So many people he can't think
Fam daps up a kid as he walks in. They then walk over to a closet where Fam opens up a pantry of weed. It's not nostalgic rap video stocked with weed, but there's a lot of weed in there. Fam tosses an ounce of weed at the kid. The kid and his friend smell it and nod. They look to Fam to share a smile of like "good shit, right?", but Fam isn't there for em. Fam gives em the "where's my money you privileged ass-hole" look. They pull out some hundreds

Misla is sitting knees to chest with a french dude in the center of the pool table. They're eating s'mores

Emily and Steve are jumping over the fire pit like idiots

There are people saying things, giving opinions, feeling interesting. Everyone has a purpose tonight. It's a great time

But then:

...this is a waste

       THE BOY: Get

...of time

       THE BOY (CONT'D): Out. Everyone

No one can hear him. It's a party


       THE BOY (CONT'D): Everyone needs to get out. NOW!

People start to notice. The Boy gets up from the piano and grabs a pool stick. He quickly walks over to the ipod dock playing music and winds up like it's a bat

SMASH
Everyone stares

       FUCKBOY 2: That's my phone, nigga!

The Boy looks up. There's a deep inhale, then he starts smashing everything. Glass sprays everywhere, alcohol splashes, people start running out

       SOME DUDE 2: Worldstar!

The Boy continues hitting things. He's about to come down on somoeone's phone that's lying on the coffee table. He holds the pool cue above his head and lets it down fast

But right before, someone grabs the cell phone, laying their hand on top of it, daring The Boy to hit the hand. The Boy barely stops in time
The hand has a cast on it. The Boy looks up to see a girl (NAOMI) staring at him. She looks mad. The Boy is mad. But not at her. He's trying to look mad at her, but he really looks like "sorry"
Eyes locked
She slowly takes her phone, making complete eye contact the entire time, then walks out. Everyone stares at this strange interaction
As soon as she leaves, The Boy goes back to smashing things

       THE BOY: Get out! Get away!

Some people start running out trying not to get hit. Other people just laugh cause they're high or because they think it's pathetic. They all leave eventually
The Boy stands there for a moment. He turns to the bar next to the pool table. There's half a blunt and a bottle of Sriracha sitting there. The Boy takes the bottle and starts squirting it on the pool table
When he's done, he's written: "ROSCOE'S WETSUIT"

       FAM: Nice

The Boy turns. Fam's just sitting there. No one even noticed him. Fam gives him a SMH. The Boy leaves

INT. THE BOY'S ROOM - LATER NIGHT
The Boy lays in his bed. Blue and black stripes from the shades fold over his face. He can hear raccoons scurrying outside
He sees a spider in the corner of the room. Just sitting in its web
94
The Boy doesn't particularly like or dislike spiders. They're everywhere in the house. It's a big house and it's right next to a reserve. But something about this spider sitting there...it really bothers him. It makes him mad. He can hear the spider. Just sitting there. Getting louder
I'm going to describe it as emotional tinnitus: when everything is silent and quiet, you can see the empty web you're in. It is annoying. Which is the slowest form of torture
...The Boy gets up

CUT TO:INT. CAR - NIGHT
The Boy drives. I'm not sure where he's driving. He's not sure where he's driving
He drives about an hour out into some industrial wasteland-looking nook of Los Angeles
He parks his car

[VISUAL]
Then, barefoot, he sits on the roof of his car and watches the cars pass. Bright lights grow to an explosion then fade out as they pass. He goes into his pocket and holds the "hackz" flash drive that we saw on his desk at the beginning
Someone spray painted "ROSCOE'S WETSUIT" on the side of the bridge. The Boy is not surprised. It's not making more sense, but it's becoming more dependable, which is always nice
The Boy realizes he hasn't eaten all day. Maybe that's what's wrong

CUT TO:
EXT. FATBURGER - NIGHT
The Boy orders a burger in the drive thru
A skinny Latino kid with a Bluetooth hands him the bag. The Boy pulls over to the side and opens the bag. He looks at the burger for a moment
The Boy throws the burger out

CUT TO:
INT. MANSION - NIGHT
The Boy walks through the house; locking all the doors and turning off all the lights. It's always a weird feeling to walk around the house at night because most of the walls are glass, so people can see right inside, especially when it's dark. It's pretty hard to even get to the house, it's the highest home on the hill and there's a long winding road before . But at the same time, if someone got up there, it'd be easy to figure out how to get in
All the lights are off now
The Boy walks over to The Buddha in the middle of the foyer. He sits on the floor next to him with his knees to his chest. Looking out the front door into half the darkness and half his reflection. He used to be terrified of this Buddha. When he was little, he'd run behind the statue like it would jump on him as soon as he past. But He slowly became something like a best friend. Something like that

INT. THE BOY'S ROOM - NIGHT
The Boy pours Pelligrino into a wine glass. Then he continues to twist his metal weed grinder in his hand. He takes the top off the grinder and pours the white powder inside the glass. He drinks it, then sits on the foot of the bed and takes off his white T-shirt
Pulling the covers over his body, he looks at the spider in the corner...only it was gone. Where'd it go? Why would it leave? What about its parents? Won't they be sad? What a bout hi s frien ds?

INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

[VISUAL]

The Boy wakes up. He's in a gown. His eyes feel heavy. The TV is on in his room. "Golden Girls" to be specific. One of the ladies just said something funny cause there's a lot of laughter

Sitcom laughs always freaked him out. Because most of those people are dead. Those are ghost laughs. Laughs that are supposed to be gone forever linger on earth after every mid 90s joke about teenage sex or someone saying "don't go there". Looking for their mouths, never finding them because they're gone. The laughs don't feel good because they're dead laughs. Those laughs aren't what they stood for anymore. They've been reappropriated. Now they're just sounds monkey descendants make when amused to cue other monkey descendants when to make the sounds at home

...my eyes feel heavy

A nurse comes in

       WHITE GUY NURSE: Hello Mr.

[EDIT]. How are you feeling?
       THE BOY: Like I'm about to get talked to by someone about- (gestures) All this

Nurse gives a "yep" look
       WHITE GUY NURSE: You're friends brought you in-
       THE BOY: They're not my friends
       WHITE GUY NURSE: I don't think they'd like you saying that
       THE BOY: Doesn't matter. It's the truth. But also, they know. We're not friends. There's a mutual benefit to our relationship, but I can't trust them for shit
       WHITE GUY NURSE: Then why save you?
       THE BOY: Cause their lives are far easier with me around. It's survival
       WHITE GUY NURSE: I think you should talk to someone
       THE BOY: We're talking
       WHITE GUY NURSE: A professional
       THE BOY: Why? You don't care. You're not gonna make sure I do. (then) Our lives aren't precious, man

Silence. The Nurse begins to clean up

       WHITE GUY NURSE: You done?
       THE BOY: I was trying to be
       WHITE GUY NURSE: No you weren't. Cause, guess what? It's not hard to do

Nurse leaves

INT. WAITING ROOM - LATER THAT DAY
The Boy walks out of the double doors. Steve, Swank, and Fam are sitting there. They look up wearily

       THE BOY: I don't wanna talk. Let's just go be awkward and quiet together at Chipotle. Alright?

They all just stare. Swank gets up slowly and walks over
       SWANK: Man...we didn't know if we should wait or tell you later, man

The Boy makes a 

["WHAT?" EMOJI] face

       SWANK (CONT'D): Man...your pops died, man. Got the call

Silence

       THE BOY: Okay

[PLAY SONG "ZEALOTS OF STOCKHOLM" AT THIS POINT]*******

INT. JET PLANE - EVENING
The Boy lays his head against the plane window, the oil from his hair leaving grease smudges all over the window
His father died in Stockholm. A family member was needed. Didn't realize that they were each other's only family til this very moment. When you lose that, you basically lose most of your memories, at least the accuracy of your own memories
He wanted to be cremated
The Boy didn't really know anyone in Stockholm, but he also didn't want to be in his hotel room with his father for a day. Even if he was just ashes. So he decided to search through his followers for someone from Sweden

Some girl named "Hello_Pity_" Dm'd him back and they were supposed to meet up after all the whatever he had to do. Her profile bio said she was half french. She looked pretty in her avi: an inverted Hello Kitty. But that really doesn't mean anything at all, especially since her instagram was blocked, which is something he's learned not to trust at all
So he looked through her tweets, figured out a night she went to a club, used one of his dummy profiles and pretended that they'd met at the club that night. She had trouble remembering because, according to her feed, she was "fuckin turnt, 

[CRAZY TONGUE OUT EMOJI] lol". She added this made up dude as a friend on Facebook. Now The Boy could see her pictures
The rest of her pictures confirmed she was indeed pretty
This girl loves Justin Bieber though. New Justin Bieber. The "fuck you" Bieber. She loves Justin Bieber in the way you love that girl on Maury who's like "my favorite flavor popsicle is DICK!", which is close to sincere love, but nowhere near it at the same time

INT. STRANGE OFFICE - NIGHT
The Boy is sitting at a desk, across from a solemn man. An urn sits on the left side of the desk
The man slides it over to The Boy
       SOLEMN MAN: I'm sorry for your loss

Silence. Don't you have to ask someone before you cremate their father? I don't know how these things work

       SOLEMN MAN (CONT'D): These were found with him

He gives The Boy a large brown paper bag

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
The Boy vapes on the foot of his bed. He's DMing back and forth with "Hello_Pity_" whose real name is Alyssa

       thegoldmolar: where u at

       thegoldmolar: yeah

He puts his phone down

EXT. STOCKHOLM STREETS - NIGHT
There's a buzz going on. Very pretty people walk hand in hand on the street. There are people saying things, giving opinions, feeling interesting. Everyone has a purpose tonight. It's a great time
A couple walk by:

       SUPER HANDSOME GUY: Swedish blah blah blah roscoe's wetsuit hahahaha!
       SUPER PRETTY GIRL: blah blah, swedish blah blah roscoe's wetsuit!

The Boy walks up to a pink, glowing, but very discreet sign that says "box". There's a big bald guy standing outside with no hat. There's steam coming off his head
A girl is standing outside smoking, at least trying to. She can't seem to get the cigarette lit. It's Alyssa

       THE BOY: Hey
       ALYSSA: Ah! It's you

She gives him a kiss on both cheeks

       ALYSSA (CONT'D): Fancy meeting you like this, huh?
       THE BOY: I don't know what you mean

She puts out her cigarette. After two big puffs

       ALYSSA: Let's go
       THE BOY: Didn't you want me to meet your boyfriend?
       ALYSSA: Who? That guy?

She points to a corner of the building, a few steps from the front. A guy with long blonde hair (her boyfriend?)is making out with a girl in the cold

       THE BOY: What am I getting into?
       ALYSSA: Nothing. You're getting into nothing

CUT TO:
EXT. STOCKHOLM STREETS - CONTINUOUS
The Boy and Alyssa walk slowly through the streets. It's very cold, so they're the only ones doing that

       ALYSSA: What made you DM me?
       THE BOY: I don't know anyone here
       ALYSSA: Then why are you here?
       THE BOY: My dad died. I have to pick him up
       ALYSSA: R O U G H. How?
       THE BOY: Doesn't matter at this point
       ALYSSA: I know right? It's always "how'd he die?" Like if you know all the ways, you'll avoid it. Silly

She shivers

       ALYSSA (CONT'D): I don't believe in small talk. What's the longest relationship you've been in?
       THE BOY: Five years
       ALYSSA: Wow. What happened?
       THE BOY: I'm still in it
       ALYSSA: Oh?
       THE BOY: She does private web shows. We're not together. But it's a relationship, for sure
       ALYSSA: I don't get it
       THE BOY: I used to watch her online a while back. Then she quit and started doing private shows. Then it just started turning into talking. Mostly
       ALYSSA: Wooooaah
       THE BOY: Wha?
       ALYSSA: You're paying her to be your girlfriend or friend or whatever
       THE BOY: Yes. But most people are paying for friends one way or another
       ALYSSA: No
       THE BOY: Your boyfriend is making out with another girl right now. You don't really have room to judge
       ALYSSA: I trust that I can never trust him. We're clear on that
       THE BOY: Then why have him at all?
       ALYSSA: Because he's honest. And I like that. He doesn't lie to either of us. That's special to me

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

[VISUAL]
The two are sitting on the bed staring at the urn on the table

       ALYSSA: So that's your dad
       THE BOY: That's my dad. That's what's left of him
       ALYSSA: You guys close?
       THE BOY: No
       ALYSSA: You wanna talk about it
       THE BOY: No

Silence

       THE BOY (CONT'D): I'm going to make a drink
       ALYSSA: Alright

The Boy gets up and goes into the living room. While he's in there, Alyssa gets up, takes the urn, and walks out of the room. The Boy hears the door slam

       THE BOY: Alyssa?

CUT TO:

*******

[PLAY SONG "URN" AT THIS POINT]*******

EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT
The Boy runs out of the front doors. His breath, clouding in the night. He looks both ways and catches Alyssa turning a corner. He runs to the corner and meets her on the other side

       THE BOY: What's going on
       ALYSSA: Let's get rid of it. It's just bad for you
       THE BOY: You have a TON of nerve judging me and my father's relationship, so much so, you just walk out with his ashes? I feel like what you're doing is against the law, but much like the fact he was cremated before I arrived, I don't know if it's illegal. I'm still pissed though
       ALYSSA: We're gonna do this together

The Boy is pissed. He's trying not to blow up

       ALYSSA (CONT'D): I had a sister. I did this when she died
       THE BOY: Yes. That gives you the right

Alyssa digs in her pocket and pulls out her phone. She turns it on and the background is Alyssa and a girl that looks exactly like her. The Boy takes the phone

       THE BOY (CONT'D): Twins
       ALYSSA: Yes
       THE BOY: I know we agreed that it's dumb to ask since we're all headed that way anyway, but-
       ALYSSA: Brain cancer. It was bad

Silence

       ALYSSA (CONT'D): So crazy

She LOLs. They're still walking this entire time. They stop at the water. They stand there making small clouds for a moment

       ALYSSA (CONT'D): You want to say something?

The Boy shrugs

       ALYSSA (CONT'D): Alright-
       THE BOY: Wait

The urn almost tips over the edge. She waits for him. He walks over and takes the urn and just holds it for a moment. Then he kinda hugs it. Laying his head on it, but turning his head so she can't see what he says:

       THE BOY (CONT'D, whisper): I'm sorry we're alone

[VISUAL]

He pours out the ashes. He's gone

       ALYSSA: How do you feel? Better?
       THE BOY: I feel...the same
       VOICE: HEY!

Alyssa and The Boy turn around. It's Alyssa's boyfriend

       BOYFRIEND: What the fuck, bro?
       ALYSSA: Oh, so you now you give a fuck

She pushes him back as he takes swipes at The Boy. The Boy is mildly annoyed. They're all yelling at each other

       BOYFRIEND/THE BOY/ALYSSA: You're dead ass-hole!/ Relax, nothing happened/ Would you stop!

The boyfriend breaks free from her

       BOYFRIEND: Do you know who the fuck I am?

       ALYSSA: Please don't. Please don't do this
       THE BOY: Nah, man. I don't know who you are
       BOYFRIEND (CONT'D, scream): WHAT DOES THE FOX SAY! (silence) I. Wrote. That. That's my shit. I'm the nigga dressed like a fox. That's all me
       THE BOY: What?

The boyfriend starts making the noises a fox makes in the song

       BOYFRIEND: That!
       ALYSSA (resigned, to The Boy): Like the song and video
       THE BOY: I've never heard of it
       ALYSSA AND BOYFIREND: What/wha?
       ALYSSA: I thought you "were the internet"?
       THE BOY: That's a tagline. No one is the actual internet. I just must've missed it when it was popular
       BOYFRIEND: Uh, by "when it was popular" do you mean, uhhh, RIGHT THE FUCK NOW?!
       THE BOY: Relax
       BOYFRIEND: Two hundred and twenty million views on Youtube. Two hundred and twenty million. That's most of the earth
       THE BOY: Not true
       BOYFRIEND: An African village wrote to me-
       THE BOY: The whole village did?
       BOYFRIEND: -and told me that my song taught them about foxes. They don't have foxes there. I introduced the idea of a fox to an entire continent...(then) And you wanna fuck my girl?

Silence

       THE BOY: I do not wanna fuck your girl. I don't want to be here. I am going home now

The Boy walks away. Alyssa and her boyfriend start a boring argument in the cold as he disappears

CUT TO:
INT. LA VEGAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Fam, another girl, and The Boy sit in a booth at the restaurant. Fam and the girl are talking. The Boy is silent. Don't know if he's just bored or jet lagged from Sweden. Either way he's bumming everyone out

       ANOTHER GIRL: My friend should be here soon

The Boy doesn't say anything. Fam and the girl look on
A girl walks up to the table. The Boy looks up. It's the girl from the party

       NAOMI: Hi

The Boy doesn't say anything

       ANOTHER GIRL: This is Naomi. (then) Hello?
       FAM: He's dumb. You should just sit and ignore him

She sits down

       NAOMI: You're the guy that almost hit my arm
       THE BOY: Yes
       NAOMI: You guys order?
       THE BOY: No. I hate vegan. I think she's making us eat here
       NAOMI: I'm the vegan. I asked to eat here

Silence

       THE BOY: I hate vegan
       NAOMI (saying it dumb): Duhh, "I hate vegan"

In his head, he was lol-ing. In real life, he just kinda looked down

       NAOMI (CONT'D): What's the deal. Why you always act like your parents died

The Boy smirks

       THE BOY: They did

Awkward. Silence

       ANOTHER GIRL: I'm so sorry

Fam and The Boy stare at each other for a moment. Then laugh. Another Girl and Naomi do not

       FAM (to The Boy): Your parents are dead, man
       THE BOY: My parents are dead yo

They slowly stop laughing. Naomi thinks The Boy is weird. But she doesn't run

INT. MANSION - NIGHT
Fam and Another Girl are sitting on the swings smoking and talking about something they will never remember and don't really care about
Naomi and The Boy sit in the living room

       NAOMI: What did he do?
       THE BOY: I don't know
       NAOMI: How'd he afford all this?
       THE BOY: I don't know
       NAOMI: Then how can you afford all this? He leave you a lot?
       THE BOY: Creditors were after him. I don't know if he had anything left. I'm not concerned. (serious) I'm gonna sell drugs

Naomi LMAOs

       NAOMI: Whaaaaaat
       THE BOY: Fam can hook me up. I've been watching him for a minute. He runs out of here already
       NAOMI: I don't think you need me to tell you you're an awful dealer
       THE BOY: How would you even know?
       NAOMI: You make everything feel awkward. You can't connect with anyone. How is anyone supposed to feel like they can trust you?
       THE BOY: Yeah, that's what drug dealers are known for. Their comfort
       NAOMI: They are, dumb-ass. You gotta know how people work. You're only good with people online

He slowly turns to her. "how does she know that?"

       NAOMI (CONT'D): I looked you up
       THE BOY: After the party or just now
       NAOMI: Just now. I'm a writer too
       THE BOY: Oh really
       NAOMI: Yup. And I know I'm good cause people keep stealing my shit

She hits the vape

       NAOMI (CONT'D): I tweeted this. (holds up her phone) Is that not my poem verbatim? I posted them together. This nigga just rapped this like it was his
       THE BOY (looking at her phone): Your first mistake is being a poet past the year 1974, by the way
       NAOMI: That's how good my shit is. I'm bringing the whole form back
       THE BOY: You're cocky when you're high
       NAOMI: No. I'm talkative when I'm high. I'm cocky all the time, but I'm silent for most of it...like you

He looks up. She lifts an eyebrow. He doesn't smile. She goes cross-eyed. No response. She stops, then sighs

       NAOMI (CONT'D): You ever think we're in hell? This is all hell. Living on earth and being the only ones aware that it's all ending slowly

Silence

       THE BOY: No
       NAOMI: I read something that said more than likely we all just do this all again. It's all a cycle
       THE BOY: I like that theory
       NAOMI: Yeah. (then) See? You're not such a lonely boy

She LOLs and mushes his face with her hand. The Boy smh, but smilesRAP GENIUS NOTE: This is the end of Part 4, continue on at Part 5

[Intro]
W-W-W- Well Done
Let’s try some different shit

[Verse 1]
Ahhh
I’m so flashy, you so ratchet
Twelve jewels fashion with a pedal to Matchin'
New Maybach, that’s a hit nigga
Could’ve been the 3rd member, the clipse nigga
Listen niggas, I go grizzly that’s Memphis nigga
Ross rap that 24, ain’t gotta convince niggas
Early pimpin, throw like Blake Griffin
Lips zip it
Niggas gossip like it’s tradition
These bitches can’t drive my car
The melt engine, hell’s risen
Ride Diablo to a baptism, he Christian
Fear nothing but God, kill all except women and children
I don’t testify not in my interest
Persistence, diligence, the skill I bring can feed the hunger mission
Got the whole world, fill em on my brand but they won’t mention it
You afraid of my accomplishments
You a bitch, straight up got a taser for my bitch with a laser
And she just wishin' for a genie in the bottle
This is not a novel, we no feel for sorrow and it shine tomorrow
Super dollars like a super lotto, shootin' at yo collar
Now you sippin' soup to swallow
Go throwin' in the towel
Our time is now but we devour everything we offer
Then pop it up but drink and blow a sake
Mr. kick shit Myiagi
Wax on, wax off
Ferrari, she gon' lick the lolly
I am not the baby boy terazi, slick lody
Laughin at yo clown pose, you bust into you
I got arsenal, time to give to be impossible
Options to embarrass you, I just choose what God would do
Can’t waste my time on you
Fuckers can’t rhyme no more
Bout crime no more
Made so much money at home, didn’t even tour
My fans waitin', savin' up for greatness, I appreciate it
Let’s get back to basics

[Intro: Esty]
Tell me when to stop…
Tell me when to stop…

[Bridge: Esty]
In the haze we lose
Can’t just have it all
In the haze we fall
Coulda had it all
In the haze we lose
Can’t just have it all
In the haze we lose
We coulda had it all

[Verse 1: Esty]
Be honest, I know you now
You look to see
Stop and wait
And really it don’t matter
I know you do (I know you do)
You don’t understand, there’s a time and place
I’m gon let you know, now listen
I don’t you to, you don’t want to say it
Tell me what it is you feel
Don’t be shy
(Don’t be shy)

[Hook: Esty]
Testin' you like you testin' me
Testin' you while you testin' me
Testin' you like you testin' me
Testin' you like you testin' me
And I know

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Uh, watching the stars
On a yellow brick road like the Wizard of Oz
Ain’t no workin titles for this little thing of ours
I tell you the game like I'm Ahmad rashad
I put roses on my neck, rose petal and stars
I kiss you down low but I let you decide
I get behind you like you’re making dirty wind
Get you a glass of muscato, that’s yo favorite wine
And I… know
Can’t hold yo prop cuz it’s yours
Like Versace models you be giftin leather
You my bread and butter, let’s toast
And I… hope
Like Shepard's Fairey we can fly canaries
Obey my presence, you are a blessing
I am a reverend so start confessing

[Bridge:Esty]
In the haze we lose
Can’t just have it all
In the haze we fall
Coulda had it all
In the haze we lose
Can’t just have it all
In the haze we lose
We coulda had it all

[Hook: Esty]
Testin' you like you testin' me
Testin' you while you testin' me
Testin' you like you testin' me
Testin' you like you testin' me
And I know

Thugger Thugger
Thugger
Stoner Life, YSL
(808 Mafia)

[Chorus]
Okay, cool, okay, bool, I love her
I'ma save her, yes, like Danny Glover
I'ma call my papi for her, fuck the mother
I pass them a molly, now they kiss each-other (Hot)
Every time I fuck I gotta hit me least like two bitches
Boy, that dope been whipped, you need like new wrists
Foreign car outside, that bitch got two digits
Money stand like eight feet just like two midgets

[Verse 1]
Who the fuck told you that Young Thugger Thugger don't fuck up the beat?
I got six cars, and I also got rentals, and all of 'em tinted
No, I'm not Nipsey, not from L.A., but I got keys to the city
I fuck it, I suck it, I beat it down, then she beat me to the ceiling
Stoner my lifestyle
I'm livin' too wild
I came to make you proud
That money keep her around
In love with her head, I can't turn it down
Can't wait for my time to come back around
She see that you don't got Lil Haiti's style
Plus I just seen Snoop on Girls Gone Wild
I just bought a Bentley and a bitch came with it
Young rich nigga hittin' million dollar licks
Balling in New York like a motherfucking Knick
You better have them racks, you ever want to hear me spit
And everywhere I go I gotta pass like the staff
I'm goin' off top like a motherfuckin' lay up
357, six shots like Al
I left ten bands in a motherfuckin' cab

[Chorus]
Okay, cool, okay, bool, I love her
I'ma save her, yes, like Danny Glover
I'ma call my papi for her, fuck the mother
I pass them a molly, now they kiss each-other (Hot)
Every time I fuck I gotta hit me least like two bitches
Boy, that dope been whipped, you need like new wrists
Foreign car outside, that bitch got two digits
Money stand like eight feet just like two midgets

[Verse 2]
I knew I was gonna run my money up and everybody didn't
All these niggas pussy niggas, tellin' on they partner
Hope the pussy nigga get a bigger sentence
Pussy nigga play, I'm coming back with the K
And I'ma shoot that motherfucker 'til he livid
Bitches wanna see a nigga thumb through it fast
I'ma name myself Young Thug Attendant
Hundred bands at a time I fronted you bags, but you
I don't like using profanity, but the Young Thugger will cut you
All of my cups are muddy I fuck my bitches' buddies
I just want nut like Buddy, all of my bitches buddies
Panamera with the tinted roof
All the niggas dogs goin', "Roof"
Top notch shawty, nigga ring came with karats
Young nigga rich, jewelry colder than the attic
If she ain't a virgin, then that bitch is only average
I can't even hear ya, baby, get rid of the static
I can't learn a bitch, but I learned mathematics
I just ball her down whenever she call my pattern

[Chorus]
Okay, cool, okay, bool, I love her
I'ma save her, yes, like Danny Glover
I'ma call my papi for her, fuck the mother
I pass them a molly, now they kiss each-other (Hot)
Every time I fuck I gotta hit me least like two bitches
Boy, that dope been whipped, you need like new wrists
Foreign car outside, that bitch got two digits
Money stand like eight feet just like two midgets

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Now here you go again, you say you want your freedom
Well, who am I to keep you down?
It's only right that you should play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
And what you lost

[Chorus]
Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say, women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know
You'll know

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Now here I go again, I see the crystal visions
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams
And have you any dreams you'd like to sell?
Dreams of loneliness

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering what you had
And what you lost
And what you had
Oh, what you lost

[Chorus]
Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know

[Chorus]
Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say, women, they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know

[Outro]
You'll know
You will know
Oh, you'll know
Hey Moneyman the crowd is outside. The past, the future and the now is outside. The teachers and cooks and the drop-outs too. Word on the street is they looking for you…

Hey Moneyman they saying whats the score? And how much blood have you spilled on the butcher shop floor? Those numbers keep running but what they running into? The crowd is outside and they asking of you…

Hey Moneyman Moneyman the mayors' on the phone. He says he wants to know if all those people went home. Those momma's and poppa's and students and cooks. Those teachers and preachers, one second I'll look…

Hey Moneyman Moneyman the tents are still up, the songs are still singing and the coffee's in cups. The nights due to fall and the sun's going down but its still a whole mess of good folks hanging round...

They eyes are wide and their voices are loud. Its white and black and colorless proud. The signs are big and the smiles are bright. By heaven I reckon its gone be one hell of a night!

Hey Moneyman poor Moneyman you should slip out the back. Cuz the forces of greed are under attack. No bombs or bullets or rocks or guns. Just hashtag's and voices at the tops of their lungs!

And Moneyman Moneyman I won't need a ride. But if you need me…

You can find me outside!

It’s the moment that I know we’ve both been waiting for
Now we can pretend we’re together again
In the dark letting this slow chill take control
And we ain’t supposed to be doin this
We know the consequence
But we’re past the limit and there ain’t no turnin’ back now
You already got my body gripped
Yeah boy you know I like that shit
So we’re past the limit
And there ain’t no turnin’ back now

[Hook: Kelly Rowland]

You don’t know if your addicted till you relapse

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
From detox of lovin’ each other
If just for an hour or two or three
Till six in the morning
Do you have a good excuse
To be on the down low with me
In the tele suite
We know that we ain’t supposed to be doin this
We know the consequence
But we’re past the limit
And there ain’t no turnin back now

So we’re past the limit
And there ain’t no turnin back now

[Hook: R. Kelly]

And there ain’t nothing that can shut you up now
Especially when I’m doing circles
For now I’m teasing you, but in a minute I’m pleasing you

[Hook]

And when I look at the way your booty poke outta that dress
Naw, naw, girl don't try to hide it

Girl, this chemistry we share so insane
Girl, you know what's happening, me and you just laughing
Plus my phone done died so put your number on this napkin

[Chorus]
Shawty we been sipping on bub
And I done had enough, let's get up out this club
'Cause I'm tryna get you alone, alone, alone
You alone, alone, alone
Shawty we been flirting all night
And once we outside, can I offer you a ride?
'Cause I'm tryna get you alone, alone, alone
You alone, alone, alone

[Verse 2]
Beautiful, gorgeous
I ain't tryna buy your time, I can't afford it
What I'm tryna do is paint a pretty portrait
Me and you, a chariot ride with horses
I done came a long way from white tees and Forces
And as a man I understand we can't force it
But if I walk you outside where the Porche is
I'm tryna take you back home to my fortress
Woman, take my hand, tell me what's your name
Girl, this chemistry we share is off the chain
Tell me what you think, you and I been laughing
Baby girl, I'm asking for a night of passion

[Chorus]
Shawty we been sipping on bub
And I done had enough, let's get up out this club
'Cause I'm tryna get you alone, alone, alone
You alone, alone, alone
Shawty we been flirting all night
And once we outside, can I offer you a ride?
'Cause I'm tryna get you alone, alone, alone
You alone, alone, alone
All that I'm thinking

[Bridge]
All I'm thinking, how can we get alone alone alone?
Just you and me baby, alone alone alone, just you and I
And once I get you, I'ma kiss you, I'ma touch you
'Cause you're soft as tissue, when you leave me I'ma miss you
Gotta get you alone alone alone alone

[Chorus]
Shawty we been sipping on bub
And I done had enough, let's get up out this club
'Cause I'm tryna get you alone, alone, alone
You alone, alone, alone
Shawty we been flirting all night
And once we outside, can I offer you a ride?
'Cause I'm tryna get you alone, alone, alone
You alone, alone, alone

[Outro]
I hope you're cool with that
Just you and I, girl

[Intro]
Passion, pain, pleasure
Hurts when I laugh sometimes
Feels good when I cry
Tell me when you're looking at me
Can you see the pain in my eyes?

[Verse]
As the stars shine deep in the night sky
As the sun sits way above the clouds
As the world spins, time and time again
Look at myself, wondering where I've been
City to city and girl with you one night's all I got to give
You don't know me no matter how I might appear
Will I ever know, why do I feel so alone?
Since a child I was told, all that glitters ain't gold
Got lost in the moment, tryna find what I wanted
So I'm drowning in regret and I'll never forget
Everything that I had before the good turned bad

[Intro]
I'd do anything, just to hear your voice

[Verse 1]
It’s been too long, since I've seen your face
Since I smelled the fragrance of your perfume and I can’t get a hold of myself no more
I tried to play it cool, but I’m simply breaking, breaking down girl
And I need you to build me up again girl, build me up again

[Pre-Chorus]
I neglected you, expected you to stay forever, yes I did
Now you’re gone and I’m supposed to find another, no no

[Chorus]
Girl, I need you to please return my call 'cause I’m sorry
And I need to hear from you, I was wrong, that’s why I
Girl, I need you to please return my call, promise I regret it all, only we know what I’ve lost
I just wanna talk, so wherever you are, please return my call

[Verse 2]
Now I’ll give up anything, for the joy only your smile can bring
Just to see your face come through that door but until then, I’m gon' pray some more, yeah, I’m gon' pray some more
Pleads by the bedside 'cause you’re the best thing that happened in my life
And I gotta get you back and I’m dealing with the fact that I know

[Pre-Chorus]
I neglected you, expected you to stay forever, yes I did
Now you’re gone and I’m supposed to find another, no no

[Chorus]
Girl, I need you to please return my call 'cause I’m sorry
And I need to hear from you, I was wrong, that’s why I
Girl, I need you to please return my call, promise I regret it all, only we know what I’ve lost
I just wanna talk, so wherever you are, please return my call

[Bridge]
You know, baby I just need you to understand that my life is not worth living without you
And I know you’re mad, I know you’re mad
Better yet, I know you’re disappointed
And I promise I’ll do better, just pick up the phone

[Chorus]
Girl, I need you to please return my call 'cause I’m sorry
And I need to hear from you, I was wrong, that’s why I
Girl, I need you to please return my call, promise I regret it all, only we know what I’ve lost
I just wanna talk, so wherever you are, please return my call

[Outro]
Girl I need you to, please

[Verse 1]
He left his heart at the counter, met a stranger in a foreign town
They say the city was pretty, they say what goes around comes back around
And then there's a sound, what's that sound? That, that's panic
A schizophrenic, psychopathic lover

[Chorus]
But through his eyes, she looks so beautiful
But through his eyes, she looks so harmless
And out of the sky, pain starts falling down
And out of the sky, his eyes go blind, blind
His eyes go blind, blind, blind
His eyes go blind, blind, blind

[Verse 2]
He left his face on the table, put his nose smack dead on the line
And you can check at the bar, he's the talk of the town, now, now, now, now
His new love can no longer be found, hey what's that sound?
Listen out for the sound of paramedics, just forget it, he should have seen it

[Chorus]
But through his eyes, she looks so beautiful
But through his eyes, she looks so harmless
And out of the sky, pain starts falling down
And out of the sky, his eyes go blind, blind
But through his eyes, she looks so beautiful
But through his eyes, she looks so harmless

[And out of the sky, pain starts falling down
And there ain't no way to run, ain't no way to hide](6886226

[But through his eyes, she looks so beautiful
But through his eyes, she looks so harmless](6886217)
And out of the sky, pain starts falling down
And out of the sky, his eyes go blind, blind

[Outro]
His eyes go blind, blind, blind, blind
His eyes go blind, blind, blind
His eyes go blind, blind, blind, blind
His eyes go blind, blind, blind, through his eyes
And out of the sky, pain starts falling down, pain, pain, pain
And out of the sky, his eyes go blind,blind, blind

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
The way you do that dance in the club, yeah I like that
You belong on stage where the lights at
You belong on the runway, dressed like a model
I ain't talkin' where the planes take flight at
Girl, you make me wanna sing or somethin'

Your sex make your ass wanna fein for somethin'
Go straight, and you ain't never gon' need for nothin'
Do your freaky dance, girl we all up in the club

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Ay what it is girl, we just howin' out

I don't even really care if you're a whore or not
Hey, hol' up shawty, don't be mad, I'm just jokin' now

But just be cool, you know everybody watchin' now
You got a man, he a fool if he's not around

High yellow, light brown, pretty long hair
Just how I like, they see me starin', shawty I don't care
5 feet tall, maybe 4'10
Ay, how you stay so thick when you so thin?
Tight jean got that cameo cole showin'
G string make a nigga wanna go in
Came all by yourself, brought no friend
Well, what you hesitatin' for? Let's go

[Hook: Swizz Beatz & Trey Songz]

Hey, ho, I like that

[Verse 1]
Told you from the get go, I would never let go
You remain a turn on, hope you know like I know
I'ma always love you, when nobody else do
I'm be the shelter, you can always run to
You're the one I run to, when I need a shoulder
I'm the one you run to, when you need a soldier
Say that I'm the realest one you ever met
But girl, this is the realest thing I ever said

[Pre-Chorus]
If you give me the world, then it won't mean nothing
'Cause if you leave my world, then I won't have nothing

[Chorus]
And this is from my heart, ay ay, this is from my soul, ay ay
Lovers may come, ay ay and lovers may go, ay ay
But I don't worry about a thing 'cause as long as we're together
Babe I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know that
No one's gonna love me better
No one's gonna love me better
No one's gonna love me

[Verse 2]
You the one I'm cool with, you know what to do with
Everything I'm giving baby, you know who the truth is
You know where the safe at, you know who my boo is
Never had a fake bag, always on that new shit
You the only beat that could play in my heart
Imagine just to think of us apart
Say that I'm the realest one you ever met
But girl, this is the realest thing I ever said

[Pre-Chorus]
If you give me the world, then it won't mean nothing
'Cause if you leave my world, then I won't have nothing

[Chorus]
And this is from my heart, ay ay, this is from my soul, ay ay
Lovers may come, ay ay and lovers may go, ay ay
But I don't worry about a thing 'cause as long as we're together
Babe I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know that
No one's gonna love me better
No one's gonna love me better
No one's gonna love me

[Bridge]
All I need, you are all I see
Gonna stay together, no matter the weather, sing it now
All I need, you are all I see
Baby I know, I know, I know
No one's gonna love me better
No one's gonna love me better
No one's gonna love me better
No one's gonna love me better
No one's gonna love me

[Verse 1]
You don't know who you're fucking with
Ain't no Democrat, and by far I'm no Republican
This is the type of talk that'll probably piss off my publicist
And I ain't even started, the water ain't even bubbling
The type of talk that'll probably get me in trouble with the law
Or make the government come after me in public
Won't hear this on the radio, this here is not for publishing
This ain’t that bubble gum shit, no, this ain’t that Double Mint
Consider this a risk, I swear I see them building pyramids brick by brick
They'll aim at anyone bold enough to go against the shit
You don't believe me? Look what happened to the Dixie Chicks
It's like nobody else complains
Until you try to be more than a nigga with a chain
Cube already told you: "they corrupted everything"
And we're just out here trying to function, trying to maintain

[Hook]
A hundred miles an hour, running when I hit the ground
Thoughts moving through my head at the speed of sound
I pray my prayers make it through the clouds
I pray in heaven that them fuck niggas ain’t allowed
A hundred miles an hour, running when I hit the ground
Thoughts moving through my head at the speed of sound
I pray, I pray my prayers make it through the cloud
Until then it's back to the paper route, the paper route

[Verse 2]
And of course, it's unfortunate that niggas out here robbing for Jordans
Can we not afford them, but got enough to get a Glock 40
Is our views on reality kinda distorted
But still, even though I understand the story
I still fall weak for a booty that's proportionate
On the sexy short bitch, so what's the score?
Chilling with some Red dogs, drinking White man's poison
Now that's a forfeit
Selling what's for free, that's extortion
But still I'm wondering what families were present when history was recorded

[Hook]
A hundred miles an hour, running when I hit the ground
Thoughts moving through my head at the speed of sound
I pray my prayers make it through the clouds
I pray in heaven that them fuck niggas ain’t allowed
A hundred miles an hour, running when I hit the ground
Thoughts moving through my head at the speed of sound
I pray, I pray my prayers make it through the cloud
Until then it's back to the paper route, the paper route

[Verse 3]
You think you really know what's going on?
They're passing laws where they can run up in your own home
Cameras on your laptop, TV and your iPhone
The battery don't come out, that means it's always on
Smile and say cheese, yeah niggas, gotcha!
I told you fuckers three years ago about The Watchers
If you don't take the microchip, then you can't make no dollars
This ain't no lovely day for a neighbour, this ain't no Mr Rodgers
Don't let them fuckers rob us for our freedom and our rights
And you be like: "it's on the news so it must be right"
Who's pulling the strings? Who's rolling the dice?
Who's calling the shots and who's starting the fight?
Think twice...

[Hook]
A hundred miles an hour, running when I hit the ground
Thoughts moving through my head at the speed of sound
I pray my prayers make it through the clouds
I pray in heaven that them fuck niggas ain’t allowed
A hundred miles an hour, running when I hit the ground
Thoughts moving through my head at the speed of sound
I pray, I pray my prayers make it through the cloud
Until then it's back to the paper route, the paper route

[Verse 1]
Why do we all
Want all the things that we can't have at all?
Eyes to the sky
But where do you look when the sky starts to fall?
I look at my life
Wondering "how did I travel this far?"
Stuck in the sand
Lost in the desert, I'm trapped in the storm

[Bridge 1]
In search of a shore
Lost in the desert, I'm searching for more
In search of a shore
Trapped in the desert, still searching for more
In search of a shore
Lost in the desert, I'm trapped in the storm
I look at my life
Wondering "how did I travel this far?"

[Chorus]
Maybe I'm blind
By human desire, human design
Just a little bit further 'til I arrive
Or is it just a mirage fooling my mind?
How foolish am I?
How foolish am I?
How foolish am I?

[Verse 2]
Why am I here
In the same club with my back to the wall?
Speeding through life
Just to end up running back to the start
Backward and forward
In every direction, disaster's in store
Like I'm stranded at sea
It feels like the end but I know that there's more

[Bridge 2]
Still I'm searching for shore
Stuck out at sea and I'm searching for more
In search of a shore
Stranded at sea but I'm searching for more
In search of a shore
Stuck out at sea and I'm trapped in a storm
I look at my life
Wondering "how did I travel this far?"

[Chorus]
Maybe I'm blind
By human desire, human design
Just a little bit further 'til I arrive
Or is it just a mirage fooling my mind?
How foolish am I?

[Verse 3]
Born under the view of the eye
The world can be ruthless, foolish and blind
Abracadabra, illusion and lies
Fed food to consume and influence the mind
Sacrificial executions disguised as
Shootings and crimes, the news televises
"Who pulls the strings? Who has the dice?"
Asking these questions, I lose track of time
So I ask: "How human am I?"

[Chorus]
Maybe I'm blind
By human desire, human design
Just a little bit further 'til I arrive
Or is it just a mirage fooling my mind?
How foolish am I?
How foolish am I?
How foolish am I?
How foolish am I?
How foolish am I?

[Verse 1]
All the kids are throwing sticks
Politics
Nights on the wire
Everybody wants to get by
It's a test of the times
A test of my rights
It's on, pretty lady

[Verse 2]
Born to be angry
Grip of the vice
Click on the trigger, girl
Sip wine on ice
It's about time
Best to rewind
You better blow
(Pistols, pistols, pistols)

[Chorus]
Lights low
Go on baby go
It's about time
I'm on a tightrope
Don't go, go
It's about time, it's about time

[Verse 3]
Everybody come on
Lights on the beaches
Everybody come on, delight
Close the front door
I don't wanna go
Like I'm on the "Truman Show"
Best to let go
You don't wanna know
Ya better blow
(Pistols, pistols, pistols)

[Chorus]
Lights low
Go on baby go
It's about time
I'm on a tightrope
Don't go, go
It's about time, it's about

[Bridge]
All the years of paradise
Paradigms
Paralyze us
You're crazy
All the cards you've organized
Shuffled twice in front of my eyes
Everybody has
Needs, wants, a cold gun

[Chorus]
Lights low
Go on baby go
It's about time
I'm on a tightrope
Don't go, go
It's about time, it's about
(Pistols, pistols)

[Verse 1]
Crawl back to life
It's been far too long
Crystallized
Round interstellar moons
Seed of light into your atmosphere
What's your world like?

[Pre-Chorus]
Is the house we built still here?
Girl you know

[Chorus]
When the beat of my drum
Meets the beat of your heart
You know I couldn't love
Any other, any other
This is where I come from
This is where I belong
With the beat of your drum
Not any other

[Verse 2]
Fall through the sky
Little specks below
Magnify, the further down I go
I feel it in my bones
Can you feel it too?
Is this the world I've known?

[Pre-Chorus]
Is the house we built still here?
Is the human race sincere?

[Chorus]
When the beat of my drum
Meets the beat of your heart
You know I couldn't love
Any other, any other
This is where I come from
This is where I belong
With the beat of your drum
Not any other

[Verse 3]
Feel the force of time
Weighing down my mind
Tears you cry, screaming at the sky
Come outside, the rays are shining bright

[Bridge]
Not any other
Feels like home
Where I belong
I'm home

[Chorus]
When the beat of my drum
Meets the beat of your heart
You know I couldn't love
Any other, any other
This is where I come from
This is where I belong
With the beat of your drum
Not any other

[Hook]
I know one day, I won't have to wait in line
I know one day, I'ma get those keys to that new ride
I know one day I'll be fine
And I know one day I'll get mine
And I know one day
Hell it might be Monday

[Verse 1]
I remember thinkin': "Man, I need a decent ride"
And I won't have to ask my momma for the keys to drive
With my brother ridin' in an old Cutlass
Black and Mild lit, whole roof busted
Well who knows, maybe one day we'll have a little more
We'll finally shop somewhere else besides the corner store
My little sister say she gotta have a pair of Dior's
But right now they'll probably stop us 'fore we hit the door
My Uncle says: "That's how it is where we come from"
And if it weren't for bad luck, we wouldn't have none
Hard to tell the good days from the bad ones
If I could catch a shooting star then I'd grab one
I'd grab one, for real

[Hook]
I know one day, I won't have to wait in line
I know one day, I'ma get those keys to that new ride
I know one day I'll be fine
And I know one day I'll get mine
And I know one day
Hell it might be Monday

[Verse 2]
I remember feelin' trapped and no I couldn't get out
And when they laid my momma off, no it just didn't amount
I still remember how she looked when she walked into the house
But still she tried her best to show me what was Christmas about
And if we wanted hot water, we had to microwave it
And everyday the power'd cut off, but we'd tolerate it
The thoughts of all the beats I lost because I forgot to save 'em
I'm screaming at me in the mirror like: "I gotta make it!"
My teacher's tryna get through to me 'cause of my behavior
I said: "I got big dreams, and I gotta chase 'em"
I never cared a damn thing 'bout a college major
I only had one need, that was a lot of paper
But see, I never had a thing but a lotta prayers
After school, open mic night, rockin' stages
It all started from a demo, to a limo
From a limo, to a Lambo
And all of this came up out of Decatur
'Cause one day...

[Hook]
I know one day, I won't have to wait in line
I know one day, I'ma get those keys to that new ride
I know one day I'll be fine
And I know one day I'll get mine
And I know one day
Hell it might be Monday

[Interlude]
One day, one day, one day, one day
One day, one day, one day, one day

[Bridge]
I used to dream about these days and the things that I'd do
I had to get a new life, 'cause the old just won't do
I used to dream shades of grey, now the sky's shining blue
And everyday it feels like, there's no way I can lose

[Hook]
'Cause I knew one day, I wouldn't have to wait in line
I knew one day, I would get those keys to that new ride
I knew one day I'd be fine
And I knew one day I'd get mine
Yeah I knew one day
And not just Monday

[Underground Luxury Interview]

[Verse 1]
What kind of love just stays the same?
What kind of love don't die alone?
What kind of love would take this long?
What kind of love don't make you old?
Meet me at the studio
I just wanna play you something
Meet me at the studio
I just wanna tell you something
'Cause you satisfy my heart
Even though we'll fall apart
Can't remember how to start—little lies
You like to call me koala
I'll be your Simba, you're Nala
Wherever you go I'll follow—little lies

[Verse 2]
Drove for hours just to see your face
Sorry—
Drove for hours just to see your face
We should've talked if just to clear the space
But now we stare at each other
Buried whatever feeling that was
He texts to "keep your heart D-stacks, keep your heart
These girls are smart D-stacks, these girls are smart"
I know...
Why get a dog? It's just gonna die
Everything you love's just gonna leave you one day
And that's just real shit he can still spit
But what's the point?
I said a lot of stupid stuff
I think that I was growin' up

[Outro]
What kind of love don't hurt so bad?
What kind of love don't feel this way?
What kind of love would make me fold?
Little lies, little lies
Little lies, little lies
Little lies, little lies
Na, na-na, na, na-na, na-na
Little lies
I ran away in floods of shame
I'll never tell how close I came
As I cross the Holland road
You went left and I went right
As the moon hung proud and white
You would have loved it here tonight

Spin me round just to pin me down
On the cover of this strange bed
Spin me round just to pin me dowm

Roll out your questions keep them down
Let the water lead us home
And I was sorry for what I'd done

You were young I was not old
But our story was not told
But torn apart by greedy hands

Spin me round just to pin me down
On the cover of this strange bed
Spin me round just to pin me down
Spin me round just to pin me down
I'll be gone by the nights end
Spin me round just to pin me down

But I'll be home in a little while
Lover I'll be home
And I'll be home in a little while
Lover I'll be home

And I'll be home in a little while
Lover I'll be home
And I'll be home in a little while
Lover I'll be home

*It’s 2013 going into 2014. What do you see as your next obstacle? To get to the next level. What’s the next barrier that you need to break through?*

When I first got started as a artist, my dad told me, he said: "Now, you tryna show people that you know music, you know, how to make music, but pretty soon you gon’ wanna show people that you know people. And you can’t know people unless you know yourself." So, this self mastery becomes the obstacle
COUNTERCLAIMS OF THE BEASTIE BOYS PARTIES
For their Counterclaims against Plaintiff and Counterclaim-Defendant GoldieBlox, Inc. (“GoldieBlox”), Brooklyn Dust Music, Beastie Boys and Adam Horovitz (collectively, the “Beastie Boys Defendants”), together with Michael Diamond and Dechen Yauch as executor of the estate of Adam Yauch, deceased (collectively, with the Beastie Boys Defendants, the “Beastie Boys Parties”), aver as follows:


...Facts Applicable To All Counterclaims
11.	As an integral part of GoldieBlox’s marketing campaign to sell books and toys that it claims are designed to “inspire the next generation of female engineers” (a profession defined by innovation and original thinking), GoldieBlox has engaged in the systematic infringement of intellectual property from numerous popular music groups, including Beastie Boys.

12.	As part of that systematic campaign of infringement, GoldieBlox has created a series of video advertisements set to well-known songs from popular artists in an effort to achieve the company’s primary goal of selling toys.

13.	Upon information and belief, GoldieBlox has produced and published videos that infringe upon popular songs by Beastie Boys, Queen, Daft Punk, Kaskade, Krewella, Avicii, Slam, k.flay and Trevor Guthrie.

14.	In some instances, GoldieBlox has altered the lyrics of the popular songs featured in its video advertisements in order to tailor those songs to the company’s goal of selling toys.

15.	One of the popular songs that GoldieBlox altered for use in its video advertisements is “Girls,” the seventh and final single from the Beastie Boys’ 1987 debut album Licensed to Ill. “Girls” is a sarcastic anthem.

16.	Upon information and belief, on or about November 18, 2013 GoldieBlox published a video advertisement entitled “GoldieBlox, Rube Goldberg, & Beastie Boys ‘Princess Machine’” on its own website and uploaded it to the popular internet video website Youtube.com. (Hereinafter, the “GoldieBlox Advertisement”.) At or around that time, GoldieBlox began promoting the GoldieBlox Advertisement through, among other things, its accounts on the social media websites Twitter.com and Facebook.com.

17.	The GoldieBlox Advertisement posted on the GoldieBlox website and Youtube.com, as well as substantially all of GoldieBlox’s social media posts promoting the GoldieBlox Advertisement, used and explicitly referred to the Beastie Boys’ name and identity.

18.	The “Beastie Boys” name and identity is readily associated with Horovitz, Diamond and Yauch, both individually and collectively and have come to signify the musical, artistic, and other creations by Horovitz, Diamond and Yauch individually, as well as collectively under the name “Beastie Boys,” and to identify each of them as individual members of the recording and performing group Beastie Boys.
19.	The Beastie Boys Parties are the owners of the common law and registered trademark BEASTIE BOYS® for use with, among other things, musical sound recordings and video recordings featuring musical performances. The BEASTIE BOYS® mark is registered with the United States Patent & Trademark Office as U.S. Reg. No. 4,197,406, and has been in continuous use since 1982. That registration is valid and subsisting under 15 U.S.C. §§ 1051, et seq.

20.	The GoldieBlox Advertisement is of a commercial nature and used the Copyrighted Work and the BEASTIE BOYS® mark to advertise GoldieBlox’s products, without any of the Beastie Boys Parties’ consent or authorization.

21.	The GoldieBlox Advertisement featured the Beastie Boys musical composition “Girls” with lyrics modified to become a “jingle” to sell GoldieBlox’s products.

22.	The GoldieBlox Advertisement promptly became a viral hit on the internet, garnering over 8 million views on Youtube.com alone in just ten days. The GoldieBlox Advertisement also received massive coverage in the press, which primarily focused on its apparently, but not in fact, approved use of the Beastie Boys’ song.

23.	Upon information and belief, the publishing of the GoldieBlox Advertisement directly coincided with and directly resulted in a massive increase in the sales of GoldieBlox’s products.

24.	Upon information and belief, the publishing of the GoldieBlox Advertisement and GoldieBlox’s marketing strategy of infringing upon the Copyrighted Work directly resulted in the company’s product line being featured as one of the most popular toy lines for the 2013 holiday season on the internet shopping website Amazon.com.

25.	Upon information and belief, on or about November 20, 2013, a representative from an advertising agency contacted Universal Music Publishing Group (the administrator of Brooklyn Dust’s and Horovitz’s copyrights in the Copyrighted Work) to ascertain whether GoldieBlox had obtained a license from the Beastie Boys Parties and their publisher or their administrator for the use of the underlying song “Girls” in the GoldieBlox Advertisement. Upon information and belief, the request was made because the advertising agency was in the process of submitting the GoldieBlox Advertisement to a competition, sponsored by Intuit Inc., to win a 30-second television commercial spot during the 2014 Super Bowl.

26.	On November 21, 2013, counsel for the Beastie Boys Parties contacted counsel for GoldieBlox to inquire about the company’s use of the Beastie Boys song in the GoldieBlox Advertisement.

27.	On that very same day, GoldieBlox filed this action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.

28.	Upon information and belief, GoldieBlox achieved and continues to achieve additional publicity, press coverage, and, upon information and belief, greater sales of its products, as a direct result of the Beastie Boys’ perceived affiliation with the GoldieBlox Advertisement.

29.	Unfortunately, rather than developing an original advertising campaign to inspire its customers to create and innovate, GoldieBlox has instead developed an advertising campaign that condones and encourages stealing from others. Accordingly, the Beastie Boys Parties assert the following counterclaims.

[Verse 1]
Let's play a game
Let's just pretend like you don't know who I am
Believe it if you say that you're not a fan
Act like I'm interested in some other man, man, man
Turn on the lights (The lights)
So that the cameras flashing won't be so bright (So bright)
Ain't like the crowd ain't getting big outside (Outside)
They're wanting details on how I live my life, my life, my life

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no escape from the fame
To somewhere they don't know my name
I love you, I do feel your pain
But the question still remain

[Chorus]
Can you love somebody loved by everybody?
Can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?
Somebody loved by everybody
Can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?

Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl? (Everybody)
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl? (Everybody)
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl?

[Verse 2]
Out through the back (The back)
Too many people blocking the front door
We go our different ways, oh, we want more
Another gig I got don't end 'til four, four, four

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no escape from the fame
To somewhere they don't know my name
I love you, I do feel your pain
But the question still remain

[Chorus]
Can you love somebody loved by everybody?
Can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?
Somebody loved by everybody
Can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl? (Everybody)
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl? (Everybody)
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl? (Everybody)
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl?

[Bridge]
Can you hang onto a shooting star? (Star)
Handle distance near and far
Don't let the jealousy and envy get to you
'Cause I'll be running home right back to you

[Chorus]
Can you love somebody loved by everybody?
Can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?
Somebody loved by everybody
Can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl?
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl?
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl?
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl?

[Outro]
Can you love a girl? Can you love a girl?

[Chorus]

Give me all your heart and swap mine out with you
Swap it out with you, swap it out with you
Come into my world, I'll give my world to you, we can swap swap swap it out

[Verse 1]
I can show you what I'm talking about
Be obliged just to show you how

Swapping out ain't ever been a crime
If it was then I’d do the time

[Pre-Chorus]
Eye for an eye
Remember when I told you
"Wipe your pretty eyes, dry 'em on my shoulder"?

[Verse 2]
Oh swapping out will only change your life
It’s worth it, the sacrifice
After all what do we have to lose?

Don’t separate our destiny
By separating you from me
These are the terms
That were made for each other

[Pre-Chorus]
Eye for an eye
Remember when I told you

[Intro: Justin Bieber]
I love you, need you
Need you here to stay

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Girl you're on my mind like 24/7
Every single time that I'm not with you
If you spend the night, baby it could be heaven
Hit me on my line if you're tryna come through

[Pre-Hook: Justin Bieber]
I feel my heartbeat bumpin' to the bass
She give me butterflies and they won't go away
Under the stars, she took my hand and said
"I love you, need you, need you here to stay"

[Hook: Justin Bieber]
I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay
I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Every time you're distant, girl somethin' is missin'
And wish that I could fix it, I wish things were different
What else, what else? If you love me, girl then say it
Say what else, what else? If you wanna be my baby

[Pre-Hook: Justin Bieber]

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Is this what you want? The baddest
I know what you want, without askin'
I hit once, had to have it
I hit twice, it's a habit, don't get caught up in traffic
I heard that it's hazardous stormin' outside, let's do that on the mattress
I just keep askin, is it real, is it real? Look, tell me, is it real?
Yep, real enough to go and get it tatted
Give you flowers, now you look like you're on a pageant
I can take you to the crib, condo, or the cabin, what's up?
If you make it, I can make it happen, I can grant it
Don't you take my "grant it" though for granted
I know that's not your intent, we ain't even campin'
And to leave this bed I'mma need a fuckin' ransom
Man I got her screamin' "Finally Famous!" when we fly around
Never lie to you 'less I lie you down
I put the writin' on the wall, but you don't understand it all like we in Chinatown
We one and one, both one of ones, and when you put the twos together
That's not twenty-two, it's forever, I promise 20-20 couldn't even make it clearer
I swear, Sean Don

[Hook: Justin Bieber]
I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me

Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay
I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay

[Intro]
So girl
You just be honest with me
I know we can make this work
I love you
I know that you afraid, babe
But you don't need to be saved, babe
You just need someone who understands
And I think I need the same, babe

[Verse 1]
Show me where you at, let's keep it honest
Home is where you at and that's a promise
Open up and never keep it from us
Nothing left between us, baby, nothing
Tell me what you want, let's keep it gangsta
Tell me who created you, I'd thank her
Open up and never keep it from us
Nothing left between us, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Hopefully you'll give me a chance
All I want is love and romance
I wanna give it all
Give it all to you

[Chorus]
I wanna dream what you dream, go where you're going
I only have one life and I only wanna live it with you
I wanna sleep where you sleep, connect with your soul
The only thing I want in life, I only wanna live it with you
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
I only wanna live it with you
Only wanna live it with you

[Verse 2]
Tell me what you want, I can't believe it
I know that if we make it there's a reason
Sometimes the sun shines, baby
Sometimes it ain't breezy
I hope that maybe this time it may be different
I told you I'mma make it, that commitment
Yeah, you took your shot and didn't miss it
Ain't nothing more attractive than ambition

[Pre-Chorus]
Hopefully you'll give me a chance
All I want is love and romance
I wanna give it all
Give it all to you

[Chorus]
I wanna dream what you dream, go where you're going
I only have one life and I only wanna live it with you
I wanna sleep where you sleep, connect with your soul
The only thing I want in life, I only wanna live it with you
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
I only wanna live it with you
Only wanna live it with you

[Bridge]
If I came to your crib, would you open the door?
I don't wanna go down that road, no more
Said you wanted it bad, but girl I wanted it more
You're the only one I wanna be with, yeah, yeah yeah

[Chorus]
I wanna dream what you dream, go where you're going
I only have one life and I only wanna live it with you
I wanna sleep where you sleep, connect with your soul
The only thing I want in life, I only wanna live it with you
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
I only wanna live it with you
Only wanna live it with you

There’s aliens, I’m telling you there’s aliens

Still you wanna leave cause you feel alone

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You don’t know what they’re like, if they know that you’re alive
They’re gonna try to take away the secrets of your planet's life

But you gotta listen

Just put your dukes up, John

Struck dumb by good advice
Your integrity was bruised
Your celebrity a ruse
They pulled the rug from under
Made way for new pretenders

[Chorus]
(Change your tune and change your hair)
Put your dukes up, John

Put your dukes up, John

Change your tune and change your hair
Or you're not going anywhere

[Chorus]
(Change your tune and change your hair)
Put your dukes up, John
(Or you're not going anywhere)
Put your dukes up, John
(Change your tune and change your hair)
Put your dukes up, John
(Or you're not going anywhere)
Put your dukes up, John

[Outro]
(Change your tune and change your hair)
And be a C-Y-N-I-C
(Or you're not going anywhere)
And be a C-Y-N-I-C
(Change your tune and change your hair)
And be a C-Y-N-I-C
(Or you're not going anywhere)
And be a C-Y-N-I-C

[Verse 1]
There's such a sad love
Deep in your eyes
A kind of pale jewel
Open and closed
Within your eyes
I'll place the sky
Within your eyes

There's such a fooled heart
Beating so fast
In search of new dreams
A love that will last
Within your heart
I'll place the moon
Within your heart

[Chorus]
As the pain sweeps through
Makes no sense for you
Every thrill is gone
Wasn't too much fun at all
But I'll be there for you-ou-ou
As the world falls down
Falling
Falling down
Falling in love

[Verse 2]
I'll paint you mornings of gold
I'll spin you Valentine evenings
Though we're strangers until now
We're choosing the path
Between the stars
I'll leave my love
Between the stars

[Chorus]
As the pain sweeps through
Makes no sense for you
Every thrill is gone
Wasn't too much fun at all
But I'll be there for you-ou-ou
As the world falls down

[Outro]
Falling
As the world falls down
Falling
As the world falls down
Falling
Falling
Falling
Falling in love
As the world falls down
Falling
Falling
Falling
Falling
Falling in love
As the world falls down
Makes no sense at all
Makes no sense to fall
Falling
As the world falls down
Falling
Falling in love
As the world falls down
Falling
Falling
Falling in love
As the world falls down

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Jackie Chan glasses, Rush Hour traffic
Buffie the Body, the buffer the fattest
Hitted the fool now he riding in the trunk
Rumpin & Bumpin I might hit a bump
A million a month is a lost to a boss
Don’t pass me the blunt because I’m in a slump
Biggin' and juggin', bitch what do you want
I’m credit for dope til' the first of the month
Smoking a blunt and my trunk in the front
You like it or leave it, or leave it alone
Slick with the stick and I’m cool with the chrome
One hit of the bong and I leave it alone
Lean and Patron, I know that it’s wrong
I know that it’s wrong but I jugg on the phone
The day that it came, the day that it gone
Day to day business, cause dope with a tone
Gucci and Ziggy, we back in the business
My pockets my piggy, I’m back on my throne

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
My diamonds hit like Jackie Chan
My ring hit like Jackie Chan
My diamonds hit like Jackie Chan
My ring hit like Jackie Chan
My diamonds hit like Jackie Chan
My ring hit like Jackie Chan
My diamonds hit like Jackie Chan
My ring hit like Jackie Chan
Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan
Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan, Jackie Chan

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Jackie Chan, diamond wrists, kicking like Liu Kang
Bruce Wayne, Bentley coupe, karate chop my brain
Alligator bally, Versace, Versace, Versace my ring
The j’s they love the cocaine
They sniffing the dope off my ring
You know that I’m a magician
The packs I get it and flip it
This lean is killing my kidneys
These birds are singing like Whitney

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Call me Jackie, my diamonds kicking,
I Came a long way from that midget
To pullin' up in Honda Civics
To dropping that top on my Bentley
Them Rush Hour I'm gettin' them Benji
I’m smoking on Jackie, my eyes is chinky
My money is long like a slinky
I fuck with a bitch look like Pinky
I’m Jackie Chan in my city
Where ever I go, I’m good, I can kick it

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Gucci Mane]
My eyes look like Jackie Chan ‘cause I smoke that mary jane
My eyes look so Asian, man, ‘cause I’m smoking that purple thing
Gucci Mane got stupid Jordans
My kick game on Jackie Chan
Me, Chris Tucker, ride through Tucker
Got pulled over, cause we’re two black brothers
Chris Tucker stop laughin' man
This shit here ain’t funny man
Rush Hour traffic, smoking that cabbage
Two diamond rings, they Jackie Chan
Gucci got hands like Jackie Chan
Better yet, nigga Chuck Norris
Nigga told me he was back balling
Two weeks later he was back borrowin
Jackie Chan bitch, my bitch ballin'
Jackie Chan bitch, my bitch foreign
Put your hands up for the black man
Keep your eyes up for the black fan
Gucci Mane and Zay, we back man
Not Pac-Man, it’s Jackie Chan

[Hook]

[Outro]

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I've been watching for the signs
Took a trip to clear my mind, oh
Now I'm even more lost
And you're still so fine, oh my, oh my
Been having conversations about breakups and separations
I'm not feeling like myself since the baby
Are we gonna even make it? Oh
'Cause if we are, we're taking this a little too far
If we are, we're taking this a little too far
Baby, if we are, we're taking this a little too far
With me being wherever I'm at, worried about wherever you are
We're taking this a little too far
We're taking this a little too far
We're taking this a little too far

[Chorus 1: Drake]
Know you wanna roll with a good girl
Do it big, do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Don’t sleep when you know you got it good, girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl?
One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
Wassup?

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
On my mind, up past my bedtime, no rest at the kingdom
Alone in my place, my heart is away, all that I can think of is
We should get married, we should get married
Let's stop holding back on this and let's get carried away

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
Stop making a big deal out of the little things
'Cause I got big deals and I got little things
Got everything I'm asking for but you
Stop making a big deal out of the little things
Let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay

[Chorus 2: Drake & Beyoncé]
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
All I'm really asking for is you
You're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine
As long as you know who you belong to

[Chorus 1: Drake]
Know you wanna roll with a good girl
Do it big, do it all for a good girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Don’t sleep when you know you got it good, girl
One time, this is a song for the good girl
Wanna roll, wanna roll with a good girl?
One time, this is a song for the good girl
And I still keep it hood, still treat you like I should
Wassup?

[Verse 3: Drake]
From eight until late, I think ‘bout you
You own my nights, I don’t know what to do, do
I can't get no rest, can't get no sleep, yeah
This whole thing got way too deep and we should

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
Stop making a big deal out of the little things
'Cause I got big deals and I got little things
I got everything I'm asking for but you
Stop making a big deal out of the little things
Let's get carried away
Come right now, you know where I stay

[Chorus 2: Drake & Beyoncé]
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
I just wanna say, you're mine, you're mine
Fuck what you heard, you're mine, you're mine

[Verse 4: Drake]
(Pull up on you) I gotta pull up on you
You gon' make me have to pull up on you
Don't go ghost on me, I'ma go Thriller on you, I'ma just (Pull up on you)
I'ma let my hands do the talking when I see you, baby girl
I miss feeling on you, (Pull up on you) I miss everything that's real about you
And that's everything about you that's just how I feel about you (Pull up on you)
Been about you and I’m still about you but
We ain't finished talking (Pull up on you)
I told you you don’t need to worry 'bout them bitches
All them fives need to listen when the ten is talking (Pull up on you)
'Cause they don’t wanna see you happier than them
And girl, you swear they all ya friends and that's been a problem (Pull up on you)
You the one they hate, just come with that
I know you think it's funny that your ex is not a running back
But that nigga came running back
(Pull up on you) And you tell me you done with that
And I believe it's true
'Long as you know who you belong to

[Outro: Beyoncé]
All I’m really asking for is you
Yeah

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
When the palm of my two hands hold each other
That feels different
From when your hands are in mine
That's just the way it is
And when my voice is screaming out to my own ears
That feels different from when I hear yours
Now that's just the way it is
And when I'm standing in this mirror after all these years
What I'm viewing's a little different
From what your eyes show you
I guess I didn't see myself before you
Moving forward

[Bridge: Beyoncé & Frank Ocean]
(Superpower)
A subtle power
(Superpower)
A tough love
(Superpower)
Oh, like a shark
(Superpower)
Ooh, like a bear
A tough love

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Frank Ocean]
And I thought the world would move on
I thought the world would revolve
Without us, without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
Couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
'Cause nothing I know could break us down
They can't break us down

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
And just like you, I can be scared
Just like you, I hope I'm spared
But it's tough love
I know you feel it in the air
Even the babies know it's there: tough love (Superpower)
The laws of the world tell us what goes sky
And what falls, it's a superpower (Superpower)
The laws of the world never stopped us once
'Cause together we got plenty superpower

[Bridge: Beyoncé & Frank Ocean]
(Superpower)
A subtle power
(Superpower)
A tough love
(Superpower)
Oh, like a shark
(Superpower)
Ooh, too much to bear
(Superpower)

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Frank Ocean]
And I thought the world would move on
I thought the world would revolve
Without us, without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
Couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
But together we got plenty power
Nothing I know could break us down
They can't break us down

[Outro: Beyoncé & Frank Ocean]
Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down

[Verse 1]
Let me sit this ass on you, show you how I feel
Let me take this off, will you watch me
Yes, mass appeal
Don't take your eyes, don't take your eyes off it
Watch it, babe
If you like, you can touch me, baby
Do you, do you wanna touch me, baby?
Grab a hold, don't let go
Let me know, that you, ready
I just wanna show you now, slow it down, go around
You rock hard, I rock steady

[Chorus]
And rock right up to the side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep, baby, deep, baby, deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
And wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me, baby, me, baby, me

[Bridge]
Rock it 'til water falls
Rock it 'til water falls
Rock it 'til water falls
Bathe in these waterfalls

[Verse 2]
I do it like it's my profession
I gotta make a confession
I'm proud of all this bass, when you put it in your face
By the way, if you need a personal trainer or a therapist
I can be a piece of sunshine, inner peace, entertainer
Anything else that you may read between the lines
You and I create rockets and waterfalls

[Chorus]
So rock right up to the side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep, baby, deep, baby, deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
And wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me, baby, me, baby, me

[Interlude]
Hard, rock, steady, rock, hard, rock, steady
Rock, hard, rock, steady, rock, hard, rock, steady

[Verse 3]
Don't you know that I give you the loving if you need it?
I give you my word, you can believe it
Your love feels like all four seasons growing inside me
Life has a reason, swimming in my love, your love lifting
Higher, harder
Got me screaming to the Lord, boy
Kiss me, pray we don't overflow
Baby, I know you can feel it pulse
Keeping the peak of my waterfall
Rock it, baby, rock it, baby, rock it 'til the water falls
Damn

[Verse 4]
I can't help but love the way we make love
Daddy, daddy
Ooh child, ooh now, yes Lord, damn baby
You driving me cray, cray
You ain't right for doing it to me like that, daddy
Even though I've been a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad girl
Tell me what you're gon' do about that
Punish me, please
Punish me, please
Daddy, what you gon' do with all this ass
All up in your face?
Yeah, hell yeah, love me so deep
Ooh, my shit's so good, it ain't even right
I know I'm right
Hell yeah, you the shit
That's why you're my equivalent
So sexy
We're so much more than pointless fixtures
Instagram pictures, consumers
What about that ching-ching-ching
Wanna rock that, wanna rock that ching-ching
Baby boomers, baby, baby, baby, baby
Cyclical trends, tryna fit in
Home is where the heart is
Goddamnit, I'm comfortable in my skin
And you're comfortable in my skin
You look so comfortable in my skin
Rockets and waterfalls

[Outro]
Damn

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I've been drinkin', I've been drinkin'
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinkin', I've been thinkin'
Why can't I keep my fingers off it?
Baby, I want you, now-now
Why can't I keep my fingers off you?
Baby, I want you, na na
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feelin' like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashin' lights, flashin' lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, na na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na na
Drunk in love, I want you

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
We woke up in the kitchen
Saying, "How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh, baby
Drunk in love
We be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies
Grindin' up in that club
Drunk in love

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
We be all night, and everything all right
No complaints from my body
So fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinkin', park it in my lot, 7-11
I'm rubbin' on it, rub-rubbin'
If you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinkin', get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out
Like washrags, he wet it up
Boy, I'm drinkin', I'm singin'
On the mic to my boy toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway
Then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Grainin' on that wood
Grainin'-grainin' on that wood
I'm swervin' on that, swervin'-swervin' on that
Big body been servin' all this
Swerve, surfin' all in this good-good
Hahaha!

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
We woke up in the kitchen
Saying, "How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh, baby
Drunk in love
We be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies
Grindin' up in that club
Drunk in love

[Chorus: Beyoncé & JAY-Z]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
I'm nice right now… Hold up!

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
That D'USSÉ is the shit, if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house
Time to back up all of that mouth
That you had all in the car
Talkin' 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talkin' 'bout you be reppin' that Third
I wanna see all that shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood
Hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight, catch a charge I might
Beat the box up, like Mike in '97, I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no, I don't play
"Now eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
Said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae!"
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights
You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights
Sleep tight, we sex again in the morning
Your breasteses is my breakfast
We goin' in, we be all night

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
I'm never tired, never tired
I been sippin', that's the only thing
That's keepin' me on fire, we on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire
I've been drinkin', watermelon
I want your body right here
Daddy, I want you, right now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Intro: Harvey Keitel & Beyoncé]
Ms. Third Ward, your first question:
What is your aspiration in life?
Oh, well, my aspiration in life would be... to be happy

[Verse 1]
Mama said, "You're a pretty girl
What's in your head, it doesn't matter
Brush your hair, fix your teeth
What you wear is all that matters"

[Pre-Chorus]
Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down, down

[Chorus]
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
We try to fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery

[Verse 2]
Blonder hair, flat chest
TV says bigger is better
South beach, sugar free
Vogue says thinner is better

[Pre-Chorus]
Just another stage, pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down, down

[Chorus]
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
We try to fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery

[Bridge]
Ain’t got no doctor or pill that can take the pain away
The pain's inside and nobody frees you from your body
It's the soul, it's the soul that needs surgery
(It's my soul that needs surgery)
Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far
Then you break when the fake façade leaves you in the dark
You're left with shattered mirrors and the shards of a beautiful past

[Chorus]
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery

[Outro]
When you're alone all by yourself
And you're lying in your bed
Reflection stares right into you
Are you happy with yourself?
You stripped away the masquerade
The illusion has been shed
Are you happy with yourself?
Are you happy with yourself?
Yeah, yes (Ah, ah, ah)

[Intro: Sample]
"Flight controllers here looking very carefully at the situation
Obviously a major malfunction"

[Verse 1]
Your love is bright as ever
Even in the shadows
Baby, kiss me
Before they turn the lights out
Your heart is glowing
And I’m crashing into you
Baby, kiss me
Before they turn the lights out
Before they turn the lights out
Baby, love me lights out

[Chorus]
In the darkest night hour (In the darkest night hour)
I'll search through the crowd (Search through the crowd)
Your face is all that I see
I've given you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out
(XO)
You can turn my lights out

[Verse 2]
We don’t have forever
Baby, daylight’s wasting
You better kiss me
Before our time has run out
Nobody sees what we see
They’re just hopelessly gazing
Oh, baby, take me
Before they turn the lights out
Before our time has run out
Baby, love me lights out

[Chorus]
In the darkest night hour (In the darkest night hour)
I'll search through the crowd (I'll search through the crowd)
Your face is all that I see
I'll give you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out
You can turn my lights out

[Bridge]
I love you like XO
You love me like XO
You kill me boy, XO
You love me like XO
All that I see
Give me everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out
You can turn my lights out

[Chorus]
In the darkest night hour (In the darkest night hour)
I'll search through the crowd (I'll search through the crowd)
Your face is all that I see
I'll give you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out
You can turn my lights out
Part 1: Ghost

[Intro: Beyoncé & Alaina Reed-Hall]
The winner is Beyoncé Knowles: female pop vocalist!
I would like to thank the judges for picking me
My parents who I love, I love you, Houston

[Verse 1]
And I've been drifting off on knowledge
Cat-calls on cat-walks, man these women getting solemn
I could sing a psalm for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wonder: how come?
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge, I preach my gut it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls cause all the shit I hear is boring
All the shit I do is boring, all these record labels boring
I don't trust these record labels, I'm torn
All these people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
All the people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive, how come?

[Chorus]
What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around
What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around
What goes up ghost around
Ghost around, around, around, around

[Bridge]
Around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around (Will it be forever?)
Around, around, around, around (What are you gonna do?)
Around, around, around, around (What are you gonna do?)
Around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around
Around, around, around, around

[Outro]
Soul not for sale
Probably won't make no money off this, oh well
Reap what you sow
Perfection is so, mmm

Part 2: Haunted

[Verse 1]
It's what you do, it's what you see
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
It's where we go, it's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be on to me
My haunted lungs, ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm onto you, you must be haunting me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm onto you, I'm on to you
Onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be on to me

[Bridge]
You want me? I walk down the hallway
You like it? The bedroom's my runway
Slap me! I'm pinned to the doorway
Kiss, bite, foreplay

[Verse 2]
My haunted lungs, ghost in the sheets
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
My wicked tongue, where will it be?
I know if I'm onto you, you must be onto me
It's what we see
I know if I'm haunting you, you must be haunting me
It's where we go, it's where we'll be
I know if I'm onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, I'm onto you
Onto you, you must be onto me
You must be onto me
You must be onto me
You must be onto me

[Outro]
On to you, I'm on to you
On to you, I'm on to you
On to you, I'm on to you
On to you, I'm on to you
Me, me, me

[Part 1: "Yoncé"]

[Intro]
Let me hear you say, "Hey, Ms. Carter!" (Hey, Ms. Carter!)
Say, "Hey, Ms. Carter!" (Hey, Ms. Carter!)
Give me some!

[Verse 1]
See me up in the club with fifty-'leven girls
Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sitting low
Every boy in here with me got that smoke
Every girl in here got to look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up, tell me how I'm looking, babe

[Bridge]
Boy, this all for you, just walk my way
Just tell me how it's looking, babe
Just tell me how it's looking, babe
(How it's looking, babe?)
I do this all for you, baby, just take aim
And tell me how it's looking, babe
(How it's looking, babe?)
Tell me how it's looking, babe, looking, babe

[Verse 2]
Drop the bass, mane, the bass get lower
Radio say "Speed it up", I just go slower
High like treble, pumping on the mids
Ya man ain't ever seen a booty like this
And why you think ya keep my name rolling off the tongue
'Cause when he wanna smash, I'll just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor

[Hook]
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Like, like liquor, like, like, like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor
Like, like liquor, like, like, like liquor

[Outro]
Beyoncé, Beyoncé?
Are you happy to be in Paris? Are you happy to be in Paris?
Beyoncé, Beyoncé? Beyoncé!

[Intro]
Driver, roll up the partition, please

[Verse 1]
Driver, roll up the partition, please
I don't need you seeing 'Yoncé on her knees
Took forty-five minutes to get all dressed up
We ain't even gonna make it to this club
Now my mascara running, red lipstick smudged
Oh, he so horny, yeah, he want to fuck
He popped all my buttons, and he ripped my blouse
He Monica Lewinsky'd all on my gown

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh there, daddy, daddy didn’t bring the towel
Oh, baby, baby, we better slow it down
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up
And we ain't even gon' make it to this club

[Chorus]
Take all of me, I just wanna be the girl you like
The kind of girl you like
Take all of me, I just wanna be the girl you like
The kind of girl you like is right here with me

[Pre-Verse]
Driver, roll up the partition fast (Hey)

[Verse 2]
Driver, roll up the partition fast
Over there, I swear I saw them cameras flash
Handprints and footprints on my glass
Handprints and good grips all on my ass
Private show with the music blasting
He like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty
Red wine drip, we’ll talk that trash
Chauffeur eavesdropping, trying not to crash

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh there, daddy, daddy didn’t bring the towel
Oh, baby, baby, we better slow it down
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up
We ain't even gonna make it to this club

[Chorus]
Take all of me, I just wanna be the girl you like
The kind of girl you like
Take all of me, I just wanna be the girl you like
The kind of girl you like is right here with me (Hello!)

[Bridge]
Est-ce que tu aimes le sexe?
Le sexe, je veux dire: l'activité physique, le coït. Tu aimes ça?
Tu ne t'intéresses pas au sexe?
Les hommes pensent que les féministes détestent le sexe mais c'est une activité très stimulante et naturelle que les femmes adorent

[Chorus]
Take all of me, I just wanna be the girl you like
The kind of girl you like
Take all of me, I just wanna be the girl you like
The kind of girl you like is right here with me (Hello!)

[Outro]
Bzz-bzz-bzz-bzz-bzz-bzzwop

Sometimes, these walls seem to cave in on me
When I look in your eyes, I feel alive
Some days, we say words that don't mean a thing
But when you're holding me tight, I feel alive

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Make it last forever
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me?
You and I together

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Each day, I feel so blessed to be looking at you

When I'm holding you tight, I'm so alive
Now let's live it up

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Make it last forever
Come on, baby, won't you hold on to me, hold on to me?

[Verse 1]
I'm in my penthouse half-naked
I cooked this meal for you naked
So where the hell you at?
Just one shot left of this drink, in this glass
Don't make me break it
I wish that you were me
So you could feel this feeling
I never broke one promise
And I know when you're not honest
Now you got me yelling, that's because I'm jealous

[Chorus]
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous

[Post-Chorus]
Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I never ever do
So I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
"Baby girl, you can't survive like this"

[Verse 2]
Take it one step further, freakum dress out my closet
Yoncé fillin' out this skirt, I look damn good, I ain't lost it
And I ain't missed a beat, boy, you been hanging out at night
Tonight I'm staying out 'til tomorrow
Dancing on them tables, ain't got no cares, no sorrows
I ran into my ex, said what up to his besties
Now we reminiscing how we used to flex in Texas, don't be jealous

[Chorus]
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous

[Post-Chorus]
Sometimes I wanna walk in your shoes
Do the type of things that I never ever do
I take one look in the mirror and I say to myself
"Baby girl, you can't survive like this, no, no, no"

[Bridge]
And I hate you for your lies and your covers
And I hate us for making good love to each other
And I love making you jealous but don't judge me
And I know that I'm being hateful but that ain't nothing
That ain't nothing
I'm just jealous, I'm just human, don't judge me

[Chorus]
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine
Oh, I'm jealous

[Intro]
I love your face
You love the taste
That sugar babe, it melts away

[Verse 1]
I kiss you and you lick your lips, I kiss you and you lick your lips
You like it wet and so do I, you like it wet and so do I
I know you never waste a drip, I know you never waste a drip
I wonder how it feels sometimes
Mmm, must be good to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep me coming, keep me going, keep me coming, keep me going
Keep me humming, keep me moaning, keep me humming, keep me moaning
Don't stop loving 'til the morning, don't stop loving 'til the morning
Don't stop screaming, freaking, blowing

[Chorus]
I'm out that H-Town, comin'— comin' down
I'm comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground
H—H-Town—Town, I'm comin' down
Comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground

[Verse 1: Beyoncé & Jay-Z]
I know when you were little girls
You dreamt of being in my world
Don't forget it, don't forget it
Respect that, bow down, bitches (Crown)
I took some time to live my life
But don't think I'm just his little wife
Don't get it twisted, get it twisted
This my shit, bow down, bitches

[Part 2: ***Flawless]

[Intro: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]
We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: "You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man"
Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important (C—Candy on the ground)
Now, marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support (Dum-dah-de-da)
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage and we don't teach boys the same? (Do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da)
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing (Com—Com—Comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground)
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are (Dum-dah-de-da)
Feminist: A person who believes in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes (Do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da)

[Chorus: Beyonce]
You wake up, flawless, post up, flawless
Riding 'round in it, flawless, flossin' on that, flawless
This diamond, flawless, my diamond, flawless
This rock, flawless, my Roc, flawless
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies, tell 'em
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies, tell 'em
Say, "I look so good tonight" (Right— Right— Right—)
Goddamn, Goddamn
Say, "I look so good tonight" (Right— Right— Right—)
Goddamn, Goddamn, Goddamn!

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
My mama taught me good home training
My daddy taught me how to love my haters
My sister told me I should speak my mind
My man make me feel so Goddamn fine, I'm flawless!

[Chorus: Beyonce]
You wake up, flawless, post up, flawless
Riding 'round in it, flawless, flossin' on that, flawless
This diamond, flawless, my diamond, flawless
This rock, flawless, my Roc, flawless
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies, tell 'em
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies, tell 'em

Goddamn, Goddamn
Say, "I look so good tonight" (Right— Right— Right—)
Goddamn, Goddamn, Goddamn!

Congratulations, we'll see you next week"

[Verse 1]
Baby put your arms around me
Tell me I'm a problem
Know I'm not the girl you thought you knew and that you wanted
Underneath the pretty face is something complicated
I come with a side of trouble
But I know that's why you're staying

[Chorus]
Because you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby

[Verse 2]
No I'm not an angel either, but at least I'm trying
I know I drive you crazy, but would you rather that I be a machine
Who doesn't notice when you late or when you're lying
I love you even more than who I thought you were before

[Chorus]
Because you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby

[Bridge]
Tell me, do you wanna ride?
Tell me, do you wanna ride?
Ride around, ride around
Ride around
We ride around in that H-town
Keep those candles in your bed, no need for the spell
Stop acting so scared, just do what I tell
First, both of my legs go back on your head
And whatever you want
Yeah, baby, I'll bet it comes true

[Verse 1]
Baby put your arms around me
Tell me I'm a problem
Know I'm not the girl you thought you knew and that you wanted
Underneath the pretty face is something complicated
I come with a side of trouble
But I know that's why you're staying

[Chorus]
Because you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby
'Cause you're no angel either, baby

So tell me your secrets
I just can't stand to see you leaving

[Chorus]
But Heaven couldn't wait for you
No, Heaven couldn't wait for you
Heaven couldn't wait for you
No, Heaven couldn't wait for you
So go on, go home

We laughed at the darkness
So scared that we lost it
We stood on the ceilings
You showed me love was all you needed

Heaven couldn't wait for you

[Intro]
Yeah, woo, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
You're looking just a little too hard at me
Standing just a little too close to me
You're saying not quite enough to me
You're sipping just a little too slow for me
No doubt you play it real cool, homie
Got me thinking what is it you do for me?
Tripping (Tripping) a little more than I should be
So let yourself go and get right with me

[Chorus]
I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, we can get right
(We can get right)
I'm about to fill your cup, so we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, tonight
(We can get right)

[Post-Chorus]
Here I come
Here I come
Here I come
Here I come...

[Verse 2]
Your lips talking 'bout I, "Play too much"
Can't a woman take advantage of what she wants?
My hips moving, oh, so slow (So slow)
Bar tab looking like a car note (Car note)
All I need is you here right by my side (Woo)
Take whatever you want, baby, let's ride (Oh)
And whatever you won't do, let me decide
Just put your name on the dotted line

[Chorus]
I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, we can get right (Yeah)
(We can get right)
I'm about to fill your cup, so we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, tonight

[Bridge]
So much we've got to say, but so little time
And if tonight ain't long enough, don't leave love behind
(Don't leave this love behind)
Baby, take my hand, I'll show you why

I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, we can get right

[Verse 1]
Down in the workshop, all the elves were making toys
For the good Gentile girls and the good Gentile boys
When the boss busted in, nearly scared them half to death
Had a rifle in his hands and cheap whiskey on his breath
From his beard to his boots, he was covered with ammo
Like a big fat drunk disgruntled Yuletide Rambo
And he smiled as he said with a twinkle in his eye
"Merry Christmas to all! Now you're all gonna die!"

[Chorus]
The night Santa went crazy
The night Saint Nick went insane
Realized he'd been getting a raw deal
Something finally must have snapped in his brain

[Verse 2]
Well, the workshop is gone now—he decided to bomb it
Everywhere you'll find pieces of Cupid and Comet
And he tied up his helpers, and he held the elves hostage
And he ground up poor Rudolph into reindeer sausage
He got Dancer and Prancer with an old German Luger
And he slashed up Dasher just like Freddy Krueger
And he picked up a flamethrower and he barbecued Blitzen
And he took a big bite and said, "It tastes just like chicken!"

[Chorus]
The night Santa went crazy
The night Kris Kringle went nuts
Now you can hardly walk around the North Pole
Without stepping in reindeer guts

[Bridge]
There's the National Guard and the FBI
There's a van from the Eyewitness News
And helicopters circlin' 'round in the sky
And the bullets are flyin', the body count's risin'
And everyone's dyin' to know ... oh Santa, why?
My, my, my, my, my, my
You used to be such a jolly guy

[Verse 3]
Yes, Virginia, now Santa's doing time
In a federal prison for his infamous crime
Hey, little friend now, don't you cry no more tears
He'll be out with good behavior in seven hundred more years
But now Vixen's in therapy, and Donner's still nervous
And the elves all got jobs working for the postal service
And they say Mrs. Claus, she's on the phone every night
With her lawyer, negotiating the movie rights

They're talkin' 'bout

[Chorus]
The night Santa went crazy
The night Saint Nicholas flipped
Broke his back for some milk and cookies
Sounds to me like he was tired of gettin' gypped

Wo-oh, the night Santa went crazy
The night Saint Nick went insane
Realized he'd been getting a raw deal
Something finally must have snapped in his brain
Wo-oh, something finally must have snapped in his brain
Tell ya, something finally must have snapped... in his brain

[Verse 1]
So wicked in the way he moves
Don't miss it
Do not be a fool

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a long way, it's a long way home
Light inside of me
It ignites my bones

[Chorus]
He comes to me in my dreams
And tells me what I need to know
He makes me feel so at ease
And guides me to the lights above
I just wanna fall into his arms tonight
Someone tell me I, I will be alright
Hold on tight

[Verse 2]
Remembering, I forever will
Surrendering, just to how we felt

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a long way
It's a long way home
Light inside of me
It ignites my bones

[Chorus]
He comes to me in my dreams
And tells me what I need to know
He makes me feel so at ease
And guides me to the lights above
I just wanna fall into his arms tonight
Someone tell me I, I will be alright
Hold on tight

[Bridge]
And when it's all the thunder and rain
The cinema is fading away
I gotta make my way through the night
Holding on with all of my might
And when I'm lost, and I can't find the way
I feel the pieces breaking away
Hug myself with all of my might
Don't let go, just hold on tight

[Chorus]
He comes to me in my dreams
And tells me what I need to know
He makes me feel so at ease
And guides me to the lights above
I just wanna fall into his arms tonight
Someone tell me I, I will be alright
Hold on tight

[Verse]
On a shameless night, in a nameless place
I thought that love was a hopeless case
'Til I found you
'Til I found you
Lived a wasteful life in a hateful city
There was no love just pain and pity
'Til I found you
'Til I found you

[Pre-Chorus]
And you don't know how you saved me
And you don't know what you gave me
And you don't know how you saved my life

[Chorus]
I can see the light
I have flown away
I have come alive
I am blown away
I have felt the love
I can see the truth
Now that I found you
Now that I found you
I can live my life
I believe in faith
I have found myself
I have lost the hate
I have felt the love
I can see the truth
Now that I found you
Now that I found you

[Verse]
On a shameless night, in a nameless place
I thought that love was a hopeless case
'Til I found you
'Til I found you
Lived a wasteful life in a hateful city
There was no love just pain and pity
'Til I found you
'Til I found you

[Pre-Chorus]
And you don't know how you saved my life

[Chorus]
I can see the light
I have flown away
I have come alive
I am blown away
I have felt the love
I can see the truth
Now that I found you
Now that I found you

[Bridge]
All my life I've waited for this day
Have waited for you, now I adore you
All my life I've waited for this day
Have waited for you, now I adore you

[Chorus]
I can see the light
I have flown away
I have come alive
I am blown away
I have felt the love
I can see the truth
Now that I found you
Now that I found you

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Ahem
Microphone check, one-two, one-two
Hey, haha
I figured I'd get funky for a second if that's okay with y'all
Uh-huh, uh-huh
It go, it go
Hey, hey, look, uh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
They probably used to this Jewish kid foolin' with the music shit
Ludacrisly move a bitch, she feel it in her uterus
I'm generous and clever with this effort, so intelligent
Sentence wreckin' in seconds, invest in it for the hell of it
Tell a bitch she outie if you smell a fish, hell no
Hand her soap and tell her, "Go and get it fixed"
Never hear the end of it
Laughin' with your friends like some degenerates
But be nice, these females' feelings are kind of delicate
Never get the etiquette
Boy, I'm a asshole
Five-star restaurant, smokin' green tobacco
And TreeJ only eat it with Tabasco
He never try that tuna-noodle casserole
Ha-ha-ha, he-he-he, what the fuck was that?
Mothafucka, I'm skeed
Learned to smoke weed before I ever learned to read
Hey kids, you can be just like me

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
And now we go front, back, side to side
Everybody just glide
If you gettin' high, throw your hands in the sky
And do that shit one more time
Say we go front, back, side to side
Everybody just glide
If you gettin' high, throw your hands in the sky
Tell the person to your left that you're fly (I'm fly)

[Verse 2: Palermo Stone]
So fly, baby, buzzin' like an insect
Buggin' every track that I infest, been best
Simple intellect, feelin' that I've been up next
Feeling all the interest in puttin' all the hate to rest
No atheist, but self-made
Great team, we just trying to get ourselves paid
Never been on E, all my boosters pump gas for me
Gassed up like a Hummer for the summer
And everything I did was a runner for the numbers
All the critics got a woody, the foundation with the lumber
Fronters, will never get no shine
Y'all struggle through life, and we just gon' glide
Hop on the bandwagon, squeeze for the ride
Trees for the trip, beans for my high
Reach for the sky, yeah, it's worth a try
But you still couldn't touch a man this fly

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
And now we go front, back, side to side
Everybody just glide
If you gettin' high, throw your hands in the sky
And do that shit one more time
Say we go front, back, side to side
Everybody just glide
If you gettin' high, throw your hands in the sky
Tell the person to your left that you're fly (I'm fly)

[Hook]
My heat too hard, I'm scarin' 'em
Forreal, not only holding we bust
Err'Day in the street my heat too hard, I'm scarin' 'em
Forreal, not only holding we bust
Err'Day in the street my heat too hard, I'm scarin' 'em
Forreal, not only holding we bust

I'm a pimped out nigga that walk with canes
Talk with slang, who ball from New York to Spain

[Verse 1]
Here's the issues, pistols next to what I piss through
I speak, get it clear like lalique crystals
Keep a vigil, your peeps want me to sleep where the fish do
So when I sleep I keep my eyes open like a fish do
So official, he's a gift too, give to them who ah
Wanna see me in hell like breathin' in
With nines to blow my mind like Eve and Gwen
Don't speak to him, he get offended by words
And send in them birds to get him disturbed
While they got in their cars and protectin' their pockets like
Revenge of The Nerd, ob-serve, games I play no like
Injured ankle, pulled hamstring glass half empty but full canteen
They always wanna rub you off when you lamping but...

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
It's the young capital, L-U from the Avenue
Brush natural(???) in suttin' plus casual
Lay a mac to get the mackerel(???), hush mad atchu
Plus bullet stack crush clavicle and other bones
Run up in ya mother homes, still in the office hustle on
I got the forte of a young Boston Jorge who want horse play?
Thorough Breds wit colt 45's in a Porsche
Bring it to your doorway, we all from the streets
But you do it the Broadway, you know? The kid handle who
Toys better, you better play right like Andrew Lloyd Webber
Never, change when I'm back at the source
Niggas chains in the back of the Source
So I gotta watch for that rob report, rock watches out the Robb Report
And cop copper out the cop revolver

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
This the nigga that, push lambs in brook-land
Party with thieves, keep geneves at inner in the sleeve
And cook grams, you wanna see me oxed up, propped up
Judge cotched up over my cases, me and K Swiss, please
Small drop for the races, rocks for the bracelets
Glocks for the waist, you ain't want what I pulled out
The dressing draw, get pulled out like dresser draws
Now undress till you draw, raw salmonella, 40 cal. Carrera
Excel-or, right on top like umbrella, wait young fella
Hold your horses like Trojan forces, of course this is
Scarriets (???), ya'll sweet like chariots, I move work
Like Marriotts(???), still pimpin', hustlin' in the same
Clothes like the Simpsons, niggas keep your distance

[Hook 2x]

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Yeah, you know I love havin' a studio at home
Because right when I walk in the booth
You know I, I take a sip of my drink
You know like, light a cigarette and walk up to the mic
And it's exactly the correct height for me
That really just makes me feel comfortable
You know, lets the mind be at ease
And I, I noticed that, that uh, sometimes I, I rap with my rollie on
And sometimes I take it off

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
You ain't gotta worry if you're cold
Promise, baby, I'll be there by tomorrow
From the beginnin', I'll be down for it all
'Cause I ain't seen nobody like you, and
You look so good, when you walk by
I had to stop, you blew my high
A real angel, bring it back to Earth

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Hi, I'm sitting in the clouds
Everything around seems different to me now
And this could be a change for the both of us
Get away from the world that's controllin' us
It's only just me, I hope you trust me
You look a little nervous, keep adjusting
Your blouse that you got on
The buttons come undone
Let me know if you need me to put a fan on
I stand on the floor, 'bout to collapse
The bliss turns to war, heart turns to ash
Fun turns to drugs, the idea of cash
Has taken away my mind
And I think that it's a sign that
Your beauty handed me my mind back
My conscious will attempt to dissolve
I do some shit I won’t remember at all

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
You ain't gotta worry if you're cold
Promise, baby, I'll be there by tomorrow
From the beginnin', I'll be down for it all
'Cause I ain't seen nobody like you, and
You look so good, when you walk by
I had to stop, you blew my high
A real angel, bring it back to Earth

[Verse 2: Future]
Ayy, what's up, A? Check in
Ayy, my eyes open (Open,) but I'm barely awake (Future)
They say my codeine purple (Purple,) and your beauty is ayy (Ayy)
That beauty takin' me away (Space,) I'm smokin' on that good Cali
I'm gettin' higher than Hollywood, get deeper than the valley
As you get lower than lowrider, your favorite ghost writer (Could be)
We jumpin' the gun (Gun,) I might go over beyond
Purchase a one-way ticket, don't know when you'll return (Come here)
I need to roll me a blunt, 'cause you done blew this joint (Ha)
They say the stars all line up (Line,) then they bring out the sun (Sun)
Hey, this a red carpet event (What?,) I'ma bring out that one
She so sophisticated, I brought her presidential rollies
I'm no longer faded (Ayy), she got me sober off of conversation (Turn up)
I'm no longer faded (Ayy), she got me sober off of conversation (Turn up)

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
You ain't gotta worry if you're cold
Promise, baby, I'll be there by tomorrow
From the beginnin', I'll be down for it all
'Cause I ain't seen nobody like you, and
You look so good, when you walk by
I had to stop, you blew my high
A real angel, bring it back to Earth

[Verse 1]
Zephyr in the sky at night, I wonder
Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun?
She's got herself a universe gone quickly
For the call of thunder threatens everyone

[Chorus]
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

[Verse 2]
Faster than the speeding light she's flying
Trying to remember where it all began
She's got herself a little piece of heaven
Waiting for the time when Earth shall be as one

[Chorus]
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel

[Post-Chorus]
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light
Quicker than a ray of light

[Verse 3]
Zephyr in the sky at night, I wonder
Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun?
She's got herself a universe gone quickly
For the call of thunder threatens everyone

[Middle 8]
And I feel
Quicker than a ray of light, then gone for
Someone else will be there
Through the endless years

[Outro]
She's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universe
She's got herself a universe
And I feel
And I feel
And I feel like I just got home
And I feel
Quicker than a ray of light, she's flying
Quicker than a ray of light, I'm flying

[Verse 1]
Put your head on my shoulder, baby
Things can't get any worse
Night is getting colder
Sometimes life feels like it's a curse

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't carry these sins on my back
Don't wanna carry any more
I'm gonna carry this train off the track
I'm gonna swim to the ocean floor

[Chorus]
Mmmm
Crash to the other shore
Mmmm
Swim to the ocean floor

[Verse 2]
Children killing children
While the students rape their teachers
Comets fly across the sky
While the churches burn their preachers

[Pre-Chorus]
We can't carry these sins on our back
Don't wanna carry any more
We're gonna carry this train off the track
We're gonna swim to the ocean floor

[Chorus]
Mmmm
Crash to the other shore
Mmmm
Swim to the ocean floor

[Bridge]
Let the water wash over you
Wash it all over you
Swim to the ocean floor
So that we can begin again
Wash away all our sin
Crash to the other shore
Mmmm

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't carry these sins on my back
Don't wanna carry any more
I'm gonna carry this train off the track
I'm gonna swim to the ocean floor

[Chorus]
Mmmm
Crash to the other shore
Mmmm
Swim to the ocean floor

[Pre-Chorus]
We can't carry these sins on our back
Don't wanna carry any more
We're gonna carry this train off the track
We're gonna swim to the ocean floor

[Outro]
Crash to the other shore
Swim to the ocean floor
Mmmm
Mmmm

[Intro: Jesse Pearson]
(You see)

[Verse 1: Madonna]
I traded fame for love
Without a second thought
It all became a silly game
Some things cannot be bought
I got exactly what I asked for
Wanted it so badly
Running, rushing back for more
I suffered fools so gladly
And now, I find
I've changed my mind

[Sample: Jesse Pearson]
(You see)

[Chorus: Madonna]
The face of you
My substitute for love
My substitute for love
Should I wait for you?
My substitute for love
My substitute for love

[Sample: Jesse Pearson]
(You see)

[Verse 2: Madonna]
I traveled 'round the world
Looking for a home
I found myself in crowded rooms
Feeling so alone
I had so many lovers
Who settled for the thrill
Of basking in my spotlight
I never felt so happy

[Chorus: Madonna]
The face of you
My substitute for love
My substitute for love
Should I wait for you?
My substitute for love
My substitute for love

[Bridge: Madonna]
Mmm, ooh, mmm
Famous faces, far off places
Trinkets I can buy
No handsome stranger, heady danger
Drug that I can try
No Ferris wheel, no heart to steal
No laughter in the dark
No one-night stand, no far-off land
No fire that I can spark
Mmm, mmm

[Chorus: Madonna]
The face of you
My substitute for love
My substitute for love, mmm
Should I wait for you?
My substitute for love
My substitute for love

[Sample: Jesse Pearson]
(You see)

[Outro: Madonna]
Now I find I've changed my mind
This is my religion

[Intro]
Cherish, cherish

[Verse 1]
So tired of broken hearts and losing at this game
Before I start this dance
I take a chance in telling you
I want more than just romance
You are my destiny
I can't let go, baby, can't you see?
Cupid, please take your aim at me

[Chorus]
Cherish the thought
Of always having you here by my side
Oh baby, I cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life
I'm always singing it, cherish your strength
You got the power to make me feel good
And baby, I perish the thought
Of ever leaving, I never would

[Verse 2]
I was never satisfied with casual encounters
I can't hide my need
For two hearts that bleed
With burning love
That's the way it's got to be
Romeo and Juliet, they never felt this way I bet
So don't underestimate my point of view

[Chorus]
Cherish the thought
Of always having you here by my side
Oh baby, I cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life
I'm always singing it, cherish your strength
You got the power to make me feel good
And baby, I perish the thought
Of ever leaving, I never would

[Bridge]
Who? You! Can't get away, I won't let you
Who? You! I could never forget to
Cherish is the word I use to remind me of your love

[Interlude]
You're givin' it
You're givin' it to me boy
Keep giving me all-all-all your joy
Give me faith
I will always cherish you
Romeo and Juliet, they never felt this way I bet
So don't underestimate my point of view

[Bridge]
Who? You! Can't get away, I won't let you
Who? You! I could never forget to
Cherish is the word I use to remind me of your love

[Chorus]
Cherish the thought
Of always having you here by my side
Oh baby, I cherish the joy
You keep bringing it into my life
I'm always singing it, cherish your strength
You got the power to make me feel good
And baby, I perish the thought
Of ever leaving, I never would

[Interlude]
Cherish
Give me faith
Give me joy, my boy
I will always cherish you
Give me faith
Give me joy, my boy
I will always cherish you
Cherish your strength (You're givin' it, you're givin' it to me boy, keep giving me all your joy) Can't get away, I won't let you
Perish the thought (You're givin' it, you're givin' it to me boy, keep giving me all your joy) I could never forget to

[Outro]
Cherish the thought (Give me faith, give me joy)
(My boy I will always cherish you) (Can't get away, can't get away)
Cherish the joy (Give me faith, give me joy)
(My boy I will always cherish you) (Can't get away, can't get away)
Cherish your strength (You're givin' it)
(You're givin' it to me boy) (Can't get away, can't get away)
(Keep giving me all your joy)
Perish the thought (You're givin' it)
(You're givin' it to me boy) (Can't get away, can't get away)
(Keep giving me all your joy)
Cherish the thought (Give me faith, give me joy)
(My boy I will always cherish you) (Can't get away, can't get away)
Cherish the joy (Give me faith, give me joy)
(My boy I will always cherish you)

[Spoken Intro]
Come over here!

[Verse 1]
Some girls, they like candy
And others, they like to grind
I'll settle for the back of your hand
Somewhere on my behind
Treat me like I'm a bad girl
Even when I'm being good to you
I don't want you to thank me
You can just spank me
Ooh!

[Verse 2]
Some guys like to sweet talk
And others, they like to tease
Tie my hands behind my back and
Ooh, I'm in ecstasy
Don't slobber me with kisses
I can get that from my sisters
Before I get too cranky
You better

[Chorus]
Like hanky panky (Hanky panky)
Nothing like a good spanky (Good spanky)
Don't take out your handkerchiefs
I don't wanna cry
I just wanna hanky panky
Like hanky panky (Hanky panky)
Nothing like a good spanky (Good spanky)
Don't take out your handkerchiefs
I don't wanna cry
I just wanna hanky panky, guy
Oooh!

[Verse 3]
Please don't call a doctor
'Cause there's nothing wrong with me
I just like things a little rough
And you better not disagree
'Cause I don't like a big softie, no!
I like someone mean and bossy
Let me speak to you frankly
(Ooh, ooh) You better

[Chorus]
Like hanky panky (Hanky panky)
Nothing like a good spanky (Good spanky)
Don't take out your handkerchiefs
I don't wanna cry
I just wanna hanky panky
Like hanky panky (Hanky panky)
Nothing like a good spanky (Good spanky)
Don't take out your handkerchiefs
I don't wanna cry
I just wanna hanky panky, guy
Oooh, yeah

[Interlude]
What about?
Yeah!
That's an interesting...
Oooh!
My bottom hurts just thinking about it
(She wants you to) Treat me like I'm a bad girl
(She needs you to) Even when I'm being good to you
(Woo!) I don't want you to thank me (Don't thank her)
You better

[Chorus]
Like hanky panky (Hanky panky)
Nothing like a good spanky (Good spanky)
Don't take out your handkerchiefs
I don't wanna cry
I just wanna hanky panky
Like hanky panky (Hanky panky)
Nothing like a good spanky (Good spanky)
Don't take out your handkerchiefs
I don't wanna cry
I just wanna hanky panky, guy (Hanky panky)
Oooh, yeah (Good spanky)
Get the picture? (Wanna cry, I just wanna)

[Outro]
That's the way I came into this world (Hanky panky)
The doctor said, "Lady, she's a beautiful girl" (Good spanky)
He gave me a spanky and I started to smile (Wanna cry, I just wanna)
So give it up, honey, 'cause I want it
Yeah
(Hanky panky, good spanky)
(Wanna cry, I just wanna)
(Hanky panky, good spanky)

[Verse 1]
Don't tell me to stop
Tell the rain not to drop
Tell the wind not to blow
'Cause you said so, mmm
Tell the sun not to shine
Not to get up this time, no, no
Let it fall by the way
But don't leave me where I lay down

[Chorus]
Tell me love isn't true
It's just something that we do
Tell me everything I'm not
But please don't tell me to stop

[Verse 2]
Tell the leaves not to turn
But don't ever tell me I'll learn, no, no
Take the black off a crow
But don't tell me I have to go
Tell the bed not to lay
Like the open mouth of a grave, yeah
Not to stare up at me
Like a calf down on its knees

[Chorus]
Tell me love isn't true
It's just something that we do
Tell me everything I'm not
But don't ever tell me to stop
(Don't you ever) Tell me love isn't true
It's just something that we do
(Don't you ever) Tell me everything I'm not
But don't ever tell me to stop

[Outro]
(Don't you ever)
Please don't
Please don't
Please don't tell me to stop
(Don't you ever tell me) Don't you ever
Don't ever tell me to stop (Tell the rain not to drop)
Tell the bed not to lay
Like a open mouth of a grave, yeah
Not to stare up at me
Like a calf down on its knees
Tell the bed not to lay
Like a open mouth of a grave, yeah
Not to stare up at me
Like a calf down on its knees

[Verse 1]
Niggas don’t like when you fly as fuck
But I’m fly as fuck
When they see my face they be lighting up, up
They be lookin' til their hair gets stuck
When they comin' out their socks and such
Who’d do it how I do it hah? Nobody does
Can I have swag without being stopped for it?
I board 1st class, ye ain’t even lookin' at my boarding pass
'Til ya find out who I was
Now you want a photograph, a photograph
Haters on my back, like some shoulder pads
Nigga finna snap like a quarterback
Yea they know I’m fly but they hope I crash, hope I crash

[Hook]
If anybody else got something to say
Get in line, motherfucker
I swear to God I’m always on a hater’s mind
Don’t know why, I guess it’s
Cuz I’m a Fly muthafucka
I’m a Fly muthafucka
Fly muthafucka, Fly muthafucka
I swear I’m always on a hater’s mind
Don’t know why, I guess it’s
Cuz I’m a Fly muthafucka
I’m a Fly muthafucka
Fly muthafucka
Okay now watch me fly, mothafucka
I swear I’m always on a hater’s mind
Don’t know why, I guess it’s
Cuz I’m a Fly muthafucka
I’m a Fly muthafucka

[Verse 2]
Fly, fly, that nigga so fly
Y'all niggas so weak
Y'all niggas just blah
They don’t understand
Cuz you’re just so blind
I do this for the days
When I had just enough to get by
Now I got more than enough to get by
But I got more than enough on my mind
Just lost a loved one the other night
Just got home and another one died
I don’t even have the tears to cry
Tryna find gold in a diamond mine
Cuz diamonds are harder and harder to find
Ain’t no one left for me to call
Ain’t no more numbers on my line
Tell me how high must I climb
You fuck niggas stay on line
But I don’t really have the time
I don’t really have the time

[Hook] x2

I wanna do something a little different
Just to let y'all niggas know you can't fuck with me
Don't try this man, you are not me
Young Wiz

[Hook]
And if you fuck with me, grow

[Verse]
Used to just be a young'n spit-spittin' shit
Now I'm grown up in the game and get-gettin' it
Some of my old friends I can't kick it with
You a little slow, I'll show you what big business is
I be with those who own they own businesses
Blowin' big knots in spots where all the bitches is
I'm a star, don't talk to all the bitches-es
Give 'em time, they run to me like a finish line
Hatin' ass nigga actin' like a friend of mine
Get your day cut short like it's winter time
And I'm in the gr-grind 'til the end of time
The Young Beast, I'mma eat when it's dinner time
And my cig-cigarillo fill-filled with pine
Shit locked, but you still denyin'
That I'm the best that did, and the best that's do-doin' it
Prince of the city, I'm showin' and pro-provin' it
I'm on track, you cats are lo-losin' it
Go head, come at Wiz and look stupider
They said reach for the stars, I hit Jupiter
And now I'm workin' on my next galaxy
Never be another Young Khalifa after me
.25, you ain't even half of me
I work hard, dawg, no I don't relax a day
Could eat all y'all, but I don't like the aftertaste
What you niggas know about blowin' halfs of ray
In the lab gettin' 3 songs smashed a day
Got money up front, call it cash today
Got 3 bank accounts puttin' cash away
I do me to the fullest like Castaway
Throw a beat on and let a blunt ash away
I laugh today, and make y'all cry later
If the young boy reppin' the 'Burgh then why hate him
But I ain't worried cause my stacks gettin' bigger
If you ain't heard around, bitch I'm that ni-nigga
See me ridin' round window cracked, lit Swisher
Can't talk currency, I can't get wit ya
Who got it fucked up? Y'all convinced 'em
The hate in the equation just a small addition
My name Wiz Khalifa, but just call me mister...
4, 1, 2

[Hook]
And if you fuck with me, grow

My aunt asked my moms if she won the lotto, where would she choose to live in the world. my moms said los angeles..my aunt asked me next.. i said africa. I didn’t think about it a whole lot, it was just the first thing that came to mind. I’ve never been to africa but i know it’s a big place.. so my answer wasn’t really specific. It probably wasn’t even honest. I don’t know. I’m starting to think america’s fucked. I actually started thinking that a while ago. I sense a lot of young americans feel this way too, there’s good reason. honestly, i just live here. i’m an american, sure, but it’s not really a choice i made for myself. if you gave me a map i could show you worse places to be born and better. but i was born here, i live here and it’s chill here. so maybe if i hit the lotto, i’d stay in los angeles too.. pay the taxes and buy mom a house out here

Granted, i’ll probably revise this after i see the world. but what if i don’t?
my homie nabil flew out to somalia this past week to photograph and bring awareness to the famine unfolding out there.. a famine set to affect some 12 million people. there’s a few ways to donate money, but simply spreading the word is pretty helpful too. peace.

[Outro]
You didn't know I could do that, did you?

[Verse 1]
Forgiving him was the first thing I had to to
In order to move on
Forgetting it was not as easy to do
I had to teach myself to be strong
And it's so easy to be scared
When I think of all that I shared
When I think of how he made me feel
The bad and the good, sometimes I wish I could take it back
But we can't go back, gotta keep moving

[Pre-Chorus]
It's so good, don't wanna hear no woulda coulda
Maybe I shoulda stayed with someone who never knew that I was true
It's all good now that I'm going forward
Now that I'm growing, now that I'm knowing

[Chorus]
Never gonna give up on
Never gonna give up on love, oh-oh, oh-oh
Never gonna give up, give up on love, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I have to admit
You weren't the only one at fault
I was wrong too
Trying to be someone I knew that I wasn't
I thought I could make myself happy with you
And it's so easy to be scared
When I think of all that I shared
When I think of how he made me feel
The bad and the good
Sometimes I wish I could take it back
But we can't go back, gotta keep moving

[Pre-Chorus]
It's so good, don't wanna hear no woulda coulda
Maybe I shoulda stayed with someone who never knew that I was true
It's all good now that I'm going forward
Now that I'm growing, now that I'm knowing

[Chorus]
Never gonna give up on
Never gonna give up on love, oh-oh, oh-oh
Never gonna give up, give up on love, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Bridge]
I knew I was gonna get through it
Breaking up is hard to do, but I had to do it
Time has something to do with me figuring it out
What this is all about
When it came to me, when it comes to me
Gotta do what's best for me

[Pre-Chorus]
It's so good, don't wanna hear no woulda coulda
Maybe I shoulda stayed with someone who never knew that I was true
It's all good now that I'm going forward (Oh)
Now that I'm growing, now that I'm knowing

[Chorus]
Never gonna give up on
Never gonna give up on love, oh-oh
Never gonna give up, never gonna give up on love, oh-oh
(Never gonna give up, give up)

The whole go-go thing, DC, what's up? Haha
Virginia, y'all you know how we 'bout to do it
Ha, let's go, yessir

[Verse 1]
Been sitting here for an hour talking
But we ain't saying nothing
I ain't even tripping, mama, that's cool (That's cool)
No better way to waste time than with you
Ain't that a trip 'cause usually I do my thing and I dip, oh
But she got me wanna stick around for the second show
Have her do her thang on the stage for me once more

[Chorus]
And I'm like, oh
I can't wait for us to be alone, tell me
So tell me, tell me what you say, ma
We've been keeping it one hundred up to this far
So what you wanna do?
I'm tryna give it but I'm losing my cool for you
'Cause shorty got me thrown
Throwed off, lil' mama, she got me thrown, hey
Throwed off, lil' mama, she got me thrown, hey

[Verse 2]
Now I can't say all the things I wanna say
But that body is a problem for me
And I put shame on a man that walked away
But I'm glad he left you here for me, yeah
That's real 'cause usually I can't express how I feel, yeah
It's like I'm in my favorite scene on the movie screen
Diamond studded tee, crown holding my Spike Lee's

[Chorus]
And I'm like, woah-oh
I can't wait for us to be alone, tell me (Yeah, yeah)
So tell me, tell me what you say, ma (What you say?)
We've been keeping it one hundred up to this far (Oh, oh)
So what you wanna do?
I'm tryna give it but I'm losing my cool for you
(But you're taking it away, woah, woah)
'Cause shorty got me thrown
Throwed off, lil' mama, she got me thrown, hey (Yeah)
Throwed off, lil' mama, she got me thrown, hey (Ha, oh, hey!)

[Bridge]
Girl, you got that knock (Knock), I hear it down the block (Block)
And if I get a chance, guaranteed I keep it hot
I gotta get you locked (Ho!), so, baby, pick your feet up (Hey)
Adjust my two-seater, holla if you hear me now
Girl, you got that knock (Knock), I hear it down the block (Oh)
And if I get a chance, guaranteed I keep it hot (Oh, yeah)

Adjust my two-seater, holla if you hear me now

[Chorus]
And I'm like, oh (Oh)

So tell me, tell me what you say, ma
We've been keeping it one hundred up to this far (Yes, we have, baby)
So what you wanna do? (Do)
I'm tryna give it but I'm losing my cool for you (I'm losing my cool for you)
'Cause shorty got me thrown
Throwed off, lil' mama, she got me thrown, hey
Throwed off, lil' mama, she got me thrown, hey (Woah, woah, oh)

[Outro]
Yessir, haha, two up, two down
Holla at me, it's all about you
Ah, we out, let's go
Got me feeling like hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

[Intro: Chris Brown, Big Boi]
Hold on, this sounds like elevator music, haha
Chris Brown, Big Boi, yeah

[Verse 1: Big Boi, Chris Brown]
Hook, line and sinker, I knew she was mine the day I seen her (Hey)
Got a big mouth bass on the line, it's time for me to retrieve her (Hey, yeah)
And go get her like a wide receiver, but we don't play no ball
See when it comes to you, baby girl, B.B. don't play at all (Oh-oh, oh-oh)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
On the real we need to nip this in the bud (The bud)
'Cause we kept it real with everyone (Everyone)
So tell me why they hating (Everybody's hating)
It feels like they're just waiting for us to grow apart
Yeah, this is hard for me to do (Ooh, ooh)
But baby, if I'm your man, I guess I gotta be a man
These men just gotta understand
Little girl with curves and hips, luscious lips
Girl, I can't front now, I'm nervous

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
And I'm like hold up, wait, wait a minute
I'm genuine with it, I ain't tryna put no pimping in it
And I'm like hold up, can I talk to her?
Hold up, can I take her out?
Hold up, uh, that's why I gotta tell you

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Nowadays is so crazy out here, you'd wanna cut and leave
If your daughter struts with me, lucky me
And she'd be lucky too, no entourage, no crew
Just me riding with my boo
I got her, but don't think I'm replacing you
'Cause I know you know what I do and I'm a major minor
It'll take days and days and decades to find
Another dude that's gon' walk in my shoes
And go keep it one with you as long if you do the usual

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
And I'm talking 'bout hold up (Hold up), wait, wait a minute (Yeah)
I'm genuine with it, I ain't tryna put no pimping in it
And I'm like hold up, can I talk to her? (Girl)
Hold up, can I take her out? (Hey, yeah)
Hold up, uh, that's why I gotta tell you (Ha)

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Baby, please, hang up the phone 'cause I'm talking to your father
Mr Jones, Mr Jones, I've been talking to your daughter
And she like me, she told me she like me
And I really like her, she gon' be my wifey (If you take this off hold)
Baby, please, hang up the phone 'cause I'm talking to your father
Mr Jones, Mr Jones, I've been talking to your daughter
And she like me, she told me she like me
And I really like her, she gon' be my wifey (If you take this off hold)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
And I'm like hold up (Hold up), wait, wait a minute
I'm genuine with it, I ain't tryna put no pimping in it (Yeah)
And I'm like hold up (Hold up)
Hold up, hold up (You)
That's why I gotta tell you now

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Now is the time for me to come clean
Now is the time for us to turn that yellow light to green light and proceed
Us together, be more better like lemon pepper on your wings
And you'll never find another fellow that's better than your king
Know what I mean, know what I'm sayin'
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout, girl, who playin'?
But we can't have no picket fence 'cause we got acres and acres of land
The haters are takin' it mad that we can handle these fakers with class
Mannerisms on that C.O. five and a half on they *** (Haha)
Girl, bye, give it a try, give your boy a chance
Ever since you landed in my space it, seems like I was yours again
My top friend, drop them, we don't need no audience poppin'
For approval or applause, not them

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
And I'm like hold up, wait, wait a minute
I'm genuine with it, I ain't tryna put no pimping in it
And I'm like hold up, can I talk to her?
Hold up, can I take her out?
Hold up, uh, that's why I gotta tell you
And I'm like hold up, wait, wait a minute
I'm genuine with it, I ain't tryna put no pimping in it
And I'm like hold up, can I talk to her?
Hold up, can I take her out?
Hold up, uh, that's why I gotta tell you

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Baby, please
And she like me and I really like her
Baby, please
She gon' be my wifey
Baby, please

[Bridge]
Won't you help me 'cause I can't leave it alone? I can't stop it (Oh, oh, oh)
'Cause every time I get it alone, I gotta pop it (Oh, oh)
It's like that I be feeling too grown, I'm feining

When I get her alone, already know what I'm on it (Oh, oh, oh)
And I ain't tryna be good (Oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
Most don't get all of that brain and the face is so flawless (She's such a beautiful girl)
And every fantasy in my life I dream about is all in you
If I try would you take me where you are?
That place that many won't ever get a chance to see
You've been so cold (Cold, been so cold)
Maybe (Maybe), if you let me (Let me)
Your flame (Your flame) will be on again
Tell me what you want (Girl, tell me what you want)

Chris Brown

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
The meanest the meaner, the second I seen her
Had me open, got me looking, losing all my control
The passion I'm feining, baby, you're the new meaning
But I found myself tripping when you walked through the door
And I know it's not like me getting beside myself
She got me feeling that way
And I know it's unlikely that you're gon' deny me
And just walk away

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'll be that guy that don't have time to play
It's looking like a schedule is 'bout the same
The ball is in your court, I'm ready for your game
It's looking like your neck is ready for my chain
She be that girl I'll be waiting for
Sending me them signals that I can't ignore
Thought I was gonna get her on the dance floor
Then I saw her headed to the exit door

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I call her nice 'cause she got it
Do whatever whenever 'cause she 'bout it
That there's nice 'cause I got it
Do whatever, whenever 'cause I'm 'bout it
I'm falling for her
She got me trapped
That girl's nice 'cause she got it
'Cause she got it, she got it
Breathe, breathe

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Your body is screaming, believe that I'm listening
To every word you're saying, girl, I'm loosing my cool
You bet you a soldier and I got me a rider
And you ain't gotta stress it 'cause there's nothing to prove
I know it ain't easy being a sexy girl
That's always getting her way
But I'm here to tell you
You got me up on you and I won't let you slip away

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'll be that guy that don't have time to play (Nah)
It's looking like a schedule is 'bout the same (Yeah)
The ball is in your court, I'm ready for your game (Yeah)
It's looking like your neck is ready for my chain (Uh)
She be that girl I'll be waiting for
Sending me them signals that I can't ignore (Damn)
Thought I was gonna get her on the dance floor
Then I saw her headed to the exit door (Oh)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I call her nice 'cause she got it (Oh)
Do whatever whenever 'cause she 'bout it (Oh, yeah)
That there's nice 'cause I got it (I got it, yeah)
Do whatever, whenever 'cause I'm 'bout it ('Bout it)
I'm falling for her (Falling for her)
She got me trapped (Got me trapped)
That girl's nice 'cause she got it
'Cause she got it, she got it
Breathe, breathe

[Verse 3: The Game, Chris Brown]
Yeah, you ****** know now that it's 'bout go down
The club is packed up
The word around town that this is the jump off
You know when **** drops that this is the jump off
I did it for Big, Pac
I'm pourin' my Cristal, the ******* is too hot
They takin' they clothes off, they yellin' out, "2Pac"
'Cause I'm from the Westside and they from the East Coast
My ****** from down South, they lettin' they teeth show
'Cause this ain't Def Jam and this ain't Bad Boy
This ain't Star Trak, this is the last call
They turnin' the lights on, the bar is shot down
I'm walking with Scott Storch and we in the front now
The ******* is with me, they ready to pop off
You bringin' your girlfriend, she gotta get knocked off
So hop in the six-four 'cause this 'bout to get down
It's going down

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I call her nice 'cause she got it (Oh, ayy)
Do whatever whenever 'cause she 'bout it (She 'bout it)
That there's nice 'cause I got it (C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon)
Do whatever, whenever 'cause I'm 'bout it (C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon)
I'm falling for her
She got me trapped
That girl's nice 'cause she got it (Yeah)
'Cause she got it, she got it (Uh, uh)
Breathe (Uh, uh), breathe

Breathe (Uh, uh), breathe

[Intro]
Oh, woah
Yeah

[Verse 1]
It's a three-sixty turn, it's ending where we begin
Beginning like here's the end, like kissing and missing class
What we needed to learn was different than just some math
This the big picture, we missed it, the figures just didn't add up

[Pre-Chorus]
We said let's not leave on bad terms
In between them bad words (Oh), it could be love, right? Uh-huh (Uh-huh)
But are we gon' leave when it's this good? Damn, it was just 'cause
Seems this loving's all for nothing, baby, you know

[Chorus]
A heart ain't a brain
But I think that I still love you, still love you
A happy ending makes you cry
'Cause it ends when you don't want to, don't want to
And it makes perfect sense to end it like the start
How do I explain this nonsense to my heart?
A heart ain't a brain but I'm thinking that I still love you
Still love you, still love—

[Verse 2]
It's a plot twist, just when you said I got this
Right when the fight has stopped, it seemed right but it felt wrong
Held on, all them nights we held on, we can't let it go
But if we don't then we will never know

[Pre-Chorus]
We said let's not leave on bad terms
In between them bad words, it could be love, right? Uh-huh (Uh-huh, oh, oh)
But are we gon' leave when it's this good? Damn, it was just 'cause
Seems this loving's all for nothing, baby, you know

[Chorus]
A heart ain't a brain
But I think that I still love you, still love you
A happy ending makes you cry
'Cause it ends when you don't want to, don't want to, yeah
And it makes perfect sense to end it like the start
But how do I explain this nonsense to my heart? (Yeah)
A heart ain't a brain but I'm thinking that I still love you
Still love you, still love—

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh-oh (Ooh)
My heart is aching thinking 'bout all the love we wasted
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Oh, oh, oh)
My heart's impatient, can't understand the time we're taking
A heart can't have (Oh no), my heart can't decide (Can't decide, ooh)
But it's telling me it's right
And I know that we should just call it quits
But I'm thinking that all of this gotta change (Woah, woah)
'Cause my heart's going insane

[Chorus]
A heart ain't a brain
But I think that I still love you (Woah, my heart is going insane)
A happy ending makes you cry (And a happy ending)
'Cause it ends when you don't want to (Gonna make you cry, cry, cry, cry, oh)
And it makes perfect sense to end it like the start (Oh)
And how do I explain this nonsense to my heart?
A heart ain't a brain but I'm thinking that I still love you (Oh)
Still love you, still love you

[Outro]
Woah-ah, woah-woah-ah, woah
A heart ain't a brain but I think I love you (Ooh, ooh, ha)
Woah-ah, woah-woah-ah, woah
A heart ain't a brain but I think I love you (Ah)
Woah-ah, woah-woah-ah, woah (Oh)
A heart ain't a brain but I think I love you (Oh, woah)
Woah-ah, woah-woah-ah, woah
A heart ain't a brain but I think I love you (Ah)
Woah-ah, woah-woah-ah, woah
A heart ain't a brain but I think I love you

It's what I do, hey, it's what I do

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Everywhere I go they show me love so I give it back
Throw a couple stacks up in the air 'cause I'ma get it back (Oh)
See something sexy up in here, I'ma bring it back (Bring it back)
They keep on runnin' back (Runnin' back), they keep on comin' back (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
I was crazy when I said I didn't love you
From the first time that I ever saw you
The emotions running deep underneath my skin
Sign anywhere for your love, where do we begin?

[Pre-Chrous]
So lay me down
Tell me what I wanna hear
Take me down
There's nobody else I'd rather be with

[Chorus]
I wanna wake up in your arms
I wanna wake up in your arms
I wanna wake up in your arms
I wanna wake up in your arms

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, woah
Oh-oh-oh, woah
Oh-oh-oh, woah
Oh-oh-oh, woah

[Verse 2]
If my heart is outta place, move over
I could've told you how it hurts, could've told ya
And now I want you, I can feel it in my heartbeat
It's like a race, like I'm running in a track meet

[Pre-Chrous]
So lay me down (Oh-oh)
Tell me what I wanna hear (Oh-oh)
Take me down (Oh-oh)
There's nobody else I'd rather be with (Oh-oh)

Tu veux voler
Au bord du désir?

Mais est-ce que tu mérites mon amour?

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Half passed an hour in the club, I was tryna cut a rug
I was sippin' on, tryna find the missin' link
You had a mission tryna vouge
Then I came right through the smoke
I was smokin' hot, catch my fever, let's burn up the floor
I need to know, how to get into you
Baby, I'm likin' your bod'
Ooh, you got me stuck
I'm so effin' into you, I let you blow my moves

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Eva Simons, Both]
Don't breathe, I wanna take your breath
Let your body feel it all night

Let's start a riot on the floor
Do it 'til you pass out
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Do it 'til you pass out
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Do it 'til you pass out
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Do it 'til you pass out
Pass out, baby
Do it 'til you pass out

[Verse 2: Eva Simons]
I'm all amped up and it's so hard to turn me down
Let's burn shit up 'cause I'm your fire starter now
I'll bring it back, can you smell that?
Now that I'm a rock star, I just wanna stop your heart
Go, go (Go), dancer on the dance floor
Go, go (Go), am I what you asked for?
I'm a monster, not a pretty little girl
Eyes on me, so come follow me

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Eva Simons, Both]
Don't breathe, I wanna take your breath
Let your body feel it all night
I'm your battery here to charge you up
Let's start a riot on the floor

[Chorus]
Misty morning, don't see no sun
I know you are out there somewhere having fun
There is one mystery - yea-ea-eah - I just can't express
To give your more, to receive your less
One of my good friend said, in a reggae riddim
"Don't jump in the water, if you can't swim

[Verse 1]
The power of philosophy - yea-ea-eah - floats through my head
Light like a feather, heavy as lead
Light like a feather, heavy as lead, yeah

[Verse 2]
See no sun! Oh
Time has come, I want you
I want you to straighten out my tomorrow! Uh
I want - I want - I want you - (tomorrow)
Oh, wo-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
I want you to straighten out my (tomorrow)

[Chorus]

"You can't jump - you can't jump in the water, if you can't swim

[Verse 3]
I want you (I want you) - I want you to straighten out my today
My tomorrow - my-my-my - my - my
(I want you to straighten out my tomorrow)
On a misty morning! (I want you to straighten out my tomorrow)
The Boy and Dude 2 look at each other

A PHONE RINGS

The Boy picks up the phone

"HELLO, WHO'S THIS?"

The Boy puts down the phone

The Boy, sat in his room, removes his hooded sweatshirt and rolls over

MORNING:

KNOCKING ON THE WINDOW

Ends

[Hook: Dev]
Poppin bottles in the ice, like a blizzard
When we drink we do it right, gettin' slizzurred
Sippin sizzurp in my ride, like Three 6

Like a G6, Like a G6
Now I'm feelin so fly like a G6

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Hey, hey, hey

Champagne bottle after bottle, damn
Glass after glass til you feel a buzz
Baby bring it over, let me fill it up
I ain't did little shit since a little kid
I'm a big boy now so I do it big

Never mind why we do this ish

[Hook: Dev]

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
She ain't drunk, she acting like she drunk

She's a freak, I'm a freak
Funny how we just meet
Right here out on the floor
Give me more, give me more

[Bridge: The Cataracs]

But she ain't have her ringer nor her ring on last night, ooh

School me to the game, now I know my duty
Put her in the Lotus
She was ridin' in that hoopty (Whoop!)
Fuck that bitch, I got my own ho
Fuck your weed, I got my own smoke
Had to put my mink back on
Tell that bitch, put her ring back on

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Come on, come on, girl, why you frontin'?

[Verse 1]
I've hung around with the best out
Smile with my chest out
Shit, I've been stressed out, they thinkin' I'm depressed now
I just wanna go and chill at Kanye West's guest house
Bitch pull her breasts out, I forget about my ex now
Feelin' fresh out, chillin' in a penthouse
Been here for so long 'bout to start payin' rent now
She used to cook me breakfast 'til I turned her to a pen pal
I'm at the grocery store, lost in the eggs aisle
Ten-point takedown, Alabama shakedown
Used to rapid eye movement, beautifully awake now
Think I ain't a superhero, need to check my cape out

[Refrain]
Dripped up and draped out
It's all good, you safe now

[Chorus]
Be safe, homie
In this life or the next life, I'ma see ya
So, be safe, homie, be safe, homie
In this life or the next life, I'ma see ya

[Verse 2]
Yeah
And everything will be cooler
Maneuver away from evildoers
If Gene Hackman is captain, no one can beat the Hoosiers
See the future, no crystal ball that I'm starin' at
Ancient Egypt pharaoh rap starrin' Jack Kerouac
A half-a-ton of cattle dung, this shit I sadly have become
Ashin' blunts 'til I'm left with only half a lung (Half a lung)
Yeah, I'm here, self-proclaimed deity
Cryin' durin' the Lion King, that's just the G in me
Highly offensive, been on both sides of the fences
Hence the confusion when I stare at my reflection
Man's duality, life and its formalities
We're born as potential, then leave as a casualty
I'm in the lab, suited up, performing alchemy
Meditating 'til I'm levitating out my seat
It all started with a PayPal

[Refrain]
Dripped up, draped out
It's all good, you safe now

[Chorus]
Be safe, homie
In this life or the next life, I'ma see ya
So, be safe, homie, be safe, homie
In this life or the next life, I'ma see ya
I'm a prisoner
of words unsaid
Just lonely feelings
Locked away in my head
I trap myself further
Every time I stay, quiet
I should start to speak
But I stop and stay silent
And now I've made
My own hard bed
Inside this prison of words unsaid

P.O.W.
That's what I am
Not a prisoner of war
A prisoner of words
Mostly I say what you wanna hear
Could you take it if I came clear?
Or would you rather just see me
Stoned on a drug of complacency and compromise
M.I.A.
I guess that's what I am
Scraping this cold hard earth
For a piece of myself
For peace in myself
It'd be easier if you just put me in jail
You know, if you locked me away
I'd have someone to blame
But these bars of steel are of my making
They surround my mind
And have me shaking
My hands are cuffed behind my back
I'm a prisoner of the worst kind, in fact
A prisoner of compromise
A prisoner of compassion
A prisoner of kindness
A prisoner of expectation
A prisoner of my youth
Run too fast to be old
I've forgotten what I was told
Ain't I a sight to behold?

A prisoner of age dying to be young
To my head is my hand with a gun
And it's cold and it's hard
Cause there's nowhere to run
When you've caged yourself
By holding your tongue

I'm a prisoner
Of words unsaid
Just lonely feelings
Locked away in my head
It's like solitary confinement
Every time I stay quiet
I should start to speak
But I stop and stay silent
And now I've made
My own hard bed
Inside a prison of words unsaid

[Intro]
Young Chop on the beat
Uhh

[Chorus]
Where you going? What you doin'? (This type of shit)
They hating on it, but you keep it moving
Got money, then I got me some more (You could just spin it all the time)
Got money, then I got me some more

[Verse 1]
Hundred bottles that's nothin'
I be out Greystone and I'm stuntin'
I be up standing on the couch bottle in my mouth
Pourin' champaigne and spitting champaigne out
Just cause I came up from not havin' shit
Made a couple mill off this rapping shit
Smoking papers ya'll smoking backwoods
Hustle smart, while ya'll hustle backwards
Niggas gettin' lost in the game
Me, I'm all getting sorts of change
Niggas tryna cross in my lane
I'm thinking that it's awesome, fixing up a cone
Porsche getting washed in the rain
Rolex watches, diamonds in my chain, damn look at all them rings
Don't know what to call it, smoke like a rasta
Drink like an alcoholic, like I just came back from college
Take another shot I'm balling, KK cones up in my wallet
Came here and turnt up, Now your hoes wanna' go with us
At the crib with my niggas
They ain't acting like they your bitches no more

[Chorus]
Where you going? What you doin'?
They hating on it, but you keep it moving
Got money, then I got me some more
Got money, then I got me some more

[Post-Chorus]
Keep that KK, and it's rolled up
Got that bombay, now we slowed up
Got money, then I got me some more
Got money, then I got me some more

[Verse 2]
When I started this ain't have all of this
Now I came up what chu' calling it?
Couple millionaires on my calling list
Need it Hookah's niggas yes men
Scared to tell the truth cause
Now these old heads think they the new us
Got a bitch so thick call her two cups
And my chain so cold got the roof up
I only been here for three years and made more than you in ten
Told my niggas we started broke and never going there again (thank god amen)
Them niggas hating but they know we don't stop
Now I'm flying out to different places
Talking shit
Demonstrating shit that makes us rich and famous
Money conversations
Obligations, not about a dollar is a foreign language
Now I got everything
A better car, a better team and I ain't worried about nigggaaaasss

[Chorus]
Where you going? What you doin'?
They hating on it, but you keep it moving
Got money, then I got me some more
Got money, then I got me some more

[Post-Chorus]
Keep that KK, and it's rolled up
Got that bombay, now we slowed up
Got money, then I got me some more
Got money, then I got me some more

[Bridge]
Got money, then I got me
If it's 'bout money, it's 'bout me
Made my way up in the game
When they doubted me, oh
Got money, then I got me some more
Got money, then I got me some more
Got money, then I got me
If it's bout money, it's bout me
If you rolling up, ain't no getting high
Without me, no
Got money, then I got me some more (Oh)
Got money, then I got me some more (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
Where you going? What you doin'?
They hating on it, but you keep it moving
Got money, then I got me some more
Got money, then I got me some more

[Post-Chorus]
Keep that KK, and it's rolled up
Got that bombay, now we slowed up
Got money, then I got me some more
Got money, then I got me some more

[Intro]
Yeah
*Gunshot, woman screaming*

[Verse 1]
I didn't mean to pull the trigger, I swear
But now she’s dead and there ain't no comin' back once you there
I hope she knew that I loved her, I hope she knew that I cared
Your food gettin' cold, why don’t you come sit down in this chair?
We can talk about all the things we should have done
All the arguments that you probably would have won
But I'm stubborn, baby, you knew that
When you told me you loved me and I told you I loved you back
But now you layin' on the tile, I’m waitin' for a smile
So I’ll stay here for a while

[Refrain]
When the cops come in, they're gonna have to take me away

[Chorus]
And I tell 'em, "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do it"
I guess I'm just emotional and maybe kinda stupid
I just wanna hold you close, so why'd I have to give you away?
*Gunshot, woman screaming*
I tell 'em, "I'm sorry, I'm not a bad person"
I couldn't take your pain away, I guess I'm undeservin'
But if I can't have you to myself, then you're gone
*Gunshot*

[Verse 2]
I didn't mean to pull the trigger, I swear
Life full of surprises, but that shit isn't fair
Tell me how we live is different, guess this shit kinda rare
Your food gettin' cold, why don't you come sit down in this chair?
We can talk about everything you hate on this earth
And that you're gettin' tired, 'cause you makin' it work
But can I kiss you just one more time?
Baby, lemme close your eyes, feel your lips touchin' mine
I'm sure I've never seen you look more heavenly
Now I'm rubbin' on your back, whisperin', "Rest in peace"
It's okay, baby, go to sleep
I'll keep you safe, you alone with me
Say I wouldn't hurt you, I lied
I don't deserve you, I tried
So I'ma stay by your side

[Refrain]
But when the cops come in, they're gonna have to take me away

[Chorus]
And I tell 'em, "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do it"
I guess I'm just emotional and maybe kinda stupid
I just wanna hold you close, so why'd I have to give you away?
*Gunshot, woman screaming*
I tell 'em, "I'm sorry, I'm not a bad person"
I couldn't take your pain away, I guess I'm undeservin'
But if I can't have you to myself, then you're gone
*Gunshot*

[Chorus]
Tell me what reality is, all of y'all back on my dick
Woah, woah
I don't get mad about shit, but did you see that ass on that bitch?
Woah, woah
No, I'm not waitin' in line, you got a little paper? That's fine
Woah, woah
Find it hard to make up my mind, all of y'all hate when I shine
Woah, woah

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh
(Ladies and gentlemen
This is a revolution)
Ooh

[Verse 1]
On that black bush, smoke a bunch of Backwoods
My mind numb, I'm high as high come
I'm somewhat of a fuck up, put it in her guts 'til the cum bust
Combustion, at the function, drunk and actin' as prophets would
When Pac rocked with Suge, smokin' blunts at Hollywood
I was a youngin who didn't know shit 'bout nothin'
But now I'm twenty-one and I feel like I'm onto somethin'
Gettin' emphysema, madder than Ebenezer
I'm a king, bitch (Salads, I get a Caesar)
Pullin' uranium from Mesopotamian rivers
I need a bitch that let me fuck then make me some dinner
God made me a sinner, followin' protocol
Overall, I'm fuckin' bitches and there's coke involved
Watchin' Carl Sagan, wishin' I could talk Jamaican
I'm waitin', be prepared for invasion

[Chorus]
Tell me what reality is, all of y'all back on my dick
Woah, woah
I don't get mad about shit, but did you see that ass on that bitch?
Woah, woah (Woo)
No, I'm not waitin' in line, you got a little paper? That's fine
Woah, woah
Find it hard to make up my mind, all of y'all hate when I shine
Woah, woah

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh
Ooh

[Verse 2]
I blow a kiss to the Jehovah’s Witness
Fuck a corporation, I support local business (That's the right thing to do)
And this one goes out to all the hoes and bitches
My homies told me, "Better know your limits" (Know your limits)
I'm so efficient, old tradition with dope prevision (Woah)
We smokin' if we here, homie, don't need no permission
Variation of avian in the atrium
Waitin' for nature's rain to shower y'all with some sense
Shit, life gets realer than the press kits
Special like Ed is, so someone call the medic
'Cause I lost my mind, I'm off the Richter scale (Richter scale)
Don't you worry yourself, baby, this is hell (Woo)
Product of a witches spell, rappers all Chippendale
I'm gettin'-gettin' money now, expensive ginger ale (Taste good)
Sip the whiskey with a bitch named Lewinsky (Haha)
Told her give me head and tell everybody (Tell everybody, let 'em know)

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Um, she say she love me for these cold-ass raps
Wanna be involved but no strings attached
Listen, honey, I'm feelin' kinda hungry
Go to dinner with ya girls, can you bring somethin' back?
It's unusual that I would feel so strong
The party upstairs, you waitin' in the lobby
Fuck cares, valet the Ferrari
Bright Vegas lights get alarming, I'm sorry
Too drunk for sex, I might pass out early
Just keep it wet and I'll hit it in the morning
Glory, free-fallin' forty-three stories, cordially sippin' forties
Hooked up to morphine, for sure clean like bald heads
I kinda wish that we would fuck more and talk less
Except me and you a little far-fetched
Reach for the stars, got my arms stretched, God bless

[Chorus: Syd & Thundercat]
I can be there tonight, but don't be mad if I'm late
I'm just caught at the light
Hope you'll be there in the morning
I can be there tonight, but don't be mad if I'm late
Just hop off for the night
Know I'll be there in the morning

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
And I, I need a cool bitch, conversation skills
Roll blunts and in love with Darth Vader films
Love to sit there and chill when I play the keys
When it turn to fall, she love to go and rake the leaves
Make-believe, used to dream of bein' Ann Marie
Or a model for Maybelline
But fantasies tend to die off when you grow up quickly
Her walls the exact same color as a Tiffany box
Make her waffles, solvin' riddles on her Popsicle stick
If she could, she would leave in a rocket ship
The way she feel got her nervous like a doctor's trip
Mom said she should see a psychologist
Say she love me for my cold-ass raps
Never tell me where the cocaine stashed
She up late worried, tell me, "Hurry up home"
Eleven missed calls on my phone, woah

[Chorus: Syd & Thundercat]
I can be there tonight, but don't be mad if I'm late
I'm just caught at the light
Hope you'll be there in the morning
I can be there tonight, but don't be mad if I'm late
Just hop off for the night
Know I'll be there in the morning

[Instrumental: Thundercat]

[Verse 1]
Man I got stacks of money in my living room
Bitches all with they titties out
Niggas watching my backyard cause that black car can buy Diddy's house
Act hard and I'm kicking out, that 9 stay sticking out
T-Pain looking bad, that don't exist like Hello Kitty's Mouth
Pop the trunk and I'll pack it up
Chevrolet with a few teeth missing
Hit the spot, then I'll back it up
Abracadabra! Them keys shipping
And I'm like give us free, give us free
I'm a boss getting head from 2 hoes unless I hit up 3
I be putting in work

[Hook]
Man I be putting in work
People say my house look like a factory
Federales coming after me
They ain't gonna capture me
Man, I be putting in work
And all these bitches adore me
So, if they looking for me
Tell them mothafuckas I be putting in work
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work
So if they looking for me
Tell them mothafuckas I be putting in work

[Verse 2]
Now it's imperative, that I take care of this
I snatch yo bitch up out of that tub, man, like Harriet
I know they scared of this, cause ain't no nigga better than what I got on my team
I done got hella rich, I went back to the dreads again
I had to go and get clean
I done surrounded myself with drug dealers
And niggas that just got out
And I don't hang with no fuck niggas
Everybody 'round me got clout
And we hollerin' bout, give us free, give us free
I'm a boss getting head from two hoes unless I hit up 3
I be putting in work

[Hook]
Man I be putting in work
People say my house look like a factory
Federales coming after me
They ain't gonna capture me man I be putting in work
And all these bitches adore me
So if they looking for me
Tell them mothafuckas I be putting in work
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work
So if they looking for me
Tell them mothafuckas I be putting in work

[Verse 3]
10 million won't hurt me, I'm set for life in this shit, nigga
None of y'all niggas gone murk me, I spend a night with your bitch
Than Ima have to end the night, straight licking
Imma spend it right when I get it
Keep my enemies tight, but no slipping
They be feeling the hype when I'm in it
Man, the rhythm be nice when I'm spitting, shitting on them
That shit don't phase me, every last song I drop, hitting on them
Got a basement full of hoes, and me and my wife feeling on them
And they be kissing on me, all like give us free
I'm a boss getting head from two hoes unless I hit up 3
I be putting in work

[Hook]
Man I be putting in work

[Hook: B.o.B]
I guess I bit off more than I could chew
And nobody told me, nobody told me
Had it all and never knew
Cuz nobody told me

[Chorus: B.o.B]
Nobody told me money don't make you rich
And if it did, I'm missing something
Nobody told me you can lose when you win
And if they did, I'd still be missing

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Who knew that this much success will make it so hard
For fans to accept the fact that I can't go back where I left
And back track my steps, back track my steps
The records I dropped, so massive, so large
It makes it hard for hip-hop to digest
The things that I do, I guess if it's true
Well fuck it, a nigga too good to be the best
Too good to be the best, too good to be stressed
Cuz this the type of life, too good to regret
You know money don't buy you no respect
Nigga no respect, nigga no respect yea
So what the hell is that?
I'm tryna recreate the past that I never had
And smash girls I could never smash
And live fantasies that'll never last

[Hook & Chorus: B.o.B]

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
I ran away from home just to try to make a million
Yea, just to try to make a million
And when you get a million it's a different type of feeling
When you look around and what you really need is missing
It's like, it's like I'm suffering from a sickness
And can't find a doctor to fill out the prescription
Or diagnose the illness
Can't leave it in the book, can't buy from the dealer
And I find that ironic
Yeah, I find that ironic
How I can buy anything that I ever wanted
But I really had it all when I ain't have nothing
They always say that mo money, mo problems
I guess I, I guess I should've listened to the warning
I guess I, I guess I should anticipate the stormy weather
I guess I'd illustrate it if it's good but however
Well if it's clever
I couldn't find the words to say it better
I'm knee-deep within these endeavors
But all that glitters with gold is not treasure
I'm ready for whatever, I never let er
I work even better when I'm under pressure
They say money don't make you rich
Cuz you can't buy shit that can make you better, word

[Hook  & Chorus: B.o.B]

[Intro: 2Pac]
I shine and no one else shines, I think everybody shines in different things
I know how to go to that true spot in myself because I'm there everyday
I can be me, I can be whoever because I'm true to me
I can go to neutral easy, a lot of people black, white, mexican, young, old, fat or skinny
Have a problem being true to themselves

[Hook]
Dolla Bill and Tyga man, I call that comradery
Dolla Bill and Tyga man, I call that comradery
Dolla Bill and Tyga man, I call that comradery
Dolla Bill and Tyga man
Dolla Bill rest in peace

Dolla Bill and Tyga man, I call that comradery
Dolla Bill and Tyga man, I call that comradery
Dolla Bill and Tyga man, I call that comradery
Dolla Bill and Tyga man
Dolla Bill rest in peace (rest in peace)

[Verse 1]
Reportin live from a good soul who knew a Roderick
I met Dolla, spirited piece I know you're watchin'
Carried his coffin, dearly departed young artist
Who said it loudly, losing was never a damn option
First met my nigga we was up in Arizona
Told him I got some bitches for you up in California
Never knew May 18th you'd be in California
I swear to God, God go get them niggas homie
Cases only, if they hit and we make bail, we may bail
Then landed up in ATL, club dream 

[?]
She was like "what's that mean?" (what's that mean?)
Something like a secret society
And I was up the street, I wish you would've called me
Shoutout for T money, the gang ENT
Sending my condolences from Young money GED

[Outro]
Dolla Bill and Tyga man, I call that comradery
Dolla Bill and Tyga man, I call that comradery
Dolla Bill and Tyga man, I call that comradery
Dolla Bill and Tyga man
Dolla Bill rest in peace 

[x3]

[Intro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
When I sleep  I have dreams about the way we used to kiss
'Bout the way you used to hold me
And say nothing would ever harm me
When we first met, oh, how you charmed me
Made me smile when I was down
Big pimping around the town, you and me
Whenever they'd see you, they'd see me
A lover and a friend to me you were, how did it end?
How it hurts to not have you in my life
When I wanted to be your wife

[Pre-Chorus]
You never know what you have 'til it's gone
Treated you wrong for so long
Now you're gone away
But the love still lives here

[Chorus]
Still, I still got love for you
Still, after all we've been through
Still, I gave my heart to you
And baby, you're the only one (The only one)
There's other men than you
Still, they can come close to you
Still, once I said, "I love you"
I knew you'd be the only one

[Verse 2]
A good man you were to me, always there to care
Would do anything in this world for me (Oh, oh)
Didn't matter, what, when, or where, you were there
I never thought we'd part from the arguments we'd start
When I just wanted to get some attention (Sorry)
And I'm sorry, baby for bitching
If I could take back the words
That I said to make you leave
I'd be down on bended knees
Asking you to please forgive me

[Pre-Chorus]
You never know what you have 'til it's gone
Treated you wrong for so long
Now you're gone away
But the love still lives here

[Chorus]
Still, I still got love for you
Still, after all we've been through
Still, I gave my heart to you
And baby, you're the only one (The only one)
There's other men than you
Still, they can come close to you
Still, once I said, "I love you"
I knew you'd be the only one

[Bridge]
All of the good times we had together (Together)
Do they mean something to you?
Do you ever wish we never split?
'Cause I still got love for you

[Chorus]
Still, I still got love for you
Still, after all we've been through
Still, I gave my heart to you (Gave my heart to you)
And baby, you're the only one
There's other men than you (There's other men than you)
Still, they can come close to you
Still, once I said, "I love you"
I knew you'd be the only one
Still, I still got love for you (Still got love)
Still, after all we've been through
Still, I gave my heart to you
And baby, you're the only one
There's other men than you
Still, they can come close to you (I love you)
Still, once I said, "I love you"
I knew you'd be the only one

"This is the Rocket Powered Space Capsule. All systems are go."
And the story goes, a young man will come
And save the universe from the forces of evil

[Verse 1]
Take a second to adjust to the ride
They say if this was a crime, it'd be federal
Lately I've been feelin' invincible
As I'm tryna find my way, can't nothing hold me though
I say, get a clue, the vibes all around you
Try but you can't deny when it's in your soul
Let's take it where there aren't any roads
Where these sucka hatin' niggas can't follow, baby

[Chorus]
Take it to the satellite, tonight
Take flight to the moon
Come get in my space whip to the satellite, tonight
Take flight to the moon
Take a ride
No worries, no worries, no worries, no worries

[Verse 2]
Come on don't be shy, let your guard down and work it
Do just what you want, anything you choose
I tell ya, there's no way we could lose
Have you ever seen the Earth from this view? I bet not

[Chorus]
Take it to the satellite, tonight
Take flight to the moon
Come get in my space whip to the satellite, tonight
Take flight to the moon
Take a ride, take a ride, take a ride, take a ride
And now, the vibes

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Heavy little thoughts get jumbled in a bundle
And they're tucked deep down in the back of my brain
Heavy little thoughts get jumbled in a bundle
And they're tucked deep down in the back of my brain
Heavy little thoughts get jumbled in a bundle
And they're tucked deep down in the back of my brain
All is life and all is pain
Down the hallway of my endless fate

[Chorus]
Take it to the satellite, tonight
Take flight to the moon
Come get in my space whip to the satellite, tonight
Take flight to the moon
Take a ride, take a ride
Come on, yea
Take it to the satellite, tonight
Take flight to the moon
Come get in my space whip to the satellite, tonight
Take flight to the moon
Take a ride, take a ride
Come on, yea

[Outro]
Come on, dream on
Come on, come on
Dream on, no worries

[Hook 1: B.o.B]
Nothing is forever is it?
Nothing is forever is it?
Nothing is forever is it?
So until I die, I’ll be forever livin'

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Started with my pockets slim
Now I got a lot of 'M's
They see me and they know it’s him
Oh they oh they know it’s him
I’m so high, I don’t even get high no more
I’m so fly, I don’t even look down no more
I’m so out there, I'm not going out no more
Niggas still hate, I don’t even know why no more

[Bridge: B.o.B]
I don’t know why, I don’t know why
These niggas lame and I don’t know why
I don’t know why, I don’t know why
We ain’t the same and I don’t know why

[Hook 1]

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Motherfuck your opinion
I'll show you where you can stick it
I swear they worse than these bitches, all these niggas got feelings
They say I got too many women but I’m just keepin it pimpin
The way she mastered that P, I guess she keep it No Limit
Now watch me get ignorant, roof with no ceiling, smoking on "Hilary"
Me, I’m so different, I just stand out, these niggas be blending in
They say I’m too "pop," they say I’m too "hood"
Now that’s a predicament
But as you can see: The path that I’m on, success is just imminent
But at least I know I’m on alert
And I know I know I've got my worth
You see there's snakes out there and they sure are lurkin'
Because this life ain’t fair and it sure ain’t perfect

[Bridge]

[Hook 2: B.o.B]
Nothing is forever is it?
It sure as fuck ain't television
Nothing is forever is it?
So until I die, I'll be forever livin'

[Verse 3: Playboy Tre]
Yeah, everybody's talking like they're so cold
But when this shit jumps off, they ain’t tough no more
All my white friends are like: "You soft bro!"
And all my black friends, you know them
They be like: "Fuck them lying-ass hoes!"
Nothing lasts forever, so why are they hating?
I don’t have a clue, nigga's wanna brag about money?
Guess what nigga: We've got money too
Treboy, Playboy, you can call me Christian's dad
And if you freak wanna try to jump down
I'mma leap off of that lilly pad

[Chorus]
If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me and call me "baby"?

[Verse 1]
Now, if I give you me, this is how it's got to be
First of all, I won't take you cheatin' on me
Tell me, who can I trust if I can't trust in you?
And I refuse to let you play me for a fool (Yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
You said that we could possibly spend eternity
(You said that we could possibly spend eternity, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want you trying to get with me (Don't want you)
(Don't want you trying to get with me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I end up unhappy

So before I do give myself to you

I have to know the truth
If I spend my life with you

[Chorus]
If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust (Had my love, gave you trust)
Would you comfort me? What would you do, babe? Tell me right now
And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue (I need to know, be untrue)
Would you lie to me and call me "baby"? (Don't lie, don't you lie to me)
If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust (if I gave it to you)
What would you do? Would you comfort me? (Comfort me, ooh, tell me, baby)

Would you lie to me and call me "baby"?

[Intro]
Say, ha
Yeah, woo! Woo!

[Verse 1]
Through the bumpy roads, the others bite the dust
'Cause they be thinking they're in love when their in lust
But cliché breaking up so easy
I'm about to throw a curve ball, honey
People let the stormy weather push them out
But back against the road it's easy to be over
Don't sweat the little things, wake up
Stay together, it's a new break up

[Pre-Chorus]
Everyday, I think how we done it
Every way that we can keep loving
Toe-to-toe, we so strong
And on and on, we up and running
Not a day goes by without dreaming
Not a thing goes out, just keep reaching
Through the storm, we stay warm
And on and on, we keep on loving

[Chorus]
The stars are in our favor (Yeah)
This time comes second nature (Oh)
Heartbreaks are overrated
Stay together, that's the new trend
Boy, we done started something serious (Serious)
'Cause romance is underrated (Oh, yeah)
Stay together, that's the new trend

[Verse 2]
Through the bumpy roads, the others bite the dust
And seems like everybody's giving up when
These days, breaking up's so cliché
Hear them screaming out, "Baby, no, please stay"
People always wanna always hurry up and wait for
Someone better than the person they won't stay for
They sweat the little things, wake up
Stay together, it's the new breakup

[Pre-Chorus]
Everyday, I think how we done it
Every way that we can keep loving
Toe-to-toe, we so strong
And on and on, we up and running (Yeah, yeah)
Not a day goes by without dreaming
Not a thing goes out, just keep reaching
Through the storm, we stay warm
And on and on, we keep on loving (Yeah)

[Chorus]
The stars are in our favor
This time comes second nature (Second nature)
Heartbreaks are overrated
Stay together, that's the new trend
Boy, we done started something serious (Serious)
'Cause romance is underrated
Stay together, that's the new trend
Hey, yeah

[Bridge]
And though there'll be the nights of fights and we must face it
It's like a roller coaster, ups and downs will come
As long as we hold tight and never act complacent
Remember how we built this, then our love is never done

[Pre-Chorus]
Everyday, I think how we done it
Every way that we can keep loving (Keep loving)
Toe-to-toe, we so strong
And on and on, we up and running
Not a day goes by without dreaming (Yeah)
Not a thing goes out, just keep reaching
Through the storm, we stay warm
And on and on, we keep on loving

[Chorus]
The stars are in our favor
This time comes second nature (Ooh)
Heartbreaks are overrated (Overrated)
Stay together, that's the new trend
Boy, we done started something serious (Oh)
'Cause romance is underrated (Ooh)
Stay together, that's the new trend

[Outro]
Hey, ha
Ooh, uh
Ooh

[Intro]
Step into my world
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Woah-oh-oh
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Woah-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Like a moth to a flame, you know you're drawn to me
I know you better than you know yourself, baby
Why do you try to resist what you want, honey?
I want you to give me what I need, listen closely

[Pre-Chorus]
I need you to hold on me
I need you to kiss on me
Feel your body next to me
I want you to, I need you to
Want you to give into me
Want all of you, everything
Ecstasy is what I will bring you if you just

[Chorus]
Step into my world
Where there's countless things to see
Endless possibilities
Let me take you to a place where desires flow deep
See an odyssey of dreams and the best of fantasies
All this for your eyes only, ooh, step into my world

[Verse 2]
Close your eyes and let your feelings now take over
It's alright, I'm intoxicating you though you're sober
You inside, the thought alone is so overbearing
Boy, tonight you just follow my lead from here and

[Pre-Chorus]
I need you to hold on me
I need you to kiss on me
Feel your body next to me
I want you to, I need you to
Want you to give into me
Want all of you, everything
Ecstasy is what I will bring you if you just

[Chorus]
Step into my world
Where there's countless things to see
Endless possibilities
Let me take you to a place where desires flow deep
See an odyssey of dreams and the best of fantasies
All this for your eyes only, ooh, step into my world

[Bridge]
Where there's no reality
Time itself means nothing
It's so hypnotizing
It brings you to a state of natural high
See how my words, they get to you?
Creates the lift that's haunting you
Yes, that's it, hold onto it
Ooh, welcome to my world

[Interlude]
My world
Where desires flow deep
Fantasies

[Chorus]
Ooh, step into my world
Where there's countless things to see
Endless possibilities (Oh-oh-oh)
Let me take you to a place where desires flow deep
See an odyssey of dreams (Odyssey of dreams) and the best of fantasies
All this for your eyes only, ooh, step into my world

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Woah-oh-oh
Oh, oh
Woah-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Would you mind if I took the time to get to know you?
'Cause it's been a while since all we've been through
And even though I said my feelings wouldn't change
Nothing stays the same, ooh
I could see when I look in your eyes, you mean no harm
It's just the way you manipulate me with your charm
And I can tell the love I have for you still strong
And there ain't nothing wrong with me still loving you

[Chorus]
After all that we've been through (Ooh)
I find myself still loving you (Yeah)
But I think we need to take the time to get back
'Cause I never get up on a good thing
I never give up on the love we had (Ooh, ooh)
We just need to take it slow

[Verse 2]
In the past, you would act as if you don't really care
You would fight and argue almost anywhere
Looking back sometimes, I feel like such a fool
For putting up with you, boo
Baby, please understand me if it seems I'm confused
It's just it might take me some time to get used to you
When I think of all the things we used to do, baby
I just find myself still loving you

[Chorus]
After all that we've been through (Yeah)
I find myself still loving you (Oh)
But I think we need to take the time to get back (No, no)
'Cause I never get up on a good thing
I never give up on the love we had (Baby)
We just need to take it slow

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I believe you and me have a chance to make this right
Oh, baby, if your heart is in it, I'm still with it
Even after all this time has passed
Oh, I'm still loving you

[Chorus]
After all that we've been through (Yeah)
I find myself still loving you (Oh, woah, yeah)
But I think we need to take the time to get back
'Cause I never get up on a good thing
I never give up on the love we had (Baby)
We just need to take it slow
After all that we've been through (Oh-oh)
I find myself still loving you (Baby)
But I think we need to take the time to get back
'Cause I never get up on a good thing (Never give up)
I never give up on the love we had (Love we had)
We just need to take it slow

Now you've been holding me down, mmm
For such a long time now
From back then 'til now, in my story
Straight from the hood, you've always been there for me

Back when everybody said I wasn't anything
It was you who kept me holding on, no matter what was going on
So whatever you need, I got you, yeah (Yeah, uh, yeah)

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Reminiscin' that 6 train from way back
Now it's sky blue Phantoms and stretch Maybachs
From sweepin' them floors in them Bronx apartments, ha

Whatever you need, I'll be there for you

[Verse 5: Fat Joe]
Like green is to autumn, some things must stay
This industry, yeah, I fought 'em, made me this way
Get between me and J. Lo, I simply state
You're better off sweepin' leaves on a windy day, no

[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez]
So I don't care about the situation
I'ma ride for you if there's a complication
'Cause every time you had my back and all
When we were young, now you Joey Crack and all

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Now my loyalty will always be (Now my loyalty will always be)

[Verse 1]
Pulled up at the red light
Cutie popped up on my left side
Window down, waiting for my reply
Not a word, I saw it in his eyes
Tell me something good, baby
He said, "Whatever you want to do" (For real? Uh)
He pulled to the curb, houses flash by (Woo!)
I got out with the catwalk shy (Catwalk shy)
Short skirt, golden brown thighs
Gucci heels, four inch high
He touched my face
Smiled and said, "Whatever you want to do" (Catch ya)

[Chorus]
Now I, said I usually need some time to get inside
So I don't know why you and me feel so right
Maybe we need tonight
Whatever you want

[Verse 2]
We sipping, music all loud
Conversation, your lollypop mouth
You open up, sweet things come out
Whisper to me, what you talking about?
I said, "I think you know"
He said, "Whatever you want to do" (Woo!)
You stand up, taking my breath (Taking my breath)
It's your song so you do it two steps (Do it two steps)
I turned away, moved my hips slow (Move so slow)
Your thoughts, fully exposed
Now we better stop playing
I said, "Boy, whatcha gonna do?" (Hey)

[Chorus]
Now I, oh I, usually take my time to get inside
So I don't know why you and me feel so right
You and I need tonight

[Intro]
I love
Boy, I love you so
I love

[Verse 1]
You and I have been around each other for quite a while
But I don't think that you understand the way that I feel for you
Baby, it took a while for me, yeah, yeah, to realize that you were so naive
Well maybe you were blind and cannot see
The feelings I have for you, you don't understand
The things that I've gone through
To paint a perfect picture just for you (Picture for you)
I've even told your friends, but that won't do
Well, baby, you have to know, I can't wait no more

[Chorus]
(I) Love you more than you will ever know
(Love) I've been trying so hard to show you
(I) Love you like a queen would love her king
(Love) Baby, I've been trying to show you

[Verse 2]
Look at me, try to understand that I am here for you
And whatever you are going through no matter what you ask me to do I will do
See baby, I'm trying to make you see (Tryna make you see)
This is not pretend or make believe (Make believe)
I want to be the woman that you need
Just let me get close to you, take me in your heart
Every day I want you more and more (Want you more and more)
Never in my life was I so sure (Oh-oh-oh)
These feelings I have I can't ignore
So baby, just let me know, all I'm trying to say is

[Chorus]
(I) Love you more than I can love myself
(Love) I would die before I hurt you
(I) Love you like a woman loves a man
(Love) When there's no one else to live for

[Bridge]
Baby, for so long
I've always tried to show you just how much I care for you
Boy, you had to know that I could never let you go
I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you understand that

[Chorus]
(I) Love you when there's no more love to give
(Love) Baby, I will always want you
(I) Love you when you're up against it all
(Love) I'l be by your side forever

[Outro]
(I) I love you, baby, love you, baby
(Love) Love you, baby, love you, baby
(I) Love you, baby, love you, baby
(Love) I love you, baby, love you, baby
(You)

[Intro]
What? What? What? Hey
Yeah, you

[Verse 1]
You had a dark, sexy vibe about you
And in a strange way you turn me on
The way you look said a lot about you
As if you really didn't give a uh
I told myself not to fall for you
Because I can see that you don't follow rules
I should have just walked away
But your eyes were telling me to stay

[Refrain]
Damn, why do the wild ones turn me on?

[Chorus]
It is like cherry pie, you can't deny it
Driving fast, you had to try it
That's what it feels like
Letting Tony touch you everywhere
Breaking rules and didn't care
That's what it feels like

[Verse 2]
A real rebel kind of fellow
The kind that I would never trust
I could read what your mind was thinking
It's like you still didn't give a hey
It's funny how those kind of guys
Have a way of getting what they want
And even good girls, though they try
You see, they just can't seem to stay away

[Refrain]
Damn, why do the wild ones turn me on?

[Chorus]
It is like cherry pie, you can't deny it
Driving fast, you had to try it
That's what it feels like
Letting Tony touch you everywhere
Breaking rules and didn't care
That's what it feels like
It is like cherry pie, you can't deny it
Driving fast, you had to try it
Oh, that's what it feels like
Letting Tony touch you everywhere
Breaking rules and didn't care
Oh, baby, that's what it feels like

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
I can be your cherry pie
And you can be my cream on top, come on
I can be your cherry pie
And you can be my cream on top, yeah

[Chorus]
It is like cherry pie, you can't deny it
Driving fast, you had to try it
Oh, that's what it feels like
Letting Tony touch you everywhere
Breaking rules and didn't care
Oh, baby, that's what it feels like
It is like cherry pie, you can't deny it (Cherry pie)
Driving fast, you had to try it
Letting Tony touch you everywhere
Breaking rules and didn't care
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Baby, when I think about
The day that we first met (The day that we first met)
Wasn't looking for what I found
But I found you and I'm bound to
Find happiness in being around you

[Chorus]
I'm glad when I'm making love to you
I'm glad for the way you make me feel
I love it 'cause you seem to blow my mind
Every time
I'm glad (I'm glad) when you walk (I'm glad), you hold my hand (I'm glad)
I'm happy that you know how to be a man
I'm glad (I'm glad) that you came into my life (I'm glad)
I'm so glad (I'm glad)

[Verse 2]
I dig the way that you get down (You get down thugged out)
And you still know how to hold me (And you still know how to hold me)
Perfect blend, masculine (Can't get enough now)
I think I'm in love, damn, finally

[Chorus]
I'm glad when I'm making love to you
I'm glad for the way you make me feel
I love it 'cause you seem to blow my mind
Every time
I'm glad (I'm glad) when you walk (I'm glad), you hold my hand (I'm glad)
I'm happy that you know how to be a man
I'm glad (I'm glad) that you came into my life (I'm glad)
I'm so glad (I'm glad)

[Bridge]
I'm glad that you (Glad that you)
Turned out to be (Turned out to be)
That certain someone special
Who makes this life worth living (Worth living)
I'm glad you're here (I'm glad that you are here)
Just loving me (Just loving me)
So say that you won't leave (No)
'Cause since the day you came, I've been glad (Glad)

[Chorus]
I'm glad when I'm making love to you
I'm glad for the way you make me feel
I love it 'cause you seem to blow my mind
Every time
I'm glad (I'm glad) when you walk (I'm glad), you hold my hand (I'm glad)
I'm happy that you know how to be a man
I'm glad (I'm glad) that you came into my life (I'm glad)
I'm so glad (I'm glad)

[Verse 1]
People told me I should write a love song
"Girl, you sound so angry, you could use some variation"
But I'm lonely, negative relations
I've been hurt so many times, I don't have the patience

[Pre-Chorus]
But I've wished for so long
For someone to come and show me, lead by example
'Cause I've been waiting
I've tried every age, I'm so tired of the game
(I) I wanna be somebody's girl
Would you show me the way?

[Chorus]
What if I never find, and I'm left behind?
Should I keep hoping for love?
What if I'm still the same, status doesn't change?
Gotta keep hoping for love
What is love? What is love? What is love?
Somebody show me
What is love? What is love? What is love?
'Cause if you told me
What is love? What is love? What is love?
I wouldn't be lonely (What is love?)
Please, show me (What is love?)

[Verse 2]
I've had blind dates hooked up with some real flakes
I've gone out with church boys, musicians are the worst
I've tried so hard, 'cause I'm just so die hard
Tried my best to play the part, wish you could see inside

[Pre-Chorus]
But I've wished for so long
For someone to come and show me, lead by example
'Cause I've been waiting
I've tried every age, I'm so tired of the game
(I) I wanna be somebody's girl
Would you show me the way?

[Chorus]
What if I never find, and I'm left behind?
Should I keep hoping for love?
What if I'm still the same, status doesn't change?
Gotta keep hoping for love
What is love? What is love? What is love?
Somebody show me
What is love? What is love? What is love?
'Cause if you told me
What is love? What is love? What is love?
I wouldn't be lonely (What is love?)
Please, show me (What is love?)

[Bridge]
I've been alone for the past three years on Valentine's Day
Christmas is no exception, birthday's with naughty presents
Been back and forth, same action, I just need this to happen
I'll be singing love's praises, if you would show me

[Chorus]
What if I never find, and I'm left behind?
Should I keep hoping for love?
What if I'm still the same, status doesn't change?
Gotta keep hoping for love
What is love? What is love? What is love?
Somebody show me
What is love? What is love? What is love?
'Cause if you told me

[Intro: Darkchild]
Aha
Right here, it's another Darkchild collab, you know?
Something that you can lean to
Something that you can ride to
Something that you can step to, you know?
We back
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1]
Sometimes real love can be
Not seen 'cause you're thinking
What's right in front of you can't be the one for you
Then one day you realize that
There are feelings that you can't hold back
And you're so caught up, now that's all you think of
Crazy how

[Pre-Chorus]
All that talk of us not able to last (Oh)
Just because of mistakes we made in the past
But they fail to understand

[Chorus]
I got you and nobody can come and change a thing
'Cause you gotta know you got me
And it feels so good to have your back now
I'm so proud I've got you
And if somebody tries to take you from me
They will see I've got you
You got me, I got you

[Verse 2]
Things are often said to doubt what I feel for you
But words that people say won't take my love away
Although it hurts sometimes, it's alright
But why they say some things that ain't right?
I never know but please understand that, baby, it ain't nothing

[Pre-Chorus]
All that talk of us not able to last
Just because of mistakes we made in the past
But they fail to understand

[Chorus]
I got you and nobody can come and change a thing (Ooh, no)
'Cause you gotta know you got me (You got me, yeah)
And it feels so good to have your back now
I'm so proud I've got you
And if somebody tries to take you from me (Proud)
They will see I've got you (I got you, baby)
You got me (You got me, baby)
I got you (I got you, baby)
You got me (You got me, baby)

[Bridge]
Talk is all that people can do
Nevermind all the love
All that you gotta do is simply love
Trust, and just stay or there's no "us"
Together we will get through whatever if we
Don't let speculations make situations up
We'll be alright

[Chorus]
I got you and nobody can come and change a thing (Nobody, nobody)
'Cause you gotta know you got me
And it feels so good to have your back now
I'm so proud I've got you
And if somebody tries to take you from me (Oh-woah)
They will see I've got you (I got you, baby)
You got me (You got me, baby)
I got you, oh, and nobody can come and change a thing (Feels so good inside)
'Cause you gotta know you got me (You got me, yeah)
And it feels so good to have your back now
I'm so proud I've got you
And if somebody tries to take you from me (Oh, baby, they'll see)
They will see I've got you (I've got you)

[Outro]
You got me (Yes, you got me, baby)
I got you (Nothing come between us)
You got me (You got me)
I got you (Through whatever)
You got me (You're all that I need)
I got you (Oh, baby)
You got me (Forever, baby)
I got you (I got you)
You got me (You got me)
I got you, you got me
I got you, and you got me

[Verse 1]
Do you remember what you said to me the day I met you?
Like yesterday, I still can hear your voice, you promised to be
Still in my life no matter what you had to do to be there
Well, it's been a while and here we are looking back on times that we've shared

[Pre-Chorus]
I still imagine us being young and so in love
Never apart, you were my heart
Feels like it's always just been us

[Chorus]
I remember we were in the park
Holding hands and you said to me
I'm the only thing you need
And I would make your life complete
If I said I'd be your girl
You would stay with me forever
Boy, you never let me down
Through it all you're still around (Still around, yeah)

[Verse 2]
I still believe in all the things you said to me in those days
You gave me love and kept your word with every promise you made
I sing your favorite song inside my head when you're not with me
Until you come back home and take me in your arms and hold me

[Pre-Chorus]
I still imagine us being young and still in love
Never apart, you were my heart
Makes me smile, we're still in love

[Chorus]
I remember we were in the park
Holding hands and you said to me
I'm the only thing you need
And I would make your life complete
If I said I'd be your girl
You would stay with me forever
Boy, you never let me down
Through it all you're still around

[Verse 3]
Looking back through all the years
You remember the first time I went to your house?
And your father looked at me like I had three heads?
I'll never forget the day
We were so in love
Looking back through all the years
You were so beautiful and so young
I never will forget the day you came into my life and what you said to me
I can't believe you're still mine, that's crazy
I love you

[Chorus]
I remember we were in the park
Holding hands and you said to me (We were in the park, holding hands)
I'm the only thing you need
And I would make your life complete
If I said I'd be your girl
You would stay with me forever (Never let you down, my baby)
Boy, you never let me down
Through it all you're still around (Still around, yeah)
I remember we were in the park (Ooh)
Holding hands and you said to me (Ooh)
I'm the only thing you need
And I would make your life complete
If I said I'd be your girl and
You would stay with me forever (Ooh)
Boy, you never let me down
Through it all you're still around (Still around, yeah)

[Intro]
Uh
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I could wait all night and day
To go to a party, sit down and wait
Give my request to the DJ
'Cause my song, he's gotta play (Just play my song)
And when I hear that beat, I get my body up out my seat
I grab a guy and move my feet
He's playing my song

[Chorus]
Play, come on play that song
Play it all night long
Just turn it up and turn it on
Play, come on, DJ, play that song
You know that it turns me on (DJ, just play that song)
Just turn it up and turn it on
DJ, just play that song
'Cause I wanna be dancing (DJ) all night long
Play my, play my, play my, play my
Play my favorite song (Uh)

[Verse 2]
I don't care if everybody's gone
Turn it up 'cause it turns me on
Keep dancing all night long
Feels so right that it can't be wrong (Can't be wrong)
I get chills up and down my spine
Whenever I hear that song of mine
When it stops, better press rewind (Play that shit again)
Let me hear it one more time

[Chorus]
Play, come on play that song
Play it all night long
Just turn it up and turn it on
Play, come on, DJ, play that song
You know that it turns me on (DJ, just play that song)
'Cause I wanna be dancing all night long (You know this song)
Play, come on play that song
Play it all night long
Just turn it up, and turn it on (One more time)
Play, come on, DJ, play that song
You know that it turns me on (DJ, just play that song)
'Cause I wanna be dancing all night long

[Bridge]
I just wanna dance, is that a crime?
Alright then
Ooh, uh
Oh (Alright)
(Yeah, that's the hotness right here)
(Play, play, play, play)
Play, come on play that song (Now, Mr. DJ)
Play it all night long (I've asked you three times already)
DJ, just play that song
Just turn it up and turn it on (Play my motherfuckin' song)
Play, come on, DJ, play that song (Haha)
You know that it turns me on (DJ, just play that song)
(Turn it up, turn it up)
'Cause I wanna be dancing all night long
(Turn it up, turn it up, turn the track)

[Chorus]
Play, come on play that song (Oh)
Play it all night long
Just turn it up and turn it on
Play, come on, DJ, play that song
You know that it turns me on (DJ, just play that song)
'Cause I wanna be dancing all night long
Play, come on play that song (Turn it up)
Play it all night long (Play it all night long)
Just turn it up, and turn it on
Play, come on, DJ, play that song (Uh-huh)
You know that it turns me on (DJ, just play that song)
Just turn it up, and turn it on

[Intro]
I'm crazy over you
I don't know what to do
I don't understand why I'm crazy over you (Ooh, ooh)
I don't know what to do

[Verse 1]
If I had to, I would give up everything just to feel and be with you
If I had to, I would pawn the ring you gave to me just to feed you
If I had to, I would give my very last breath just to help save you
And If I had to, I would tell a lie just because I know you are the truth

[Chorus]
Ooh, I'd ride for you 'cause you're the truth
I'd die for you, ooh, 'cause I'm a fool in love with you
And I'll do anything that pleases you
Only you

[Verse 2]
If I had to, I would throw away my only wish just to prove to you
If I had to, I would die all alone living there without you
If I had to, I would go through all the pain again just to find you
If I had to, I'd surrender all my love just because I love you

[Refrain]
I don't understand why I'm crazy over you
I don't know what to do (Over)
I don't understand why I'm crazy over you (Don't understand, I)
I don't know what to do (Over you, don't know, oh, oh)

[Chorus]
Ooh, I'd ride for you 'cause you're the truth (Oh, yeah, the truth)
I'd die for you, ooh, 'cause I'm a fool in love with you (Fool)
And I'll do anything that pleases you (And I'll do anything, anything, ooh, ooh)
Ooh, I'd ride for you 'cause you're the truth (I'll ride)
I'd die for you, ooh, 'cause I'm a fool in love with you (In love, yeah)
And I'll do anything that pleases you (Yeah, that pleases you)
Only you

[Bridge]
I wanna run to you
Breathe as one with you
Absent in time without you
Existing only for you
Every dream is of you
Only turn to you, my baby, my love
Only turn to you

[Chorus]
Ooh, I'd ride for you 'cause you're the truth
I'd die for you, ooh, 'cause I'm a fool in love with you
And I'll do anything that pleases you (I'm gonna ride for you)
Ooh, I'd ride for you 'cause you're the truth (Ooh, 'cause you're the truth)
I'd die for you, ooh, 'cause I'm a fool in love with you (Oh, yeah, 'cause I'm a fool)
And I'll do anything that pleases you (Yeah, oh, yeah, that pleases you)
Only you

[Outro]
I'd ride for you 'cause you're the truth
I'd die for you, ooh, 'cause I'm a fool in love with you
And I'll do anything that pleases you
Yeah

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Said she gave you everything
She broke her back to be what you need
I tried so long to just compete
Can't take no more, losing sight of me
I'm letting you know this can't go on
This one-way street, I'm walking alone
This time I'm breaking free
I'm gonna find me

[Chorus]
I can't sit and be passive
Won't tolerate no more, that's it
I tried so hard to be (Tried so hard to be)
What you wanted me to be (Wanted me to be)
If it can't be 50/50
Then know that it don't fit me
I can't give you all that's in me
'Cause, baby, that's not me

[Verse 2]
Don't want you to think that I'm selfish
I'm just sick of your one track mess
If you can't meet me halfway
I think it's time that you be on your way
I love you, but I can't baby you
If it's your mama you want, you know just what to do
I looked in the mirror every day
I saw myself fading away
You trying to mold me into her
I loved you so I put you first
But I can't live my life this way

[Chorus]
I can't sit and be passive
Won't tolerate no more, that's it
I tried so hard to be (Tried so hard to be)
What you wanted me to be (Wanted me to be)
If it can't be 50/50
Then know that it don't fit me
I can't give you all that's in me
'Cause, baby, that's not me

[Verse 3]
I was so lost in love before
I couldn't see the light
But now I'm strong enough to leave you now
So you better treat me right
Don't want to throw it all away
So, baby, here's your last chance
Don't wanna fight with you but I need more of you
Give me all or it's the end

[Chorus]
I can't sit and be passive
Won't tolerate no more, that's it (I won't)
I tried so hard to be (Tried so hard to be, I tried)
What you wanted me to be (Wanted me to be)
If it can't be 50/50 (No, no, no)
Then know that it don't fit me
I can't give you all that's in me
'Cause, baby, that's not me

[Bridge]
I cooked, I cleaned, I washed your clothes (You know I did)
You were so mean, so ungrateful (So ungrateful)
At night I cried so many times
Tell me how could you go diss me (How could you go diss me)
When you know one day you'll miss me (Know one day you'll miss me)
If it can't be 50/50
Then, baby, that's not me

[Chorus]
I can't sit and be passive (Baby, that's not me)
Won't tolerate no more, that's it (Baby, that's not me)
I tried so hard to be (Tried so hard to be)
What you wanted me to be (Wanted me to be)
If it can't be 50/50 (I can't, I won't)
Then know that it don't fit me
I can't give you all that's in me (I can't, I won't)
'Cause, baby, that's not me
I can't sit and be passive  (Oh)
Won't tolerate no more, that's it
I tried so hard to be (Tried so hard to be, oh)
What you wanted me to be (Wanted me to be)
If it can't be 50/50
Then know that it don't fit me
I can't give you all that's in me
'Cause, baby, that's not me
I can't sit and be passive
Won't tolerate no more, that's it
I tried so hard to be (Tried so hard to be)
What you wanted me to be (Wanted me to be)
If it can't be 50/50
Then know that it don't fit me
I can't give you all that's in me
'Cause, baby, that's not me

[Outro]
No, no
No, no

[Intro]
Uh, we got it locked, but they know (Hey)
And what whenever we around it goes down like Draino (Hey, hey)
Uh, and it's nothing to spend these pesos (Okay, yeah)
And you will never see us with a fake, no (Now put it in my album for me)
Uh, getting colder than them low lows
Rollies on our arms worth a thousand and the charm
Ain't nothing greater
Hanging out the window, straight busting at you love haters (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Bonnie, Clyde (Yeah)
No other girl will ever ride like I ride
That's why you need me on your passenger side
Let me help you get that paper
Hanging out the window busting at them love haters (Yeah)
Me and you (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
I'm the closest you'll ever be to truth (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
There's never a question of what I'll do, uh-huh, for you
With me, you'll never lose, so (That's right)

[Chorus]
Call on your girl that can hold you right
I'll be your protector, I'll never forget ya
You need somebody that can hold you tight (That's right)
I'll be your armor, keep you out of harm, boy (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
I'll be your anything, everything
Rock 'n roll with ya (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
If things get too hot out in the cold with ya (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Froze, froze with ya
Me and you together, our love could run the world
Oh, oh, run the world
Oh, oh, our love could run the world
Oh, oh, run the world
Oh, oh, our love could run the world
Hanging out the window, straight busting at you love haters

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, I'll be your anything, everything
Oh, oh, rock 'n roll with ya
If things get too hot out in the cold with ya
Oh, oh, froze, froze with ya
Oh, oh, me and you together, our love could run the world
Run, run, run, run it
Run, run, run, run it
Run, run, run, run it
Run, run, run, run it

[Verse 2]
Make it through any weather, baby (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Don't pay them any attention, it'll just drive you crazy
All that really matters is our love for one another
And all we'll ever have is each other (Yeah)
Let a chick try to come around
We both know she'll never be down
She'll never have your back, wouldn't know how to act (Sure)
I can't say it no better than that (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Call on your girl that can hold you right (Okay)
I'll be your protector, I'll never forget ya (Yeah)
You need somebody that can hold you tight (Yeah)

Hanging out the window, straight busting at you love haters
Run, run, run, run it
Run, run, run, run it
Run, run, run, run it
Run, run, run, run it
Our love could run the world

[Bridge]
Don't you see there's no love like you and me?
Can't you see, baby, there's nobody more powerful than we?
Can't you see that I'm the only thing you'll ever need?
Can't you see that? (Yeah) Can't you see that?
I love you, baby

Our love could run the world
Oh, oh, run the world

[Verse 1]
I can't wait, wanna see how this night is gonna be
Just a touch away from the feeling that is here to stay

[Pre-Chorus]
We can make it last forever, baby
Our love will stand the test of time (Yeah)
In the middle of the world
I'll be waiting for you to be all mine (Yeah)

[Chorus]
We're walking on sunshine in the middle of the night
And it feels like I'm somewhere above the sky-y-y-y

[Verse 2]
Take my hand, close your eyes
Say the sweet little things that make me cry
Catch my tears with a kiss
These special moments do exist

[Pre-Chorus]
We can make it last forever, baby
Our love will stand the test of time (Yeah)
In the middle of the world
I'll be waiting for you to be all mine (Yeah)

[Chorus]
We're walking on sunshine in the middle of the night
And it feels like I'm somewhere above the sky-y-y-y

[Bridge]
Let's take a chance, and try love, baby
No, I'm not giving up
'Til you tell me that you'll be in my life
Until the end of time
(Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
We're walking on sunshine in the middle of the night
And it feels like I'm somewhere above the sky-y-y-y

[Bridge]
Let's take a chance, and try love, baby (Try love)
No, I'm not giving up
'Til you tell me that you'll be in my life ('Til you, that you'll)
Until the end of time
(Yeah, yeah)
Oh, woah-oh-oh (Yeah, yeah)
Oh, woah-oh-oh (Yeah, yeah)
Oh, woah, oh, woah (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
We're walking on sunshine in the middle of the night (Walking on sunshine, middle of the night, yeah)
And it feels like I'm somewhere above the sky-y-y-y (Sky)
We're walking on sunshine in the middle of the night (Walking on sunshine, middle of the night)
And it feels like I'm somewhere above the sky-y-y-y (The sky, so high. so high)
We're walking on sunshine in the middle of the night (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And it feels like I'm somewhere above the sky-y-y-y (Somewhere, the sky)
We're walking on sunshine in the middle of the night (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Intro]
Estoy
Loca
Enamorada
De ti

[Verse 1]
It seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me
It's so ironic you're what I had pictured you to be
But there are facts in our lives we can never change
Just tell me that you understand and feel the same
This perfect romance that I've created in my mind (In my mind)
I'd live a thousand lives, each one with you right by my side
But yet we find ourselves in a less-than-perfect circumstance (Ooh)
And so it seems like we'll never have the chance

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Oh)
And you can't move on even though you try? (Oh)
Ain't it strange when you’re feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Oh)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right? (No)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart?

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I think that a true love can never be (Never be)
I just believe that somehow it wasn't meant for me (Ooh)
Life can be cruel in a way that I can't explain
And I don't think that I could face it all again
I barely know you but somehow I know what you're about (You're about)
A deeper love I've found in you, and I no longer doubt (Ooh)
You've touched my heart, and it altered every plan I've made
And now I feel that I don't have to be afraid

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Oh)
And you can't move on even though you try? (Oh)
Ain't it strange when you’re feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Oh)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right? (No)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart?

[Bridge]
I locked away my heart
But you just set it free
Emotions I felt
Held me back from what my life should be (Ooh)
I pushed you far away
And yet you stayed with me
I guess this means
That you and me were meant to be

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Oh)
And you can't move on even though you try?
Ain't it strange when you’re feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Oh, I wish this could be real (Oh, yeah)
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life  (Oh, yeah)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right? (No, no)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart? (Oh, yeah)
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Funny)
And you can't move on even though you try? (Even if you try)
Ain't it strange when you’re feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Baby, ain't it funny?
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life (Change your life)
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right? (Wrong or right)
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
Baby, ain't it funny?
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny (Can't deny)
And you can't move on even though you try? (Even though you try)
Ain't it strange when you’re feeling things you shouldn't feel?
Baby
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life?
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right?
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try?
Ain't it strange when you’re feeling things you shouldn't feel?

[Verse 1]
Baby, never have I ever wanted anyone
Like I want you, babe
Come and let me show you just how much I feel inside
I got so much love

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh baby, when I get near you
Ooh, I can't control what I'm feeling, baby
I got so much love to give you
That I would probably want you all the time

[Chorus]
Cariño, quédate conmigo, cariño
(Gotta have your love)
Cariño, quédate conmigo, cariño
(Need to feel your touch)
Cariño, quédate conmigo, cariño
(Never get enough)
Cariño, cariño

[Verse 2]
I wish that I could spend all my days and nights
Wrapped in your arms spending time with you
Because all I see in this world is me and you and no one else
Ooh, I want you more and more

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh baby, please understand me
I think that you deserve me, oh, yeah
Because I'm the type that would give you
All the love and affection that you need

[Chorus]
Cariño, quédate conmigo, cariño
(Gotta have your love)
Cariño, quédate conmigo, cariño
(Need to feel your touch)
Cariño, quédate conmigo, cariño

Cariño, quédate conmigo, cariño
(Need to feel your touch)
Cariño, quédate conmigo, cariño
(Never get enough)
Cariño, cariño

[Interlude]
Así, un poquito más suavecito, ah
Ajá, así es que me gusta, huh
¡Ahora, ahora! Huh
¡Eso!

[Chorus]
Cariño, quédate conmigo, cariño
(Gotta have your love)
Cariño, quédate conmigo, cariño
(Need to feel your touch)
Cariño, quédate conmigo, cariño
(Never get enough)
Cariño, cariño

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Cariño, quédate conmigo, cariño
(Gotta have your love)
Cariño, quédate conmigo, cariño
(Need to feel your touch)
Cariño, quédate conmigo, cariño
(Never get enough)
Cariño, cariño

[Outro]
Cariño, quédate conmigo, cariño

[Verse 1]
I know better than anybody how it feels
To want somebody so bad after you break up
Still looking for that phone call
Still, even when they don't call
Still ain't ready to walk away and call it all over
Act like you wasn't listening when they told you
They don't want to be with you anymore
Stuck in your ways, you choose to ignore

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause in your mind, you're still together
Thought it would last, but there's no forever
Walked out on you with no call, no letter
When he realize it don't get no better

[Chorus]
He'll be back to make up for the lonely days
He'll be back when things ain't working out his way
He'll be back when he sees that it's not the same
He'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back
He knows he's gonna need his lady
He'll be back when his boys say he must be crazy
He'll be back, he'll know he made a big mistake
He'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back

[Verse 2]
You don't want to believe it but you see it happening
Wakes you up out of your sleep, out of the dreams you're having
Still looking for his return
Still hoping that he's gonna learn
Wake up, and realize the truth
Make some time for you
What is he trying to do to you?
Miss him more as days go by
Try your hardest not to cry and keep hope alive

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause in your mind, you're still together
Thought it would last, but there's no forever
Walked out on you with no call, no letter
When he realize it don't get no better

[Chorus]
He'll be back to make up for the lonely days
He'll be back when things ain't working out his way
He'll be back when he sees that it's not the same
He'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back
He knows he's gonna need his lady
He'll be back when his boys say he must be crazy
He'll be back, he'll know he made a big mistake
He'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back

[Bridge]
Thinking, oh, oh, every, ooh, wanting, haunting
Thinking, oh, oh, every, ooh, wanting, haunting
He'll be back, thinking, oh, oh, every, ooh, wanting, haunting
Thinking, oh, oh, every, ooh, wanting, haunting

[Chorus]
He'll be back to make up for the lonely days
He'll be back when things ain't working out his way
He'll be back when he sees that it's not the same
He'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back
He knows he's gonna need his lady
He'll be back when his boys say he must be crazy
He'll be back, he'll know he made a big mistake
He'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back

[Intro]
Maybe, I need to see you
Oh, oh, oh
Please, come over

[Verse 1]
One, you come to my room for a little game
To you, I'll do very erotic things
I want to make love, babe, very slowly
Three times in a row, all night I'll go

[Chorus]
I love when you come over
Please come over
And when you come, it gives me fever
Come over

[Verse 2]
Body next to mine, love dance, syncopated time
Sugar rush keeps me high, sweet kiss on my thigh
I wanna make love, baby, very badly
Feels good in the air every time you're here

[Chorus]
I love when you come over
Please come over
And when you come, it gives me fever
Come over

[Verse 3]
Don't keep me waiting, anticipating
Love, I am saving for you (Ooh)
Hear what I'm saying, you I am craving
Love is here waiting for you (Ooh)
All day you're staying, please no delaying (Oh)
Patiently waiting for you
Don't keep me waiting, no time for playing
Sitting here waiting for you

[Chorus]
Come over
I love when you come over (Please come over)
Please come over (I need to see you)
And when you come, it gives me fever
Come over (I need to see you)
I love when you come over (Make it so)
Please come over (I love when you come over, come on, baby, don't make me wait)
And when you come (I need you), it gives me fever
Come over (I can't wait anymore, oh)

[Outro]
I love when you come over (I love it)
And when you come, it gives me fever (It gives me fever, oh)
I love when you come over
And when you come, it gives me fever

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Took a shot with the bad boy from the block
And picked my love right from the start
Mister wrong, he plays his part
Back to the beginning, now round two
Try my luck with something new
We danced until we said "I do"
My luck is bad, no more us two
No me and you (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it too much to ask for a real love?
Something that'll last

[Chorus]
Is there one love only once in a lifetime?
It's so hard to find the perfect one to call mine
Is there one love, somebody that compliments me
And makes me want to never leave?
Made just right for me
Is there one love? (Woah-oh-oh)
One love (Woah-oh-oh)
One love (Woah-oh-oh)
One love (Woah-oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
It's take three, could there be a part for me?
Came and swept me off my feet
Went nowhere, but kept the ring
Once again, I'm lonely
Number four, he sang to me but I'm not sure
So worn out, but love just saw
Made me want to try once more
And I couldn't say no (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it too much to ask for a real love?
Something that'll last?

[Chorus]
Is there one love only once in a lifetime?
It's so hard to find the perfect one to call mine
Is there one love, somebody that compliments me
And makes me want to never leave?
Made just right for me
Is there one love? (Woah-oh-oh)
One love (Woah-oh-oh)
One love (Woah-oh-oh)
One love (Woah-oh-oh)

[Bridge]
What's wrong with the girl wanting everything?
Good love, real trust, true meaning, oh
Who truly completes me?
I'm good on my own, but I have to know

[Chorus]
Is there one love only once in a lifetime?
It's so hard to find the perfect one to call mine
Is there one love (Oh), somebody that compliments me (Oh)
And makes me want to never leave? (Oh)
Made just right for me
Is there one love? (Woah-oh-oh)
One love (Woah-oh-oh)
One love (Woah-oh-oh)
One love (Woah-oh-oh)
Is there one love? (Woah-oh-oh)
One love (Woah-oh-oh)
One love (Woah-oh-oh)
One love (Woah-oh-oh)
Is there one love?

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
How can you just say that you love me, yet to leave you alone?
You said these walls were here to protect us, but it's still not a home
All these questions that are burning inside with answers I'll never know
'Cause you're the only one who knows how you feel, but you're not letting me know

[Pre-Chorus]
What is it, love? Can I help you?
I see where this has gone and what it's coming to
I've looked to you enough

[Chorus]
I can't believe this is me
Where I can touch and not feel you
I feel I'm lost in a dream between what is and what seems
Having to face not to need you
You know you owe it to me
How can you think we don't need you?
I'm tired of running away from my fear
And the day that our life has no meaning
Without a word or a reason
Like a coward, you're leaving

[Verse 2]
Sitting here inside an empty room that was filled with us
Only boxes to define what was left of what we used to call love
It's sad that after all of this time, you have nothing to say
And the only thing that you could have done, you choose to walk away

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm thankful, love, I don't hate you
'Cause I'd rather live and know than what you put me through
I needed you somehow

[Chorus]
I can't believe this is me
Where I can touch and not feel you
I feel I'm lost in a dream between what is and what seems
Having to face not to need you
You know you owe it to me
How can you think we don't need you?
I'm tired of running away from my fear
And the day that our life has no meaning
Without a word or a reason
Like a coward, you're leaving
I can't believe this is me
I was a fool to believe you
I feel I'm lost in a dream between what is and what seems
Having to face not to need you
How could you do this to me?
How can you think we don't need you?
I'm tired of running away from my fear
And the day that our life has no meaning
Without a word or a reason
Like a coward, you're leaving

[Chorus]
Ooh baby, come and talk to me
Together we can work this out
We got a love thing
We're talking about

[Verse 1]
The way you looked at me tells me you're sorry
You walked by me whispering you love me
When I tried to hold you tight you pulled away
But you wanted me to stay, instead you ran away
Baby, talk to me, let's stop playing games
Don't turn away from me, just look me straight in the eyes
Don't try to sweet talk me with those nasty words you say
Baby, just be real and tell me how you feel

[Chorus]
Ooh baby, come and talk to me (Together)
Together we can work this out
We got a love thing
We're talking about

[Verse 2]
The way you tricked me you know that wasn't right, ooh
You tried to fix it but all we did was fight
Because I gave you everything I had to give
If you know it's worth the fight, we got to compromise
Baby, talk to me and tell me what's wrong
Come sit down next to me and let me feel the vibe you're on
Come lay your head on me and everything will be alright
But we must communicate, tomorrow it could be too late

[Chorus]
Ooh baby, come and talk to me
Together we can work this out (Talk to me, baby)
We got a love thing
We're talking about

[Bridge]
'Cause I love you, boy, and I need you here
Together we can make this thing work out
To think about what we could miss
It makes me want to lose my mind
Talk to me
Come on, come on, come on
Talk to me
Oh
Ooh
Oh, oh, come on
Make me wanna dream, baby

[Chorus]
Ooh baby, come and talk to me (Baby, talk to me, baby)
Together we can work this out
We got a love thing
We're talking about (Talk to me, baby)
Ooh baby, come and talk to me (Baby)
Together we can work this out
We got a love thing
We're talking about (Talk to me, baby, talk to me, baby)
Ooh baby, come and talk to me (Mmm, mmm, together)
Together we can work this out
We got a love thing
We're talking about (Talk to me, baby, talk to me, baby)
Ooh baby, come and talk to me
Together we can work this out
We got a love thing
We're talking about (Talking to you, talking to you, baby)
Ooh baby, come and talk to me (Mmm, mmm)
Together we can work this out
We got a love thing
We're talking about (Talking to you, baby, talking to you, baby)

[Outro]
Ooh baby, come and talk to me
Together we can work this out
We got a love thing
We're talking about

[Intro: Fabolous]
Guess who? J to the Lo
F to the AB
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
I ain't Mr. Right, I'm Mr. Right Now (Oh)
I keep women in thongs coming along (Oh)
Invisibly set stones, some of them prone (Woo)
I can tell you that you never had someone this long
One night, have them bumpin' my song like mmm, mmm, girl
You ain't know I was coming this strong
Now you know not to come at me wrong
I get right, uh

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
You're looking just a little too hard at me
Standing just a little too close to me
You're saying not quite enough to me
You're sipping just a little too slow for me
No doubt you play it real cool, homie
Got me thinking what is it you do for me?
Tripping (Tripping) a little more than I should be
So let yourself go and get right with me

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, we can get right
(We can get right)
I'm about to fill your cup, so we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, tonight
(We can get right)

[Post-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Yeah, huh
Yeah, huh
Yeah, huh
Yeah, huh

[Verse 3: Jennifer Lopez]
Your lips talking 'bout I, "Play too much"
Can't a woman take advantage of what she wants?
My hips moving, oh, so slow (So slow)
Bar tab looking like a car note (Car note)
All I need is you here right by my side (Woo)
Take whatever you want, baby, let's ride (Oh)
And whatever you won't do, let me decide
Just put your name on the dotted line

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, we can get right (Yeah)
(We can get right)
I'm about to fill your cup, so we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, tonight
(We can get right)

[Post-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Yeah, huh
Yeah, huh
Yeah, huh
Yeah, huh

[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez]
So much we've got to say, but so little time
And if tonight ain't long enough, don't leave love behind
(Don't leave this love behind)
Baby, take my hand, I'll show you why

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Fabolous]
I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, we can get right
(We can get right)
I'm about to fill your cup, so we can get right (Oh)
Before the night is up, we can get right tonight (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
(We can get right)

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
It's slim with the tilted rim on 20 inch rims
Rock up wrist watch, six inch Timbs
Button-up shirt cuffed with the French trim
So you can tell a man get to the right (Oh)
I'm in the driver's seat, you sit to the right (Oh)
And this is just to get to the flight (Oh)
I like the way it fit to you tight
So I'ma show you the world in a day
'Fore it even get to the night
I'm lookin' for a dime, but I don't need a penny though
Any old wanna be Jenny-Lo, no
Plenty dough and there's plenty mo' where it come from
I am the real talk where I come from, ho

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, we can get right
(We can get right)
I'm about to fill your cup, so we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right tonight
(We can get right)
I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, we can get right
(We can get right)
I'm about to fill your cup, so we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right tonight
(We can get right)

[Verse 1]
Taking away the fact that I care about you, it's just your way
So sweet, everything seems right around you
Did you know that you had this calming way about you when you touch?
And I wanna know if I could be your girl

[Chorus]
The one put her arms around you
The one who lays her head beside you (Your girl)
The one who listens when you need it
When no one else is, I could see it (Your girl)
The one who knows when it's under control
The one who knows your favorite song (Your girl)
The one you want when you're feeling lost
The one you place no one above

[Verse 2]
I'm happy to say in a lot of ways you've changed me
Makes me smile when you said you were glad the day you found me
I'm wishing away any harm that might ever find you
Heaven knows, I really feel I'll always be your girl

[Chorus]
The one put her arms around you
The one who lays her head beside you (Your girl)
The one who listens when you need it
When no one else is, I could see it (Your girl)
The one who knows when it's under control
The one who knows your favorite song (Your girl)
The one you want when you're feeling lost
The one you place no one above

[Break]
Your girl, your girl, your girl, your girl
I just want to be (The one who's true to you)
I just want to be (The one who makes you smile)
I just want to be (The one who holds you down)
Your girl, your girl, your girl (Your girl)

[Chorus]
The one put her arms around you
The one who lays her head beside you (Your girl)
The one who listens when you need it (Your girl)
When no one else is, I could see it (Your girl)
The one who knows when it's under control
The one who knows your favorite song (Your girl)
The one you want when you're feeling lost
The one you place no one above
(I wanna be your girl)
The one who's true to you and down for you
The one who makes you smile and laughs with you
The one who holds you down, I'm there for you
The one, the one, the one (Your girl)
(The one who knows when it's under control)
The one who's true to you and down for you
(The one who knows your favorite song)
The one who makes you smile and laughs with you (Your girl, the one you want when you're feeling lost)
The one who holds you down, I'm there for you
(The one you place no one above)
The one, the one, the one

[Outro]
The one who's true to you
The one who makes you smile (Got to be your girl)
The one who holds you down
The one, the one, the one (Your girl)
The one who's true to you (Your girl)
The one who makes you smile (Your girl, your girl)
The one who holds you down (Your girl)
The one, the one, the one
I can be anything you need

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
I've been so
Caught up in the thought of me and you
Even though I love
Someone else I know my heart belongs to you
Tell me, how did we ever let the situation get this far?
Maybe we should just try to hide the things we feel inside
Things I know we can't deny

[Chorus]
Should've never told you that I cared about you
Didn't think that it would be so bad
Should've never kissed you
Should've never held your hand
Gotta find a way to let these feelings go

[Verse 2]
What did I
Do the day I let you slip into my soul? (Into my soul)
It was then, when I
Realized that I would always want you in my life (In my life)
No one else can know
Of the things that we've been saying on the telephone
It would be so bad
If they ever knew that me and you were secretly into each other

[Chorus]
Should've never told you that I cared about you
Didn't think that it would be so bad
Should've never kissed you
Should've never held your hand
Gotta find a way to let these feelings go

[Bridge]
I'm so scared, trembling inside
'Cause I'm feeling like somebody else already knows
Oh my God, I love you both so much
And to have to choose between the two
Is hurting me so deep inside

[Chorus]
Should've never told you that I cared about you
Didn't think that it would be so bad
Should've never kissed you
Should've never held your hand
I don't ever wanna feel this way again
Should've never told you that I cared about you (Never, never)
Oh, oh
Should've never kissed you
(Should've never, ever, ever looked your way)
Should've never held your hand
(Or saw your face)

[Outro]
Should've never told you that I cared about you
(Mi amor, a veces tengo miedo que voy a tener que vivir esta vida sin ti)
Should've never kissed you
Should've never held your hand
(Que el mundo no nos va a dejar estar juntos)
(Que nunca mas voy a sentir tus manos sobre mi piel)
Should've never told you that I cared about you
(Amor mio, ¿qué voy a hacer sin ti?)
Should've never kissed you
(¿Qué voy a hacer sin ti?)
Should've never held your hand
(¿Qué voy a hacer?)
Should've never told you that I cared about you
(Este amor que es tan cruel y tan dulce a la misma vez)
Should've never kissed you
Should've never held your hand
(Tocame, una vez mas)
Should've never told you that I cared about you
(Ay asi, asi)
(Besame, besame como si fuera la ultima vez)
Should've never kissed you
Should've never held your hand
(Porque si puede ser)
Should've never told you that I cared about you
(Devorame, devorame)
Should've never kissed you
Should've never held your hand
(Te quiero ¿Y nunca lo arrepentire)

[Intro]
You're perfect

[Verse 1]
I just can't control myself
I can't be with no one else
It seems I'm addicted to the way you like to touch me
I don't think they understand
Why I love at your command
From the words you speak
So deep our bodies meet, I had to have you

[Chorus]
I love you, you're perfect
A manifestation of my dreams
You make my body feel
About a million different things

[Verse 2]
I think God made you for me
A mix of passionate fidelities
Baby, you're so complete
I write this song to let you know
That you will always be to me
My lust, my love, my man, my child, my friend, and my king

[Chorus]
I love you, you're perfect
A manifestation of my dreams
You make my body feel
About a million different things
There's no way I'd leave you
It's just not a reality
Sometimes I feel like I'm
Living in a fantasy

[Intro]
Come on
Faster
Now if you could just walk in
Dance
Haha

[Verse 1]
Too much is on your mind, gotta let it go
Can't worry all the time, just let it flow
You say you need a break, there's nothing I can do
Sitting here listening to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, what's this you tell me?
Things ain't been going your way, just take it from me
It's gonna be alright, so let's go out tonight
And we can leave all our cares behind

[Chorus]
Dance the night away (Dance)
Party 'til the sun comes up (Oh, yeah)
Go grab a friend, get on the floor
Come on and dance (Dance)
Dance (Dance)
Dance (Dance) with me
DJ, if you please

[Verse 2]
Nobody's on the wall, that's what I like
Come closer to me now and hold me tight
Tell me just how you're feeling right now
Are you really having a good time?

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, what's this you tell me?
Things ain't been going your way, just take it from me
It's gonna be alright, so let's go out tonight
And we can leave all our cares behind

[Chorus]
Dance the night away (All night)
Party 'til the sun comes up (Yeah)
Go grab a friend, get on the floor (Just dance)
Come on and dance (Dance)
Dance (Dance)
Dance (Dance) with me

[Refrain]
Just let yourself go (Go)
Dance on the floor (On the floor)
Nobody's stopping you (Stopping you)
Do what you wanna do (Do what you wanna do)
Just let the music take control (Control)
You can feel it in your soul
Come on and move your body to the groove

[Interlude]
Up, huh, uh
Come on, uh, uh, uh, uh

[Bridge]
Up in the club (The club)
Out on the floor (The floor)
Move to the beat (Come on, move your body)
Dancing with me (Come on, move your body)

Dance the night away

[Refrain]
Just let yourself go ('Self go)
Dance on the floor (On the floor)
Nobody's stopping you (Stopping you)
Do what you wanna do (Do what you wanna do)
Just let the music take control
You can feel it in your soul (In your soul)
Come on and move your body to the groove

[Chorus]
Dance the night away (Away)

[Chorus]
First you say that you have to go away
I never should've been with you anyway
And now you say you wanna stay
It's too late 'cause I'm sending you on your way
You say that you had to go away
I never really loved you anyway
And now you say you wanna stay
It's too late, it's too late

[Verse 1]
Like a puppet on a string
You came and took control of me
Would've given anything
To be your one and only
Filled my head with fantasies
Of what one day you would give to me
Full of hope for what could be
I sat and waited patiently

[Chorus]
First you say that you have to go away (Oh)
I never should've been with you anyway (I never should have been with you, baby)
And now you say you wanna stay
It's too late 'cause I'm sending you on your way (It's too late, oh)
You say that you had to go away (You had to go away)
I never really loved you anyway
And now you say you wanna stay
It's too late, it's too late

[Verse 2]
For a time you were for me
Everything that I could need
Gave me time and diamond rings
But something else was missing
You never stayed the whole night through
I suffered, prayed, and cried for you
After all that we've been through
I feel I never even knew you

[Chorus]
First you say that you have to go away
I never should've been with you anyway (Oh, no)
And now you say you wanna stay (It's too late, baby)
It's too late 'cause I'm sending you on your way (Oh, yes, I am)
You say that you had to go away (You had to go away)
I never really loved you anyway (Ooh)
And now you say you wanna stay
It's too late, it's too late

[Bridge]
There's no need to call me on the phone
I don't wanna hear from you no more
No need (No need), don't call (Don't call)
Don't be a fool and stand outside my door
'Cause being the woman that I am
I got to go on with other plans
Woah-oh-oh-oh, yes
Oh, yes
Ooh, ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
First you say that you have to go away (You have to go away)
I never should've been with you anyway
And now you say you wanna stay
It's too late 'cause I'm sending you on your way (It's too late, oh, yes it is, baby)
You say that you had to go away
I never really loved you anyway (I never loved you)
And now you say you wanna stay (It's too late)
It's too late, it's too late (It's too late)

[Outro]
It's too late, it's too late
(First you say that you have to go away)
It's too late, it's too late, oh
(I never should've been with you anyway)
Ooh
(And now you say you wanna stay)
You wanna stay, but it's too late, baby
(It's too late 'cause I'm sending you on your way)
(You say that you had to go away)
Oh
(I never really loved you anyway)
I never loved you anyway
(And now you say you wanna stay)
I never loved you anyway
(It's too late, it's too late)
I never loved you anyway
(First you say that you have to go away)
Oh, yeah
(I never should've been with you anyway)
Oh, baby
(And now you say you wanna stay)
Why'd you have to go away from me?
(It's too late 'cause I'm sending you on your way)
(You say that you had to go away)
Oh
(I never really loved you anyway)
I never loved you
(And now you say you wanna stay)
I never loved you anyway
(It's too late, it's too late)

[Verse 1]
I was down for the count
Feeling like I've come to the end
Nothing really mattered
Nothing left for me to mend
Ooh, but then you came, and I still couldn't see
'Til you tore down every wall in me
How you healed me with your patience
If it's all I ever do, I'll never stop loving you

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm alive, I can breathe, I can feel, I believe
And there ain't doubt about it, there ain't no doubt about it
I'm in love, and it's all because of you
I was fading, but you pulled me through
'Cause I'm awake, I survived, I was hurt, thought I'd die
But there ain't no doubt about it, it's love, and I have found it
Feel the beat again, stronger than before
I'm gonna give you my heart until it beats no more

[Verse 2]
Was in place full of pain
With a broken down heart in despair
He took away my feelings
And made it hard for me to care
Ooh, but then you crashed through the door, to my soul
Put back all the pieces and made me whole
I was living in the past, oh no
Now I'm never looking back, I'm never looking back

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm alive, I can breathe, I can feel, I believe
And there ain't doubt about it, there ain't no doubt about it
I'm in love, and it's all because of you
I was fading, but you pulled me through
'Cause I'm awake, I survived, I was hurt, thought I'd die
But there ain't no doubt about it, it's love, and I have found it
Feel the beat again, stronger than before
I'm gonna give you my heart until it beats no more

[Bridge]
Whatever you want me to
I'm gonna see you through
All I ever do
Never stop loving you

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm alive, I can breathe, I can feel, I believe (Hey, yay)
And there ain't doubt about it, there ain't doubt about it
I'm in love, and it's all because of you
I was fading, but you pulled me through (Fading but you pulled me through)
'Cause I'm awake, I survived, I was hurt (I was hurt), thought I'd die (Hey, yay)
And there ain't doubt about it, there's just no doubt (I'm much stronger)
Feel the beat again, stronger than before (So much stronger than before)
I'm gonna give you my heart until it beats no more

[Intro]
It's like I'm lost
I don't know
But this feeling that I have about you
Will you ever know?

[Chorus]
Secretly (I'm so crazy)
I'm wanting you (I don't know what to do)
And I'm hoping you want me too (I gotta work it out to tell you)
I smell your scent (Tell you how I feel) across the room (When I see you)
And I can't wait to get next to you (My heart feels like it's gonna explode)

[Verse 1]
Whatever I see (When I look at you across the room)
Whatever I hear (I wonder if he notice me too)
Whatever I do (I just think about you for hours)
Oh, baby, and it's got me thinking of you (It's crazy)

[Chorus]
Secretly
I'm wanting you
And I'm hoping you want me too (You look so good to me)
I smell your scent across the room (So sexy, damn)
And I can't wait to get next to you (Do I look sexy to you?)

[Verse 2]
Whenever you speak (Haha)
Whenever you move (That's what I think about)
Whenever you breathe (That's just the way I feel)
Baby, let me touch you (I don't know) please

[Chorus]
Secretly (I need to tell you)
I'm wanting you
And I'm hoping you want me too (I got a thing with you)
I smell your scent across the room (Do you see me?)
And I can't wait to get next to you ('Cause I see you)
Secretly
I'm wanting you
And I'm hoping you want me too (It's crazy)
I smell your scent across the room
And I can't wait to get next to you

[Outro]
You smell so good
I just wanna kiss you
I wanna lay with you
I don't know how to tell you

[Chorus]
It's invading my mind and breaking the ice, woah, I can't fight it
This feeling's invading my, my mind
I'm infected tonight, woah, I can't fight it
It's taking, invading my, my mind

[Verse 1]
Can't decide, can't define what I feel inside
It's still bad, it's still good, prefer and love
It's a rush, it's so rough, this is out of line
It's a storm and it rock, rock, rocks my boat

[Pre-Chorus]
My destiny, misery, your energy

[Chorus]
It's invading my mind and breaking the ice, woah, I can't fight it
This feeling's invading my, my mind
I'm infected tonight, woah, I can't fight it
It's taking, invading my, my mind
My mind, my mind
This feeling's invading my, my mind
My mind, my mind
It's taking, invading my, my mind

[Verse 2]
Like a wild wrecking ball, crashing block-by-block
I'm defenseless, it penetrates my walls
Freezing cold, steaming hot, sweaty drip-drip-drop
It's unstoppable, I can't shake it off

[Pre-Chorus]
My destiny, misery, your energy

[Chorus]
It's invading my mind and breaking the ice, woah, I can't fight it
This feeling's invading my, my mind
I'm infected tonight, woah, I can't fight it
It's taking, invading my, my mind
My mind, my mind
This feeling's invading my, my mind
My mind, my mind
It's taking, invading my, my mind

[Bridge]
It's taking me down and getting me high
It brings every fantasy to life
It's getting so loud, I hear it all around
And I just can't fight

[Chorus]
It's invading my mind and breaking the ice, woah, I can't fight it
This feeling's invading my, my mind
I'm infected tonight, woah, I can't fight it
It's taking, invading my, my mind
My mind, my mind
This feeling's invading my, my mind
My mind, my mind
It's taking, invading my, my mind
My mind, my mind
It's taking, invading my, my mind

[Intro]
Oh, yes
Yes, I did, baby
Yes, I did

[Verse 1]
It's funny 'cause for a while
I walked around with a smile
But deep inside, I could hear
Voices telling me this ain't right
Don't you know he's not for you?
I always knew what I had to do
But it's hard to get away
'Cause I love you, I just tried to stay

[Chorus]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes, I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh, yes)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright (I'ma be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes, I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh, yes)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

[Verse 2]
Friends of mine say to me
Say you got control over me
You're not alone, I played my part
I saw the way you were from the start
Could I expect so much from you?
You had a girl when I first met you
Did the best that you could do
Now I realize that I can't change you

[Chorus]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (Ooh)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright (Be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes, I did it)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh, yes)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

[Bridge]
Said I wouldn't walk away
Some days I want to stay (Days I want to stay)
But leaving you is what I need (Need to do) to do to be okay (For me to be okay)
Never thought it would be true (Would be true)
Me living without you (Living without you)
But now it's time for me to make that move, oh woah
Ah, ah

[Chorus]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (But I did, baby)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Wasn't with it)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it (To my eyes)
And I know inside I'ma be alright (Be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (But I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Wasn't with it)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (Oh, no)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright (Be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (I wasn't, no)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright
I said I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright

JLo

[Verse 1]
Now somehow you feel left out
Somehow you're feeling doubt
Got an inch but took a mile, oh no
Right now your body's in need
Can't replace what you had in me
My words are cutting deep, oh no

[Pre-Chorus]
You've watched me fall, now I'm colder than winter
My love you forgot, let me help you remember
I loved you like you never been
So overdosed on your own medicine

[Chorus]
There's no need to call me on the phone
Telling me how much you're alone
Enemy of my state of mind
Now I'm a villain, I'm the villain
I told you that you would need my love
I gave you my all, but that wasn't enough
Enemy of my state of mind
Now I'm a villain, baby, I'm the villain of your love

[Post-Chorus]
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love

[Verse 2]
Oh, now you get the picture
Oh oh, now you wanna fix her
Oh oh, now you're screaming, "Let's go back"
I ain't having that
But now my love ain't around
It's behind walls that won't come down
But now you wanna show up and turn my sour sweet
You gon' miss me

[Pre-Chorus]
You've watched me fall, now I'm colder than winter
My love you forgot, let me help you remember
I loved you like you never been
So overdosed on your own medicine

[Chorus]
There's no need to call me on the phone
Telling me how much you're alone
Enemy of my state of mind
Now I'm a villain, I'm the villain
I told you that you would need my love
I gave you my all, but that wasn't enough
Enemy of my state of mind
Now I'm a villain, baby, I'm the villain of your love

I'm the villain, I'm the villain of your love

[Intro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
He's all right, he's all wrong
He's a player, he's a dog
He's my friend, he's my foe
I just can't leave him, I can't go
I got my reasons, got my pride
I got these kids, we got these ties
We had this love, I had these dreams
I'm falling apart at the seams

[Pre-Chorus]
He's my man when we're at home
And it can't hurt if I don't know
All his secrets, all his lies
I just keep pushing, out my mind
I wish that everybody would stop judging
Pointing fingers, it's cutting
My heart is broken up, I'm open, and feeling so bad
I've gotta make decisions
I'm strong, but who am I kidding?
I'll be okay, but this love is tearing me in half

[Chorus]
Nobody wants to be the one breaking up
I'm down on my knees, I'm praying for this love
I'm in love (I'm in love), I'm still in love (I'm still in love)
I just don't think (Just don't think), that it's enough (It's enough)
I can feel, it getting colder
I'm afraid, of starting over

[Verse 2]
He makes me feel like a child
He makes me happy when he smiles
He makes me sad, he makes me mad
I wanna give him all I have
And I have tried to treat him good
Show support like I should
Did my part, he's my heart
And I've been faithful from the start

[Pre-Chorus]
He's my man when we're at home
And it can't hurt if I don't know
All his secrets, all his lies
I just keep pushing, out my mind
I wish that everybody would stop judging
Pointing fingers, it's cutting
My heart is broken up, I'm open, and feeling so bad
I've gotta make decisions
I'm strong, but who am I kidding?
I'll be okay, but this love is tearing me in half

[Chorus]
Nobody wants to be the one breaking up
I'm down on my knees, I'm praying for his love
I'm in love (I'm in love), I'm still in love (I'm still in love)
I just don't think (Just don't think), that it's enough (It's enough)
I can feel, it getting colder
I'm afraid, of starting over

[Bridge]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
To save this life, we built together
We need another chance
It's like my whole life, and my existence
He holds in his hands, in his hands

[Chorus]
Nobody wants to be the one breaking up (Oh, yeah)
I'm down on my knees (Down on my knees), I'm praying for his love (For his love, yeah)
I'm in love (I'm in love), I'm still in love (I'm still in love)
I just don't think (Just don't think), that it's enough (It's enough)
I can feel, it getting colder
The time has come, for starting over

[Intro]
I wanna be where you are (Oh, oh)
Could it be I stayed away too long, oh? (Oh)
I wanna be where you are (Oh, oh)
Could it be I stayed away too long, oh?

[Verse 1]
I remember I said we should split
Had a lot going on and you weren't part of it
You trying to reason with me, I admit, but I did
And now I'm walking around so, so sick
And now I'm fiending, for you that's a fact
Got me missing you like L.A. misses Shaq
What I got to do, on my mission to get you back
'Cause I'm just that whack without you, oh baby, baby, I

[Pre-Chorus]
Really didn't mean it when I said it, I'll repeat it
I was tripping, flipping out it was some nonsense (Oh baby, baby, I)
I was on a whole 'nother level, now I got it all together
I was sick, but now I'm better (Oh baby, baby, I)
I was trying to push you away, really wanted you to stay
Didn't know that was the case (Oh baby, baby, I)
It was just plain crazy 'cause 'round here lately
Been thinking 'bout nothing but my baby

[Chorus]
If you're in Houston

[Post-Chorus]
I wanna be where you are (Oh, oh)
Could it be I stayed away too long, oh? (Oh)
I wanna be where you are (Oh, oh)
Could it be I stayed away too long, oh?

[Verse 2]
What's done is done, and I want to take it back
I'm not living in the past, 'cause, but now I want you back
Got to get you, got to get you here
I been looking for you everywhere
Everywhere, baby
I'll apologize 1000 times to you if I could prove, prove
Baby, I'm wrong and out of breath
From being around the world trying to get to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Really didn't mean it when I said it, I'll repeat it
I was tripping, flipping out it was some nonsense (Oh baby, baby, I)
I was on a whole 'nother level, now I got it all together
I was sick, but now I'm better (Oh baby, baby, I)
I was trying to push you away, really wanted you to stay

[Intro: Lil Wayne & Chris Brown]
Young Mula, baby!
Haha, you thought it was over?

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I wasn't born last night
I know these hoes ain't right
But you was blowin' up her phone last night
But she ain't have her ringer nor her ring on last night, ooh
Nigga, that's that nerve
Why give a bitch your heart when she rather have a purse?
Why give a bitch an inch when she rather have nine?
You know how the game goes
She be mine by half time, I'm the shit, ooh
Nigga, that's that nerve
You all about her, and she all about hers
Birdman Junior in this bitch, no flamingos
And I done did everything but trust these hoes
(CB fuck with me!)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
When a rich nigga want you
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya
Oh, these hoes ain't loyal
Woah, these hoes ain't loyal
Yeah, yeah, let me see

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Just got rich
Took a broke nigga's bitch
I can make a broke bitch rich
But I don't fuck with broke bitches
Got a white girl with some fake titties
I took her to the Bay with me
Eyes closed smoking marijuana
Rolling up the Bob Marley, I'm a Rasta
She wanna do drugs (Drugs)
Smoke weed, get drunk (Wasted)
She wanna see a nigga trap
She wanna fuck all the rappers (Let me see)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Uh-huh, when a rich nigga want you (Want you, baby)
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya (Nothing, no)
Oh, these hoes ain't loyal (No, they ain't)
Woah, these hoes ain't loyal
Yeah, yeah, let me see

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Black girl with a big booty
If she a bad bitch, let's get to it, right away
We up in this club
Bring me the bottles

That's a no-no, girl
All this money in the air, I wanna see you dance
Just got rich (Got rich)
Took a broke nigga's bitch (Yeah)
I can make a broke bitch rich
But I don't fuck with broke bitches (Girl, it's you)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Uh-huh, when a rich nigga want you (Yeah, yeah, want you, baby)

Oh, these hoes ain't loyal (Oh-oh-oh no)
Woah, these hoes ain't loyal
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, let me see

[Verse 4: Too Short]
Her nigga fell in love, turned into a woosy
24-7 he was eatin' that pussy (Eatin' that pussy)
But these hoes ain't faithful
A nigga like me will have your bitch on tape though
I been knowin' not to trust these hoes
I get bread, get head, and fuck these hoes
In that order
Don't switch it around
Relationships change, it's so different now (It's so different now)
No high-school sweetheart
These bitches pimpin'
All these opinions
Women on women
Lickin' them titties
Sex in the city
Hella "Instagram likes" but you ain't pretty
Bitch!

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Come on, come on, girl, why you frontin'?
Baby, show me something
When I call her, she gon' leave
And I bet that bottom dollar she gon' cheat
Come on, come on, girl, why you frontin'?
Baby, show me something
You done spent your bread on her

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Uh-huh, when a rich nigga want you (Want you, baby, babe, woo!)

[Verse 1]
Like an angel, out the sky you came
Clearing up all the clouds, the sadness and the rain
So pure and healing was the love you bring
I knew inside it felt so right

[Pre-Chorus]
For me, I've struggled all my life
To find that thing that makes it right
With you, it seems I may have found
Some other kind of love

[Chorus]
I will love you all my life
Always be by your side
And I will give you all I have
'Cause you gave me peace and joy again
Again, again

[Verse 2]
I was scared to let go and trust your love
After what I've been through, I have had enough
Whispering through your eyes, you never said a word
But something said, "You're insane"

[Pre-Chorus]
For me, I've struggled all my life
To find that thing that makes it right
With you, it seems I may have found
Some other kind of love

[Chorus]
I will love you all my life
Always be by your side
And I will give you all I have
'Cause you gave me peace and joy again
Again, again

[Verse 3]
A friend is what you'll always have in me
I'm so grateful for the man you turned out to be
And it doesn't matter who you happen to meet
You'll forever be a sacred part of me

[Chorus]
I will love you all my life
Always be by your side
And I will give you all I have
'Cause you gave me peace and joy again
Again, again

[Verse 1]
Running out of juice
It's a matter of seconds now, I'm shutting down (Oh, woah-oh)
Desperate when I move
My battery is screaming loud, I'm shutting down (Oh, woah-oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
It's an addiction, I, I, I want more, more, more
Give me some boom, boom, boom

Why'd you tell me this?
Were you looking for my reaction?
What do you need to know?
Don't you know I’ll always be your girl?

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't have to prove to me you're beautiful to strangers
I've got loving eyes of my own

[Chorus]
You belong to me
Tell her, tell her you were fooling
You belong to me
You don't even know her
You belong to me
Tell her that I love you
You belong to me

[Intro]
Oh, oh
Love makes no promises

[Verse 1]
If you only knew
What I've been going through
Waiting and wanting you
Could this be love?

[Pre-Chorus]
How, tell me how will I know?
Will my heart make me believe it so?
Or can I trust the way I feel?
If you could read my mind (If you only knew, if you only knew, if you only knew, if you only knew)
You see how hard I have tried (If you only knew, if you only knew)
Still, I can't decide

[Chorus]
If you only knew
What I've been going through
Waiting and wanting you
Could this be love?
Tell me could this be love?
El amor no hace promesas

[Verse 2]
Do you know if it's true?
That real love lasts a lifetime
Does it shine like the stars up in the sky?
And do you know (Do you know) if you can fall for just a moment?
Is a moment for all time?

[Pre-Chorus]
Why, why am I so unsure?
Is that love knocking at my door?
Or the sound of my beating heart?
If you could read my mind (If you only knew, if you only knew, if you only knew, if you only knew)
You know I just can't hide (If you only knew, if you only knew)
What I feel inside

[Chorus]
If you only knew
What I've been going through
Waiting and wanting you
Could this be love?
Oh, tell me could this be love?
Could this be love?

Oh, oh, oh, oh

Love makes no promises
(Baby, if you only knew what I've been going through)

[Verse 1]
Boy, I never knew I could feel
The way I felt, when I felt
The way you were feeling me, baby
I'm so out of control, yeah
Every time you look my way
I realize more and more
How much I adore those pretty eyes of yours
I'm helpless, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
What I want to know is
Are you willing to try?
Can you love me for a lifetime
In just one night? Oh

[Chorus]
Baby, I love you (Love you)
Baby, I need you (Need you)
I gotta have you (I gotta have you, baby)
Can't be without you (Be without you)
Baby, I love you (Yeah, yeah)
Baby, I need you (Need you)
I gotta have you (I gotta have you, baby)
Can't be without you

[Verse 2]
Blessed and cursed on the same day
The day that I first felt the power of you
Inside of me, such a strong feeling
There comes a time in everyone's life
When you know that everyone around you knows
That everything has changed, you're not the same
It's a new day

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, what I want to know is
Are you willing to try?
There's gotta be more meaning to this
Than what meets the eye

[Chorus]
Baby, I love you (Baby, I need you)
Baby, I need you (Gotta have you, baby)
I gotta have you (Can't be without you)
Can't be without you (Baby, I love you)
Baby, I love you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Baby, I need you (I gotta have you)
I gotta have you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can't be without you

[Bridge]
Ooh, I love the way you kiss me
Oh, baby please, I'm about to lose my mind
Oh, talk to me, oh
'Cause I'm begging for you and I'm down on my knees
Baby, I know you're the one that I need
Baby, I love you
You know I need you
Gotta have you
Can't be without you
Baby, I love you
You know I need you
Gotta have you
Can't be without you

Can't be without you, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

[Chorus 1]

And beg bread

[Intro]
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Like a movie scene
In the sweetest dreams
I have pictured us together
Now to feel your lips
On my fingertips
I have to say is even better
Than I ever thought it could possibly be
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
From all of my sadness, the tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life

[Chorus]
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Tender words you say
Take my breath away
Love me now and leave me never
Found a sacred place
Lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever
I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

[Chorus]
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 3]
Gone are the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

[Chorus]
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long (Oh, oh)
Waiting for tonight, oh (Tonight, tonight)
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh (Tonight, tonight)
I've dreamed of this love for so long (Oh)
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh (Tonight, tonight)
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight, oh

[Verse 1]
Strangers always got some mess to spread
But I have learned to flick them off (Them off)
Can't walk a mile in my YSLs
I strap 'em on and I walk it off (It off)

[Pre-Chorus]
Got 'em saying, "I can't believe she did it
No, she didn't"
My "wow" factor's got 'em crazy (Crazy)
Got 'em saying, "Yeah, she did it
But I can't believe it"
Never say you can't believe (Haha, haha, haha)

[Chorus]
Even if they try
They still can't walk a mile in these shoes
They couldn't even lace 'em up right
Honey, these pumps are too big to fill
Ten million men can't walk a mile in these shoes

[Verse 2]
My strut's so fierce
Steven's got 'em mad at me
Laugh and talk behind my back
But they'll never get the best of me
I see 'em doing my dance
And I hear 'em singing my song
I'm surpassing the rest
'Cause that's how I was raised to do it

[Pre-Chorus]
Got 'em saying, "I can't believe she did it
No, she didn't"
My "wow" factor's got 'em crazy (Crazy)
Got 'em saying, "Yeah, she did it
But I can't believe it"
Never say you can't believe (Haha, haha, haha)

[Chorus]
Even if they try
They still can't walk a mile in these shoes
They couldn't even lace 'em up right
Honey, these pumps are too big to fill
Ten million men can't walk a mile in these shoes
Even if they try
They still can't walk a mile in these shoes
They couldn't even lace 'em up right
Honey, these pumps are too big to fill
Ten million men can't walk a mile in these shoes

[Bridge]
I'm walking tall
I don't let their hatred test me
They bite the dust, head above water
They still can't breathe
My feet pound the ground as I stomp it out
I dare you to walk a mile in my shoes (Haha, haha, haha)

[Chorus]
Even if they try
They still can't walk a mile in these shoes
They couldn't even lace 'em up right
Honey, these pumps are too big to fill
Ten million men can't walk a mile in these shoes

[Intro]
Hahaha
Ooh, haha

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I know it's on your heart
That a love like ours shall never fall apart
You're so afraid of the rain
So I will take your hand
And I'll love you in the best way that I can
And I only expect the same

[Chorus]
Don't promise me forever
Don't promise me the sun and sky
Don't pretend to know you'll never make me cry
Just hold me now and promise me you'll try
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Though I am sure of what I feel
I never thought a love so true felt so unreal
And I'm a little afraid myself
But if you love me day by day
With an honest heart and just a little faith
Baby, time will tell the tale

[Chorus]
Don't promise me forever
Don't promise me the sun and sky
Don't pretend to know you'll never make me cry
Just hold me now and promise me you'll try
Just hold me now and promise me you'll try

[Bridge]
Oh, oh
Mmm

[Chorus]
Don't promise me forever
Don't you promise me the sun and the sky
Don't pretend to know you'll never make me cry
Just hold me now and promise me you'll try, ooh
Just hold me now and promise me you'll try
Oh, oh

[Intro]
I just wanna be
I just wanna be

[Verse 1]
Taking away the fact that I care about you, it's just your way
So sweet, everything seems right around you
Did you know that you had this calming way about you when you touch?
And I wanna know if I could be your girl

[Chorus]
You are everything and everything is you (Your girl)
You are everything and everything is you (Your girl)
You are everything and everything is you (Your girl)
You are everything and everything is you

[Verse 2]
I'm happy to say in a lot of ways you've changed me
Makes me smile when you said you were glad the day you found me
I'm wishing away any harm that might ever find you
Heaven knows, I really feel I'll always be your girl

[Chorus]
You are everything and everything is you (Your girl)
You are everything and everything is you (Your girl)
You are everything and everything is you (Your girl)
You are everything and everything is you (Your girl)

[Verse 3]
The one who puts her arms around you
The one who lays her head beside you (Your girl)
The one who listens when you need it
When no one else sees, I can see it (I just wanna be your girl)
The one who knows when something's wrong
The one who knows your favorite song (I just wanna be your girl)
The one who all your family loves
The one you place no one above (Your girl)

[Chorus]
You are everything and everything is you (Your girl)
You are everything and everything is you (Your girl)
You are everything and everything is you (Your girl)
You are everything and everything is you (I'll always be your girl)

[Bridge]
The one who's true to you and down for you
The one who makes you smile and laughs with you
The one who holds you down, I'm there for you
The one, the one, the one (Your girl)
The one who's true to you and down for you
The one who makes you smile and laughs with you (Your girl)
The one who holds you down, I'm there for you
The one, the one, the one
The one who's true to you
The one who makes you smile (Need to be your girl)
The one who holds you down
The one, the one, the one (Your girl)
The one who's true to you
The one who makes you smile (Your girl)
The one who holds you down
The one, the one, the one

[Outro]
I can be anything you need

[Intro]
Na na na na na
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
It's not that serious
I never put that much thought into us
It wasn't that I loved you, I was curious
Who did you think that you were involved with?
Now, baby, you should know it's not that serious

[Verse 1]
How could you tell me that you love me
When I knew you were just tryna play me?
But you're the fool because I know how to switch the game up on you
And in the end, I know who will lose

[Pre-Chorus]
I played this game before (Game before)
And I can't play no more (Play no more)
What do you take me for? (Take me for)
It's not what you thought (What you thought)
So don't play games with me (Games with me)
'Cause I came to teach (I came to teach)
And if you want to cheat (Want to cheat)
It won't be with me (Be with me)

[Chorus]
It's not that serious (Oh)
I never put that much thought into us (To us)
It wasn't that I loved you, I was curious (Curious)
Who did you think that you were involved with?
Now, baby, you should know it's not that serious

[Verse 2]
It should concern you that I'm always one step ahead of you
So that should let you know that what you do
I have done before, it's nothing new
So run those games on someone who can't be fooled

[Pre-Chorus]
I can almost see (Almost see)
Lies coming through your teeth (Through your teeth)
In every word you speak (Word you speak)
You make it clear to me (Clear to me)
That you're playing wrong (Playing wrong)
And your game ain't strong (Game ain't strong)
I've been in this too long (This too long)
So just be moving on (Moving on)

[Chorus]
It's not that serious (Oh, ooh)
I never put that much thought into us (I never did, I never did)
It wasn't that I loved you, I was curious (I was so curious)
Who did you think that you were involved with? (Who did you think?)
Now, baby, you should know
It's not that serious (Oh)
I never put that much thought into us (Yeah)
It wasn't that I loved you, I was curious
Who did you think that you were involved with? (That you were)
Now, baby, you should know it's not that serious

[Bridge]
Tu me haces reir todas las veces que
Tu creias que yo no sabia que
Tu estabas haciendo
Tu sabes que yo ha sido todo eso antes
Al final tu eres el perdia
No jueges conmigo
Don't play games with my heart
(Don't play games with my, my heart)
I will let you go before you start
(I will let you go before you start)

[Chorus]
It's not that serious (Baby)
I never put that much thought into us (To us)
It wasn't that I loved you, I was curious (I was curious)
Who did you think that you were involved with? (Yeah)
Now, baby, you should know
It's not that serious (It's never been)
I never put that much thought into us (No, no, no)
It wasn't that I loved you, I was curious (Yes, I was)
Who did you think that you were involved with? (That you were)
Now, baby, you should know it's not that serious

[Verse 1]
I saw you and fell in love
You saw me and fell in love too
You and me, we fell in love with each other last night
I told you I was concerned
You told me of your concerns too
Yet and still we both decided to make love last night
Baby, please tell me

[Chorus]
Where do we go from here, my love?
What are we doing, baby?
Boy, you gotta let me know
Why can't we live the way we want?
I want the world to know
I just gotta let it show
What do we stand to lose
If being together is what we choose?
Oh, my love
I think that we should talk about us

[Verse 2]
Could this be a crazy dream?
And if so, then you're dreaming too (You're dreaming too)
'Cause I know for sure that you feel the same as I do
(I know that you feel the same as I do)
You feel the same
Could it be that we could be wrong (We could be wrong)
Even though we're feeling so right? (Feeling so right?)
I don't care because I know that I want you tonight
And I know you want me too

[Chorus]
Where do we go from here, my love?
What are we doing, baby?
Boy, you gotta let me know
Why can't we live the way we want?
I want the world to know
I just gotta let it show
What do we stand to lose
If being together is what we choose?
Oh, my love
I think that we should talk

[Bridge]
You see all my life I've waited
Waited all my life
Just to be with someone like you

[Chorus]
Where do we go from here, my love?
Where are we going, baby?
I wanna know
Why can't we live the way we want?
I want the world to know
I just gotta let it show
What do we stand to lose
If being together is what we choose?
Oh, my love
I think that we should talk about us

[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

[Verse 1]
It always feels like a love to me in the beginning
My mind is just a mirror of the way my heart wants it to be
I hope to see everything in his eyes
'Cause that's where it starts with the truth and the lies
And I cannot hide my emotions
You cannot hide your intentions from me

[Chorus]
Don't you think, what I'm saying is
It's just the way it is, it's just the way it is?
Not everything is what you say it is
That's just the way it is, the way it is, the way it is

[Verse 2]
And everything you do to me, it'll be done to you
And everything I put you through, well then, I'll go through
But I'm willing to take that chance (Take that chance)
For this type of romance
Its special, baby (Uh)
I always look for love to be, so exciting
But you can't force it, I'm finding
In reality, chemistry is everything

[Chorus]
Don't you think, what I'm saying is
It's just the way it is, it's just the way it is?
Not everything is what you say it is
That's just the way it is, the way it is, the way it is
Don't you think, what I'm saying is
It's just the way it is, it's just the way it is?
Not everything is what you say it is
That's just the way it is, the way it is, the way it is

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah
What your perception is
Of our connection is simply perfection
And it's the same thing
If you're accepting it, then I'm accepting it
Simple perfection, and its just the same thing
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh

[Chorus]
Don't you think, what I'm saying is
It's just the way it is, it's just the way it is?
Not everything is what you say it is
That's just the way it is, the way it is, the way it is
Don't you think, what I'm saying is
It's just the way it is, it's just the way it is?
Not everything is what you say it is
That's just the way it is, the way it is, the way it is
Don't you think, what I'm saying is (The way it is, what you're saying is)
It's just the way it is, it's just the way it is?
Not everything is what you say it is (It's just the way it is, what you say it is)
That's just the way it is, the way it is, the way it is
Don't you think, what I'm saying is
It's just the way it is, it's just the way it is?
Not everything is what you say it is
That's just the way it is, the way it is, the way it is

[Verse 1]
Time goes slowly now in my life
Fear no more of what I'm not sure

[Pre-Chorus]
Searching to feel your soul
The strength to stand alone
The power of not knowing and letting go

[Chorus]
I guess I've found my way
It's simple when it's right
Feeling lucky just to be here, tonight
And happy just to be me
And be alive

[Verse 2]
Love in and out of my, my heart
And though life can be strange, I can't be afraid
Searching to feel your soul

[Pre-Chorus]
The strength to stand alone
The power of not knowing and letting go

[Chorus]
I guess I've found my way
It's simple when it's right
Feeling lucky just to be here, tonight
And happy just to be me
And be alive

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
I guess I've found my way
It's simple when it's right
Feeling lucky just to be here, tonight
And happy just to be me
And be alive, hmm

Come on, baby, me and you

[Chorus]
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life's been showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?
Do you gain what you're hoping for?
When you look behind you, there's no open door
What are you hoping for?
Do you know?

[Verse 1]
Once we were standing still in time
Chasing the fantasies that filled our mind
You knew how I loved you, but my spirit was free
Laughing at the questions that you once asked of me

[Chorus]
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life's been showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?

[Verse 2]
Now looking back on all we planned
We let so many dreams just slip through our hands
Why must we wait so long before we see
How sad the answers to our those questions can be?

[Chorus]
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life's been showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?
Do you gain what you're hoping for?
When you look behind you, there's no open door
What are you hoping for?
Do you know?

[Outro]
Do you know?

[Verse 1]
Everywhere I plant my feet
Everybody know 'bout me, nigga
I ain't gotta say one word
I-I ain't gotta show ID, nigga
Back when I was in 10th grade
I saved up, got a set of gold teeth
And I took 'em out, but 7 years later, I got seven sets of gold teeth, nigga
I'm Bobby Bands; I do that
Private jew; I flew that
40k; I threw that
A quarter pound; I blew that
It sounds crazy, but it ain't nothin' to it
She's a freak, but I already knew it
She looked at me and said, "I'm your biggest fan"
I told her, "if it's real, then tattoo it"
Every day, I wake up, smoking like Jamaicans
Like an occupation, this is so outrageous
Head so good I'm making Bill Cosby faces
Dip in that pudding, like vanilla wafers
Feet on the carpet, then to the office
Then to the closet, many different flavors
Someone tell my lawyer call the label
And tell them hurry up with the paper, ha!

[Hook]
Eastside gon' back me up

You niggas trying to act like Bob ain't dope, nigga, stop that shit
That's $50,000 Alpaca; you gotta blot that shit, fool
Look at this resume; can't nobody top that shit
And unless you the girl I'm fucking
Then you don't really need to be on Bob dick
Like that, mmm, like that, huh
Take a second, let me get it right back, huh
They was hoping that I'd probably fall off, right?
But all that fell was them haters on my back, yeah
I-I-I ain't even got No Genre, but this ganja give contact, yeah
Well, how the hell they gon' call this the "rap game" when most of y'all niggas can't rap?
Most of y'all niggas so whack
Most of y'all ain't got--mo-most of y'all ain't got no swag
Most of y'all bap, most of y'all niggas so flawed
And all real niggas know that
'Cause see this is not necessarily based on dexterity
'Cause the things they're tellin' me is I'm good as I'll ever be
I'm good as I'll ever be
In the hood I'm incredibly understood 'cause it's definitely in my blood, I'm a pedigree, nigga
Wow!

[Verse 1]
Looking through a coffee table book
At a small cafe on Broadway
Trying to find a way out of all trouble and dismay
Traveling on a road unpaved
Everywhere I look there's something there to remind me
Of feelings from yesterday
Listening to drama and hearsay only leaves me empty

[Pre-Chorus]
(But when I think of you)
You are my friend first
We talk about what hurts
We talk about love
Let's talk about us
Can't you see I want you to be mine?
What matters the most
I just want to see you up close
When I look into your heart
You got everything I want
Can't you see I want you to be mine?

[Chorus]
You do what hasn't been done before
No one loves you more than me
Can't you see I want you to be mine?
You do what hasn't been done before
No one loves you more than me
Can't you see I want you to be mine?
I want you to be mine

[Verse 2]
Turn the music up, riding on the highway
Thinking about the way that I feel when I'm with you
A feeling that continues to make me feel good
Even when I'm not near you, and I want it to stay
Emotions, I have so many
Love can give you plenty, but I know

[Pre-Chorus]
You are my friend first
We talk about what hurts
We talk about love
Let's talk about us
Can't you see I want you to be mine? (Can't you see?)
What matters the most
I just want to see you up close
When I look into your heart (Look into your heart)
You got everything I want
Can't you see I want you to be mine?

[Chorus]
You do what hasn't been done before (Done before)
No one loves you more than me
Can't you see I want you to be mine?
You do what hasn't been done before (Before)
No one loves you more than me
Can't you see I want you to be mine?

[Bridge]
Everything he does, all of the above
Didn't know until I fell in love (Until I fell in love)
Fits me like a glove, do you know?
Can't you see I want you to be mine? (I want you to be mine)
Everything he does, fits me like a glove
Didn't know until I fell in love (Until I fell in love)
All of the above, do you know?
Can't you see I want you to be mine?

[Chorus]
You do what hasn't been done before (Hasn't been done before)
No one loves you more than me
Can't you see I want you to be mine?
You do what hasn't been done before (No)
No one loves you more than me (More than me)
Can't you see I want you to be mine?

[Outro]
Be mine, be mine, be mine, be mine
Be mine, be mine, be mine, be mine
Be mine, be mine, be mine

[Intro]
Mafia

[Chorus]
You don't know what you're doing
What you're doing to me
Try to stop it, can't stop it
'Cause you got what I need
You got me all open, and I ain't trying to leave
Hold it, don't drop it, don't drop it
Stop it, can't stop it, won't stop it

[Verse 1]
Every time I try to run something keeps stopping me
(Oh, keeps stopping me)
I try my best to turn around
But your touch won't let me leave

Ah, uh, I can't control it
You put something inside of me, ooh, ooh

Boy, you must have poisoned me, oh-oh

You don't know what you're doing
What you're doing to me
Try to stop it, can't stop it

Stop it, can't stop it, won't stop it

[Verse 2]
Boy, I must be buggin'
Let you play those games I don't understand
(Oh, I can't understand)
I'll be that yo-yo on a string
Goin' down, I come right back to your hands
(Uh, uh, that's right, uh)
Ah, I make excuses, but we keep on rocking anyway, ooh, ooh
Ah, but it ain't working
When I let you go, you make me stay

[Chorus]
You don't know what you're doing (Oh-oh)
What you're doing to me (Hey, yeah)
Try to stop it, can't stop it
'Cause you got what I need (Oh-oh)

Stop it, can't stop it, won't stop it

[Chorus]
You don't know what you're doing
What you're doing to me
Try to stop it, can't stop it

[Verse 1]
Hear the children crying
But I know they cry not in vain
Now the times are changing
Love has come to bloom again
Smelling the air when spring comes by raindrops
Reminds us of youthful days
But now it's not rain that water the cane crops
But the sweat from man's brow
The substance from our spine
We got to keep on living, living on borrowed time

[Chorus]
Hallelujah time
Yes, you can hear the children singing
Hallelujah time
As they go singing by and by
Hallelujah time
Oh, "hallelujah" singing in the morning
Hallelujah time
Let them sing, don't let them cry

[Verse 2]
Over rocks and mountains
The sheep are scattered all around
Over hills and valleys
They are everywhere to be found
But though we bear our burdens now
All afflictions got to end somehow
From swinging the hammer, pulling the plough
Why won't you let us be, to live in harmony
We like to be free like birds in a tree

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Why boasteth thyself
Oh, he-vil man
Playing smart
And not being clever, oh, no
I said you're working iniquity
To achieve vanity, yeah, if a-so a-so
But the goodness of Jah-Jah
I-dureth for-i-ver

[Chorus]
If you are the big tree
We are the small axe
Sharpened to cut you down (Well sharp)
Ready to cut you down, oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
These are the words
Of my master, keep on telling me, oh
No weak heart shall prosper, oh, no, they can't, eh, eh

[Refrain]
Whosoever diggeth a pit, Lord
Shall fall in it, shall fall in it
Whosoever diggeth a pit
Shall bury in it, shall bury in it

[Chorus]
If you are the big tree
We are the small axe
Sharpened to cut you down
Ready to cut you down

[Refrain]
Eh, whosoever diggeth a pit
Shall fall in it, fall in it, eh
Whosoever diggeth a pit
Shall bury in it, shall bury in it

[Chorus]
If you have a big tree
We have a small axe
Ready to cut you down (Well sharp)
Sharpened to cut you down, oh

[Outro]
If you are the big tree, let me tell you this
We are the small axe
Ready to cut you down (Well sharp)
Sharpened to cut you down
If you are the big tree
We are the small axe

[Verse 1]
What your hands do
It is your own eyes that have seen
So won't you judge your actions
To make sure the results are clean
It's your own conscience
That is going to remind you
That it's your heart and nobody else's
That is going to judge

[Chorus]
Be not selfish in your doings
Pass it on
Help your brothers in their needs
Pass it on
Live for yourself and you will live in vain
Live for others, you will live again
In the kingdom of Jah men shall reign
Pass it on

[Verse 2]
What's in the darkness
Must be revealed to light
We are not here to judge what is good from bad
But to do the things that are right
On a hot, sunny day
Follow the shadows for rescue
But as the day grows old
I know the sun is gonna find you

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
Yes, me friend
We de a street again
Yes, me friend, me good friend
Them say we free again

[Verse 1]
The bars could not hold me
Force could not control me, now
They try to keep me down
But Jah put I around
Yes, I've been accused, many a times
And wrongly abused now
But through the powers of the Most High
They've got to turn me loose

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't try to cold me up on this bridge, now
I've got to reach Mount Zion
The highest region
If you a bull-bucker
Let me tell you this
I'm a duppy conqueror, conqueror

[Chorus]
Yes, me friend, me good friend
We de a street again
Yes, me friend, me good friend
Them say we free again

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't try to cold me up on this bridge, now
I've got to reach Mount Zion
The highest region
So if you a bull-bucker
Let me tell you this
I'm a duppy conqueror, conqueror

[Chorus]
Yes, me friend
Them say we're free again
Yes, me friend, me good friend
Them set  de a street again

[Intro]
Got to build our love on one foundation

There will never be no love at all
There will never be no love at all
Got to put aside them segregation

Got to put aside them denomination
There will never be no love at all

We got to come together
Because we are birds of a feather
Got to come together

Or there will never be no love at all
There will never, never, never be no love at all

[Outro]
Got to build our love on one foundation

[Intro]
Woah, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Guess I should've shut my mouth
But I had to get it out
So much for being headstrong
Now I'm going halfway out my mind
I know I was out of line
No scratch that, I was dead wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
Know I shoulda let it go
But I just had to be right
Ooh, coulda left it alone
But, no, I had to be right
Swear I woulda just fell back
If I knew all I'd be left with is these shoulda, coulda, wouldas 'Cause you're gone

[Chorus]
Now I'm out here tripping
'Cause you came up missing
And my head keeps spinning
It's getting out of control
I'm backing down this time, I don't wanna fight
I don't care who's right
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone (Yeah)
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone (Yeah)
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone

[Verse 2]
Heaven knows if you were here
I'd be all up in your ear
Least you could do is answer your phone
'Cause I realized my mistake
And baby, I'll do what it takes
If I could just get you one and one

[Pre-Chorus]
Shoulda let it go
But I just had to be right
Ooh, coulda left it alone
But, no, I had to be right
Swear I woulda just fell back
If I knew all I'd be left with is these shoulda, coulda, wouldas 'Cause you're gone

[Chorus]
Now I'm out here tripping
'Cause you came up missing
And my head keeps spinning
It's getting out of control
I'm backing down this time, I don't wanna fight
I don't care who's right
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone (Yeah)
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone (Yeah)
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone

[Bridge]
I know I pushed you out
Running off at the mouth
Saying all the wrong things
Calling you out your name
I was unpredictable
I was so emotional
But I swear I'm gonna do better (Yeah)
Can we get this back together again?

[Chorus]
Now I'm out here tripping
'Cause you came up missing
And my head keeps spinning (Ooh, oh)
It's getting out of control (Out of control)
I'm backing down this time, I don't wanna fight (I don't wanna fight)
I don't care who's right (I don't care who's right)
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone
Now I'm out here tripping
'Cause you came up missing
And my head keeps spinning
It's getting out of control
I'm backing down this time (Backing down), I don't wanna fight (I don't wanna fight)
I don't care who's right
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone
I'm wrong when you're gone (Yeah)
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone
So wrong when you're gone (Yeah)
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm wrong when you're gone
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone (Hear me)
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone

So wrong, hear me
Come back, it seems so long

[Verse 1]
Love has done a number on my mind
Though I sit and wonder, I don't ask why
Some decisions I've made haven't altogether been mine
Now I don't feel a thing, I feel more pain

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I'm not bitter, I'm not cold
I'm just frozen for a moment
My vision is impaired
My heart is under repair

[Chorus]
What can I say about love?
I know what it means to have too little and too much
Crowding my thoughts
What I really want is to not think about it at all
Not think about it at all

[Verse 2]
Life is never easy when you need it to be
Desire can deceive you, it's better to daydream
Somewhere deep down inside, I knew it wasn't the right thing
But I didn't want to be wrong, that's a chance you take

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I'm not bitter, I'm not cold
I'm just frozen for a moment
My vision is impaired
My heart is under repair

[Chorus]
What can I say about love?
I know what it means to have too little and too much
Crowding my thoughts
What I really want is to not think about it at all
What can I say about love?
I know what it means to have too little and too much
Crowding my thoughts
What I really want is to not think about it at all

[Bridge]
I'm just frozen for a moment
Oh

[Chorus]
What can I say about love? (What can I say?)
I know what it means to have too little and too much (About love)
Crowding my thoughts (Oh, woah)
What I really want is to not think about it at all (Don't think about it)
What can I say about love? (Oh, woah, yeah)
I know what it means to have too little and too much (Ooh)

[Verse 1]
Oh baby, the room stars spinning

Every single time you step on me
Oh baby, it's beyond butterflies now
It's more like I'm mesmerized now
Can't stay relaxed when you look in my eyes
Ain't even got to whisper

Come and catch me, before I am down

What you do to me when you're around
Don't got to whisper
And my knees get weak
Don't let me see you coming
I'll forget how to speak
And baby, when you're near me
I can't even think
It's like I, oh I, think I...

[Chorus]
I'm about to ooh ooh ooh ooh faint, baby
When I fall, when I see you, can't stand up straight
When I touch you, ohh baby ooh ooh ooh ooooh faint, baby

[Bridge]
Grab a pillow, beause I'm about to fall hard
So good, that baby, you catch me off my guard
I don't hurt myself if I ever hit the ground
Come catch me
Because you got me falling out

[Chorus]
Ooh ooh ooh ooh faint, baby
When I fall, when I see you, can't stand up straight
When I touch you, ohh baby ooh ooh ooh ooooh faint, baby

It's just what I feel so I'm gonna keep on, keep on, singing your praises in everyway I can think of
And this is what I mean love

[Chorus]
When I see you baby, I see my better ha-a-alf
When I see you baby, I just gotta tip my ha-a-at
'Cause when I see you baby, I'm seeing the flyest, the freshest, the finest, the best
You're the highest, you're the greatest part of me
And darling, you are fi-i-ine
When I see you baby, I just can't believe you're mi-i-ine
'Cause when I see you baby, I'm seeing the flyest, the freshest, the finest, the best
You're the highest, the greatest part of me

[Verse 2]
I said you're the shhh and here's my proclamation
My way of saying thank you for your dedication
Now I can spend the rest of my life sitting high up on cloud nine
And all because I know I'm your lady
And no, don't nothing get better than this, we steady stacking chips together
Coping gifts and taking trips and spend it on each other
No other can do-do what you do, 'cause baby you're the truth and that's why I gotta tell you that...

[Chorus]
When I see you baby, I see my better ha-a-alf

[Intro]
Thank you for all being here on a Friday, I know there's lots of places you can be on a Friday, so I appreciate you taking the time
to be with me, it does truly mean a lot
I would like to, erm, do a, uh, love poem right now, since it's sort of early in the show, um
I warn you, it is sappy and romantic so, um, I'll get it out of the way now and then I'll go back to the, uh, the dirty stuff that everyone loves or whatever
Um, okay, it's called "I Fuck Sluts"

[Verse 1]
Sluts! Sluts! (It's not a role call, but thank you)
Sluts, I fuck sluts
Sluts get fucked when I fuck sluts
No ifs and’s, or buts. I fuck sluts
I fuck sluts
Nice girls are nice but no good for nut-sucking
They'll need a serene night to green-light a butt fucking
But that'll be easy with sleazy old slut fucking
Boo to the nice girls. Praise be to slut fucking!

[Verse 2]
I have a list. A list?
Yes, a list of all the sluts I've missed
I've never fucked or sucked these sluts
And thus my nuts are fucking pissed
So, when I fuck the lucky slut my nut removes her from the list
Another dumb cum-bucket struck from my nut sucking
Suck it slut, slut fucking bucket-list

[Interlude 1]
Yes, you hear the influences, Chaucer-- The pages are blank, I know it. Why am I lying to you?

[Verse 3]
Sluts can be white, black, brown, pink, or almond
They can be skinny with big tits, or be skinny with small ones
Sluts can be perky, preppy or posh
With their brains and their clothes all shrunk from the wash

[Interlude 2]
CD people are confused

[Verse 4]
But other sluts are pretty and funny and smart
These sluts can lift all your thoughts from your dick to your heart
They can talk about science, music, or art
They can put you together or they can pull you apart
But don't trust these sluts, don't, don't you dare
They'll force you to trust them and love them and care
And then they'll be gone and then you'll be aware
Of that hole in your heart that that dumb slut left there

[Skit]
Thank you very much.
So, you see, he was lashing out with sexist language because he had his heart broken. We all learned something
Um, I know that that bit in particular was a little bit dense, a little bit hard to follow, and I want to be able to do something that's easier to follow, and you can probably get it in the first listen, so I want to do a slower joke for you
Here's a slow joke:
(In slow-motion)
What did the ear of corn say when its clothes fell off?
"Aw, shucks!"
Get it?
Like "shucks" as in shucking corn and also "shucks" the exclamation?
Am I right?

[Normal speed]
Something for everybody
Um, my father recently told me that I act too gay on stage, and I said, "Really dad? Prove it!"

[Throws confetti]
For those of you listening, I threw confetti, flamboyantly

[Outro]
He said, "What about that joke where you throw confetti at the end of it?"
I said, "I haven't written that joke yet, cause it's based off of this conversation! Gotcha!"

[Intro]
Uh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
This is where my story begins
Standing here with you, I'm about to give in
And I'ma give all I can give
Even though in previous relationships
I might have been mischievous
I wasn't always ready, I admit to this
But what a good feeling it is
I've had a lot of crushes, close to nothing like this (Yeah, uh)

[Pre-Chorus]
And every time the subject would come up (Yeah, yeah)
I made up every excuse that I could think of (Oh, yeah)
I used to run but now I'm getting warmed up
In a few words, this feeling, I could sum up

[Chorus]
I need love
For the first time in my life, I need love
Ain't no love up in the club, I need love
Wanna cuddle up to someone
That make me feel like I'm something
Getting sick and tired of fronting
I need love
For the first time in my life, I need love
Ain't no love up in the club, I need love
I wanna cuddle up to someone
That make me feel like I'm something
Getting sick and tired of fronting, I need

[Verse 2]
I was hanging out with my friends
Seven nights a week, if there's a party, I'm in
But I started getting sick of it
And when I looked back, I didn't know what it meant (What it meant)
I guess I wasn't interested in finding something real
Though I was looking for it (Looking for it)
You should've been looking for me
But you opened up my eyes, and now I can see

[Pre-Chorus]
And every time the subject would come up (Oh)
When they say "I love you," then I only dumb up
A lot of guys wouldn't put up, girl, or shut up (Oh)
But you're the only one who told me your love was endless
A lot of words with feeling cannot sum up
First I had to figure out who I was (Oh)
To try and understand there ain't no shortcuts
Now the only thing that's missing is your love

[Chorus]
I need love
For the first time in my life, I need love
Ain't no love up in the club, I need love
Wanna cuddle up to someone
That make me feel like I'm something
Getting sick and tired of fronting
I need love
For the first time in my life, I need love
Ain't no love up in the club, I need love
I wanna cuddle up to someone
That make me feel like I'm something
Getting sick and tired of fronting, I need

[Bridge]
Slow dance, hold hands, all I want is romance
If it's real, let me know it's real, baby, take a chance
'Cause I been looking for a man who could understand me
And I got a lot of love to give, baby, don't you hear me? (Love)
Slow dance, hold hands, all I want is romance (Love)
If it's real, let me know it's real, baby, take a chance (Love)
'Cause I been looking for a man who could understand me
And I got a lot of love to give, baby, don't you hear me? (Love)

[Chorus]
Slow dance (Love), hold hands
For the first time in my life, I need love
If it's real, let me know it's real
All I need, love
'Cause I been looking for a man
Wanna cuddle up to someone
That make me feel like I'm something
Getting sick and tired of fronting
I need love
Slow dance, hold hands
For the first time in my life, I need love
If it's real, let me know it's real
Wanna feel, I wanna feel, I need love
I wanna cuddle up to someone
That make me feel like I'm something
Getting sick and tired of fronting
I need love
Slow dance, hold hands
For the first time in my life, I need love
If it's real, let me know it's real
Ain't no love up in the club, I need love
I wanna cuddle up to someone
That make me feel like I'm something
Getting sick and tired of fronting
I need love

[Outro]
Slow dance, hold hands, all I want is romance (Love)
If it's real, let me know it's real, baby, take a chance (Yeah, love)
'Cause I been looking for a man who could understand me
And I got a lot of love to give, baby, don't you hear me? (Love)

[Chorus]

Men see their dreams and aspiration-a
Crumble in front of their face
And all of their wicked intention
To destroy the human race

With music, make we chant down Babylon
This music, make we chant down Babylon
This music, come we chant down Babylon

Me say, Music you're - music you're the key
Talk to who? Please talk to me
Bring the voice of - of the Rastaman
Communicating to – ‘cating to everyone

How I (know) - how I know, how I (know) - how I know
And that's how I know
A Reggae Music, chant down - chant down - chant down Babylon
Chant down Babylon, chant down Babylon
Chant down Babylon!
Reggae Music, chant down Babylon!
Reggae Music, chant down Babylon!
Reggae Music, chant down Babylon!
Reggae Music! (chant down Babylon)

To separate I and I from the law of our father
Look at that
You see, blood is thicker than water
Look at that

[Bridge]
Some are leaves
While some are branches
But remember I and I are the roots
Some are dry wood

Got to survive
In iration

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]
They don't want to see us unite
All they want us to do is keep on fussing and fighting
They don't want to see us live together
All they want us to do is keep on killing one another

Dready got a job to do
And he's got to fulfill that mission
To see his hurt is their greatest ambition
But we will survive in this world of competition
Because no matter what they do

And no matter what they say
Natty do them every day
Natty Dread rides again
Through the mystics of tomorrow
Natty Dread rides again
Have no fear, have no sorrow

[Verse 2]
All and all you see a-gwan
Is to fight against Rastaman
So they build their world on great confusion
To force on us the devil's illusion
But the stone that the builder refuse
Shall be the head cornerstone
And no matter what game they play
We got something they could never take away
We got something they could never take away

[Verse 3]
And it's the fire, it's the fire
That's burning down everything
Feel the fire, fire
Only the birds have their wings

Jah say this judgement - it could never be with water
No water can put out this fire
This fire, this fire, this fire
A yaga y'all! Ride, Natty, ride
Go there, Dready, go there
Because now the fire is out of control
Panic in the city, wicked weeping for their gold
Everywhere this fire is burning
Destroying and melting their gold
Destroying and wasting their souls

Ride, Natty, ride
Go there, Dready, go there

[Verse 4]
Tell you what: now the people gather on the beach
And the leader try to make a speech
But the Dreadies understanding that it's too late
Fire is burning
Man, pull your own weight
Fire is burning
Man, pull your own weight
Natty Dread rides again
And me saying Go there, Dready
Oh ride, Natty, ride
And go there, Dready
Riding through the storm
Riding through the calm

[Outro]
Oh ride, Natty, ride
Go there, Dready, go there

[Verse 1]
We refuse to be
What you wanted us to be
We are what we are
That's the way (way) it's going to be, if you don't know
You can't educate us
For no equal opportunity
(Talking about my freedom) Talking about my freedom
People freedom (freedom) and liberty

[Chorus]
Yeah, we've been trodding on the winepress much too long

And if somehow you knew that your love would be untrue (Oh, oh)
Would you lie to me and call me "baby"? (Don't lie to me, call me "baby," I like that)
If you had my love, and I gave you all my trust (Had my love, gave my trust)
Would you comfort me? What would you do if I gave it to you? (You like that?)

Shut up! Open the gate, and let the saints through

Please make it a session (session)
Not another version (version)
Ooh, please make it a session (session)
Not another version (version)!

Hey, you been talking all your mouth full of lies
Sitting there toppling and, Lord, they criticize
So through the eyes of the fool the deaf is wise
And through the eyes of the wise the fool is size

Saying is too much mix up - mix up!
Saying is too much mix up - mix up!

[Verse 5]
I want to clear the wheel once and for all
I want to clear my wheels, I don't care who fall!

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Think you gotta keep me iced? You don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash? I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz? I don't
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez]
When you rolled up in the Escalade
Saw that dub you gave to the valet
Knew that it was game when you looked at me
Pullin' up your sleeve so I could see the Rollie bling
Saw you later in the corner booth
Raisin' up a toast, so I would notice you
But your heart's a mess, think you oughta know
Doesn't matter if you're ballin' out of control

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
All that matters is
That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy, yeah

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]

Think I'm gonna spend your cash? I won't
Even if you were broke

If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
When I took a chance thought you'd understand (You don't understand)
Baby, credit cards aren't romance
So you're tryna to buy what's already yours
What I need from you is not available in stores
Seen a side of you (You) that I really feel (Feel)
Doing way too much (Much), never keep it real (Real)
If it doesn't change, gotta hit the road
Now I'm leavin', where's my keys? I've got to go

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
All that matters is
That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy, yeah

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]

[Interlude: Jennifer Lopez]
Love don't cost a thing, a thing, a thing
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
Yeah, uh, money can't buy love
Well love can't buy a damn thing
See if love buy you champagne
See if the heart buys her ten rings (What?)
Or that Dolce dress with the split up the hamstring
I ain't tryna buy your heart with money
What I'm eatin' now, how I'm gon' starve my honey?
If I went broke today, I'd be back at the block
Catch a case just to keep your face between rocks
Uh, even if we have to live in a box
I'll make the sacrifice, so you go 'head and live with your pops
Come on, ma, you know better
Even though you got your own cheddar
We can spend mine together
Can't lie, I even think about us dyin' together
In the same house that we planned to buy together
Jenny, it's all about you
I only trick 'cause I'm allowed to
But it don't mean ish without you

[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez]
You think the money that you make (That you make)
Can substitute the time you take (The time you take)
Take the keys here to my heart
Then you can win my heart, and get what's in my heart (Don't cost a thing)
I think you need to take some time
To show me that your love is true (Ooh)
There's more than dollar signs in you
Then you can win my heart, and get what's in my heart

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Think you gotta keep me iced? You don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash? I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing (Love don't cost a thing)
Think I wanna drive your Benz? I don't
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke (Even if you were broke)
My love don't cost a thing (My love don't cost a thing)
Think you gotta keep me iced? You don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash? I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz? I don't (Think I wanna)
If I wanna floss, I got my own (If I wanna, don't)
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think you gotta keep me iced? You don't (Think I wanna)
Think I'm gonna spend your cash? I won't (If I want my own)
Even if you were broke

You must be thinking, how did I get here?
And I wonder if you've been here before
So many things I want to ask you and know about you
You seem like you are ready to run
Stand right up and walk out that door
Oh yes, you've been here before
But for this moment you're all mine
So let's just take it one step at a time

And make it lasts as long as we can
It's already going too fast

He chose me for you and you for I
You have things to teach me
I have a feeling inside
I have this vision of three of us
Holding hands
Through a valley and jumping towards the sky

[Chorus]
One step at a time
No need to rush
Let's keep this time for us
And make it lasts as long as we can
It's already going too fast

How can three become one?
You're the greatest thing that I've ever done
I want to create a world
You will always want comeback to
And here's my wish for both of you

One step at a time
No need to rush

Upon a rock I rest my head
There I vision through the seas of oppression, oh-oo-wo!
Don't make my life a prison

[Chorus]

We come from Trench Town, Trench Town (Trench town)
Most of them come from Trench Town
We free the people with music (sweet music)

With music, oh music
Oh-y, my head
In desolate places we'll find our bread
And everyone see what's taking place, oh-oo-wo!
Another page in history

[Verse 2]
They say it's hard to speak
They feel so strong to say we are weak
But through the eyes the love of our people, oh-oo-wo!
They've got to repay
We come from (Trench town) Trench Town
We come from (Trench town) Trench Town
Trench - Trench Town (Trench town)
They say, "Can anything good come out of Trench Town?
(Trench - Trench town)
That's what they say, (Trench town); (Trench - Trench town)
Say (Trench - Trench town) we're the underprivileged people
So (Trench town) they keep us in chains
"Pay (Trench - Trench town) - pay - pay tribute to -" (Trench town)
We come from (Trench - Trench town)
We come from (Trench - Trench town)
Just because we come from Trench Town
Not because we come from Trench Town

I could wait all night and day
To go to a party, sit down and wait
Give my request to the DJ
'Cause my song, he's gotta play (Just play my song)
And when I hear that beat, I get my body up out my seat
I grab a guy and move my feet
He's playing my song

Turn it up 'cause it turns me on
Keep dancing all night long

When it stops, better press rewind (Play that shit again)
Let me hear it one more time

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
Stiff-necked fools, you think you are cool
To deny me for simplicity
Yes, you have gone for so long
With your love for vanity now
Yes, you have got the wrong interpretation
Mixed up with vain imagination

So take Jah Sun, and Jah Moon
And Jah Rain, and Jah Stars
And forever, yes, erase your fantasy, yea-yeah!

[Verse 1]
The lips of the righteous teach many
But fools die for want of wisdom
The rich man's wealth is in his city
The righteous' wealth is in his Holy Place

So take Jah Sun, and Jah Moon
And Jah Rain, and Jah Stars
And forever, yes, erase your fantasy, yeah!
Destruction of the poor is in their poverty
Destruction of the soul is vanity, yeah!

[Chorus]
So stiff-necked fools, you think you are cool
To deny me for simplicity, yea-ea-yeah!
Yes, you have gone - gone for so long
With your love for vanity now

[Verse 2]
But I don't want to rule you!
I don't want to fool you!
I don't want to school you
Things you - you might never know about!

Yes, you have got the wrong interpretation
Mixed up with vain - vain imagination
Stiff-necked fools, you think you are cool
To deny me for, o-ooh, simplicity 

[fadeout]

[Chorus]
Now you get what you want
Do you want more? (want more)
Now you get what you want
Do you want more? (want more)

[Verse 1]
You think it's the end
But it's just the beginning
You think it's the end
But it's just the beginning
Go down back-biter, down back-bite, down back-biter, down back-bite
Down back-biter, down back-biter, down back-biter, down back-bite

They stab you in the back
And they claim that you are not looking
But Jah have them in the region
In the valley of decision
They stab you in the back
And they claim that you are not looking
But Jah have them in the region
In the valley of decision
In the valley of decision
Go down back-biter, down back-bite, down back-biter, down back-bite

[Chorus]
Now you get what you want
Do you want more? (want more)
Now you get what you want
Do you want more? (want more)

Go down back-biter, down back-bite, down back-biter, down back-bite
Go down back-biter, down back-bite, down back-biter, down back-bite

[Verse 2]
They stab you in the back
And they claim that you're not looking
But Jah have them in the region
In the valley of decision
Now: what you want
Want more? Want more
Now: what you get
Want more? Want more
Now - Now: do you want more
You think it's the end? (think it's the end)
Do you want more? (want more) (you think it's the end)

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Now, what you want
Want more? Want more

[Intro]
Wo, man, there you are!

[Verse 1]
When the race gets hard to run
It means you just can't take the pace
When it's time to have your fun
You find the tears run on down through your face
Then you stop and think a little
Are you the victim of the system?
Anyday now they gone let you down
Remember, Natty will be there
To see you through

[Verse 2]
(I)	And is it good to know (know) now
Jah will be waiting there
(I) won't it doggone good to know (know) , you all
Jah will be waiting there
Wait in Summer, wait in Spring
Wait in Autumn, Winter thing
(Tribe) goes up, all the tribe goes down
Bring my children from the end of the earth

[Verse 3]
Many a time I sit and wonder why
This race so - so very hard to run
Then I say to my soul: take courage
Battle to be won
Like a ship that's tossed and driven
Battered by the angry sea, yea-eah!
Say the tide of time was raging
Don't let the fury fall on me, no, no!

[Outro]
(I) Cause I know (know) -know
Jah will be waiting there
(I) Ain't it good to know (know) now
Jah will be waiting there. Wo-oo-o-oo-o! Ooh, yeah!
Lost and found, who speak I give
Lost and found, who speak I give
Speak I give, lost and found
Lost and found, who speak I give
Lost and found, who speak I give

[Pre-Chorus]
Jah would never give the power to a bald head
Run come crucify the Dread

[Chorus]
Time alone - oh, time will tell
Think you are in heaven, but you living in hell
Think you are in heaven, but you living in hell
Think you are in heaven, but you living in hell
Time alone - oh, time will tell
You think you are in heaven, but you living in hell

Back them up, not the brothers
But the ones who sets them up

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Mmm, sold my freedom 'round the world
Sold man to the ground
Sold man, took a man pride
Oh, children, weep no more
Oh, my sycamore tree, saw the freedom tree
Saw you settle the score
Oh, children, weep no more

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Your relation to me
Feeds my empty existence
I guess I choose what to see
Because I’m feeling resistance
So turn the lights on below
The time we have is too precious
You say that you’ll never go
I know that lying is infectious now
So don’t let me down

[Chorus]
I’m breaking my own rules today, ohh
I know that I should walk away, ohh
I’m falling again for someone who doesn’t feel alright
That’s the story of my life

[Verse 2]
I thought you were ready to be
The start of my happy ending
Sometimes I choose what to see
Forget what I’ve been defending
Before the day fades to day
There comes a break in the weather
I made you say goodbye
Because I can’t say forever, now
So don’t let me down, no

[Chorus]
I’m breaking my own rules today, ohh
I know that I should walk away, ohh
I’m falling again for someone who doesn’t feel alright
That’s the story of my life

[Bridge]
One in a million
But if you are ready to listen
I know that I can be stubborn
Maybe it’s me but I’ve been too blind to see

[Chorus]
I’m breaking my own rules today, ohh
I know that I should walk away, ohh
I’m falling again for someone who doesn’t feel alright
That’s the story of my life

[Outro]
Keep walking, I keep walking
Keep walking, I keep walking
Keep walking, I keep walking
That’s the story of my life

[Intro]
Oh oh oh

And that's why I'm gonna hold you down
So when you want me

'Cause you be there to catch me whenever I start falling
When I'm with you, I get stronger everyday
That's why I say (oh oh oh)

The pressure around me just couldn't see

Still we know now, we'll never see smoke without fire
And everyone you see has a heart desire

[Verse 1]
Riding in the bus down the boulevard
And the place was pretty packed (Yeah!)
Couldn't find a seat so I had to stand
With the perverts in the back
It was smelling like a locker room
There was junk all over the floor
We're already packed in like sardines
But we're stopping to pick up more, look out

[Hook]
Another one rides the bus
Another one rides the bus
Another comes on and another comes on
Another one rides the bus
Hey, he's gonna sit by you
Another one rides the bus

[Verse 2]
There's a suitcase poking me in the ribs
There's an elbow in my ear
There's a smelly old bum standing next to me
Hasn't showered in a year
I think I'm missing a contact lens
I think my wallet's gone
And I think this bus is stopping again
To let a couple more freaks get on, look out

[Hook]
Another one rides the bus
Another one rides the bus
Another comes on and another comes on
Another one rides the bus
Hey, he's gonna sit by you

The window doesn't open and the fan is broke
And my face is turning blue (Yeah)
I haven't been in a crowd like this
Since I went to see The Who
Well I should've got off a couple miles ago
But I couldn't get to the door
There isn't any room for me to breathe
And now we're gonna pick up more, yeaaah

Another comes on and another comes on

Hey, he's gonna sit by you

You running and you running

You must have done (must have done)
Something wrong (something wrong)
Said: you must have done (must have done)
Wo! Something wrong (something wrong)
Why you can't find the
Place where you belong?

[Verse 2]
Every man thinking his
Burden is the heaviest (heaviest)
Every man thinking his
Burden is the heaviest (heaviest)
You still mean it: Who feels it knows it, Lord
Who feels it knows it, Lord
Who feels it knows it, Lord
Who feels it knows it, Lord

[Chorus]

Yeah-eah-eah-eah - from yourself

[Verse 3]
Brr - you must have done something
Something - something - something
Something you don't want nobody to know about
You must have, Lord - something wrong
What you must have done - you must have done something wrong
Why you can't find where you belong?

And I don't want to live with no strife. (running away)
It is better to live on the housetop (running away)
Than to live in a house full of confusion. (running away)
So, I made my decision and I left you (running away)
Now you coming to tell me (running away)
That I'm running away (running away)
But it's not true (running away)
I am not running away (running away)

Good evening, hi
It's your weather guy

From my greedy old hands!

And, baby, in high tide or low tide
I will be by your side
I will be by your side

[Verse 2]
I said I heard my mother
She was crying (I heard her crying), yeah! (Crying, crying)
And the tears that she shed (The tears that she shed)
They still linger in my head (Lingers in my head)

She said: "A child is born in this world
He needs protection
God, guide and protect us
When we are wrong, (When we're wrong), correct us

[Outro]
And in high seas or low seas
I am going to be your friend
I am going to be your friend
Said, high tide or low tide
I will be by your side
I will be by your side

[Chorus]
Jah live! Children yeah!
Jah Jah live! Children yeah

[Verse 1]
The truth is an offense but not a sin!
Is he who laugh last, children! is he who win
It's a foolish dog bark at a flying bird!
One sheep must learn, children! to respect the shepherd!

[Chorus]
Jah live! Children yeah!
Jah Jah live! Children yeah
Jah live! Children yeah
Jah Jah live! Children yeah

[Musical Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Fools saying in their heart

But I and I know, Jah Jah!
Dread, it shall be dread a dread

[Chorus]

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
And mommy used to tell me one day some girl gone get me
But I won't know love if it walk right up and hit me
And if I fall to the ground I get up and fight another round
And I got money on my mind, money on my mind, but now

[Hook]
I keep thinking of you, I keep, I keep thinking of you, I keep thinking of you
Girl, I keep thinking of you, I keep, I keep thinking of you, I keep thinking of you
I keep, I keep thinking of you, I keep, I keep thinking of you, I keep thinking of you
Girl, I keep thinking of you, I keep, I keep thinking of you, girl

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
And we ain't even gotta go far, we ain't gotta talk about the war, we can just (Get it (7x)
I said we ain't even gotta go far, we ain't gotta talk about the war, we can just (Get it (7x)

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Damn I'm just thinking home 3 winner
Chirping late night, she had the light up antenna
Voices far from ?
13 speaking like we 23 sometimes I would even miss dinner
Cause talking with you felt more important than Jordan's release when the 17's, remember
I get em, similar to any girl I've mentioned
They only thought I'd mention I'm only playing with your intuition
Your senses sensed that I was different
But too flashy for boyfriend material
But I beg to differ
And this is it I'm showing you more material
Now listen, let's Kiss, like Gene Simmons
I've got a vision, fuck a title
We the perfect image, you and I
No eyein' them, them girls, you be eyein' them, cause they be eyein' him
They water stronger than vitamins
Loving you to death, I didn't expect
Beautiful girls, make you suicidal
I guess I'm dyin' then..

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Up jump the boogie, and shorty said she feeling my flavor
And even when I ain't looking, I got her on my radar
And yes I know man I am so, so blessed to have her
So yesterday, today, and the day after; I keep thinking of you
I keep thinking of you

[Hook]

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Shorty said she feeling my swag
Shorty said she feeling my style
I keep thinking about her
About you, about you

I keep, I keep, I keep thinking of you, I keep, I keep thinking of you, girl
I keep, I keep, thinking of you I keep, I keep thinking of you, girl
I keep thinking of you, I keep, I keep thinking of you
All the things I could do, I could do them to you
And I'm thinking of you, thinking of you

Young Moulah baby
I spilled my drink
Change your drawers baby
Will somebody please please double-cup me
Im tryin to run away from temptations, but the shit’s calling
I’m at the Ritz Carlton, sitting in this bitch balling
I know these women faking and still I can’t call it
They like you drive, but ain’t arrivin when your whip is stallin
I thought this fame shit would change shit
I turn around, I’m still surrounded by the same shit
I’m on a champagne sip, got the flame late still moving up
It’s open seas like the salve ship, buffling the plague click
You know you with the don its whatever
Lyrically im Kobe and Lebron put together
Niggas can’t accept it so they tell me that im soundin like
Uh, a bunch of rappers that dont sound alike
Fuck you, man, I’m off the subject
These niggers be faking, these bitches be hating
Shit, I’m about my budget
First class from the seven is filling the norms
Scotty Gripping balling win to my women is from
That’s why they love the dome
In house left the keys out and never know
Give me two bad bitches, I give my Elleanor
And some ice cold water to sip this lemon all
Fuck you niggers, you nigga’s about fifty
She’s skinny and gold jimmy
For you think you fuck strictly I’m here to get fucked quickly
Scar mouth, she got Mohawk and he thoughts
With a left dress, which body is the mess
Don’t be a dog, I can show you how I’m pimping
Rather leash neat this lifestyle when I’m limping
Rule number one, keep your head up in the wind
You gotta, gotta make some money, go bananas like it’s chimping
Folks don’t ever know, heard this pussy niggers hating, fuck, who ever do
Fly diva, I eat her if she had a boo, but she got to have millions, rapper villie on, stacks on zillion
You rolling with the state up next, ball met your face like a break up, nigga
And I see I’m trying to take up next, we gonna make a next call it jake out, nigga
We need to fight for, nigga, switch your side, tell me who you ride for
Do your verge, stop and turn it, nigga, fight for
Pump seven out of eleven bottle side shore
I got worry, we should kill it, nigga, why for?
Can in the stupid your level, I’m in the sky more
I’m in the Louie V style, shit is Gucci guitar
I’m meaning Suzuki models give me Gucci a lot
Bitch, I’m mobbing through the mall, got trullies ‘em all
You’re telling get money, niggers, while I’m truly depart
Me and sun shine up a deal, best skin coping for another winning
Have ‘em like the track field how you run up in it
‘till it’s dead and finished, hop in mane and fuck it with it
Why is they fucking with me? On my shit, get off my dick
Don’t know what this money all mean
All I’m left and all I’m which, c’mon

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah...
Hit the East Side of the LBC
On a mission trynna find Mr. Warren G
When I jumped off the porch, I was forced into last resort
Of a typical short end, of course where that took us course
Hoarse for yelling out Demons that fought inside of me, talk society how to rejoice
Killers aside of me, privacy obviously was lost
Fraud, Piracy of the streets of my Odyssey
Caught a bullet that probably destroyed
A good kid in a mad city slightly annoyed
I walk out the street with no heat and wanted to beef when i"m just a vegan
Reeking the scent of a saint, sinner smelling the stars squeezing
Pillars stumbling straight to my melon apparent reason
Probably because i'm a cousin, cousin of blood that blooded in public
And Kendrick seen with him last weekend, cousin
But you ain't' no friend of me, instead of Kendrick i'm Kennedy
Assassinate my character, sure, if that's your remedy
Fair enough, i got enemies, but guess who bang?
But that's the repercussion like when your cousin is cussing a blood and your by yourself at the Compton parade
Good kid, mad city, life or death, is you with me?

[Verse 1]
This is well proven fact man
Laser beams on top of mats and
Faded jeans and El Rukn hats man
Gangsta scene failed moving pack yeah
But you can tell that I failed shootin' that man
You see I excelled moving that kinda
Hard to explain where you and L-U at man
Smooth criminals, cats pushing ki's, gangsta leans
Flipping quarters, drive through giving orders
But ya'll don't understand me it's like
Bravo Pagering, breakin' balls, puttin'
Blows in the faces of the fiends
I was peepin' through the cracks, yeah
Niggas tryna stab 'em in they back, runnin'
Game on the dames, they stay strapped make you
Part of the war, this is...

[Verse 2]
You see, Little Rascal but I was Otay
Any could relate to any, even though she ain't
Have a family, life had a few hard knocks but I
Turned out okay, tryin' to write this in my own
Mind, yeah, but I'm no Jay, now, It Was Written
Couldn't justify why no Timberlake, I, mind your
Own business don't deliberate mine, went from
Refrigerate to incinerate fly of the inner state
If you wanna go berserk, put you/picture on a T-Shirt
Will commemorate dye/die, if thee wanna test we like
Yes and Parri(???), see, sigh, been that way since
I was waist high, product of television, Nintendo
And the inner city/Windy City(???) lookin' out my
Project window, symphony/simply(???) I...

[Verse 3]
Now let me pick up where I left off, I slicker
Than KY, then I started I grow, got hip, started
To know, same time learned gang signs, made rhymes
Started to flow, facial hair started to grow
Started a fro, but I couldn't take home in it so
I parted it low, I started talkin' to hoes, wanted
To dress fresh so I gotta walk for the dough
But the road that I took for dimes was full of bumps
Like books for the blinds, full of chumps, full of crooks
Full of crime, the remained full of sharks
Full of good for the gram(???), and that there right to it
A heart full of grime(???), whole episode left me
Marked into mine, I had to make a change like March
Of The Dimes, stop, change channels like channel locks(???)
Wass...

[Intro]
Takin’ off

[Verse 1]
I was told a million times of all the troubles in my way
Mind you grow a little wiser, little better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers and I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started, bread and butter for a smile
Well I sold a million mirrors in a shop in Alley Way
But I never saw my face in any window any day
Now they say your folks are telling you, "Be a superstar"
But I tell you, just be satisfied and stay right where you are

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive (Yeah), keep yourself alive
Take you all your time and-a money, honey, you'll survive

[Verse 2]
Well, I've loved a million women in a belladonic haze
And I ate a million dinners brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need to feed my body and my soul
And I'll grow a little bigger, maybe that can be my goal
I was told a million times of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying and get better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers and I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started, same as when I started

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive (Come on), keep yourself alive
Take you all your time and-a money, honey, you'll survive (Shake)

[Interlude]
(Ow!)

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive (Whoa), keep yourself alive
Oh, take you all your time and-a money to keep me satisfied

[Bridge]
Do you think you're better every day?
No, I just think I'm two steps nearer to my grave

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive (Come on), keep yourself alive
You take your time and take my money, keep yourself alive

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive (Come on), keep yourself alive
All you people, keep yourself alive

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive (Come on, come on), keep yourself alive
Take you all your time and-a money to keep me satisfied

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive, keep yourself alive
All you people, keep yourself alive

[Outro]
Take you all your time and money, honey, you will survive
Keep you satisfied, keep yourself alive

[Verse 1]
Yesterday, my life was in ruin
Now today, I know what I'm doin'
Got a feeling I should be doing all right

[Refrain]
Doing all right

[Verse 2]
Where will I be this time tomorrow?
Jumped in joy or sinking in sorrow?
Anyway, I should be doing all right

[Refrain]
Doing all right

[Bridge]
Should be waiting for the sun
Looking 'round to find the words to say
Should be waiting for the skies to clear
Every time in all the world
Should be waiting for the sun
And anyway, I've got to hide away

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ooh
Yesterday, my life was in ruin
Now today, God knows what I'm doin'
Anyway, I should be doing all right

[Refrain]
Doing all right

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Doing all right

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Great King Rat died today
Born on the twenty-first of May
Died, syphilis, forty-four on his birthday
Every second word he swore
Yes, he was the son of a whore
Always wanted by the law

[Chorus]
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know, people?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you?
Would you like to see?

Now hear this

[Verse 2]
Where will I be tomorrow?
Will I beg? Will I borrow?
I don't care, I don't care (anyway)
Come on, come on, the time is right
The man is evil and that is right
I told you (Ah, yes, I told you)
And that's no lie (Oh, no, no)

[Chorus]
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you?
Would you like to see?

Show me!

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
People (People)
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you?
Would you like to see?

Hit it!

[Bridge 1]
Now listen, all you people
Put out the good and keep the bad
Don't believe all you read in the Bible
You sinners get in line
Saints you leave far behind
Very soon you're gonna be his disciple
Don't listen to what Mama says
Not a word, not a word Mama says
Or else you'll find yourself being the rival (sure)
The great Lord, before he died
Knelt sinners by his side
And said "You're going to realize tomorrow"

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge 2]
No, I'm not gonna tell you
What you already know
'Cause time and time again
The old man said it all a long time ago
Come, come on, the time is right
This evil man will fight
I told you once before

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Just like I said before
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
The last time I tell you
Would you like to see?

[Outro]

[Intro]
Ah, ah

[Verse 1]
In the land where horses born with eagle wings
And honey bees have lost their stings
There's singing forever (Ooh, yeah)
Lion's den with fallow deer
And rivers made from wine so clear
Flow on and on forever
Dragons fly like sparrows through the air
And baby lambs where Samson dares
To go on, on, on, on
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...)

[Verse 2]
My fairy king (He rules the air and turns the tides)
He rules the air and can see things that are not there
For you and me to see (Ooh, yeah)
My fairy king (He guides the winds)
He can do right and nothing wrong

[Verse 3]
(Ah) Then came man to savage in the night
To run like thieves and to kill like knives
To take away the power from the magic hand
To bring about the ruin to the promised land
(Ooh, ooh)

[Verse 4]
They turn milk into sour, like the blue in the blood of my veins
(Why can't you see it?)
Fire burnin' in hell with the cry of screaming pain
(Son of heaven set me free and let me go)
Sea turns dry, no salt from sand
And seasons fly no helping hand
Teeth don't shine like pearls for poor men's eyes (No more)

[Bridge]
Someone, someone
Has drained the color from my wings
Broken my fairy circle ring
And shamed the king in all his pride
Changed the winds and wronged the tides
Oh, Mother Mercury (Mercury)
Look what they've done to me (Yeah)
I cannot run, I cannot hide

[Outro]

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I have sinned, dear Father
Father, I have sinned
Try and help me, Father
Won't you let me in?

[Chorus]
Liar!
Oh, nobody believes me
Liar!
Why don't you leave me alone?

[Verse 2]
Sire, I have stolen
Stolen many times
Raised my voice in anger
When I know I never should

[Chorus]
Liar!
Oh, everybody deceives me
Liar!
Why don't you leave me alone?

[Bridge]
(Liar!) I have sailed the seas
(Liar!) From Mars to Mercury
(Liar!) I have drunk the wine
(Liar!) Time after time
(Liar!) You're lying to me
(Liar!) Oh, you're lying to me

Father, please forgive me
You know you'll never leave me
Please, will you direct me in the right way?
Liar, liar, liar, liar!
Liar! (That's what they keep calling me)
Liar! (Every day, every night)
Liar, liar!
(Oh, let me go)

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Listen!
Are you gonna listen?
Mama I'm gonna be your slave
(All day long)
Mama, I'm gonna try to behave
(All day long)
Mama, I'm gonna be your slave
(All day long)
I'm gonna serve you 'til your dying day
(All day long)
I'm gonna keep you 'til your dying day
(All day long)
I'm gonna kneel down by your side and pray
(All day long)
And pray
(All day long)
And pray
(All day long)
And pray
(All day long)
(All day long)
(All day long) all day long
(All day long) all day long
(All day long) all day long
(All day long) all day long
Yeah! (we have lift-off!)

[Bass Solo]

[Outro]
All day long, all day long, all day long
Liar, liar, they never ever let you win
Liar, liar, everything you do is sin
Liar, nobody believes you
Liar, they bring you down before you begin
Ooh, now let me tell you this
So now you know you could
Be dead before they let you
Aah

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
When I was young it came to me
And I could see the sun breaking
Lucy was high and so was I
Dazzling, holding the world inside
Once I believed in everyone
Everyone and anyone can see

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, the night comes down
And I get afraid of losing my way
Oh-oh, the night comes down
Ooh, and it's dark again

[Verse 2]
Once I could laugh with everyone
Once I could see the good in me
The black and the white distinctively
Colouring, holding the world inside
Now all the world is grey to me
Nobody can see
You gotta believe it

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, the night comes down
And I get afraid of losing my way
Oh-oh, the night comes down
Oooh, and it's dark again
And it's dark again
And it's dark again

[Outro]

[Intro]
I am hooked on you
Yeah, I'm ready to go
I'm ready to dance
Are you? I wanna see it

[Verse 1]
Lights turn always like 90 degrees
Your standing on the wall, but baby, not me
Taking center stage, come on the floor
Rolling 'til I break doing this and more
Lights turn always like 90 degrees
Your standing on the wall, but baby, not me
Taking center stage, come on the floor
Rolling till I break, doing this and more

[Verse 2]
Do it to the floor, boy, shake
Do it 'til the windows break
The whole room vibrates
And it's like an earthquake
Do it to the floor, boy, shake
Do it 'til the windows break
The whole room vibrates
And it's like an earthquake

[Pre-Chorus]
Just lace them shoes tight
And bring it down to the floor (That's right)
Under these lights (We working it hard)
I take him back to the hood

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm hooked, I'm hooked on you
I'm hooked, I'm hooked on you
I'm hooked, I'm hooked on you
On you, on you

[Verse 3]
I say it again like I said it before
I'm in the middle, took it to the floor
Shadows on the wall, steam is on my back
Sweat dripping hard, feel it drip, drip, drop
I say it again like I said it before
I'm in the middle, took it to the floor
Shadows on the wall, steam is on my back
Sweat dripping hard, feel it drip, drip, drop

[Verse 2]
Do it to the floor, boy, shake
Do it 'til the windows break
The whole room vibrates
And it's like an earthquake
Do it to the floor, boy, shake
Do it 'til the windows break
The whole room vibrates
And it's like an earthquake

[Pre-Chorus]
Just lace them shoes tight
And bring it down to the floor (That's right)
Under these lights (We working it hard)
I take him back to the hood

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm hooked I'm hooked on you
I'm hooked, I'm hooked on you
I'm hooked, I'm hooked on you
On you, on you

[Pre-Chorus]
Just lace them shoes tight
And bring it down to the floor (That's right)
Under these lights (We working it hard)
I take him back to the hood

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm hooked, I'm hooked on you
I'm hooked, I'm hooked on you
I'm hooked, I'm hooked on you
On you, on you

[Post-Chorus]
Look right here, baby, don't stop now
Forget them people and forget the crowd
Loving in the club, no, not right now
Sweating until it hurt while the music's loud
Look right here, baby, don't stop now
Forget them people and forget the crowd
Loving in the club, no, not right now
Sweating until it hurt while the music's loud

[Bridge]
Like that, like that
I like it like that
I like it like that
My neck and my back
Like that, like that
I like it like that
I like it like that
My neck and my back

[Pre-Chorus]
Just lace them shoes tight
And bring it down to the floor (That's right)
Under these lights (We working it hard)
I take him back to the hood

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm hooked, I'm hooked on you
I'm hooked, I'm hooked on you
I'm hooked, I'm hooked on you
On you, on you (You, you)

[Verse 1]
Had to make do with the worn
Out rock and roll scene
The old bop is getting tired, need a rest
Well, you know what I mean
'58 that was great but it's over now
And that's all
Somethin' harder's coming up
Gonna really knock a hole in the wall
Gonna hit ya, grab ya hard
Make you feel ten feet tall

[Verse 2]
Well, I hope that big new baby's
Gonna come along soon
You don't know it could happen
Any ol' rainy afternoon
With the temperature down
And the jukebox blowin' no fuse
And my musical life's feelin'
Like a long Sunday School cruise
And you know that there's one thing
Every single body could use
Yeah, listen to me baby
Let me tell you what it's all about

[Chorus]
(Modern times) rock and roll
(Modern times) rock and roll

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Get your high heeled guitar-style boots
And some groovy clothes
Get a hair piece on your chest
And a ring through your nose
Find a nice little man who says
He's gonna make you a real big star
Stars in your eyes and ants in your pants
Think you should go far
Everybody in this bum sucking world
Gonna know who you are
(Look out)

[Outro]
(Modern times) rock and roll

[Intro]
I want you-ooh, ahh
Woman

[Verse 1]
Tried to be a son and daughter
Rolled into one
You said you'd equal any man
For having your fun

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, now didn't you feel surprised to find
The cap just didn't fit?
The world expects a man
To buckle down and to shovel shit
What'll you do for loving
When it's only just begun?

[Chorus]
I want you-ooh
To be a woman, yeah

[Verse 2]
Tried to be a teacher
And a fisher of men
An equal people preacher
Will you lead us all the same?

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I traveled around
The world and found
A brand new word for day
Watching the time, mustn't linger behind
Pardon me, I have to get away
Ooh, what'll you think of heaven
If it's back from where you came?

[Chorus]
I want you-ooh
To be a woman

[Outro]
I want you to be a woman, yeah
You know I'm gonna save the world
Now you've just begun
Alright!

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Fear me you Lords
And lady preachers
I descend upon your earth
From the skies
I command your very souls
You unbelievers

[Chorus]
Bring before me what is mine
The seven seas of Rhye

[Verse 2]
Can you hear me you peers
And privy counselors?
I stand before you naked to the eyes
I will destroy any man
Who dares abuse my trust

[Chorus]
I swear that you'll be mine
The seven seas of Rhye

[Bridge]
Sister, I live and lie for you
Mister, do and I'll die
You are mine, I possess you
I belong to you forever (Ever, ever)

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Storm the master-marathon
I’ll fly through
By flash and thunder-fire
And I'll survive (I'll survive, I'll survive)
Then I'll defy the laws of nature (I'll survive, I'll survive, I'll survive)
And come out alive, then I'll get you
Be gone with you
You shod and shady senators
Give out the good
Leave out the bad evil cries
I challenge the mighty Titan
And his troubadours

[Chorus]
And with a smile
I'll take you to the seven seas of Rhye

[Outro]
Oh I do like to be beside the seaside!
Oh I do like to be beside by the sea
I do like to stroll upon the Prom, Prom, Prom!
Where the brass band plays: "tiddely-om-pom-pom!"

Oh I do like to be beside the seaside!
Oh I do like to be beside by the sea
When I'm down beside the sea, I'm beside meself with glee
Beside the seaside! Beside the sea

[Verse 1]
Been here before a long time ago
But this time I wear no sandals
Ages past I gave all you people
Food and water

[Verse 2]
Three feet tall, so very small
I'm no trouble
I bring thunder, lightning, sun and the rain
For all the people in the land

[Verse 3]
A message of love
I bring you from up above
All good children, gather around
Come join your hands and sing along

[Chorus]
They call me mad the swine
I guess I'm mad the swine
I've come to save you, save you
Mad the swine
Mad the swine
So all you people, gather around
Hold out your hands and praise the Lord

[Verse 4]
I'll walk upon the water, just as before
I'll help the meek and the mild, and the lepers and the blind
And all the creatures
Great and small

[Bridge]
Let me take you to the river without a fall
Oh, and then one day you realize
You're all the same within his eyes
That's all I've got to say, just like before

[Chorus]
They call me mad the swine
Mad the swine
I've come to save you, save you
Mad the swine
Mad the swine
So all you people, gather around
Hold out your hands and praise the Lord

Oo-ooh

[Bongo Solo]

Woah, now
So all you people, gather around
Hold out your hands and praise the Lord
Don't ever fail me!

[Chorus]
Mad the swine
Mad the swine
I've come to save you, save you (Woah, now)
Mad the swine
Mad the swine
So all you people, gather around
Hold out your hands and praise the Lord

[Outro]
Hands and praise the Lord
Praise the Lord
Get down on my knees and praise the Lord

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
A word in your ear, from father to son
Hear the word that I say
I fought with you, fought on your side
Long before you were born

[Chorus]
Joyful the sound
The word goes around
From father to son, to son

[Verse 2]
And the voice is so clear
Time after time it keeps
Calling you, calling you on
Don't destroy what you see
Your country to be
Just keep building
On the ground that's been won

[Chorus]
Kings will be crowned
And the word goes around
From father to son, to son

[Bridge]
Won't you hear us sing
Our family song?
(Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba)
Ooh yeah, now we hand it on
But I've heard it all before
Take this letter that I give you
Take it, sonny, hold it high
You won't understand
A word that's in it
But you'll write it all again
Before you die, yeah, yeah

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
A word in your ear from father to son
Funny you don't hear a single word I say
But my letter to you will stay by your side
Through the years till the loneliness is gone
(Sing if you will)
But the air you breathe I live to give you
Father to son, father to son

[Outro]
Joyful the sound, the word goes around
From father to son, to son
Kings will be crowned
The word goes around
From father to son, to son
Joyful the sound, the word goes around
From father to son, to son
Kings will be crowned
The word goes around
From father to son, to son

[Intro]
So sad, her eyes
Smiling, dark eyes
So sad, her eyes
As it began

[Verse 1]
On such a breathless night as this
Upon my brow, the lightest kiss
I walked alone

[Verse 2]
And all around the air did say
My lady soon will stir this way
In sorrow known

[Bridge]
The white queen walks
And the night grows pale
Stars of lovingness in her hair

[Chorus]
Needing, unheard
Pleading, one word
So sad, my eyes
She cannot see

[Verse 3]
How did thee fare? What have thee seen?
The mother of the willow green
I call her name

[Verse 4]
And 'neath her window have I stayed
I loved the footsteps that she made
And when she came

[Bridge]
White queen how my heart did ache
And dry my lips no word would make
So still I wait

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
My goddess hear my darkest fear
I speak too late
It's forevermore that I wait
Dear friend, goodbye
No tears in my eyes

[Outro]
So sad it ends
As it began

[Verse 1]
You never heard my song before
The music was too loud
But now I think you hear me well
For now, we both know how

[Chorus]
No star can light our way
In this cloud of dark and fear
But someday, one day

[Verse 2]
Funny how the pages turn
And hold us in between
A misty castle waits for you
And you shall be a queen
(You shall be a queen)

[Chorus]
Today the cloud it hangs
Over us and all is grey
But someday, one day

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
When I was you and you were me
And we were very young
Together took us nearly there
The rest may not be sung

[Chorus]
So still the cloud it hangs
Over us and we're alone
But someday, one day
We'll come home

[Verse 1]
Mama's gotta problem
She don't know what to say
Her little baby boy
Has just left home today

[Chorus]
She's got to be the loser in the end
She's got to be the loser in the end
Misuse her and you'll lose her as a friend
She's Ma on whom you can always depend

[Verse 2]
She washed and fed
And clothed and cared
For nearly twenty years
And all she gets is "goodbye Ma"
And the nighttime's for her tears

[Chorus]
She's got to be the loser in the end
She's got to be the loser in the end
Misuse her and you'll lose her as a friend
She's Ma on whom you can always depend

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
So listen, mothers everywhere
To just one mother's son
You'll get forgotten on the way
If you don't let them have their fun
Forget regrets, and just remember
It's not so long since you were young

[Outro]
You're bound to be the loser in the end
You're bound to be the loser in the end
They'll choose their new shoes
That's not far to bend
You're Ma on whom they can always depend

[Intro]
Ahh! Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ahh!

[Verse 1]
Now once upon a time
An old man told me a fable
When the piper is gone
And the soup is cold on your table
And if the black crow flies
To find a new destination
That is the sign

[Chorus]
Come tonight
Come to the ogre site
Come to the ogre battle fight

[Verse 2]
He gives a great big cry
And he can swallow up the ocean
With a mighty tongue he catches flies
The palm of a hand the incredible size
One great big eye
Has a focus in your direction
Now the battle is on
Yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Come tonight
Come to the ogre site
Come to the ogre battle fight

[Bridge]
The ogre men are still inside
The two-way mirror mountain
Gotta keep down right out of sight
You can't see in, but they can see out
"Ooh, keep a lookout!"
The ogre-men are coming out
From the two-way mirror mountain
They're running up behind
And they're coming all about
Can't go east 'cos you gotta go south

[Instrumental break]
(Ahhhh!)

[Verse 3]
Ogre-men are going home
And the great big fight is over
Bugle blow, let trumpet cry
Ogre battle lives for ever more

[Outro]
Oh-ho-ho
You can come along
You can come along
Come to ogre battle

[Verse 1]
There's no living in my life anymore
The seas have gone dry
And the rain stopped falling
Please don't you cry anymore (Ahh)
Can't you see?
Listen to the breeze
Whisper to me, please
Don't send me to the path
Of nevermore

[Verse 2]
Even the valleys below
Where the rays of the sun
Were so warm and tender
Now haven't anything to grow (Ahh)
Can't you see?
Why did you have to leave me?
(Nevermore, nevermore)
Why did you deceive me?
(Nevermore, nevermore)
Send me to the path
Of nevermore (Ahh)
When you say you didn't love me
Anymore (Aahh)
(Ahh)

[Outro]
Nevermore
Nevermore

[Intro]
Do you mean it
Do you mean it
Do you mean it
Why don't you mean it
Why do I follow you
And where do you go

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 1]
You've never seen nothing
Like it no never in your life
Like going up to heaven
And then coming back alive
Let me tell you all about it
(And the world will so allow it)
Ooh, give me a little time to choose
Water babies singing
In a lily-pool delight
Blue powder monkeys
Praying in the dead of night

[Chorus]
Here comes the Black Queen
Poking in the pile
Fie-Fo the Black Queen, marching single file
Take this, take that
Bring them down to size
(March to the Black Queen)

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Put them in the cellar
With the naughty boys
A little bit of sugar
Then a rub-a dub-a baby oil

[Chorus]
Black on, black on
Every finger nail and toe
We've only begun, begun
Make this, make that
Keep making all that noise
(Oooh, march to the Black Queen)

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, now I've got a belly-full
You can be my sugar-baby
You can be my honey-chile, yes

[Guitar Solo]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
A voice from behind me reminds me
Spread out your wings, you are an angel
Remember to deliver with the speed of light
(A little bit of love and joy)
Everything you do bears a will
And a why and a wherefore
(A little bit of love and joy)
In each and every soul
Lies a man and very soon
He'll deceive and discover
But even till the end of his life
He'll bring a little love

[Verse 4]
I reign with my left hand
I rule with my right
I'm lord of all darkness
I'm Queen of the night
I've got the power
Now do the march of the black Queen
My life is in your hands, I'll fo and I'll fie
I'll be what you make me
I'll do what you like
I'll be a bad boy, I'll be your bad boy
I'll do the march of the Black Queen
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 5]
Walking true to style
She's vulgar, 'buse, and vile
Fie-fo the Black Queen tattoos all her pies
She boils and she bakes
And she never dots her i's
(She's our leader)

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Forget your singalongs and your lullabies
Surrender to the city of the fireflies
Dance with the devil in beat with the band
To hell with all of you hand-in-hand
But now it's time to be gone
(La la la la forever) forever
Ah ah ah ah ah

[Segue to "Funny How Love Is"]

[Chorus]
Funny how love is everywhere
Just look and see
Funny how love is anywhere
You're bound to be
Funny how love is every song
In every key
Funny how love is coming home
In time for tea

[Post-Chorus]
Funny, funny, funny

[Verse 1]
Funny how love is the end of lies
When the truth begins
Tomorrow comes, tomorrow brings
Tomorrow brings love
In the shape of things
That's what love is
That's what love is

[Chorus]
Funny how love  can break
Your heart so suddenly
Funny how love came tumbling down
With Adam and Eve
Funny how love is running
Wild and feeling free
Funny how love is coming home
In time for tea

[Post-Chorus]
Funny, funny, funny

[Verse 2]
From the earth below
To the heavens above
That's how far and funny is love
At any time, anywhere
If you gotta make love
Do it everywhere
That's what love is
That's what love is

[Chorus]
Funny how love is everywhere
Just look and see
Funny how love is anywhere
You're bound to be
Funny how love is every song
In every key
Funny how love is when you
Gotta hurry home 'cause you're late for tea

[Post-Chorus]
Funny, funny, funny how love is

[Outro]
Tomorrow comes, tomorrow brings
Tomorrow brings love
In the shape of things
At any time, anywhere
If you got to make love do it everywhere
That's what love is
That's what love is

[Intro]
Well, she's gone, dear
Gone this morning, mmh yeah
Ow, see what a fool I've been - oh Lord, I say
What a fool I've been
Yes, I did

[Verse 1]
Too much
Didn't leave me-me no letter, didn't leave no warning
You naughty thing, you
Ooh - well I guess I am to blame oh lord
I guess I'm all to blame - see you later, sailor boy
Child, right now you take it

[Verse 2]
Hope my little dog ain’t too hungry
No, no, he just kept on barking, the vicious thing
Just don't seem the same, oh, no, no
It just, oh tantrums, it don't feel the same
Ooh, see you later
Now hit it, like that
Coming on strong

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Oh, well I got so lonely
Went and told my neighbour
She said "Ah ooh ooh ooh ooh"
Oh Lord
What a fool I've been
And she told what to do
She said "Go home!"

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Well she's gone - gone this morning
See what a fool I've been, oh lord
What a... foo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool... I've been

Thank you

[Verse 1]
Happy little day, Jimmy went away
Met his little Jenny on a public holiday
A happy pair they made, so decorously laid
'Neath the gay illuminations all along the promenade
It's so good to know there's still a little magic in the air
I'll weave my spell

[Verse 2]
"Jenny will you stay, tarry with me, pray
Nothing e'er need come between us
Tell me, love, what do you say?"
"Oh no, I must away to my Mum in disarray
If my mother should discover
How I spent my holiday"
It would be of small avail to talk of magic in the air
I'll say farewell

[Chorus]
Oh, Rock of Ages
Do not crumble, love is breathing still
Oh, Lady Moon, shine down
A little people magic if you will

[Instrumental Guitar Break]

[Verse 3]
Jenny pines away, writes a letter everyday
"We must ever be together
Nothing can my love erase"
Oh no, I'm compromised, I must apologize
If my lady should discover
How I spent my holidays
Ooh
Ooh, ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
My new purple shoes
Been amazin' the people next door
And my rock 'n roll 45's
Been enragin' the folks on the lower floor
I've got a way with the girls on my block
Try my best be a real individual
And when we go down to Smokies and rock
They line up like it's some kind of ritual

[Chorus]
Ooh, give me a good guitar
And you can say that my hair's a disgrace
Or just find me an open car
I'll make the speed of light outta this place

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 2]
I like the good things in life
But most of the best things ain't free
And this same situation, just cuts like a knife
When you're young
And you're poor, and you're crazy
(Young and you're crazy)
(Young and you're crazy)
(Young and you're crazy)
Young and you're crazy!

[Chorus]
Ooh, give me a good guitar
And you can say that my hair's a disgrace
Or just find me an open car
I'll make the speed of light outta this place

[Instrumental intro]

[Verse 1]
"Dislocate your spine
If you don't sign" he says
"I'll have you seeing double"
Mesmerize you when he's tongue-tied
Simply with those eyes
Synchronize your minds and see
The beast within him rise

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't look back
Don't look back
It's a rip-off

[Chorus]
Flick of the wrist
And you're dead baby
Blow him a kiss and you're mad
Flick of the wrist
He'll eat your heart out
A dig in the ribs
And then a kick in the head
He's taken an arm and taken a leg
All this time honey
Baby you've been had

[Verse 2]
"Intoxicate your brain
With what I'm saying
If not you'll lie in knee-deep trouble
Prostitute yourself," he says
"Castrate your human pride
Sacrifice your leisure days
Let me squeeze you till you've dried"

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't look back
Don't look back
It's a rip-off

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Work my fingers to my bones
I scream with pain
I still make no impression
Seduce you with his money-make machine
Cross-collateralize
(Big-time money, money)
Reduce you to a Muzak-fake machine
Then the last goodbye
It's a rip-off

[Chorus]
Flick of the wrist, and you're dead baby
Blow him a kiss and you're mad
Flick of the wrist - he'll eat your heart out
A dig in the ribs and then a kick in the head
He's taken an arm and taken a leg
All this time honey
Baby you've been had

[Intro]
Baby, you've been had

[Verse 1]
I am forever searching high and low
But why does everybody tell me no?
Neptune of the seas (seas)
Have answer for me, please (please)
The lily of the valley (valley)
Doesn't know

[Bridge]
I lie in wait with open eyes (oo-ooh)
I carry on through
Stormy skies (oo-oo-oo-ooh)
I follow every course
(Follow every course)
My kingdom for a horse
(Kingdom for a horse)
But each time I grow old (oo-oo-oo-wah)
Serpent of the Nile (Nile)
Relieve me for a while (while)
And cast me from your spell
And let me go (oo-oo-ooh, let me go)

[Verse 2]
Messenger from Seven Seas
Has flown (ooh, oo-oo-ooh)
To tell the King of Rhye
He's lost his throne (Aah)
Wars will never cease (cease)
Is there time enough for peace? (Peace)
But the lily of the valley (valley)
Doesn't know

[Outro]

[Intro]
Here I stand
Look around, around
Around, around, around
But you won't see me
Now I'm here (now I'm here)
Now I'm there (now I'm there)
I'm just a, just a new man
Yes, you made me live again

[Verse 1]
A baby I was when you took my hand
And the light of the night burned bright
And the people all stared
Didn't understand
But you knew my name on sight

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever came of you and me
America's new bride to be
Ooh, don't worry, baby
I'm safe and sound

[Chorus]
Down in the dungeon just Peaches and me
Don't I love her so?
Yeah, she made me live again
Yeah

[Verse 2]
A thin moon me in a smoke-screen sky
Where the beams of your love-light chase
Don't move, don't speak, don't feel no pain
With the rain running down my face

[Pre-Chorus]
Your matches still light up the sky
And many a tear lives on in my eye

[Chorus]
Down in the city just Hoople and me
Don't I love him so?
Ooh, don't I love him so?

[Guitar solo]

[Bridge]
Whatever comes of you and me
I'd love to leave my memory with you

[Verse 3]
Now I'm here (now I'm here)
Think I'll stay around, around (think I'll stay around, around)
Around, around, around, around (around, around, around, around)
Down in the city just as you and me (down in the city just as you and me)
Don't I love you so

[Outro]
Go, go, go, little queenie!

[Intro]
Leave it in the lap of the Gods

[Verse]
I live my life for you
Think all my thoughts
With you and only you
Anything you ask I do, for you
I touch your lips with mine
But in the end, I leave it to the lords
Leave it in the lap of the Gods
What more can I do?

[Chorus]
Leave it in the lap of the Gods
(I leave it to you)
Leave it in the lap of the Gods
Leave it in the lap of the Gods
(I want you to)
Leave it in the lap of the Gods
Leave it in the lap of the Gods
Leave it in the lap of the Gods

[Outro]
Lap of the Gods
Lap of the Gods
Lap of the Gods
Lap of the Gods
Lap of the Gods
Lap of the Gods
Lap of the Gods

[Instrumental intro]

[Verse 1]
Sleeping very soundly
On a Saturday morning
I was dreaming I was Al Capone
There's a rumour going round
Gotta clear out of town
Yeah, I'm smelling like a dry fish bone
Here come the law
Gonna break down the door
Gonna carry me away once more
Never, never, never get it any more
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor

[Chorus]
Crazy (stone cold crazy, you know)

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Rainy afternoon I gotta blow a typhoon
And I'm playing on my slide trombone
Anymore, anymore, cannot take it anymore
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor

[Chorus]
Crazy (stone cold crazy, you know)

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Walking down the street
Shooting people that I meet
With my rubber tommy water gun
Here come the deputy
He's gonna come and getta me
I gotta get me get up and run
They got the sirens loose
I ran right outta juice
They're going to put me in a cell
If I can't go to heaven
Will they let me go to hell?

[Chorus]
Crazy (stone cold crazy, you know)

[Outro]
Ow!

[Verse]
So dear friends your love is gone
Only tears to dwell upon
I dare not say as the wind must blow
So a love is lost, a love is won
Go to sleep and dream again
Soon your hopes will rise and then
From all this gloom life can start anew
And there'll be no crying soon

[Intro]
Don't you misfire
Fill me up with the desire
To carry on

[Verse 1]
Don't you know, honey
That love's a game?
It's always hit or miss
So take your aim
Got to hold on tight
Shoot me out of sight

[Chorus]
Don't you misfire, fill me up
With the desire to carry on
Don't you misfire, fill me up
With the desire to carry on

[Verse 2]
Your gun is loaded
And pointing my way
There's only one bullet
So don't delay
Got to time it right
Fire me through the night

[Outro]
Come on, take a shot
Fire me higher
Don't you miss this time
Please don't misfire
Misfire

[Chorus]
Bring back, bring back
Bring back that Leroy Brown (yeah)
Bring back, bring back
Gotta bring that Leroy Brown (back)

[Verse 1]
Bet your bottom dollar bill
You're a playboy (yeah, yeah!)
Daddy cool, with a ninety dollar smile
(Woo, woo, woo, woo-yeah)
Took my money out of gratitude
And he get right out of town (well)
I got to getty up
Steady up, shoot him down
Got to hit that latitude (babe)

[Chorus]
Bring back, bring back
Bring back that Leroy Brown (yeah)
Bring back, bring back
Gotta bring back Leroy Brown (yeah)

[Verse 2]
Big, bad Leroy Brown
He got no common sense (no, no)
He got no brains
But he sure got a lot of style
Can't stand no more in this, here, jail
I got to rid myself of this sentence
Got to get out the heat
Step into the shade
Got to get me there
Dead or alive (babe)

[Guitar Solo]
(Woo, woo, big, bad Leroy, woo, woo)
(Woo, woo, big, bad Leroy Brown)

(Well)

[Chorus]
Bring back, bring back
Bring back that Leroy Brown
Bring back, bring back
Gotta bring back Leroy Brown (back)

[Verse 3]
Big mama Lulu Belle
She had a nervous breakdown
(She had a nervous breakdown)
Leroy's taken her honey Chile away
But she met him down
At the station (ooo-hoo)
Put a shotgun to his head
And unless I be mistaken (mistaken)
This is what she said
"Big bad big boy, big bad Leroy Brown
I'm gonna get that cutie pie"

[Chorus]
Bring back, bring back
Bring back that Leroy Brown (yeah)

[Verse 4]
Big bad caused a mighty
Fine sensation (yeah, yeah)
Gone and got himself elected President
(We want Leroy for President)
Next time you got to
Hit a bitty baddy weather
This time like a shimmy shammy leather
He's a big boy, bad boy Leroy
I don't care where you get him from

[Outro]
Bring that big, bad Leroy back
Want him back

[Verse]
The machine of a dream
Such a clean machine
With the pistons a pumping
And the hubcaps all gleam

[Pre-Chorus]
When I'm holding your wheel
All I hear is your gear
When my hand's on your grease gun
Oh it's like a disease, son

[Chorus]
I'm in love with my car
Got to feel for my automobile
Get a grip on my boy racer roll bar
Such a thrill when your radials squeal

[Bridge]
Told my girl I'll have to forget her
Rather buy me a new carburetor
So she made tracks
Saying this is the end now
Cars don't talk back
They're just four-wheeled friends, now

[Pre-Chorus]
When I'm holding your wheel
All I hear is your gear
When I'm cruising in overdrive
Don't have to listen
To no run-of-the-mill talk jive

[Chorus]
I'm in love with my car
(Ooh, I'm in love with my car)
Got to feel for my automobile (Ooh)
I'm in love with my car
(Ooh, I'm in love with my car)
String back gloves
In my automolove (Ooh)

[Verse 1]
I love, she makes me
She is my heart
She is my love
She is my love

[Verse 2]
I know, I'm jealous of her
She makes me need
She is my love
She is my love

[Bridge]
Who knows who she'll make me
As I lie in her cocoon
But the world will surely heal my ill's
I'm warm and terrified
She makes me so

[Verse 3]
I know the day I leave her
I'll love her still
She is my love
She is my love

[Bridge]
Who knows where my dreams will end
I'll follow as they grow
But the world will know
How long I'll take
And if I'm very slow
She makes me so

[Outro]
She is my love
She is my love

[Verse 1]
It's so easy, but I can't do it
So risky, but I gotta chance it
It's so funny, there's nothing to laugh about
My money, that's all you wanna talk about
I can see what you want me to be
But I'm no fool

[Chorus]
It's in the lap of the Gods
Whoa, whoa, la-la-la, whoa
I can see what you want me to be
But I'm no fool

[Verse 2]
No beginning, there's no ending
There's no meaning in my pretending
Believe me, life goes on and on and
Forgive me when I ask you, "Where do I belong?"
You say, "I (You can do it) can't (You can do it)
(You can go and set him free) Set you free from me"
But that's not true

[Chorus]
It's in the lap of the Gods
Whoa, whoa, la-la-la, whoa
I can see what you want me to be
But I'm no fool
It's in the lap of the Gods

[Outro]
Whoa, whoa, la-la-la, whoa
Whoa, whoa, la-la, wah, wah, ooh
But that's not true
It's in the lap of the Gods
Whoa, whoa, la-la-la, whoa
Whoa, whoa, la-la, wah, wah, ooh
But I'm no fool
It's in the lap of the Gods
Whoa, whoa, la-la-la, whoa
Whoa, whoa, la-la, wah, wah, ooh
It's in the lap of the Gods
Whoa, whoa, la-la-la, whoa
Whoa, whoa, la-la, wah, wah, ooh
But I'm no fool
It's in the lap of the Gods
Whoa, whoa, la-la-la, whoa
Whoa, whoa, la-la, wah, wah, ooh

[Instrumental intro]

[Verse 1]
In the year of '39
Assembled here the Volunteers
In the days when lands were few
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
Sweetest sight ever seen
And the night followed day
And the storytellers say
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day
Sailed across the milky seas
Ne'er looked back, never feared, never cried

[Chorus]
Don't you hear my call?
Though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you?
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
In the year of '39
Came a ship in from the blue
The Volunteers came home that day
And they bring good news
Of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavily weigh
For the Earth is old and grey
Little darlin', we'll away
But my love this cannot be
For so many years are gone
Though I'm older but a year
Your mother's eyes from your eyes cry to me

[Chorus]
Don't you hear my call?
Though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you?
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew

[Outro]
Don't you hear my call?
Though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you?
All your letters in the sand
Cannot heal me like your hand
For my life still ahead, pity me

[Intro]
Ooh, I like it

[Verse 1]
You call me up and treat me like a dog
You call me up and tear me up inside
You've got me on a lead
Ooh, you bring me down, you shout around
You don't believe that I'm alone
Ooh, you don't believe me

[Chorus]
Sweet lady
Sweet lady
Sweet lady (Sweet lady)
Ooh, stay sweet

[Verse 2]
You call me up and feed me all the lines
You call me sweet like I'm some kind of cheese
Waiting on the shelf
You eat me up, you hold me down
I'm just a fool to make you a home
Ooh, you really do and you say

[Chorus]
Sweet lady (Sweet lady)
Sweet lady (Sweet lady)
Sweet lady (Ooh, come on)
Stay sweet

[Bridge]
My sweet lady
Though it seems like we wait forever
Stay sweet, baby
Believe and we've got everything we need
(Got everything we need)

[Chorus]
Sweet lady
Sweet lady
Sweet lady (Yeah, ooh, ooh)
Stay sweet (Stay sweet)

[Outro]
Oh, runaway
Come on
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Sweet lady
Woo!

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Seaside, whenever you stroll along with me
I'm merely contemplating what you feel inside
Meanwhile, I ask you to be my Clementine
You say you will if you could, but you can't
I love you madly
Let my imagination run away with you gladly
A brand new angle, highly commendable
Seaside rendezvous

[Verse 2]
I feel so romantic, can we do it again?
Can we do it again sometime? (Ooh, I'd like that)
Fantastic, c'est la vie mesdames et messieurs
And at the peak of the season
The Mediterranean
This time of year, it's so fashionable

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
I feel like dancing in the rain
Can I have a volunteer?
(Just keep right on dancing)
What a damn jolly good idea
It's such a jollification, as a matter of fact
So très charmant, my dear

[Verse 4]
Underneath the moonlight
Together we'll sail across the sea
Reminiscing every night
Meantime (And in the meantime, baby)
I ask you to be my valentine
You say you'd have to tell your daddy if you can
I'll be your Valentino
We'll ride upon an omnibus and then the casino
Get a new facial, start a sensational

[Outro]
Seaside rendezvous, so adorable
Seaside rendezvous, ooh-ooh
Seaside rendezvous, give us a kiss

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Love of my life, you've hurt me
You've broken my heart
And now you leave me

[Chorus]
Love of my life, can't you see?
Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know
What it means to me

[Verse 2]
Love of my life, don't leave me
You've taken my love (all my love)
And now desert me

[Chorus]
Love of my life, can't you see?
(Please bring it back, back) Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know what it means to me

[Bridge]
You will remember when this is blown over
And everything's all by the way
When I grow older
I will be there at your side
To remind you how
I still love you (I still love you)

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Back, hurry back
Please bring it back home to me
Because you don't know
What it means to me

[Outro]
Love of my life
Love of my life
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Take good care of what you've got
My father said to me
As he puffed his pipe and Baby B
He dandled on his knee
Don't fool with fools who'll turn away
Keep all good company
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
Take care of those you call your own
And keep good company

[Verse 2]
Soon I grew and happy too
My very good friends and me
We'd play all day with Sally J
The girl from number four
And very soon I begged her
Won't you keep me company?
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
Oh, marry me for evermore
We'll be good company

[Bridge]
Now marriage is an institution sure
My wife and I, our needs and nothing more
All my friends by a year
By and by disappear
But we're safe enough behind our door

[Verse 3]
I flourished in my humble trade
My reputation grew
The work devoured my waking hours
But when my time was through
Reward of all my efforts
My own limited company

[Chorus]
I hardly noticed Sally
As we parted company

[Bridge]
All through the years
In the end, it appears
There was never really anyone but me

[Verse 4]
Now I'm old, I puff my pipe
But no one's there to see
I ponder on the lesson of
My life's insanity

[Chorus]
Take care of those you call your own
And keep good company

[Guitar Jazz Band Section]

[Intro]
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Get your party gown, get your pigtail down
Get your heart beating, baby
Got my timing right, got my act all tight
It's gotta be tonight
My little school babe
Your momma says you don't
And your daddy says you won't
And I'm boiling up inside
There is no way I'm gonna lose out this time
Oh, no

[Chorus]
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Lock your daddy out of doors
I don't need him nosing around
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Give me all your love tonight

[Verse 2]
"You're such a dirty louse
Go get out of my house"
That's all I ever get from your
Your family ties, in fact
I don't think I ever heard
A single little civil word from those guys
But you know I don't give a light
I'm gonna make out all right
I've got a sweetheart in hand
To put a stop to all that
Snipin' and grousin' goin' on all night

[Chorus]
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Take your little brother
Swimming with a brick, that's alright
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Or you ain't no friend of mine

[Guitar Solo]
Bad guy

[Verse 3]
Your mommy and your daddy
Are gonna plague me till I die
They can't understand it
I'm just a peace loving guy

[Chorus]
Tie your mother down
Tie your mother down
Get that big, big, big, big, big
Big daddy out the door
Tie your mother down
Yeah, tie your mother down
Give me all your love tonight
All your love tonight

[Outro]
Give me every inch of your love
Gotta get my timing right
All your love tonight, yeah
All your love
Tonight

[Intro]
Ooh
Ooh, take it, take it all away
Ooh
Ooh, take my breath away (ooh)
Ooh
Ooh, you-ou-ou-ou
Take my breath away

[Verse 1]
Look into my eyes and you'll see
I'm the only one
You've captured my love
Stolen my heart, changed my life
Every time you make a move
You destroy my mind
And the way you touch
I lose control and shiver deep inside

[Refrain]
You take my breath away

[Verse 2]
You can reduce me to tears
With a single sigh
(Please don't cry anymore)
Every breath that you take
Any sound that you make
Is a whisper in my ear
I could give up all my life
For just one kiss
I would surely die
If you dismiss me from your love

[Refrain]
You take my breath away

[Bridge]
So please don't go
Don't leave me here all by myself
I get ever so lonely from time to time
I will find you anywhere you go
I'll be right behind you (ooh)
Right until the ends of the earth (aah)
I'll get no sleep
Till I find you (get no sleep)
And tell you that you just

[Refrain]
Take my breath away

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
I will find you anywhere you go (ooh)
Right until the ends of the earth (aah)
I'll get no sleep
Till I find you (get no sleep)
To tell you when I've found you
I love you

[Outro]
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath
Ooh, take my breath away
Ooh, take my breath away
Ooh, take my breath away
Ooh, take my breath away

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
You might believe in heaven
I would not care to say
For every star in heaven
There's a sad soul here today

[Pre-Chorus]
Wake up in the morning with a good face
Stare at the moon all day
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase
Does anyone care anyway
For all the prayers in heaven
So much of life's this way

[Chorus]
Did we leave our way behind us
Such a long, long way behind us
Who knows when
Now who knows where
Where the light of day will find us?
Look for the day

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Take heart, my friend, we love you
Though it seems like you're alone
A million lights above you
Smile down upon your home

[Pre-Chorus]
Hurry, put your troubles in a suitcase
Come let the new child play
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase
I'm leaving here, I'm long away
For all the stars in heaven
I would not live, I could not live this way

[Chorus]
Did we leave our way behind us?
Such a long, long way behind us
Leave it for some hopeless lane

[Outro]
Such a long, long way
Such a long, long way
Such a long, long away
I'm looking for, looking for that day

[Instrumental intro]

[Verse 1]
Bring out the charge of the love brigade
There is spring in the air once again
Drink to the sound of the song parade
There is music and love everywhere
Give a little love to me (I want it)
Take a little love from me
I wanna share it with you
I feel like a millionaire

[Verse 2]
Once we were mad, we were happy
We spent all our days
Holding hands together
Do you remember, my love?
How we danced and played
In the rain we laid
How we wish that we could stay there
Forever and ever

[Verse 3]
Now I am sad, you are so far away
I sit counting the hours day by day
Come back to me
How I long for your love
Come back to me
Be happy like we used to be

[Guitar solo 1]

[Bridge]
Come back, come back to me
Come back, come back to me
Oh come back to me, oh my love
How I long for your love
Won't you come back to me, yeah

[Guitar solo 2]

[Bridge]
My fine friend, take me with you
And love me forever
My fine friend, forever (forever)

[Outro]
Bring out the charge of the love brigade
There is spring in the air once again
Drink to the sound of the song parade
There is music and love everywhere
Give a little love to me (I want it)
Take a little love from me
I wanna share it with you
Come back, come back to me
You make me feel like a millionaire

[Intro]
Ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
Music is playing in the darkness
And a lantern goes swinging by
Shadows flickering, my heart's jittering
Just you and I
Not tonight, come tomorrow
When everything's sunny
And bright (sunny and bright)
No, no, no, come tomorrow
Cause then we'll be
Waiting for the moonlight

[Chorus]
We'll go walking in the moonlight
Walking in the moonlight

[Verse 2]
Laughter ringing in the darkness
People drinking for days gone by
Time don't mean a thing
When you're by my side
Please stay a while

[Bridge]
Ooh, you know I never could
Foresee the future years
You know I never could see
Where life was leading me
But will we be together forever?
What will be my love?
Can't you see that I just don't know
Don't know

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
No, no, not tonight, come tomorrow
When everything's gonna
Be alright (sunny and bright)
Wait and see if tomorrow
Will be as happy
As we're feeling tonight

[Chorus]
We'll go walking
In the moonlight (Oh, we'll be happy)
Walking in the moonlight

[Verse 4]
I can hear the music in the darkness
Floating softly to where we lie
No more questions now
Let's enjoy tonight
Just you and I
Ooh, just you and I

[Outro]
Mm, just you and I
Can't you see that
We gotta be together, be together
Just you and I, just you and I
No more questions, just you and I

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I'm a simple man
With a simple name
From this soil, my people came
In this soil remain
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
And we made us our shoes
And we trod soft on the land
But the immigrant built roads
On our blood and sand
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
White man, white man
Don't you see the light
Behind your blackened skies
(White man, white man)
You took away the sights
To blind my simple eyes, yeah
(White man, white man)
Where you gonna hide
From the hell you've made?

[Verse 3]
Oh, the red man knows war
With his hands and his knives
On the Bible you swore
Fought your battle with lies
Oh yeah

[Verse 4]
Leave my body in shame
Leave my soul in disgrace
But by every God's name
Say your prayers for your race
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
(White man, white man)
Our country was green
And all our rivers wide
White man, white man
You came with a gun
And soon our children died
White man, white man
Don't you give a light
For the blood you've shed?
Uuuh yeah

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Oh-uh-oh
(White man, white man)
White man
(White man, white man)
Ooh, white man
You fought your battle with lies, yeah
(White man, white man)
On and on, on and on
But we weren't too civilized, yeah
(White man, white man)
Look around you
Take a look around
Every skin and bone
Yeah, I'll getcha, I'll getcha, yeah

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
What is left of your dream?
Just the words on your stone
A man who learned how to teach
Then forgot how to learn
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
It's the sad-eyed goodbye
Yesterday moments I remember
It's the bleak street
Weak-kneed partings I recall

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the mistier mist, the hazier days
The brighter sun and the easier lays

[Chorus]
There's all the more reason
For laughing and crying
When you're younger
And life isn't too hard at all

[Verse 2]
It's the fantastic drowse
Of the afternoon Sundays
That bored you to rages of tears
The unending pleadings
To waste all your good times
In thoughts of your middle-aged years

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a vertical hold
All the things that you're told
For the everyday hero
It all turns to zero

[Chorus]
And there's all the more reason
For living or dying
When you're young
And your troubles are all very small

[Bridge]
Out here on the street
We'd gather and meet
And scuff up the sidewalk
With endlessly restless feet
And half of the time
We'd broaden our minds more
In the pool hall than we did
In the school hall
With the downtown
Chewing-gum bums
Watching the nightlife
The lights and the fun

[Verse 3]
Never wanted to be the boy next door
Always thought I'd be something more
But it ain’t easy for a smalltown boy
It ain’t easy at all

[Outro]
Thinkin' it right, doin' it wrong
It's easier from an armchair
Waves of alternatives wash at my sleepiness
Have my eggs poached
For breakfast I guess
I think I'll be Clint Eastwood
Oh no, Jimi Hendrix, he was good
Let's try William the Conqueror
Now who else do I like?
Brian May

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
She came without a farthing
A babe without a name
So much ado 'bout nothing
Is what she'd try to say
So much ado my lover
So many games we played
Through every fleeted summer
Through every precious day

[Chorus]
All dead, all dead
All the dreams we had
And I wonder why I still live on
All dead, all dead
And alone I'm spared
My sweeter half instead
All dead and gone
All dead

[Chorus]
All dead, all dead
At the rainbow's end
And still I hear her own sweet song
All dead, all dead
Take me back again
You know my little friend's
All dead and gone

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
Her ways are always with me
I wander all the while
But please you must forgive me
I am old but still a child

[Chorus]
All dead, all dead
But I should not grieve
In time it comes to everyone
All dead, all dead
But in hope I breathe
Of course I don't believe
You're dead and gone

[Outro]
All dead and gone

[Verse 1]
When I'm gone
No need to wonder
If I ever think of you
The same moon shines
The same wind blows
For both of us
And time is but a paper moon
Be not gone

[Verse 2]
Though I'm gone
It's just as though I hold
The flower that touches you
A new life grows, the blossom knows
There's no one else
Could warm my heart as much as you
Be not gone

[English Chorus]
Let us cling together as the years go by
Oh my love, my love
In the quiet of the night
Let our candle always burn
Let us never lose
The lessons we have learned

[Japanese Chorus]
Teo Torriate konomama iko
Aisuruhito yo
Shizukana yoi ni
Hikario tomoshi
Itoshiki oshieo idaki

[Verse 3]
Hear my song
Still, think of me the way
You've come to think of me
The nights grow long
But dreams live on
Just close your pretty eyes
And you can be with me
Dream on

[Japanese Chorus]
Teo Torriate konomama iko
Aisuruhito yo
Shizukana yoi ni
Hikario tomoshi
Itoshiki oshieo idaki

[Bridge]
When I'm gone
They'll say we're all fools
And we don't understand
Oh, be strong
Don't turn your heart
We're all, you're all
For all, for always

[English Chorus]
Let us cling together as the years go by
Oh my love, my love
In the quiet of the night
Let our candle always burn
Let us never lose
The lessons we have learned

[Instrumental outro]

[Verse 1]
Well, you're just seventeen
All you wanna do is disappear
You know what I mean
There's a lot of space between our ears
The way that you touch don't feel nothing

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
It was the DNA
Hey, hey, hey, hey
That made me this way
Do you know, do you know, do you know
Just how I feel?
Do you know, do you know, do you know
Just how I feel?

[Chorus]
Sheer heart attack
Sheer heart attack
Real cardiac
I feel so
Inar-inar-inar-inar-inar-inar-inar-inarticulate

[Verse 2]
Gotta feeling, gotta feeling
Gotta feeling, like I'm paralyzed
It ain't no, it ain't no
It ain't no, it ain't no surprise
Turn on the TV
Let it drip right down in your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
It was the DNA
Hey, hey, hey, hey
That made me this way
Do you know, do you know, do you know
Just how I feel?
Do you know, do you know, do you know
Just how I feel?

[Chorus]
Sheer heart attack
Sheer heart attack
Real cardiac
I feel so inar-inar-inar-inar
Inar-inar-inar-inarticulate

[Bridge]
Just how I feel
Do you know, do you know, do you know
Just how I feel?

[Instrumental break]

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you know, do you know, do you know
Just how I feel?
Do you know, do you know, do you know
Just how I feel?

[Chorus]
Sheer heart attack
Sheer heart attack
Real cardiac

[Verse 1]
Sammy was low, just watching the show
Over and over again
Knew it was time, he'd made up his mind
To leave his dead life behind
His boss said to him
"Boy, you'd better begin
To get those crazy notions
Right out of your head
Sammy, who do you think that you are?
You should've been sweeping
Up the Emerald Bar"

[Chorus]
Spread your wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Pull yourself together
'Cause you know you should do better
That's because you're a free man

[Bridge]
He spends his evenings
Alone in his hotel room
Keeping his thoughts to himself
He'd be leaving soon
Wishing he was miles and miles away
Nothing in this world
Nothing would make him stay

[Verse 2]
Since he was small, had no luck at all
Nothing came easy to him
Now it was time, he'd made up his mind
"This could be my last chance"
His boss said to him
"Now listen, boy! You're always dreaming
You've got no real ambition
You won't get very far
Sammy boy, don't you know who you are?
Why can't you be happy
At the Emerald Bar?"

[Chorus]
So honey, spread your wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Pull yourself together
'Cause you know you should do better
That's because you're a free man

[Outro]
Come on, honey
Fly with me

[Instrumental intro]

[Verse 1]
Hey you, boy, hey you
Hey you boy, think that you
Know what you're doin'?
You think you're gonna
Set things to rights
You're just another picture
On a teenage wall
You're just another sucker
Ready for a fall

[Chorus]
You gotta fight from the inside
Attack from the rear
Fight from the inside
You can't win with your hands tied
Fight from the inside
Ooh, ooh, aah!
Fight from the inside
Right down the line

[Verse 2]
Hey you, boy, hey you
Hey you boy, think that you
Know what you're doin'?
You think that out
In the streets is all free
You're just another money-spinner tool
You're just another, fool

[Chorus]
You gotta fight from the inside
Attack from the rear
Fight from the inside
You can't win with your hands tied
Fight from the inside
Ooh, ooh, Aah!
Fight from the inside
Right down the line

[Outro]
Right down the line
Right down the line

[Intro]

[Chorus]
Get down, make love
Get down, make love
Get down, make love
Get down, make love

[Verse 1]
You take my body, I give you heat
You say you're hungry, I give you meat
I suck your mind, you blow my head
Make love (Make love) inside your bed
Everybody get down, make love

[Chorus]
Get down, make love
Get down, make love
Get down, make love

[Bridge]
Every time I get hot
You wanna cool down
Every time I get high
You say you wanna come down
You say it's enough
In fact, it's too much
Every time I get a
Get down, get down
Get down, make love

[Verse 2]
(Get down) I can squeeze
(Make love) you can shake me
(Get down) I can feel
(Make love) when you break me
(Get down) Come on so heavy (make love)
(Get down) when you take me
(Make love) You make love
You make love
(Get down) you make love
You make love
(Make love) You can make everybody

[Chorus]
Get down, make love
Get down, make love

[Bridge]
Every time I get high
You wanna come down
Every time I get hot
You say you want to cool down
You say it's enough
In fact, it's too much
Every time I wanna
Get down, get down, get down

[Instrumental break]
Make love, make love
Make love, make love
Aah!

[Chorus]
Get down, make love
Get down, make love
Get down, make love
Get down, make love

[Bridge]
Every time I get hot
You wanna cool down
Every time I get high
You say you wanna come down
You say it's enough
In fact, it's just too much
Every time I wanna
Get down, get down
Get down, make love

[Intro]
One, two, three

[Verse 1]
I was nothin' but a city boy
My trumpet was my only toy
I've been blowin' my horn
Since I knew I was born
But there ain’t nobody wants to know

[Chorus]
I've been sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I may get hungry
But I sure don't wanna go home

[Verse 2]
So 'round the corner comes a limousine
And the biggest grin I ever seen
Hey, sonny, won't you sign
Right along the dotted line?
What you sayin', are you playin'
Sure you don't mean me?

[Chorus]
I've been sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I may get hungry
But I sure don't wanna go home
Now, I'll tell you what happened

[Bridge]
They took me to a room without a table
They said "blow your trumpet into here"
I played around as well as I was able
And soon we had the record of the year

[Verse 3]
I was a legend all through the land
I was blowin' to a million fans
Nothin' was a-missin'
All the people wanna listen
You'd have thought I was a happy man

[Chorus]
And I was sleepin' like a princess
Never touch the road
I don't get hungry
And I sure don't want to go home
Have to have some fun

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Now they tell me
That I ain’t so fashion-able
And that I owe the man
A million bucks a year
So I told 'em
Where to stick the fancy label
It's just me and the road from here, yeah
Back to playin' and layin'
I'm back on the game

[Chorus]
I'm sleepin' on the sidewalk
Rollin' down the road
I sure get hungry
And I sure do wanna go home

[Outro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I make it half past six, you come at seven
Always try to keep me hanging round
You little spoilt thing
Girl, you kept me waiting
Never contemplating my point of view

[Chorus]
This comes as no surprise
I'm a fool for I believed your lies
But now I've seen through your disguise
Who needs, well, I don't need
Who needs you?

[Verse 2]
Oh, I believed you
Went on my knees to you
How I trusted you
But you turned me down
But it's dog eat dog in this rat race
And it leaves you bleeding
Lying flat on your face
Reaching out reaching out
For a helping hand
(Where is that helping hand?)

[Bridge]
Oh, muchachos
I like it, I like it
Well, I don't need you

[Verse 3]
How I was pushed around
Don't let it get you down
You walked all over me
But don't you ever give in
Taking one step forward
Slipping two steps back
There's an empty feeling
That you can't forget
Reaching out for a helping hand

[Verse 4]
When I met you
You were always charming
Couldn't sleep at night 'till you were mine
You were, oh, so, so sophisticated
Never interested in what I'd say

[Chorus]
I had to swallow my pride
So naïve you took me for a ride
But now I'm the one to decide
Who needs, well, I don't need
Who needs you?

[Outro]

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
You say you love me
And I hardly know your name
And if I say I love you in the candlelight
There's no one but myself to blame
But there's something inside
That's turning my mind away
Oh, how I could love you
If I could let you stay

[Chorus]
(It's late) When I'm bleeding deep inside
(It's late) Ooh, is it just my sickly pride?
(Too late) Even now
The feeling seems to steal away
(So late) Though I'm crying
I can't help but hear you say
It's late, it's late, it's late, but not too late

[Verse 2]
The way you love me
Is the sweetest love around
But after all this time, the more I'm trying
The more I seem to let you down
Now you tell me you're leaving
And I just can't believe it's true
Oh, you know that I can love you
Though I know I can't be true
Oh, you made me love you
Don't tell me that we're through

[Chorus]
(It's late) But it's driving me so mad
(It's late) Yes, I know
But don't try to tell me that it's
(Too late) Save our love
You can't turn out the lights
(So late) I've been wrong
But I'll learn to be right
It's late, it's late, it's late, but not too late

[Bridge]
I've been so long, you've been so long
We've been so long trying to work it out
I ain't got long, you ain't got long
We gotta know what this life is all about

[Guitar Solo]
Tell me
Try to work it out, yeah
Woo! Ooh
Too late, yeah
Too late, much too late
Ah!

[Verse 3]
You're staring at me
With suspicion in your eye
You say what game are you playing?
What's this that you're saying?
I know that I can't reply
If I take you tonight
Is it making my life a lie?
Oh, you make me wonder
Did I live my life right?

[Chorus]
(It's late) Ooh, but it's time to set me free
(It's late) Ooh yes, I know
But there's no way it has to be
(Too late) So let the fire
Take our bodies this night
(So late) Let the waters
Take our guilt in the tide, now
It's late, it's late, it's late, it's late
It's late, it's late, it's late

[Outro]
Oh, it's all too late
Whoa, oh, it's too late
Come on!
I'm late, too late, oh yeah
Whoa!

[Instrumental intro]

[Verse 1]
Another party's over
And I'm left cold sober
My baby left me for somebody new
I don't wanna talk about it
Want to forget about it
Wanna be intoxicated
With that special brew

[Bridge]
So come and get me, let me
Get in that sinking feeling
That says my heart
Is on an all time low
So don't expect me
To behave perfectly
And wear that sunny smile
My guess is I'm in
For a cloudy and overcast
Don't try and stop me
'Cause I'm heading
For that stormy weather soon

[Chorus]
I'm causing a mild sensation
With this new occupation
I'm permanently glued
To this extraordinary mood
So now move over
And let me take over
With my melancholy blues

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
I'm causing a mild sensation
With this new occupation
I'm in the news
I'm just getting used
To my new exposure
So come into my enclosure
And meet my melancholy blues

[Verse 1]
Oh, how wrong can you be?
Oh, to fall in love
Was my very first mistake
How was I to know
I was far too much in love to see?
Oh, jealousy, look at me now
Jealousy, you got me somehow
You gave me no warning
Took me by surprise
Jealousy, you led me on
You couldn't lose, you couldn't fail
You had suspicion on my trail

[Chorus]
How, how, how, oh my jealousy
I wasn't man enough
To let you hurt my pride
Now I'm only left with my own jealousy

[Verse 2]
Oh, how strong can you be
With matters of the heart?
Life is much too short
To while away with tears
If only you could see
Just what you do to me
Oh, jealousy, you tripped me up
Jealousy, you brought me down
You bring me sorrow, you cause me pain
Jealousy, when will you let go?
Got a hold of my possessive mind
Turned me into a jealous kind

[Chorus]
How, how, how, oh my jealousy
I wasn't man enough
To let you hurt my pride
Now I'm only left with my own jealousy

[Outro]
But now it matters not
If I should live or die
'Cause I'm only left
With my own jealousy

[Verse 1]
Keep your chin up
When you're feeling lonely
Don't let 'em get you down
Ain't no use in your sitting
All alone, hanging around
For someone to call, oo-oo-ooh
They won't come knocking at all
Don't run and hide
Even if it hurts you inside
So I said, "give as good as you get"
Yeah!

[Chorus]
(If you can't beat 'em, join 'em)
You'd better do it
'Cause it makes you feel good
(If you can't beat 'em, join 'em)
You're never gonna help yourself
Yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Come on, go
Get up!
Hey-hey!
It sure feels good

[Verse 2]
Keep your big hands off of my money
Don't try and pull me down
You're taking me out to wine
And dine me, trying to wind
Me 'round and around and bind me
To your legal contract (Ha ha!)
Rumour has it that you can play it dirty
I'll tell you what I'll do
About that, that yeah!
I'll play you at your own game!
Yes

[Chorus]
(If you can't beat 'em, join 'em)
You'd better do it
'Cause it makes you feel good
(If you can't beat 'em, join 'em)
You're never gonna help yourself
Yeah
That's good
Play it again!

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
(If you can't beat 'em, join 'em)
Oh, you'd better do it
'Cause it makes you feel good
(If you can't beat 'em, join 'em)
It's everyone for themselves!

[Outro]
Move on out!
Hey!
Oh, I like it!
Rock 'n' Roll ready! Yeah
Woo-hoo!

[Intro]
Hey, it's a sellout!
Hey!

[Verse 1]
Let me welcome you ladies and gentlemen
I would like to say hello
Are you ready for some entertainment?
Are you ready for a show?
Gonna rock you, gonna roll you
Get you dancing in the aisles
Jazz you, razzamatazz you
With a little bit of style, c'mon

[Chorus]
Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you

[Lyrical Break]
I've come here to sell you my body
I can show you some good merchandise
I'll pull you and I'll pill you
I'll Cruella DeVille you
And to thrill you, I'll use any device
Ah, ha ha ha ha

[Bridge]
We'll give you crazy performance
We'll give you grounds for divorce
We'll give you piece de resistance
And a tour de force, of course!

[Verse 2]
We found the right location
Got a lot of pretty lights
The sound and amplification, listen
Hey, if you need a fix, if you want a high
Stickells'll see to that
With Elektra and EMI
We'll show you where it's at, so c'mon

[Chorus]
Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Just take a look at the menu
We give you rock a la carte
We'll breakfast at Tiffany's
We'll sing to you in Japanese
We're only here to entertain you

[Verse 3]
If you wanna see some action
You get nothing but the best
The S and M attraction
We've got the pleasure chest
Chicago down to New Orleans
We get you on the line
If you dig the New York scene
We'll have a son-of-a-bitch-of-a-time, come on

[Outro]
Let me entertain
Let me entertain
Let me entertain you
Through the night

Hey, where's my backstage pass?
Those grateful and outrageous costumes!
(Not many, not many...)

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
If you’re feeling tired and lonely
Uninspired and lonely
If you’re thinking how
The days seem long
All you’re given
Is what you’ve been given
A thousand times before

[Chorus]
It's just more, more
More of that jazz
More, no more
Of that jazz
Gimme no more, no more
Of that jazz

[Verse 2]
Only football gives us thrills
Rock 'n' roll just pays the bills
Only our team is the real team
Bring out the dogs
Get on your feet, lay on the floor
Can’t help thinking
I’ve heard that line before

[Chorus]
It's just more, more, more
Of that jazz
More, no more
Of that jazz
Gimme no more, no more
Of that jazz

[Bridge]
Oh, no matter
Fool got no business
Hanging 'round and tellin' lies
Bicycle races are coming your way
If you can’t beat ‘em join them
Fun it
Oh, you’re gonna let it all hang out
Fat bottomed girls you make
The rocking world go round

[Outro]
No more, no more, no more (oh)
Of that jazz

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
Curren$y the hot spitter
Fast life, slow slow
Lost a couple, that ain't shit, I got more
Bank so easy, niggas you know me
Bitches talk sideways get smacked the fuck up
I'm a pimp, but I don't move with a pimp cup
I'd rather keep my drinks in a thermos
Told yall before I was an advanced learner
Cops tryna send me off to camp like Ernest
Yeah, but I ain't going for that walk
Fuck around with me and I just let that gat talk
Yeah, I'mma let that heat spray
Right where you standing that's where you gone lay
Still play it cool, get off the streets
Cops came to the house, moms told them I was sleep
Cause she memorized the script to a tee
Told them that I had the flu and I was in the bed for weeks
Yeah, another victim of a murderer
Got your family running asking people have they heard of ya
All over, putting up posters
Like you got an album about to drop
But there ain't nothing bout to drop but that casket
Label me a bastard even though I know my pops, yeah
Rap game said I fell off the scene
Though I'm coming back like I forgot my keys, yeah

[Verse 2: Boo]
It's a shame how I gotta duck shots
From these hating ass niggas and these crooked ass cops
Fuck it, it just make me grind harder
Now I'm signed to young Carter
P89 be the answers to the my problem
Benchwarmers getting mad, I'm a starter
Number 1 draft pick, laughing in a black 6
Talk big shit and still turn bricks like back flips
Young Money be the circle that I ride fo'
Nigga we live to stay fly on you ass holes
It ain't a doubt, I'mma rep that Chicago
But I got so much love for the south
Where the women be most thick and give great mouth
And love all the shit that a thug be 'bout
Now let these things ling out
YM bitch, now it's time to bang out

[Verse 3: Mack Maine]
Gorilla with the flow, nigga finna blow
Ice everywhere, chinchilla to the flo'
Escalade trucks with the chromed out buggy
Type of shit I got since the nigga got paid
Nigga gained a little weight but the hoes still love me
Still let a nigga put the dick to they face
Run up in your crib, put the burner to your face
Leave the scene with out a trace at a earn hard pace
But no I ain't bail, I ain't tryna hit the wall
Tryna mack a little broad and get her back to the place
Yo man trip, I show 'em what the Ruger hold
Catch a flight to Jayville, can't miss the Super Bowl
Then it's back to the hood cause I love the streets
Better find Noah's Ark, bout to flood the streets
Young Money, that's the clan
Young Maine, I'm the man
Getting money is the plan
The Rugers don't jam

[Verse 4: Lil' Wayne]
Weezy F. kinda nice with the Glock
But I'm better than that with the rock
Tryna land me a spot at the Roc
And my city got word of that
Niggas want me to hook them up with Fox
I done got young Mal off the block
Now the haters don't know where he at
Tryna do the same thing for Cap-
That's my young brother, he got shop
If a nigga try to jack
Then we coming back like Hip-Hop
Got the bullets coming out the pump
Running through your stomach back like a Running Back
I ain't got the Emmitt Smith bitch I got the Dorset
AR-33 shooting like a Cowboy
Tryna see red skin, bitch I'm fly, I'm sky born
Young Ozzy Osbourne floating like the cloud boy
Got them bitches pilled up, blowing like a plow truck
With they fucking mouths up, south up!

[Verse 1]
Monday
Start of my holiday
Freedom for just one week
Feels good to get away
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
Tuesday
Saw her down on the beach
I stood and watched a while
And she looked and smiled at me

[Bridge]
Wednesday, I didn't see her
I hoped that she'd be back tomorrow
And then on Thursday
My luck had changed
She stood there all alone
I went and asked her name

[Chorus]
I never thought that this
Could happen to me
In only seven days
It would take a hundred or more
For memories to fade

[Verse 3]
I wish Friday
Would last forever
I held her close to me
I couldn't bear to leave her there

[Bridge]
Saturday
Just twenty-four hours
Oh no, I'm going back
Home on Sunday

[Outro]
I'm so sad alone

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Oh, I used to be your baby
Used to be your pride and joy, hmm
You used to take me dancing
Just like any other boy
But now you've found another partner
You've left me like a broken toy

[Verse 2]
Oh, it's someone else you're taking
Someone else you're playing to
Honey, though I'm aching
Know just what I have to do
If I can't have you when I'm waking
I'll go to sleep and dream I'm with you

[Chorus]
Oh take me, take me
Take me to the dreamers' ball
I'll be right on time
And I'll dress so fine
You're going to love me
When you see me
I won't have to worry
Take me, take me
Promise not to wake me
Til it's morning, it's all been true

[Bridge]
What d'you say about that, hey honey?
You gonna take me
To that dreamers' ball?
I'd like that
Right on that 42nd street
Way down, downtown dreamers' ball

[Chorus]
Oh take me, take me
Take me I'm your plaything now
You make my life worthwhile
With the slightest smile
Or destroy me with a barely
Perceptible whisper
Gently take me
Remember I'll be dreaming
Of my baby at the dreamer's ball

[Outro]
Take me, hold me
Remember what you told me
You'd meet me at the dreamers' ball
I'll meet you at the dreamers' ball

[Verse 1]
Everybody in the morning
Should do a good turn all right
Everybody in the night time
Should have a good time all night
Now we got a movement
Don't shun it, fun it

[Verse 2]
Can't you see? Now you're moving free
Get some fun, join our dynasty
Can't you tell? When we get it down
You're the one, you're the best in town

[Chorus]
Hey, everybody, everybody
Gonna have a good time tonight
Just shaking the soles of your feet
Everybody, everybody
Gonna have a good time tonight
That's the only soul you'll ever meet

[Verse 3]
They say that moving
The body's jive it's all right
That's the only one part
Of being alive, all right, all right

[Verse 4]
Groove on out, groove on up, okay
Do your thing, do your thing your way
Get your kicks, get your tricks with me
Get up and dance, honey, fun's for free

[Chorus]
Everybody, everybody
Gonna have a good time tonight
Just shaking the soles of your feet
Everybody, everybody
Gonna have a good time tonight
Time tonight, time tonight
That's the only soul you'll ever meet

[Outro]
Don't shun it, fun it
Don't shun it, fun it
Don't shun it, fun it

[Verse 1]
I take a step outside and I breathe the air
And I slam the door and I'm on my way
I won't lay no blame
I won't call you names
'Cause I've made my break
And I won't look back
I've turned my back
On those endless games

[Verse 2]
I'm all through with ties
I'm all tired of tears
I'm a happy man, don't it look that way?
Shaking dust from my shoes
There's a road ahead
And there's no way
Back home (no way back home)
Oh, but I have to say

[Chorus]
Leaving home ain’t easy
Oh, I never thought it would be easy
Leaving on your own
Oh, there's a million things
A-calling me back
Leaving home ain’t easy
On the one you're leaving home

[Bridge]
Stay my love
My love, please stay
Don't stray, my love
What's wrong, my love?
What's right, my love?

[Chorus]
Leaving home ain’t easy
My God, how could I think of leaving?
Leaving on your own
Still trying to persuade me that
Leaving home ain’t necessarily
The only way

[Outro]
Leaving home ain’t easy
But may be the only way

[Hook]
There's a moment where things click. When I was in the studio I was threading the songs together and I...thought of this performance which was a really defining moment in my life as a child. In my mind we would perform on Star Search, we would win; we would get a record deal and that was my dream at the time. There's no way in the world I would ever imagine losing as a possbility. You know, I was only 9 years old so, at that time, you don't realise that you could actually work super hard and give everything you have and lose! It was the best message for me. When I put Ed MacMahon introducing us as "the Hip-Hop rapping Girls' TYME" it clicked something in my mind. I feel like something about the aggression of Bow Down and the attitude of Flawless - the reality is, sometimes you lose. And you're never too good to lose, you're never too big to lose, you're never too smart to lose; it happens, and it happens when it needs to happen. And you have to embrace those things



I was scrolling through videos about feminism on YouTube and I ran across this video of this incredible Nigerian author, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Everything she said is exactly how I feel

My message behind this album is finding the beauty in imperfection. I had this image of this trophy and me accepting these awards and kind of training myself to be this champion. And at the end of the day when you go through all of these things, is it worth it? I mean, you get this trophy and you're like, 'I basically starved, I have neglected all of the people that I love, I've conformed to what everybody else thinks I should be and I have this trophy. What does that mean?'. The trophy represents all of the sacrafices I made as a kid. All of the time that I lost, being on the road/ in the studios as a child. And, I just wanna throw that shit up
I have a lot of awards and I have a lot of these things that I'm amazing and I'm - I worked my ass of, I worked harder then probably everybody I know to get those things but nothing feels like my child saying 'Mommy'. No, nothing feels like when I look at my husband in the eyes, nothing feels like when I'm respected, when I get on the stage and I see I'm changing people's lives. Those are the things that matter and, at this point in my life, that's what I'm striving for. Growth, love, happiness, fun; enjoying your life, it's short - that's the message
I see music. It's more than just...what I hear. When I'm connected to something, I immediately see a visual or a series of images that are tied to a feeling or emotion. A memory from my childhood, thoughts about life, my dreams or my fantasies and they're all connected to the music. And I think that's one of the reasons why I wanted to do a visual album; I wanted people to hear the songs with the story that's in my head, cause it's what makes it mine. That vision in my brain is what I want people to experience the first time



I feel like, right now, people experience music differently. I remember seeing Thriller on TV with my family. It was an event; we all sat around the TV and now, looking back, I'm so lucky I was born around that time. I miss that...immersive experience. Now, people only listen to a few seconds of a song on their iPods - they don't really invest in a full album. It's all about the single and the hype, there's so much that gets between the music and the artist and the fans. I felt like 'I don't want anybody to give the message when my record is comnig out. I just want this to come out when it's ready and from me to my fans'. I told my team 'I wanna shoot a video for every song and put them all out at the same time', everyone thought I was crazy but we're actually doing it. It's happening



I wanted to make this body of work and, I feel like it's something that's lost in Pop music. I wanted people to hear things differently and have a different first impression. Not just listen to a ten second clip but see the whole vision of the album. It was important that we made this a movie, we made this an experience. I wanted everyone to see the whole picture and to see how personal everything is to me. I would make my best art and just put it out and that's-that's why it's out today

[Chorus]
Call me if you need my love (my love, babe)
Call me if you need my love

[x5]

[Verse 1]
She lives in a luxury
Apartment in the heart of town
I live in the country and
My house is tumbling down (ooh ooh)

[Chorus]
Call me if you need my love

[x4]

[Verse 2]
I met her in her neighborhood
I was just passing through
One look was all I took, yeah
One look or two (ooh ooh)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You got my name, you got my number
You got my number, you got my name
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
(Have mercy)

Now I am going to settle down
Get myself a wife or two
No more of this running around
Like I used to do

[Chorus]
Call me if you need my love, babe
Call me if you need my love
Call me if you need my love (oh, babe)
Call me if you need my love
Call me if you need my love (oh, babe)
Call me if you need my love
Call me if you need my love (oh, babe)
Call me if you need my love

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Open up your mind
And let me step inside
Rest your weary head
And let your heart decide

[Chorus]
It's so easy when you know the rules
It's so easy, all you have
To do is fall in love
Play the game
Everybody play the game of love
Yeah

[Verse 2]
When you're feeling down
And your resistance is low
Light another cigarette
And let yourself go

[Chorus]
This is your life, don't play hard to get
It's a free world, all you have
To do is fall in love
Play the game
Everybody play the game of love
Ooh yeah

[Bridge]
My game of love has just begun
Love runs from my head
Down to my toes
My love is pumping
Through my veins (play the game)
Driving me insane
(Come, come, come, come)
Come play the game
Play the game, play the game
Play the game

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Play the game
Everybody play the game of love
This is your life, don't play hard to get
It's a free world (free world)
All you have to do is fall in love

[Outro Chorus]
Play the game, yeah
Everybody play the game of love
Your life, don't play hard to get
It's a free world (free world)
All you have to do is fall in love
Play the game
Everybody play the game of love

[Verse 1]
No, I'll never look back in anger
No, I'll never find me an answer
You promised me you'd keep in touch
I read your letter and it hurt me so much

[Chorus]
I said I'd never
Never be angry with you

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna feel like a stranger, no
'Cause I'd rather stay out of danger
I read your letter so many times
I got your meaning between the lines

[Chorus]
I said I'd never
Never be angry with you

[Bridge]
I must be strong so she won't know
How much I miss her
I only hope as time
Goes on, I'll forget her
My body's aching, can't sleep at night
I'm too exhausted to start a fight
And if I see her with another guy
I'll eat my heart out 'cause I love
Love, love, love her

[Verse 3]
Come on baby, let's get together
I'll love you, baby, I'll love you forever
I'm trying hard, to stay away
What made you change, what did I say?

Ooh, I need your loving tonight
Ooh, I need your loving
Ooh, I need your loving
Ooh, I need your loving, baby, tonight

[Guitar Solo]

[Interlude]
Ooh, I need your loving tonight

No, I'll never, look back in anger
No, I'll never, find me an answer
Gave me no warning, how could I guess
I'll have to learn to forgive and forget

[Refrain]
Ooh, I need your loving
Ooh, I need your loving
Ooh, I need your loving tonight

When it is real rock and roll

[Verse 1]
You really think they like
To rock in space?
Well, I don't know, what do you know?
What do you hear
On the radio?
Coming through the air

[Pre-Chorus]
I said Mama
I ain't crazy
I am alright, alright

[Chorus]
Hey, c'mon baby, said it's alright
To rock and roll on a Saturday night
I said shoot and get your suit
And come along with me
I said c'mon baby down
Come and rock with me

What do you do
To get to feel alive?
You go downtown
And get some of that prime jive

[Pre-Chorus]
I said Mama
I ain't crazy
I am alright, alright

[Chorus]
Hey, c'mon baby said it's alright
To rock and roll on a Saturday night

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Hey, c'mon baby said it's alright

Get some of that, get, get down
Come on honey
We are going to rock it tonight

[Verse 1]
I get some headaches
When I hit the heights
Like in the morning
After crazy nights, yeah
Like some mother-in-law
In her nylon tights

[Chorus]
They're always, they're always
They're always, they're always
Coming soon, coming soon
On the outside, of the tracks

[Verse 2]
You take them, the same old babies
With the same old toys
The neighbors screaming
When the noise annoys
Somebody nagging you
When you are out with the boys

[Chorus]
They're always, they're always
They're always, they're always
Coming soon. coming soon
On the outside, of the tracks

[Bridge]
They're, they're
They're, tonight

[Chorus]
They're always, they're always
They're always, they're always
Coming soon, coming soon
On the outside, of the tracks

[Outro]
Coming soon, coming soon
On the outside, of the tracks

[Verse 1]
It started off so well
They said we made a perfect pair
I clothed myself in your glory and your love
How I loved you, how I cried
The years of care and loyalty
Were nothing but a sham, it seems
The years belie, we lived a lie
I love you 'til I die

[Chorus]
Save me, save me, save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me, save me, save me
I'm naked and I'm far from home

[Verse 2]
The slate will soon be clean
I’ll erase the memories
To start again with somebody new
Was it all wasted, all that love?
I hang my head and I advertise
A soul for sale or rent
I have no heart, I am cold inside
I have no real intent

[Chorus]
Save me, save me, save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me, save me, oh
I'm naked and I'm far from home

[Instrumental]

[Pre-Chorus]
Each night I cry
I still believe the lie
I love you 'til I die (Ow!)

[Outro]
Save me, save me, save me (Oh yeah)
Yeah, save me (Yeah)
Save me, ooh (Oh, save me)
Don't let me face my life alone
Save me, save me, ooh (Save me)
I'm naked and I'm far from home

[Intro]
(Radio)
(Radio)

[Verse 1]
I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio

[Verse 2]
You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly (Radio)
So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there

[Pre-Chorus]
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (Radio)

[Chorus]
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo, radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you

[Verse 3]
We watch the shows, we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years
Let's hope you never leave, old friend
Like all good things, on you we depend
So stick around 'cause we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual

[Pre-Chorus]
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (Radio)

[Chorus]
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo, radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo, radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Someone still loves you

[Bridge]
(Radio ga ga, radio ga ga)
(Radio ga ga, radio ga ga)
(Radio ga ga, radio ga ga)

[Outro]
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (Radio)

God works in mysterious ways
Mysterious ways
Ah...

[Verse 1]
Hey! One man, one goal
Ha, one mission
One heart, one soul
Just one solution
One flash of light
Yeah, one god, one vision

One flesh, one bone, one true religion
One voice, one hope, one real decision

All we need is one worldwide vision

[Chorus]
One flesh, one bone, one true religion
One race, one hope, one real decision

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa-yeah, whoa-yeah, oh yeah!

[Bridge]
I had a dream when I was young
A dream of sweet illusion
A glimpse of hope and unity
And visions of one sweet union
But a cold wind blows
And a dark rain falls
And in my heart, it shows
Look what they've done to my dream
Yeah!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
One vision
So give me your hands
Give me your hearts
I'm ready! There's only one direction
One world and one nation
Yeah, one vision

[Chorus]
No hate, no fight, just excitation
All through the night, it's a celebration

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, yeah!

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
One flesh, one bone, one true religion
One voice, one hope, one real decision

[Outro]
Give me one night, yeah
Give me one hope, hey
Just give me, ah
One man, one man
One bar, one night
One day, hey, hey
Just gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme fried chicken!
(Vision, vision, vision, vision)
God works in mysterious ways...

[Intro]
Are you ready?
Hey, are you ready?
We're gonna turn it up!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Turn me loose, baby

[Verse 1]
Hey, give me your mind, baby
Give me your body
Give me some time, baby
Let's have a party
It ain't no time for sleepin', baby
Soon it's round your street I'm creeping
You better be ready

[Chorus]
We're gonna tear it up, stir it up
Break it up, baby
You gotta tear it up, shake it up
Make it up as you go along
Tear it up, square it up
Wake it up, baby
Tear it up, stir it up
Stake it out, and you can't go wrong
Hey! Listen

[Verse 2]
I love you 'cause you're sweet
I love you 'cause you're naughty
Yeah, I love you for your mind
Baby, give me your body
Oh, I wanna be a toy
At your birthday party
Wind me up, wind me up
Wind me up, let me go
Yeah

[Chorus]
Tear it up, stir it up
Break it up, let me go
Tear it up, shake it up
Make it up as you go along
Tear it up, turn it up
Burn it up

You're driving me ga ga

[Intro]
It's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic
A kind of magic

[Verse 1]
One dream, one soul
One prize, one goal
One golden glance of what should be
(It's a kind of magic)
One shaft of light that shows the way
No mortal man can win this day
(It's a kind of magic)
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time
(It's a kind of magic)

[Pre-Chorus]
The waiting seems eternity
The day will dawn of sanity
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
Is this a kind of magic?
(It's a kind of magic)
There can be only one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done

[Verse 2]
This flame that burns inside of me
I'm hearing secret harmonies
(It's a kind of magic)
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time
(It's a kind of magic)
(It's a kind of magic)

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be, will soon be
Will soon be done!
This is (this is) a kind (a kind)
Of magic (yeah)
There can be only one, one, one, one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be done (done!)

[Bridge]
(Magic), it's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic
Magic, magic, magic, magic!
(Magic), ha-ha-ha-ha, it's magic

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Ha-ha
Yeah, yeah
Whoo
It's a kind of magic!

[Chorus]
Just one year of love
Is better than a lifetime alone
One sentimental moment in your arms
Is like a shooting star
Right through my heart
It's always a rainy day without you
I'm a prisoner of love inside you
I'm falling apart all around you, yeah

[Verse]
My heart cries out to your heart
I'm lonely but you can save me
My hand reaches out for your hand
I'm cold but you light the fire in me
My lips search for your lips
I'm hungry for your touch
There's so much left unspoken
And all I can do is surrender
To the moment your surrender

[Saxophone Solo]

[Bridge]
And no one ever told me
That love would hurt so much
(Oooh, yes it hurts)
And pain is so close to pleasure
And all I can do is surrender to your love
(Just surrender to your love)

[Chorus]
Just one year of love
Is better than a lifetime alone
One sentimental moment in your arms
Is like a shooting star
Right through my heart
It's always a rainy day without you
I'm a prisoner of love inside you
I'm falling apart all around you
And all I can do is surrender

[Verse 1]
They were born with the knowledge of the struggle to survive
They were raised, learning only ways to stay alive
Their language is the language of the bullet and the gun
If you can see them coming, baby better run

[Chorus]
Here come the war boys
Here come the war boys

[Verse 2]
Well they look so pretty as they march and drill
It is such, a pity that they are dressed to kill
Soldiers marching two by two
When it all comes down they know exactly what to do

[Chorus]
Here come the... war

[Verse 3]
War boys, war boys, children and their toys
War boys, war boys, make lot a noise
War boys, when the lightning explodes
I pray for your soul

[Bridge]
Hop...2...3...4

Well they look so fierce they are going to tear out your heart
When they get near we are going to see what they got
Hold on to your soul, friend of mine
I will see you in hell, some other time

[Outro]
Here come the boys
Helping to kill, those who deserve to die
Tell me who decides
You and I
We have the power

[Intro]
I don't want my freedom
There's no reason for living
With a broken heart

[Verse 1]
This is a tricky situation
I've only got myself to blame
It's just a simple fact of life
It can happen to anyone

[Pre-Chorus]
You win, you lose
It's a chance you have to take with love
Oh yeah, I fell in love
But now you say it's over
And I'm falling apart
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
It's a hard life
To be true lovers together
To love and live forever
In each other's hearts
It's a long hard fight
To learn to care for each other
To trust in one another
Right from the start
When you're in love

[Verse 2]
I try and mend the broken pieces
I try to fight back the tears
They say it's just a state of mind
But it happens to everyone

[Pre-Chorus]
How it hurts (Yeah) deep inside (Oh yeah)
When your love has cut
You down to size
Life is tough, on your own
Now I'm waiting for something
To fall from the skies
I'm waiting for love

[Chorus]
Yes, it's a hard life
True lovers together
To love and live forever
In each other's hearts
It's a long hard fight
To learn to care for each other
To trust in one another
Right from the start
When you're in love

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
(Yeah!) It's a hard life
In a world that's filled with sorrow
There are people searching
For love in every way
It's a long hard fight (hard fight!)
But I'll always live for tomorrow
I'll look back on myself
And say I did it for love

[Outro]
Yes, I did it for love
For love
Oh, oh, oh I did it for love

[Verse 1]
Hey, I'm gonna take a little
Walk on the wild side
I'm gonna loosen up and get me some gas
I'm gonna get me some action
Go crazy, driving in the fast lane
My baby left me alone
She done me dirty and I'm feeling so lonely

[Pre-Chorus]
So come home, come home
If you don't you're gonna
Break my heart

[Chorus]
Man on the prowl
You better watch out
I am on the loose and I am
Looking for trouble
So look out, look out
I'm a man on the prowl

[Verse 2]
I don't want to be a rock and roll steady
I just want to be low down trash
I wanna go to the movies
All I wanna do is sit on my ass
So honey, come home
Don't leave me when I am
Feeling so lonely

[Pre-Chorus]
Come home, come home
If you don't you are going
To break my heart

[Chorus]
Man on the prowl
You better watch out
I'm on the loose and I'm
Looking for trouble
So look out, look out
'Cause I'm a man on the prowl

[Bridge]
Well, I keep dreaming about my baby
But it ain't gonna get me nowhere
I gotta teach my baby dancing
But I am not Fred Astaire

[Outro]
So baby look out
I am a man on the prowl
Look out
Man on the prowl, yeah, yeah
Baby, baby, baby look out
Man on the prowl
Baby come home
I am on the loose and I'm
Looking for trouble
Baby come home, oh yeah
'Cause I am a man on the prowl
So honey come home, come home
'Cause I am a man on the prowl, yeah
Man on the prowl, yeah, hey
Steady there
Loosen up, whoo!

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure
Oh yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together
All your life
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure
Everybody knows
One day we're loving each other
Then we're fighting one another
All the time

[Verse 1]
When I was young
And just getting started
And people talked to me
They sounded broken hearted
Then I grew up and got my 'magination
And all I wanted
Was to start a new relation
So in love, but love had a bad reaction
I was looking for
Some good old satisfaction
But pain is all I got when all I needed
Was some love and affection

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure
Yeah, yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together
All your life
Pain and pleasure

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, pain and pleasure
When your plans go wrong
And you turn out the light
But inside of your mind
You put up a fight

[Verse 2]
Where are the answers
That we're all searching for?
There's nothing in this world
To be sure of anymore
Some days you're feeling good
Some days you're feeling bad
But if you're feeling happy
Someone else is always sad
Let the sweetness of love
Wipe the tears from your face
For better for worse
So let's make the best
Of the rest of our years

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure
I told you so
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together
All your life
Pain and pleasure
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure
Yeah, yeah
Sunshine and rainy weather
Go hand in hand together
All your life

[Outro]
All your life, ooh
Pain, pleasure
Pain, pleasure
Pain, pleasure
Pain, pleasure

[Intro]
Machines, machines
Machines, machines
Machines machines
Machines, machines

[Verse 1]
It's a machine's world
Don't tell me I ain't got no soul
When the machines take over
It ain't no place for rock 'n' roll
They tell me I don't care
But deep inside I'm just a man

[Chorus]
They freeze me, they burn me
They squeeze me, they stress me
With smoke-blackened pistons
Of steel they compress me
But no one, but no one
But no one can wrest me away
Back to Humans

[Bridge]
We have no disease
No troubles of mind
We are fighting for peace
No regard for the time
We never cry, we never retreat
We have no conception
Of love or defeat

[Verse 2]
What's that machine noise?
It's bytes and mega chips for tea
It's that Machine, boys
With random access memory
Never worry, never mind
Not for money, not for gold, yeah

[Chorus]
It's software, its hardware
Its heartbeat, is time-share
It's midwife's, a disk drive
It's sex-life is quantized
It's self-perpetuating
A parahumanoidarianised
Back to Humans
Back to Humans

[Post-Chorus]
Back to Machines
Machines, machines
Machines, machines

[Outro]
Living in a new world
Thinking in the past (humans)
Living in a new world
How you gonna last? (humans)
Machine world
It's a Machine's world
Back to Humans
Back to Humans

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Another red letter day
So the pound has dropped
And the children are created
The other half ran away
Taking all the cash
And leaving you with the lumber

[Pre-Chorus]
Got a pain in the chest
Doctors on strike
What you need is a rest
It's not easy, love
But you got friends you can trust

[Chorus]
Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love
They give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life
And all hope is lost
Hold out your hands
'Cause friends will be friends
Right till the end

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Now it's a beautiful day
The postman delivered
A letter from your lover
Only a phone call away
You try to track him down
But somebody stole his number

[Pre-Chorus]
As a matter of fact
You're getting used to life
Without him in your way
It's so easy now
'Cause you got friends you can trust

[Chorus]
Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love
They give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life
And all hope is lost
Hold out your hands
Cause friends will be friends
Right 'til the end

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
It's so easy now
Cause you got friends you can trust

[Chorus]
Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love
They give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life
And all hope is lost
Hold out your hand
Cause friends will be friends
Right 'til the end

[Outro]
Friends will be friends
When you're in need of love
They give you care and attention
Friends will be friends
When you're through with life
And all hope is lost
Hold out your hand
Cause right 'til the end
Friends will be friends, yeah

[Verse 1]
I want to break free
I want to break free
I want to break free from your lies
You're so self-satisfied, I don't need you
I've got to break free
God knows, God knows I want to break free

[Verse 2]
I've fallen in love
I've fallen in love for the first time
And this time I know it's for real
I've fallen in love, yeah
God knows, God knows I've fallen in love

[Bridge]
It's strange but it's true, yeah
I can't get over the way you love me like you do
But I have to be sure
When I walk out that door
Oh, how I want to be free, baby
Oh, how I want to be free
Oh, how I want to break free

[Verse 3]
But life still goes on
I can't get used to living without, living without
Living without you by my side
I don't want to live alone, hey
God knows, got to make it on my own
So baby, can't you see?
I've got to break free

[Outro]
I've got to break free
I want to break free, yeah
I want, I want, I want, I want to break free

[Verse 1: May]
There's no time for us
There's no place for us
What is this thing that builds our dreams
Yet slips away from us?

[Chorus: May]
Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever? Ooh

[Verse 2: Mercury]
There's no chance for us
It's all decided for us
This world has only one sweet moment
Set aside for us

[Chorus: Mercury]
Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever? Ooh
Who dares to love forever
Oh, when love must die?

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge: Mercury & May]
But touch my tears with your lips
Touch my world with your fingertips
And we can have forever
And we can love forever
Forever is our today

[Chorus: Mercury & May]
Who wants to live forever?
Who wants to live forever?
Forever is our today

Who waits forever anyway?

[Outro]

[Intro]
In the garage and water
From the sprinklers
It also left a man's decapitated body
Lying on the floor
Next to his own severed head
A head which at this time
Has no name
I know his name...

[Verse 1]
Here I am
I'm the master of your destiny
Ha-ha

[Chorus]
I am the one, the only one
I am the god of kingdom come
Give me the prize
Just give me the prize

[Verse 2]
Give me your kings
Let me squeeze them in my hands
He-he-hey
Your puny princes
Your so-called leaders of your land
I'll eat them whole before I'm done
The battle's fought and the game is won

[Chorus]
I am the one, the only one
I am the god of kingdom come
Give me the prize
Just give me the prize (the prize)

[Instrumental break]
Now you die!
I have something to say
It's better to burn out
Then to fade away
There can be only one!

[Verse 3]
Move over, I said move over
Hey, hey, hey, clear the way
There's no escape from my authority
Didn't I tell you?

[Chorus]
I am the one, the only one
I am the god of kingdom come
Give me the prize
Just give me the prize

[Outro]
I am the one, the only one
I am the god of kingdom come
So give me the prize

[Intro]
This is the only life for me (yeah)
Surround myself around my own fantasy
You just gotta be strong
And believe in yourself
Forget all the sadness
Cause love is all you need
Love is all you need

[Verse 1]
Do you know what it is like
To be alone in this world
When you're down and out
On your luck and you're a failure
Wake up screaming
In the middle of the night
You think it's all been a waste of time
It's been a bad year
You start believing
Everything's gonna be alright
Next minute you're down
And you're flat on your back
A brand new day's beginning
Get that sunny feeling
And you're on your way

[Chorus]
Just believe
Just keep passing the open windows
Just believe
Just keep passing the open windows

[Verse 2]
Do you know how it feels
When you don't have a friend
Without a job and no money
To spend, you're a stranger
All you think about is suicide
One of these days
You're gonna lose the fight
You better keep out of danger, yeah
That same old feeling
Just keeps burning deep inside
You keep telling yourself
It's gonna be the end
Oh, get yourself together
Things are looking better every day

[Chorus]
Just believe
Just keep passing the open windows
Just believe
Just keep passing the open windows

[Pre-Chorus]
This is the only life for me (yeah)
Surround myself around my own fantasy
You just got to be strong
And believe in yourself
Forget all the sadness
Cause love is all you need

[Chorus]
Just believe
Just keep passing the open windows
Just believe
Just keep passing the open windows

[Guitar solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta be strong
And believe in yourself
Forget all the sadness
Cause love is all you need
Love is all you need
Baby, love is all you need

[Chorus]
Just believe
Just keep passing the open windows
Just believe
Just keep passing the open windows

[Outro]
Just keep passing the open windows
Just keep passing the open windows
Just keep passing the open windows
Just keep passing the open windows
Just keep passing the open windows
Just keep passing the open windows
Just keep passing the open windows
Just keep passing the open windows

[Verse 1]
Here we stand or here we fall
History won't care at all
Make the bed, light the light, yeah
Lady Mercy won't be home tonight, yeah

[Chorus 1]
(You don't waste no time at all)
Don't hear the bell but you answer the call
(It comes to you as to us all)
Yeah, we're just waiting
For the hammer to fall, yeah

[Verse 2]
Oh, ev'ry night and ev'ry day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face, the Western Way
Build your muscles
As your body decays, yeah

[Chorus 2]
(Tow your line and play their game)
Yeah, let the anesthetic cover it all
('Til one day they call your name)
You know it's time for the hammer to fall, yeah

[Bridge]
Rich or poor or famous
For your truth is all the same
Yeah baby (Oh no, oh no)
Oh, lock your door but rain is pouring
Through your window pane (Oh no)
Baby, baby, now your struggle is all in vain

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
For he who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the mushroom cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
We just wanna scream it louder
And louder and louder

[Chorus 3]
(What the hell we fighting for?)
Oh, just surrender and it won't hurt at all
(Just got time to say your prayers)
Ehh, while you're waiting
For the hammer to, hammer to fall

[Outro]
Hey, it's...
It's gonna fall
Hammer, you know
Yeah, hammer to fall
Woo! Yeah, yeah
Woo, woo!
Ha, yeah, waiting
For the hammer to fall, now baby
Yeah, yeah
While you're waiting
For the hammer to fall, ooh
Give it to me one more time!

[Verse 1]
I can see it in your stars
Life is so exciting
Acting so bizarre
Your world is so inviting
Playing really cool
And looking so mysterious
Honey

[Chorus]
Your every day is full of sunshine
But into every life
A little rain must fall

[Post-Chorus]
No problem, uh
Be cool, now

[Verse 2]
Anyone who imagines
They can blind you with science
Bully you all over
With property and finance
But you have position
To call the shots and name the price
Honey

[Chorus]
You found success and recognition
But into every life
A little rain must fall

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
You lead a fairy tale existence
But into every life
A little rain must fall

[Post-Chorus]
Be cool
Ha!
Kiss, kiss

[Verse 3]
Others seem to think
You are over dramatizing
Problems at work
So it's hardly surprising
There's little you can do
To alter their opinions, honey

[Chorus]
You want a clean reputation
But now you're facing complications
'Cause into every life
A little rain must fall

[Post-Chorus]
Be cool, get this
Woo! Alright

[Outro]
Play it nice and cool
Play it nice and cool, yeah
Yes, baby
Ooh, one more time
Uh-huh, I like it
Make it rain

[Intro]
Here we are, born to be kings
We're the princes of the universe
Here we belong
Fighting to survive
In a world with the darkest powers, hey!

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 1]
And here we are
We're the princes of the universe
Here we belong, fighting for survival
We've come to be
The rulers of your world

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
I am immortal, I have inside me
Blood of kings (yeah, yeah)
I have no rival, no man can be my equal
Take me to the future of your world

[Chorus]
Born to be kings
Princes of the universe
Fighting and free
Got your world in my hand
I'm here for your love
And I'll make my stand
We were born to be
Princes of the universe

[Bridge]
No man could understand
My power is in my own hand
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
People talk about you
People say you've had your day)
I'm a man that will go far
Find the moon and reach for the stars
With my sword and head held high
Got to pass the test first time, yeah
I know that people talk about me
I hear it every day
But I can prove them wrong
'Cause I'm right first time

[Interlude]
Yeah, yeah, alright
Let's go, let's go, ha-ha!
Yeah, watch this man fly, whoo!
Bring on the girls

[Pre-Chorus]

Princes of the universe
(Universe, universe, universe)

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Just look at all those hungry
Mouths we have to feed
Take a look at all the suffering we breed
So many lonely faces scattered all around
Searching for what they need

[Chorus]
Is this the world we created?
What did we do it for?
Is this the world we invaded
Against the law?
So it seems in the end
Is this what we're all living for today?
The world that we created

[Verse 2]
You know that everyday
A helpless child is born
Who needs some loving care
Inside a happy home
Somewhere a wealthy man
Is sitting on his throne
Waiting for life to go by

[Chorus]
Is this the world we created?
We made it on our own
Is this the world we devastated
Right to the bone?
If there's a God in the sky, looking down
What can he think of what we've done
To the world that he created?

[Intro]
We had a good night jamming away
There was a full moon showing
And we started to play
But in the cold light of day next morning
The party was over, uh uh
The party was over
We got love and we got style
And we got sex and I know
I know we got what it takes
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa!
Why don't you come back and play?

[Verse 1]
Come back and play (hey hey)
Come back and play
We got all night, all day
Everybody's gone away
Why don't you come back and play
Come back and play
Come back and play, come back and play
Play, play it, play it
Go get 'em boy, let's party
Yeah

[Guitar solo]

[Bridge]
Give it give it
We had a food fight in somebody's face
We were up all night singing (singing)
And giving a chase
But in the cold light of day next morning
Everybody was hung over

[Verse 2]
Hey, come back and play
(Come back and play)
Come back and play
We got all night, all day
Everybody's gone away
Why don't you come
Back and play (and play)
Come back and play
We got all night we got all day
We got all night and day
Come back, come back, come back
Come back, back and play!

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Hey, hey, hey
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
The party is over

[Intro]
Yeah
Ha ha
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I took my baby dancing
To see a heavy band
But never saw my baby till the encore
She had the singer by the hand
I didn't wanna cry 'cause I had to be cool
Didn't wanna tell you that you're much too cruel
Did you have to run off with that dog-gone fool?

[Chorus]
All I gotta do is think about you
Every night and day I go crazy
All I gotta do is get my hands on you
You better stay away from me, baby

[Verse 2]
I wouldn't mind the postman
If the neighbours didn't know
Or the gas man, electric man, a man who'll fix the car
I'd have to let it go
But you had to bring me down for a rock and roll clone
And leave me like a sucker standing all alone
Did you have to run off with that rolling stone?
Go ahead, fool

[Chorus]
All I gotta do is think about you
Every night and day I go crazy
All I gotta do is get my hands on you
You better stay away from me, baby

[Bridge]
So I ain't gonna go to see the Rolling Stones no more, no more
I don't wanna go to see Queen no more, no more
So I ain't gonna go to see the Rolling Stones no more, no more
I don't wanna go to see Queen no more, no more

[Guitar Solo]
Yeah
Yeah!
Go crazy, woo!
Yeah, yeah!

[Verse 3]
I don't wanna hurt you
Like you've been hurting me
But you know that I'll be watching, rolling on the floor
Next time you're on the TV
Had enough of your pretending that you know where it's at
Coming on to all the boys like a real spoiled brat
To think that I nearly let you get away with all that
No way, baby

[Chorus]
All I gotta do is think about you
Every night and day I go crazy
All I gotta do is get my hands on you
You better stay away from me, baby

[Outro]
Ooh!
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta stay away from me, baby
Baby, crazy, crazy, crazy, yeah
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy, woo!

[Verse]
Who said my party was all over
Huh, huh, I'm in pretty good shape
The best years of my life
Are like a supernova
Huh, huh, perpetual craze, I said that
Everybody drank my wine
You get my drift
And then we took a holiday
On Khashoggi's Ship, well
We really had a good, good time
They was all so sexy
We was bad, we was blitzed
All in all it was a pretty good trip

[Hook]
This big bad sucker
With a fist as big as your head
Wanted to get me, I said go away
I said kiss my ass honey
He pulled out a gun
Wanted to arrest me
I said uh, uh, babe
Now listen no-one stops my party
No-one stops my party
No-one, no-one, no-one stops my party
Just like I said
We were phased, we was pissed
Just having a total eclipse

[Bridge]
Bup bup, badabup, badibup bup bup
Bedabup bedadee hey
That's good
Oooh
Wooh wooh wooh
Wooh wooh wooh, hah!
This one's on me so let us
Do it just right
This here one party
Don't get started 'till midnight
Yeah

[Outro]
Hey! Hah!
Everybody's party to the left
Party to the right
Lay mine in the middle
Do it all night, alright alright, hey
Two within the middle with you
We're going buddy
Hey uhh, hey huh
Alright, hey
Left, right, left, right
No one stops my, Aaahh!

[Intro]
And you're rushing headlong
You've got a new goal
And you're rushing headlong
Out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping
And there's nothing you can do about it
Nothing you can do, no
There's nothing you can do about it
No, there's nothing you can, nothing you can
Nothing you can do about it

[Chorus]
And you're rushing headlong
You've got a new goal
And you're rushing headlong
Out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping, no
There's nothing you can do about it
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
Hey, he used to be a man
With a stick in his hand
(Hoop diddy diddy, hoop diddy do)
She used to be a woman
With a hot dog stand
(Hoop diddy diddy, hoop diddy do)
Now you've got soup in the laundry bag
Now you've got strings
You're gonna lose your rag
You're getting in a fight
Then it ain't so groovy
When you're screaming in the night
Let me out of this cheap B-movie!

[Chorus]
Headlong, down the highway
And you're rushing headlong
Out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping
And you can't stop rocking
And there's nothing you can, nothing you can
Nothing you can do about it

[Verse 2]
When a red hot man
Meets a white hot lady
(Hoop diddy diddy, hoop diddy do)
Soon the fire starts raging
Gets you more than half crazy
(Hoop diddy diddy, hoop diddy do)
Ooh, now they start freaking
Everywhere you turn
You can't start walking
Cause your feet got burned
It ain't no time to figure wrong from right
Because reason's out of the window
Better hold on tight

[Chorus]
You're rushing headlong
Headlong
Out of control (yeah!)
And you think you're so strong
There ain't no stopping
And there's nothing you, nothing you
Nothing you can do about it at all

[Guitar solo]
Yeah, yeah
Alright, go!

[Chorus]
And you're rushing headlong
Down the highway
And you're rushing headlong
Out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping
There's nothing, nothing
Nothing you can do about it, yeah

[Outro]
Ha ha
Headlong
Yeah, yeah, yeah (rushing)
Headlong
Headlong
Headlong
Gnoldaeh, gnoldaeh, gnoldaeh, gnoldaeh

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Every drop of rain that falls
In Sahara Desert says it all
It's a miracle
All God's creations great and small
The Golden Gate and the Taj Mahal
That's a miracle
Test tube babies being born
Mothers, fathers dead and gone
It's a miracle

[Chorus 1]
We're having a miracle on earth
Mother nature does it all for us
The wonders of this world go on
The hanging Gardens of Babylon
Captain Cook and Cain and Abel
Jimi Hendrix to the Tower of Babel
It's a miracle, it's a miracle
It's a miracle, it's a miracle

[Bridge]
The one thing we're all waiting for
Is peace on earth, an end to war
It's a miracle we need, the miracle
The miracle we're all waiting for today

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 2]
If every leaf on every tree
Could tell a story that would be
A miracle
If every child on every street
Had clothes to wear and food to eat
That's a miracle
If all God's people could be free
To live in perfect harmony
It's a miracle

[Chorus 2]
We're having a miracle on earth
Mother nature does it all for us
(The wonders of this world go on)
Open hearts and surgery
Sunday mornings with a cup of tea
Super powers always fighting
Mona Lisa just keeps on smiling
It's a miracle, it's a miracle
It's a miracle, it's a miracle

[Instrumental break]
(The wonders of this world go on)
It's a miracle, it's a miracle
It's a miracle, it's a miracle

[Bridge]
The one thing (the one thing)
We're all waiting for (we're all waiting for)
Is peace on earth (peace on earth)
And an end to war (an end to war)
It's a miracle we need - the miracle
The miracle, peace on earth
And end to war, today

[Guitar solo]

[Outro]
That time will come one day you'll see
When we can all be friends
That time will come one day you'll see
When we can all be friends
That time will come one day you'll see
When we can all be friends
That time will come one day you'll see
When we can all be friends

[Intro: Roger Taylor & Freddie Mercury]
I'm the invisible man

Incredible how you can
See right through me

[Interlude 1: Roger Taylor]
Freddie Mercury!

[Verse 1: Freddie Mercury]
When you hear a sound
That you just can't place
Feel something move
That you just can't trace
When something sits
On the end of your bed
Don't turn around
When you hear me tread

[Chorus: Roger Taylor & Freddie Mercury]
I'm the invisible man, I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can
See right through me

John Deacon!

And I'm in your life and I'm in your head
Like the CIA or the FBI
You'll never get close
Never take me alive

[Chorus: Roger Taylor & Freddie Mercury]
I'm the invisible man, I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can
See right through me
I'm the invisible man, I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can
See right through you

[Bridge: Freddie Mercury]
Hah, hah, hah, hello (Professor)
Hah, hah, hah, okay
Hah, hah, hah, hello, hello, hello, hello
Never had a real good friend
Not a boy or a girl
No one knows what I've been through
Let my flag unfurl
So I make my mark
From the edge of the world
From the edge of the world
From the edge of the world

[Interlude 3: Freddie Mercury]
Brian May, Brian May!

[Verse 3: Freddie Mercury]
Now I'm on your track
And I'm in your mind
And I'm on your back
But don't look behind
I'm your meanest thought
I'm your darkest fear
But I'll never get caught
You can't shake me, shake me, dear

[Chorus: Roger Taylor & Freddie Mercury]
I'm the invisible man, I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can
See right through me (Watch me!)
I'm the invisible man, I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can
See right through you

[Interlude 4: Roger Taylor & Freddie Mercury]
Look at me, look at me
Rrrroger Taylor!

[Outro: Freddie Mercury]
Shake you, shake you, shake you, dear

When love breaks up, (Breaks up)
When the dawn light wakes up
A new life is born
Somehow I have to make
This final breakthrough, now!

[Verse 1]
I wake up, feel just fine
Your face fills my mind
I get religion quick
Because you're looking divine
Honey, you're touching something
You're touching me
I'm under your thumb, under your spell
Can't you see?

[Chorus]
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthrough
Oh yeah

[Post-Chorus]

Make my feelings known towards you
Turn my heart inside and out
For you now
Somehow I have to make this
Final (break)thru
(Now!) Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Your smile
Speaks books to me
I break up
With each and every one
Of your looks at me
Honey, you're starting something
Deep inside of me
Honey, you're sparking something
This fire in me
I'm outta control, I want to rush
Headlong into this ecstasy

[Chorus]
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthrough!

All the world's gonna know
Hey, scandal

Into a freak show

They'll see the heartache
They'll see the love break
They'll hear me pleading
We'll say for God sakes
Over and over and over again

[Verse 2]
Scandal
Now you've left me
There's no healing the wounds
Hey, scandal
And all the world
Can make us out to be fools

[Bridge]
Here come the bad news
Open the flood gates
They'll leave us bleeding
We say "you cheapskates!"
Over and over and over again

[Verse 3]
So let them know when they stare
It's just a private affair
They'll have us hung in the air
And tell me what do they care

[Bridge]
It's only a life to be
Twisted and broken
They'll see the heartache
They'll see our love break, yeah
They'll hear me pleading
I'll say for God sakes
Over and over and over
And over again, yeah

The truth from the lies
And in the end, the story
Deeper must hide
Deeper and deeper and deeper inside

[Verse 2]
My lady understands
Understands me right
She understands me
She understands me
Understands me right

[Bridge]
My baby cares, she really cares
She knows what's really right for me
Does me good then she hurts me so
She winds me up then lets me go
Turns me on and then tells me no
She's just a pussy cat
My baby loves me
My baby loves me
My baby cuffs me
One day she tells me
That she cares
Another day she tells me
She don't love me

[Outro]
She really, really does me, ooh
Now people do you believe this?
Do you? Ooh, ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Really, really, really, really
Ah, does me, hey

[Instrumental intro]

[Verse 1]
What is there left for me
To do in this life?
Did I achieve what I had
Set in my sights?
Am I a happy man
Or is this sinking sand?
Was it all worth it?
Was it all worth it?
Yeah, now hear my story
Let me tell you about it

[Pre-Chorus]
We bought a drum kit
I blew my own trumpet
Played the circuit
Thought we were perfect

[Chorus]
Was it all worth it?
Ooh, giving all my heart and soul
And staying up all night
Was it all worth it?
Living breathing rock 'n' roll
A godforsaken life
Was it all worth it?
Was it all worth it all these years?

[Verse 2]
Put down our money
Without counting the cost
It didn't matter if we won
If we lost
Yes, we were vicious
Yes, we could kill
Yes, we were hungry
Yes, we were brill

[Orchestral Interlude]

[Pre-Chorus]
We served a purpose
Like a bloody circus
We were so dandy
We love you madly

[Chorus]
Was it all worth it?
Living breathing rock 'n' roll
This godforsaken life
Was it all worth it?
Was it all worth it?
When the hurly burly's done

[Guitar Solo]

[Synth Orchestra Interlude]

[Pre-Chorus]
We went to Bali
Saw God and Dali
So mystic, surrealistic

[Chorus]
Was it all worth it? Yeah, yeah!
Giving all my heart and soul
And staying up all night
Was it all worth it?
Ooh, living breathing rock 'n' roll
This never ending fight
Was it all worth it?
Was it all worth it?

[Outro]
Yes, it was a worthwhile experience, hahahaha!
It was worth it!

[Intro]
Huh
Let me show it to you
Yeah
Uh
Hey, yeah

[Verse 1]
See what I got
I got a hell of a lot
Tell me what you feel
Is it real? Is it real?
You know I got what it takes
And I can take a lot

[Chorus]
Did you hear the last call baby?
You and me got staying power, yeah!
You and me, we got
Staying power
Staying power, I got it, I got it
Ha!

[Post-Chorus]
I wonder when we're gonna make it
I wonder when we're gonna shake it

[Verse 2]
Rock me, baby, rock me
C'mon you can shock me

You and me we got staying power

[Post-Chorus]
I wonder when we're gonna make it

Don't lose control just hang on out with me
Got to get to know each other
But we got plenty of time

[Chorus]
Did you hear the last call baby?
You and me got staying power, yeah
You and me we got staying power

[Bridge]
Power power power power
Power power power power
Power

[Post-Chorus]
I wonder when we're gonna stick it

Let's get down and go go
Get yourself in the mood
Got to give a little bit of attitude
Baby don't you crash
Let just trash, trash, trash

[Chorus]
Did you hear the last call baby?
You and me got staying power yeah
You and me we got staying power

[Post-Chorus]
(I like it) Staying power

[Outro]
Yeah yeah
Gotcha

[Verse 1]
I'm not invited to the party
Been sitting here all night
I'm all alone at the party
I don't feel all right
Ain't got no black coat
Ain't got no tie
I gotta shape up now
Come on, baby, you gotta know why
Ha, take off!

[Chorus]
Dancer, dancer
I can't live with it I'm gonna die without it
Dancer, dancer
Ain't no doubt about it
Dancer, dancer
Why don't you kick off your dancing shoes
And come and ride with me?

Cool

[Verse 2]
You're the life and soul of the funk-tion
It took me all night
To get hold of the right introduction
Blew me out of sight
I taste your lipstick
I look in your eyes
You feel fantastic
My body cries

[Chorus]
Dancer, dancer
I can't live with it I'm gonna die without it
Dancer, dancer
Ain't no doubt about it
Dancer, dancer
Why don't you kick off your dancing shoes
And come and ride with me?
Hot space, let's go

[Chorus]
Dancer, dancer
I can't believe you're dancing
Dancer, dancer
Can't take you home, I can't take you dancing
Dancer, dancer
Bring out the funk and dance the night away
Dancer, dancer

[Outro]
Dancer, dancer
Dancer, dancer
Dancer, dancer
Dance dance dance dance dance

Guten Morgen, Sie wünschten, geweckt zu werden

[Verse 1]
Don't let go
Don't lose your mystique
Wait a little longer
Tomorrow brings another feast
Don't let go
Don't lose your reputation
Thank God you're still alive
You're still in one piece

[Chorus]
Hang on in there
Don't lose your appetite
Hang on in there
Forget the danger signs
Pray for that magical moment (straight ahead)
And it will appear
Don't fight for lost emotions!
Wait for the sunrise
And everything will seem so clear
(Look straight ahead, look straight ahead!)
Hang on in there (hang on in there)
Hang on in there (hang on in there)
Your wish will be granted
All your problems will disappear
Don't be a fool

[Verse 2]
You haven't reached your peak
You got a fast car racing up inside you
Your life is incomplete

[Chorus]
Hang on in there
Hang on in there!
Pray for that magical moment and it will appear!
(Wait for that moment)
Wait for the sunrise (Ah)
Just wait and see, and it will seem so clear
(duh duh bap bee dee bup bup bup, duh da dup dee da, hey!)

[Bridge]
And let's go, let's go!
Okay, now do the change up
Yeah!
Hang in there!
(Hang on in there)
Yeah, hang on in there!
Yeah!

[Instrumental fade-out]

[Intro]
One, two, three, four
Ooh, ooh!

[Verse 1]
While the sun hangs in the sky
And the desert has sand
While the waves crash in the sea
And meet the land
While there's a wind and the stars
And the rainbow
'Till the mountains crumble into the plain

[Chorus]
Oh yes, we'll keep on trying
Tread that fine line
Oh, we'll keep on trying, yeah
Just passing our time
Ooh, ooh!

[Verse 2]
While we live according to race
Color or creed
While we rule by blind madness
And pure greed
Our lives dictated by tradition
Superstition, false religion
Through the eons, and on and on

[Chorus]
Oh yes, we'll keep on trying
We'll tread that fine line
Oh, we'll keep on trying
'Till the end of time
'Till the end of time!

[Bridge]
Through the sorrow
All through our splendor
Don't take offense at my innuendo

[Spanish Guitar Solo]

[Middle Eight]
You can be anything you want to be
Just turn yourself into anything
You think that you could ever be
Be free with your tempo, be free, be free
Surrender your ego, be free
Be free to yourself

[Guitar Solo]
Ooh, ooh, yeah!

[Verse 3]
If there's a God, or any kind
Of justice under the sky
If there's a point, if there's a reason
To live or die
If there's an answer to the questions
We feel bound to ask
Show yourself, destroy our fears
Release your mask

[Chorus]
Oh yes, we'll keep on trying
Hey, tread that fine line
Yeah, we'll keep on smiling, yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And whatever will be, will be

[Outro]
(We'll just keep on trying)
We'll just keep on trying
'Till the end of time
'Till the end of time
'Till the end of time!

[Intro]
Mmm, yeah
Ha!

[Chorus]
Back chat, Back chat, you burn all my energy
Back chat, Back chat, criticizing all you see
Back chat, Back chat, analyzing what I say
Back chat, Back chat, and you always get your way

[Post-Chorus]
Oh yeah, see what you've done to me

[Verse 1]
Backchat, Backchat, you're driving me insane
It's a battle to the end, knock you down, you come again
Talk back, talk back, you've got me on the rack
Twisting every word I say, you wind me up and get your way
Fat chance I have of making a romance
If I'm ever gonna win, have to get the last word in
Take it from there, twisting every word I say
Huh, wind me up and let me play

[Chorus]
Back chat (oh yeah), Back chat, you burn all my energy
Back chat (huh), Back chat, criticizing all you see
Back chat (hey), Back chat, analyzing what I say
Back chat (yeah), Back chat, and you always get your way

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Wake up, stand up and drag yourself on out
Get down, get ready, scream and shout
Back off, be cool, and learn to change your ways
'Cause you're talking in your sleep and you're walking in a daze
Don't push your luck with me, I'm ready to attack
'Cause when I'm tryna talk to you all you do is just talk back
You stand so tall you don't frighten me at all
Don't talk back, don't talk back, don't talk back
Just leave me alone
Hey

[Chorus]
Back chat, Back chat, you burn all my energy
Back chat (huh), Back chat, criticizing all you see
Back chat, Back chat, analyzing what I say
Back chat, Back chat, and you always get your way

[Outro]
Yes, you do, ah
Yes, you do, baby, c'mon!
Back chat, Back chat
Back chat, Back chat (C'mon)
Back chat, Back chat (Hit me!)
Back chat, Back chat (Go for it! Go for it! Go for it! Baby)
Back chat, Back chat

[Intro]
Action

[Verse 1]
This street honey is a mean street
Living in this street honey needs a mean streak
We've got criminals living in this street

[Refrain]
But there's a heartbeat pulse that keeps on pumping
Like a jukebox playing the same dead record
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring
I gotta feeling, this world is using me

[Verse 2]
This town honey is a dead town
Living in this town honey is a let-down
Coming to this town honey is a showdown

[Refrain]
But there's a heartbeat pulse that keeps on pumping
Some sunshine ray through a crack in a shutter
Or a sight of a light at the end of a tunnel
Still, there's a feeling, this world is using me

[Chorus]
Action this day
Action this night
Oh, we've gotta learn to learn to love to live
You can't say it ain't right
Action this day
Action this night
Oh, you've got the power, you've got the power
You've got the power to love and to live
You can't say it ain't right

[Verse 3]
Your mind honey is a bleak place
Living in your mind's living in a blank space
Your mind is coming from a rat race

[Refrain]
But there's a heartbeat pulse that keeps on pumping
Like a jukebox playing the same dead record
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring
I gotta feeling that just won't quit, this world is using me

[Chorus]
Action this day, yeah
Action this night
Ooh, we've got to learn to learn to live
You can't say it ain't right
Action this day, yeah
Action this night
Oh, You've got the power, you've got the power
You've got the power to love and to live
You can't say it ain't right

[Outro]
Action (hey)
(Hey hey hey)
Action this day
Action this day (this day, yeah)
Action this day
Action this day
Action this day

[Verse 1]
They called him a hero
In the land of the free
But he wouldn't shake my hand, boy
He disappointed me
So I got my handgun
And I blew him away
That critter was a bad guy
I had to make him pay

[Pre-Chorus]
You might fear for my reason
I don't care what they say
Look out, baby, it's the season
For the mad masquerade

[Chorus]
Put out the fire
Put out the fire
Put out the fire
Oh, you need a bullet like a hole in the head
Put out the fire
Put out the fire
Put out the fire
Don't believe what your granddaddy said

[Verse 2]
She was my lover
It was a shame that she died
But the constitution
Is right on my side
'Cause I caught my lover
In my neighbor's bed
I got retribution
Filled 'em all full of lead

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been told it's the fashion
To let me on the streets again
It's nothing but a crime of passion
And I'm not to blame

[Chorus]
Put out the fire
Put out the fire
Put out the fire
You need a weapon like a hole in the head
Put out the fire
Put out the fire, baby
Put out the fire
And let your sons and your daughters sleep sound in their beds

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
You know a gun never killed nobody
You can ask anyone
People get shot by people
People with guns

[Chorus]
Put out the fire
Put out the fire
You need a gun like a hole in the head
Put out the fire
Put out the fire
Put out the fire
Just tell me that old fashioned gun law is dead

[Verse 1]
Guilt stains on my pillow
Blood on my terraces
Torsos in my closet
Shadows from my past

[Chorus]
Life is real, life is real
Life is real, so real

[Verse 2]
Sleeping is my leisure
Waking up in a minefield
Dream is just a pleasure dome
Love is a roulette wheel

[Chorus]
Life is real, life is real
Life is real, oh yeah

[Bridge]
Success is my breathing space
I brought it on myself
I will price it
I will cash it
I can take it or leave it
Loneliness is my hiding place
Breastfeeding myself
What more can I say
I have swallowed the bitter pill
I can taste it, I can taste it

[Chorus]
Life is real, life is real
Life is real

[Verse 3]
Music will be my mistress
Loving like a whore
Lennon is a genius
Living in every pore

[Chorus]
Life is real, life is real
Life is real, so real

[Outro]
Life is cruel
Life is a bitch
Life is real, so real
Life is real, life is real
Yeah, life is real

[Intro]
Calling all boys (boys)
Calling all girls (girls)
Calling all people on streets
Around the world

[Pre-Chorus]
Take this message
A message for you
This message is old, yeah
This message is true
This message is
This message is
This message is
This message is

[Chorus]
Love
Take a message of love
Far and near
Take a message of love
For all to hear
For all to hear

[Verse 1]
Some sleepless nights in wait for you
Some foreign presence you feel
Comes creeping through
Some stream of hope
The whole world through
Spread like some silent disease
You'll get yours too
This message is
This message is
This message is
This message is

[Chorusx2]
Love
Take a message of love
Far and near
Take a message of love
For all to hear
For all to hear

[Outro]
Calling all boys
Calling all girls
Calling all boys
Calling all girls
Calling all girls

[Verse 1]
Don't touch me now, don't hold me now
Don't break the spell darling, now you are near
Look in my eyes and speak to me
The special promises I want to hear

[Chorus]
Las palabras de amor
Let me hear the words of love
Despacito, mi amor
Love me slow and gently

[Verse 2]
One foolish world, so many souls
Senselessly hurled through the never-ending cold
And all for fear, and all for greed
Speak any tongue, but for God's sake we need

[Chorus]
Las palabras de amor
Let me hear the words of love
Despacito, mi amor
Let me know, this night and evermore

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
This room is bare, this night is cold
We're far apart and I'm growing old
But while we live, we'll meet again
So then, my love, we may whisper once more
It's you I adore

[Chorus]
Las palabras de amor
Let me hear the words of love
Despacito, mi amor
Touch me now

[Outro]
Las palabras de amor
Let us share the words of love
Forevermore
Forevermore

[Verse 1]
I believe there is no evil out there we did not have a hand in
You believe it is a time for peace and a time for understanding
Some of us believe that we are chosen
And if God is on our side we will win the game
And some of us believe that there is a heaven
When the trumpets sound and the judges call your name
But let us get it straight

I believe there is just once chance in this world to hear our brothers
You believe there is a better way to listen to each other
We do not get what the other guy is saying
We hear the words but we do not understand
So around the world the same old anger raging
And we all cry for shame and the same old tragedy goes down

[Chorus]
We believe there is a better way to fight
There is a way to make our children safe at night
We believe there is a war we could be winning
But the only way to win it is to give what we need to receive

[Verse 2]
I believe we need a hero to step boldly from the shadows
You believe there must be someone on the scene that fits the bill
A man or a woman who knows how to say I am sorry
With courage in his heart to match his creed
A leader who can build a brand new morning
And match the tide of changes
Match the intent with the deed

[Chorus]
We believe there is a deed of obligation
To bring reconciliation
To make peace with every nation - in our time
We believe there is not a minute we should be wasting
When the darkness falls it is too late to fix the crime
It is peace that we need

[Verse 3]
Every father every mother knows the meaning
Human treasure that our leaders do forget
And the bullets fly in the face of common reason
And the pain we give is the legacy in the end we get

[Chorus]
We believe there is a song that is worth the singing
It is a song of truth we are bringing
There is a way to share the Earth with everyone
We believe every creature has a being
Has a right to respect and feeling
To live and breathe and flourish in the sun
That's what we believe

[Intro]
What planet is this, mmmh?
Let there be rock and roll

[Verse 1]
It is a Saturday night and I am home alone
With the music on quiet I am flying solo
Then my feet start moving to the sound of the beat
Put the music up loud hear it in the street
Then the neighbours start banging on my front door
Throw the door wide open saying what is your point
Come on in let us rock this joint

[Chorus]
We got the whole house rocking

[x5]
To the mighty power of rock and roll

[Verse 2]
We dance out of the door, dance into the street
And all the people are swaying to the musical beat
We rock down the road and down to the town
And all the people stare and smile and get down
Then the police man is saying "stop this noise"
But the beat takes over now he is one of the boys
The beat's taken over now he is one of the boys
Come on down let us rock this town

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Let us go
Let it roll
Are you ready?
Said are you ready?
The Cosmos Rocks

[Verse 3]
Across seven seas through the Panama
Now they are rocking on beaches and they are rocking in bars
Do not ask me how and do not ask me why
From Miami Beach down to old Bondi
There is a rock and roll fever in every place
Next thing you know they'll be rocking out in space

[Chorus]
Come on down let us rock this place
Come on down and
Sock it to me

[Outro]
We got the whole world rocking

[x5]
To the mighty mighty mighty power
We got the cosmos rocking

[x2]
We got the universe rocking
We got the cosmos rocking

[x2]
To the might power of rock and roll

[Verse 1]
With the sun in your eyes and the wind in your face
To heaven you rise in a holy embrace
Your feet on the round your head in the clouds
And you are wondering if you are never coming down
In an instant the mysteries of life will unfold
The myths and the dragons of time will explode
Here is to a real understanding of truth
For compassion and grace to be given their chance too

[Chorus]
Raise up your mind
It is time to shine

[Verse 2]
A moment down through millennium
Unveiling the secrets of song to be sung
Waters of life flowing soft to the touch
Wisdom remembered have we forgotten oh so much

[Chorus]
Raise up your mind
It is time to shine
Raise up your mind
Hey, it is time to shine

[Verse 3]
Let us awaken from barbarity
Into a world of serenity
Beyond the rage of foolish pride
And on to the golden shores of paradise

[Outro]
Raise up your mind
Hey, it is time to shine
Raise up your mind
Hey, it is time to shine
Raise up your mind
Your time to shine
It is time to shine

[x2]

[Verse 1]
I cannot wake in the morning
I cannot sleep at night
I got a pain in my memory
That just will not sit right
You might say I am losing my mind
What a shame, shame, shame
But I do not want and I do not need
To play the crying game
Music lights this flame in me
I will not let it go and it will not let me be
I am just a happy slave and oh I cannot leave it
Because I am still, and I always will - be a believer

[Chorus]
Still burning (yeah)
Still yearning (and the wheel's)
Still turning (ooh let me tell you why)
We are jiving (and the beat's)
Still driven (and we are all)
Sky diving (rock and roll never die)

[Verse 2]
I cannot breathe in the city
Got dust in my lungs
I get mad in the country
Everything seem to go wrong
You might think I am playing around
But my heart is true
I got reason to believe
That sweet soul magic
Going to tear my heart in two
Music makes the world go round
I have been flying on the wings of the sound
It feels so good from way up here
I am still a believer
Heading for the stars

[Chorus]
Oh yeah
Still burning, still yearning
Still burning
Still yearning
Still turning (better than every guy)
We are jiving
Still driving
Sky diving (rock and roll never die)

[Verse 3]
Do not say that you love me I cannot go that road
But do not think for a moment that my heart went cold
I keep thinking about what I lost
And what I might have found
I went to sleep and when I woke
Everything had turned around

[Chorus]
Still burning (yeah)
Still yearning
Still turning (a new day dawning)
We are jiving
Still driving
Sky diving (early in the morning)

[Chorus]
Still burning (yeah)
Still yearning (and the wheel's)
Still turning (better than every guy)
We are jiving (and the beat's)
Still driving (and we are all)
Sky diving (rock and roll never die)

[Intro]
I like to sit here in the sunshine
The trees in the fields are green sublime
Suspended in time
And do not it make you feel small?

[Verse 1]
I like to sit here by the fire's light
The trees in the fields lie bare to the night
The stars burn bright
And do not let it make you feel small?

[Chorus]
Everyone needs a place they can hide
Hide away find a space to be alone
Everyone needs a place they can hide
Everyone needs to find peace sublime

[Verse 2]
I like to sit here in the Autumn time
The trees in the fields they rustle in the wind
The church bells gently chime
Gentle on your mind
Suspended in time
And do not it make you feel small?

[Bridge]
Everyone needs a place they can hide
Everyone needs to find peace sublime
Oh peace of mind

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Everyone needs a place they can hide
Hide away find a space to be alone
Everyone needs a place they can hide
Hide away find a space to be alone
Everyone needs a place they can hide
Everyone needs to find - peace sublime
Oh peace of mind

[Chorus]
I can't live with you
But I can't live without you
I can't let you stay
Ooh, but I can't live if you go away
I don't know just how it goes
All I know is I can't live with you

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm having a hard time
I'm walking a fine line
Between hope and despair
You may think that I don't care
But I travelled a long road
To get hold of my sorrow
I tried to catch a dream
But nothing's what it seems
Love is saying, "baby, it's all right"
When deep inside
You're really petrified
Lover turns to hater on this escalator

[Chorus]
I can't live with you
Yeah, but I can't live without you
I can't breathe if you stay
But I can't bare you to go away
I don't know what time it is
All I know is I can't live with you

[Verse 2]
We're stuck in a bad place
We're trapped in a rat race
We can't escape
Maybe there's been some mistake
We're trying to make a high score
We're walking through a closed door
And nobody's winning
We're just sinning against ourselves

[Bridge]
Hold on, baby, tell me it's all right
Anger's breaking from the hurt inside
Passions screaming hotter
Doing what we gotta do, yeah
I can't live with you
I can't live with you
I can't live, I can't live
I can't, I can't live with you
But baby, I'll never ever leave you

[Chorus]
I can't live with you
But I can't live without you
'Cause I'm in love with you
Ooh, and everything about you
I can't live with you
No, I just can't live, I just can't live
I can't live with you
Yeah, and I can't live without you
Through the madness
Through the tears
We've still got each other
For a million years, yeah!

[Outro]
Ooh, yeah
Yeah, I can't live
Without you, yeah, yeah
I can't live without you
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh, oh
I can't live without you
I can't live without you
I can't live without you
Oh, I can't live without you
Baby, baby, baby
Without you, whoa yeah
I can't live without you

[Verse 1]
When the moons rises
The dogs will howl
Look out of your window
I will be on the prowl
I am not usually
A gambling man
But oh I just want to
Hold up my hands

[Chorus]
And say I am
Taking a chance on you love
Whoa I am taking a chance on you love

[Verse 2]
I am not superstitious
And I do not wear no charm
I do not carry my heart on the sleeve of my arm
Seven years of bad luck
Please do not worry me
Cause when I look in the mirror
Here is the future I see

[Chorus]
I am taking a chance on you love
Whoa, I am taking a chance on you love

[Verse 3]
Place your bets, Better yet
Do not forget, What I said
Roll the dice, Spin the wheel
Always remember, You have got to keep it real
Do not believe in voodoo
Black magic was never my style
But I believe you do
And it will not take much time
To gather the portions
That weave your magic spell
The moon on the ocean
Has a secret to tell

[Chorus]
But anyway I am
Taking a chance on you love
Whoa I am taking a chance on you love

[x2]

[Verse 1]
If you're searching out for something
Don't try so hard
If you're feeling kind of nothing
Don't try so hard
When your problems seem like mountains
You feel the need to find some answers
You can leave it for another day
Don't try so hard

[Verse 2]
But if you fall and take a tumble
It won't be far
If you fail you mustn't grumble
Thank your lucky stars
Just savor every mouthful
And treasure every moment
When the storms are raging 'round you
Stay right where you are

[Chorus]
Oh, don't try so hard
Oh, don't take it all to heart
It's only fools, they make these rules
Don't try so hard

[Verse 3]
One day you'll be a sergeant major
Oh, you'll be so proud
Screaming out your bloody orders
Hey, but not too loud
Polish all your shiny buttons
Dress as lamb instead of mutton
But you never had to try
To stand out from the crowd

[Bridge]
Oh, what a beautiful world
This is the life for me
Oh, what a beautiful world
It's the simple life for me

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Oh, don't try so hard
Oh, don't take it all to heart
It's only fools, they make these rules
Don't try so hard

[Outro]
Don't try so hard
Don't try so hard

[Intro]

[Chorus]
Ride the wild wind
(Push the envelope don't sit on the fence)
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Ride the wild wind
(Live life on the razor's edge)
Hey, hey, hey
Gonna ride the whirlwind
It ain't dangerous enough for me

[Verse 1]
Get your head down baby (yeah)
We're gonna ride tonight
Your angel eyes
Are shining bright
I wanna take your hand
Lead you from this place
Gonna leave it all behind
Check out of this rat race

[Chorus]
Ride the wild wind (hey hey hey)
Ride the wild wind (hey hey hey)
Gonna ride the wild wind
It ain't dangerous enough for me

[Verse 2]
Tie your hair back baby
We're gonna ride tonight (yeah)

We got jerks to the right
Sometimes I get so low
I just have to ride
Let me take your hand
Let me be your guide

[Chorus]
Ooh, ride the wild wind

Hey, hey, hey
Ride the wild wind

Gonna ride and ride the whirlwind
It ain't dangerous enough for me

[Outro]
Ride the wild wind
Ride the wild wind
(Hey, hey, hey)
The wild wind
The wild wind

[Verse 1]
Once I loved a butterfly
Do not wonder how, do not ask me why
But I believed what I would have been told
All things that glitter cannot be gold

[Chorus]
Ooooo ooo yeah
All things that glitter cannot be gold

[Verse 2]
Those jealous minds conspired to say
Just let that creature fly away
How can it be she has it all
Her pride is headed for a fall

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Oh Lord, what races we run
Seeking our place in the Sun
Reaching and doping we will find the right one
Now every day a new joy brings
My butterfly grew golden wings
It seems we find as we grow old
Some things that glitter may be gold

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
So let us mind what is there to see
Before our hearts become too cold
In spite of all that we have been told
Some things that glitter may be gold

{Chorus}
Ooooo ooo yeah
Some things that glitter may be gold

[Outro]
Ooooo ooo yeah
Some things that glitter
May be gold

[Intro: Bo Burnham]
Thank you so much, I think that I probably should've, uh, ended it on a higher note
A big ending or whatever, but, uh...it's been "what.", I hope you enjoyed it-

[Spoken Word 1: Popular Girl]
Bo, oh my god
How are you? I haven't seen you since, like, Freshman year, oh my God!
You were so, like, skinny and weird back then, um...
But now you're, um...
Anyway, um, you should totally come to this party I'm having tonight with a bunch of my college friends
Um, it's gonna be off the chain-hook, it's gonna be so good
You can play some songs for us or something
Um, I've been telling everybody how good of friends we were, um, back in the day
Um, I know we never talked or hung out ever, but um...
I think that's what made our friendship so special, y'know?
Anyway, text me! Okay, bye

[Spoken Word 2: Agent]
Mister Burnham
How ya doin', good? Good
Uh, I'm a, uh, I'm an agent from out in Los Angeles
Uh, really dig your stuff man, it's out there, you know, I totally get it
Uh, and the best part about it, man, you've got all these young fans, uh, and
Which is great, because young people, they're...
They're very passionate, and they're very, uh, they're very reliable consumers
But what you've gotta do to take your career to the next level?
You've gotta cater more heavily to them, alright?
We've done studies, young people do not respond to this...
You know, "introspective" material, or these "challenges-to-the-form", you know...
Young people want jokes they can relate to, okay?
So, write a—write a silly song about Facebook, you know?
Write some jokes about Twitter, or...or sugary cereals, or...razor scooters
Relate to them!
You know, also, you've gotta reestablish your presence on the internet, buddy
Alright, it's not important whether your material's "good" or not
What's important is that you keep the Bo Burnham brand alive and well
Ya get it?
But we'll discuss more later, I know it's a lot
Uhh, my number is, uh, 310-555-...uhh, *mumbling "imaginary number"*

[Spoken Word 3: Jock Boy]
Fag!
What up, dude, what's up, how are ya man?
You've changed, bro. You've changed
I never knew you, but, um
My friend's old roommate's friend said he knew you in high school and you became a real asshole once all this "comedy" stuff started happening
What, what is it man? You think you're better than us?
You think you're better than us just cause you're tall?
Whoa, congrats man, you're tall!
Wow, it's incredible! What, you want a trophy for being tall?
You wanna... we should just give trophies to tall things
And every tree and building will have a trophy
That make sense?
Yo, why you acting all quiet and weird right now?
Yo I know why you are, it's cause you're an arrogant prick, that's why
An arrogant fuckin' prick
I once heard that you actually act quiet cause you're shy and introverted in real life
And that people shouldn't expect you to act the same way offstage as you do onstage *laughs*
Yeah...yeah, it makes no sense
Anyway, you wanna buy some weed?

Thank you Madison, goodnight, thank you, I hope you liked it, thank you
Thank you for being a part of this, thank you

[Verse 1]
Oh yeah
Have got no hope, got no idea
What to do or why I am here
I want to get my face on your T.V
I want to be heard
I want to be seen

[Pre-Chorus]
I have got nothing, no, nothing
Nothing to show
(Make me a celebrity!)

[Chorus]
I want to be
A face on T.V
(I want to be on your screen)
Then you can see
I am a C-lebrity

[Verse 2]
I want to get my features in magazines
See this creature on every street on every screen
Write my life story before I'm twenty-one
I have got to tell the world
They may say I am dumb - but er

[Pre-Chorus]
Have got nothing, no nothing
Nothing to show
(Make me a celebrity!)

[Chorus]
I want to be
A face on T.V
(I want to be on your screen)
Then you can see
I am a C-lebrity
(Yeah!)

[Verse 3]
I want to be a star in a Broadway musical
They are going to love me, I cannot sing or dance at all
Some may say I am lackadaisical and if I was real good
I would stand no chance at all - but I
I want to be
A face on T.V
(yeah, I want to be on your screen)
Then you can see
I am a C-lebrity

Then you can say
You knew me one day

Yeh

[Verse 1]
Tell me something that will ease my pain
I am living life in vain
Crying does not help me any more
Tell me something that will ease my mind
I am walking the line
Trying does not get my anywhere

[Chorus]
I wander through the night
All the stars are shining bright
Searching for a guiding light
I wander through the night

[Verse 2]
Tell me something cause I need to know
Can you teach me how to live
How to understand how to love and how to give
Anger burns in bitterness and fills me up inside
I cannot face it and there is no place I can hide

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Tell me something cause I need to know
Can you teach me how to live
How to understand how to love and how to give
Anger burns in bitterness and fills me up inside
Without your love there is nowhere I can hide

[Chorus]

[Intro]
So all you people give freely
Make welcome inside your homes
Thank God you people give freely
Don't turn your back
On the lesson of the Lord
All prime ministers (yeah)
And majesty around the world
Open your eyes, look, touch and feel
Rule with your heart
(Rule with your heart )
Live with your conscience
(Live with your conscience)

We're all God's people
(We're all God's people)

Gotta face up, better grow up
Gotta face up, better grow up
Gotta stand tall and be strong
Gotta face up, better grow up
We're all God's people
(Gotta face up, better grow up)
(Gotta face up, better grow up)
Yeah

[Bridge]
Yes, yeah
Yes, there was this magic light
I said to myself
I'd better go to bed
And have an early night
Then I, then I, then I
Then I went into a dream
Rule with your heart
And live with your conscience

[Chorus]
We're all God's people give freely (yeah)
Make welcome inside your homes
Let us be thankful, he's so incredible

[Outro]
We're all God's people
We're all God's people
We're all God's people
We're all God's people

[Intro]
The harder we play
The faster we fall
When we think that we know it all
We know nothing at all

[Verse 1]
The letter arrives
Like a bolt from the blue
So what is left of your lives
All your dreams lost to you

[Chorus]
Say it is not true
Say it today
When I open my eyes
Will it all go away
Say it is not true
Say it is not real
Cannot be happening to you
Cannot be happening to me
{Verse 2}
It is hard not to cry
It is hard to believe
So much heartache and pain
So much reason to grieve
With the wonders of science
All the knowledge we have stored
Magic cocktails for lives
People just cannot afford

{Chorus}
Say it is not true
Say it today
When I open my eyes
Will it all go away
Say it is not true
Say it is not real
Cannot be happening to you
Cannot be happening to me

Say it is not true
Say it today
When I open my eyes
Will it all go away
Say it is not true
Say it is not real
Cannot be happening to you
Cannot be happening to me
Say it is not true
Say it today
When I open my eyes
Will it all go away
Say it is not true
Say it is not real
Cannot be happening to you
Cannot be happening to me

Say it is not true
Say it today
When I open my eyes
Will it all go away
Say it is not true
Say it is not real
Cannot be happening to you
Cannot be happening to me

[Intro]
Surf is up
School is out
I got a criminal urge to
Twist and shout

[Verse 1]
I have been searching
My whole life through
For some perfect dream
Imagined in my youth

[Chorus]
Follow that dream
Surf is up – School is out
Surf is up – School is out

[Verse 2]
For a perfect life
Find a perfect girl
You got to follow that dream
To a perfect world
I have been a searcher
An adventurer too
This ride still runs
I want to ride with you
This ride still runs
Want to ride with you

[Chorus]
Follow that dream
Surf is up – School is out
Surf is up – School is out

[Verse 3]
In the town and the country
We all lay and dreamed our dreams
Then we found the world is tough
And all is not quite what it seems
Got to take it by the horns
Got to seize your precious day
Got to follow your dream

[Outro]
Follow that dream
Follow that dream
Follow that dream
Surf is up – School is out
Follow that dream
Surf's up - School's out
Surf's up
Follow that dream
Surf's up - School's out
Surf up - School's out
Follow that dream
Follow that dream

Tears are falling and I feel the pain
Wishing you were here by me

Rock of ages cleft for me let me hide myself in Thee
Let the water and the blood from Thy wounded side which fload
Thee of sin the double cure save from raft and make me pure

In my hand no prize I bring simply to Thy cross I cling
While I draw this pleading breath when my eyes shall close in death
Lord when I rise to world unknown and behold the on Thy throne
Rock of ages cleft for me let me hime myself in Thee
Let me hime myself in Thee

[Intro] (Choir)
Take a peace of my heart
Ooh ooh, take a piece of my soul
(Ooh, ooh) Let me live
Oh yeah

[Verse 1] (Freddie Mercury)
Why don't you take
Another little piece of my heart?
Why don't you take it
And break it and tear it all apart?
All I do is give and all you do is take
Baby, why don't you
Give me a brand new start?

[Chorus] (Freddie Mercury)
So let me live (so let me live)
Let me live (leave me alone)
Let me live, oh baby
And make a brand new start

[Verse 2] (Roger Taylor)
Why don't you take
Another little piece of my soul?
Why don't you shape it
And shake it 'til you're really in control?
All you do is take, all I do is give
All that I'm askin' is a chance to live

[Chorus] (Freddie Mercury)
(So let me live) so let me live
(Leave me alone) let me live, let me live
Why don't you let me
Make a brand new start

[Verse 3] (Roger Taylor)
And it's a (long hard struggle)
But you can always depend on me
And if you're (ever in trouble) hey!
You know where I will be

[Verse 4] (Brian May)
Why don't you take
Another little piece of my life?
Why don't you twist it
And turn it and cut it like a knife?
All you do is live, all I do is die
Why can't we just
Be friends, stop livin' a lie?

[Chorus] (Freddie Mercury)
So let me live (so let me live)
Let me live (leave me alone)
Please let me live
(Why don't you live a little)
Oh yeah baby

Baby, Baby
All you do is take
(Let me live) Ooh ooh, let me live
(Oh yeah, yeah) Let me live

[Intro]

[Verse 1: Freddie Mercury]
I don't want to sleep with you
I don't need the passion too
I don't want a stormy affair
To make me feel my life
Is heading somewhere
All I want is the comfort and care
Just to know that my woman
Gives me sweet mother love ah ha

[Bridge: Freddie Mercury]
I've walked too long in this lonely lane
I've had enough of this same old game
I'm a man of the world
And they say that I'm strong
But my heart is heavy
And my hope is gone
Out in the city, in the cold world outside
I don't want pity
Just a safe place to hide
Mama please, let me back inside

[Verse 2: Freddie Mercury]
I don't want to make no waves
But you can give me
All the love that I crave
I can't take it if you see me cry
I long for peace before I die
All I want is to know that you're there
You're going to give me all your sweet
Mother love ah ha (mother love)

[Verse 3: Brian May]
My body's aching, but I can't sleep
My dreams are all the company I keep
Got such a feeling as the sun goes down
I'm coming home to my sweet
Mother love

[Outro]
(Mother love, mother love
Love, love, love, love)
God works in mysterious ways
Eeeeh dop, de dop, dep dop
I think I'm going back to the things
I learned so well in my youth

[Verse 1]
This is where we are today
People going separate ways
This is the way things are now
In disarray
I read it in the papers
There's death on every page
Oh Lord, I thank the Lord above
My life has been saved
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Here we go, telling lies
Here we go (here we go)

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
We're right back
Where we started from
People going separate ways
This is the way things are now
In disarray, hey
I read it in the papers
There's death on every page, oh
Oh Lord, I thank you for my
My life has been saved

[Outro]
My life, my life has been saved
My life, my life
My life has been saved

[Intro]
I was born to love you
With every single beat of my heart
Yes, I was born to take care of you
Every single day (Day, day, day, day, day)
Alright, hey-hey!

[Chorus]
I was born to love you
With every single beat of my heart
Yes, I was born to take care of you
Every single day of my life

[Verse 1]
You are the one for me
I am the man for you
You were made for me
You're my ecstasy
If I was given every opportunity, ah
I'd kill for your love

[Verse 2]
So take a chance with me
Let me romance with you
I'm caught in a dream
And my dream's come true
It's so hard to believe
This is happening to me

[Pre-Chorus]
An amazing feeling
Coming through

[Chorus]
I was born to love you
With every single beat of my heart
Yes, I was born to take care of you, honey
Every single day of my life

Every single day (Day, day) of my life

[Outro]
Go, Woo, I love you babe (Hey!)

Love you, love you
I want to love you, hey, yeah!

(What? Ha ha ha ha)
I get so lonely, lonely, lonely, yeah
I want to love you (It's magic!)
(Love you, love you)
Yeah, give it to me

[Intro]
This could be heaven
This could be heaven
This could be heaven for everyone

[Verse 1]
In these days of cool reflection
You come to me
And everything seems alright
In these days of cold affections
You sit by me and everything's fine

[Chorus]
This could be heaven for everyone
This world could be fed
This world could be fun
This could be heaven for everyone
This world could be free
This world could be one

[Verse 2]
In this world of cool deception
Just your smile can smooth my ride
These troubled days
Of cruel rejection, hmm
You come to me
Soothe my troubled mind

[Chorus]
Yeah, this could be heaven for everyone
This world could be fed
This world could be fun
This should be love for everyone, yeah
This world should be free
This world could be one
We should bring love
To our daughters and sons
Love, love, love, this could
Be heaven for everyone

[Bridge]
You know that
This could be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven for everyone

[Verse 3]
Listen, what people do to other souls
They take their lives, destroy their goals
Their basic pride and dignity
Is stripped and torn and shown no pity
When this should be heaven for everyone

[Outro]
This could be heaven
This could be heaven
This could be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven
This could be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven
This could be heaven
This could be heaven for everyone

[Verse 1]
I'm just the pieces of the man I used to be
Too many bitter tears are raining down on me
I'm far away from home and I've been facing this alone
For much too long
Oh, I feel like no one ever told the truth to me
About growing up and what a struggle it would be
In my tangled state of mind, I've been looking back to find
Where I went wrong

[Chorus]
Too much love will kill you if you can't make up your mind
Torn between the lover and the love you leave behind
You're headed for disaster, 'cause you never read the signs
Too much love will kill you every time

[Verse 2]
I'm just the shadow of the man I used to be
And it seems like there's no way out of this for me
I used to bring you sunshine
Now all I ever do is bring you down
Ooh, how would it be if you were standing in my shoes?
Can't you see that it's impossible to choose?
No, there's no making sense of it
Every way I go I'm bound to lose

[Bridge]
Oh, yes!

[Chorus]
Too much love will kill you, just as sure as none at all
It'll drain the power that's in you, make you plead and scream and crawl
And the pain will make you crazy, you're the victim of your crime
Too much love will kill you every time

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
Yes, too much love will kill you, it'll make your life a lie
Yes, too much love will kill you and you won't understand why
You'd give your life, you'd sell your soul, but here it comes again
Too much love will kill you

[Outro]
In the end
In the end

[Intro]
Oh

You don't fool me, you don't fool me
You don't fool me, you don't fool me

You don't fool me, those pretty eyes
That sexy smile
You don't fool me, uh
You don't rule me, you're no surprise (Oh)
You're telling lies
Hey, you don't fool me
Mmm, mama said "Be careful of that girl"
Mama said "You know that she's no good"
Mama said "Be cool, don't you be no fool"
Yup bup ba ba ba ba
Da da da dah

[Chorus]
You don't fool me, you don't fool me
You don't fool me, you don't fool me

You don't fool me (Sooner or later, you'll be playing by her rules)

[Guitar Solo]
(Oh)
(Oh)

[Bridge]
Baby, you don't fool me, yeah

[Verse 2]
You don't fool me, you don't have to say don't mind
You don't have to teach me things I know
Sooner or later, you'll be playing by her rules
Oh (Fool you), oh (Rule you)
She'll take you (Take you)
And break you (Break you)
Yeah

[Bridge]
Mama said "Be cool"
Mama said "She'll take you for a fool"
She'll take you and break you
Ba ba ba ba ba bah bah bah
Da da dah dah dah

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
It's winter fall
Red skies are gleaming, oh
Seagulls are flying over
Swans are floating by
Smoking chimney tops
Am I dreaming? Am I dreaming?

[Verse 2]
The nights draw in
There's a silky moon
Up in the sky, yeah
Children are fantasizing
Grown-ups are standing by
What a super feeling
Am I dreaming?
Am I dreaming?
Woh-woh-woh-woh

[Chorus]
(Dreaming) So quiet and peaceful
(Dreaming) Tranquil and blissful
(Dreaming) There's a kind
Of magic in the air
(Dreaming) What a truly magnificent view
(Dreaming) A breathtaking scene
With the dreams of the world
In the palm of your hand

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
(Dreaming) A cozy fireside chat
(Dreaming) A little this, a little that
(Dreaming) Sound of merry
Laughter skippin' by
(Dreaming) Gentle rain beatin' on my face
(Dreaming) What an extraordinary place!
And the dream of the child
Is the hope of, the hope of the man

[Verse 3]
It's all so beautiful
Like a landscape painting
In the sky, yeah!
Mountains are zooming higher, uh
Little girls scream and cry
My world is spinning
And spinning, and spinning
It's unbelievable, sends me reeling
Am I dreaming?
Am I dreaming?

[Outro]
Oooh

Mhm mhm when you left I shed a million teardrops over you

Someone I'm going to have around me for a long long while
Someday we may meet again but I won't fall for you

Gotta get rid of this feeling, I'm feeling done
Yes, I've gotta get rid of this feeling that's under my tongue (Keyset)

This Town

[Verse]
This town is not for me
I won't be staying around
This town is hard and cold
I'm not happy in this town
I'll pick up my heart and I'll go
Where to I don't care or know
Don't matter where I'll be found
As long as I leave this town
This town wants me to go
It ain't where I was bound
This town don't need me here
I don't need this town

[Outro]
To morrow who'll remember my name
To morrow who'll remember I came
Don't care which road I'll go down
As long as it's a way from this town

[Verse 1]
With the morning I face the sun
I lift my head and smile for everyone
Every afternoon you'll find me working on
I got my new shoes on
Got to be moving on
(That's what they say)
Every night I'm tossed
And I shake my fevered brow
Thinking of my lost opportunity
Yes every morning I face the sun
I get so positive with everyone
And every afternoon
You'll find the cracks showing through
They know what I'm going through
(Oh yes they do)
Every evening finds me
The optimist behind me
Gone with my lost opportunity

[Verse 1]
God bless my soul here he comes now
The man with the most, how does he do it?

Anything, anything

Amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found was blind but now I see
Twas grace that taught my heart to fear and grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear the hour I first believed
When we've been there ten thousand years bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise than when we'd first begun

[Intro: Storyteller]
And the spirit of John moved upon the face of the waters;
And John said "Let there be light" and there was light;
And John saw that it was good

[Interlude 1: Lana Del Rey]
Dear John forgive us our sins, dear John forgive us our sins
Dear John forgive us our sins, dear John forgive us our sins
Dear John forgive us our sins, dear John forgive us our sins
Dear John forgive us our sins, dear John forgive us for our sins
Creator of all forgive us our sins, dear John forgive us our sins
Dear John forgive us our sins
Thank you God

[Interlude 2: John Wayne, Elvis Presley, Marilyn Monroe & Jesus]
I wanna tell you where you're at, you lose me in this campsite, and I'm gonna teach you how to be cowboys;
Now, if you wanna be tough cowboys I don't wanna hear ya' crying, I don't wanna hear ya' bellyaching, you gotta get on that horse and ride; (And I guess I'll never find you)
And don't be afraid, wear your boats up high, your pant low; (Sex is a part of nature, I go along with the nature)
with your head in a good way, (You're always on my mind, you're always on my mind)
And when you get on there don't be jerkin' on it, just ride nice and soft
You can do it; (Earth is missing, distant from us)
I believe in ya', ride with the wind, (Oh I must have you, or no one) (Forgive us, distant...)
don't complain and never say you're sorry, sorry is a sign of weakness, (Forgive us intense, please forgive those distant...)
I don't want you go back to your mama because I'll run you back out (And lead us not into temptation) (I want you to kiss me) (I love you)
You're a good kid, all you lil' cowboy will do a good job for me
make sure you do it children, 'cause I'll be watching you
(Life can change on a dime, sometimes you just have to gain) (Yeah baby, that's what it is, that is what is all about) (Amen)
Don't forget, I'll write to your mama (I don't lie)

[Body Electric]

(Noooo)

[Interlude 3: Lana Del Rey & Elvis Presley]
I sing the Body electric;
The armies of those I love engirt me, and I engirt them;
They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them, (Man you've got to be crazy!)
And discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the Soul

[Interlude 4: Lana Del Rey]
Womanhood, and all that is woman - and the man that comes from woman
The womb, the tits, nipples, breast-milk, tears, laughter, weeping, love-looks, love-perturbations and rising
The voice, articulation
Language
Whispering, shouting aloud
Food, drink, pulse, digestion, sweat, sleep
Walking, swimming, poise on the hips
Leaping, reclining, embracing, arm-curving and tightening
The continual changes of the flex of the mouth
And around the eyes
The skin, the sun-burnt shade, freckles, hair
The curious sympathy one feels, when feeling with the hand the naked meat of the body
The circling rivers, the breath, and breathing it in and out
The beauty of the waist, and thence of the hips, and thence downward toward the knees
The thin red jellies within you or within me - the bones and the marrow in the bones
The exquisite realization of health;
Oh I say, these are not the parts and poems of the Body only, but of the Soul
Oh I say now, these are the Soul!

[Gods and Monsters]

(Oh I must have you, or no one)

[Spoken 1: Lana Del Rey & Shaun Ross]
- "You know it's not always gonna be this way, right?"
- "Yeah.."
- "So just chill, alright?"
- "Mhmm"
- "Alright.."
