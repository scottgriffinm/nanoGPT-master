inning

[Chorus: Eminem]
I thought I heard a voice in my head that said "Kill"
I had no other choice that was left except fill
My pencil full of poisonous lead, the devil
He wants me to murder this beat, so I will
He told me there are doubters who question my skill
They wanna put my style to the test, am I still
The best? They want the crown on my head, I said, "Chill
If you want me to murder this beat, then I will"

[Outro: Eminem]
And I don't think that I can stop it (Here it comes)
I do my best to try to block it (Redrum)
I've been sipping on like, vodka (Head's numb)
I'm blacking out, you better watch it (It's bedlam)

[Spoken]
How do you do? Ladies and gentlemen
My name is Alfred Hitchcock and this is Music To Be Murdered By
It is mood music in a jugular vein
So why don't you relax? Lean back and enjoy yourself
Until the coroner comes

[Intro: Anderson .Paak]
Yeah, like that
Okay, yeah

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak & Eminem]
Say, bro, (Yeah) where you get them from?
Detroit? (Yeah) That machine gun, spray boy
And it's gon' hit some
New coupe? (Ooh) Been whippin' 'em
New boobs? (Yeah) Where you get them done?
Payroll (Nice), might put you on a table
And spread you out like some Yayo (I'm naughty, yah)
No, bitch (Oh), you don't know shit (No)
You just want all my money, ah
I was hopeless (Oh), now I'm focused (No)
Where the fuck is the party at?
Now hold this (Oh), oh shit (Oh)
That's it (Yeah), so sick (Oh)
No shit (Oh)
Damn, I'm (Yeah) getting too fuckin' old for this (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
But still as explosive with, just load the clip
Two pistols on hip, both are gripped
I hold them at shoulder width
Took a stab in the dark and broke the tip
Of my knife off, but your throat is slit
'Cause I'm cutthroat to the utmost with it
The ultimate
I just let the poker chips fall where they were supposed to fit
Now those days are over, scrapin' change in sofas
Tryna save at Kroger (Yeah)
So why would I give a fuck about backstabbin' Trader Joe for?
How 'bout that, I'm paid as Oprah
Think I may have broke the scale
'Cause the wait is over
But wait, wait, hold up, 'cause they say I almost

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
I almost lost it
I had to reach back, back, and lock it, yeah (Lock it, lock it)
You almost got me (Stop it, stop it)
I had to reach back, back, and lock it, yeah (Lock it, lock it)
You almost (Stop it), you almost (Stop it), you almost (Stop it), but I got it (I got it)
You almost (Stop it), you almost (Stop it), you almost (Stop it), I got it (I got it)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So sit there and act pathetic and sulk
'Cause I'm getting green, Incredible Hulk
'Cause I usually get it in bulk
But I still will stomp your head to a pulp (Yeah)
You want smoke, I got the tical like Method Man
So get ready to die from second hand
Get a whiff of the doctor's medicine
Like sedatives you'll get popped, Excedrin
'Cause you can get it like over the counter (Yo)
Like I just left the damn concession stand (Yeah)
A mic in my hand's a weapon (What?)
I put that on everything like ranch, I'll never land
I'm too fly, I don't plan to ever Cinderella Man
What I am is better than
Every single one of you
Whether separate or all of you band together
And I put the game on the pill (Yeah)
Now my Shady babies are all stillborns
Meaning abortions that live 'cause they were still born
I can heal 'em with Neosporin
You 'bout to experience euphoria
(I'm a) true warrior, got the plug like Trugoy
You give me the cue like I'm ScHoolboy
And I'll treat the beat like a pitbull would do to a chew toy and destroy it, 'cause, boy, I

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
I almost lost it
I had to reach back, back, and lock it, yeah (Lock it, lock it)
You almost got me (Stop it, stop it)
I had to reach back, back, and lock it, yeah (Lock it, lock it)
You almost (Stop it), you almost (Stop it), you almost (Stop it), but I got it (I got it)
You almost (Stop it), you almost (Stop it), you almost (Stop it), I got it (I got it)

[Intro]
Ricky Racks
For what it's worth
You were a slut at birth
If the world had a dick
You'd fuck the Earth
I tried to get over you
It doesn't work
You're still a cunt
I'm still a fucking jerk

[Verse 1]
Same as it ever was, yeah
Say it'll change but it never does
Ain't gonna ever 'cause
You're the cause of my pain and the medicine
Never met someone who played games with my head as much
Fate tethered us together like two felons
Must've fell in love with skeletons
Everyone's got 'em, thought that you were Cinderella but (Yeah)
Feels like I slept with the (Uh) wicked stepmother
But how the hell am I
Still in love with the motherfucking chick there's at least a million of?
They say love the one you with
But this shit is killing us
Our love's on some other shit
I'm a glutton for punishment
You're the gloves, I'm the punching mitts
It's above and beyond us
Cuffing, I'm shoving the girl I love inside of an oven
If I catch you sucking another dick
You better unsuck it, you snuck in the crib and tried to jump under the covers again
Why am I tucking you in?
Probably 'cause

[Chorus]
I gotta tell myself another lie
'Cause that's what helps to get me by
'Cause I'm in Hell
This is my goodbye, farewell

[Verse 2]
Wanna hold you, wanna choke you, wanna love you
Wanna hate you, wanna kill you, wanna hurt you
Wanna heal you, yeah
Wanna lose you, keep you, bruise you
Beat, abuse you, treat you mutual
It's juvenile, delusional, as usual
You're beautiful, I'm average (Woo)
I'm brutal, you're a savage
My ride or die chick who's always cruising for a bruising
Yeah, it's kinda like we're tryna light a dynamite stick
Though we might get along like shit
Fight, hit, bite, spit, unite, split
Yeah, you're awful, but you're mine
And they say love is blind, we see each other fine
But it's no wonder I'm (Yeah) the only one you'll find (Uh)
To put up with your shit (What?), I need a plumber line (Yeah)
But nothing comes to mind (Nah) besides the number 90 (No)
'Cause since '06 you flipped my fucking life, upside down
Now the sky's ground, look at my frown, it's a smile now
Look at my mouth, it's my eyebrows, make it rain upwards
We're on that ninth cloud, two insane lovebirds
I should fly south, 'cause man am I great, ain't lyin' to myself
But I'm just plain stubborn, I'm Audi five thou'
But this is my house, bitch, you get out
Then we duke it out, then it dies down
Then we say, "Fuck it", cry our eyes out
Then...

[Chorus]
I gotta tell myself another lie
'Cause that's what helps to get me by
'Cause I'm in Hell
This is my goodbye, farewell

[Verse 3]
This relationship is all that it's cracked up to be
Never lack lust in that 'cause we act nuts
'Cause that's what attracts us
Trick you with a back rub
Tell you to relax then dump your ass in the bathtub (Haha)
Yeah, now that's love, may sound pathetic
But fuck the world 'cause they out to get us
I love you but I won't exchange vows
Hey now, don't get carried away
No way I'll get married, it'll take a rain cloud to wed us
Yeah, but we're so insane ‘bout each other
May take the same route and way out as Junior Seau
Break out Berettas, lay down in bed and blow our brains out together
Who knows how it's gonna play out?
Or whether death's what our ending will be
One of us shot in the back while attempting to flee
But I'll go to bat for you, defending your honor
Yeah, no contingency fees, something we’re not, nah
We're not pretending to beef, don't cost a penny to be with me
Time we're spending is free, we could be broke as a joke
Won't make a difference to me, don't have to give me a thing
Could've been a 50 cent ring from out of a vending machine
Love unconditionally, there's no other fish in the sea
Guess I'm a prisoner, see, addiction is a disease

[Chorus]
I gotta tell myself another lie
'Cause that's what helps to get me by
'Cause I'm in Hell
This is my goodbye, farewell

[Outro]
Love you girl, do you feel the same?
I don't wanna play games, no games, ah
You're the only one that can out my flame
Baby, just play it straight, straight, no games, ah

[Intro: Young M.A & Eminem]
Oh, this what we doin'? Alright
M.A

[Verse 1: Young M.A]
I like a bitch that like to wobble, wobble
Shake it, shake it, break it, break it, uh
Nigga, we made it, made it, they hate it, hate it
Pro professional, pure persistent, I'm paper chasing
I hate complaining, I hated waiting, I'll pay for patience
But I hate to pay a bill (Hate that)
And I made a mil' without a major deal (I made that)
Yeah, her ass fake, but she came for real (She came, uh)
Money ain't a thing, that ain't a thing for real
It's the broke lingo (Huh)
And no, ain't nothing Saweetie, this is no Quavo (Migo)
Man, I just get high, let my hoes lay low (Ooh)
I just want some face but this is no facial (Ooh)
Do right and kill er'body, Drake mode (Hello)
Bitch, I'm tryna eat out, take your plate mode (Hello)
Disrespect that life and I'm in gang mode (Grrr)
You can leave this earth, bitch, I'm in rake mode (Huh)
I'm in cake mode (Huh), I'm in brave mode, uh
What up, Marshall? I'm a martian, I'm in Wayne mode (Facts)
Neck wet, big drip, I'm in rain mode (Drip, drip, drip)
Eight niggas, eight hittas, take eight souls (Brrr)
Collect pesos (Huh), and I'm paid, so? (Paid)
Self-made goals (Hey)
When the pain leaves (Huh)
Where does the pain go? (Where?)
Tip of the backwood is where the flame goes (There)
To the sky is where my brain goes (Wow)
Same pack, same fiend, sellin' the same clothes (Wow)
Pinocchio and my pistol, they got the same nose
Me and my niggas gotta eat, we share the same stove (What?)
Case closed, bodies in my lane, bitch, lane closed

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Game over, Thanos on you H-O's
On my petty shit but I don't paint toes (Yeah)
Get the plunger (Plunger) 'cause Marshall and M.A go plum crazy
Call us liquid plumber, 'cause even Dre know (Dre know)
Beat knocks like a beefed up Detox
You're gonna need three squads of police officers at least to come pull me off of it and I don't stop
Please, dawg, I need y'all to keep talking shit 'cause I feed off of it
I am the complete opposite of these retards who spit these weak bars, I'ma leave carnage
Each thought'll be so toxic, it'll block the wind through your esophagus
Stop it, cutting off your oxygen
And I hit them pads like a boxing gym
Better watch for Slim, better get to popping and when I'm at the top again
I won't topple, I'm giving it to anyone who wanna come and get it and I'm not gonna stop
But when they ask me is the war finished with MGK? Of course it is
I cleansed him of his mortal sins, I'm God and the Lord forgives even the devil worshippers
I'm moving on but you know your scruples are gone when you're born with Lucifer's horns
And you're from the school of Notorious, Puba, Cube and The Poor Righteous Teachers tutored my students
Showed them all the blueprint and formula
But it seems like the more they studied my music, the more they remind me of eyeballs
I'm watching my pupils get cornier (Uh)
But I'm contemplating yelling "Bombs away" on the game
Like I'm outside of an Ariana Grande concert waiting

[Chorus: Eminem]
They call me Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini
Where's Osama been? I been laden lately
Look at how I'm behaving, they want me gone away
They wanna JonBenét me (Fuck you), I'm unaccommodating

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Man, I don't see why they hate me (Huh?)
I'm a clown like John Wayne Gacy (What?)
They call me Kanye crazy (Yah)
APESHIT, Beyonce, Jay-Z (Woo)
And I'm back with Andre, baby (Yeah)
And the doctor's operating (What?)
But he never put no scrubs on from Snoop, K. Dot to Shady
Shady like a shadow or your silhouette, intellect, I better check to see why you feel upset
'Cause I met your bitch on the internet now I'm getting head like a Pillow Pet
That bimbo can put her lips all the way around this bone and then blow
Like a dusty cartridge from an old Nintendo
Those were the days but I bet you, I'm never gonna be broke again, no
I don't smoke but I got paper, to be blunt, I'm rolling Indo
And I keep it one comma, zero, zero, zero, zero
Real, real, real, murder, murder, murder, kill, kill, kill
Nickel-plated, twenty two, two, two
Bitch, shut the fuck up 'fore I shoot you too
Ain't shit I won't do just to get a few YouTube views
Run up in a church like pew, pew, pew
'Cause that's what I do, do, do
But, even to the untrained human eye
We ain't the same, you and I
Somebody should have explained to you why
For you to go against me, it's simply insane, you will die (Yeah)
That's why they call me Kamikaze, it's plain suicide, yeah
But I know magic and here go my last trick
I'm 'bout to say "Abracadabra" and pull a B Rabbit up out of my hat
I'm about to relapse and I betcha that you won't know how to react
But a look of disgust, I don't doubt it'd be that
As I begin to fuckin' devour the track
And you backpedal, that is a cowardly act
Like a Saudi attack when the towers collapsed

[Chorus: Eminem]
They call me Saddam Hussein, Ayatollah Khomeini
Where's Osama been? I been laden lately
Look at how I'm behaving, they want me gone away
They wanna JonBenét me (Fuck you), I'm unaccommodating

[Chorus: White Gold]
Pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn
You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn
But I pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn
Pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn
You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn
But I pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn

[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9"]
I'm a product of properly hoppin' up out of that poverty
Profitin' all for coppin' and swappin' that property out for a possible monopoly
Try not to adopt my father's old philosophies
Same time I'm prayin' to God that everything works out at his colonoscopy
I'm walkin' across a suicidal tightrope intentionally
While the demons comin' out of me
Wifey's on the side of me talkin' sense into me
Without she, I feel incomplete mentally, she's been sent to me
Right there since '9-6, worse nightmare to side chicks, some things are just meant to be
This it for me, give my daughters a kiss for me
Y'all call this fame, I call this shit alcoholistic infamy
Targettin' my kids and babies through population and gun control
Shit make me wanna make a hunnid more
Make a bigot racist uncomfortable
If y'all against talk and reparation then I'm not against the thought of separation
While the politicians that are white and privileged ask how is this different from segregation, that's funny bro
Segregation is bein' told where I'm gonna go
Separation is bein' woke and goin' wherever I wanna go

[Chorus: White Gold]
Pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn
You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn
But I pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn
Pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn
You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn
But I pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Never sold dope for no gold rope
Wanted one though, they were so dope (Yeah)
Was a have-not (Yeah) 'cause my pockets (Uh)
Didn't have knots, I was so broke
On my last rock, for my slingshot
Better haul ass, don't be no slow poke (Nope)
Through the tall grass, run your ass off (Yeah)
Oh no, got your pants caught on the fence post
Getting chased, by them Jackboys, think it's 'bout to fuzz
Like a lint roller they wait 'til it's late, they will tiptoe
Through your living room window
Take your Nintendo and then skate
Making you feel like you got bent over and raped
Little boy, you're never gonna get no rope chain
Get your shit stole, and your lip swole, I became bitter
As I got a little bit older, my hate
Was making me get cold, and began to get a chipped shoulder
Started to spit vulgar, my ZIP code had been skid row
But I ate every single beat that I spit over, the shithole I escaped
Then I began to explode, detonate, now the Eastside went schizo
Thought my name was B-side 'cause they flipped over my tape
And I won't hesitate
To get 'em all bent so outta shape
Oh shit, bro, hold up, wait
I just tripped over my cape (Superman)
And I'm not gonna let up, treat the paper like I'm chopping a letter
Dre'll tell you how I shred
So when you refer to the guy next to the doc, you meant shredder
Now the cops wanna set up roadblocks on my head, I
Got several bounties from feds in every county
I'm with a gal at a Checkers wiling
Bumping "Fuck Da Police" while I fed her Rally's
This shit is like Romper Room
Why do I feel responsible for these kids?
All of whom I'm a father to
I'm a God to you, y'all better worship the water I walk on
Or y'all gonna meet your Waterloo
I get to flippin' the mic' as a murder weapon
I'm poppin' an extra clip, then cock and shoot, then I'm popping
Do not let me catch you slippin'
I will pop up and I'll take a spot from you
I'll get to doing what a leaky faucet do
But I ain't talkin' drip when I say that I'll get the drop on you
Singin' fuck all of you in Autotune
I am too volatile and too grizzly to bear
Yeah, shit is gettin' to where I can barely even sit in a chair
I bust my ass for this shit and I swear
It ain't even worth dissing someone so offbeat
That they can't even figure out where their words
Should hit the kick and the snare

[Chorus: White Gold]
Pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn
You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn
But I pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn
Pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn
All them pretty bitches leave yo' ass in the urn
You ain't sold your last rock, you just better earn
But I pray you see tomorrow little boy, you gon' learn

[Verse 1]
"This could never work," is what we said at first
But whatever this is, it's working
But we're in two different worlds and (Yeah)
I'm not your husband (Nah), you ain't my girlfriend
All I know is that (What?)
When I'm with you, I'm a different person, yeah
And I ain't never met a chick as perfect
Girl, you're a ten, so here I am (Yeah)
Laying here with her again
Thinking 'bout you
She's asleep, you're texting me around two
Crying face emoji, you say, "This is me without you"
We're sneaking out to meet at cheap hotel rooms or
Sex in the car, then I'll text you tomorrow
Do I question it? Nah, no objection at all
'Cause both of us are still involved, so
As I'm peelin' off, all I'm thinking 'bout is

[Chorus]
I'm not happy here (Nah), with her
Rather have you (Yeah), rather have me too
'Cause you're not happy there (You're not happy there), with him
Rather have me (I know, but), we’re just in too deep

[Verse 2]
You're laying there with him, thinking 'bout me
He's asleep, you say, "Let's meet around three"
You went to leave the house, he caught you sneaking out, now he's freaking out
You thought he was sleepin' soundly, woah
You say you're going for a drive, you don't question him
When he stumbles in, like, "Where the fuck you've been?"
Then you pump his ear with what he wants to hear
Tell him you love him, yeah, wipe each other's tears
But it's been a couple years since we been doin' dirt
You or my girl, don't wanna see either of you get hurt
But now the lines are getting super blurred
Can't tell if I'm cheating on her with you or cheating on you with her
But really, nobody's at fault, can't help who you love
Hope they don't overhear us talk
'Cause we both are getting sloppy
Probably subconsciously part of me's hoping we get caught 'cause

[Chorus]
I'm not happy here (Nah), with her
Rather have you (Yeah), rather have me too
'Cause you're not happy there (You're not happy there), with him
Rather have me (I know, but), we’re just in too deep

[Verse 3]
We're laying here with them, thinking 'bout us
'Cause now when we get home, we get jealous
Of each other being someone else's
Call us Long John Silver's 'cause we selfish
But I just wanna see ya
Don't care if it's at the Ritz or Motel 6
If I'm there with ya, rich or poor
When I'm laying here with ya, it could be the kitchen floor
I could stay in bed with ya starin' at ya 'til the morn'
I just wanna be your secret lover, yeah
I'd rather share ya than to not have you at all
So once a year or twice a month I'm here if you want it
Yeah, I'm open season
And I'm always game, so I keep it a hundred, dear, haha
'Cause we could never be each other's everythings, you got a wedding ring
So it's him instead of me, but I'll be your second string, now and forever because

[Chorus]
I'm not happy here (Nah), with her
Rather have you (Yeah), rather have me too
'Cause you're not happy there (You're not happy there), with him
Rather have me (I know, but), we’re just in too deep (I'm in way too deep)

[Intro: dEnAun]
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah (People)
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah (Bitches)
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah (Animals)
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah

[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9"]
Bumstickitty, bumstickitty, bum huh
I got that old rum-pum-pum-pum
A punk'll jump up to get him a beat down
At least sound, I sound like these clowns, like he sound
My flow all over the place, four-four in the waist, I'm so, so innovative
Po-po in the way, I'll roll over 'em and make bacon
And call 'em a pig, won't you hop up off of my dick?
Words in the way, I'm at loss by him
I give you a JFK on the front lawn of MLK in the crossfire (Get down, nigga)
I have evolved into the lost diaries of the mob and the Rothschilds (C'mon)
I feel like God broke the vials and I am just layin' down inside 'em like caulk and tile (Q-Tip)

[Chorus: Q-Tip, Royce da 5'9" & dEnAun]
Man, here we go
I said that we live in the land of criminal
My era, my era, my era so original
Uh-huh, I survived it and that's a miracle, ah, man
'Cause I'm from Slaughterhouse (People), check yourself
Like Ice Cube said, "Before you wreck yourself" (Bitches)
Like Wu-Tang said, "You should protect yourself" (Animals)
I got 'em goin'
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah (Get down, nigga)
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Yo, snappin' necks plus I'm live, in effect
I'm in the Slick Rick eye patch, but I got it from Hex
Rappers avoid eye contact, that's outta respect
For the god in the flesh, the ominous Indominus Rex
They be like, "You put the Thought on? Yikes"
If I told y'all once, I told y'all twice, that motherfucker is nice
I'm the king of the blood sport on mics
I'm from an era you had beef, y'all prolly fist fought on sight
Get your ass beat at the basketball court on spite
Then tell your wife to put your life support on ice
I'm the rap Pernell Whitaker, the honorable minister
Leavin' every amateur inoperable, I finished 'em
Makin' plaques outta they head like dead venison
Used to be the bad lieutenant with M-Illitant
Spillin' over fabulous jams my man Dilla sent
Rap speak for me, I am the ventriloquist
I'm so stubborn, the government won't govern
That brother you spoke of, it just wasn't as dope, was it?
I'm cold buzzin', I never been low budget
The taste of your own medicine, here come a dose of it
I break free like Chesimard
Keep 'em guessin' hard while broads say my bars is like ASMR
All my dogs is out the reservoir
Top five, I'm where the legends are (Keep goin')
Live at the edge of darkness and light
One phone call, my youngins takin' flight
You a bark bitch, and never bite, long kiss goodnight
I stay heated, my people in the place need it
If you ain't standin' up for yourself, then stay seated
And they cheated, they lie like Amerigo Vespucci
I'm a miracle, I'm still super lyrical
Live from the Terrordome, loud like a megaphone
Thutmose the Third with seven inch herringbones

[Chorus: Q-Tip, Royce da 5'9" & dEnAun]
Man, here we go
I said that we live in the land of criminal
My era, my era, my era so original
Uh-huh, I survived it and that's a miracle, ah, man
'Cause I'm from Slaughterhouse (People), check yourself
Like Ice Cube said, "Before you wreck yourself" (Bitches)
Like Wu-Tang said, "You should protect yourself" (Animals)
I got 'em goin'
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah (Get down, nigga)
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Better hope an ambulance is en route
Papers are hand grenades soon as I pull the pin out
I am the Santa Fe, Mandalay and Orlando and Colorado and Columbine
All combined into one, I don't walk a line, bitch, I run
'Cause we don't got no time to waste, so come on Denaun
Here come me, 5-to-9 and Thought, da-dun, da-dun
Then like a shotgun I'm ready to cock it on 'em
Leave these pussies stretched out like the Octomom
Never had no trouble keepin' up with the times
I just adapt to the climate, I treat it like my Levi's
When they ain't buttoned up right, I adjust on the fly
Middle fingers, put 'em high, that's why they call it a bird
'Cause you put it up in the sky
And I'm like a spider crawlin' up your spinal column
I'm climbin' all up the sides of the asylum wall
And dive in a pile of Tylenol, you're like a vagina problem
To a diabolical gynecologist tryna ball a fist, I will
Fuck you, just buy me, double timing the rhyming
I leave you stymied, that's why they still vilify me like Bill O'Reilly
I'ma show you what I mean when they call me the Harvey Weinstein of 2019
I'm a conniving, when I'm on the mic I'ma standout
Like a lime green wife beater with a knife out
I'm a sight to see, but you can see from the ring I'm wearing
Me and this game, we got married already
Had the prenup ready, fucked on her, should've seen her belly
She barely was three months pregnant
Bitch had it, gave me a baby, we named it Machine Gun Kelly
Now here's to LL, Big L and Del
K-Solo, Treach, and G Rap
DJ Polo, Tony D, ODB, Moe Dee, Run-DMC
Ed O.G. , and EPMD, D.O.C., Ice-T, Evil Dee
King Tee, UTFO, and Schoolly D, PE, and BDP
YZ and Chi-Ali, Rakim and Eric B., they were like my therapy
From B.I.G. and Paris, Three Times Dope, and some we'll never see, and PRT
N.W.A and Eazy-E, and D-R-E was like my GPS
Without him, I don't know where I'd be

[Chorus: Q-Tip, Royce da 5'9" & dEnAun]
Man, here we go
I said that we live in the land of criminal
My era, my era, my era so original
Uh-huh, I survived it and that's a miracle, ah, man
'Cause I'm from Slaughterhouse (People), check yourself
Like Ice Cube said, "Before you wreck yourself" (Bitches)
Like Wu-Tang said, "You should protect yourself" (Animals)
I got 'em goin'
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah (Get down, nigga)
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah

[Skit]
Get up
Dad, what?
What'd I fuckin' tell you about turnin' off the lights? (What, what? I didn't do it)
Don't fuckin' lie to me, I told you fuckin' don't touch, turn the fuckin' lights off (Stop, I didn't do it)
Don't you fuckin' lie, you little fucker (No, ah, ah)
Don't you fuckin' lie to me (Stop)

[Intro]
My name is Marsh and this world, I'm out of it (Out of it)
'Cause with all this A-B-C shit, I'm starting to sound like ALF a bit
Ha, I kill me, this medicine's counterfeit
I was mislead by the sound of it, how am I gonna get turnt up on this Valium shit? (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Checked in at the Royal Garden
To chill and avoid my problems
Until paranoia caused me
To feel like I'm going bonkers
For real, think my toilet's talkin'
I spilled like, like forty bottles
Of pills, think your boy is startin'
To feel like a spoiled carton of milk
'Cause it just occurred
My girl's cheatin', I'm kickin' that fucking bitch to the curb
But the word "fucking" ain't meant to be a descriptive word
The type of bitch she is, ain't no adjective, it's a verb
Ho thinks her snatch is magical
But that's how she attracts men, though
Traps 'em and attack similar to an actual arachnid
Or a vaginal tarantula or black widow
In fact, it'll be nothin' to throw that lil' bitch with a capital B out the back window
Of the black Cadillac limo like a whack demo
When I'm strapped, when I spit rapid, like a ratchet
A halfwit, I'll aim at, then I'll
Been fire bitch, I can outrap Reynolds
A pad and pen'll be great, but a napkin'll do
Return of the whack sicko
Head spinnin' like Invisibl Skratch Piklz
Yeah, Shady's back, see the bat signal
It's time to go bat shit, like you accidentally ate a Louisville slugger and crapped it
I'd like to introduce myself
Hi there, bitch...

[Chorus]
My name is Marsh and, I'm out this world (This world)
S on my chest (Superman) like it's plural (It's lit)
Call me extra, extraterrestrial
Extra, extra, extraterrestrial (Skrrt, yeah)

[Verse 2]
I could keep beefin', fuck is the point?
I could make it really difficult for motherfuckers to come to Detroit
If you're still looking for smoke, I already gave you an L
I'd rather just see you in Hell, but I should get Puff on the joint (Diddy)
Wait, run it back, I said give you an L, inhale
Puff on the joint, I am the blunt you avoid
Used to get jumped for my ProWings
When I was growing up they said a Slinky's a wonderful toy
My mother thought I was such a fun little boy
"Oh, what a bundle of joy"
Until the morning she suffered a punch in the groin
From a tantrum I was throwing
Like a motherfuckin' disgruntled employee
I don't cut the beat 'til I fuckin' destroy it
Once I get going, rain, thunder, it's storming
Puddles are forming, I hear somebody's voice
In my head, say it's still a dream
Then he said kill emcees
Trippie Redd, with pills and lean
Sipping meds in the limousine
Getting head, guillotine

[Chorus]
My name’s Marsh and, I'm out this world (This world)
S on my chest (Superman) like it's plural (It's lit)
Call me extra, extraterrestrial (Yeah)
Extra, extra, extraterrestrial

[Verse 3]
Yeah
So all of y'all can just suck a penis (Suck a penis)
I'll do the opposite (I'll do the opposite)
Eat you pussies like cunnilingus (Like cunnilingus)
There ain't no stoppin' it (There ain't no stoppin' it)
They say I'm such a genius (They say I'm such a genius)
When that Kamikaze hit (When that Kamikaze hit)
Now they call me "butterfingers" (They call me "butterfingers")
'Cause I just keep droppin' shit (I just keep droppin' shit)
You wanna butt heads? Shut up, Beavis, haha
I got your bitch with her butt out
I'm hittin' a lick 'cause she stickin' her tongue out (Bitch)
You got no hitters, you might be pitchin' a shut out
She 'bout to give up the dugout (Yeah)
I should just live in a nuthouse
Right now, I live in an igloo (Yeah)
And I'm not chillin' the fuck out
Treat you like a stepparent, does to a stepchild with red hair and
Plus I get dough like Ed Sheeran, so call me the ginger bread man
I'm a stan of Redman, X-Clan and I'm a Treach fan
But I look up to myself (Yeah)
Like a fucking headstand (Yeah)
So why, w-w-w-why else would I call myself an alien?
How could I hit a dry spell? (Yeah), I'm named after the wetlands

[Chorus]
I'm Marsh and, I'm out this world (This world)
S on my chest (Superman) like it's plural (It's lit)
Call me extra, extraterrestrial (Yeah)
My name is Marsh and, my name is, my name is
My name is Marsh

[Verse 1]
I could be with anybody, I choose you
Still, it's no excuse to abuse you
But no one knows what I'm goin' through, so I'd use you
To be truthful, I wouldn't know what to do if I lose you
So I refuse to, might have a screw loose and a fuse blew
But I think I might be buildin' up a tolerance to you
'Cause one minute I'm hollerin', "Screw you"
Next, I take it back, guess you can say I'm tryna unscrew you
But the shit's about to pop off, yeah, I feel you up
Then I got you totally open as soon as I take your top off
You're so hard to resist, you knock my socks off
My friends say you're bad for me, hogwash

[Chorus]
I'll never love again
The way I loved you
Did you find someone new?
Are you doin' this with them?
'Cause I remember when
Still remember when you was mine, yeah
We were inseparable at one time, yeah
You know my love for you was undying, yeah
Used to always have my back

[Verse 2]
Some days it feels like you're all that I have
That's why I'm tryna hold onto you for as long as I can
And you just want me for my money so I got you wrapped all in saran
Damn, talk about eatin' out the palm of my hand
But if not for my financials
I wouldn't have you anyways, there have been ample
Plenty days, where I'm just in a daze and I can't pull
Myself up out this rut and you're so much of a handful
I can only take so much of you all at one time
Because too much of you's just too much to swallow sometimes
Gotta take you in doses, but when you're not at my side
I shake in convulsions, separation anxiety 'cause we may be the closest
Yeah, baby, we hopeless, don't we make an atrocious
Combination? We know, it's like playin' with explosives
Quite dangerous though, but my brain's in hypnosis
Such a wide range of emotions
Migraines, but why the fuck am I takin' these MOTRINs?
Ibuprofens, like a drop of rain in the ocean
And you're my fix on the days when I'm broken
But the shit's about to go sideways, I just know it

[Chorus]
I'll never love again
The way I loved you
Did you find someone new?
Are you doin' this with them?
'Cause I remember when
Still remember when you was mine, yeah
We were inseparable at one time, yeah
You know my love for you was undying, yeah
Used to always have my back

[Verse 3]
So I spiral downwardly 'cause I'm too cowardly to leave you
Head is clouded in a fallacy, but in reality
Somehow it seems like when I lay me down to sleep I'm counting sheep
You're bound to creep
'Cause every time I turn around, you keep runnin' out on me
You're my Xanax and my valium, I'm an addict, you're a downer
You're my habit, it's like I found you in the cabinet
But it's like I can't uncap it 'cause it's childproof
A scoundrel and fiend's how I feel around you
Awful, every time I lost you, felt like I had you in my pocket
Now I'm flippin' over the furniture, punchin' holes in the walls through
Everything that we've gone through
How many times you've fucked me
But the way it felt for me to be on top when I was on you
Swore my fealty, but word to G.O.D
I thought you loved me, bitch, you tried to kill me, I'm getting off you
Quit callin' for me, hard proof's how I respond to
The Ambien and Tylenols too
Fuck all you

[Outro]
Fuckin' bitch
We're done

[Intro: Alfred Hitchcock]
I trust that everyone is enjoying the music
As the title of the album suggests
This was meant for your listening pleasure
While you are being done in

[Verse 1]
Call this evil intent, like me in a limo (Yeah)
Like the shade in these windows
Smoke gray, ladies go mental
But no way they can see in though (Nah)
OJ blade is a pencil (Yeah)
Propane tank in my cranium
Code-name Titanium Temple
I almost swallowed my car
I call my Mercedes a Benzo
Bitch, I ball like a baby
Ball like J, but not Jay as in
Jay-Z, J as in Leno
'Cause I got a huge mansion
No, huge man chin, new Manson, loose cannon
Too scandalous, Sue Atkins
The kinda crazy you can’t fix
I'm still the one that your parents hate
I'm in your house eating carrot cake
While I sit there and wait and I marinate
I’m irritated, you 'bout to meet a scary fate
And come home to find yourself starin' straight into a fuckin' barrel like Sharon Tate
Dre's on concerto while I narrate
Yeah, you be on the straight and narrow like a fuckin' arrow shape
I be on a higher plane in aerospace
With so much leg-room and air space on this airplane
Unlike you 'cause you're on a flight too, but it’s a staircase

[Chorus]
Now, little engine go, finna vrin-vrin go
I’m losin' control
Heroin and blow, Marilyn Monroe
Overd-d-dose
Time to Ri-Rick Roll, up the en-endo
Like a win-window
Little engine gone, little engine gone

[Verse 2]
I am the top-selling, who cares?
Stop dwelling, then stop yelling
I’m not yelling, you're yelling
Smart-aleck, goddammit
Fuck is that? Stop hammering (Goddamn)
That's what it sounds like in my brain
Much as I fight to restrain
I have the right to remain violent
Any rhyme that I say can and will be used against you
Icicle veins, mics'll get slain
Like they were strangled with bicycle chains
You’re gonna have to come identify the remains
Wait, what?
I said my head is twisted like a bread tie (Yup)
Can't get a fuckin' word in edgewise (Shut up)
Success overnight like a red-eye (Bitch)
Dressed like a Jedi at a Best Buy on the Westside
I'm hot, dawg
No, you're not, I'm the guy with the Oscar at Meijers
In appliances by the washers and dryers
Chick ran up like, "Marshall on fire"
I looked down and said, "No, I'm not, you're a liar"
She said, "No, your music
Heard you're back with the Doctor," then I heard

[Chorus]
Now, little engine go, finna vrin-vrin go
I'm losin' control
Heroin and blow, Marilyn Monroe
Overd-d-dose
Time to Ri-Rick Roll, up the en-endo
Like a win-window
Little engine gone, little engine gone (Dr. Dre)

[Bridge]
(Psycho) Psycho killer, (Michael) Michael, Thriller
(My flow) My flow apeshit, (I, I go) I go-rilla
(My flow) My flow still a (Psycho) psycho killer (Killer)
(Nitro) Hi ho, Silver
Similes and idioms giddy up

[Verse 3]
I think I can, I think I can
I know I can, psycho I am
Michael, my knife go right hand
In my left hand, I hold mic stand (Yeah)
Little engine gone (Yeah)
Chicka-ch-ch-chill, I got z-z-zero, zero, zip, zip, zilch (Yeah)
Like Kaepernick, I got kn-kn-kneel (Nil)
Word to Goodwill-will, this must be how bein' hood rich feels
Was a ghetto boy, now I ball out like Bushwick Bill (Hi-ho)
Finna take you out like an outro
Bruce Wayne and Alfred, look out, ho
Blueface meets Albert DeSalvo
Balboa with a scalpel
Scoundrel hound with a mouth full of Alpo, now go

[Chorus]
Little engine go, finna vrin-vrin go
I'm losin' control
Heroin and blow, Marilyn Monroe
Overd-d-dose
Time to Ri-Rick Roll, up the en-endo
Like a win-window
Little engine gone, little engine gone

[Interlude]
This concludes our danse macabre
Portions of the proceeding were recorded
As for the rest of it, I'm very much afraid it was all in your mind
I don't intend to indulge in any post-mortem
If you haven't been murdered, I can only say
Better luck next time
If you have been, goodnight wherever you are

[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah
So I guess this is what it is, huh?
Think it's obvious
We ain't never gonna see eye to eye
But it's funny
As much as I hate you
I need you
This is music to be murdered by

[Chorus: Nikki Grier]
Got a premonition
I feel the end is near
The beauty starts to fade
The joy has turned to pain
I hear the symphony playin'
Ten thousand violins
Souls floating away like feathers in the wind

[Verse: Eminem]
They said my last album I sounded bitter
No, I sound like a spitter
Who ninety percent of
These hypocrites are tryna get rid of
But why would I get a chip on my shoulder?
I was considered, one time, as the illest
Bitch, I'm still as fly as your zipper
True, I just get richer
But if it was ever all about skrilla
Then I woulda quit a long motherfucking time ago
Bitch, shut the fuck up
I should go say that shit to Tech N9ne or to Jigga
Nobody said shit about 2 Chainz as long as he's been here, shit
No wonder you're mad, now I'm
Looking at them plaques, count 'em (Yeah)
I'm LL Cool J, Bigger and Deffer, that's how come (Uh)
I sell like four mil' when I put out a bad album (What?)
Revival flopped, came back and I scared the crap out 'em
But Rolling Stone stars, I get two and a half outta
Five, and I'll laugh out loud
'Cause that's what they gave BAD back in the day
Which actually made me not feel as bad now, 'cause
If it happened to James
It can happen to Shady
They do the same shit to Brady
More people hate me than love me
This game will make you go crazy
'Bout to go for B-R-O-K-E
I was the G, the O-A-T
Once I was played in rotation
At every radio station
They said I'm lyrically amazing
But I have nothing to say
But then when I put out Revival and I had something to say
They said that they hated the awake me
I lose the rage, I'm too tame
I get it back, they say I'm too angry
I need to get me some Dre beats
No, I should hook up with Tay Keith
Fans keep on pulling me one way
Haters pull me in another
Got more hooks in me than Swae Lee
'Bout to pick up some weights and lift 'til my tattoo of Hailie's face stretches
They said I'm just a whiner, I sound like a baby
I dish it out but can't take it
But I take it, dish it back out
And they get all bent out of shape
This shit's almost comical
Wait, and I meant no disrespect
I wasn't dissin' Tech, that was not a shot at 2 Chainz or to Jay-Z
They probably feel the same way because lately
Instead of us being credited for longevity
And being able to keep it up for this long at this level, we
Get told we'll never be what we were
Bitch, if I was as half as good as I was
I'm still twice as good as you'll ever be
Only way that you're ahead of me's alphabetically
'Cause if you diss me I'm coming after you like the letter V
Killing everything, play this tune, it's your eulogy
It's your funeral, prepare to die
This is music for you to be murdered by

[Intro]
Ayo
(This a song about)
My, my stepdad
(Let's see if this ever happened to you)
I, I hate
My, my stepdad

[Verse 1]
One thing that sticks in my craw
When I was six and I saw my stepfather hittin' my Ma
Socked her right in her eyeball
I'm startin' to think I'm psychotic
With all the pictures I draw of
Shit that I've already witnessed, it’s probably twisted my thoughts
All I can hear is drama with Mom and him
I can always hear 'em arguin' down the hallways
The walls are thin so the noise is startin' to feel like the norm
Our dog pissed on the carpet, he stomped it so hard
Doctors had to put it down
He killed my chihuahua, this motherfucker!

[Chorus]
I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (Stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', "Bye-bye stepdad" (Stepdad)

[Verse 2]
Outside, I look like I'm calm
Inside, I'm a tickin' time bomb
'Cause of this motherfucker, who sticks his dick in my mom (My mom)
Last night, he said I left the kitchen light on
But he walked in there this morning and purposely flipped it, I saw him
Hickory switch to my bottom, I counted sixty-nine times
He swatted me with it, I'd cry
He just started hittin' me harder
God, I wish I could just jaw him
If I could get my weight up
But I'm just a second grader
This prick is bigger than I am
But I've been readin' at school about this shit called liquid cyanide
I'm fantasizin' at night when he's sleepin' at just the right time
Sneak up with a lethal injection
And put him down like they did to my dog
I'm talkin' euthanasia (Euthanasia), like kids in Taiwan
This fuckin' shit's like Saigon (Saigon)
Neighbors called police on him
So many battery charges, this dude's like lithium-ion
Then Mom and him let bygones (Bygones)
Just be bygones
So on eggshells, I walk and just try not to piss this guy off
But this is why I...

[Chorus]
I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (Stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', "Bye-bye stepdad" (Stepdad)

[Verse 3]
So this year, I'm goin' into the fifth and I'm tall
I'm five foot six on my block, I'm the toughest kid but I got
Way bigger fish to fry
Which is why I'm tryin' to get this bitch to fly off
The handle and wait for the fist to fly to put this guy in a pine box
He's always lookin' for chaos but tonight I've cooked up a plan
So this Christmas, I got some color books and some crayons
I'm layin' on the floor, in the living room with some friends colorin'
He walks by, kicks my arm and goes, "Oops" and just laughs
I yelled for Mom (Mom) and as she's rushin' to my defense
I stood up and said, "Fuck you, punk" and I took off and ran
To my bedroom, as I fled
Knowin' shit would hit the fan
Slammed the door and hid behind it with an aluminum bat
He kicked it in
I swung it hard as I could at his head
His noodle went splat, he fell right at the foot of my bed
I'm a little bit scared but my anger's overtooken the fear
I threw down the bat and just started whoopin' his ass
Beat him with my bare hands, the big bad wolf ain't so bad
"Ding-dong," the pussy is dead, the bully finally gets his
Stomped him until he pissed enough to fill a two-liter with
Then buried him next to my dog
And if I go to juvie for this, I'ma tell 'em

[Chorus]
I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (Stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', "Bye-bye stepdad" (Stepdad)
'Cause I, I, hate
My, my stepdad (Stepdad)
So tonight I'm sayin', "Bye-bye stepdad" (Stepdad)

[?] yeah, whoa-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Um, yeah, yeah
Back when I used to wake up first thing
Lookin' for a text sayin', "Hello, baby"
And when I didn't see shit
Wasn't no secret, that used to drive me crazy
I hit you on some freak shit, on some flirt shit
On some, "What you doin' after work?" shit
"Can I take you out to dinner and dessert 'til it hurt?"
I'ma merk shit, I'ma merk shit, I'ma merk shit
My God, you drop
My jaw to the floor, fall apart
My squad, know all about you
I'ma let you lay down all the ground rules (Ground rules)
I'ma break, I'ma sign the cast
Numb all the pain that the mind relax
We could fuck through the day
'Til we tired and passed out
It's good when the time is passed down

[Chorus]
When you feelin' all alone
Dial that number, call my phone
You can do your job from home
It ain't a race, okay
We can waste today
Ground rules, ground rules, ground rules, ground rules

[Verse 2]
Keep me up night and day
Somethin' to numb my pain
Glow like the light in space
Hurry up, girl, ándale
Let's get this on the way
Put it on my tongue, just taste
Think I'm gon' run away?
Baby, ain't no fuckin' way

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
When you feelin' all alone
Dial that number, call my phone
You can do your job from home
It ain't a race, okay
We can waste today
Ground rules, ground rules, ground rules, ground rules

[Intro]
Ice, ice, baby

Girl, my wrist so frozen, might stunt on your boyfriend
See me in that foreign, girl, you know that boy borin'

Lyrics from snippet

[Verse 1]
Tell me lies, tell me lies, that's all you ever do
Tell me what I wanna hear, make me feel comfortable
For the night, we could ride and give me all of you
Just for the night, do it right just how I want you to

[Chorus]
You got it, you got it, girl, do what you gotta do
Say what you want, since you know how to make me come to you
You got it, you got it, girl, do what you got to
Say what you want, since I'm numb, just give me all of you
You got it, you got it, girl
When you walk through the door, tell me all that you want out of my love
You got it, you got it, girl

[Verse 1]
I can't read and I can't write down
I don't know a book from countdown
I don't know what shadow gets me
All I've got is someone's face

[Verse 2]
Can I see the family smile?
Can  I reach tomorrow?
Can I walk a missing mile?
Can I feel?
Can I please?

[Chorus]
I can't reach it anymore
I just sit back and ignore
I just can't  seem to get it right
I can't reach it, I can't reach it

[Verse 3]
Money goes to money heaven
Bodies go to body hell
I sit back and catch the chase
Switch the channel, watch the police cars

[Chorus]
I can't reach it anymore
I just sit back and ignore
I just can't seem to get it right, get it right
I can't reach it, I can't reach it

[Verse 1]
We passed upon the stair
We spoke of was and when
Although I was not there
He said I was his friend
Which came as some surprise
I spoke into his eyes, "I thought you died alone
A long long time ago"

[Chorus]
Oh no, not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

[Verse 2]
I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched for form and land
For years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazeless stare
At all the millions here
We must have died alone
A long long time ago

[Chorus]
Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

[Chorus]
Oh no, not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

[Non-Lyrical Outro]

[Verse 1: David Bowie]
Like to take a cement fix
Be a standing cinema
Dress my friends up just for show
See them as they really are
Put a peephole in my brain
Two New Pence to have a go
I'd like to be a gallery
Put you all inside my show

[Chorus: David Bowie & Gail Ann Dorsey]
Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen
Can't tell them apart at all, no

[Verse 2: David Bowie]
Andy walking, Andy tired
Andy take a little snooze
Tie him up when he's fast asleep
Send him on a pleasant cruise
When he wakes up on the sea
Be sure to think of me and you
He'll think about paint
And he'll think about glue
What a jolly boring thing to do

[Chorus: David Bowie & Gail Ann Dorsey]
Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen
Can't tell them apart at all
Andy Warhol looks a scream
Hang him on my wall
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen
Can't tell them apart at all

[Verse 1]
When all the world was very young
Mountain magic heavy hung
The supermen would walk in file
Guardians of a loveless isle
And gloomy browed with super fear
Their tragic endless lives
Would heave nor sigh
Solemn  serenity
Wondrous beings chained to life

[Chorus]
Strange games they would play then
No death for the perfect men
Life rolls into one for them
So softly, a super god cries

[Verse 2]
Where all were minds in uni-thought
Power's weird by mystics taught
No pain, no joy, no power too great
Colossal strength to grasp a fate
Sad-eyed mermen tossed in slumbers
Nightmare dreams
No mortal mind could hold
Man would tear his brother's flesh
A chance to die, to turn to mold

[Chorus]
Far out in the red-sky then
Far out from the sad eyes then
Strange, mad celebrations
So softly, a super god cries!
Far out in the red-sky
Far out from the sad eyes then
Strange, mad celebrations
So softly, a super god cries

[Verse 1]
Well, Johnny is a man
And he's bigger than you
But his overheads are high
And he looks straight through you w
When you ask him how the kids are

[Verse 2]
He'll get home around seven
'Cause the Chevy’s real old
And he could have had a Cadillac
If the school had taught him right

[Refrain]
And he could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
He could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse

[Verse 3]
And the food is on the table
But the food is cold
(Don't hit her)
Can't you even cook?
What's the good of me working when you can't damn cook?

[Verse 4]
Well, Johnny is a man and he's bigger than her
I guess the bruises won't show
If she wears long sleeves
But the space in her eyes shows through

[Refrain]
And he could have married Anne with the blue silk blouse
Could've married Anne with the blue silk blouse
Could've married Anne with the blue silk blouse
Could've married Anne with the blue silk blouse

[Outro]
It shows through
It shows through
It shows through
Could've married Anne with the blue silk blouse
Could've married Anne with the blue silk blouse
Could've married Anne with the blue silk blouse
That shows through

[Intro]
Dah-dah-dah-dah da da da
Dah-dah-dah-dah, dah-dah-dah-dah
Dah-dah-dah-dah da da da
Dah-dah-dah-dah, dah-dah-dah-dah

[Verse 1]
People stared at the makeup on his face
Laughed at his long black hair
His animal grace
The boy in the bright blue jeans
Jumped up on the stage
And Lady Stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and disgrace

[Chorus]
And he was alright
The band was all together
Yes he was alright
The song went on forever
And he was awful nice
Really quite out of sight
And he sang all night long

[Verse 2]
Femme Fatales emerged to watch this creature fair
Boys stood upon their chairs
To make their point of view
I smiled sadly for a love I could not obey
Lady Stardust sang his songs
Of darkness and dismay

[Chorus]
And he was alright
The band was all together
Yes he was alright
The song went on forever
And he was awful nice
Really quite out of sight
He sang all night long

[Bridge]
Oh, have I sighed
When they asked if I knew his name

[Chorus]
Oh, he was alright
The band was altogether
Yes, he was alright
The song went on forever
Yes he was awful nice
Really quite paradise
He sang all night long
Yes, he did
Dah-dah-dah-dah, dah-dah-dah-dah
Oh la la la la la la
Dah-dah-dah-dah, dah-dah-dah-dah

[Verse 1]
Dead ring ash of extreme defense
The lonely groups of company boys
Snapping pics of scrawny limbs and toothy grins
These are children riding naked on their tourist pals
While the hollows that pass for eyes swell from withdrawal
As he lies on a mattress in a rat-infested room
Talking 'bout his family and the cold back home

[Chorus]
Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
No one over here reads the papers, pal
Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
He's a clean trick and he's shopping for girls

[Verse 2]
A small black someone jumps over the crazy white guard
Cranking up the volume on a Michael Jackson song

[Chorus]
Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
No one over here reads the papers, pal
Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
He's a clean trick and he's shopping for girls

[Verse 3]
Where the frangipani scents the air
She mouths a word that breaks his stare
He grunts his reply in a garrulous croak
"That's a mighty big word for a nine year old"

[Chorus]
Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
No one over here reads the papers, pal
Between the dull cold eyes and the mind unstable
He's a clean trick and he's shopping for girls

[Outro]
He's a clean trick and he's shopping for girls
You gaze down into her eyes for a million miles
You wanna give her a name and a clean rag doll

[Verse 1]
I'm closer to the golden dawn
Immersed in Crowley's uniform
Of imagery

[Verse 2]
I'm living in a silent film
Portraying Himmler's sacred realm
Of dream reality

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm frightened by the total goal
I'm drawing to the ragged hole
And I ain't got the power anymore
No, I ain't got the power anymore

[Verse 3]
I'm the twisted name on Garbo's eyes
Living proof of Churchill's lies
I'm destiny

[Verse 4]
I'm torn between the light and dark
Where others see their targets
Divine symmetry

[Pre-Chorus]
Should I kiss the viper's fang
Or herald loud the death of man
I'm sinking in the quicksand
Of my thought
And I ain't got the power anymore

[Chorus]
Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with death's release
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah; ah

[Verse 5]
I'm not a prophet or a stone-age man
Just a mortal with potential of a superman
I'm living on

[Verse 6]
I'm tethered to the logic of homo sapien
Can't take my eyes from the great salvation
Of bullshit faith

[Pre-Chorus]
If I don't explain what you ought to know
You can tell me all about it
On the next Bardo
I'm sinking in the quicksand
Of my thought
And I ain't got the power anymore

[Chorus]
Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with death's release
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah; ah

[Chorus]
Don't believe in yourself
Don't deceive with belief
Knowledge comes with death's release
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah; ah

[Verse 1: David Bowie, Gail Ann Dorsey, Both]
Watching him dash away
Swinging an old bouquet
Dead roses
Sake and strange divine
Uh-huh-huh-uh, huh-uh
You'll make it
Passionate bright young things
Takes him away to war
Don't fake it
Saddening glissando strings
Uh-huh-huh-uh, huh-uh
You'll make it

[Chorus: David Bowie and Gail Ann Dorsey]
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Battle cries and champagne
Just in time for sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?

[Verse 2: Gail Ann Dorsey and David Bowie]
Motor sensational
Paris or maybe hell
I'm waiting
Clutches of sad remains
Waits for Aladdin Sane
You'll make it

[Chorus: Gail Ann Dorsey and David Bowie]
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Millions weep a fountain
Just in case of sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane
Love Aladdin Sane

[Chorus: Gail Ann Dorsey and David Bowie]
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Millions weep a fountain
Just in case of sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane
Will love Aladdin Sane

[Outro: Gail Ann Dorsey and David Bowie]
Insane
Insane
Who will love Aladdin Sane
Will love Aladdin Sane

Take facetime, wanna stay patient
What they gonna do, huh, stay ace huh?

Ooh-ah

[Verse 1]
Gorgeous girls are bound to meet
To talk of stars and kings and feet
Through the chromosomes of space and time
Me I'm fast like bad infection
Gasping for my resurrection
Swear to me in times of war and stress

[Pre-Chorus]
Telling lies
Ooh-ah

Telling lies

[Verse 2]
Shadow falls in shrinking smiles
See me poised at the happy games
Standing in the mouth of all that's pure
Come straggling in your tattered remnants
You come to me with tears and blame
I'm your future, I am tomorrow, I am the end

[Pre-Chorus]
Telling lies

[Intro: Meek Mill]
Yeah, woo

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
We was in the trenches, tryna get it out the mud
Lookin' up to killers, tryna figure who I was
Sold the Richard Porter, I just want to feel the love
I feel like a Crip 'cause I can't even trust my blood
Loyalty, (You know what loyalty is?), I say, "Spoil me"
You ain't my dawg, you fallin' out of about no lawyer fee (No lawyer fee)
You had a brick and I ain't even have a quarter key
You never seen my hand out, I knew it was more to me
It's more than us to see our sons and all our daughters eat
'Cause I got cops tryna lock me, opps out tryna slaughter me
But I stay prayed up, loadin' all these K's up
'Cause I ain't get advice from all them nights back when I stayed up
Don't hit me about no show if you ain't came to set the stage up
We God body, threw a thousand shots, they barely grazed us
And I can't let 'em make my grave up

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
I just hope this money take the pain away
And I've been tryna save my money for a rainy day
But I just bought that Rolls truck to take the pain away
And all these diamonds give me confidence
Don't judge my pain if you don't know this shit that I'm against

[Verse 2: Roddy Ricch]
Hey, it's free my dawg, free my dawg, they gave him a thousand years
We went from public houses to standin' on the private lear
Richest nigga in my section, I'm a project pioneer
Flow through at midnight and pray to God, I ain't dyin' here
I bought some new choppers and laced my nigga with some riot gear
They want war with us, these niggas gon' hate me regardless 'cause I'm from Park Village
Trap it out and make a hunnid thousand out of apartments, nigga
Introduce shawty to a young boss, she ain't met nothin' realer
I grew up with all the monsters, robbers, and gorillas
Had some wins and took some losses, fans was takin' pictures
Niggas tried to take us out but we gon' take 'em with us
Gotta hold on that glizzy tight, these niggas ain't really right
I'm feelin' like Superman, they ain't takin' the Kryptonite
Tryna take my blue faces, had to up on the red bean
Gotta feed my niggas, when I ain't have it they fed me

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
I just hope this money take the pain away
And I've been tryna save my money for a rainy day
But I just bought the Rolls truck to take the pain away
And all these diamonds give me confidence
Don't judge my pain if you don't know this shit that I'm against

[Verse 3: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I can't sleep, I got insomnia
I'm hearin' demons, talkin' to me, tryna sign me up
They eatin' cheese, they told police about a lot of stuff
We ain't hidin' but they talkin' about findin' us
They ain't even got no guns and they throwin' shots at us
My homies homie tryna get my homie to lock me up
The crazy part about life, you don't know when your time is up
Stay on point if I pop off, I know my guys gon' follow up
Have you ever seen a body inside of a garbage truck
It's too late for fake apologies, too late to chop it up
I know love is temporary, I know I'ma 

[?]
Love is temporary, one day they miss you, then get tired of us
When I'm in this room 

[?] I'ma hit you and you tryna fuck
'Cause I'll fuck you right I will
I'll fuck you right I will
I'll fuck you right I will
I'll fuck like you want a Birkin bag

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
I just hope this money take the pain away
And I've been tryna save my money for a rainy day
But I just bought the Rolls truck to take the pain away
And all these diamonds give me confidence
Don't judge my pain if you don't know this shit that I'm against

[Verse 1]
Living in lies by the railway line
Pushing the hair from my eyes
Elvis is English and climbs the hills
Can't tell the bullshit from the lies
Screaming along in South London
Vicious but ready to learn
Sometimes I fear that the whole world is queer
Sometimes but always in vain

[Chorus]
So I'll wait until we're sane
Wait until we're blessed and all the same
Full of blood, loving life and all it's got to give
Englishmen going insane

[Refrain]
Down on my knees in Suburbia
Down on myself in every way

[Verse 2]
With great expectations I change all my clothes
Mustn't grumble at silver and gold
Screaming above Central London
Never bored, so I'll never get old

[Chorus]
So I'll wait until we're sane
Wait until we're blessed and all the same
Full of blood, loving life and all it's got to give
Englishmen going insane

[Refrain]
Down on my knees in suburbia
Down on myself in every way

[Outro]
Day after, day after day, day after
Zane, Zane, Zane, Ouvre le chien
Day after day, day after
Zane, Zane, Zane, Ouvre le chien
Day after

[Intro]
You
You
You
You
You
You

[Verse 1]
All our friends
Now seem so thin and frail
Slinky secrets
Hotter than the sun
No peachy fréres
No trendy réchauffé
I'm with you
So I can't go on

[Chorus]
All my violence raining tears upon the sheets
I'm bewildered, for we're strangers when we meet

[Verse 2]
Blank screen TV
Preening ourselves in the snow
Forget my name
But I'm over you
Blended sunrise
And it's a dying world
Humming Rheingold
We scavenge up our clothes

[Chorus]
All my violence raining tears upon the sheets
I'm resentful, for we're strangers when we meet

[Verse 3]
Cold tired fingers
Tapping out your memories
Halfway sadness
Dazzled by the new
Your embrace
It was all that I feared
That whirling room
We trade by vendu

[Chorus]
Steely resolve is falling from me
My poor soul, poor bruised passivity
All your regrets ride rough-shod over me
I'm so glad that we're strangers when we meet
I'm so thankful, that we're strangers when we meet
I'm in clover, for we're strangers when we meet
Heel head over, when we're strangers when we meet

[Outro]
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet
Strangers when we meet

[Verse 1]
I was missing the guys (I was missing the guys)
In my rented apartment
You would think I'd have realised
But I didn't for quite sometime
Started wetting my eyes (Started wetting my eyes)
'Cause I'm soft in that department
Right then I realised
You're the love of my life

[Chorus]
The moment that you took my hand
Was the best thing that ever happened, yeah
The moment that we started a band
Was the best thing that ever happened
And I wish that we could do it again
It was the best thing that ever happened to me
It was the best thing that ever happened to me
It was the best thing that ever happened

[Verse 2]
I took a zoot outside
In my coat's secret compartment
I hear a song and start to cry
Pretend it's smoke that's in my eye
I don't know why I'm surprised
'Cause we all shared one apartment
Man, they were the golden times
They were the best of my life

[Chorus]
The moment that you took my hand (The moment that you took my hand)
Was the best thing that ever happened, yeah
The moment that we started a band (The moment that we started a band)
Was the best thing that ever happened
Oh, the first time we went to Japan (The first time we went to Japan)
Was the best thing that ever happened (The best thing)
And I wish that we could do it again
You guys are the best thing that ever happened to me
You guys are the best thing that ever happened to me
You guys are the best thing that ever happened
You guys are the best thing that ever happened to me
You guys are the best thing that ever happened

If you're on a mission (Uh-huh)
You got my permission (Oh)

We can get down like there's no one around

[Verse 1]
I took this walk to ease my mind
To find out what's gnawing at me
And wouldn't think to look at me
That I've spent a lot of time in education
All seems so long ago
I'm a thinker, not a talker
I've no-one to talk to, anyway

[Refrain]
I can't see the road
For the rain in my eyes

[Verse 2]
I live above the grocer's store
Owned by an Austrian
He often calls me down to eat
And he jokes about his broken English
Tries to be a friend to me
But for all my years of reading conversation
I stand without a word to say

[Refrain]
I can't see the bridge
For the rain in my eyes

[Bridge]
And the world is full of life
Full of folk who don't know me
And they walk in twos or threes or more

[Verse 3]
While the light that shines above the grocer's store
Investigates my face so rudely
And my essays lying scattered on the floor
Fulfill their needs just by being there
And my hands shake, my head hurts
My voice sticks inside my throat
I'm invisible and dumb and no one will recall me

[Refrain]
And I can't see the water
Through the tears in my eyes

[Verse 1]
We only have the weekend
You can serve it to me, ancient-city style
We can party like it's B.C.
With a pretty sixteenth-century smile

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the thing that you bring
That you bring, that you bring
Him, you and me
That's gossip

[Chorus]
Strut it out, walk a mile
Serve it, ancient-city style
Talk it out, babble on
Battle for your life, Babylon
That's gossip, what you on?
Money don't talk, rip that song
Gossip, babble on
Battle for your life, Babylon

[Post-Chorus]
Ba-Ba-Babylon
Gossip, gossip
Ba-Ba-Babylon (Battle for your life)
Gossip, gossip
Ba-Ba-Babylon
Gossip, gossip
Ba-Ba-Babylon

[Verse 2]
Bodies moving like a sculpture (Ooh)
On the top of Tower of Babel tonight
We are climbing up to Heaven (Heaven)
Speak in languages in a BloodPop® moonlight

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the thing that you bring
That you bring, that you bring
Him, you, and me
That's gossip (That's gossip)

[Chorus]
Strut it out, walk a mile
Serve it, ancient-city style
Talk it out, babble on
Battle for your life, Babylon
That's gossip, what you on?
Money don't talk, rip that song
Gossip, babble on
Battle for your life, Babylon

[Post-Chorus]
Ba-Ba-Babylon

That's gossip, what you on?
Money don't talk, rip that song
Gossip, babble on
Battle for your life, Babylon

[Verse 1]
It keeps me awake, the look on your face
The moment you heard the news
You're screaming inside and frozen in time
You did all that you could do
The game was rigged, the ref got tricked
The wrong ones think they’re right
You were outnumbered this time

[Chorus]
But only the young, only the young
Only the young, only the young
Can run
Can run
So run, and run, and run

[Verse 2]
So every day now
You brace for the sound you've only heard on TV
You go to class, scared
Wondering where the best hiding spot would be
And the big bad man and his big bad clan
Their hands are stained with red
Oh, how quickly they forget

[Pre-Chorus]
They aren't gonna help us
Too busy helping themselves
They aren't gonna change this
We gotta do it ourselves
They think that it's over
But it's just begun

[Chorus]
Only one thing can save us
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young
Only the young (Only the young; Don't say you're too tired to fight)
Only the young (Only the young; It's just a matter of time)
Only the young (Only the young; Up there's the finish line)
Only the young
Can run

[Post-Chorus]
Don't say you're too tired to fight
It's just a matter of time (Can run)
Up there's the finish line (So run, and run, and run)
Don't say you're too tired to fight
It's just a matter of time (So run)
Up there's the finish line (And run, and run, and run)

[Outro]
Only the young
Only the young
Only the young
Lyrics from snippet

[Verse 1]
...automatic drapes, yeah
She on the twelfth one, so late, yeah
Pass out diamonds up the 

[?] to the 

[?]
I'm your Superman in the drop top with no cape, yeah
I was livin' in LA before Bape, yeah (Wheezy outta here)

[Chorus]
I got red diamonds like your neck bleedin'
I got baby Rollies on my kiddies
I got training wheels just for notice
Yeah, bowlegged Bentley with the two T's
Put the rental dragon where 

[?]
I told the bitch to call me tall please
Got a Moncler coat on and it's bubbly
Wheezy wave, ooh, tsunami

[Verse 2]
I just got you the new autobiography
Yellow brake pad, ooh, with the yellow seats
Girl, I tell you, woo-hoo, you better not cheat on me
Everything I bought you, ooh, why you cheat on me?
I just bought the bitch Chanel, why you cheat on me?
You got all the Gucci, girl, why you cheat on me?
All a nigga do is fear, you gotta believe me
Cannot trust you if you ain't a virgin
Check your luggage while you're traveling with a Trojan
Check your luggage while you're traveling with...

[Verse 1]
What if there was no light?
Nothing wrong, nothing right?
What if there was no time?
And no reason or rhyme?
What if you should decide
That you don't want me there by your side?
That you don't want me there in your life?

[Verse 2]
What if I got it wrong?
And no poem or song
Could put right what I got wrong
Or make you feel I belong
What if you should decide
That you don't want me there by your side?
That you don't want me there in your life?

[Hook]
Oooooh, that's right
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
Oooooh, that's right
How can you know it if you don't even try?
Oooooh, that's right

[Verse 3]
Every step that you take
Could be your biggest mistake
It could bend or it could break
But that's the risk that you take
What if you should decide
That you don't want me there in your life?
That you don't want me there by your side?

[Hook]
Oooooh, that's right
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
Oooooh, that's right
How can you know it when you don't even try?
Oooooh, that's right

[Outro]
Oh, Oooooh, that's right
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
Oooooh, that's right
You know that darkness always turns into light
Oooooh, that's right

[Intro]
Uh

[Verse 1]
Back when the music was the singles
'Fore the rap niggas started making jingles
Back when Soulja made a killing off of ringtones
Back then, I would stack my chips, Pringles
Back then, young kid sicker than the measles
Kept the dope fiends itchin' like it's ringworms
Baskin', married to the game without a ring, though
You was precious to me, I was Smeegle, goddamn
Fast forward, you was everything, I was livin' for
Only thing soft was your chest, I was restin' on
Through them rough nights, love is what I did it for
Did you wrong, back then I couldn't do nothin' right, goddamn
I'll admit it, you the reason that I'm in it
Be the reason you be queefin' while I'm in it long
Take a minute, 'cause you're grievin' hard (Huh, huh)
When the liquor bleedin' through your pores
Sleepin' on the floors, damn it, Jim Morrison doors
Starin' at the ceilings and the posters on the walls
So outgoing but we was indoors
Don't know what we in for, ten fold

[Chorus]
You should have been my missus
I done struck out, yeah, I know I missed it
This one dedicated to my bitches
All the real ones who will never get the mention
This song, I done struck out, yeah, I know I missed it
This one dedicated to my bitches
All the real ones who will never get the mention
This song dedicated to you, for you
This song (This song)
For you (For you)
Oh, whoa, whoa
Oh, whoa, whoa

[Verse 2]
Back when the music was the singles (Singles)
'Fore my baby brother rapped like the mingles
Like when white folks wouldn't even mingle
I'm just glad, we just speak the same lingo, goddamn
All I want is guap and my Evisu
And the bad ho from Santo Domingo
I ain't had a fan or birdie to sing to
Now I'm realizin' how much I need you
Turf's gon' help me get wealthy
The turf's gon' bless me, Hail Mary
I done had menages, bunch of RiRi look alikes
And wannabe Beyoncé's, playin' mind games
They was in between my cock and my mom's place
Between a rock and a hard place

[Chorus]
You should have been my missus
I done struck out, yeah, I know I missed it
This one dedicated to my bitches
All the real ones who will never get the mention
This song, I done struck out, yeah, I know I missed it
This one dedicated to my bitches
All the real ones who will never get the mention
This song (This song)
For you (For you)
This song (This song)
For you (For you)

[Chorus]
'Bout twelve bad hoes in my section like Vegas
A few of 'em strangers, a few of 'em famous
When that ain't enough and black ain't enough
Man, I'm done actin' up, let's hit the crib and get faded
When you don't drink champagne but you orderin' cases
All your friends hangin' 'cause they know that you payin'
When them bills backin' up and black ain't enough
And them checks addin' up, you just don't wanna be famous

[Verse 1]
Got a mink doormat that say, "Nigga, we made it"
Got all white neighbors and most of 'em racist
They put your name and faces when you goin' in places
Then black ain't enough, you just don't wanna be famous
Real talk, real rap, look, I can't deny shit
Couldn't afford shit, but always was attracted to fly shit
Guess that's why I buy, won't invest or capitalize
But expectin' to die rich, just a rich nigga mindset
That's why I'm packin' up my shit, like I'm back at the mom's crib
Like I'm back on my grind like, it's a nine-to-five shift
'Cause nothin' was handed to me, uh, go in and hand it to me
Like I'm Puffy in '96, (Gimme the loot, gimme the loot)
Let's hope that she really for me, most hoes couldn't handle me
I'm postponin' a family, work hard so they know what I stand for
Just have 'em to Grammy me? Damn, have 'em Grammy me?
Damn, just don't wanna be famous

[Chorus]
'Bout twelve bad hoes in my section like Vegas
A few of 'em strangers, a few of 'em famous
When that ain't enough and black ain't enough
Man, I'm done actin' up, let's hit the crib and get faded
When you don't drink champagne but you orderin' cases
Your friends like hangin' 'cause they know that you payin'
When them bills backin' up and black ain't enough
And them checks addin' up, you just don't wanna be famous

[Verse 2]
Uh, look at me, get what you see, envision me
Braids and chains, is he Pusha T or Mr. T?
No Hookah smoke, no niggas please, no liquor please
A different me, I'm in this bitch and I'm sippin' tea
Uh, but never spill the tea, most of you niggas sick of me
What would she do to get to me? Get off the tip of the dick of me, please
Another victory, be flawless like the skin on me, please
Don't compare him and me, you offendin' me
This ain't a diss and we ain't enemies
They concerned with breakin' hits, I'm more concerned with makin' history
Loudest nigga in the room the weakest
Them quiet dudes just probably need better speakers
This ain't a modest way of livin', I ain't hungry
Just did a demolition to my kitchen, it was ugly
Cash rules everything around me, get the money, funny
How they got 20/20 vision but don't see a nigga vision 'til 2020?
(Wow) Uh

[Chorus]
'Bout twelve bad hoes in my section like Vegas
A few of 'em strangers, a few of 'em famous
When that ain't enough and black ain't enough
Man, I'm done actin' up, let's hit the crib and get faded
When you don't drink champagne but you orderin' cases
Your friends like hangin' 'cause they know that you payin'
When them bills backin' up and black ain't enough
And them checks addin' up, you just don't wanna be famous

Woo, this some bullshit
Yeah

Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse: Gunna]
I left out Atlanta then moved to Miami 'cause I heard the weather was better (Uh)
I pulled out the hood and moved right in a mansion and we doing better than ever
I got my nigga that new Presidential, we constantly spending the cheddar
The hate got me poppin’, I shit on these niggas I prolly wouldn't even remember (Even remember, okay)
Giving some racks to my ex bitch, she stay looking better
Oh, loyalty, word to Moncler, yeah, regional member
Yeah, that's my dog though
We was just starving, that shit hard, and now we can ball together

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
When a nigga lash out, wanna label me a thug
Well I'ma show you what it feel like
A nigga had to share a cloak and bath soap
My first time whippin' crack, I ain't get it right
I just hit twenty-seven, heard them legends die young
I don't fuck with needles or crack pipes
But I put that on my kid, I'ma die for my young
Hopefully she'll get the steps right
Remember wakin' up at county
My attorney got whole list of assaults
Half are plea bargains, other half I paid off
And all the crimes I committed, I see the judge read it off
And all the police be crooked, and you can't judge me at all
Ha, yeah
I see the nigga I wanna be in the mirror
And I didn't love myself like I do now
Ooh yeah, they hate a nigga that's fearless
Ha, they hate the freedom, yeah, they hate a nigga lifestyle

[Chorus: Sevyn Streeter & Chris Brown]
Oh-oh (Oh-oh)
Sick and tired of always bein' fed up
You know diamonds only form from pressure
You're expectin' me to run for cover
But it's bombs away tonight
Dance with the Devil, I'm playin' with fire
Nothin' gon' change, nothin' gon' save me
I'm playin' with fire
Ain't no breakin' these chains so why am I prayin'?
I'm playin' with fire
All on my own, sittin' here cryin' for someone to take me
I got no hands on the wheel
Drivin' while I'm intoxicated (Ayy)

[Verse 2: Kap G]
Yeah, I just wanna brand new Royce, yeah (Skrrt)
I just wanna brand new Porsche, yeah (New Porsche)
I just want a Lambo' with the horse, yeah (With the horse)
I just wanna dress you up you in Dior, yeah (In Dior)
I remember when I was poor, yeah (When I was poor)
Now I'm on my way to the Forbes, yeah (To the Forbes)
I don't really like to import, yeah (Import)
Disappointers'll be with me with the fork, yeah
Skrrt, skrrt
My brother, they whippin'
No, I want the Bentley truck (Ooh)
Can't put a semi up
For Magic City up
Sleep with the semi up (Gang!)
They don't fuck with me
I'm fuckin' the city up (Ooh)
Ramen noodles, rockin' food now
I'm doin' shows up in Honolulu
I posted in the cut just like a boo-boo
My bitch from New Orleans but she don't do voodoo

[Chorus: Sevyn Streeter]
Oh-oh (Oh-oh)
Sick and tired of always bein' fed up
You know diamonds only form from pressure
You're expectin' me to run for cover
But it's bombs away tonight
Dance with the Devil, I'm playin' with fire

[Chorus]
I'm still Wiz (Still Wiz)
Niggas got me in that mood (In that mood)
How they hatin' when they know that I'm that dude? (I'm that dude)
I hear they hatin' 'cause they know I got the juice (Got the juice), uh-huh (Yeah)
They like ooh, they watchin' how I move (How I move)
Motherfuckers, they be actin' like we cool (Like we cool)
Fuck you thought this was? Nigga, I ain't no fool (Uh-uh, hahaha, uh)

[Verse 1]
Gas in my joint, what you smokin' don't flatter me
My niggas got my back, ain't no need for a battery
Blowin' all these ones, look like we hit the lottery
My OG just hit me up, he told me that he proud of me
Always goin' hard, a lot of people that count on me
Always in the studio and that's increasin' my salary
I remember I was young when they hated and doubted me
Now a nigga bossed up with my name on the property
And no, we don't care what it cost
I start it, you hear the exhaust
Smokin' kushy with my dawgs
The way she made it clap, she got it lookin' like applause
I'm gettin' all these plaques, ain't got enough space on my wall
Diamonds drippin' like a faucet

[Pre-Chorus]
Big bag, I want a big bag
If it ain't gettin' money, you can skip that (Skip that)
Big bag, I want a big bag
Put you in a two-seater, let you kick back

They like ooh, they watchin' how I move (How I move)
Motherfuckers, they be actin' like we cool (Like we cool)
Fuck you thought this was? Nigga, I ain't no fool (Uh-uh, hahaha)

[Verse 2]
Still keep it real, still park the whip and chill
Still never poppin' pills, still got 'em in they feels
Still give 'em chills, peel hundred dollar bills
Had a crib in the hills, one trip, couple mil'
How a nigga fall asleep and still makin' sales?
One hand on the wheel, couple bands on the meal
Playin' on the field, weigh it on a scale
In the air for twenty hours, I was unavailable
Seen how much I'm worth, started thinkin' I was dateable
All my niggas gettin' rich, dues, I done paid a few
Smokin' weed by the zip, millions, I done made a few
State to state, I'm stackin' up and stayin' out the way

[Pre-Chorus]
Big bag, I want a big bag
If it ain't gettin' money, you can skip that (Skip that)
Big bag, I want a big bag
Put you in a Rolls-Royce, let you kick back

I'm still Wiz (Still Wiz)
Niggas got me in that mood (In that mood)
How they hatin' when they know that I'm that dude? (I'm that dude)

Here we are, 20 something years old
Walkin' down on the marble stone road
I see your face, unafraid of where we go
Said, I, I
Baby, I'm not prepared to see the end of it
Love me long and I promise to end this with you, ooh-woah
And only with you-ooh, woah
Here we are, 'bout to settle down
Came a long way from single town
And we're unafraid of what the world thinks about us, yeah

[Chorus]
So let's get married young, I know that
God will guide our souls long after
Time has tickin' up, it's tickin' for you, ooh-ooh

Stayin' 10 toes down for you
Only for you, woah, woah

Just make love and never show fake love again
They safe love in night clubs to wake up (To wake up)
Ooo, ooo, ooo, yeah (Yeah)
And we are headed into the stars
And we are never looking back

[Verse]
She was a blur
Now she a blur in my memory
I remember what we was finna be
Now I know her as my enemy
'Member it was so friendly
But she just wanted some sympathy
I just wanted some empathy
I wasn't feelin' her energy
They ask about me in her interviews
I just want peace and tranquility
But now that hoe can go suck a dick
Yeah, Lewinsky no Hillary
So weird, 

[?] the enemy
I can tell she was gon' handle me
Tryna act so innocent
Now our love is so bittersweet
Now she just a blur in my memory
Not a little but literally
Can't read between lines, you illiterate
I hate her a lot, not a little bit
You befriended all my frenemies
You fuck with my ex, are you kidding me?
These hoes is best friends, are you shitting me
Hang out every day just to get to me
They fuck with me but don't fuck with me
The games that you play ain't offending me
I'ma just sip on my Hennessy
And now you a blur in my memory
Now you a start with a lemony
They spillin' out they tea, ain't no remedy
Tell your man I want smoke like a chimney
Now you gotta deal with the penalty
Damn

[Outro]
Ooo, ooo, ooo, yeah

[?] wake up tomorrow
No more waiting when we 

[?], don't follow
So much change over weeks of your horrors
Peel back the layers and then
We're finally free
And we are headed into the stars
And we are never looking back

[Verse]
We said that our love was just fun
The day that our friendship begun
Well theres no blue moon that I can see
Theres ever been in history

Because our love was just fun

[Verse]
We said that our love was just fun
The day that our friendship begun
Well theres no blue moon that I can see
Theres ever been in history

Because our love was just fun
Just Fun, Just Fun, Just Fun...

[Verse 1]
This week has passed me so slowly
The days fell on their knees
Maybe I'll take something to help me
Hope someone takes after me
There's always a change in the weather
This time I know we could get it together
If you would stay here tonight
That would be crazy tonight

[Chorus]
Stay
That's what I meant to say
Or do something, but what I never say is
Stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too

[Verse 2]
Heart-wrecker, heart-wrecker, save me tonight
Life can be vague when it sends someone new
This time tomorrow I'll know what to do
I know it's happened to you

[Chorus]
Stay
That's what I meant to say
Or do something, but what I never say is
Stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants so much to
Stay
That's what I meant to say
Or do something, but what I never say is
Stay this time
I really meant to so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too

[Interlude]
Stay
Stay

[Verse 1: Drake]
Cups of the rosé
Bitches in his old phone
He should call one and go home
He's been in this club too long
The woman that he would try
Is happy with a good guy
But he's been drinkin' so much
That he's gon' call her anyway, and say…

[Chorus: Drake]
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
He knows you still think about the times you had
He says fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, he knows he's not around

[Bridge: Drake & Ericka Lee]
(Is he drunk right now?)
He's just sayin' you could do better
Tell him, has he heard that lately?
He's just sayin' you could do better
And he'll start hatin' only if you make him

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, cups of the XO
All his people been here
He sees all of her friends here
Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning
What you doin' that's so important?
He's been drinkin' so much
That he's gon' call you anyway, and say…

[Chorus: Drake]
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
He knows you still think about the times you had
He says fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, he knows he's not around

[Bridge: Drake & Ericka Lee]
(Is he drunk right now?)
He's just sayin' you could do better
Tell him, has he heard that lately?
He's just sayin' you could do better
And he'll start hatin' only if you make him

[Verse 3: Drake]
He thinks he's addicted to naked pictures
And sitting talking 'bout bitches that they almost had
He don't think he's conscious of makin' monsters
Outta the women he sponsors 'til it all goes bad
But, shit, it's all good
They threw a party, yeah, they threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, they threw a party
He was just calling, ‘cause they were just leavin'
Talk to him, please,  he don't have much to believe in
He needs you right now, are you down to listen to him?
Too many drinks have been given to him
He's got some women that's livin' off him
He paid for their flights and hotels, he's ashamed
He bets that you know them, he won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same
He's had sex four times this week; He'll explain
He's havin' a hard time adjustin' to fame
Sprite in that mixture
He's been talkin' crazy, girl, he's lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
He needs someone to put his weight on
"Well, I'm sorry."

[Bridge: Drake & Ericka Lee]
(Is he drunk right now?)
He's just sayin' you could do better
Tell him, has he heard that lately?
He's just sayin' you could do better
And he'll start hatin' only if you make him

[Interlude: Drake]
You're not gonna come?
Guess he's 'bout to just kick it here then

[Outro: Drake]
Just throw up while he holds your hair back
Her white friend said, "You niggas crazy"
He hopes no one heard that
He hopes no one heard that
‘Cause if they did, they gonna be in some trouble
They gonna be in some trouble, trouble

[Intro: Charli XCX]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
When he calls me, I go crazy
Call me with my friends, it doesn't phase me
Windows down, ridin' in the SUV
And I'm spillin' champagne all on my screen, screamin'
Wheels are screechin', hundred miles per hour
He like me 'cause I'm wild, camera phone in the shower
Ring-ring, gonna let it ring out
Sounds so good, wanna turn it up loud

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I answer

[Verse 2: Sarah Bonito]
KKB, AAC
Your ringtone could be anything
A barking dog, revved engine
Whatever catches your attention
It's your choice
Would you like to hear my voice?
Or is it hard to talk
When you're scared of where the call is coming from?

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I answer

[Verse 3: Rico Nasty]
I think I might be addicted to your kisses
Lovestruck, baby, you're the piece I'm missin'
I know you're what I'm lookin' for and I'm so tired of wishin'
We can do it now or later, it don't make a difference
He sent me a text, says "See you when you get here"
I was lonely last week, but I won't be next year
Kiss me on my left cheek, love me like my bestie
On the phone with Ashley, run shit like an athlete
We be at the game, yeah, but we never play them
He could be in danger, I still wouldn't save him
I be in the front like Rudolph the Reindeer
I can tell you got a crush, that's the reason why you came here
You ain't gotta lie, just be honest with yourself
You wouldn't be here if it was for anyone else
My boy's got his own ringtone
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know
My boy's got his own ringtone
And when he calls me, I don't come home

[Bridge: Sarah Bonito]
Throw away my phone, hide it somewhere no one knows
Buried it in the ground, so it can never be found
But I still hear it, I hear the sound of your ringtone
It's a crime, why can't I get you outta my mind?

[Interlude: Laura Les]
My boy's got—
Wait, Charli, can you sing the chorus again please?

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
My boy's got his own ringtone (Oh, oh)
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know (Oh, oh)
My boy's got his own ringtone (Oh, oh)
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I know (Oh, oh)
My boy's got his own ringtone (Oh, oh)

My boy's got his own ringtone (Oh, oh)
It's the only one I know, it's the only one I— (Oh, oh)

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Keep playin' games I'll take her right away
I'll take her right away
I'll take her right away

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
50 you know I really don't like how you talk about my chick
I think you're just mad because she's not your bitch
Cause nobody fuck with your own, you're not rich
Man I shouldn't even have to tell you this shit
She can do bad all by her damn self (You know that)
When the bills come your ass just can't help
See the red on the bottom of her Christian Louboutins?
Match the Ferrari and that's why she gone (Vroom)
See I understand, am a man and you are sick
You should play the lotto and try to get rich quick (I wish ya luck)
She won't let your love turn into a bum
What the fuck you think she is, dumb?

[Chorus: Cee Lo Green]
I see you driving around town with the girl I love
And I'm like, "Fuck you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like: "Fuck you and fuck her, too"
Said if I was richer
I'd still be with ya
Hah, now ain't that some shit? (Ain't that some shit?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a fuck you (Oh, ooh, oooh)

[Verse 1: Cee Lo Green]
Yeah, I'm sorry, I can't afford a Ferrari
But that don't mean I can't get you there
I guess he's an Xbox and I'm more Atari
But the way you play your game ain't fair

[Pre-Chorus: Cee Lo Green]
I pity the fool that falls in love with you
(Oh shit, she's a gold digger)
Well.. (Just thought you should know, nigga)
(Ooh) I've got some news for you
("...Yeah, go run and tell your little boyfriend")

[Chorus: Cee Lo Green]
I see you driving around town with the girl I love
And I'm like, "Fuck you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like: "Fuck you and fuck her, too"
Said if I was richer
I'd still be with ya
Hah, now ain't that some shit? (Ain't that some shit?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a fuck you (Oh, ooh, oooh)

[Verse 2: Cee Lo Green]
Now I know that I had to borrow
Beg and steal and lie and cheat
Tryna keep ya, tryna please ya
'Cause being in love with your ass ain't cheap

[Pre-Chorus: Cee Lo Green]
I pity the fool, that falls in love with you
(Oh shit, she's a gold digger)
Well... (Just thought you should know, nigga)
(Ooh) I've got some news for you
("...Ooh, I really hate yo' ass right now")

[Chorus: Cee Lo Green]
I see you driving around town with the girl I love
And I'm like, "Fuck you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like: "Fuck you and fuck her, too"
Said if I was richer
I'd still be with ya
Hah, now ain't that some shit? (Ain't that some shit?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a fuck you (Oh, ooh, oooh)

[Bridge: Cee Lo Green]
Now baby, baby, baby, why d'you wanna, wanna hurt me so bad?
(So bad, so bad, so bad)
I tried to tell my momma, but she told me:
"This is one for your dad"
(Your dad, your dad, your dad)
Yes, she did, and I'm like
Uh! Why? Uh! Why? Uh! Why lady?!
Oh, I love you
Oh, I still love you, ooh

[Chorus: Cee Lo Green]
I see you driving around town with the girl I love
"Fuck you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like: "Fuck you and fuck her, too"
Said if I was richer
I'd still be with ya
Hah, now ain't that some shit? (Ain't that some shit?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a fuck you (Oh, ooh, oooh)

[Intro]
Welcome to the funeral, yeah
Closed casket as usual
Yeah, welcome to the funeral
The choir's singin' musicals
Kumbaya, it's beautiful
I bust in with that Uzi, though
And they look like they saw Lucifer
Rrr
Welcome to the funeral
We not welcome, we intruded, though
You wanted smoke until you blew the smoke
(Phew)
That's just unexcusable
Welcome to the funeral, where we from, we ruin them
We been to quite a few of 'em
The reverend talk, we booin' him
We throw up the Piru at him

[Verse]
Welcome to the funeral, closed casket as usual
Soul snatching, that's usual
Amen, hallelujah though
Whole family delusional
Niggas cryin' like two-year-olds
Bullet holes come through the doors
I just crossed my heart, then I threw a rose
Damn, welcome to your funeral
Everybody knew you, bro
Ain't nobody shootin', though
Gotta die to see who you know
Damn, welcome to the funeral
Where we from, we ruin them
The preacher preach, we shootin' him
Now we need one for you and him
That's why they should cremate ya
Hope when you die they commemorate you
Life is a movie and it's in theaters
Some of y'alls already went to cable
Get shot from afar, you can get a facial
Black gun, chrome gun, interracial
Weed so strong, need ventilation
Funeral home need renovation
I got your mom's teary-eyed, that's precipitation
Nigga, when you died, did your bitch a favor
Nigga, we gon' mob like the Genoveses
Nigga, fat mob, I'ma Jenny Craig 'em
Drive-bys in a Winnebago
Snipers never hit a baby, crib or cradle
Sit tomatoes on your head and split tomatoes
From a hundred feet away, now it's a halo
That's tomato sauce, Heinz 57
Catch up, nigga, you behind, where I left you
I hate your bitch, your mom, and your fellas, kids, cousins
Uncles, aunts, and your nephew (Pfft)
Shoot a pussy nigga in the face, closed casket
Look his pretty kid in the face, poor bastard
Tears runnin' down his bitch face, romantic
Two straps on me like the old Bo Jacksons (Bah)
In his face, closed casket
Send him on the highway to heaven, no traffic
My lil' nigga just caught a body, he ecstatic
He cried tears of joy, then he got 'em tatted
Welcome to the funeral, closed casket as usual
Whole family delusional
Amen, hallelujah though
Choir singing musicals, Kumbaya, it's beautiful
I bust in with the Uzi though
They look like they saw Lucifer
Yeah, welcome to the funeral
Everybody knew you, bro
Ain't nobody shootin' though
That's just unexcusable
Damn, welcome to the funeral
Where we from, we ruin 'em
I've been to quite a few of them
My nigga, got immune to them
Damn, shoot a pussy nigga in the face, closed casket
Huh, huh, bop
Look his pretty kids in the face, poor bastards, goddamn
Drive-bys in a Winnebago
Snipers never hit a baby, crib or cradle
Sit tomatoes on your head then split tomatoes
From a hundred feet away, now it's a halo

[Outro]
In other words, the nigga dead

[Hook]
Marathons, these marathons
Marathons, oh, these marathons
Marathons, these marathons

[Chorus]

[Outro]

You know, you know, you know

[Intro]
If you don't wanna see me

[Verse 1]
Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

[Chorus]
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

[Verse 2]
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
(Don't, don't, don't)

[Chorus]
Don't show up (Don't show up), don't come out (Don't come out)
Don't start caring about me now ('Bout me now)
Walk away (Walk away), you know how (You know how)
Don't start caring about me now
Don't start now
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

[Chorus]
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now ('Bout me now, 'bout me)
So

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a fever in the ghetto
There's a fire in their eyes
I was somewhere in the middle
Left my way to Caprol High
Everybody wanna kill me
Girl just cause' you so fine

[Chorus]
Don't let them say to ya I'm not your man
I'm coming straight for ya I'm signed and delivered
Don't let them say to ya I'm not your man
I'm coming straight for ya I'm riding fast

[Post-Chorus]
And so I'm away too long
And soon all the love will be gone
The sum of love is just too strong
And I saw love

[Pre-Chorus]
There's a fever in the ghetto
There's a fire in their eyes
I was somewhere in the middle
Left my way to Caprol High
Everybody wanna kill me
Girl just cause' you so fine

[Chorus]
Don't let them say to ya I'm not your man
I'm coming straight for ya I'm signed and delivered
Don't let them say to ya I'm not your man

[Post-Chorus]
And so I'm away too long
And soon all the love will be gone
The sum of love is just too strong
And I saw love

[Verse 1]
My girls, they came over
Told the old Doja, "Sip on this track Doja"
"I mean it'll be dank Doja, tomorrow you'll roll over, covered in old soda"
Imported from God knows
But you know you don't want a
Nother sip on top of that
Don't give me cold shoulder
When the party is all over
You gon' feel like you in coma, eh?
And 70 years older
So take it like a soldier
Lets put some mac into your Macintosh
Jacking niggas jackets, and catching these niggas jacking off (ha)
Its practically impractical, gladly i'm way tenanted
You always says tenented you know (Oh)
My niggas' bandannas, with colorful bandannas
Hoping they all colder, then polar bears
All coke in they noses
Also: 'oh, Doja just want more'
But don't fuck with them hangovers (you know)

[Chorus]
I don't fuck with them hangovers
Fuck with them hangovers, fuck with them hangovers, no
I don't fuck with them hangovers
Fuck with them hangovers, fuck with them hangovers, no

Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh, uh-huh, uh, uh-huh

[Verse 1]
Yeah, every night
My dreams seem realer then before
Appealing to the realest niggas really, but I'm poor
I'm killin' shit this is when I'm killin' feelings in the floors
To the roof, they
Testin' sillies screaming keep us off the floor (Uh)
Keep inside your mouth (Yah)
Keep this on the boards
So everytime you speed demon in the freeway and you pause
Take a couple up and still seconds to realize and record
Freedom is just a choice (Yo)
Yeah, freedom is just a choice
And a, yuh
We gettin' way more enemies
I feel like Emily, got these demons inside my belly (Yeah)
I feel my melody get us, nothin' that you could conjure
Is this the marijuana or is it cause I'mma author
Slanging the game nigga, take fame where the fame takes ya
So if you know the models then bottled it for you haters
And follow upon your paper
Follow and see the nature
Then jungle is all around you, but lions no longer chase you
Life's a drag with no tuck

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Life's a drag with no trunk
We grind with no trucks
We're gold, with no luck
We see they gettin' high and don't give no fucks
Cause all my hoes gold, and digits and toes done, ayy
Sick of yo old stuff and niggas is cold cut
They always going in the venue with gold guns, like
Showin' they fall off and niggas keep doin' us like (Ooh, ooh)
Cause you tough in the time it all took, uh
That I realize they're inside, they all shook
Some say I am spineless I don't own books, and I am just the author, author to the crooks, I'm
Further that I should be obviously true, all the pussy that I've been in, aw, should make me ill
Coughing all the bills, and parkin' in the hills
My mind sets kinda off but prolly cause I feel, so
Can't stop the memory without devil
Sometimes you gotta hit rock bottom to reach my level
Sometimes you gotta get passed all of them and test 'em
I wish I could see to all thems preceptions
This is a bitch, smokin' off my septum
See me and my niggas don't regret nothing, nah-ah
This ain't fo' yo' kids so mama viewer discretion
I-  I wan' cha, I warned cha'
I warned' cha, I warned y'all niggas
Uhmmmmm

Please forgive me I will love you
If you mend my broken heart

All the flowers in the park
I am standing like a sundial
Waiting for you til it's dark
Please remember that we're living
This is what we have to start

[Verse 2]
Please forgive me I was late
Busy fixing broken darts
I will show you if you wait
Shoot one through diamonds and hearts
I am watching like a sheriff
High above you as a lark
Please remind me when I'm dreaming
This is where I have to start

[Chorus]
Please forgive me, I will love you
Please forgive me, I will love you
Please forgive me, I will love you
Please forgive me, I will love you

Still see you in bed
But I'm playing with myself

Who bought you cigarettes?
Who bribed the company to come and see you, honey?

[Verse]
Bet my money on a stupid boy, I lost that
So I ran out to the track to get my ass back
I just gotta leave this place with a big win
So I found a fuckin' jockey and I shagged him (Pick it up)
Pushed him down to the ground and I kissed him in his face (In his face)
Yeah, I stole his phone, that put him in his place (In his place)
Me and the boy, we ran out of the place (The place)
Then I took that boy back to my place

[Chorus]
Stupid sheep, I just fell out of the Jeep
Stole the money in your bank account, oh no
Stupid goat, I just fell out of the boat
Stole the money in your bank account, oh no
Stupid bird, I just fell off of the Bird
Stole the money in your bank account, oh no
Stupid dog, I just fell off of my hog
Stole the money in your bank account

[Bridge]
Stupid horse and a swordfish dancer
Bet my money on a fishnet carousel
Go, go, go, go, go so fast now
Go, go, go, go, go so fast now
Racing horses at the derby
Why am I always so damn lucky?
I always have all your money
I always win all the money

[Chorus]
Stupid sheep, I just fell out of the Jeep
Stole the money in your bank account, oh no
Stupid goat, I just fell out of the boat

[Intro]
Shout to my nigga Shellcase for doin' this beat for me too
That nigga look like a praying mantis

[Verse 1]
Drunk off a hard liquor, pourin' bottles over bitches
Pourin' hollows over haters, killin' insecure niggas
Feelin' like the old Jigga, old Nas
Old BIG, new Pac, oh my God, he's alive, he drop
Bombs on your intellect
Bombin' everything from the streets to the internet
Get the instrumental wet
Then I'ma buss a nut, yep, I'm a my fuckin' nut
That is not an Escalade, that's a damn armor truck
Shoot who? Shot what?
You ain't popped shit but some bubblegum and a bump
Who you motherfuckers want?
Leave a motherfucker slumped from the fuckin' pump
He's a peanut to an elephant, put that nigga in the trunk
Might be held in Houston, lean in my pimp cup
Ridin' 84's, throw it like a shot put
Hoes on my jock like I'm from the ATL
And I know black choppers on the rooftop
Flip a nigga like he was a NBA mascot
Strip a nigga from his wave cap to his tube socks
Got it from my grandpops, raised on them Compton blocks
Every day caught a fade like we on the barbershop
Goons in the parkin' lot
Ooh, you's a fool if you bark a lot with no bite
Like an iguana, get killed right in front of your momma
Hold tight, coroner coming
Summertime, perfect time for duck hunting
And your women wanna be in my house
With her ass out, she climax, then pass out
Like promotional flyers, K Dot be the flyest
Eat ten rappers a day, now that's a hell of a diet

[Chorus]
Your girlfriend, she all on me
Say she wanna clean my dirty laundry
Say she wanna clean my dirty laundry
Bitch, I'm K Dot and I'm keepin' it friendly

[Verse 2]
I got this jumpin' like a kangaroo, pumpin' like a fist do
From the pro black, this is automatic rap
Have a seat, grab a snack, we gon' be here for a second
Armageddon might be here, when I finish, pray that Heaven has a home
I'm alone in my own galaxy
You'll never have a head start with a dead battery
And they screamin' agony, when I write shit
My life is filled with excitin'
Visions of a nigga making mill's with a strikin'
Impact for ten years, I've been here before
See, this is all premature
I start the war like an instigator
Sharper than some cream gators
On a Thursday night, mix the Vodka with the Sprite
Better yet, roll the dice, watch me come up
He want to 

[?] with me, he cool, put your gun up

Sleepin' on the racks last night, I done fucked around and woke up with a crick in my neck
Got so lit last night, woke up with a buttnaked bitch in my jet
Iced out baguettes on my chest
Bouldercrest tatted in ink on my flesh
I'm the boss, it's a brick on my desk
Brain so good, yeah, she cheat on her test
Got so high one night, woke up with an ice cream cone on my cheek (How?)
Last night dripped so hard courtside, had to call the mop boy to my seat (Wow)
At the Super Bowl in my suite (Yeah)
Ballin' so hard, need cleats (Ballin')
Human highlight like 'Nique ('Nique)
And my diamonds are so unique (Bling)
Heard the alphabet boys still watchin' me
All this D&G on me and my freak (Dolce)
Versace fork and plate when I eat and sleep
And I don't like to talk, talk cheap (Cheap)
Last night, me and my peeps (Peeps)
Pulled up to the yacht three deep (Deep)
Hundred bad bitches like Freaknik
Diamonds dancing on me like yee (Iceburg)

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
Niggas buy hoes, I buy clothes (yeah)
In a SRT8 on a bumpy road
Cops just pulled up on me in a Lamborghini (noo, skrt skrt)
Scared from cops, them bitches gotta hit it hard (skrt skrt)
My son think I got ginny toaster
Be there ohh if you need me (Bang Bang)
Diamonds move like the lights at the motherfuckin' casino
Cops got behind me, got crunchy on them bitches like Cheetos
I'll shoot the shit outta Deebo
And baby I’m fly like a hero (bang bang)

[Verse 2: OJ Da Juiceman]
Let these fish take a swim, ayy
Still catchin' plays by Crim, yeah

Yay still jumpin' out the gym, yeah

"Are you OK?
You've been shot in the head
And I'm holding your brains,"
The old woman said

So I drink in the shadows of an evening sky
See nothing at all

[Chorus]
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes away
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes
I praise to you

[Verse 2]
The stars look so special
And the snow looks so old
The frail form is drifting
Beyond the yoga zone
Time to question the mountain: Why pigs can fly?
It's nothing at all

[Chorus]
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes away
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes
I praise to you

[Chorus]
I praise to you
Nothing ever goes away
I praise to you

Ah ah, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come-up
This is awes-awes-awesome!

[Verse 1]
Walk into the club like "WADDUP! I GOT A BIG, BIG..."
Nah, I just pumped, bought some **** from the thrift shop
Ice on the fridge, it's just so damn frosty
The people like: Damn, that's a cold-ass honky!
Rollin' in hella deep, headed to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink except my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girl's standin' next to me
Probably shoulda washed this, smells like (smells like) sheets
(Shizzzzzzzzzz...)
But ishh, it was ninety nine cents! (Bag it)
Coppin' it, washin' it, 'boutta go and get some compliments
Passin' up on those moccasins someone else has been walkin' in
Bummy and grudgy, **** it, I am stuntin' and flossin'
And savin' my money and I'm hella happy, that's a bargain (CHICK!)
Imma take your grandpas style (x2)
No for real, ASK YOUR GRANDPA!
Can I have his hand-me downs? (Thank you!)
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers
Dookie brown leather jacket that I found, dig it
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a knee board
Hello hello, my ace man, my Mello
John Wayne ain't got nothin' on my fringe game, **** no
I could take some Pro Wings, make them cool, sell those
The sneaker heads would be like: Ah, he got the Velcros

[Chorus]
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
Ah ah, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come-up

[Verse 2]
Whatcha know about rockin' a wolf on your noggin?
Whatcha know about wearin' a fur fox skin?
I'm diggin', I'm diggin', I'm searching right through that luggage
One man's trash, that's another man's come-up
Thank your-

[Chorus]
I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
Ah ah, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come-up

Don't believe I can beat you, I'll see you in minutes
Same generation but me and you different

Hope that they free all my people in prison
Sip on my blunt when I see you on visits
Switch up the styles so they don't really get it
Say that it's sus, but they see you with bitches
I stay with some bitches
And a couple name brands they couldn't even spell it for quiz 'em
Just pay attention and play my position
You paid for the pussy, we know how you get it
Players gone play, but we know how you sip it
I'll show you 'bout pimping, blink
Styrofoam cup for the drink

Truth is I'm only tryna touch that

Come on, wake up and turn up with me, my love (wake up, wake up, wake up)
All these walls say you're a human being, my love (wake up, wake up, wake up)
Your life cannot be said, when you haven't lived it yet (mhm, no)
Take a chance you won't regret, with me, my love (uh huh, yeah, hit it)

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
Come to see, come to see
Fuck a wave, this might become the sea
Hungry, just like a younger me
Hunnid G's inside my Dungarees (rich)
Every night, I hit em by the three (woo!)
Every night, I pop em by the two
Every night, yeah you're the one for me
Every night I zero-one on you
Bitch I'm tweaked, I need like sixty feet
Switchin' teams, you should just quit the league
Turn around I might just fade away
Hit the three and get the victory
Every night, I hit em by the six
Every night, she call me up by five
Every night, "that's what you calling fo'?"
Every night, there's three of you to try

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Come on, wake up and turn up with me, my love (wake up)
All these walls say you're a human being, my love (ayy, yeah)
Your life cannot be said, when you haven't lived it yet (nah, mhm)
Take a chance you won't regret, with me, my love (hit it)
Come on, wake up and turn up with me, my love (wake up, wake up, wake up)
All these walls say you're a human being, my love (wake up, wake up, wake up)
Your life cannot be said, when you haven't lived it yet (mhm, no)
Take a chance you won't regret, with me, my love (uh huh, yeah, hit it)

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
A pack of woods, a bag of master kush
Throwin' money, judges throw the books
We threw some own, we look and turn to stone (wow)
Fuck a bitch, I'm too stoned to look
Every night, I hit em by the three
Every night, I pop em by the two
Every night, yeah you're the one for me
Every night I zero-one on you
Fuck 'em up, and never recollect
Fuck a brick, because I don't break a sweat
Farenheit, it feel like 105
Fear of heights, even though you want to fly
Every night, I hit em by the six
Every night, she call me up by five
Every night, "that's what you calling fo'?"
Every night, there's three of you to try

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Come on, wake up and turn up with me, my love (wake up)
All these walls say you're a human being, my love (ayy, yeah)
Your life cannot be said, when you haven't lived it yet (nah, mhm)
Take a chance you won't regret, with me, my love (hit it)
Come on, wake up and turn up with me, my love (wake up, wake up, wake up)
All these walls say you're a human being, my love (wake up, wake up, wake up)
Your life cannot be said, when you haven't lived it yet (mhm, no)
Take a chance you won't regret, with me, my love (uh huh, yeah, hit it)
I look into the mirror
And see a different girl
Hiding from herself with
Not a care in the world
Her smile pretends to fool
Those she chooses to please
If they could only see the tears she cries for help
See, I have been that girl
Didn't know which way to turn
Then one day I turned to me

I told myself to wake up
It’s gonna be a brighter day
I just have to believe that
My dreams won't have to wait
At times I've lost my mind
Had to look deep inside
And find a way to get over
Had to swallow my pride
I searched the world for and answer
But I’ve been searching too far
Because I've been here all along
I'm here to make a statement
My place I'm here to claim it
Don't tell me what my name is
I know
I'm gonna make it
I've come to far to lose it
Gotta stay focused
And find a better me

Feels like forever
Trying to work it out
Sometimes you're gonna fail
And you know
Sometime it will rain
But the sun will come
When you think it’s all said and done
You know you see the light
And everything is alright
You can do
Whatever you put your mind to
Cause you’re all that you need
Like I do just believe

You're here to make a statement
You’re place you're here to claim it
You know just what your name is
I know
You're gonna make it
You've come to far to lose it
Gotta stay focused
And find a better me

[Verse]
I'm sad that it's over
But happy it happened
Tell me, does that make sense?
Losing composure
I know that it's over
But my brain, it thinks something else
Still in denial
Looking to find the answers
But I don't know why
Yeah, it's all above me
Just tell me you love me
I need to hear it one last time
One last time I need to-

[Verse 1]
(Hey man) oh leave me alone you know
(Hey man) oh Henry, get off the phone, I gotta
(Hey man) I gotta straighten my face
This mellow thighed chick just put my spine out of place
(Hey man) my schooldays insane
(Hey man) my work's down the drain
(Hey man) well, she's a total blam-blam
She said she had to squeeze it but she, and then she

[Chorus]
Oh, don't lean on me, man, 'cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City

Is outta sight
She's all right

[Verse 2]
(Hey, man) oh, Henry, don't be unkind, go away

Oh, Suffragette
Suffragette!
As days go by and fade to nights
I still question why you left
I wonder how it didn't work out
But now you're gone
And memories all I have for now

But no, it's not over
We'll get older, we'll get over
We'll live to see the day that I hope for
Come back to me

I still believe that we'll get it right again
We'll come back to life again
We won't say another goodbye again
You'll live forever with me

Someday, someday
We'll be together
Someday, someday
We'll be together
I heard someday might be today
Mysteries of destinies
They are somehow and are someway

For all we know they come tomorrow
For today my eyes are open
My arms are raised for your embrace
My hands are here to mend what is broken

To feel again to walk on the face
I believe there is more to life
Oh, I love you much more than life itself
I believe I can change your mind
Revive what is dying inside

And someday, someday
We'll be together
Someday, someday
We'll be together
Someday, someday
We'll be together
We'll be together
We'll be together someday

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I just left your viewing at the Staples Center (I did)
Obama wrote you a letter, yeah, you made it, nigga (You made it)
I even heard you had some plans to come to Vegas with us
And them suckers could never kill you, it only made you bigger (Yeah)
And every time I see some fire, I see blue
And every time I close my eyes, see Snupe and I see you
When I be on the Westside (Westside), you know how we do (How we do)
Hustle and motivate, turning one into a two (Two)
Two into four, hurt my heart, I seen you on the floor
Do it for the hood, man, I don't even wanna do it no more
When these niggas you do it for, they'll shoot you and all
Only thing I can say is you with Allah, blessings (Blessings)
And I ain't finna sit here, act like I'm your main homie (I won't)
But when we lost you, it really put some pain on me (It did)
Got me scared to go outside without that flame on me (Brrt)
And when them niggas went against me, you ain't change on me (You ain't change on me)
Told me it was wrong or right, some of my longest nights (What you do?)
You made me cry, nigga (Cry, nigga), and I don't cry, nigga (I don't cry, nigga)
You the first one made me feel like I could die, nigga (Like I could die)
'Cause real niggas never die, you know the vibes, nigga (You know the vibes, nigga), yeah
Couple days ago, was chilling with my youngins
Seen your kids on the 'Gram, it made me sicker to my stomach (Made me sick)
And as the marathon continue, we keep running (We won't stop)
But I'm like, damn, I wish you seen that pussy coming, for real

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch]
I wish I knew when the storm came (Storm came)
How many tears did you cry when you lost someone?
We did this shit all for the gutter, woah, w-woah, woah
Did this shit for my lil' brother, woah, w-woah, woah (Brother)
Had to stare through these tears, 'cause I see you every time my eyes close (Every time my eyes)
Asking myself why you had to go, but only God knows (Only God knows)

[Verse 2: Roddy Ricch]
I was in Miami when I lost you, I ain't talk about it (Yeah)
I remember I bawled out in tears when I saw your body (Mmh)
And the flight back home, had cold days in LA (Hmm)
Had to turn off my phone, throw on the shades, and meditate
What you know 'bout wishing goin' blind to hide your tears?
Had a lot of murder on my mind, but in God, I fear
Took Yompton and Crenshaw around the globe in a year (Woah)
'Member ridin' solo, now it's Escalades in my rear (Woah)
I just hustle, motivate, be prolific, hold down the state
My big brother Hussle the great, I know Cobby Supreme relate
I know J Roc, Hoggy relate
Blacc Sam, Adam relate, Key to J Stone relate
Lauren, Pacman, it's love, I wanna see you do great

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch]

How many tears did you cry when you lost someone?

Had to stare through these tears, 'cause I see you every time my eyes close (Every time my eyes)
Asking myself why you had to go, but only God knows (Only God knows)

[Verse 1]
Okay, I watch her sip the cyanide
Just like it's fine wine
She had her summer house in Malibu, it's high tide
Smokin' doobies, watchin' Sci-Fi movies
Make her fruit smoothies, wanna swim out to the buoys, but she terrified
Drownin' in the paradigm, singin' Sweet Sweet Caroline
The notes always been sharp though
Can you swim? No, uh, where the art go
I'm chilling with some gangsters at a horror show
A lot of pot smoke, watchin' Donnie Darko
I got a meeting schedule for tomorrow
I'll probably sleep through the alarm tone

[Pre-Chorus]
And the song goes on
And the song goes on
And on and on and on and on

[Chorus]
Rolling 'round and improvisin'
Girl your mind is hypnotizin'
Flyin', hypnotizin', so excitin', hyp-hypnotizin'
Rolling 'round and improvisin'
Girl your mind is hypnotizin'
So excitin', flyin'

[Verse 2]
Yeah
She still waitin' for the right one
But she never gonna meet him the night club
Clean her life up, put away the white drugs
All the dudes is all wifed up
It's a legend in the making
Modern day prophet, follow everything I'm sayin'
Never in a rush, I'm keepin' everybody waitin'
Couldn't help but laugh at the expression on their faces (Yeah)
Okay, the flow so wicked, most prolific
Trust no bitches, mind your own business
I'm so lifted, I'm oh so lifted
I don't think I'm ever comin' down (Down)

[Pre-Chorus]
And the song goes on
And the song goes on
And on and on and on and on

[Chorus]
Rolling 'round and improvisin'
Girl your mind is hypnotizin'
Flyin', hypnotizin', so excitin', hyp-hypnotizin'
Rolling 'round and improvisin'
Girl your mind is hypnotizin'

Rio (Rio)

[Chorus]
Yeah, I wish there was a way I could take away the pain
Yeah, I wish there was a way I could give you everything
Damn, I wish there was a way I could tell you everything
But I can't, I wish I could, this shit affects me every day
Yeah, I wish there was a way I could take away the pain
Yeah, I wish there was a way I could give you everything
Damn, I wish there was a way I could tell you everything
But I can't, I wish I could, this shit affects me every day

[Verse]
Every night I saw it, skeletons in my closet
Still got all these problems, I thought money would solve 'em
Blood all on the walls and tears drop down, they fallin'
I don't even wanna think about all that, but it's like I can't help it
You say you can't help me, I gotta help myself but
I need help with that 'cause I feel so helpless
I feel like I've been to Hell and back by myself and
There ain't nothin' in the way no more, only myself is

[Bridge]
I'm in the way, I'm in the way of myself
I'm in the way, I'm in the way, I need help
Need it today, I wish I could kill this pain
I wish I could kill this pain, I wish I could kill these days

[Chorus]
Yeah, I wish there was a way I could take away the pain
Yeah, I wish there was a way I could give you everything
Damn, I wish there was a way I could tell you everything
But I can't, I wish I could, this shit affects me every day
Yeah, I wish there was a way I could take away the pain
Yeah, I wish there was a way I could give you everything
Damn, I wish there was a way I could tell you everything
But I can't, I wish I could, this shit affects me every day

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Need I say I'm awesome 

[?] Boston
Goons we're taking everything but precaution
Your bitches wanna call us and text us like Austin
Pussy make me hard, pussy niggas make me nauseous
I've been on my feet since the day I started walking
Bitch, I think I'm MC Hammer, put the nail in the coffin
Sell coke in a drought, sell pussy at an auction
Chopper got a nigga running fast enough to race horses
Around here you sniff these lines, you don't cross 'em
Kill your ass and leave you behind like an orphan
I swear it happens all the time, very often
Still getting baseball money; Barry Larkin
Around here we play for keeps, yeah, we eating, but we starving
I get me a little money, try to spread it margarine
I'm flyer than a motherfucker, all my flights chartered
My diamonds white as 

[?] Carter, gone

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uhm, I don't have a conscience, all my friends are monsters
They visit me so constant and talk to me about nonsense
Like stabbing you and then watching you fight for your life like you boxing
Deuce deuce, I smoke that OG killer Bobby Johnson
I'll olly over that bitch head, it's Hollygrove til I'm fucking dead
This rap shit ain't nothing in me, I swear this shit's like cotton bread
But I still go hard with no regard, Earth ain't shit, bitch, go to Mars
Leave a nigga dead in the gutter
I'll just beat him with a bloody ass bowlingball
I'm fresh as hand sanitizer, don't hate the game, just analyze it
Two xanax', I'm fantasizing about fat bitches' panty sizes
Take a bullet to the chest, be a man about it
Stop acting like a little bitch nigga, most of y'all niggas is bitch niggas
I got a tiger in the basement, Big Tigger
My hair long, my dick bigger
My hair long, my dick bigger
My hair long, my dick bigger
My money longer, my weed stronger
I feed hunger, I no longer get my weed from Fee
But we still tight like dyke pussy, that's my brother MOB
Gone

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Oh, you don't compare, don't fit in with 'em, do you get me?
Judgin' by the way you open up, you get me
Ooh, out of this world, hands-on, baby, now you send me
Lookin' at the way we're blendin' in, you get me

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Ha-ha-ha, you get me
Ha-ha-ha, you get me

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
See, you're lookin' beyond the surface
Can tell by the questions you're asking
You got me low-key nervous
It feels like we're on the same wave, yeah
Never intended to relate, I mean, what are the chances?
Never thought I'd connect with you, not in these circumstances

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Oh, you don't compare, don't fit in with 'em, do you get me?
Judgin' by the way you open up, you get me
Ooh, out of this world, hands-on, baby, now you send me
Lookin' at the way we're blendin' in, you get me

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Ha-ha-ha, you get me
Ha-ha-ha, you get me

[Verse 2: Kehlani]
Ooh, there's so much chemistry
Like a chemist, how you finishin' my sentences
In the center, no, we can't deny this energy
How 'bout reapin' all the benefits? Yeah
Never intended to relate, I mean, what are the chances?
Never thought I'd connect with you, not in these circumstances, no

[Pre-Chorus: Both, Kehlani & Justin Bieber]
Oh, you don't compare, don't fit in with 'em, do you get me?
Judgin' by the way you open up, you get me (Yeah, you really get me, ooh)
Ooh, out of this world, hands-on, baby, now you send me (Ooh, that's where you send me)
Lookin' at the way we're blendin' in, you get me (Ooh, you really get me)

[Chorus: Both & Justin Bieber]
Ha-ha-ha, you get me (Ooh)
Ha-ha-ha, you get me (Oh, oh)

[Outro: Kehlani]
Get me, yeah
Get me, yeah
Get me, yeah
Get me, yeah

[Verse 1]
Not sure what I was doing before ya
I quit tryna figure it out
Nothin' like havin' someone for you
Someone beside you when it's time to lay down
Fully committed, you're here for the stay down
Look in the mirror, you right for the takedown

[Chorus]
Room for you in my coupe, let me open up the door
Open up my eyes to a feelin' I can't ignore
I need you all around me
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I need you all around me
Wouldn't wanna be in any other place

[Post-Chorus]
From my home to the road
I'll make sure you're comfortable
You make sure I'm comfortable
Our love's unconditional
I need you all around me
All around me, yeah

[Verse 2]
Never thought I could ever be loyal
To someone other than myself
I never thought I could ever be a spoiler
Guess anything is possible with your help
Anything's possible since you made my heart melt
Gave me the best hand that I'd ever been dealt

[Chorus]
Room for you in my coupe, let me open up the door
Open up my eyes to a feelin' I can't ignore
I need you all around me, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I need you all around me
Wouldn't wanna be in any other place

[Post-Chorus]
From my home to the road
I'll make sure you're comfortable
You make sure I'm comfortable
Our love's unconditional
I need you all around me
All around me, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Intro]
Na-na, da-da, da-da, da-da
Na-na, da-da, da-da, da-da

[Verse 1]
Flowers open when they feel the sunlight
Moonrise, tide change, right before our eyes
Aggressive but softly, you place your lips on my lips
We're each other's vice
Our feelings, they go deep, deeper than the touching
Deeper than the ocean, so we ain't never rushing through
Our days or our nights, ain't no repercussions
Never get enough, I'm only for your consumption

[Pre-Chorus]
Always rain the most in April
Every scale needs to be stable
Earth keeps spinnin' around, we're breathin'
So thankful

[Chorus]
My love for you's habitual, yeah (Oh, yeah)
Not for a moment, but forever
Know it sounds untraditional, oh yeah
Never ungrateful for it
That's how we both want it
Habitual
Can't nobody keep me like you
Call it unconventional
Our love is habitual, yeah

[Refrain]
Na-na, da-da, da-da, da-da
Na-na, da-da, da-da, da-da

[Verse 2]
Just to think that we've been out here this whole time
Workin' through the seasons
Never crossed paths 'til we had a reason
Now let's fast-forward, look up
A whole new perspective for life

[Pre-Chorus]
Always rain the most in April
Every scale needs to be stable
Earth keeps spinnin' around, we're breathin'
So thankful

[Chorus]
My love for you's habitual, yeah (So habitual)
Not for a moment, but forever
Know it sounds untraditional, oh yeah (No)
Never ungrateful for it (Never ungrateful)
That's how we both want it (Oh)
Habitual (Ooh, ooh)
Can't nobody keep me like you (Oh, keep me like you)
Call it unconventional (Call it unconventional)
Our love is habitual, yeah (Our love is habitual, oh)

[Outro]
Na-na, da-da, da-da, da-da
Na-na, da-da, da-da, da-da

[Verse 1]
I'm concerned when you look at my face
You're excited for no reason
I look lost with a drink in my hand
What you think is fair ain't even even
It's cold outside from my expression
Take the scarf and wrap it around my neck
Loosen up my tie

[Chorus]
At least for now
Trying to avoid disappointment
At least for now
One finger at a time, I turn the pages, yeah

[Verse 2]
Right leg crossed while you're smokin' a cigarette
Camera's on the couch, ain't nobody takin' pictures
Throw my arms around you, bear witness
The stripes on my shirt, can you read between the lines?
You sip champagne while I sip on red wine
Never mind me watchin' you, never mind the tension
Please excuse me while I dance, I forgot to mention
I'm going on strike

[Chorus]
At least for now
Trying to avoid disappointment
At least for now

[Outro]
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
At least for now, at least for now, oh

[Chorus]
You keep
You keep on forgiving me, yeah
You keep on forgiving me, yeah
And when I feel like you're all out of reasons to keep
Hey-hey
You keep on forgiving me, yeah
You keep on forgiving me, yeah, yeah, yeah, you do

[Verse 1]
Ever since I can remember
Remember never feeling good enough
All I ever did was let you down
Never understood why you stayed around
How many pieces that I've break your heart in
Just so I can put it back together
With everything, you've given me your pardon
No, I don't derserve you no, no, no
Don't deserve a love so precious
Can't nobody love like you
Every time I shut the door
You always let me right back through
Tired of myself makin' the same mistakes
Made me re-evaluate the way I live
When I'm sure you've had all you can take

[Chorus]
You keep
You keep on forgiving me, yeah
You keep on forgiving me, yeah
And when I feel like you're all out of reasons to keep
Hey-hey
You keep on forgiving me, yeah
You keep on forgiving me, yeah, yeah, yeah, you do

[Post-Chorus]
Sometimes it feels good to cry-y-y-y
Cry-y-y-y
La-la-la, la-la
Like I'm cleansing my soul, ooh-ooh
Cry-y-y-y, cry-y-y-y
La-la-la, la-la
Oh-oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
After washin' my hands, I get 'em dirty again
You always turn the water back on
You never turn your back on me, no
All I wanna do is be like you
Learn to forgive everybody like you
Never met another so patient, no replacement
For somebody like you, woah, ooh-woah

[Chorus]
You keep
You keep on forgiving me, yeah
You keep on forgiving me, yeah
And when I feel like you're all out of reasons to keep
Hey-hey
You keep on forgiving me, yeah
You keep on forgiving me, yeah, you do
Woo-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Post-Chorus]
Sometimes it feels good to cry-y-y-y
Cry-y-y-y
La-la-la, la-la
Like I'm cleansing my soul, ooh-ooh
Cry-y-y-y, cry-y-y-y
La-la-la, la-la
Oh-oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Feels like time's moving in slow motion
Just trying to occupy my mind
So that I don't go looney over you (Ooh-ooh)
Just trying to amplify the sound
To drown out all of this need for you (You, ooh)
Biting my nails, got me nervous, so anxious
See it's one o'clock now
Noon felt like three hours ago

[Chorus]
I just wanna know your E.T.A., E.T.A.​
Out the window, got me looking out the street
What's your E.T.A.?
Distance only made us grow fonder
Of one another
Be honest, what's your E.T.A.?
What's your E.T.A.?

[Verse 2]
Say you almost right here now
Just say you pulling up to my gate
Don't say the signal faded driving through the canyon
Just hurry up for my sake
I was born ready for you
Skin sweeter than cinnamon
Eyes deeper than the ocean
Love me hard like, "Where you been?"
Love me like you don't want it to end

[Chorus]
I just wanna know your E.T.A., E.T.A.​
Out the window, got me looking out the street
What's your E.T.A.?
Distance only made us grow fonder
Of one another
Be honest, what's your E.T.A.?
What's your E.T.A.?

[Outro]
Before you gotta go
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Before you gotta go
Drop a pin for me now
So I can learn your location
Thank you, yes, you're less than five minutes away from me
In your arms, rubbing on your face
Only place I wanna be
In the bed, where we lay our head
Only place I wanna be

[Intro]
You know (You know)
Love is a powerful thing (Love is a powerful thing)
I just wanna know if you're ready (I just wanna know if you're ready)

[Pre-Chorus]
Can we go on the distance? (Can we go on the distance?)
The distance (The distance, distance)
Can we go on the distance? (The distance, distance)
The distance (The distance, distance)

[Chorus]
All you gotta, baby
You gotta keep your hand up (Up)
No tappin' out (No tappin' out)
No shortcuts, no slowin' down
Gotta go the distance
Ooh, the distance
'Til the distance is over now

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh wee (Ooh wee), Ooh wee (Ooh wee)
Ooh wee (Ooh wee)
Yeah, ayy

[Verse 1]
We'll just sleep tonight
But the morning
Go home, change clothes and be back by the afternoon
We could bring in the evening
Bring it in together
When I go in
You gotta go in with me
When I turn up
You gotta turn up with me
When I want some more
Gotta some more with me
No more questioning

[Pre-Chorus]
Can we go on the distance? (Ooh, ah-ha)
The distance (Ooh, ah-ha)
Can we go on the distance? (Ooh, ah-ha)
The distance

[Chorus]
All you gotta, baby
You gotta keep your hand up (Up)
No tappin' out (No tappin' out)
No shortcuts, no slowin' down
Gotta go the distance
Ooh, the distance
'Til the distance is over now

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh wee (Ooh wee), Ooh wee (Ooh wee)
Ooh wee (Ooh wee)
Yeah, ayy

[Verse 2]
If we're arguing
'Cause we disagree
You swear that I'm telling a lie
Would you ever believe in me?
Sometimes it rains
Would you stay in the rain with me?
When it doesn't rain
Would you stand in the sun with me?
When I'm feeling pain
Would you feel the pain with me?
If it's too much too handle, let me know

[Pre-Chorus]
Can we go on the distance? (Can we go on the distance?)
The distance (The distance, distance)
Can we go on the distance? (The distance, distance)
The distance (The distance, distance)

[Chorus]
All you gotta, baby (Oh, oh-oh)
You gotta keep your hand up (Up)
No tappin' out (No tappin' out)
No shortcuts, no slowin' down
Gotta go the distance
Ooh, the distance
'Til the distance is over now

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh wee (Ooh wee), Ooh wee (Ooh wee)
Ooh wee (Ooh wee)
Yeah, ayy

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
From the beginning, it was ending
We were emotionally pending
Jeopardy, second guessing
Got all the questions to my answers

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
I'm only right here for your consumption
Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
Lookin' like it's turnin' into something

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Wednesday
It feel like a Tuesday when you met me
I remember it like it was yesterday
You just said, "Hello," I lost my sanity
Thought you was lookin' through me
Then you made me laugh with personality
When you said goodbye that was a tragedy
Had to get a lesson in anatomy
You just ran me over
Look out, watch out, got me on the defense
Thought love at first sight was just a false pretense
Took my hat off, made me pledge allegiance
Everything was in divine sequence

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
I'm only right here for your consumption
Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
Lookin' like it's turnin' into something

[Post-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Better that than turnin' into nothing (Way-oh, way-oh)
Ain't no interruptin' this eruption (Way-oh, way-oh)

[Verse 3: Lil Dicky]
LD, uh
I believe in love
Girl, you got my hopes all up
When I left you, when I met you
I called mom and told her 'bout it
I got all up on your IG and was scrollin' down for hours
I got back to 2015 and you started lookin' young, so I stopped (Ooh)
Post intercourse when you walk by (Ass, ass, ass)
More buns than a Shop Rite (Woah)
And you wanna sleep over my crib?
Let me go and get you a soft t-shirt, here (Soft tee)
What are our kids gonna be like? (Hmm)
What is your skin routine like?
Girl, just run around bed with me
I'll flirt with you all cleverly
I'll lock you down, Pat Beverley
I'll kiss your breasts all tenderly, what's up? (Breast)
How you so hot and cute? (How?)
I wanna make a language up with you
You're already drivin' me crazy, so just

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
I'm only right here for your consumption
Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
Lookin' like it's turnin' into something

[Post-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Better that than turnin' into nothing  (Way-oh, way-oh)
Ain't no interruptin' this eruption  (Way-oh, way-oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Thinkin' ’bout you, it ain't always 'bout me
Don’t make any sense in you bein' lonely
Hurry up and get here now, but don't speed
I'll never get over you up under me

[Chorus]
I'm available (Yeah-yeah)
Oh, yes, I am (Yeah-yeah)
I'm available (Yeah-yeah)
Yeah, for you, I am
Don't mean to sound desperate
But you made it like this
Say I'm number one on your to-do list
I’m available (Yeah-yeah)
I’m available

[Verse 1]
Nothin' like your hands on me
Regret the moments that they’re off me and let it sink in
Hear me talkin', don't ignore me
I was just about to call it, what you thinkin'?
Been thinkin’ 'bout you, can't get this vision out my head
Got a grip, I'm holdin' onto every thing you say
Ain't makin' this up just to get you in my bed
If you ain't left, yeah, you can go ahead

[Pre-Chorus]
Thinkin' 'bout you, it ain't always 'bout me
Don't make any sense in you bein' lonely
Hurry up and get here now, but don't speed
I'll never get over you up under me

[Chorus]
I'm available (Yeah-yeah)
Oh, yes, I am (Yeah-yeah)
I'm available (Yeah-yeah)
Yeah, for you, I am
Don't mean to sound desperate
But you made it like this
Say I'm number one on your to-do list
I'm available (Yeah-yeah)
I'm available

[Post-Chorus]
Got my arms wide open (Arms wide open)
Got my arms wide open (Arms wide open)

[Verse 2]
I get frustrated when you're busy
Lately, that's been more than often, baby, what is this?
It's like, do you even miss me?
Feelin' less than priority, you got me convinced
Convinced I'm the only one, trippin' in my head
Because in reality, you live in my bed
I'm supposed to hold onto everything you said
Yes or no question, don't leave it unread

[Chorus]
Are you available (Yeah-yeah) now?
Oh, here I am, (Yeah-yeah) oh, here I am
Are you available? (Yeah-yeah)
Just tell me, "Yeah"
'Cause for you, I am
You know I am
Don't mean to sound desperate
But you made it like this
Say I'm number one on your to-do list
Are you available (Yeah-yeah)
Like I'm available?

[Post-Chorus]
Got my arms wide open (Arms wide open)
Got my arms wide open (Arms wide open)
True love will find you in the end
You'll find out just who was your friend
Don’t be sad, I know you will
But don't give up until
True love will find you in the end

This is a promise with a catch
Only if you're looking can it find you
’Cause true love is searching too
But how can it recognize you
Unless you step out into the light?

Don't be sad, I know you will
But don't give up until
True love finds you in the end
Yeah when we pull up
Get in bumping
On the motorway 300
Miles per hour
Doors are open
Trainers smoking up the road
I call Kim like where you at
I call up Chris when I'm in France
I call up Uffie call up Luka they know where the party at
I ride with Brooke when i want Candy
Cherry gang they got that caddy
Umru goes to school on weekdays on the weekend 4aming
When we pull up on your party
Damn you know it's never stop
My fans like pop music and poppers
Guess they really know whats' up

[Intro]
OZ on the beat, yeah

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Can't go out the house, can't look at the sun
Ashin' the blunt, life of a superstar
I never have fun, just sit here in the dark
Ashin' the blunt, I'm just bein' blunt, ayy

[Verse 1: Young Thug & 6LACK]
You'll never know-ooh your true speed (Woah)
You gotta get up, you got work to do, please (Woah)
CoCo helpin' your slow speed (Woah, woah)
Chanel coat, sit from the nosebleeds (Oh, woah)
I never know where the true love be (Woah)
Took a while to learn what true love mean (Woah)
Pretty girls train to be casually (Woah)
You don't sell out the Madison Square Garden, but at least
You know where to keep your significant other, by your side
You know what to tell her to make her smile when she posed to frown
You know what to do to make her truly happy
One touch can get her nasty, I got interest in love
Like "What's up with you girl?"

[Bridge: Young Thug & 6LACK]
Without second guessin', you know where to kiss a Blood
Without second guessin', you know where to kiss and rub
Without second guessin', you can make a nigga love (Yeah, yeah)
Wait, without second guessin', you know how to make me rush home
Followin' love, sometimes end up on a dead road
I'll drop my nuts about you girl, I turn to King Kong

[Chorus: Young Thug & 6LACK]
But they'll never let me out the house, can't look at the sun (Hey)
Ashin' the blunt, life of a superstar (Yeah)
I never have fun, just sit here in the dark (Woah)
Ashin' the blunt, I'm just bein' blunt, ayy (Woah)

[Break: Young Thug & 6LACK]
So bad, I want her (Ayy, ayy)
I got soul in my body (Ayy, ayy)
I hope she know I want her so bad, ahh (Ohh, ohh)
Don't waste time (Ohh, ahh, ahh)
Baby, tell me (Ayy, ayy)
Ohh (Ayy, yeah)
Oh

[Verse 2: 6LACK]
I done made a lot but ain't reached my max (Ayy)
Niggas think they ballin' 'til they file their tax (Woah)
Gotta learn the business the hard way
Now my cup runneth over and Young Thugger thugger than Scarface
Love is hardest on the road (Yeah)
Coldest nigga out the Zone 6
She clingy but she got her own
I need that real face time, fuck a mobile phone

[Bridge: 6LACK]
Without second guessin', you know that I wanna love you
Without second guessin', you know I won't use no rubber
Without second guessin', you know I go Rambo, load up ammo
Speed down the block, crash the Lambo

[Chorus: 6LACK]
Then they'll never let me out the house, can't look at the sun
Ashin' the blunt, life of a superstar
I never have fun, just sit here in the dark
Ashin' the blunt, I'm just bein' blunt, ayy

[Post-Chorus: 6LACK]
So I let the time fly
I'm hopin' I don't let your love pass me by

[Outro: Young Thug]
Can't go out the house, I can't have fun, no
No, I'm just ashin' the blunt, woah
Life of a superstar, I never have fun
Sittin' in the dark, ashin' the blunt
I'm just bein' real, I'm just bein' blunt, woah

[Verse 1]
I don't know your phone number
I don't think I ever did
I don't know if you love coffee
Or if you could live without it

[Chorus]
Feels like we've been through war together
Feels like you've been right here forever
But I don't even know you at all

[Verse 2]
I don't know your favorite place to eat
Or what argument makes you square up to fight
I don't know your favorite way to sleep
Or if it changes every night

[Chorus]
Feels like we've been through war together
Feels like you've been right here forever
But I don't even know you at all
At all
At all

[Bridge]
I know more about your friends than I know about you
I know that they've placed their bets on us, but since we're through
They can keep the money that they've wagered on our love
And maybe, someday soon, some of them will lose
But I don't know you, and I'm guessing that you don't know me
I don't know you, so how could we expect our love to come with ease?
I could say that we were kids, but that just isn't true
I could say we wanted to believe in something new
I could give a million reasons why but they won't do
'Cause in my heart, feels like I have always known you

[Verse 3]
I don't know your phone number
I don't think I ever will
I don't care if you love coffee
Or if just one sip makes you feel sort of ill

[Outro]
Feels like we've been through war together
Feels like you've been right here forever
And that's the thing that matters most of all

[Intro: Lil Yachty & Trippie Redd]

I'm in flight just like a phoenix
Told that bitch to suck my penis

[Intro]
Turn up a little bit, yeah
First song recorded, in a hotel studio
It got me feelin' like I made it and shit, haha

[Verse 1]
She tells me that she don't know who I am
I've changed so much and she don't understand
Got me sayin', "Goddamn"
What made me this way?
And I been thinkin' that it's takin' way too long
Everything I do they think is wrong
I must move on
What made me this way?

[Chorus]
And everything better when you make a little bread (Bread)
Countin' my cash, keep the numbers in my head (Head)
King-size bed in my hotel suite (Suite)
I know I got money every time I go to sleep (Sleep)
But, what made me this way?
I used to be regular, now I'm insane
I used to cry, now I don't feel pain
Hey, what made me this way?

[Verse 2]
(I see 'em, I see 'em, I see 'em)
They watch me as I figure all this out
Money comin' in, I tried my best to keep a count
But there's no doubt
That made me this way
And they try, but never will they know the work I do
On my grind all night, the moon lights up the room
A dream come true
What made me this way?

[Chorus]
And everything better when you make a little bread (Bread)
Countin' my cash, keep the numbers in my head (Head)
King-size bed in my hotel suite (Suite)
I know I got money every time I go to sleep (Sleep)
But, what made me this way?
I used to be regular, now I'm insane
I used to cry, now I don't feel pain
Hey, what made me this way?

[Verse 3]
Countin' my money, couple thousand every night
Thinkin' to myself, "This can't be life"
Everything I'm seein', this can't be right
They must've poured a little lean in my Sprite
That's alright, that's okay
Fuck tomorrow, we here today
Hey, shit don't change
What the fuck made me this way?

[Chorus]
And everything better when you make a little bread (Bread)
Countin' my cash, keep the numbers in my head (Head)
King-size bed in my hotel suite (Suite)
I know I got money every time I go to sleep (Sleep)
But, what made me this way?
I used to be regular, now I'm insane
I used to cry, now I don't feel pain
Hey, what made me this way?

[Intro: Eminem & Dina Rae]
Mhmmm *inhales*
You high, baby?
Yeah
Yeah?
Talk to me
You want me to tell you something?
Uh-huh
I know what you wanna hear

[Refrain: Eminem (& Dina Rae)]
'Cause I know you want me, baby, I think I want you too
(I think I love you, baby) I think I love you too
I'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me, baby, you know I want you too
They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
(Oh boy, you drive me crazy) Chick, you make me hurl

[Verse 1: Eminem]
They call me Superman
Leap tall girls in a single bound
I'm single now: got no ring on this finger now
I'd never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship; save it, trick
Babysit? You make me sick
Superman ain't savin' spit
Girl, you can jump on Shady's {dick}
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I tell a giddy little girl to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips? Chick, why ask?
Kiss my grits, get my cash?
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out, I'll put you out
Won't get out, I'll push you out
Looks blew out, poppin' {shit}
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice? Buy you ice?
Trick, if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What you tryin' to be, my new wife?
What you, Mariah? Fly through twice

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
But I do know one thing though
Chickens, they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that empty runway, oh

[Chorus: Eminem]
‘Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Don't get me wrong, I love these girls
It's no secret, everybody knows
Yeah, we {fucked}: trick, so what?
That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends, I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kinda car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partyin' then
You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride, between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what girls do
How could it ever be just us two?
I'd never love you enough to trust you
We just met and I just {fucked} you

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
But I do know one thing though
Chickens, they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that empty runway, oh

[Chorus: Eminem]
‘Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman
‘Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman

[Refrain: Eminem (& Dina Rae)]
'Cause I know you want me, baby, I think I want you too
(I think I love you, baby) I think I love you too
I'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me, baby, you know I want you too
They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
(Oh boy, you drive me crazy) Chick, you make me hurl

[Verse 3: Eminem]
First thing you say: I'm not fazed
I hang around big stars all day
I don't see what the big deal is anyway
You're just plain old Marshall to me
Ooh yeah, girl, run that game
Hailie Jade, I love that name
Love that tattoo, what's that say?
"Rot In Pieces," uh, that's great
First off, you don't know Marshall
At all, so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll bump you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit
Leave footprints all across you
Good Lordy, whoadie
You must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have
Ooh girl, that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two backhands
Put {anthrax} on a Tampax
And {slap} you 'til you can't stand
Girl, you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans

[Pre-Chorus: Eminem]
But I do know one thing though
Chickens, they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that empty runway, oh

[Chorus: Eminem]
‘Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman
‘Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman

[Refrain: Eminem (& Dina Rae)]
'Cause I know you want me, baby, I think I want you too
(I think I love you, baby) I think I love you too
I'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me, baby, you know I want you too
They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world
(Oh boy, you drive me crazy) Chick, you make me hurl

[Murdoc]
Who are all these people?

[2D]
These are my friends, I've actually met these guys in Lidl in Shoreditch and we had a fight over the last stollen, I said, "Let's just split the stollen", and we started chatting about things and then he said "Um, um, I'm in this band called Slaves". And I said "Um, I'm in a band and do you wanna come hang out and do a little bit of work with us?". And he was like "Ye man, ye", and that's how it started really.

[Murdoc & Russel]
And you just brought him along, you don't know his background?
(Man, thats how it started)

[2D]
But I don't know his background, no.

[Russel]
You, you know his foreground?

[2D]
I know his foreground, it's very clear, his foreground is very clear, background is a bit hazy.

[Hook]
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes

[Verse 1]
They say only the good die young
That just ain't us
Plus you're having too much fun
You're not in a rush

[Pre-Chorus]
But it's funny how some things just change in a day, or even in an hour
​I'm like a wild caged animal, lying by the swimming pool losing all my power
It's funny how my life just stopped and shifted from meeting you as a stranger
Now I'm like a wild caged animal, lying by the swimming pool trying to avoid danger

[Chorus]
But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive
But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive

[Hook]
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes

[Verse 2]
They say only the good die young
That just ain't right
'Cause we're having too much fun
Too much fun tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
But it's funny how some things just change in a day, or even in an hour
​Now I'm like a wild caged animal, sitting by the swimming pool losing all my power
It's funny how life can change or be shaped passing by a stranger
Now I'm like a wild caged animal, lying by the swimming pool trying to avoid danger

[Chorus]
But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive
But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive

[Pre-Chorus]
It's funny how some things just change in a day, or even in an hour
​I'm like a wild caged animal, sitting by the swimming pool losing all my power
It's funny how life can change or be shaped passing by a stranger
Now I'm like a wild caged animal, lying by the swimming pool trying to avoid danger

[Chorus]
But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive
But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive

[Outro]
Ooh
Ahh
Ahh

[Verse 1]
Flames so hot that they turn blue
Palms reflecting in your eyes, like an endless summer
That's the way I feel for you
If time stood still, I'd take this moment, make it last forever

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Your halo's full of fire
I'm rising up, rising up
My hot love's full of fire
Love's full of fire
La, ah

[Chorus]
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too

[Verse 2]
Leather black and eyes of blue
Sun reflecting in your eyes, like an easy rider
Life makes sense when I'm with you
Looking back, my past
It all seems stranger than a stranger

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So let's dance in slow motion
Tear it up, tear it up
Let's dance by the ocean
Ah, ah

[Chorus]
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too

[Bridge]
Marry me, marry me
Take a long vacation
Money and power and dresses, big standing ovation
Loving you can't be wrong
There's no complications, no
Marry me, marry me
Use all your relations
Carry me, carry me
Fuck our generation
Loving you can't be wrong
Love is our salvation now

[Chorus]
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
Lyrics from snippet

Sex, coffee, money, and dresses
Sex, coffee, money, and dresses
Vacation, va-ca-ti-on
Vacation, va-ca-ti-on

[Chorus]
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them, just for one day
We can be heroes, just for one day

[Verse 1]
And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes, we're lovers, and that is that

[Refrain]
Though nothing will keep us together
We could steal time, just for one day
We can be heroes, forever and ever
What d'you say?

[Verse 2]
I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim

[Refrain]
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them, forever and ever
Oh, we can be heroes, just for one day

[Chorus]
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be us, just for one day

[Verse 3]
I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing, by the wall (By the wall)
And the guns shot above our heads (Over our heads)
And we kissed, as though nothing could fall (Nothing could fall)

[Refrain]
And the shame was on the other side
Oh, we can beat them, forever and ever
Then we could be heroes, just for one day
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be heroes

[Outro]
We're nothing, and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer, just for one day
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, just for one day

[Verse 1]
You're just a little girl with grey eyes
Never mind, say something
Wait until the crowd cries
Oh, wait until the crowd cries
You're just a little girl with grey eyes

[Chorus]
So deep in your room
You never leave your room
Something deep inside of me
Yearning deep inside of me
Talking through the gloom
What in the world can you do?
What in the world can you do?
I'm in the mood for your love
For your love
For your love
For your love

[Verse 2]
I'm just a little bit afraid of you
'Cause love won't make you cry
But, wait until the crowd goes
Oh, wait until the crowd goes
I'm just a little bit afraid of you

[Chorus]
So deep in your room
You never leave your room
Something deep inside of me
Yearning deep inside of me
Is talking through the gloom
What in the world can I do?
What in the world can I do?
I'm in the mood for your love
For your love
For your love

[Outro]
Oh, what you going to say?
Oh, what you going to do?
Ah, what you going to be?
To the real me
To the real me

[Verse]
Sometimes you get so lonely
Sometimes you get nowhere
I've lived all over the world
I've left every place

[Chorus]
Please be mine
Share my life
Stay with me
Be my wife

[Verse]
Sometimes you get so lonely
Sometimes you get nowhere
I've lived all over the world
I've left every place

[Chorus]
Please be mine
Share my life
Stay with me
Be my wife

[Outro]
Sometimes you get so lonely
We just keep going then, shall we?
Why, I wonder, is my heart full of holes
And the feeling goes but my hair keeps growing
Will I set the sun
On a big-wheeled wagon
I'm bragging
I'm always in love

When I let go of your throat-sweet throttle
When I clean the lash of your black-belt model
Will I catch the moon
Like a bird in a cage
It's for you I swoon
I'm always in love

I don't get the connection
If this is only a test
I hope I do my best
You know I won't forget

When I fold the cold in my jet-lag palm
When I soak so long I forget my mother
Will I set the sun
On a big-wheeled wagon
I'm bragging
I'm always in love
It's a drag I sang
I'm always in love
I'm worried
I'm always in love

I'm worried
I'm worried
I'm worried
I'm always in love

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
A small Jean Genie snuck off to the city
Strung out on lasers and slash back blazers
And ate all your razors while pulling the waiters
Talking 'bout Monroe and walking on Snow White
New York's a go-go and everything tastes nice
Poor little Greenie
Woo-hoo

(Get back one)

[Chorus]
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie) he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go, oh

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Sits like a man, but he smiles like a reptile
She loves him, she loves him, but just for a short while
She'll scratch in the sand, won't let go his hand
He says he's a beautician and sells you nutrition
And keeps all your dead hair for making up underwear
Poor little Greenie

[Chorus]
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie) he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go, whoa-oh

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
He's so simple minded, he can't drive his module
He bites on the neon and sleeps in the capsule
Loves to be loved
Loves to be loved

[Bridge]
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo

[Chorus]
Oh, the Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie) he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go, oh
Go
Go

[Chorus]
The Jean Genie lives on his back
The Jean Genie loves chimney stacks
(The Jean Genie) he's outrageous, he screams and he bawls
The Jean Genie, let yourself go, oh
Go
Go, go

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
Oh you, you walk on past
Your lips cut a smile on your face
(Your scalding face)
To the cage, to the cage
She was a beauty in a cage
It's too, too high a price
To drink rotting wine from your hands
(Your fearful hands)

[Verse 2]
Get me to a doctor's, I've been told
Someone's back in town, the chips are down
I just cut and blackout
I'm under Japanese influence and my honour’s at stake
The weather's grim, ice on the cages
Me, I'm Robin Hood, and I puff on my cigarette
Panthers are steaming, stalking, screaming

[Verse 3]
If you don't stay tonight
I will take that plane tonight
I've nothing to lose, nothing to gain
I'll kiss you in the rain, kiss you in the rain
(Kiss you in the rain) Kiss you in the rain (Kiss you in the rain)
In the rain (In the rain)

[Bridge]
Get me to the doctor

[Outro]
Get me off the streets
(Get some protection)
Get me on my feet
(Get some direction)
Hot air gets me into a blackout
Oh, get me off the streets
Get some protection
Oh get me on my feet (wo-ooh!)
While the streets block off
Getting some skin exposure to the blackout
(Get some protection)
Get me on my feet
(Get some direction, wo-ooh!)
Oh get me on my feet
Get me off the streets
(Get some protection)

[Chorus]
Don't you wonder sometimes
'Bout sound and vision?

[Verse]
Blue, blue, electric blue
That's the colour of my room
Where I will live
Blue, blue
Pale blinds drawn all day
Nothing to do, nothing to say
Blue, blue
I will sit right down
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
And I will sing
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
Drifting into my solitude
Over my head

[Chorus]
Don't you wonder sometimes
'Bout sound and vision?

[Verse 1]
Baby, I've been
Breaking glass in your room again
Listen

[Verse 2]
Don't look at the carpet
I drew something awful on it
See

[Verse 3]
You're such a wonderful person
But you got problems oh-oh-oh-oh
I'll never touch you

[Verse 1]
Fame, (fame) makes a man take things over
Fame, (fame) lets him loose, hard to swallow
Fame, (fame) puts you there where things are hollow
Fame (fame)

[Chorus 1]
Fame, it's not your brain, it's just the flame
That burns your change to keep you in... sane (sane)
Fame (fame)

[Verse 2]
Fame, (fame) what you like is in the limo
Fame, (fame) what you get is no tomorrow
Fame, (fame) what you need you have to borrow
Fame (fame)

[Chorus 2]
Fame, "Nein! It's mine!" is just his line
To bind your time, it drives you to... crime
Fame (fame)

[Bridge]
Could it be the best, could it be?
Really be, really, babe?
Could it be, my babe, could it, babe?
Could it, babe? Could it, babe?

[Verse 3]
Is it any wonder I reject you first?
Fame, (fame) fame, fame, fame (fame)
Is it any wonder you are too cool to fool
Fame (fame)

[Chorus 3]
Fame, bully for you, chilly for me
Got to get a rain check on... pain (pain)
(Fame)

[Outro]
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame, fame
Fame
What's your name?
(Feeling so gay, feeling gay)

[Verse 1]
Weaving down a byroad
Singing the song
That's my kind of highroad
Gone wrong

[Chorus]
My-my, smile at least
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast

[Verse 2]
Something in the night
Something in the day
Nothing is wrong but darling
Something's in the way
There's slaughter in the air
Protest on the wind
Someone else inside me
Someone could get skinned, how?

[Chorus]
My-my, someone fetch a priest
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast, darling

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
My-my
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast
My-my
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast

[Bridge]
I wanted to believe me
I wanted to be good
I wanted no distractions
Like every good boy should, my-my

[Verse 3]
Nothing will corrupt us
Nothing will compete
Thank God heaven left us
Standing on our feet

[Chorus]
My-my, Beauty and the Beast, my-my
Just Beauty and the Beast
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast, darling
My-my, my-my

[Verse 1]
Pushing through the market square
So many mothers sighing
News had just come over
We had five years left to cry in (cry in)
News guy wept and told us
Earth was really dying (dying)
Cried so much his face was wet
Then I knew he was not lying (lying)
I heard telephones, opera house, favourite melodies
I saw boys, toys, electric irons and TVs
My brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare
I had to cram so many things to store everything in there
And all the fat, skinny people
And all the tall, short people
And all the nobody people
And all the somebody people
I never thought I'd need so many people

[Verse 2]
A girl my age went off her head
Hit some tiny children
If the Black hadn't have pulled her off
I think she would have killed them
A soldier with a broken arm
Fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest
And a queer threw up at the sight of that
I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlour
Drinking milkshakes cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine
Don't think you knew you were in this song
And it was cold and it rained, so I felt like an actor
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there
Your face, your race
The way that you talk
I kiss you, you're beautiful
I want you to walk

[Outro]
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, what a surprise
Five years, stuck on my eyes
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
Five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
We've got five years, what a surprise
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot
Five years, that's all we've got
Five years
Five years
Five years
Five years

[Verse 1]
Stone love - she kneels before the grave
A brave son - who gave his life
To save the slogan
That hovers between the headstone and her eyes
For they penetrate her grieving
New love - a boy and girl are talking
New words - that only they can share in
New words - a love so strong it tears their hearts
To sleep - through the fleeting hours of morning

[Chorus]
Love is careless in its choosing
Sweeping over cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none
Just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love
And love is not loving

[Solo]

[Verse 2]
Soul love - the priest that tastes the word and
Told of love - and how my God on high is
All love - though reaching up my loneliness
Evolves, by the blindness that surrounds him

[Chorus]
Love is careless in its choosing
Sweeping over cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none
Just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love
And love is not loving

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
Tony went to fight in Belfast
Rudi stayed at home to starve
I could make it all worthwhile as a rock & roll star
Bevan tried to change the nation
Sonny wants to turn the world, well, he can tell you that he tried
I could make a transformation as a rock & roll star

[Chorus]
So inviting - so enticing to play the part
I could play the wild mutation as a rock & roll star

[Bridge]
I could do with the money (You know that I could)
I'm so wiped out with things as they are
(You know that I could)
I'd send my photograph to my honey
And I'd c'mon like a regular superstar

[Chorus 2]
I could make a transformation as a rock & roll star

[Chorus 1]
So inviting - so enticing to play the part
I could play the wild mutation as a rock & roll star
Get on with the money

[Bridge]
I could do with the money (You know that I could)
I'm so wiped out with things as they are
(You know that I could)
I'd send my photograph to my honey
And I'd c'mon like a regular superstar

[Verse 2]
I could fall asleep at night as a rock & roll star
I could fall in love all right as a rock & roll star

[Outro]
Rock & roll star
Rock & roll star
(Just watch me now)

[Intro]

[Chorus 1]
The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes

[Verse 1]
Here are we, one magical moment
Such is the stuff, from where dreams are woven
Bending sound, dredging the ocean
Lost in my circle
Here am I, flashing no color
Tall in this room overlooking the ocean
Here are we, one magical movement
From Kether to Malkuth
There are, you drive like a demon
From station to station

[Chorus 1]
The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke
Throwing darts in lovers' eyes
The return of the Thin White Duke
Making sure white stains

[Verse 2]
Once there were mountains on mountains
And once there were sun birds to soar with
And once I could never be down
Got to keep searching and searching
And oh, what will I be believing
And who will connect me with love?
Wonder who, wonder who, wonder when
Have you sought fortune, evasive and shy?
Drink to the men who protect you and I
Drink, drink, drain your glass, raise your glass high

[Verse 3]
It's not the side-effects of the cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love

[Chorus 2]
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is near

[Verse 4]
I must be only one in a million
I won't let the day pass without her

[Chorus 2]
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here

[Verse 5]
Should I believe that I've been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?

[Chorus 2]
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
It's too late, It's too late
It's too late, It's too late
It's too late
The European canon is near

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
It's not the side-effects of the cocaine
I'm thinking that it must be love

[Chorus]
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here

[Verse 4]
I must be only one in a million
I won't let the day pass without her

[Chorus]
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here

[Verse 5]
Should I believe that I've been stricken?
Does my face show some kind of glow?

[Chorus]
It's too late to be grateful
It's too late to be late again
It's too late to be hateful
The European canon is here, yes it's here
It's too late, It's too late
It's too late, It's too late
It's too late
The European canon is here

[Verse 1]
Well, she's a tongue twisting storm
She'll come to the show tonight
Praying to the light machine
She wants my honey not my money
She's a funky-thigh collector
Laying on electric dreams

[Chorus]
Well, come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well, come on, well, come on
If you think we're gonna make it you better hang on to yourself

[Verse 2]
We can't dance, we don't talk much, we just ball and play
But then we move like tigers on Vaseline
Well, the bitter comes out better on a stolen guitar
You're the Blessed, we're The Spiders From Mars

[Chorus]
Well, come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well, come on, well come on
If you think we're gonna make it you better hang on to yourself

[Bridge]
Come on
Lay it on

[Chorus]
Come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well, come on, well, come on
If you think we're gonna make it you better hang on to yourself

[Chorus]
Well, come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well, come on, well, come on
If you think we're gonna make it you better hang on to yourself

[Outro]
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah

[Intro]
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Now Ziggy played guitar
Jamming good with Weird and Gilly
And The Spiders from Mars
He played it left hand
But made it too far
Became the special man
Then we were Ziggy's Band

[Verse 2]
Ziggy really sang
Screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo
Like some cat from Japan
He could lick 'em by smiling
He could leave 'em to hang
He came on so loaded, man
Well hung, snow white tan

[Chorus 1]
So where were the spiders
While the fly tried to break our balls?
Just the beer light to guide us
So we bitched about his fans
And should we crush his sweet hands?
Oh yeah

[Verse 3]
Ziggy played for time
Jiving us that we were Voodoo
The kids was just crass
He was the naz
With God-given ass
He took it all too far
But boy, could he play guitar

[Chorus 2]
Making love with his ego
Ziggy sucked up into his mind (ah)
Like a leper messiah
When the kids had killed a man
I had to break up the band

[Bridge]
Oh yeah
Ooh

[Outro]
Ziggy played guitar

[Intro]
Doo doo doo-doo doo doo-doo doo

You've got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright

You love bands when they're playing hard

{Bridge}

[Outro]
You've torn your dress, your face is a mess
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
You've got your transmission and your live wire
You got your cue line and a handful of ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes
And I love your dress
You're a juvenile success
Because your face is a mess
So how could they know?
I said, how could they know?
So what you wanna know?
Calamity's child, chi-chi, chi-chi
Where'd you wanna go?
What can I do for you? Looks like you've been there too
'Cause you've torn your dress
And your face is a mess
Ooh, your face is a mess
Ooh, ooh, so how could they know?
Ah, ah, how could they know?
Ah, ah

[Verse 1]
(Hey man) oh leave me alone you know
(Hey man) oh Henry, get off the phone, I gotta

This mellow thighed chick just put my spine out of place
(Hey man) my schooldays insane
(Hey man) my work's down the drain
(Hey man) well, she's a total blam-blam
She said she had to squeeze it but she, and then she

[Chorus]
Oh, don't lean on me, man, 'cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man, 'cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
She's all right

[Verse 2]
(Hey, man) oh, Henry, don't be unkind, go away
(Hey, man) I can't take you this time, no way

There's only room for one and here she comes, here she comes

Oh, don't lean on me, man, 'cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City

Don't lean on me, man, 'cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City

You know my Suffragette City

Oh show me the way to the next whiskey bar
Oh don't ask why, no don't ask why
For we must find the next whiskey bar
Or if we don't find the next whiskey bar

[Pre-Chorus]
I tell you we must die

Oh moon of Alabama, it's time to say goodbye
We've lost our good old mama
And must have whiskey or you know why

[Intro: 2-D]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Momentary bliss

[Chorus: Isaac Holman]
We could do so much better than this
Mausoleum faces and momentary bliss
We could do so much better than this
Oh, Rita, oh, Rita

[Segue: 2-D]
Lovely Rita, meter maid
Lovely Rita, meter maid

[Verse 1: slowthai & 2-D]
Your potential, you lack credentials
And you are special, so fucking special (Rita)
Oh, how you need it, oh, how you're needed
And you keep squeezing the tube from the middle (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
You part the seas, but your arches, they ain't golden (Ah)
And you was gagging for some gags so now you're rolling (Woo)
Best you shut your trap and keep it hush (Hush)
On another note, compliments make me blush
There's a hole in your pocket, so you cannot find the change
Cavern of your mind, you say you're patterned
You pull your strings and you jump, hold your mouth and you say (Ah, ah, ah)
"What was scripted, the day before it happened?"
We all give applause when people open doors
But on the way out it did your back in
See, everything in life ain't silver and gold
But mining for metal gave you platinum

[Refrain: slowthai]
It makes me sick to think you ain't happy in your skin
It's wearing thin to think light bulb don't blink
It just flickers, so dim, then it pops and withers
You're a Turkey Twizzler, you deserve school dinners
Makes me sick

[Bridge: 2-D]
Poster boy (Ayy)
Poster girl (Rita)
In truth, the bills (The bills)
Must be paid (Yeah, yeah, alright)
Poster boy (Yeah, alright)
Poster girl (Ah, that's time)

[Verse 2: 2-D]
In truth, the bills, they must be paid (Uh-huh)
And what is left is sodden cake, typical
Oh, you need to change your face
You're getting sold, it's such a waste
Y'know, we could do so much better than this
Swimming in pools of momentary bliss
Where you gotta bite the bounty 'cause everybody taking it
Meanwhile, you keep on adding
How big you gonna grow?

[Refrain: slowthai]
It makes me sick to think you ain't happy in your skin
It's wearing thin, to think light bulb don't blink
It just flickers, so dim, then it pops and withers
You're a Turkey Twizzler, you deserve school dinners
It makes me sick to think you ain't happy in your skin
It's wearing thin, to think light bulbs don't blink
It just flickers, so dim, then it pops and withers
You're a Turkey Twizzler, you deserve school dinners
Makes me sick

[Chorus: Isaac Holman]
We could do so much better than this
Mausoleum faces and momentary bliss
We could do so much better than this
Oh, Rita, oh, Rita
We could do so much better than this
Perfect little pictures of moments that we missed
We could do so much better than this
Oh, Rita, oh, Rita

Be with my baby, then we'll spend some time together

[Verse 1]
This week dragged past me so slowly
The days fell on their knees
Maybe I'll take something to help me
Hope someone takes after me
I guess there's always some change in the weather
This time I know we could get it together
If I did casually mention tonight
That would be crazy tonight

[Chorus]
Stay - that's what I meant to say
Or do something, but what I never say is
Stay this time, I really meant to so bad this time
'Cause you can never really tell
When somebody wants something you want too

[Verse 2]
Heart wrecker, heart wrecker, make me delight
Life is so vague when it brings someone new
This time tomorrow I'll know what to do
I know it's happened to you

Stay - that's what I meant to say
Or do something, but what I never say is
Stay this time, I really meant to so bad this time

You got mud on your face, you big disgrace
Kicking your can all over the place, singing

We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you

Buddy, you’re a young man, hard man
Shouting in the street, gonna take on the world someday
You got blood on your face, you big disgrace
Waving your banner all over the place

[Chorus]
We will, we will rock you
Sing it out
We will, we will rock you

Buddy, you're an old man, poor man
Pleading with your eyes, gonna make you some peace someday
You got mud on your face, big disgrace

We will, we will rock you, everybody
We will, we will rock you, hmm

[Intro]
Hey, it's a sellout!
Hey!

[Verse 1]
Let me welcome you, ladies and gentlemen
I would like to say hello
Are you ready for some entertainment? Are you ready for a show?
Gonna rock you, gonna to roll you, get you dancing in the aisles
Jazz you, razzamatazz you with a little bit of style

[Chorus]
C'mon, let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you

[Verse 2]
I've come here to sell you my body
I can show you some good merchandise
I'll pull you and I'll pill you, I'll Cruella DeVille you
And to thrill you, I'll use any device
Ah, ha ha ha ha...
We'll give you crazy performance
We'll give you grounds for divorce
We'll give you piece de resistance
And a tour de force, of course!
We found the right location
Got a lot of pretty lights
The sound and amplification, listen, hey!
If you need a fix, if you want a high, Stickells'll see to that
With Elektra and EMI, we'll show you where it's at

[Chorus]
So c'mon, let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you
Let me entertain you

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Just take a look at the menu
We give you rock a la carte
We'll breakfast at Tiffany's
We'll sing to you in Japanese
We're only here to entertain you
If you wanna see some action, you get nothing but the best
The S and M attraction, we've got the pleasure chest
Chicago down to New Orleans, we get you on the line
If you dig the New York scene
We'll have a son-of-a-bitch-of-a-time

[Chorus]
Come on, let me entertain
Let me entertain
Let me entertain you
Through the night

[Skit]

[Freddie] Hey, where's my backstage pass?

[Roger] That was a bit of a riot, yeah?

[Brian] Good - great one, outrageous costume!

[Freddie] Hey, that Brian May, he's outta sight, man!

[Roger] Not many, not many... no, it's true!

[Brian] Woah, what is up with that? Funny...

[Woman] I always wanted to be a groupie!

[Roger] Oh man, I could give less of a shit if you wanted... C'mon!

[Woman] Oh, oh!

[Verse 1]
She keeps a Moët et Chandon in her pretty cabinet
Let them eat cake she says, just like Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy for Khrushchev and Kennedy (Ooh, ooh)
At anytime an invitation, you can't decline (Ooh, ooh)
Caviar and cigarettes, well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice

[Chorus]
She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind (Pa-pa-pa-pa)
(Anytime)
Ooh
Recommended at the price
Insatiable in appetite
Wanna try?

[Verse 2]
To avoid complications, she never kept the same address
In conversation, she spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China, went down to Geisha Minah (Ooh, ooh)
(Killer, killer, she's a killer Queen)
Then again incidentally, if you're that way inclined
Perfume came naturally from Paris (Naturally)
For cars, she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise

[Chorus]
She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
(Pa-pa-pa-pa)
Anytime

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Drop of a hat she's as willing as, playful as a pussy cat
(Ooh)
Then momentarily out of action (Ooh)
Temporarily out of gas (Ta-taaa)
To absolutely drive (Drive you wild, wild)
She's all out to get you

Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam (Pa-pa-pa-ra)
Guaranteed to blow your mind

Insatiable in appetite
Wanna try?

[Verse 1]
The machine of a dream
Such a clean machine
With the pistons a pumping
And the hubcaps all gleam

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When I'm holding your wheel
All I hear is your gear
When my hand's on your grease gun
Oh it's like a disease, son

[Chorus 1]
I'm in love with my car
Got to feel for my automobile
Get a grip on my boy racer roll bar
Such a thrill when your radials squeal

[Verse 2]
Told my girl I'll have to forget her
Rather buy me a new carburetor
So she made tracks saying this is the end now
Cars don't talk back, they're just four-wheeled friends, now

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When I'm holding your wheel
All I hear is your gear
When I'm cruising in overdrive
Don't have to listen to no run-of-the-mill talk jive

[Chorus 2]
I'm in love with my car (Ooh, I'm in love with my car)
Got to feel for my automobile (Ooh)
I'm in love with my car (Ooh, I'm in love with my car)
String back gloves in my automolove (Ooh)

Get down, make love
Get down, make love
Get down, make love
Get down, make love

You take my body, I give you heat
You say you're hungry, I give you meat
I suck your mind, you blow my head
Make love (Make love) inside your bed
Everybody get down, make love

[Refrain]
Get down, make love
Get down, make love
Get down, make love

[Chorus]
Every time I get hot, you wanna cool down
Every time I get high, you say you wanna come down
You say it’s enough, in fact, it's too much
Every time I get a, get down, get down
Get down, make love

[Verse 2]
(Get down) I can squeeze, (make love) you can shake me
(Get down) I can feel (make love) when you break me
(Get down) Come on so heavy (make love)

Ooh, you make me live
Whatever this world can give to me
It's you, you're all I see
Ooh, you make me live now, honey
Ooh, you make me live

[Chorus 1]
Oh, you're the best friend that I ever had
I've been with you such a long time, you're my sunshine
And I want you to know that my feelings are true
I really love you
(Ooh) Oh, you're my best friend

[Verse 2]
Ooh, you make me live
Ooh, I've been wandering 'round ('round)
But still come back to you (ooh, still come back to you)
In rain or shine, you've stood by me girl (girl)
I'm happy at home (I'm happy, happy at home)
You're my best friend

Whenever this world is cruel to me
I got you to help me forgive
Ooh, you make me live now, honey
Ooh, you make me live

You know I'll never be lonely, you're my only one

I'm happy at home

Here I stand
Look around, around, around, around, around
But you won't see me
Now I'm here
Now I'm there
I'm just a
Just a new man
Yes, you made me live again

[Verse 1]
A baby I was when you took my hand
And the light of the night burned bright
And the people all stared didn't understand
But you knew my name on sight

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Whatever came of you and me
America's new bride to be
Ooh, don't worry, baby, I'm safe and sound

[Chorus 1]
Down in the dungeon just Peaches and me
Don't I love her so?
Yeah, she made me live again
Yeah

[Verse 2]
A thin moon me in a smoke-screen sky
Where the beams of your love-light chase
Don't move, don't speak, don't feel no pain
With the rain running down my face

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Your matches still light up the sky
And many a tear lives on in my eye

[Chorus 2]
Down in the city just Hoople and me
Don't I love him so?
Ooh, don't I love him so?

[Bridge]
Whatever comes of you and me
I'd love to leave my memory with you

[Verse 3]
Now I'm here
Think I'll stay around, around, around, around, around, around
Down in the city just as you and me
Don't I love you so

[Outro]
Go, go, go, little queenie!

[Verse]
Oh, I used to be your baby
Used to be your pride and joy
You used to take me dancing
Just like any other boy
But now you've found another partner
You left me like a broken toy

Well, it's someone else you're taking
Someone else you're playing to
Honey, though I'm aching
Know just what I have to do
If I can't have you when I'm waking
I'll go to sleep and dream I'm with you
That's right

[Chorus]
Oh take me, take me
Take me to the dreamers' ball
I'll be right on time and I'll dress so fine
You're gonna love me when you see me
I won't have to worry
Take me, take me
Promise not to wake me 'til it's morning
And it's all been true

[Bridge]
Right down that 42nd street
Way down, downtown dreamers' ball

[Chorus]
So take me, take me
Take me I'm your plaything now
You make my life worthwhile
With the slightest smile
Or destroy me with a barely perceptible whisper
Gently take me
Remember I'll be dreaming of my baby
At the dreamer's ball

[Outro]
So take me to the dreamer's ball

[Verse 1]
Love of my life, you've hurt me
You've broken my heart, and now you leave me

[Pre-Chorus]
Love of my life, can't you see?

[Chorus]
Bring it back, bring it back, don't take it away from me
Because you don't know what it means to me

[Verse 2]
Love of my life, don't leave me
You've taken my love, and now desert me

[Pre-Chorus]
Love of my life, can't you see?

[Chorus]
Bring it back, bring it back, don't take it away from me
Because you don't know what it means to me

[Bridge]
You will remember, when this is blown over
And everything's all by the way
When I grow older, I will be there at your side
To remind you how I still love you (I still love you)

[Chorus]
Back, hurry back, please bring it back home to me
Because you don't know what it means to me

[Outro]
Love of my life
Love of my life
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
In the year of '39 assembled here the Volunteers
In the days when lands were few
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
Sweetest sight ever seen
And the night followed day and the story tellers say
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day sailed across the milky seas
Ne'er looked back, never feared, never cried

[Chorus]
Don't you hear my call though you're many years away?
Don't you hear me calling you?
Write your letters in the sand for the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew

[Verse 2]
In the year of '39 came a ship in from the blue
The volunteers came home that day
And they bring good news of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavily weigh
For the Earth is old and grey, little darlin', wellaway
But my love, this cannot be
For so many years are gone though I'm older but a year
Your mother's eyes from your eyes cry to me

[Chorus]
Don't you hear my call though you're many years away?
Don't you hear me calling you?
Write your letters in the sand for the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew

[Outro]
Don't you hear my call though you're many years away?
Don't you hear me calling you?
All your letters in the sand cannot heal me like your hand
For my life, still ahead, pity me

[Verse 1]
I was told a million times of all the troubles in my way
Mind you grow a little wiser, little better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers and I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started, bread and butter for a smile
Well I sold a million mirrors in a shop in Alley Way
But I never saw my face in any window any day
Now they say your folks are telling you to be a superstar
But I tell you just be satisfied and stay right where you are

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive (Yeah)
Keep yourself alive (Ooh)
It'll take you all your time and your money
But honey, you'll survive

[Verse 2]
Well I've loved a million women in a belladonnic haze
And I ate a million dinners brought to me on silver trays
Give me everything I need to feed my body and my soul
And I'll grow a little bigger, maybe that can be my goal
I was told a million times of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying and get better every day
But if I crossed a million rivers, and I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started, same as when I started

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive (Come on)
Keep yourself alive (Ooh)
It'll take you all your time and your money
Honey, you'll survive (Shake)

[Interlude]
Ow!

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive (Woah)
Keep yourself alive (Aww)
It'll take you all your time and your money
To keep me satisfied

[Bridge]
Do you think you're better every day?
No, I just think I'm two steps nearer to my grave

[Chorus]
Keep yourself alive (Come on)
Keep yourself alive
You take your time and take my money
Keep yourself alive

[Outro]
Keep yourself alive (Come on)
Keep yourself alive
All you people
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive (Come on, come on)
Keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and money
To keep me satisfied
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people
Keep yourself alive
Take you all your time and money, honey
You will survive
Keep you satisfied
Keep yourself alive

[Intro]
Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time
I feel alive
And the world, I'll turn it inside out, yeah
I'm floating around in ecstasy, so (Don't stop me now)
(Don't stop me) 'Cause I'm havin' a good time, havin' a good time

[Verse 1]
I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky
Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity
I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go, go, go, there's no stopping me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man outta you

[Chorus]
(Don't stop me now)
I'm having such a good time, I'm having a ball

If you wanna have a good time, just give me a call
(Don't stop me now) 'Cause I'm having a good time
(Don't stop me now) Yes, I'm having a good time
I don't wanna stop at all, yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars on a collision course
I am a satellite, I'm out of control
I'm a sex machine ready to reload
Like an atom bomb about to, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, explode!

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you

[Bridge]
(Don't stop me, don't stop me, don't stop me) Hey, hey, hey

Let loose, honey, all right

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit, hey
Travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man outta you (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
(Don't stop me now)
I'm having such a good time, I'm having a ball
(Don't stop me now)
If you wanna have a good time, just give me a call (Ooh, alright)
(Don't stop me now) 'Cause I'm having a good time (Yeah, yeah)
(Don't stop me now) Yes, I'm having a good time
I don't wanna stop at all

[Verse 1]
Sammy was low, just watching the show
Over and over again
Knew it was time, he'd made up his mind
To leave his dead life behind
His boss said to him, "Boy, you'd better begin
To get those crazy notions right out of your head
Sammy, who do you think that you are?
You should've been sweeping up the Emerald Bar"

[Chorus]
Spread your wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Pull yourself together 'cause you know you should do better
That's because you're a free man

[Bridge]
He spends his evenings alone in his hotel room
Keeping his thoughts to himself, he'd be leaving soon
Wishing he was miles and miles away
Nothing in this world, nothing would make him stay

[Verse 2]
Since he was small, had no luck at all
Nothing came easy to him
Now it was time, he'd made up his mind
"This could be my last chance"
His boss said to him, "Now listen, boy! You're always dreaming
You've got no real ambition, you won't get very far
Sammy boy, don't you know who you are?
Why can't you be happy at the Emerald Bar?"

[Chorus]
So honey, spread your wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Pull yourself together
'Cause you know you should do better
That's because you're a free man

[Outro]
Come on, honey, fly with me

[Verse 1]
Happy little day, Jimmy went away
Met his little Jenny on a public holiday
A happy pair they made, so decorously laid
'Neath the gay illuminations all along the promenade

[Chorus 1]
"It's so good to know there's still a little magic in the air
I'll weave my spell"

[Verse 2]
"Jenny will you stay, tarry with me pray
Nothing 'ere need come between us
Tell me love, what do you say?"
"Oh no, I must away, to my Mum in disarray
If my mother should discover how I spent my holiday

[Chorus 2]
It would be of small avail to talk of magic in the air
I'll say farewell"

[Bridge]
O Rock of Ages, do not crumble, love is breathing still
O Lady Moon, shine down a little people magic if you will

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Jenny pines away, writes a letter everyday
We must ever be together, nothing can my love erase
Oh no I'm compromised, I must apologize
If my lady should discover how I spent my holidays

[Intro]
Ibrahim, Ibrahim
Ibrahim
Allah, Allah
Allah, Allah we'll pray for you, hey!

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Never, never, never, never let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

[Verse 4]
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here

[Outro]
(Ooh)
(Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows

[Verse 1]

Kicking your can all over the place, singing

[Chorus]
We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you

Get your party gown, get your pigtail down
Get your heart beating baby
Got my timing right, got my act all tight
It's gotta be tonight, my little school babe

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Your momma says you don't and your daddy says you won't
And I'm boiling up inside
There is no way I'm gonna lose out this time
Oh, no

[Chorus 1]
Tie your mother down, tie your mother down
Lock your daddy out of doors, I don't need him nosing around
Tie your mother down, tie your mother down
Give me all your love tonight

[Verse 2]
"You're such a dirty louse, go get out of my house"
That's all I ever get from your
Your family ties, in fact, I don't think I ever heard
A single little civil word from those guys

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But you know I don't give a light, I'm gonna make out all right
I've got a sweetheart in hand to put a stop to all that
Snipin' and grousin' goin' on all night

[Chorus 2]
Tie your mother down, tie your mother down
Send your little brother swimming with a brick, that's alright
Tie your mother down, tie your mother down
Or you ain't no friend of mine

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Your mommy and your daddy are gonna plague me till I die
They can't understand it, I'm just a peace loving guy

[Chorus 3]
Tie your mother down, tie your mother down
Get that big big big big big big daddy out the door
Tie your mother down, yeah, tie your mother down
Give me all your love tonight
All your love tonight

[Outro]
Give me every inch of your love
All your love tonight, yeah
All your love
Tonight

[Verse 1]
Well you're just 17 and all you want to do is disappear
You know what I mean there's a lot of space between your ears
The way that you touch don't feel nothing

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, it was the DNA
Hey, hey, hey, hey, that made me this way
Do you know, do you know, do you know just how I feel?
Do you know, do you know, do you know just how I feel?

[Chorus]
Sheer heart attack
Sheer heart attack
Real cardiac
I feel so inar-inar-inar-inar-inar-inar-inar-inarticulate

[Verse 2]
Gotta feeling, gotta feeling, gotta feeling, like I'm paralyzed
It ain't no, it ain't no, it ain't no, it ain't no surprise
Turn on the TV let it drip right down in your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, hey, hey, hey, it was the DNA
Hey, hey, hey, hey, that made me this way
Do you know, do you know, do you know just how I feel?
Do you know, do you know, do you know just how I feel?

Do you know, do you know, do you know just how I feel?

[Chorus]
Sheer heart attack
Sheer heart attack
Real cardiac

[Verse 1]
I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through
(And I need to go on and on, and on, and on)

[Chorus]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
Of the world

[Verse 2]
I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune and everything that goes with it
I thank you all
But it's been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race
And I ain't gonna lose
(And I need just go on and on, and on, and on)

[Chorus]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
Of the world

[Outro]
We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end, oh
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions...

'Cause I'm burnin' up on you (Hey)
In control of what I do
And I love the way you move (Hey, go)
We'll get the heat and the thrill
Gives you more than any pill
Never runnin' out of juice (Woo)
When it's only me and you
When it's only me and you (Hey)
I guess we're ready for the summer (Ooh, ooh)
You got me, you got me losin' all my cool (Hey)
I guess we're ready for the summer (Ooh, ooh)
You got me, you got me losin' all my cool

[Verse 1]
If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time

[Pre-Chorus]
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (You're the moonlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating

[Verse 2]
I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

[Pre-Chorus]
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (You're the moonlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating

[Post-Chorus]
You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm levitating (Woo)
You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Woo)

[Bridge]
My love is like a rocket, watch it blast off
And I'm feeling so electric, dance my ass off
And even if I wanted to, I can't stop
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My love is like a rocket, watch it blast off
And I'm feeling so electric, dance my ass off
And even if I wanted to, I can't stop
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading

[Chorus]
I got you (Yeah), moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night (All night), come on, dance with me
I'm levitating (Woo)

[Post-Chorus]
You can fly away with me tonight (Tonight)
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Take you for a ride)
I'm levitating (Woo)
You can fly away with me tonight (Tonight)
You can fly away with me tonight
Baby, let me take you for a ride
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Let me take you for a ride)

[Chorus]
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight (You are my starlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me (Come on, dance with me)
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (You're the moonlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating

[Verse 1]
Somewhere in the middle, I
Think I lied a little, I
I said if we took it there, I wasn't gonna change
But that went out the window, yeah (Gonna break, gonna break)

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that I seem a little stressed out
But you're here now, and you're turning me on
I wanna feel a different kinda tension
Yeah, you guessed it, the kind that's fun
Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
When my mind is runnin' wild
Could you help me slow it down?

[Chorus]
Put my mind at ease
Pretty please
I need your hands on me
Sweet relief
Pretty please

[Verse 2]
Exactly where I want me, yeah
Underneath your body, yeah
If we take it further, I swear I ain't gonna break
So, baby, come try me
Baby, come find me
Baby, don't wind me up

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that I seem a little stressed out
But you're here now, and you're turning me on
I wanna feel a different kinda tension
Yeah, you guessed it, the kind that's fun
Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
When my mind is runnin' wild
Could you help me slow it down?

[Chorus]
Put my mind at ease
Pretty please
I need your hands on me
Sweet relief
Pretty
Put my mind at ease
Trickle down my spine
Oh, you look so pretty, please
Every single night, I need your hands on me
When your kisses climb
Oh, you give me sweet relief
Made me feel so pretty
Would you help me out, please?

[Break]
Pretty
Pretty
Pretty
Pretty

[Pre-Chorus]
Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
When my mind is runnin' wild
Could you help me slow it down?

[Chorus]
Put my mind at ease
Trickle down my spine
Oh, you look so pretty, please
Every single night, I need your hands on me
When your kisses climb
Oh, you give me sweet relief
Made me feel so pretty
Would you help me out, please?

[Outro]
Pretty please

[Verse 1]
Pocketful of honey and I'm ready to go
No, I ain't got no money, but I'm letting you know
That I'ma love you like a fool
Breathe you in till I hallucinate (Mmm)
Body make you silly, make you do what I want
Oh baby, I can make it pretty, I could string you along
But I'ma love you like a fool
Breathe you in till I hallucinate (Mmm)

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I couldn't live without your touch
No, I could never have too much
I'll breathe you in forever and ever
Hallucinate

[Chorus]
I hallucinate when you call my name
Got stars in my eyes
And they don't fade when you come my way
I'm losing my mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
Mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
I hallucinate when you call my name
Got stars in my

[Verse 2]
Put you in my hall of fame, middle of the wall
Yeah, you're my one, my favourite, my ride or die, oh
Yeah, I'ma love you like a fool
Breathe you in till I hallucinate (Mmm)

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I couldn't live without your touch
No, I could never have too much

Hallucinate

[Chorus]
I hallucinate when you call my name
Got stars in my eyes
And they don't fade when you come my way
I'm losing my mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
Mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
I hallucinate when you call my name
Got stars in my

[Bridge]
Wanna be right where you are
Let's go dancing in the dark
Don't wait, you can push to start, lose control
Kill me slowly with your kiss
Wrap me 'round your fingertips
Damn, I need another hit
(Make me lose my mind)

[Chorus]
I hallucinate when you call my name
Got stars in my eyes
And they don't fade when you come my way
I'm losing my mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
Mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
I hallucinate when you call my name
Got stars in my

[Intro: Take A Daytrip]
(Hey!)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, let's get to the point here
You love to disappoint me, don't ya?
You tell me what I want, but ain't no follow through
You don't follow through, no
But if you only knew me
The way you know my body, baby
Then I think maybe we could probably see this through
We could make it through, but

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist

[Chorus]
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed

[Post-Chorus]
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed

[Verse 2]
I dedicate this verse to (Verse to)
All that good pipe in the moonlight
In the long nights where we did everything but talk it through
That's what we do, yeah (Oh)
You always let me down, boy (Oh, oh)
But when you're going down, I get so up (So up)
Don't know if I can find someone who do me like you do

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist (Ah-ha)

[Chorus]
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please (Please), come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed

[Post-Chorus]
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed (That's what makes us)
It's bad (Oh-oh)
We drive each other mad (Oh-oh)
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed (That's what)

[Bridge]
(Ah)
Yeah, we don't know how to talk (Mmm)
But damn, we know how to fuck

[Chorus]
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad (Ah)
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head (Messing with my head)
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please (Oh, please), come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed (That's what makes us good in bed)

[Post-Chorus]
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed (That's what makes us)
It's bad (Mmm)
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed

[Verse 1]
It's second nature to walk home before the sun goes down
And put your keys between your knuckles when there's boys around
Isn't it funny how we laugh it off to hide our fear
When there's nothing funny here? (Ah)
Sick intuition that they taught us, so we won't freak out
We hide our figures, doing anything to shut their mouths
We smile away to ease the tension so it don't go south
But there's nothing funny now (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
When will we stop saying things
'Cause they're all listening?
No, the kids ain't alright
Oh, and they do what they see
'Cause it's all on TV
Oh, the kids ain't alright

[Chorus]
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women

[Verse 2]
I'm sure if there's something that I can't find the words to say
I know that there will be a man around to save the day
And that was sarcasm, in case you needed it mansplained
I should've stuck to ballet (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
When will we stop saying things
'Cause they're all listening?
No, the kids ain't alright
Oh, and they do what they see
'Cause it's all on TV
Oh, the kids ain't alright

[Chorus]
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women

[Bridge]
If you're offended by this song
You're clearly doing something wrong
If you're offended by this song
Then you're probably saying
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women

[Pre-Chorus]
When will we stop saying things
'Cause they're all listening?
No, the kids ain't alright
Oh, and they do what they see
'Cause it's all on TV
Oh, the kids ain't alright

[Chorus]
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones, you better watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

This old engine
Makes it on time
Leaves Central Station
At quarter to nine
Hits river junction
At seventeen to
At quarter to ten
You know it's traveling again

Driving that train
High on cocaine
Casey Jones, you better
Watch your speed
Trouble ahead
Trouble behind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind
Trouble ahead
A lady in red
Take my advice
You'd be better off dead
Switch-man sleeping
Train hundred and two
Is on the wrong track
And headed for you

Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones, you better watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind

[guitar solo]

Trouble with you is
The trouble with me
Got two good eyes
But we still don't see
Come round the bend
You know it's the end
The fireman screams and
The engine just gleams

Driving that train, high on cocaine
Casey Jones, you better watch your speed
Trouble ahead, trouble behind
And you know that notion just crossed my mind
And you know that notion
Just crossed my mind

[Verse 1]
She had an horror of rooms, she was tired, you can't hide beat
When I looked in her eyes, they were blue, nobody home
She could've been a killer if she didn't walk the way she do
She opened strange doors we'd never close again

[Pre-Chorus]
She began to wail jealousy's scream
Waiting at the lights, know what I mean?

[Chorus]
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keeps me running, running scared
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keeps me running, running scared
She 

[?]

[Verse 2]
She asked me to stay, and I stole her room
She asked for my love, and I gave her a dangerous mind
Now she's stupid in the street and she can't socialise
Well, I love the little girl and I'll love her till the day she dies

[Pre-Chorus]
She wails Jimmy's guitar sound, jealousy's scream
Waiting at the lights, know what I mean?

[Chorus]
It was
Scary monsters, super creeps
Keeps me running, running scared
Scary monsters and super creeps
Keeps me running, running scared
She 

[?]

[Chorus]
It was
Scary monsters and super creeps
Keeps me running, running scared
Scary monsters and super creeps
Keeps me running, running scared
She 

[?]

Aaaah 

[repeat]

[Verse 1]
Met you in the dark and look how far it got us
Bawling in your arms, a camera was recording
Laughter from the patio, we were keepin' quiet (All this hiding out)
Everything you said makes sense, but I can't say "Goodbye" yet

[Chorus]
In the end, I believe in something I can't see
In the end, I believe in something I can't see

[Verse 2]
Sleep an hour, right up to Sunday
Pull out the webcam, show off my body
I tried to lay low, right below light strobes
I want some touch from someone I don't know
Throw another dollar at a bodybuilder, on me
He's on me
Wonderful, the sun is comin' up now on me
On me

[Chorus]
In the end, I believe in something I can't see
In the end, I believe in something I can't see

[Outro]
I believe in something I can't see
I believe in something I can't see, woah
Only time I find slumber
When it is you I am under

[Chorus]
You walked all this way to show me signs
It was a hawkshaw song stuck in my mind
I turned my back for a second, I don't know why
Now you're a thousand miles out of California

[Verse 1]
Double pierce the ears, take a stab at it
Take a stab at it, let's try to make this happen
Double pierce the ears, take a stab at it
Take a stab at it, let's try to make this happen, yeah

[Chorus]
You walked all this way to show me signs
It was a hawkshaw song stuck in my mind
I turned my back for a second, I don't know why
Now you're a thousand miles out of California

[Verse 2]
Rinse your hair in the faucet
I watch you do your thing through the screen, shine, my lip glossing
Nobody knows we've been talkin'
I had a couple boys, I met you, so I lost them
You're so awesome, yeah

[Outro]
(See me out your window) I'm tryna get to know you, boy
(See me out your window) I'm tryna get to know you, boy
(See me out your window) I'm tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'
(See me out your window) Are you paranoid?
And no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no

[Verse 1]
Our heads connected, I got the message
You had your hands around my skull
Gave into ashes, passed up the acid
I look up to you when I'm below

[Chorus]
Why don't you turn me around?
Why don't you turn me around?
Why don't you turn me around?
(Oh-oh, oh, yeah) (Oh, yeah)
(Oh, ooh)

[Verse 2]
Draw on the pages, I won't erase it
I want your mark on me, eternal
I cast a shadow and I stand above you
It's all I ever wanted, a turn

[Chorus]
Why don't you turn me around?
Why don't you turn me around?
Why don't you turn me around?
(Oh-oh, oh, yeah)
(Oh, ooh)

[Bridge]
What's so wrong with wanting more?
Rollin' on the hardwood floor (Yeah-yeah, yeah)
Show me what it's like below
I'll be where the herons go
(Oh, yeah, oh, yeah)

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
It was seven or so 'cause the daylight was over
You got out of the robe and into the water
We're too familiar, we're too tethered
What comes after? What comes after?

[Chorus]
If there's nothing else 'round the corner
If there's nothing else 'round the corner
We can meet up right where we left off
If there's nothing else 'round the corner
If there's nothing else 'round the corner
If there's nothing else 'round the corner

[Post-Chorus]
Throw a tee off me, show skin, surely
Thought we were evergreen, now we're just on fire
I won't know free 'til he holds me
And I don't feel pleasure when I'm up inside

[Verse 2]
Leave fast as I can, stayin' back could be bad (I lose sleep)
Thought I wanted you back, I wrestle with that, oh (I lose sleep)
I don't know where you are, I don't know if it's bad
No answer
What comes after? What comes after?

[Chorus]
If there's nothing else 'round the corner
If there's nothing else 'round the corner
We can meet up right where we left off
If there's nothing else 'round the corner
If there's nothing else 'round the corner
If there's nothing else 'round the corner

[Bridge]
If there's nothing else right here
If there's nothing left to give
We can meet up right where we left
If there's nothing else 'round the corner
If there's nothing else 'round the corner

[Post-Chorus]
Throw a tee off me, show skin, surely
Thought we were evergreen, now we're just on fire
I won't know free 'til he holds me
And I don't feel pleasure when I'm up inside
Throw a tee off me, show skin, surely
Thought we were evergreen, now we're just on fire
I won't know free 'til he holds me
And I don't feel pleasure when I'm up inside (Go)

[Verse 1]
Basically an atheist, he's all that I believe in right now
The torch is out, I'm begging for the torture now
Half-a-stoner, practically an adolescent, insert industrial sounds

[Pre-Chorus]
Ever since Jerusalem, had a change of heart
You went back to Genesis, found God, found God

[Chorus]
But not the one you were looking for
Not the one you were looking for
Not the one you were looking for
Am I the one you were looking for?
Am I the one you were looking for?

[Verse 2]
Erasing my intolerance to nicotine and you are quite the opposite
Lace it with what you offered me (Ooh)
Cured from the ivy, yeah (Yeah)
Roses on loan (Seein' double)
Laid on a throne (Peripheral)
This is on the radio (Hold me tightly)
Say your name out loud
That's faith, that's fate (Now)

[Pre-Chorus]
Ever since Jerusalem, had a change of heart
You went back to Genesis, found God, found God

[Chorus]
Not the one you were looking for
Not the one you were looking for
Not the one you were looking for
Am I the one you were looking for?
Am I the one you were looking for?

[Outro]
Heaven's in the room (Heaven's in the room)
Heaven's in the room (Heaven's in the room)
Heaven's in the room (Heaven's in the room)
Heaven made the rules
Heaven's in the room (Heaven's in the room, shine like light)
Heaven's in the room (Heaven's in the room, shine like light)
Heaven's in the room (Heaven's in the room)
Heaven made the rules

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I watch you drive from the backseat
And I let you have your way
Switch sides with me, I got you on the way home
And you can play the radio
Reminding me to tell you something (Something)
I can't remember what you said
See you looking out the window (Window)
I wonder what you think about

[Refrain]
You would comb my hair, never let me down
Always let the tears run out, wonder what you'd tell me now
'Cause I need a friend who could have my back
When the lightning comes and I catch on fire

[Verse 2]
Return to where we were on the weekend
And you pull up to my yard
From paper to vaporize, let the smoke out
I can feel it in my heart
Imagine if it wasn't magic (Oh)
My back is on the bedroom floor
I like it when I hear you breathin' (Oh)
Reminds me that I'm not alone

[Refrain]
All my idols dead, when I have no one
I look to you for advice, what to do with my life
Half of who I am isn't all my fault
So it feels good knowing that I got somebody

[Outro]
(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
(He)
(He)

[Verse 1]
Speeding with no hesitation
Crushed up the pills that you had
Just like the matches you're burning (You can call on me)
To see if it all falls down

[Chorus]
Why do you leave yourself, leave yourself, leave yourself alone?
Why don't you ask for help when you're needing someone?
I'm giving everything to get to you, I'm knocking at your door
I'm knocking at your door
If only you would let me in

[Bridge]
Brother, you can lay your head
You can lay your head on my shoulder
I see that you, you try your best
To be someone that you don't wanna
You know, you know
You can call on me
You know, you know

[Chorus]
Why do you leave yourself, leave yourself, leave yourself alone?
Why don't you ask for help when you're needing someone?
I'm giving everything to get to you, I'm knocking at your door
I'm knocking at your door
If only you would let me in

[Outro]
(Woo, woah, woo, woah)
(Woo, woah, oh)
(Woo, woah, woo, woah)
(Woo, woah, oh)
(Woo, woah, woo, woah)
(Woo, woah, oh)
(Woo, woah, woo, woah)
(Woo, woah, oh)
You are so quiet, I wonder if you cry yourself to sleep
There is a light within your eyes, if only you could see

[Chorus]
Father, father
Come home, come home, come home
Come home, come home, come home
My arms are here
My arms are here for you

[Verse 1]
You took me fishing when I was eight
Went to June Lake, came face-to-face
With my future and a deer in the woods
Those times, so gone, so good, yeah
Those times, so gone, so good, oh-oh (So good)

[Refrain]
I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel
I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel like that

[Chorus]
Father, father
Come home, come home, come home
Come home, come home, come home
My arms are here
My arms are here for you

[Verse 2]
I thought I was separate from nature
Now I know otherwise
I might live long enough to see myself
Dying without a child, I
I see myself in you, I (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I see myself in you
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Refrain]
I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel
I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel like that, oh-oh

[Refrain]
I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel
I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel like that
Talk to me

[Refrain]
I never want to feel like that (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I never want to feel like that (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I never want to feel like that (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I never want to feel (Yeah-yeah)
I never want to feel like that (Yeah-yeah)
I never want to feel like that, oh-oh

[Outro]
I'll wake up, I'm sorry, memorize, apologize
It's alright, yeah, that's how this goes
I read that somewhere, something you wrote me
Years ago
If you look deeper, see my face through the speakers
"It's magic," that's what you said
Remember when I left you crying?
Years ago

[Verse 1]
Dreamin' of David
It's all in his honor
I don't want to die a sudden death
It's making me wonder
It's making me feel like I came down on love (I heard him say)
Tell me your problems, honor
(I'm trying, I'm trying hard)

[Chorus]
How dare you cross my mind that way?
Making me feel lots of things, I can't explain
Making me feel lots of things, I can't explain
Making me feel lots of things
I just want you to hold me forever (Mmm, mmm)

[Verse 2]
We're at an altar (My feet are tired from running so fast, oh)
I'm in your strong arms
The beauty of it all, super real
I stay on your good side (Oh, oh)
Maybe someday we'll have it all (Defeat in my head, I heard him say)
Stuck on eternal honor (Yeah, I'm trying, I'm trying hard)

[Chorus]
How dare you cross my mind that way?
Making me feel lots of things, I can't explain
Making me feel lots of things, I can't explain (It's all in my head, yeah)
Making me feel lots of things
I just want you to hold me forever (Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?)

[Outro]
I'll keep a copy of the pictures
Remembrance of my sisters
I can see the light now
I'm overgrown but not so broken
So now I'll say what I have spoken
I command the choir
It's unrequited, I don't fight it
No blood on my hands
No blood on my hands
No blood on my hands
That's how I like it
That's how I like it

[Verse 1]
Now that he has no sense of destination
Now he's running for the love of speed
When the child goes bad, it's no cause for celebration
Like Jimmy Dean, he don't talk back to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Failures as fathers
Mothers to chaos
No baby, no baby, no baby, no

[Chorus]
Hello humans, can you feel me thinking?
I assume you're seeing everything I'm thinking
Hello humans, nothing starts tomorrow
I'm the baby now

[Refrain]
Baby Universe
Baby Universe
Baby Universal

[Verse 2]
A speck of dust just settled in my eye
It doesn't matter, I've seen everything anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
Failures as fathers
Mothers to chaos
No baby, no baby, no baby, no

[Chorus]
Hello humans, can you feel me thinking?
I assume you're seeing everything I'm thinking
Hello humans, nothing starts tomorrow
I'm the baby now

[Refrain]
Baby Universe
Baby Universe
Baby Universal
Baby Universe
Baby Universe
Baby Universal
Oh, I should've been listening
To every word you said
Oh, what have I been missing
Wishing, wishing I was dead

Oh, I don't mean to be so disturbing
So far from home
Oh, what have I been learning
By being all alone

Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing is gonna tear you apart
Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing is gonna tear you apart

Oh, when we were younger
Sleep while I'm awake
I was trying to keep the door locked
I realized, well, that's a mistake
'Cuz every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing is gonna tear you apart
Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing is gonna tear you apart

Every single thing that you do
Seems so much better than I can do

Oh I should have been listening
To every word you said

Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing is gonna tear you apart
Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing is gonna tear you apart

Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing is gonna tear me apart
Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing just tears me apart
Well find a way regardless
To make some sense out of this mess
Well, It's a test, but I believe
A kiss is all we need
All the above for being in love
Shouldn't that alone be enough
Oh, It's tough when loves a weed
It grows inside of me

Nothings ever gonna stand in my
Nothings ever gonna stand in my
Nothings ever gonna stand in my way again

Waste the days, waste the nights
Try to downplay being uptight
Oh, you're right, but I believe
A kiss is all we need

Nothings ever gonna stand in my
Nothings ever gonna stand in my
Nothings ever gonna stand in my way again
A watch that ticks is wrapped around my wrist
(Oh no)
I'm a bomb regardless
(Oh) I'm a bomb regardless
(Oh) I'm a bomb regardless
(Oh) I'm a bomb regardless
(Oh)

Well find a way
Well find a way
Well find a way

Nothings ever gonna stand in my
Nothings ever gonna stand in my
Nothings ever gonna stand in my way again

Nothings ever gonna stand in my
Nothings ever gonna stand in my
Nothings ever gonna stand in my way again
She's a jar
With a heavy lid
My pop quiz kid
A sleepy kisser
A pretty war
With feelings hid
She begs me not to miss her

She says "forever"
To light a fuse
We could use
A handful of wheel
And a day off
On a bruised road
However you might feel
Tonight is real

When I forget how to talk I sing
Won't you please
Bring that flash to shine
And turn my eyes red
Unless they close
When you click
And my face gets sick
Stuck
Like a question unposed
Just climb aboard
The tracks of the train's arm
In my fragile family tree
And watch me floating inches above
The people under me

Please beware the quiet front yard
I warned you
Before there were water skies
I warned you not to drive
Dry your eyes
You poor devil

Are there really ones like these?
The ones I dream
Float like leaves
And freeze to spread skeleton wings
I passed through before I knew you

I believe it's just because
Daddy's payday was not enough
Oh, I believe it's all because
Daddy's payday was not enough

Just climb aboard
The tracks of the train's arm
In my fragile family tree
And watch me floating inches above
The people under me
She's a jar
With a heavy lid
My pop quiz kid
A sleepy kisser
A pretty war
With feelings hid
You know she begs me not to hit her
I dreamed about killing you again last night
And it felt alright to me
Dying on the banks of Embarcadero skies
I sat and watched you bleed

Buried you alive in a fireworks display
Raining down on me
You cold, hot blood ran away from me
To the sea

I painted my name on the back of a leaf
And I watched it float away
The hope I had in a notebook full of white, dry pages
Was all I tried to save

But the wind blew me back via Chicago
In the middle of the night
And all without fight
At the crush of veils and starlight

I know I'll make it back
One of these days and turn on your TV
To watch a man with a face like mine
Being chased down a busy street
When he gets caught, I won't get up
And I won't go to sleep
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Via Chicago

Where the cups are cracked and hooked
Above the sink they make me think
Crumbling ladder tears don't fall
They shine down your shoulders

And crawling is screw faster lash
I blow it with kisses
I rest my head on a pillowy star
And a cracked door moon
That says I haven't gone too far

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Via Chicago

Searching for a home
Searching for a home
Searching for a home
Via Chicago

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
The way things go
You get so low
Struggle to find your skin
Hey ho
Look out below
Your prayers will never be answered again

Phones still ring
And singers sing
Speakers are speaking in code
What now
Well anyhow
Our prayers will never be answered again

You know it's all beginning
(It's all beginning)
To feel like It's ending
(Feels like It's ending)
No loves as random
As God's love
I can't stand it
I can't stand it
The way things get
You get so high
Funny how we make new friends
Oh hey ho
I gotta go
My prayers will never be answered again

You know It's all beginning
(it's all beginning)
To feel like It's ending
(Feels like It's ending)
No loves as random
As God's love
I can't stand it
I can't stand it

Speakers speaking
Speakers speaking
Speaking in code

Speakers speaking
Speakers speaking
Speaking in code

You know It's all beginning
(it's all beginning)
To feel like pretending
(To feel like pretending)
No loves as random
As my love
I can't stand it
I can't stand it
Your prayers will never be answered again
Your prayers will never be answered again
Your prayers will never be answered again
Your prayers will never be answered again
There's an airline plane
Flies to heaven everyday
Past the pearly gates

If you want to ride this train
Have your ticket in your hand
Before it is too late

If the world looks wrong
And your money's spent and gone
And your friend has turned away

You can get away to heaven
On this aeroplane
Just bow your head and pray

Them's got ears, let them hear
Them's got eyes, let them see
Turn your eyes to the lord of the skies

Take this airline plane
It'll take you home again
To your home behind the skies
Well a lot of people guess
Some say no and some say yes
Will it take some and leave some behind?

But you will surely know
When to the airport go
To leave this world behind

Oh a lot of speakers speak
A lot of preachers preach
When you lay their salary on the line

You can hold your head and pray
It's the only earthly way
You can fly to heaven on time
Fly to heaven on time

Them's got ears, let them hear
Them's got eyes, let them see
Turn your eyes to the lord of the skies

Take that airline plane
It'll take you home again
To your home behind the skies

Your ticket you obtain
On this heavenly airline plane
You leave your sins behind
You've got to take this flight
It may be daytime, might be night
But you can't see your way if you're blind

Them's got ears, let them hear
Them's got eyes, let them see
Turn your eyes to the lord of the skies

Take that airline plane
It'll take you home again
To your home behind the skies
His goal in life was to be an echo
Riding alone, town after town, toll after toll
A fixed bayonet through the great southwest to forget her

She appears in his dreams
But in his car and in his arms a dream could mean anything
A cheap sunset on a television set could upset her
But he never could

His goal had become to be an echo
The type of sound that floats around and then back down
Like a feather
And in the deep chrome canyons and the loudest Manhattans
No one could hear him
Or anything

So he slept on a mountain
Sleeping bag underneath the stars, he would lie awake and count them
And the gray fountain spray of the great Milky Way would never let him
Die alone
Remember to remember me
Standing still in your past
Floating fast like a hummingbird

Remember to remember me
Standing still in your past
Floating fast like a hummingbird
A hummingbird
A hummingbird

A hummingbird
A hummingbird
Like a hummingbird
Hummingbird
Spiders are singing in the salty breeze
Spiders are filling out tax returns
Spinning out webs of deductions and melodies
On a private beach in Michigan

Why can't they wish their kisses good
Why do they miss when their kisses should
Fly like winging birds fighting for the keys
On a private beach in Michigan

This recent rash of kidsmoke
All these telescopic poems
It’s good to be alone

Why can't they say what they want
Why can't they just say what they mean
Come clean, listen and talk
Hello private callers, IDs blocked

The sun will rise, we’ll climb into cars
The future has a valley and a shortcut around
Who will wear the crown of drowning award
Hold a private light on a Michigan shore
You fool me with a kiss of kidsmoke
From a microscopic home
It's good to be alone

I'll be in my bed
You can be the stone
That raises from the dead
And carries us all home

There's no blood on my hands
I just do as I am told
When the devil came
He was not red
He was chrome, and he said

Come with me
You must go
So I went
Where everything was clean
So precise and towering

I was welcomed
With open arms
I received so much help in every way
I felt no fear
I felt no fear

The air was crisp
Like sunny late winter days
A springtime yawning high in the haze
And I felt like I belonged
Come with me
Come with me
Come with me
Come with me
Come with me
Come with me
Come with me
Come with me
When I sat down on the bed next to you
You started to cry
I said, maybe if I leave, you'll want me
To come back home
Or maybe all you mean, is leave me alone
At least that's what you said

You're irresistible when you get mad
Isn't it sad, I'm immune
I thought it was cute
For you to kiss my purple black eye
Even though I caught it from you
I still think we're serious
At least that's what you said

[Chorus]
Bitch, I'm...
Bitch, I'ma ball and dunk on whoever
Bitch, I'm, bitch, I'ma ball and...
Bitch, I'ma ball and dunk on whoever
I feel just like Russell Westbrook
Bitch, I'ma ball and dunk on whoever

Bitch, I'm a dog, I turn to a werewolf

Fresh out the pad, boy, bitch, I'm a hot boy
Red ass dot, boy, duh-duh-duh-dot boy

Shoot out like cowboys, Dak Prescott, boy
Percs get popped, boy, yes I'm a hostage
Xanny get popped too, that's for my conscience
Addy get popped too, now I'm a zombie
Muscle relaxant, that's for my posture
I'ma do acid, now I'm obnoxious
Sip cotton candy, pop Oxycontin
Hold you for ransom, now you the hostage
Call up your family, give 'em the options
Tell 'em to cash it, put 'em in boxes
Do not deal with 12 'cause you dealin' with monsters
If everything fail, then we killin' your mama
We all go to Hell but right now we on fire
I'm talkin' that shit, yeah
And I'm walkin' that shit like a dog in this bitch
That's your dawg, he a bitch, yeah

Squeeze your heat 'til it squish, then I wash and not rinse
Give your daughter a kiss, then we slaughter that bitch

[Chorus]
Bitch, I'ma ball and dunk on whoever
Bitch, I'm, bitch, I'ma ball and...
Bitch, I'ma ball and dunk on whoever
I feel just like Russell Westbrook

Hello
Hello, hello
Alright, Isaac and Laurie, what's happening?
I remember where we met, we was in Lidl
I thought it was Aldi
It was, you're right, it was Aldi
We had a little bit of a dispute over the last the last vegan stollen
Yeah? That is what happened
That is what happened, I thought so
Who's your favorite band member?
Yeah, definitely you, mate
Is it? (Yeah) Do you mean that?
Yeah, hundred percent
Can I tell that to Murdoc and Noodle?
'Cause I think Noodle's is hanging out for you sayin' her
But I don't know, I'll chat with her, I'm savin' it
I forgot to ask, do you support a football team?
Uhm, yeah, Chelsea
Ooh, how do you feel about, Zaha
Eh, mixed emotions
On one coat I'm alright, the second coat, I'm not

[Spoken Word: 2-D & slowthai]
Hello, how are you doin'?
How are you doing? I'm good, what's happenin'?
What'd you get for Christmas?
You said Father Christmas might not bring you things because you hadn't been a hundred percent good
Yeah, he just brought men a good item, you know what I mean
Really, ah, well, um, I got a Louis Farreux tee shirt, and that was sweet actually
Ah, bet, he's the boy
"Momentary Bliss," ah, mate, what a tune
You know when you're doing some cooking or something
And you got the fan on
And then you turn the fan off and it, ah, all quiet
Like, that to me, is momentary bliss
What do you think momentary bliss is?
It's about false idols and people who are not in control of their own destiny
And they lay their destiny to other people (Right)
And hold themselves to an industry that castrates the business
Sweet

[Intro]
Uh, uh
See, we done masterminded all this shit, you know what I'm sayin'? We know exactly how we gon' do what we gon' do, this shit, you know what I'm sayin'? This all a part of staying on top of your game, you dig? You know what I'm sayin'? Don't be these others niggas, they come out,  whatever whatever, whatever, you know what I'm sayin', they doing their thing, but you know what I'm sayin', can you maintain your shit? That's the question
Uh, uh

[Verse 1]
If Peter Piper pecked 'em, I bet you Biggie bust 'em
He probably tried to fuck him, I told him not to trust him
Lyrically I dust 'em off like Pledge
Hit hard like sledge-hammers
Bitch with that platinum grammar
I am a diamond cluster hustler, queen bitch, supreme bitch
Kill a nigga for my nigga by any means bitch, murder scene bitch
Clean bitch, disease-free bitch, check it
I write a rhyme, melt in your mouth like M&M's
Roll with the M.A.F.I.A., remember them?
Tell 'em when I used to mess with gentlemen, straight up apostles
Now strictly niggas that jostle
Kill a nigga for the figure, how you figure?
Your cheddar would be better
Beretta inside of Beretta, nobody do it better
Bet I wet ya like hurricanes and typhoons
Got buffoons eating my pussy while I watch cartoons
Sleep 'til noon, rap Pam Grier's here
Baby drinkers beware, mostly Dolce wear
Frank kill niggas' wives for one point five
While you struggle and strive, we pick which Benz to drive
The M.A.F.I.A., you wanna be 'em
Most of y'all niggas can't eat without per diem
I'm rich, I'ma stay that bitch

[Verse 2]
Uhh, who you loving? Who you wanna be hugging?
Roll with niggas that be thugging, bugging
In the Tunnel & Esso's
Sipping espresso, Cappuccino with Nino
On a mission for the lucci creno
I used to wear Moschino, but every bitch got it
Now I rock colorful minks because my pockets stay knotted
C-note after C-note, Frank Boat hold fifteen
Plus the caterer, you think you greater, uh
You niggas got some audacity
You sold a million now you half of me
Get off my dick, kick it bitch
Check my pitch, authentic persona
And I'll still stick your Moms for her stocks and bonds
I got that bomb ass cock, a good-ass shock
With hardcore flows to keep a nigga dick rock
Sipping Zinfandel, up in Chippendales
Shopping Bloomingdale's for Prada bags
Female Don Dada has no problems splitting cream with my team
Shit's straight like 9:15, y'nahmean?
Cruise the diamond district with my biscuit
Flossing my Rolex wrist shit
I kick shit, like a nigga do
Pull a trigger too

[Intro: Prince Paul]
Alrighty
Prince Paul
Uh-ah

[Chorus: 2-D]
You can freak me out, you can throw me in the lion pit
You can boil my hands and tell me I'm not here
I'm a mad Pac-Man livin' in a levelled world
Everywhere I go, I don't know where I am

[Verse 1: 2-D]
You can call me crack, you can call me mad and psycho
You can load my head, and send me into bathing light
Everybody knows, when I was sad, I fell for you
Everywhere I go, no stressin' out, no stressin' out
No stressin' out, no stressin' out, stressin' out

[Chorus: 2-D]
You can hide your head, you can throw me in the lime pit
You can boil my days and tell me I'm not blue
Everybody knows, when I was sad, I fell for you
Everywhere I go, I don't know where I am

[Break: 2-D]
Stressin' out, stressin' out, stressin' out, stressin' out
Stressin' out, stressin' out, don't stress it out, don't stress it out
Don't stress it out, don't stress it out, don't stress it out, don't stress it out
Stressin' out, stressin' out, stressin' out

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Uh, how can I trust truth?
Uh, when I ain't got nothin' to sell
I shattered my thoughts to get out my shell
Uh, why would I hold my tongue to tuck in my tales?
Ayy, can't dream if my ego is broke, nah
The joke's to try to find the answer to nope (Uh)
My type of drive, you can't buy this shit
You got a heart but it don't beat like this
I had a spark through my mind went trip
Create the wave so the vibe all mix

[Break: 2-D & ScHoolboy Q]
(I'm a mad Pac-Man) Suu
(Livin' in a levelled world)

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Yo, I been at the top of the top, fell from the ceiling before, I fell
'Cause I needed to grow, Bruce Lee, with the glow, uh
Walk on the edge, fuck trying to dream in the bed
‘Fore I die on these meds, nigga gon' die in the feds
‘Fore I make it to jail, I'll probably put one in the head
Fuck the judge and prosecutor for hanging me dead
Plus thirty and still movin', I’m closer to live, right? Closer to live, right?
All the trauma from past never taught me to fear heights
Normal to fly now, can't be stuck in the rear lights
Take flight, the life gon' bloom for the black knight
Keep a peace like Buddas, got the whole hood boomin'
I’m like a Crip high student, you on your ass, stuck stupid
You makin' weed look bad, I'll ride the beat, won't crash
I had to fill my bag, I had to hide my stash
You know the cop's lights flash, I had to clear my dash
I represent my flag, I gave the hood my last, every food crumb in it
I had to change my image, the brain don't got limits
You think a mil’ mean winning, pigs out here skinning
His soul ain't authentic, you died and still ain’t livin'
Lyrics from Snippets

[Verse 1]
Lady in blue
What are you looking for?
What do you search for in these walls
Lady in blue
Do you find comfort in
All of these souls within these walls

[Chorus]
Maybe you wander searching for love
And maybe you wander 'cause that’s not enough
Oh lady in blue
I wanna know you

[Verse 2]
Do you ever get lonely up there, talking to yourself
I can only imagine
Do you ever get tired of being always by yourself
I can only imagine
Imagine that

[Chorus]
And maybe you wander searching for love
And maybe you wander 'cause that's not enough
Oh lady in blue
I wanna know you

[Verse 3]
Lady in blue crying softly
Doesn’t notice me as I walk by
Lady in blue turns a corner
And then she is gone with no goodbye

[Outro]
Maybe she's gone until dinnertime
Maybe she's gone for good
Maybe she won't come back until next year

Maybe the lady in the blue chiffon
Finally got what she always wanted
And maybe she'll never come back here

Oh lady in blue just disappeared

[Intro: XXXTENTACION]
The brains will start to abandon the religions
And believe in themselves
And the new world order will start
Drop that motherfucker

[Verse 1: XXXTENTACION]
Narcissistic, insufficient, deadweight, I've been searchin' (Ayy)
Lack of coexistin', just don't seem to work with other bitches (No)
That's when black and white, when dark at night, that's when I do my searchin' (Ayy)
And the Anti-Christ is in my mind, the evolutions lurkin' (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I got voices in my head, wild horses in my head
Runnin' around, horse playin'
Breakin' pots up in my head, waking corpses in my head
And they was better off dead
Runnin' faucets in my head, stompin', marchin' in my head
Sun is scorchin' in my head
Archie Bunker's in my head, talkin' bunkers in my head
Willy Wonka's in my head
All this junk is in my head, then it sunk into my head
Little monkeys in my head
Goin' bananas in my head, shootin' cannons in my head
Hittin' targets in my head
Playin' pianos in my head, keyboards, organs in my head
Smash guitars in my head
Fast cars in my head, with loud ass horns in my head
Horns stickin' out head

[Chorus: Lil Wayne with XXXTENTACION]
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head (Yeah, yeah)
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
All these voices in my head
They're committin' arson in my head
Real wars up in my head, crash courses in my head
Fightin' forces in my head, white noises soundin' red
All these voices in my head, all these thoughts up in my head
Like a spark plug in my head, like a torch up in my head
Ain't no shotguns in my head, all these sharks up in my head
All these sharks need to be fed (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 4: XXXTENTACION, Lil Wayne, XXXTENTACION & Lil Wayne]
I behead a motherfucker for his contacts (Behead a mothafucka)
Take the body where the others can't see (Can't see)
Seen the devil in my eyes without no contacts
My eyes are blacker than the bottom of the sea, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Lil Wayne, XXXTENTACION, Lil Wayne & XXXTENTACION]
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head (The brains will start to abandon the religions)
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head (And believe in themselves)
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head (And the new world order will start)
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head (Yeah, yeah)
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head
I can't, I can't get the fuck out my head

[Intro]
Check

[Verse 1]
Mahogany dashboard, I do the dash, boy
Gas to the floor, I'm pressin' fast forward, I race a NASCAR
Transport just what you asked for
Don't ask me what I asked for if you can't answer
Now who them Xans for?
I'll pop DANs for muscle relaxation, I'm a patient
Pick up the pace when I feel too adjacent to who I'm racing
Yeah, I'm spacin', I'm spacin' out
Oh, you faded? I'm faded out
Oh, you made it? I made it out
But you shady like 8 Mile
8 Ball from Orange Mound, letdown, I lay her down
Like an eagle, she spread it out, ate it out, yeah, I ate it out
I'm a Libra, I weigh it out
Hope the reaper don't take me out
I'm too eager to wait it out
Stuck the heater in Satan's mouth
Pray polices don't raid the house
Pay my taxes and baby moms
Ain't no cappin', don't play around
Hate me back then, they hate me now
In my lap is your face, I got napkins to waste
I got mansions with gates, feel like I'm NASA with space
Don't feel like answerin' my phone, I feel like thrashin' today
I put my ratchet on safe, and I feel actually safe
Catchin' spasms and aches, from all the hands I done shaked
And all the cash I done counted and all the blunts I done rolled up
I stunt when I rolled up
With a bad bitch sittin' in the front with her nose up
You know what's in my soda
And your trap house closin', your glass house broken
And my madhouse open and my lighthouse glowin'

[Chorus]
Mahogany dashboard, do the dash, boy
Mahogany dashboard, do the dash, boy
Mahogany handle on the gun in my hand, boy
Brains all over my mahogany dashboard

[Verse 2]
Mahogany dashboard, I do the dash, boy
I think in my backyard, I need an airport
Mahogany sand, boy, I start a sand storm
Mahogany skin, touch me, I cut your hands off
Mahogany door handle to match the floor panel
Mahogany sand, mahogany Dior sandals
Mahogany dash, slime, I do the dash, slime
Sit the coke on the glass, slime, she snort a flat line
Good times, no hard times, uh-oh, it's that time
We at war, I check my Chopard for the exact time
Bang, bang, brrat time, I'm reppin' Fab Five
Flag high, red, red, red, bloody vampire
Plug was a fucking Arabi, it's no cap, slime
Judge gave me time, I did that time like nap time
Mahogany skateboard, I parked the Wraith for it
I kick, push straight forward, I hear Lupe flowin'
Under the skully, these bright mahogany dreads showin'
Let's get in bed and break these mahogany headboards
Oh, woah, mahogany, yeah, woah

[Chorus]
Mahogany dashboard, I do the dash, boy
Mahogany dashboard, I do the dash, boy
Mahogany dashboard, I do the dash, boy
Uh, yeah, I do the dash, boy
Mahogany handle on the gun in my hand, boy
Brains all over my mahogany dashboard

[Outro]
Louis mahogany bags for the bag boys
Louis, Louis mahogany bags for the bag boys
Soon as we land, on mahogany sand
Maho-mahogany sand
Louis mahogany bags for the bag boys
Soon as we land, on mahogany sand
I ain't arguin', I'm sayin'
Ooh, mahogany

[Verse 1]
What's good, brother?
Beat 'round the bush and I'ma come around with a bush cutter and look for you
You niggas talkin' too much shit
I'm about to find a good plumber
Y'all lil' niggas is some foot soldiers, I'm a foot fungus
You dead, brother
I ain't a killer, but don't push me, like a red button
The gun headbutt you like "Bang, bang, bang, bang"
'Til your heart stop drummin'
I shoot you while the sun don't shine, this a hot summer
But fall dawg, I knock a wall off with this sawed-off
This bitch sound like a hard cough
I'm a wizard with this mothafucka like I went to Hogwarts
Cut the hog head and the tail off
I'm the nigga bitches put a spell on
And once it wear off, then, bitch, don't touch me like a airball
Say slime, I done ate slime, money tall like 8'9"
But I'm still starvin' like a skinny model in LA slime, that plate mine
Hooded up like Trayvon, no FaceTime
I don't FaceTime with my new thang
New Tang clan, like Raekwon, I'm stupid, nigga
Dumb, deaf, brazy, cray-cray, blind
But I still see in the dark, nigga
Dark nigga, Akon
I'm on my shit like maggots
And they then they grow and they fly
Got real bitches with fake asses
With real views and fake eyes
It's stupid, I'm stupid
I'm out of my Kufi, narcotic abuser
No needles, 'cause my pockets balloonin'
Your partners is poodles
Your bears is cubs, your crocodile's toothless
Titty-fuck your baby mama
She breastfeed your child while I do it, I'm stupid

[Bridge]
Your crocodile's toothless
Titty-fuck your baby mama
She breastfeed your child while I do it, I looped it
(Mama Mia)

[Verse 2]
I'm out of my Tunechi, I'm mindin' my Tunechi
I'm shinin' my Uzi
They find 'em, I lose 'em, I'm hidin' out
Hopin' I don't smell like all these fuckin' vaginas I'm douchin'
Droppin' these jewels, it's precious like I'm droppin' my jewelry
I'm out of my Gucci, you not on my Gucci, that's not an exclusive
Designers, excuse me, massagers masseuse me
Oops, I mean masseuses massage me, I'm gruesome, I'm grimey
Turn you and lil' mami, to tuna salami
You pukin', she vomit, that's beautiful science
That's Tune in a Masi', that's who in a Hyundai
You stupid or drowsy? I pew in the 'Gatti
Pew, pew and I got 'em, pew, pew and I got 'em
Lil' Tunechi a shotta
Come through with my shottas, catch you and your thotta
Turn a nigga noodle to nada
Find it amusin', it's like it's a movie
This life is a movie, you died in the movie, I write and produce it
I cried as I view it, I'm lyin', I'm goofin', I'm tyin' my nooses
Lightin' my fluids, ignitin' influence, wait
Retire like Ewings, I'm high like I flew in
And my wife lookin' Jewish, wait
My money look Arabic, blunt lookin' Cuban
My eyes look Korean, the coke look Peruvian, wait
She European and she from Aruba, she from the States
Ass overseas, pussy foreign food, we overate
We throw them B's up high as the moon, suwu in space
I come from Mars, but I act like I'm from the Planet of the Apes
Mansion with a gate with some nice landscapes, the Atlantic across the way
Don't ask me what I make, I'ma be answerin' all day
Got a hammock, I'ma lay with a naked bitch with just a bandana on her face
And I just psstt, took off, errr- and landed on her face
I cannonballed her face
Fuck her to some Diana Ross and faint
Damn, I lost the faith
Don't judge me, I took the stand and fought the case
You can't avoid the Drac'
Drip Bayless, I'm feelin' Shannon Sharpe today
Big rocks in my mouth, can't remember how many asteroids I ate
Your pastor called today, I told him that your casket on the way
Now pass the phone to bae
I'm bringin' a pole, you dancin' on his grave
He faker than the lashes on his babe, I'm like lashes on a slave
I'm ashin' on his head
He ain't got no credit and his Apple Card is dead
What's in your wallet?

[Outro]
(Mama Mia)
Funeral

Woke up on islands, OD's and violence
Roses with no thorns (Huh, huh, huh, huh, yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
I just woke up with some new tattoos (Yeah, yeah)
I just woke up next to "Who is you and you and you?"
Got the groupie blue, woopty woo, hooty hoo

No mansion or no pool (Yeah, yeah)
I woke up and I screamed...

[Intro]
(Chill Stump on the beat)

[Verse 1]
Ooh, I got a plus sized model
But she my lil' mama
I make her bust it open for me like a piñata
And as the world turned, she was my spin doctor
'Cause when I was down, you all got lost on me like Bin Laden
I know that times changed, I don't think I've changed
I changed my mind a bunch of times, but that's just mind games
Baby, stop playin' with me
Do I look like I'm playin' with you?
I was runnin' from myself, and that's just who I ran into
Closed my eyes last night and had a dream I was dyin'
When I woke up, I was surprised, and I hate surprises
I hate to love, they love to hate, but when it's all synchronizin'
It feel just like the flames have died up in this cold state of mind
Promethazine tranquilizers as I say my goodbyes
Paid them no mind, and as I wait for my receipt
I just got my face tatted and it felt orgasming
I got on a straightjacket, then it must be fashion week
I just look like this, ho, don't be comparin' me
Shit is so embarrassing, low-key flattering
They'd rather battle royale, way before they battle me
Long live my skateboard and rest in peace to Adam Z
Motherfucker, stop playin' with me

[Chorus]
Stop playin' with me, bitch, stop playin' with me
Stop playin' with me, bitch, it's been a long time
For a long time
Time sure flies but it's on a long flight
No I don't need air time 'cause I got hang time
You think it's play time? Well bitch, it's game time
And you gon' stop playin' with me
Stop playin' with me, bitch, stop playin' with me

[Verse 2]
Ooh, I've been feelin' like a killer since the diapers
I've been feelin' like a hitter since the minors
Sticky icky like a itsy bitsy spider
They say to be or not to be, bitch, I'm indecisive
I'm in the buildin' like the interior designer
You in your feelings like a bitch when she get her cycle
Ain't that a bitch, ain't that a bitch? I'm yellin', "Please don't wife her"
Dwayne Carter, niggas wanna be the DC sniper
Well, fuck it, I'm thuggin' on the low, I'm ballin' on the high
I'm fuckin' on the floor, she can crawl but can't hide
I'm Bloodin' with my bros, goin' hard with my slimes
It ain't nothin' to a GOAT but the roar of a lion
Jungle book, ho, it's another book show
No car keys needed, button push, go
We gon' ghost ride in the whip, then she believe in ghosts
I'ma snowplow on that bitch until she freezin' cold
She gon' slope style on the dick until she eat the snow
Put my foot down in this bitch, these niggas twinkle toes
Nigga, sit down, you a bitch, I heard your seat unfold
Way up in the nosebleeds, hold your head back, squeeze your nose

[Outro]
Nigga, stop playin' with me
Stop playing with me
It's been a long time, a long time
Long, long time since she loved me long time
Told her stop playin' with me
Stop playin' with me
No, I don't need air time 'cause I got hang time
You think it's play time? Well then it's game time
You gon' stop playin' with me
Stop playin' with me, bitch, stop playin' with me
Stop playin' with me, bitch
Yes, I've been on time, for a long time
And time sure flies, but it's on a long flight
And you gon' stop playin' with me, yeah

Grind it like Ariana, grind it like marijuana

Grrr

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I did not come here to see who was litty
That stamp on the kilos say "key to the city"
Put some on my thumb and then I make her lick it
She can't feel her tongue, well, bitch, I beg to differ
I smoke gasoline and I sip down some lean
My whole tangerine on this dick, trampoline
I chop you up, they call them amputees
I spit these facts, they call me fax machine

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I drop a four in this, I'm feelin' glorious
Gun on Big Pun, and my clip on Notorious
Bitch, I'm the man, no, the Mandalorian
I'm in a DeLorean, nigga, I'm floorin' it
I got my whore in it, that bitch a foreigner
Pourin' her heart out, I'm just ignorin' her
I let my hair down, I'm finna go throw her
And bury myself in that pussy, no coroner
I can't smoke Reggie, I be too edgy
My bitch a veggie, bitch, I'm a legend
Pull out my flag, and these niggas start pledgin'
Go pull up whenever, we ain't gotta schedule it
Boy, I'm a president, presidential Rollie
Bezel it heavily, inspect it carefully
I'm smokin' like I'm in the Netherlands
Like I'm a hippie that's stuck in the 70s
You with your buddies, I'm with my bloodies
And this ain't no flag, lil' nigga, this rugby
Duct-tape that nigga up until he a mummy
Then put him in a freezer until we get hungry

[Chorus: Lil Wayne & O.T. Genasis]
Huh, I keep my foot on gas, bitch

[Post-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Oh, I keep my foot on gas, bitch

But you know karma is a bitch just like you a bitch
Walked in the pet store said, "Get me a cobra"
Gotta keep your friends close, enemies closer
You know wifey from Australia, she said, "Cheers, mate"
Then we toast and see how you niggas' tears taste
Mix the soda and codeine, that's a mixtape
And if you hatin', come and say it to my dick face
But who the fuck want war? No one so far
Two cups, no straw, bustdown Chopard
Smoke medicinal 'cause I'm sick

It's my shit, nigga, smell that
I'm in the Koenigsegg, nigga, spell that

Talkin' shit and it taste like apples
Fuck rappers

[Chorus]
Now who gon' pop me?

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I don't trust nobody, not my lovers, not my friends
I don't make no promises, 'cause I know just how they'll end
I don't trust nobody, I don't need nobody else
And as messed up as it sounds, I don't even trust myself

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
If you out there in the streets and you've been lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, "I said I've been lookin' for me"
I've been lookin' for some love, but it ain't lookin' for me
That's why she bite her tongue when she tell me that pussy for me
I've been lookin' at the cross and it just look like a "T"
Two fingers, I keep 'em crossed, I can't be lookin' for peace
I've been lookin' at the stars and they don't glisten for me
I've been lookin' in the mirror, he don't listen to me, sheesh

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine & Lil Wayne]
If I die before I wake (Yeah)
Pray the Lord, my soul to take (Uh)
I lost count of my mistakes (Shit)
At least I learned along the way

[Chorus: Adam Levine, Lil Wayne, Adam Levine & Lil Wayne]
And I don't trust nobody (Nobody), not my lovers, not my friends (Nobody)
I don't make no promises (No promises), 'cause I know just how they'll end
And I don't trust nobody, I don't need nobody else (Nobody else)
And as messed up as it sounds, I don't even trust myself

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
If you out there in the streets and you've been lookin' for me
You gon' find a bunch of motherfuckers lookin' like me
I ain't ever lookin' back because the light always green
Safe to say I lost my way, but I never lost the lead
Safe to say I lost the brakes, but I never lost the speed
Wakey-wake, I lost some sleep, but I never lost the dream
If you out there at the crossroads lookin' for me
You gon' find me with my eyes closed lookin' for grief

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine, Lil Wayne, Adam Levine & Lil Wayne]
If I die before I wake (Yeah)
Pray the Lord, my soul to take (Uh)
I lost count of my mistakes
At least I learned along the way

[Chorus: Adam Levine & Lil Wayne]
I don't trust nobody, not my lovers, not my friends
I don't make no promises, 'cause I know just how they'll end
I don't trust nobody, I don't need nobody else
And as messed up as it sounds, I don't even trust myself, yeah

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
If you out there in the streets and you've been lookin' for me
When you find me, tell me, "I said I've been lookin' for me," fuck

Tell her to drive it to Africa (Damn)
This how a rich nigga take the trash out, but I'm not a janitor (Nah)

Get a rush when the egg sizzle
Pocket full of dead people
She mine, I don't share people
If the feds watch me, they can see how many times I done fed people (Tell 'em)
I hit, but I can't date you, baby
You on the side like a baked potato
You look crazy, I don't wanna change you
If you a car, I would candy paint you
That's a bar, that's an indicator
Deep breath, hyperventilation
Shorty gon' share that throat (Throat)
She got the best, let's vote (Vote), yeah

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And nigga, if you know your ho, that ho a ho
You know that ho gon' ho for sure, for sure, for sure
She up next and she finna blow, still the same ho
Kissing on you with the same throat
If you know you know, that ho a ho
That ho is still gon' ho for sure, for sure, for sure
She up next and she finna blow, she still the same ho
Kissing on you with the same throat

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Shorty not a thief, but she steal a show, but she still a ho
I'ma need a million dollar bitch and a million more
She know I'm a million dollar nigga with a million hoes
Chillin' way up in my condominium on the millionth floor
She said that these niggas broke, they make her sick, she healing slow
She said she sick and tired of being sick and tired like Mystikal
I got cash from years ago, I ball 'til my Achilles tore
You say you stackin' money to the roof, lil' boy, your ceilings low
She been catching feelings though
She been all in my business like Siri though
I don't believe in no miracles
She swallow my bacterials
I fucked your ho, conduct your ho
If you don't believe it, there's video
That ain't your ho, that was your ho
She just a ho, she been a ho

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And nigga, if you know your ho, that ho a ho
You know that ho gon' ho for sure, for sure, for sure
She up next and she finna blow, still the same ho
Kissing on you with the same throat
If you know you know, that ho a ho
That ho is still gon' ho for sure, for sure, for sure
She up next and she finna blow, she still the same ho
Kissing on you with the same throat

[Outro: Lil Wayne & 2 Chainz]
Lil' mama not no thief (She ain't no thief), not no thief
Steal a show, but she still a ho (Yeah), yeah
She steal a show, but she still a ho (Yeah)
I just might buy her a Acura (Uh)
Tell her to drive it to Africa (What?)

[Intro]
No cap

[Chorus]
She love me or leave me
I gave her a reason, she don't want a reason
She don't wanna see me, she don't wan' believe me
I tell her that's cold, I'm already freezin', my heart ain't even beatin'
Just talked to the reaper, he put me on speaker, he told me to keep ya

[Verse 1]
I know I ain't perfect
Got shit I need to work on, a nigga been workin'
I know you uncertain
You ride for me and I drive you crazy and I know I've been swervin'
I know you've been nervous, I know I've been reckless
And now you all heartless, and now it's all worthless
I don't deserve ya, you don't deserve this
I turned a blessing into a burden
I'm really sorry, I know it don't fix it
A nigga been wishin' that I could reverse it
I know it don't help it, I know I look selfish
And looks are deceiving, but you lookin' further
And you lookin' past me, I'm just a has-been
How did this happen? What is the current? Where's your endurance?
You actin' like you've never been in love, like you just a tourist
Shit was the purest 'til you got curious
You know that love don't come with insurance
I blame the jurists who put me on trial
They was sick of your smile, now we just cured 'em
That got me furious, people that knew of us
Tell me they sorry, I said that make two of us
Wonder what ruined 'em
Wonder how beautiful you look at your wedding when I'm at my funeral, goddamn

[Interlude]
(Love me or leave me)
Love me or leave me
(Let me go my own way)

[Chorus]
She love me or leave me
I gave her a reason, she don't want a reason
She don't wanna see me, she don't wan' believe me
I tell her that's cold, I'm already freezin', my heart ain't even beatin'
Just talked to the reaper, he put me on speaker, he told me to keep ya
So I tried to call, but I couldn't reach ya, you blocked my number
I feel like James Harden, you blocked my jumper, goddamn

[Verse 2]
Who you lovin', who you wanna be fuckin'?
Since it ain't me, just tell lil' homie he lucky, I'm lonely for nothing
I'm starin' at the phone and the button to call 'em to come in
I'm starin' at the walls, I been punchin' these walls, did me nothin'
I'm thinkin' 'bout the ball I've been fumblin' when stars were abundant
Then shit happened, and all of the sudden the toilet start flushing
Try to avoid the confrontin', enjoy the consumption
With outside noise and seduction, it's harder to function
Look up at the angels, they hoverin', they show me the light
They told me that I know that I'm wrong, but I don't know what's right, goddamn

[Pre-Chorus]
(Love me), you must hate me (Or leave me)
Love me or leave me
(Let me go my own way)

[Chorus]
She love me or leave me
I gave her a reason, she don't want a reason
She don't wanna see me, she don't wan' believe me
I tell her that's cold, I'm already freezin', my heart ain't even beatin'
Just talked to the reaper, he put me on speaker, he told me to keep ya
So I tried to call, but I couldn't reach ya, you blocked my number
I feel like James Harden, you blocked my jumper, goddamn, Funeral

[Intro]
Oh
This is

[Chorus]
Huh, Mama used to say this when she stand above my baby crib
Never trust nobody that could bleed for five days and live
Grandma used to say that this world gon' come to a crazy end
Monsters in my closet was the feds taking baby pics
Daddy used to look at me like, "Who the fuck this baby is?"
Uncle used to say, "Your daddy just too young to raise a kid"
Daddy used to treat my mama like they never made a kid
I'm Satan's kid, I'm Satan's kid, I'm Satan's kid (I'm Satan's kid)

[Refrain]
Uh, I know the tables turn like tornadoes turn
I know the way it turn, gotta wait your turn
Until you take your turn, fuck a wrong turn
I made the world turn, that's a turn on
I'm on every song that I turn on
I got it turnt up, got it turnt on
I'm on the turnpike, I'm 'bout to turn off
Weed loud as every siren they turn on
Bust down so bright, it's burning
These diamonds so white, they German
Your diamonds ain't right, they turning
Cocaine white as my attorney
All types of guns, no type of permits
All types of coffins, all types of gurneys
From my driveway to my front door
It has been quite a journey

[Interlude]
It has been quite a journey
From my driveway to my front door
It has been quite a journey

[Chorus]
Huh, Mama used to say this when she stand above my baby crib
Never trust nobody that could bleed for five days and live

[Verse]
Walking on water, this a new world order
These niggas out of order like a fish out of water (Huh?)
I'ma shoot the chopper like a fisheye camera
Yeah, I'ma keep shootin' 'til the bitch stop recordin'
Just don't start shootin', I don't feel like arguin'
A real sharp sharpshooter, I don't miss my target
And I don't miss my thottie, I just miss my homie
Long walk-in closet, I hope you feel like walkin'
Uh, I know the paper burn like it ought to burn
I know the paper burn for the long term
I know my big concern when I toss and turn
I know my big concern 'bout the long term
I know the paper burn like the fire burn
I know it don't burn unless I confirm
I'm 'bout to cross my heart and watch your heart burn
Crossin' me is like watching a cross burn
Swag go head to shoe (Yeah)
Bitch, I'm fresh as a designer, yeah
Started from Ragu, made it way up to lasagna, yeah
Killers come behind ya, can you say, "Murder for hire?"
Sippin' on purple papaya, gitchi ya-ya, yeah

[Chorus]
Mama used to say this when she stand above my baby crib
Never trust nobody that can bleed for five days and live
Grandma used to say that this world gon' come to a crazy end

[Verse]
Oh my God, I'm gettin' personal now
All I can see is the purplest clouds
Oh my God, I'm gettin' virtual now
I'm 'bout to sip on this syrup 'til I drown
Oh my God, I'm gettin' thirstier now
I'm ballin' way too hard on these clowns
They 'bout to give me a personal foul
I'ma thank God for my existence
I'ma thank God for my charisma
I'ma thank God that I'm in the business
And I'ma thank God I'm not in the system
I'ma thank God for the pots that I pissed in
I'ma thank God for the times I done risked it
I'ma thank God for workin' out the logistics
I'ma thank God that I'm not a statistic
All of my jewelry is fuckin' ridiculous
I cannot really be seriously serious
All of my goons take everything serious
Run in the building and kill your superiors
Killin' the staff and kill the affiliates
Smokin' this gas just like it's some helium
I see y'all ass all in my peripheral
Hop in that, hop in that like an amphibian
She workin' that ass continuous
I'm workin' my plans, ingenuous
I'm talkin' 'bout mags and millions
Mags and millions, man, ask Eminem
I got a monogamous smile
I do not know how I do how
I give all to my daughters, no doubt
It's been all about now until now
I've been keepin' it quiet but loud
I've been keepin' it private but proud
I've been treatin' the fire like flowers
I've been keepin' it silent but "Pow"
And she 'bout to twerk on the ground
Oh my God, she gettin' personal now
Oh my God, I'm 'bout to skirt on her blouse
Oh my God, she 'bout to slurp up a child (Yeah)
She 'bout to twerk on the ground
Oh my God, she gettin' personal now
Oh my God, she threw her shirt in the crowd
Oh my God, she 'bout to surf in the crowd
Pop me a Perc and I smoke me some loud
Oh my God, I'm gettin' personal now
Call up my phone and my service was down
Sorry, I ain't been on Earth in a while
Pop me a Perc and I smoke me some loud
Oh my God, I'm gettin' personal now
Call up my phone and my service was down
Sorry, I ain't been on Earth in a while
I'm 'bout to sip on this syrup 'til I drown
Oh my God, I'm gettin' thirstier now
I'm ballin' way too hard on these clowns
They 'bout to give me a personal foul, damn

[Part II]

[Intro]
Ayy, tell you what you should do, son

[Verse]
Uh, let's get personal, Percocet got me vertical
Them Uzis get so surgical, shooters, they shoot like Türkoğlu
We murder you, then bury you, dig a hole and throw dirt at you
You disappear like abracadabra, magic like 32
It is my time, and when it is, you on timeout
I'm on Cloud 9 and, nigga, you just on iCloud
I'm an icon, I shine and burn your eyes out
You on the sideline, my side bitch got a side bitch
Gotta sip slow 'case I die quick, I'm alive, bitch
Born piss poor, I'ma die rich full of my shit
Bust up in your house on some mob shit, leave no hostage
Leave you lookin' like January 2nd, July 5th
Y'all are all witnesses to my battles, I shall fight
Been through a whole lotta bullshit, still smell nice
Poverty to penitentiary straight to paradise
Took a few L's without 'em, I couldn't spell 'Life'
Airtight, vagina tight and it better smell right
Banana clip dick, banana up in her tailpipe
Big fish, nigga, killer whale, kill a bitch nigga
I'ma snap and send a pic, nigga, flick-flick, nigga
Tunechi, I pop me a Perc and I smoke me some loud
Oh my God, I'm gettin' personal now
All I could see is the purplest clouds
Oh my God, we gettin' virtual now
I'm 'bout to sip on this syrup 'til I drown
Oh my God, I'm gettin' thirstier now
I'm ballin' way too hard on these clowns
They 'bout to give me a personal foul

You could ask Chrissy Teigen, ask John Legend

[Verse 1]
She say I got a vanilla aftertaste
Cut his face, let him use his blood for his aftershave
Harrell Park, it ain't nothin' like South Park
Pistol whip you 'til you know the serial number by heart, damn
Sit the chop on top your nose, if you sneeze, I squeeze (Smoke)
Got them extra extendos, call them Eazy-Es
Uzis, .223's, TEC's, semi-automatic, reflex
Bullet ain't got no name, but these no-names ain't got no respect
Put some respect on my name, don't know where I got that from
Mad scientist in this bitch, don't even know what I'm mad for, woo
'Cause it's hard to ignore the bullshit when it can't flush, woo
Tryna dodge and duck, but you can't duck, nigga, blaow

[Chorus]

Go at my neck, I'm comin' back at your skull (Gone)
I'm comin' back with her drawers
Come back with the bag, the package and all, yeah
I put the stash in the wall
Thirty round dick, I'm jackin' it off, yeah
'Til ain't no more jacks in the cards
Aces and kings, blackest of hearts, yeah

Family man, your family involved, damn
Family tree, branches gon' fall
Actin' an ass, no actin' at all, no
All of the cameras is off
You fucked up the deal, look back at the mall, huh
We dunk on 'em, back in the form

[Intro]
Dark side, dark side, dark side
Dark side, dark side, dark side

[Verse]
We don't like these niggas, we don't fight these niggas
We "good night" these niggas, you look like these niggas
Fu-fuck it-fuck it up, fuck 'em up
Hit him up, hunt 'em down, hurry up
Shoot him up, shut him down, shut him up
Eat her out, dick her down, cuddle up
But bitches comin' 'round with the funny love
Lick me up, lick me down, done enough
Eat her up, spit her out, bubblegum
Treat her right, treat her out, trouble come
Got some cocaine and a couple blunts
It's ashes to ashes, dust to dust
.44 plastic, the rubber bust
We don't wear masks, 'cause it must be us
I got the Holy Ghost in my Backwood
On my tippytoes and them flat-foot
Bitch pigeon-toed and her cat good
I know her pussy hole like my MacBook
She Tootsie-Roll on the black wood
Get her own page in the black book
And it's startin' to feel like I'm attached to her
If it's that good, I put a stamp to her
I'm a warlord to these fuckin' boys
Double-edged sword and a bubble, boy
I just won a war in a Hummer 'fore I'm 'bout to come to yours
Lookin' for a war, I am nothin' more than somethin' more
Than much more as the punch pour
And I slunch more with my lungs sore
I smoke you and your blunt blowers
Let's get on with it, Megatron with it
Telephone like a telethon
Bitches workin' bitches like a Peloton
Finish yellow bones dizzy, very long visits
And I'm talkin' numbers, Jerry Jones digits
I'm at home sippin', and I'm gone sippin'
Got a Draco with my arm in it
Shoot you in your heart, put some charm in it
Sorry, gotta leave your mama tormented
"Bah, bah, bah" if she commented
Cops pulled up, and they vomited
I am not finished, hope they long-winded
Money long-livin' with a strong finish
Dead presidents, wasn't born with it, I'ma die with it
I'm amor with it, didn't start livin' 'til the war ended

[Chorus]
It's wartime, wartime, wartime
Y'all lil' niggas small time
All my niggas ex-cons
And we do not fuck with y'all kind
Bitch, it's wartime, wartime, wartime
Y'all lil' niggas small time
All my niggas done time
Or they doin' time, that's just lost time
It's still wartime, wartime, wartime
Dark side, dark side, dark side
Pull up, "Brrt," skrrt
Then we joyride 'til the car die

[Outro]
Bitch, it's wartime (Wartime), wartime (Wartime)
Wartime (Wartime), no talk time (No talk time)
Chalk time (Chalk time), all-time (All-time), hard time (Hard-time)
Bitch (Bitch)
Dark side (Dark side), dark side (Dark side), dark side (Dark side)
(Dark side, dark side, dark side, bitch)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a pimp under pressure, but it's necessary
Treat a bad fish better than a veterinary
Never treat a secondary sweet as February
I could turn a bestie into a adversary
I tried, no, really, really, I tried
Although I'm really, really up, I'm
Still gonna give you all my downtime
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I, I, got a lot on my mind
To my slime, don't be surprised if I cry, I cry
He say "Why?" I say "Why?"
He say "Damn, my nigga, never mind," oh no
That's why I just get high
I light one and watch time go by, go, go
Is this love, is it lust, is it drugs?
All I know is I tried
Is it love, is it lust, is it drugs?
All I know is I tried

[Verse 1]
Thought I was done tryna love
I guess I love tryna love, hey
Not so careful, but today, I just don't care
Dye my hair
We so faded, we can't make it up my stairs
We fuck right there
Not so lucky, but tonight, I just crapped out
Vegas sucks, I'm still gambling with her, no protection
Protect what?
'Cause I'm me, I'm the one she sells her soul to
That's because she knows, I don't buy dreams
I'm the one, she comes and goes
But whatever, who knows?
Nigga, not me
I'm the one she does the most
So when she do the most
At least, the most, at least
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm a pimp under pressure, but it's necessary
Treat a bad bitch better than a veterinary
Eat a bad bitch 'less she got that hairy, hairy
I could take her ex out of her vocabulary

[Chorus]
I, yeah got a lot on my mind
Tell my slime, don't be surprised if I cry, I cry
He say "Why?" I say "Why?"
He say "Damn, my nigga, never mind," oh no
That's why I just get high
I light one and watch time go by, go, go
Is this love, is it lust, is it drugs?
All I know is I tried
No, really, really, I tried
Although I'm really, really up, I'm
Still gonna give you all my downtime
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey

[Verse 2]
We ain't no junkies, but today, we're like Snow White
Whatever we like, she don't judge me
Though I may need her to be the one to give me life
'Cause I'm me, I'm the one she sells her soul to
That's because she knows, I don't buy dreams
I'm the one, she comes and goes
But whatever, who knows? Not me
I'm the one she does the most
So when she do the most
At least, the most, at least
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) Never mind

[Outro]
I, I, got a lot on my mind
To my slime, don't be surprised if I cry, I cry
He say "Why?" I say "Why?"
He say "Damn, my nigga, never mind"

That made me featherweight, so I can levitate
Into a better place, I don't care where you stay
Better, they better, but that's how you better stay, wait (Wait)
Who's that peekin' in my window, pow, nobody now (Pow)
Two, no buss downs, one bling-bling, one bling-blaow (Wow)
Just fucked my ex, don't know why, don't know how

Oh me, oh wow, baby, show me around

[Outro]
And we're out

[Intro: Future]
Put that Christian Dior on a Muslim, she feelin' like she was sinnin'
Her family lose faith in a genocide, I told 'em bring 'em all to Finland
I don't mean to admire you, just passion, I'm winnin' (D. Hill)
(Said I was in that UK, get closer to feelin' it)
Had to double back up my double-cup, yeah, yeah
You gotta put up out the city, she can't get any closer
Especially when you're driving a bandwagon after
You gotta put 'em on, she like that

[Chorus: Drake]
Ayy, I should have put you somewhere where no one could find you
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment (Woo)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Hey)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Hey)
'Cause you got desires

[Verse 1: Future]
You got that fire and I'm not a liar
You had me down on my knees everyday, had to talk to Messiah
I'm in that '81 and this that '82, this a different Ferrari, yeah
I tried to pay all of your loans off and cop you a driver, yeah
I had you stayin' too close to the city
You actin' too vulnerable livin' this life
I shoulda moved you away from Houston, before I copped you all this ice
You wanna be my number one, you're not actin' like the main thing
I let you play my number two, you barely made the section

[Chorus: Drake]
I should have put you somewhere where no one could find you (Find you)
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment (Ayy)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Hey)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Hey)
'Cause you got desires

[Chorus: Drake]
I should have put you somewhere where no one could find you
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment (Hey)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Hey)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Hey)
'Cause you got desires

[Verse 2: Future]
You should have did what you said you would'd do
You should be movin' in silence
See the type girl you hang with, the wildest
Need a better environment
I bought bags to fill up your closet
I pop tags, I know where I'm rounded
I do the dashes, get higher than the mountain
You need class to be with a celebrity
So sad, you lookin' like charity
What you wanna do? See niggas bury me?
All of my brothers are black, carry me
I can't answer you through the legacy
At the embassy speak, it was like therapy
Bought a Patek Philippe in your currency
Bitches can't keep it real with a nigga movin' so desperately
You the one that did the Twitter shit first to see how these hoes react
The only one that can make me feel some way 'cause I love you back
You wanna be my queen, niggas fuckin' on you, think I'ma take you back?
Your bags are secured at home, relax

[Chorus: Drake]
I should have put you somewhere where no one could find you
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
Katy, Texas, Dallas, Texas, you know, a different environment (Hey)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Hey)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Hey)
'Cause you got desires

[Outro: Future & Drake]
I should have put you somewhere where no one could find you
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you
California, Santa Barbara, you know, an early retirement (Oh)
'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know

[Chorus 1]
Living on the edge of night
You know the sun won't go down slow
You don't know what drug is right
Can't decide which way you want to go
I feel the way you feel
Because not so long ago
It had a hold on me
I couldn't let it go
It couldn't set me free
It wouldn't set me free
No more, no more, no more, no more

[Chorus 2]
Seemed like the easy thing
To let it go for one more day
Like singing the same old song
And twisting the words
In a different way
Where did the magic go?
I searched high and low
I can't find it no more
I can't get it back
I can't find it no more
I can't find it no more
No more, no more, no more, no more

[Chorus 3]
Searching for quality
Having to have the very best
Now scrounging for quantity
Never having time
To do the test
That's how the story goes
Can't put it down
Till the last page
You can't put it down
You can't put it down
I can't put it down, put it down

No more, no more

[Verse 1]
Awwww
I can't stand it, I know you planned it
I'm-a set it straight, this Watergate
I can't stand rockin' when I'm in here
Cause your crystal ball ain't so crystal clear
So while you sit back and wonder why
I got this 

[censored] thorn in my side
Oh my god, it's a mirage
I'm tellin' y'all, it's sabotage

[Verse 2]
So, so, so, so listen up, cause you can't say nothin'
You'll shut me down with a push of your button
But, yo, I'm out and I'm gone
I'll tell you now, I keep it on and on

[Verse 3]
Cause what you see, and what you get
And we can bet, so don't you get souped yet
Gone
I'm trying to tell you now, it's sabotage

[Pre-Chorus]
Whhhhhyyyyyy

[Chorus]
Listen all'a'y'all, it's a sabotage
Listen all'a'y'all, it's a sabotage
Listen all'a'y'all, it's a sabotage
Listen all'a'y'all

[Verse 4]
I can't stand it, I know you planned it
I'm-a set it straight, this Watergate
But I can't stand rockin' when I'm in this place
I feel disgrace you're all in my face
But make no mistakes and switch up my channel
I'm Buddy Rich when I fly off the handle
What could it be -- it's a mirage
You're scheming on a thing, that's sabotage
Aahh, can you say New York City?
Yeah, Saturday Night Live
We gonna set it off like this, y'all
Check it!
Huh

I been there, and done that
You got guns? Ayo, I got straps
Cuz there's a million people on the planet Earth
That talk that hard nonsense cause that's all they worth

I been there, and done that
You got guns? Ayo, I got straps
Cuz there's a million people on the planet Earth

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
No question, it's all about the D-O-E
So if money is the root I want the whole damn tree
Ain't tryna stick around for Illuminati
Got to buy my own island by the year 2G
Since way back, I've been collectin' my fee
With the 48 tracks and the M-I-C
Got a palace in the Hills overlookin' the sea
It's worth eight, but I only paid five point three
Worldwide, like the triple beam I slide
Listenin' to your demo in the stretch limo
Is how I ride, cartel style, vaults stacked to the max now
A million dollar smile, people wonder how
"Dre Day" every day
Trips to Montego Bay with more chips than Frito-Lay
Floss jewels and attire, ain't nothin' flyer
Straight or illegal, it's still the root of all evil, cause
I been there, and done that
You got guns? So what? I got straps
Cuz there's a million people on the planet Earth
That talk that hard nonsense cause that's all they worth

You know, I been there, and done that
You got guns? Ayo, I got straps
Cuz there's a million people on the planet Earth
That talk that hard nonsense cause that's all they worth
Yeah

[Backup singers Dr. Dre]
You know you're fading
Out of my life
Huh yeah that's right
And I think it's about time
That you leave

[Verse 2]
The young black Rockefeller
Hella Swiss and mozzarella
Pockets sweller
Gettin' money like a bank teller
Cause a fool and his dough soon split
So when you come across a fool get all that you can get
Ladies, get your paper too
Don't expect for no man to support you, keep it true
Most brothers erase those that's out for the pesos
My woman's independent, makin' dough by the caseloads
I'mma keep buildin', make a killin'
Kick back relax, and grow old with my millions
That's where it's at, you got drama, I got the gat
But we both black, so I don't wanna lay you flat
Instead let's get paper, while it's paper to get
Private jet, 600 Coupes, then I run Vettes
I'm livin' on another level that y'all ain't been yet
Spend a mill', no sweat, water the lawn with Moet
Been there, and done that
You got guns? Ayo, I got straps
Cuz there's a million people on the planet Earth
That talk that hard nonsense cause that's all they worth

Huh, I been there, and done that
You got guns? Ayo, I got straps
Cuz there's a million people on the planet Earth
That talk that hard nonsense cause that's all they worth
Yeah

[Backup singers Dr. Dre]
Gotta get that money, baby
That's right
Gotta get that cash
Dollar dollar bill, y'all
You know what I need now, baby
This is the aftermath

[Verse 3]
This is for the millionaires, throw a stack in the air
Watch brothers start plottin', honeys start to stare
Cause game is money, money is game
Broke brothers make the four-five flame with no shame
Now many people die over these dead green guys
Ignorance and greed take they ass by surprise
It's the root of all evil and sins
Yet and still it makes the world go around like my 20 inch rims
Moolah y'all, platinum plaques cover my walls
Grindin, diamonds shinin, without one flaw
Get the cash, the grass, the ass, the bounce
Luciano in all amounts, that's all that counts, cause
I been there, and done that
You got guns? Ayo, I got straps
Cuz there's a million people on the planet Earth
That talk that hard nonsense cause that's all they worth

You know I been there, and done that
You got guns? So what?  I got straps
Cuz there's a million people on the planet Earth
That talk that hard nonsense cause that's all they worth
Yeah

[Outro: Dr. Dre]
Yeah

The candlelight and you, walking softly through my door
Come on in, my sweet, how have you been?
You're so nice, but tonight, we're gonna be more than just friends

[Pre-Chorus]

[Intro]
This will get the kids goin'

[Verse 1]
Baby, can't you see I'm calling?
A guy like you should wear a warning
It's dangerous, I'm falling
There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit, baby, give me it
You're dangerous, I'm lovin' it

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?

[Chorus]
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?

[Intro]
Come on, baby
You can fuck with me

[Verse 1]
I want to kiss you in Paris
I want to hold your hand in Rome
I want to run naked in a rainstorm
Make love in a train cross-country
You put this in me
So now what, so now what?

[Chorus]
Wanting, needing, waiting
For you to justify my love
I'm open and ready
For you to justify my love
My love
Hoping, praying
For you to justify my love
My love, my love
For you to justify my love
My love, my love, my love
For you to justify my love

[Verse 2]
That’s right
What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?
Talk to me, tell me your dreams
Am I in them?
Tell me your fears
Are you scared?
Tell me your stories
I'm not afraid of who you are
We can fly!
Poor is the man
Whose pleasures depend
On the permission of another
Love me, that's right, love me
I want to be your baby

[Chorus]
Wanting, needing, waiting
For you to justify my love
My love, my love, my love
For you to justify my love
My love, my love, my love
For you to justify my love
My love, my love, my love
For you to justify my love

You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no no

To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down
(You'll never come down)

[Chorus]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

Long stem roses are the way to your heart
But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed?
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right, then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better, baby, on your own
(Baby, on your own)

[Chorus]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real
Express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, baby, baby, hey, you got to
Baby, baby, baby, baby

[Chorus]
(Baby, on your own)
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test

You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground

Make him love you 'til you can't come down

Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels

Express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not

[Bridge]
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees
So please

[Chorus]
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real
Express yourself
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not
Express yourself

[Chorus: Curtis Mayfield, Guru]
Niggas!
Niggas!
Niggas better know, I paid my dues and shit

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Back up chump, you know Biggie Smalls rips it quick
And kicks it quick; you know how black niggas get
With the hoods, fatigues with the boots with trees
Smokin weed, flippin ki's, making crazy G’s
Hitting buckshots at niggas that open spots
On the avenue--take my loot, and I'm bagging you, huh
Pimping hoes that drive Volvos and Rodeos
Flash the roll, make 'em wet in they pantyhose
Damn, a nigga’s style is unorthodox
Grip the Glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks
Just in case a nigga wanna act out
I just black out, and blow they motherfucking back out
That's a real nigga for ya

[Chorus: Curtis Mayfield, Guru]
Niggas!
Niggas!
Niggas!
Niggas better know, I paid my dues and shit

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
When we smoke spliffs, we pack four-fifths
Just in case Dread want to riff
He get a free lift to the cemetary, rough very
Not your ordinary: we watch you get buried
That's a real nigga for ya
Get mad, do a quarter, flip the script, and rip your lawyer
Spit at the DA, 'cause fuck what she say
She don't give a fuck about your ass anyway
Up north, bound first stop for the town
Of Fishkill, where the hand skills are real ill
You'll be a super Hoover doo-doo stain remover
Hahaha, yo Cheek, she like that shit, Cheek

[Chorus: Curtis Mayfield, Guru]
Niggas!
Niggas!
Niggas better know, I paid my dues and shit

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Money, hoes, and clothes
Blunt smoke coming out the nose, is all a nigga knows
Flipping on foes, putting tags on toes
Watching the stash grow, clocking the cashflow
The neighborhood gravedigger
Getting paid so much, all the bitches want to see a nigga
I guess they figure I'm paid, I want to get laid
Or since I got loot, I want to knock boots
I'd rather beat my dick than trick
And if she don’t suck, then we don’t fuck
I'd rather make a buck, drive a fat-ass truck
Grab the 9, two clips, and run amuck
Yes, flex after two or three Becks
As I wreck shit, what the fuck you expected?
A fly guy? Well fuck it, I’m the high guy
From Bed-Stuy, putting the swelling on your eye
And your nose even; when I choke ya, you stop breathing
And when Jake come, I'm leaving

[Chorus: Curtis Mayfield, Guru]
Niggas!
Niggas!
Niggas better know, I paid my dues and shit
Niggas!
Niggas!
Niggas better know, I paid my dues and shit

Gonna say somethin', say it out loud

[Outro]
Come on
Dream on, dream on

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
No matter which way it goes, y'all be the rookies, we pros
I always stay on my toes
You smell the kush on my clothes
A real boss never folds or show the cards that he holds
I'm with my squad getting stoned
Or with your broad getting dome
A couple cars, couple homes off of the bars I composed
Speaking of composure, I keep it and I keep my team closer
Niggas need to keep their mouths shut, closure
If we don't eat then what's the outcome? Vultures
A pound of weed, you'll never see me without one
Always lowkey, you hardly see me in town
But if you do I'm trying to smoke a zip if you down
We came up together but we different somehow
Think I figured it out
They don't do shit, lil niggas just running their mouth
How do I say this shit without hating?
You built your crib on weak foundation
And forgot that you gotta live in that house

[Verse 2: AD]
Paid in full like Money Mitch, got a brick to sell
Lot hated the progress, I still wish them well
That lil nigga from Compton pray for a wishing well
Now I'm menaging with SZA, drinking white zinfandel
And 

[?] but never kiss and tell
Crap table in Vegas more than a Chippendales
I hear 'em plotting, nowadays I never get compelled
Fuck your couch, I'm Rick James like it's a skit, Chappelle
Beating on the table, I'm grindin' like it's Clipse for real
I want gas rather pump, taking trips to Shell
Getting good brain, yeah that noggin could've went to Yale
Keep it silent when we beefing but that clip'll yell
Shipping KK overseas til they strip the mail
Ride Clinton presidential, could've cripped with Bill
Or get that Scott from Gil
If you know what I mean, yeah

[Part 2: NEW MAGIC WAND]

[Intro: Tyler, The Creator]
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone
New magic, new magic, new magic wand
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone
New magic, new magic, new magic wand
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone

Sometimes you gotta close a door to open a window
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, whoop!

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]

My eyes are green, I eat my veggies
I need to get her out the picture, uh
She's really messin' up my frame
She's not developed like we are

[Refrain: Tyler, The Creator]
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone

She's gonna be dead, yeah, I just got a magic wand, uh (Don't leave)
We can finally be together, together, together, baby, uh

[Bridge: Charlie Wilson & Boys II Men]

[Verse 4: Tyler, The Creator]
Take one look in the mirror, implications so clear
I live life with no fear, except for the idea
That one day you will not be here
I will not fetch the ball
My eyes are green, I eat my vegetables
But it has nothin' to do with that broad
But if it did, guarantee she'd be gone, well
I got a plan, 'bout to walk in the pen
If you can't understand, I'm a hawk
Eyes on the prize, got weight on my chest
That I need to get off
Can't be in the picture if it got no frame
Gon' let the world know 'cause I ain't got no shame
Blow the whole spot up, 'cause I
I wanna share last names, I wanna be your
Not the other one, keep it on the low
I'm in my right mind, keep it on a high
Janis Joplin spillin' feelings, now I'm out here moppin' 'em
Four on the floor, pack up your bags, we hit the store
Grab our supplies, no need for masks, bust through the door
Get the job done like retirement, I admit you look concerned, that's new magic wand

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Ooh, electrifyin'

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Thundercat]
She (Ooh, we), way outta my league, can't buy her love

Girl, don't know me, don't know enough
(Baby) (She don't know me)
Said (Ooh, we), if you don't know me, you don't know enough
(Baby) (She don't know me)

[Post-Chorus: Mac Miller & Thundercat]
Mmm, said, ooh, we (Yeah), got me sayin', "Baby" (Hell yeah)
You can drive my car, but don't drive me crazy
(Girl, you drive me wild) (Skrrt)
I know that life is hard, we dancin' on the boulevard
Girl, am I crazy? (Crazy) I must be crazy (Crazy)

[Verse: Mac Miller]
Um, yeah
Ya got trouble payin' rent now
Live in an apartment, I can take you to the penthouse (Cha-ching)
Got a step child, gone like a exile
Make me say, "Woo," every time you pull your breasts out
(She got so much love) I'm feelin' left out
(I can be your drug) When you're stressed out (Yeah)
I know you say it's true love
But why you always hit me when the check bounce?
Ooh, yeah, we in love
Tell me what I gotta do to get my dick sucked
She a pin-up, lookin' for a rich one
Need to take your ass on home
Pick ya kid up (Pick your goddamn kid up)
Yeah, hard movin' of the kick drum
You ain't have none, girl, better get some
You can talk about the universe and energy
But all you really want is a celebrity (You motherfuckin' bitch) (Bitch)
(Man, that was a little harsh, you're just lost, and I'm here to find you)

Said (Ooh, we), if you don't know me, you don't know enough
(Baby) (She don't know me)

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
Oh yeah, the God back, had the hits before they made contact
Aight bro, fuckin' with a psycho, you should stop that
Fuck rap, wall of plaques, stats leave 'em all shocked (Undeniable)
Wait for that forfeit, that's a long shot
We on top, it's a job and every day is nonstop
Been a boss, call shots, they prayin' I'ma fall off
(These motherfuckers)
Just an interview, all talk, fatality, I'ma finish you, bomb drop (Yeah)
And bitches love the kid, I make her nervous
Got her, stu-stu-stutterin', all I do is fuckin' win
Issa giant, can I fuck your shit up? 'Cause I'm wildin'
That one is a motherfuckin' bride
Better quiet down, I'm standin' on the high ground
In the music world, wide renowned
I'm makin' money while I'm lyin' down
All these motherfuckers silent now

[Chorus]
All I hear is crickets, all I hear is crickets
All I hear is crickets, all I hear is crickets

[Verse 2]
Yeah
And I piss art, comin' for whoever play me in charge
Fit inside your wallet like a motherfuckin' gift card
Everybody wanna ball and be a big star
It's interception, pick six, play the guitar
Do you wanna be the man? You could be a big shot
All you need is a plan and a little bit of dedication
I went away and kept 'em waitin'
Now it's back to record breakin' (Yeah)
It only matters if it sounds good
When it come to paper, I'ma count books
Hearin' crickets, movin' units, sellin' tickets, fuck the critics
Made it way beyond my fifteen minutes, I'm on
And I'ma put in work 'til I'm gone
Who'd of thought, millionaire off of makin' some songs
Cold motherfucker, you could feel the snow
Run your mouth, I don't hear you though

[Chorus]
All I hear is crickets, all I hear is crickets
All I hear is crickets, all I hear is crickets

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Mama, don't cry no more, I'm comin' home

[Chorus]
I'm not like you, could I be?
A lot of things that I do, I would not suggest that anybody do too
I'll carry your weight, so I don't gotta carry my own
Can you give me your problems please?
I'll take 'em with me and leave mine at home

[Verse 1]
Have you met somebody crazy as me? I'll wait, you'll see
Swear to God the studio should pay me to leave
Goddamn, I tried, I tried
Told the truth and I lied
Lord knows that I've been foolish
You mistakin' me for human one too many times, yeah
You gettin' no more emotion from me
Gimmie anybody who still believes that their dreams can come true
I guess I'll take your ignorant too, and I'll teach, and we'll see
And the rest you can keep, I don't need it

[Chorus]
I'm not like you, could I be?
A lot of things that I do, I would not suggest that anybody do too
I'll carry your weight, so I don't gotta carry my own
Said, can you give me your problems please?
So I can leave mine at home

[Verse 2]
I'll be the first one to admit, sex been kind to me
Would I give it all back for just a crack at a goodnight sleep?
You set the table for me, sorry, I can't eat
It's easy to lie, you think I got places to be
Shit, I spend so much time tryin' to relax my mind
You spend every day on your feet, why can't you see that...

[Chorus]
I'm not like you, could I be?
A lot of things that I do, I would not suggest that anybody do too
I'll carry your weight, so I don't gotta carry my own
Can you give me your problems please?
I'll take 'em with me and leave mine at home

[Outro]
Yeah
Could I be?
Said, Mama, don't cry no more, I'm comin' home

[Verse 1]
I've got the devil chillin' on my shoulder
Telling me that soon it's gonna be over
'Cause why would anybody get closer to me?
So tell me, what am I waiting for?
Do I think that there must be something more?
One year in and I'm out the door, complete

[Pre-Chorus]
If I'm honest
I've come to hate myself tonight
I do this every time

[Chorus]
Why do I keep fucking good things up?
Runnin' from the ones I love the most
Show me how to let somebody in
700 nights I've spent alone

[Post-Chorus]
I self-sabotage, I self-sabotage
I self-sabotage every little thing
Every little thing

[Verse 2]
I know that I'm hard to love
I understand that you've had enough
Round and round, the same cycle
Can make you feel like a psycho

[Pre-Chorus]
If I'm honest
I've come to hate myself tonight
I do this every time

[Chorus]
Why do I keep fucking good things up?
Runnin' from the ones I love the most
Show me how to let somebody in
700 nights I've spent alone

[Post-Chorus]
I self-sabotage, I self-sabotage
I self-sabotage every little thing
Every little thing
I self-sabotage, I self-sabotage
I self-sabotage every little thing
Every little thing

[Chorus]
Why do I keep fucking good things up?
Runnin' from the ones I love the most
Show me how to let somebody in
700 nights I've spent alone

[Post-Chorus]
I self-sabotage, I self-sabotage
I self-sabotage every little thing
Every little thing

[Intro]
(Oh yeah, oh yeah, shit, yeah, yeah)
Late night, thinkin' of shit, um (Yeah)
(Tell me why)
Tell me why, tell me why
It's so hard to say goodbyes
Tell me why, tell me why
(No, no, no, no)
Oh, shit, let's go (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye (Shit)
And when I get inside of my mind, I lose my time
Thinkin' 'bout the times we had to thinkin' 'bout the time we spent
Tell me why you left when you told me this was forever and
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye, yeah

[Verse 1]
Lost too many people to this shit, can't even speak upon this shit
I seen shit, I'm way too damn young, it shouldn't need to be like this
I swear that I'm way too damn numb to even think about this shit
But when it's late and I lay awake, I get to tweakin' in this bitch
Overthinkin', overdrinkin' Hennessy up in this bitch
And I'ma face another 'wood 'til I can't think up in this bitch
'Cause if I keep thinking 'bout our memories
Then it's gon' be in memory of me

[Chorus]
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye (Shit)
And when I get inside of my mind I lose my time
Thinkin' 'bout the times we had to thinkin' 'bout the time we spent
Tell me why you left when you told me this was forever and
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye (Shit)

[Verse 2]
I can't count all the tears I cried, so many sleepless nights
Watched all of my idols die, right in front of my eyes
She asked why my heart so cold, and I just can't even lie
I think that I'm better off, without you with me tonight
Better off alone, 'cause I won't take it well if
You come in my life, just to go like the rest did
Why the fuck does God keep testin' me?
Put my heart to bed, let it rest in pieces

[Chorus]
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye (Shit)
And when I get inside of my mind I lose my time
Thinkin' 'bout the times we had to thinkin' 'bout the time we spent
Tell me why you left when you told me this was forever and
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye, yeah

[Outro]
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye, yeah
And when I get inside of my mind I lose my time
Thinkin' 'bout the times we had to thinkin' 'bout the time we spent
Tell me why you left when you told me this was forever and
Tell me why, tell me why it's so hard to say goodbye, yeah

Lyrics From Snippet

[Verse: The Game]
...Lost a legend but Vanessa lost a husband in the dark

[Verse: Big Sean]
Fuck twenty-four Seven, I'm goin' twenty-four eight
Fuck twenty-four Seven, I'm goin' twenty-four eight
That's Magic, and he know what it took to be great
41, five rings, and it still ain't addin' up, what
Was in L.A. when it happened, Hit-Boy track it up
God send me a sign, I'm outside lookin' up

[Verse: The Game]
I was courtside when you scored 60
Now you in heaven with my nigga from the 60s
Black Mamba, neighborhood Nipsey
That's the type of love you throw and it come back like a frisbee
Kobe with the 'fro, Kobe with the lineup
Torn achilles limpin' to the free throw line, yeah
I cherished the moments I seen you go at 'Bron
But my favorite moment seein' you jumpin' in Shaq's arms, yeah
Ain't no realer than that
Turn to a blank page, Kobe could fill it with stats
As I shed tears chuggin' this Hennessy back
What you do when people die and God ain't sendin' 'em back
Question Everything

[Intro]
The beach is a good place to pick up girls because you can really see what you're getting
Most beaches are- of chicks
And they’re-and they're-and they're-and they’re-and they're-and they're-and they're-and they're
Hm, mm, mm

[Verse]
I've been moving in backward directions
During astral projections
I plaster my ass on the wall for attention
I need faster connections
Past is regret, I'd flash from the gemses
If I didn't care what my friends did
Friends that pretend, wanna end when you get bit
Get slick, get quick, wanna spend shit
Ends with a sniff or a huff or injection
I can’t handle rejection, stand my reflection
Damn, no one gets it
Should I be kind and remind that I’m weak?
So I fall more behind every week
I'm the ’shine once guys take a peek
I cry from my eyes to my feet
Stairs to the streets, to the gutters, to the sea
When I mutter in my sleep
I say, "Mother never weep"
My brother finds blood
I say, "Shut up 'fore she sees"
Another motherfucking treat
Won-wonder will she weep, won-wonder where she be
Thunder on my teeth
Spittin' natural disasters
God told me, "Cat, don't mess with the past tense"
You’re testing the masters
So guess what the fact is
My ex is a bachelor
Next, gonna get big checks from the sets
Next, from the dancers
Next, from the models
This Hennessy is cursed
Someone hexed all the bottles
Someone hexed all the bottles
I swear on my life, I always try
But in my eyes, I can fly
Sigh

[Chorus]
Better luck next time
Be-be-better luck next time
Better luck next time
Be-be-be-be-better luck next time
Better luck next time (Better luck next time)
Be-be-be-be-better luck next time
Better luck next time
Be-be-be-be-better luck next time
Better luck next time
Be-be-be-be-be-be-be—

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Some days I move like water
Some days I burn like fire
Some days I wanna push further
Some days I wanna do nothin', and

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna be the best of me
Even though sometimes we might disagree
So that I can be the best for you
That's all I wanna do

[Chorus]
I'm goin' through changes
I'm goin' through changes
Though I'm goin' through changes
Don't mean that I'll change

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I'll go to sleep early
Sometimes I can't close my eyes
Sometimes I smile like it's all good
Even though there's pain underneath it

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna be the best of me
Even though sometimes I forget to breathe
So that I can be the best for you
That's all I wanna do

[Chorus]
I be goin' through changes
I'm goin' through changes
Though I'm goin' through changes
Don't mean that I'll change
Yeah, I'm goin' through changes
I'm goin' through changes (Ooh, yes, I am)
Though I'm goin' through changes (That's right)
Don't mean that I'll change, woah

Yo, clear the way, it's some bad bitches comin' through (Sheesh)

[Chorus]
Yikes, I play tag and you it for life (Woo, life)
Yikes (Yikes), you a clown, you do it for likes
Yikes (Yikes), yes, it's tight, but it doesn't bite
Grip it right, he be like (Woo)

Bag talk
But ain't got no mouth when money bag talk, hmm
It's quiet, ain't no back talk (Grrr)
Quiet, ain't no back talk

[Chorus]
I learned how to make love from the movies
Catch me waitressin' up Ruby Tuesday’s
Says he wants to buy me and a white milkshake
I’ll serve you up a special side of heartbreak

[Verse 1]
Betty Lou’s working down at the Friendly’s
Met a millionaire while she was serving him pancakes
She served your baby a coke and went outside for a smoke
Before you kiss the alligator don’t ask to see him later

[Chorus]
I learned how to make love from the movies
Catch me waitressin' up Ruby Tuesday’s
Says he wants to buy me and a white milkshake
I’ll serve you up a special side of heartbreak

[Verse 2]
She said Lana Ray you gotta do what I say
My man’s sending his buddy Ray over your way
He knows you’re bad to the bone and that you never come home
But he saw you in a picture and he really wants to meet ya
So if you see him just do what I say
I said okay

[Chorus]
I learned how to make love from the movies
Catch me waitressin up Ruby Tuesday’s
Says he wants to buy me and a white milkshake
I’ll serve you up a special side of heartbreak

[Outro]
He’s my rodeo king and I’m his Alabama
Diamond horseshoe ring and I know how my man likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it

Yeah I can take you to mansion (Let me take you)
Remove the load from your shoulders (It's Usher babe)
Girl I can do a diamond ring, I can do a lot of things
But first can I get you home girl?
Can I? Can I get you home girl?

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Nothin' better to me I say (I say)
Than to ride on a sunny day (Uh-uh)
Pretty bitch right beside me (Yeah)
I'm ridin' clean and my nigga Ike on Camelton in a new Benz
V12 sit before it dropped and the truth is
If I were back in '95
I'd have gave my life for that ride back then
Since then I've had 10, swear to God
Never mind that, girl I see in your eyes
You wonder how It feel havin' me in your thighs
Have you spittin' on that pussy, just fit it aside
My room 8 freaks, one nigga inside
I got 'em all screamin' and hellorin'
Comin' in unison, lookin' surprised
I don't know why she surprised
'Cause when she came up in the crib it look like fantasy island
Why you think I got this big ass house? (You see)
Why you think I got this big ass bed? (You know it)
Why you think I got this big ass shower? (You see)
And Ciroc coming out of my water fountain?
Tell you some of that make your day go better
Throw a bankroll on you if you say "No, never"
She wanna eat her, she's gonna let her
Her boyfriend callin' man, he know better her
We stuck in place, I can take your place
You can just consider this a paid vacation
'Cause you work for me now and I pay daily
Your job bringin' me naked lady
And my job fuckin' till they can't take it (Take it, take it)
Then skeet on their faces
Might video tape it
But I bet it ain't gone be no shower rods in the
Places ima take ya, sorry MiMi (Faust)

[Chorus: Usher]
I can take you to Ibiza (I can take you to)
We'll be livin' in our own world (Livin' in our own world)
Yeah I can take you to the room
I can take you to the moon
But first can I get you home girl?
Yeah I can take you to mansion (Let me take you)
Remove the loads from your shoulders (It's Usher babe)
Girl I can do a diamond ring
I can do a lot of things
But first can I get you home girl?
Can I? Can I get you home girl?

[Outro: Usher]
Yeah, oh can I get your home, girl?
Can I? Can I get you home, girl?
Can I? Can I get you home, girl?
Can I?
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Can I get you home, girl?
Don't forget your home, girl

[Verse 1]
Reckoner
Can't take it with you
Dancing for your pleasure

[Verse 2]
You are not to blame for
Bittersweet distractors
Dare not speak its name

[Refrain]
Dedicated to all hu- all human beings
Lyrics from snippets

[Intro]
Tell me who you want
I'm proud of you, yeah
I'm so motherfuckin' high
(Wheezy outta here)

[Chorus]
Got a quarter pound, a AP and a necklace on me
Got a brand new Richard Millie and it's treacherous, homie
Mismatched the diamonds, yellow cross white necklace on it
Had to let her get away, she way too sexy for me
Got some pink and grey Chanels under my ankle, yeah
Creepin' in and out the house like a burglar
Having sex on a speed boat, stickin' to the G code
Gators out the swamp, call a murderer

[Verse 1]
Got my neck on froze, wrist, fingers on froze
I keep up with all my hoes and they all on coke, ayy
Short and long term goals, I completed all those
Even though I drape her down in clothes, hate to see the bitch in clothes (Goddamn)
I draped her up with clothes and I still don't like she clothed
I pressed up all my woes and they way across the globe
I do the rose gold Rolex with pink golds
Got a pink pink Molly in the bag, pink toes
I iced out all my hoes 'cause they like my neck on froze
A nigga killed my woe and my murder was spectacle
Put the four four...
We gon' pop yo' mans, leave him hot like a stove

[Bridge]
Come 

[?]

[?]
Come with me closer
I'm proud of you
I'm proud of you

[?]
No matter where you at, I'm poppin'

[Verse 2]
Princess cut diamonds on a Rolls Royce... (Woah, woah)

[Intro]
Ooh, and I can feel you
Even though I haven't touched you
Yeah, that's what love is
That's what true love is
Wouldn't want nobody else by my side
Ooh, and you can trust me
After all the lies I told you
Yeah, that's what love is
That's what true love is
Don't nobody else deserve my time

[Verse 1]
I reach out to you, but my hands can't hold enough
Enough of your greatness
You teach me patience
Like the best of our worlds collide
Never understood what it meant
It meant to submit to love
So beyond what lust is
Hey, it's a blessing that you're in my life
Make me look even better
When we shine, we shine together

[Chorus]
Yeah, that's what love is
Now, that's what love is
Don't nobody else deserve my eyes

[Verse 2]
When you demand my presence, it's hard to read the message
I stay on the defense to take away your leverage
'Til you put it in perspective
Can't help but to respect it
Oh, now I know what love is
I know what true love is
Yeah, down in my soul
Far more than you know
My self-esteem gets low
You lift it right up through the ceiling, woah

[Chorus]
Ooh, and I can feel you
Even though I haven't touched you
Yeah, that's what love is
Now, that's what love is
Wouldn't want nobody else by my side, no

[Outro]
(Oh-oh-oh, oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh)
That's what love is (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh)
That's what love is (La-la-la, la, la, la)
I appreciate you (Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh)
God bless your maker, hey-hey (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh)
That's what love is (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh)
That's what love is (La-la-la, la, la, la)
Look at this love
Intro
(Haha)
(Yeah, yeah yeah)

Verse 1 (Lizzy)
Pour me up a glass of whiskey
Refill it all the way to the top
I know that you wanna kiss me
If I let you, you could fuck me up

Pre-Chorus (Lizzy)
Day and night you get her love
Obviously you're tied up
Baby, you can use my cuffs (Cuffs, cuffs)
She's a bad bitch I agree
Jealousy looks good on me
I'll let you take it off of me
Oh, oh but

Chorus (Lizzy)
I know that you came with her
But if you'd like to leave with someone new
I could be dessert
You just say the word and I'll come through
I know you know the things I've heard
Do you wanna show me if they're true?
This shit probably hurts
Knowing that I'll never cry for you
Oh, you fell in love with me? Oops!
Hmmm
Verse 2 (Ella)
You just stare as she walks towards us
High heels and whiskey in her cup
I know that you wanna touch her
If I let you that would fuck me up

Pre-Chorus (Ella)
Night and day you get my love
Obviously it ain't enough
You know that I play it rough, whoa
I'm a bad bitch I agree
Jealousy looks good on me
I'll let you rip it off of me

Chorus (Ella)
It looks like you came with her
But if you'd like to leave with someone new
I could be dessert
You just say the word and I'll come through
I know you know the things I've heard
Do you wanna show me if they're true?
This shit would probably hurt
If I did the same damn thing to you
Oh, you fell in love with me?
Oops!
Bridge (Both)
You got attached, now you need it
Send me a text, I'll delete it
That picture I sent, you can keep it
'Cause I don't really care that much
You fuck with her and I see it
Mess with my mind for no reason
You play with knives now you're bleedin'
But I don't really care that much, whoa

Chorus (Both)
'Cause I know that you came with her
But if you'd like to leave with someone new
Go ahead and flirt (Go ahead and flirt)
Don't have to say a word, I'm watchin' you
You know I know the things you've heard
And now you realize that they're all true
Baby, it'll hurt (It'll hurt babe)
Soon you'll know the crazy shit I do

[Outro]
Oh, you fell in love with me? (Oh, you fell in love with me)
Oh, you fell in love with me? (Oh, you fell in love)
Oh, you fell in love with me?
Oops

So baby, keep the door unlocked (Woo)
Wait, slow it down, down (Yeah)

Makin' sure I drive you ready

[Pre-Chorus]
Ride me all night, night
Make you feel so good
If I swing by, swing by
All the things we would do

[Chorus]
Baby, won't you let me swing by?
Got me on this 3AM drive
Wanna be with you all night
So I pull up like skrrt, I pull up like skrrt (I pull up like skrrt)
Pull up like skrrt, oh yeah-yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Got me on this 3AM drive, hey-hey-hey
Got me on this 3AM drive

[Verse 2]
I pull up like skrrt
Take off my shirt, lift up her skirt
Then I go on down
It's what you prefer, it's what you deserve, yeah
Ooh, you hotter than summer
Screams louder than the thunder
Stamina like a marathon runner, yeah, yeah
Said you need a real one, real one
Well, you got a real one, yeah, yeah, yeah
Rev the engine up
Baby, make you growl
Once I pull up, once I pull up
You know what's up
Can't get enough, not gassin' you up

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I'ma let you drive, drive

[Verse 3]
Girl, you know I put you first
Been through the worst
Hurt your feelings
Now I'ma listen, I'ma let it sink in
And the Lord as my witness, I'ma start facin' my fears
With this heartbreak, yeah
Oh, no
Never thought, never thought I'll ever grow, oh-oh-oh
And I love it when you give it to me, nice and slow
Already said I'm sorry, said my bad
And it troubles me not to think about the past

[Chorus]
Baby, won't you let me swing by?
Got me on this 3AM drive
Wanna be with you all night (You)
So I pull up like skrrt, I pull up like skrrt (I pull up like skrrt)
Pull up like skrrt, oh yeah-yeah

[Verse 1]
Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes, I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

[Chorus]
You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
(Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)

[Verse 2]
I mention you when I say my prayers
I wrap you around all of my thoughts
Boy, you're my temporary high
I wish that when I wake up you're there
To wrap your arms around me for real
And tell me you'll stay by my side

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds filled with stars cover the skies (Cover the skies)
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

[Bridge]
Tattoo your name across my heart
So it will remain
Not even death could make us part
What kind of dream is this?

[Chorus]
You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
(Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you

[Verse 1]
Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes, I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

(Turn the lights on)
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you

[Intro]
Yeah
Look
Make it clap
Yeah
Huh, do that
Yeah
Look

[Verse]
When I'm drunk, nigga, can't see my shades, too dark
And I'm stuntin' and them haters hatin' way too hard
They try to cut me out but my fade too sharp
See me, I get it in, you stay, blue balls
Bustin' shots in the crowd, watch 'em move like U-Haul
How you feel when that blammer pointed right at you, dawg?
When you climbin' to the top, niggas wish that you fall
'Cause I call the shots, I'm a cue ball
Huh, look, stanky ass demeanor
Better watch your girlfriend, ask me have I seen her
Took us to the bathroom, made her sign a prenup
Yeah, we did the nasty, then I made her clean up
Huh, wild, dawg
And she wanted me to tame her like a wild hog
You said you want it rough, take that smile off
Girl, you tellin' lies, it's a mile long
Ha, yeah, gon' and clap your hands
And I just bought this whole bar up, you better dance
This nigga sick, this beat my medicine
It's only makin' me get better, fuck that better than
Yup, yeah, them other guys
Not talkin' 'bout my food, but them slugs will fly
Hors d'oeuvres, I'm a nerd, it's televised
See me flippin' them birds to jealous guys
Haha, look, got about a hundred snapbacks in my Cadillac
There's so much green, racks on racks, I need cataracts
And your girl, when I get her, you can't have her back
So you be stuck with that pussy face like maxi-pads
Ugh, let me cough it up
I'm like cocaine 'cause everything I spit dope as fuck
Move artists, why you mad? Need to open up
I shoot targets and they wounds never close up
Ha, what my favorite word? Hol' up
She bringin' all the girls, 'bout four of 'em
And then they call more girls, 'bout four dozen
And no niggas, just me and my four cousins
Yeah, and they pull up, gon' have a barbeque
Yeah, let me tweet it out, let me call a few
Baby, I bought the stripper pole just for you
And I was hopin' that these hundreds would just stick to you
Ha, D&D on it
I'm the shit on this track, guess they peed on it
Better respect, nigga, we on it
Call 'em rejects, but we don't be lonely
Yeah, all I need is some liquor and a lighter
Chest burnin' like "Agh," shout out my nigga Tyga
And if I'm talkin' loud, you know that shit is fire
And if we need some more shit, I'll put it on my rider
Wake up to a morning so listless
Come to, sun is looming in
Careless, glide on over my eyelids
Show me opportunity

Give it up like I did in my old days
Shake it off 'cause I'm living in my own way
Shake it off 'cause I'm coming 'round again
Lying at your door

Don't stop, let the rhythm get faster
Blindly as I stumble in
Take the lead, but my world is so backwards
Can't believe I'm at the start again

Such a fake, running way past the goal line
Laugh it off 'cause I made that joke so many times
Shake it off 'cause I'm coming 'round again
Lying at your door

Shaking it off (I never thought I'd be the last one)
Shaking it off (Now every chance I had is gone)
Shaking it off
Shaking it off (Shaking it off)

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Your voice is music to my ears, I'm wide awake
Stuck on the way your frequencies resonate
You say that no matter what, you're watchin' over me
I knew when I first read your lips
Only angels speak like this

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
You encourage everyone without tryin'
All of your boundaries keep me in line
God is within us, what you're always sayin'
Your energy is enough to suffice

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Your intentions are obvious
Your affection's miraculous
Every promise you make, you keep
Never met nobody else like this
Only angels speak like this

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Your voice is music to my ears, I'm wide awake
Stuck on the way your frequencies resonate
You say that no matter what, you're watchin' over me
I knew when I first read your lips

La-dee-da, da-da-dee-da
Dee-da, la-da
La-dee-da, da-da-dee-da
Dee-da, da-da
Only angels speak like this

[Verse 2: Poo Bear]
The cadence you speak, it keeps us both in sync
The ocean we lay in makes it hard to think (Ooh)
Our spirits combine and it's a basic instinct
Your love is free-spoken, not written in ink (Ohh woah)

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber & Poo Bear]
Your intentions are obvious (Obvious)
Your affection's miraculous (I cherish your touch)
Every promise you make, you keep (Ooh)
Never met nobody else like this
Only angels speak like this

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Poo Bear]
Your voice is music to my ears, I'm wide awake (I'm wide awake)
Stuck on the way your frequencies resonate (How they resonate)
You say that no matter what (No matter what), you're watchin' over me (You're watchin' over me)
I knew when I first read your lips (Your lips)
Only angels speak like this (Like this)

You can take it out on me
You can take it out on me

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I don't mind you havin' the worst day
Oh, no, I don't
All the stress turns into built-up energy
Yes, it does
On the edge, I'm your net, go on and fall back
Easy on that pressure point, I love to push that
Let your frustrations out right here
I'm your psychiatrist, let's talk about it
We can use sign language, I know your body
I see the weight weighin' on your shoulders
It's so heavy
Let me be the meaning of your composure
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
You can take it out on me
You can take it out on me
I'll be your punching bag, hit me with all of your might
And get it all out 'til you feel light

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm your plug
Whatever you need, I'll make sure you get enough
And when your battery gets low
I'ma be the one to charge you up
Let me massage your mental and your physical
Whenever you lose doubt, I'll be your miracle
When you're around me, you should feel invincible
Please don't forget that

[Chorus]
You can take it out on me, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
You can take it out on me, hey, hey, hey, hey
I'll be your punching bag, hit me with all of your might (Hey)

And take it out on me (Oh-oh-woah)
You can take it out on me (Oh-oh-woah)

Ain't nobody got no patience

Ain't nobody got no patience
Want what they want right now
Ain't no need in being so anxious
I can hear your heart beating out loud

[Pre-Chorus]
Quit acting like we're in a race
Beggin' me, you know I'm on the way over
Take a moment to cherish this space
So quick to move forward, no pressure

[Chorus]
And we got the rest
Got the rest, got the rest of our lives
We got the rest
Got the rest, got the rest of our lives
All you ever really want
All you ever really need is at home

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Look at how it's all unfolding
Yeah, persistence at its finest
Like you wanted in before the door was open
Instead of lettin' what's scripted play out

[Pre-Chorus]
Quit acting like we're in a race
Beggin' me, you know I'm on the way over
Take a moment to cherish this space
So quick to move forward, no pressure

[Chorus]
And we've got the rest (Hey, hey)
Got the rest, got the rest of our lives
We got the rest (Oh-ooh)
Got the rest, got the rest of our lives
All you ever really want
All you ever really need is at home

He laid down his life, paid the price, yeah, get that
Comin' with the drama, lil’ mama I ain't with that
Breakin' up the bread, pour the wine then I sip that
I ain’t gotta flex, I already got a six pack
This that Hallelujah
I ain't tryna break it down but I'll break it to you
Fake friends come around but don't let 'em use you
I don't wanna lose you
Let the spirit move you
Ain't it funny how the money and the car and the clothes
Weren't nothin’ till I met Jesus
And ain’t it funny how they look up in the sky see the stars and the moon and still don't believe ’em
Ain't it funny how the money and the car and the clothes
Weren't nothin' till I met Jesus
And ain’t it funny how they look up in the sky see the stars and the moon and still don't believe 'em

[Chorus: Quavo]
How many crosses on my neck, let me check
I need more (Ice), I need more (Jesus)
How many crosses on my neck, let me check
I need more (Ice), I need more (Jesus)
Holy water on the neck
And that's what I need more (Ice), I need more (Jesus)
Holy water on the neck
And that's what I need more (Ice), I need more (Go)

[Post-Chorus: Quavo]
Holy cross, let me shake the demons off (Holy)
He lost that prize in the sauce (Holy)
Pay your ties, young man, pay the cost (Ties)
Pay your ties, young man, pay the cost (Yeah)

[Verse: Justin Bieber]
He laid down His life, paid the price, yeah, get that
Comin' with the drama, lil' mama I ain't with that
Breakin' up the bread, pour the wine then I sip that
I ain't gotta flex, I already got a six pack
This that Hallelujah
I ain't tryna break it down but I'll break it to you
Fake friends come around but don't let 'em use you
I don't wanna lose you
Let the spirit move you
Ain't it funny how the money and the car and the clothes
Weren't nothin' till I met Jesus
And ain't it funny how they look up in the sky see the stars and the moon and still don't believe 'em
Ain't it funny how the money and the car and the clothes
Weren't nothin' till I met Jesus
And ain't it funny how they look up in the sky see the stars and the moon and still don't believe 'em

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G]
Another day in the ghetto
One look outside I'm already upset, yo
It look about a hundred-and-two
It's a Saturday and Biggie ain't got nothing to do
Uh, I'm interrupted by a phone ring
Sometimes I wish I never got the motherfucking thing
"Hello hello? Can I speak to Biggie?"
Yo, who dis? "Taisha" Yo call back, I'm busy
Why don't ya hit me on the box a little later?
Washed up, got dressed, hits the elevator
Steps out, it's the same old scene
Dope fiend, crack fiend, eyewitness news team
I seen a honey with a butt looking butter soft
I know she looks much better with them clothes up off
Sitting all thick, with the ruby red lipstick
That's the one I got to get with

[Chorus: Notorious BIG]
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha?
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha?
"Why you wanna get with me?"
'Cause you got a big B-U-T, T, see
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha?
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha?
"Why you wanna get with me?"
'Cause you got a big B-U-T, T

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G]
She said "If I get with you
I gotta get witcha whole hood rat crew, whatcha I think I do?
Sling skins for a living, my name ain't November
This ain't Thanksgiving, you ain't Michael Bivins
Smack it up, flip it, rub it down
Do me baby, I ain't down
My name ain't 2Pac I don't "Get Around"
You hitting this nigga, how that sound?"
Huh, first of all you got me mixed up with
Somebody ya done slept with, hold up
That's my Neneh Cherry shit, I got something slicker
Let me just sip up on this liquor
All I wanna do is smoke a little chronic
Slam ya like Onyx, and get ya hooked on
This Biggie Smalls phonics, 102
How to squeeze 22's in them Reebok shoes, HUH?

[Chorus: Notorious BIG]
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha?
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha?
"Why you wanna get with me?"
'Cause you got a big B-U-T, T, see
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha?
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha?
"Why you wanna get with me?"
'Cause you got a big B-U-T, T

[Verse 3: Notorious B.I.G]
I said walk me upstairs, 'cause I forgot my Phillies
She said "I don't care, so don't be acting silly"
I knew I had her trapped with my hardcore raps
And it wouldn't take a second before I had her on her back
Pulling back the bra straps, threw on my Silk CD
'Cause, "I wanna get freaky with you"
Lose control on the skins is all I can picture, now I'm about to hit you

[Chorus]
Can I get witcha? Oww!
Can I get witcha?
"Why you wanna get with me?"
'Cause you got a big B-U-T, uh, hey
Can I get witcha? Uh
Can I get witcha? Hey
Can I get witcha? You big booty bitch, c'mon
Oh, you'se a big booty bitch
And I wanna do, do, do, do, do, do
Woah, woah
Can I get a soul clap?
Soul clap, soul clap
Yo, we buggin' the fuck out in this motherfucker, word
Yo, lemme hear the third verse, yo, that was the end

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Meek Mill]
You know I still believe, still believe in you and me
'Cause every night I go to sleep, go to sleep
I can see it like a movie in my dreams
Put my face in the dirt on the ground
Still, I raise up to take back the crown, yes
You can break my body
But you can't lock the soul of a man down (Yeah, uh)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Follow your dreams, not your addictions
How we gon' follow our dreams locked in a prison?
They tried to swallow me whole, God be my witness
Deprive me out of my dreams but I'm relentless
I want the money, ain't never want attention
So I don't pay attention to comments and all the mentions
'Cause they ain't see my vision
I was washin' dishes 'til my rags turned into riches
Glad when it was Christmas
We ain't even barely get presents, but we was gifted
In the school of failure, we present, perfect attendance
Welfare baby, we workin' with what they give us
Made me some commas, judge still gave me a sentence
No period, city girls don't get scared when it's really real
When your bank account twenty mil' and your house up on a hill
And your fam in the driveway, you walk out and see the grill
Thank God you believe, make sure you pray when you kneel, yeah

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Meek Mill]
You know I still believe, still believe in you and me
'Cause every night I go to sleep, go to sleep
I can see it like a movie in my dreams
Put my face in the dirt on the ground
Still, I raise up to take back the crown, yes
You can break my body
But you can't lock the soul of a man down (Yeah, uh)

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
My bank account, it was on super-zero
Ain't never panic, I'm a superhero (Uh)
Target my goals and I'ma shoot the arrow
When God turned the heat up on me, he said "You De Niro"
Play your part, got some brains like the scarecrow
Let's play it smart, 'cause we ain't playin' checkers, this is chess, play your pawns
Sit back like a king, when they move, make your mark
And never ever let your competition take your heart (Take your heart)
Say I believe in myself
When everybody stop believin', never leave on yourself
They had my back against the wall, I had to lean on myself
Almost made me put my dreams on the shelf, I'm trippin' (I'm trippin')
Laws of attraction, you just think I'm rappin'
I'm just puttin' out the energy so I can grab it
Everything that's in my memory that I imagined
It's finally here, hundred million in a year

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I still believe, still believe in you and me
'Cause every night I go to sleep, go to sleep
I can see it like a movie in my dreams
Put my face in the dirt on the ground
Still, I raise up to take back the crown, yes
You can break my body
But you can't lock the soul of a man down

[Outro: Justin Timberlake, Meek Mill, Justin Timberlake & Meek Mill]
As I lay (As I lay) me down to sleep (Down to sleep)
Pray the Lord (Pray) my soul to keep (Soul to keep)
Fallen ones, (Fallen ones) rest in peace (R.I.P.)
Please, God, watch over me (Watch over me)
As I lay (As I lay) me down to sleep (Down to sleep)
Pray the Lord (Pray) my soul to keep (My soul to keep)
Fallen ones, (Fallen ones) rest in peace (R.I.P.)
Please, God, watch over me

[Chorus]
Now I moved out my mama crib when I was 21 (21, ha, yeah)
I got an older bitch, I make her feel like she was 21 (21)
That's player, that's player, that's player, that's player
These hoes wanna join the team, I treat 'em like I'm playin' 21 (21) Solo, solo, solo, solo
How many shots I finna take tonight? Like 21 (21)
For sure, for sure, for sure, for sure (Ha)
Bitch, I'm one of one

[Verse 1]
Now I treat every single day like it's a blessing, you know?
If ain't life or death, then what's the point of stressin', you know?
I'ma treat all my old relationships as lessons, you dig? (Yeah)
I'ma eat all that I can eat to put the rest in the fridge
I knew I was a millionaire, before I had it, yeah
Before the status, just the auditions and practice, yeah
Before I hit the bank and filled that bitch up with checks like a ballot
B.I.G. a health freak, I'm eating pussy and salad
Once you get to that palace, you can't go back to your last crib
And when you start pop-poppin' bottles, you can't go back to glasses
And once you get a Cleopatra, you can't go back to your last bitch
And when I turned 21, I realized that time ain't going backwards

[Chorus]
Now I moved out my mama crib when I was 21 (21, ha, yeah)
I got an older bitch, I make her feel like she was 21 (21)
That's player, that's player, that's player, that's player
These hoes wanna join the team, I treat 'em like I'm playin' 21 (21) Solo, solo, solo, solo
How many shots I finna take tonight? Like 21 (21)
For sure, for sure, for sure, for sure (Ha)
Bitch, I'm one of one, for sure though

[Open Verse]

[Chorus]
Now I moved out my mama crib when I was 21 (21, ha, yeah)
I got an older bitch, I make her feel like she was 21 (21)
That's player, that's player, that's player, that's player
These hoes wanna join the team, I treat 'em like I'm playin' 21 (21) Solo, solo, solo, solo
How many shots I finna take tonight? Like 21 (21)
For sure, for sure, for sure, for sure (Ha)
Bitch, I'm one of one

[Intro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, no

[Verse]
You shut me down, you locked me out
You do the things I hate about you
At the end, end of it all, I'm still here
You sit me down and you kick me out
It's like we go up just to go down
I say I'm out but then somehow, I'm still there

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe, it's the way
That you make everything okay
Yeah, you're the one that soothes my pain
But you get too into my bra-a-a-ain

[Chorus]
Yeah, I love you, but I hate me
Maybe you're one to change me
You're the one that can save me
Yeah, I know, I know, I know, oh
Yeah, I love you, but I hate me
Maybe you're one to change me
You're the one that can save me
I know, I know, I know, oh

You're the one that can save me
I know, I know, I know, oh

Lyrics from Snippet:

[Verse 1]
Found a boy, he told me I was a star
He held the door, he held my hand in the dark
And he's perfect on paper, but he's lying to my face
Does he think that I'm the kinda girl who needs to be saved?

[Verse 2]
And there's one more boy, he's from my past
We fell in love, but it didn't last
The second I get close, he pushes me away
And I won't fight for love if you won't meet me halfway, mmm

[Chorus]
'Cause all I want is love that lasts
Is all I've seen all I'll ever have?
Seems like I always get this close
Are my expectations far too high?
The good guys are just hard to find
Try my best, but what can I say?
I'm by myself at the end of the day
At least I've got myself at the end of the day

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez]
When I opened up my eyes today
Felt the sun shining on my face
It became so clear to me that everything is going my way
I feel like there's no limit to what I can see
Got rid of fears that were holding me
My endless possibility has the whole world opened for me
That's why...

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I'm feeling so good (Feeling good)
I knew that I would (I knew I would)
Been taking care of myself like I should (Been taking care of myself)
'Cause I don't think anyone can bring me down (I don't think, bring me down)
Nothing in this world's gon' turn me around

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
Now the day is turning into night
And everything is still going right
There's no way you can stop me this time
Or break this spirit of mine, oh, no
Like the stars above, I'm gonna shine
Anything I want will be mine
Tonight, I'm gonna have a good time
Call a few friends of mine
'Cause I'm loving life, and tonight's for feeling

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I'm feeling so good (Feeling good)
I knew that I would (I knew I would)
Been taking care of myself like I should (Like I should, yeah)
'Cause I don't think anyone can bring me down (I don't think, bring me down)
Nothing in this world's gon' turn me around
I'm feeling so...

[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez & Big Punisher]
Party on tonight (Come on, let's dance)
Everything is feeling right (Come on)
DJ (Let's dance, come on, let's dance, come on, let's dance)
Party on tonight (Come on, let's dance)
Everything is feeling right (Come on)
DJ (Let's dance, come on, let's dance, come on)
World's gon' to turn me around

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I'm feeling so good (Feeling good)
I knew that I would (I knew I would)
Been taking care of myself like I should (If you could just play my song for me)
'Cause I don't think anyone can bring me down (I don't think, bring me down)
Nothing in this world's gon' turn me around
I'm feeling so good (Feeling good)
I knew that I would (I knew I would)
Been taking care of myself like I should
'Cause I don't think anyone can bring me down (I don't think, bring me down)
Nothing in this world's gon' turn me around
I'm feeling so good (Feeling good)
I knew that I would (I knew I would)
Been taking care of myself like I should

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Ayy, ayy, Soulja
Dre, Dre, money, Dre
Ayy

[Verse]
Let me tell y'all a lil' story about Soulja
Pulled up to the trap in a all black Rover
Bought the homie cash and I'm feelin' like I took it over
Bought the homie cash and I'm feelin' like I took it over
Call Lil' K up, bring the fuckin' camera, bruh
It's about to be a movie, I got too much stamina
All these guns around me, I feel like Floyd Mayweather
Came out the water wit' a hunnid on my damn shoulder
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em, I'm tatted up like Little Wayne
I'm tatted up like Little Wayne
Soulja Boy Tell Them, I'm tatted up like Lil Wayne
I'm tatted up like Lil Wayne
Smokin' kushy to the head, she fucked me like she know me
I just won a hunnid racks, that's word to Kobe
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em, I do not like these rap niggas
Came out the trap, nigga, I don't know how to act, nigga
But I'm in the movie and I'm feelin' like a hustler
Hit her from the back and I'll dig her like a shoveler
Young Soulja Tell 'Em, man, I don't give a fuck 'bout colors, bitch
Black chain, white chain, yellow Lambo', fast lane, I'm gone
There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still we're often told "seek and ye shall find"
So I'm going to seek a certain girl I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found her yet
She's the big affair I cannot forget
Only girl I ever think of with regret

I'd like to add her initial to my monogram
Tell me where's the shepherd for this lost lamb

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that she turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me

I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
To one who'll watch over me

Although she may not the girl some men think of
As handsome to my heart
She carries the key
Won't you tell her please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh how I need
Someone to watch over me
Someone to watch over me

It's very clear our love is here to stay
Not for a year but ever and a day
The radio and the telephone and the movies that we know
May just be passing fancies, and in time may go

But, oh my dear, our love is here to stay
Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble
Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay
But, oh my dear, our love is here to stay

Together we're going a long, long way
In time the Rockies may crumble
Gibraltar may tumble
They're only made of clay
But our love is here to stay
Our love is here to stay

[Verse]
Yeah I'm an addict, can't help myself
I love too much I probably need some help
You see the trouble, yes I try to change
My heart is screaming out too loud
The love keeps drowning out my brain

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't pop or cry for you cause' we both know
You don't deserve my tears
Won't live or die for you
Cause' this is where I diss on you right here

[Chorus]
So ima' hit you where it hurts and that's your ego
You'll have to pray you make it out alive
Say fuck you and forget you just like Ceelo
And turn your heart to trash like you did mine
I'm gonna diss on you, if it's the last I do
I'm gonna diss on you, diss on you, diss on you

[Verse]

[Chorus]
Tell me close, throw on amazing

Turn her up, turn her up, turn her raisin'
Tell me close, throw on amazing
Tell me your kind, I'm your favorite
Turn her up, turn her up, turn her raisin'
Turn her up, turn her up, turn her raisin'

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
When you were standing in the wake of devastation
When you were waiting on the edge of the unknown
And with the cataclysm raining down
Insides crying, "Save me now"
You were there, impossibly alone

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure's all you've known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go, let it go

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
And in a burst of light that blinded every angel
As if the sky had blown the heavens into stars
You felt the gravity of tempered grace
Falling into empty space
No one there to catch you in their arms

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure’s all you’ve known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go, let it go

[Bridge: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure's all you've known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go

Let it go
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure's all you've known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go, let it go

[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Just a voice like a riot rocking every revision
But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
And though the words sound steady
Something empty's within them

We say yeah, with fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there
'Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear
Until we dead it, forget it, let it all disappear

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Waiting for the end to come
Wishing I had strength to stand
This is not what I had planned
It's out of my control

Flying at the speed of light
Thoughts were spinning in my head
So many things were left unsaid
It's hard to let you go

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I know what it takes to move on
I know how it feels to lie
All I want to do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Sitting in an empty room
Trying to forget the past
This was never meant to last
I wish it wasn't so

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I know what it takes to move on
I know how it feels to lie
All I want to do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
What was left when that fire was gone?
I thought it felt right, but that right was wrong
All caught up in the eye of the storm
And trying to figure out what it's like moving on

And I don't even know what kind of things I said
My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead
So, I'm picking up the pieces now, where to begin
The hardest part of ending is starting again

[Outro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
All I want to do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Just a voice like a riot, rocking every revision
I'm holding on to what I haven't got
But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
Though the words sound steady
Something empty's within them

We say yeah, with fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there
Holding on to what I haven't got
'Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear
Until we get it, forget it, let it all disappear

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
God bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought
It can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched
It can't be outrun, no!
God bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought
It can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched
It can't be outrun, no!

[Pre-Chorus 1: Chester Bennington and Mike]
And when I close my eyes tonight
To symphonies of blinding light!
God bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun

[Chorus: Chester]
Oh, like memories in cold decay
Transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I
Where oceans bleed into the sky!

[Verse 2: Chester]
God save us everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?
For the sins of our hand
The sins of our tongue
The sins of our father
The sins of our young? No!
God save us everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?
For the sins of our hand
The sins of our tongue
The sins of our father
The sins of our young? No!

[Pre-Chorus 2: Chester and Mike]
And when I close my eyes tonight
To symphonies of blinding light!
God save us everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?

[Chorus: Chester]
Oh, like memories in cold decay
Transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I
Where oceans bleed into the sky!

[Keyboard Solo]

[Chorus: Chester]
Oh, like memories in cold decay
Transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I
Where oceans bleed into the sky!

[Bridge: Chester and Mike]
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go

[Bridge: Mike]
It can't be outfought
It can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched
It can't be outrun, no!
God bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought
It can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched
It can't be outrun, no!
God bless us everyone
We're a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can't be outfought
It can't be outdone
It can't be outmatched
It can't be outrun

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Why does it feel like night today?
Something in here's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left

I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head

Like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall

(And watches everything)
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is here in me
Right underneath my skin

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I know I've got a face in me
Points out all my mistakes to me
You've got a face on the inside, too
And your paranoia's probably worse

I don't know what set me off first
But I know what I can't stand
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter
Is I can't add up to what you can

But everybody has a face that they hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time they lie
A face that laughs every time they fall

(And watches everything)
So you know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is watching you, too
Right inside your skin

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin

It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

[Interlude: Mike Shinoda]
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me

[Outro: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
(The sun) It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin
(I feel the light betray me)
(The sun) It's like I'm paranoid, looking over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
(I feel the light betray me)

It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, here we go for the hundredth time
Hand grenade pins in every line
Throw 'em up and let something shine
Going out of my fucking mind

Filthy mouth, no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won't get loose

Truth is, you can stop and stare
Bled myself out and no one cares
Dug the trench out, laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach, somewhere

Yeah, someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor, again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

[Chorus: Chester Bennington with Mike Shinoda]
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Go, stop the show
Choppy words and a sloppy flow
Shotgun opera, lock and load
Cock it back and then watch it go

Mama, help me, I've been cursed
Death is rolling in every verse
Candy paint on his brand new hearse
Can't contain him, he knows he works

Fuck, this hurts, I won't lie
Doesn't matter how hard I try
Half the words don't mean a thing
And I know that I won't be satisfied

So why try ignoring him?
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I've opened up these scars
I'll make you face this
I've pulled myself so far
I'll make you face this now

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away

I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I bleed it out
I bleed it out
I bleed it out

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile (Smile)
I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile (Smile)

[Verse 1]
Every day, Groundhog Day
Goin' through motions felt so fake
Not myself, not my best
Felt like I failed the test

[Pre-Chorus]
But every tear has been a lesson
Rejection can be God's protection
Long hard road to get that redemption
But no shortcuts to a blessin'

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile (Smile)
I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile (Smile)

[Verse 2]
I'm 2.0, remodeled
Used to be dull, now I sparkle
Had a piece of humble pie
That ego check saved my life

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I got a smile like Lionel Richie
Big and bright, need shades just to see me
Tryna stay alive just like I'm the Bee Gees (Oh, woah)
A Mona Lisa masterpiece (Now I'm)

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile (C'mon, smile, woo)
I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful (So grateful)
Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile (Smile, oh, oh)

[Bridge]
I'm so thankful
'Cause I finally, 'cause I finally
I'm so grateful
'Cause I finally, 'cause I finally (Oh)

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile (Woo, smile)
I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile (Smile, oh, oh)

[Outro]
I'm so thankful
'Cause I finally, 'cause I finally
Smile (Oh)
I'm so grateful
'Cause I finally, 'cause I finally
Smile (Oh, oh)
Wake from your sleep
The drying of your tears
Today we escape
We escape

Pack and get dressed
Before your father hears us
Before all hell
Breaks loose

Breathe, keep breathing
Don't lose your nerve
Breathe, keep breathing
I can't do this alone

Sing us a song
A song to keep us walking
There's such a chill
Such a chill

You can laugh a spineless laugh
We hope your rules and wisdom choke you
Now we are one in everlasting peace
We hope that you choke, that you choke

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Nah, you don't know me
Lightning above and a fire below me
You cannot catch me, cannot hold me
You cannot stop, much less control me

When it rains, it pours
When the floodgates open, brace your shores
That pressure don't care when it breaks your door
Say it's all you can take, better take some more

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
When I was young, they told me, they said
Make your bed, you lie in that bed
A king can only reign 'til instead
It comes that day, it's off with his head

A night gets darkest, right before dawn
What don't kill you makes you more strong
You'll have my mercy then, when you're gone
'Cause I know what it's like to test fate
Had my shoulders pressed with that weight
Stood up strong in spite of that hate

The night gets darkest, right before dawn
What don't kill you makes you more strong
And I've been waiting for it, so long

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes
Oh, oh, oh
Waiting for a light that never comes

[Verse 3: Mike Shinoda]
And I told them, nah, you don't know me
Lightning above and a fire below me
You cannot catch me, cannot hold me
You cannot stop, much less control me

When it rains, it pours
When the floodgates open, brace your shores
That pressure don't care, it breaks your door
Say it's all you can take, better take some more

[Chorus: Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda]
The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes
Oh, oh, oh
Waiting for a light that never comes

The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes (Take some more)
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Nah, you don't know me
Lightning above and a fire below me
You cannot catch me, cannot hold me

I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes
Oh, oh, oh
Waiting for a light that never comes

[Verse 3: Mike Shinoda]
And I told them, nah, you don't know me
Lightning above and a fire below me
You cannot catch me, cannot hold me
You cannot stop, much less control me

When it rains, it pours
When the floodgates open, brace your shores
That pressure don't care, it breaks your door
Say it's all you can take, better take some more

[Chorus: Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda]
The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes
Oh, oh, oh
Waiting for a light that never comes

The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes (Take some more)
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Nah, you don't know me
Lightning above and a fire below me
You cannot catch me, cannot hold me
You cannot stop, much less control me

When it rains, it pours
When the floodgates open, brace your shores
That pressure don't care when it breaks your door
Say it's all you can take, better take some more

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
When I was young, they told me, they said
Make your bed, you lie in that bed
A king can only reign 'til instead
It comes that day, it's off with his head

A night gets darkest, right before dawn
What don't kill you makes you more strong
You'll have my mercy then, when you're gone
'Cause I know what it's like to test fate
Had my shoulders pressed with that weight
Stood up strong in spite of that hate

The night gets darkest, right before dawn
What don't kill you makes you more strong
And I've been waiting for it, so long

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes
Oh, oh, oh
Waiting for a light that never comes

[Verse 3: Mike Shinoda]
And I told them, nah, you don't know me
Lightning above and a fire below me
You cannot catch me, cannot hold me
You cannot stop, much less control me

When it rains, it pours
When the floodgates open, brace your shores
That pressure don't care, it breaks your door
Say it's all you can take, better take some more

[Chorus: Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda]
The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes
Oh, oh, oh
Waiting for a light that never comes

The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes (Take some more)
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes

[Intro]

[Riff]

[Verse 1]
What is this that stands before me?
Figure in black which points at me
Turn 'round quick and start to run
Find out I'm the chosen one
Oh, no!

[Verse 2]
Big black shape with eyes of fire
Telling people their desire
Satan's sitting there, he's smiling
Watches those flames get higher and higher
Oh, no, no, please, God, help me!

[Outro]
Is it the end, my friend?
Satan's coming 'round the bend
People running 'cause they're scared
The people better go and beware
No, no, please, no!

[Verse 1]
Down on the west coast they got a saying
“If you’re not drinking, then you’re not playing”
But you got the music, you got the music in you
Don’t you?

[Verse 2]
Down on the west coast I get this feeling like
It all could happen, that’s why I’m leaving
You for the moment, you for the moment, boy blue
Yeah, you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You pull it hard, I push away, I’m feeling hot to the touch
You say you miss me and I wanna say I miss you so much
But something keeps me really quiet, I’m alive, I’m a-lush
Your love, your love, our love

[Chorus]
I can see my baby swinging
His parliament’s on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I’m singing
“Ooh baby, ooh baby, I’m in love”
I can see my sweet boy swaying
He’s crazy y Cubano como yo, l-love
On the balcony and I’m saying
“Move baby, move baby, I’m in love”

[Post-Chorus]
I’m in love (I’m in love)
I’m in love (I’m in love)

[Verse 3]
Down on the west coast they got their icons
Their silver starlets, their queens of Saigons
And you got the music, you got the music in you
Don’t you?

[Verse 4]
Down on the west coast they love their movies
Their golden gods and rock ’n’ roll groupies
And you got the music, you got the music in you
Don’t you?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You push it hard, I pull away, I’m feeling hotter than fire
I guess that no one ever really made me feel that much higher
Te de se yo cariño, boy, it’s you I desire
Your love, your love, our love
{Chorus - variation]
I can see my baby swinging
His parliament’s on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I’m singing
“Move baby, move baby, I’m in love”

I can see my baby swinging
His parliament’s on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I’m singing
“Ooh baby, ooh baby, I’m in love”

I can see my sweet boy swaying
He’s crazy y Cubano como yo, l-love
On the balcony and I’m saying
“Move baby, move baby, I’m in love”

[Outro]
I’m in love, I’m in love

[Intro]
Yeah
This motherfucker sour grape, nigga
Heh, yeah
SODMG, nigga
Pops On Da Beat

[Verse 1]
Ayy, and I'm just hoppin' out, lookin' fresh
Smokin' kushy to the chest, know my niggas be the best
Ayy, and youse niggas lookin' like some strangers
Nine millimeter, that mean you in danger
Pullin' up, everybody's starin' at her
Paparazzi's flarin' at me, everybody's starin' at me
Yellow diamonds on my neck, lookin' like a fuckin' lick
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em, bitch, take your pic (Uh huh)

[Chorus]
Ayy, any girls lookin' at me
They already know that I'm ridin' with some real niggas
Ayy, and they starin' at me and they lookin' at the kid
And they know I get it in, yeah, I get it in
I get it in, yeah, I get it in
Get it in, yeah, I get it in
Get it in, yeah, I get it in
Get it in, yeah

[Verse 2]
Louis this, Louis that, bitch, I'm high as fuck
Gucci this, Gucci that, bitch, I'm high as fuck
Flyer than a bitch, fresher than a ho
Just smoked off a whole pound of dro
Kushed up, I got kush in my lungs
Young Dre, and you know we gettin' funds
Fuck that, dog, I'ma tell you how we live
Fuck y'all, dog, bring the bitches to my crib
Yellow bone everywhere, and she's chocolate
Smokin' on that kush, sour tropic
Yellow candy paint, I'ma real young ass nigga
Get it in

[Chorus]
(Work) I get it in
(Work) I said I get it in
Heheheh, I get it in
(Soulja) I said I get it in

[Verse 3]
Coulda put the hook in, but I felt like jabbin'
Young Dre, AKA Soulja Boy Stab 'Em
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em, 'bout the millions and the mansions
Tell 'em 'bout the OG kush in the Hamptons
Five star hotel suite, like what's happenin'?
Damn, bought a brand new date for the captain
Makin' it happen, me and my team
And I'm iced out, no Supreme
Red beam, no Glocks
We ain't talkin' guns, heart stops
Young Dre, filled wit' plugs
You wanna get high, I got all the drugs
And we takin' it to the city
Welcome to my city, I get CÎROC like Diddy
Catch me in the city spendin' fifty in the club
VIP, and we got all the girls goin' up
Never goin' down, we ain't worried 'bout it
Kush by the jar, we can smoke about any 'otic
Anybody, anybody, see a bottle
Soulja Tell 'Em, I'm the one, see about me
And I mixed Xan wit' the lean
I put triple beam, dreams and a million in a thing
Nothin' but a dream, sellin' tours, couple minks
.40 on a clip, that's a new murder scene

[Intro]
Ayo, I never had common sense
But I had enough sense to calm my ass down and make my dollars stretch
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Uh, ayo, I never had common sense
But I had enough sense to calm my ass down and make my dollars stretch
I'm like basketball to net how I make it all connect
Move strong so the funds I collect come correct when the boss nigga check ya
If you don't come from the set, I don't respect ya
Better yet, jump on a jet and give them checks up
I never give nothin' less than my best
You can tell by the way that I'm dressed
Grey bottom and my dreads always fresh
Smoke so much, I swear that I'm blessed
Know so much, I swear I'm a genius
And I'm K-Oing niggas, we ain't callin' it even
Spent too much time online, I'm with your broad for the evening
She a big ol' freak, I pull it out and she eat it

[Verse 2]
You might think I got time to kill 'cause I'm so real
Lot of niggas I could've checked this year, but I'ma chill
I ain't gotta tell that they fake, in time, it will
When it come to being certified, I'm signed and sealed
Signed a deal since I was 16, I been gettin' cream
A young nigga smokin' weed like it's nicotine
Made my own scene
If that's your girl, then why she kick it with the whole team?
Smoke the whole thing
Eyes hella low, never tried, then you'll never know
Young Khalifa flows so incredible
Off of six joints and a edible
I don't write it down, it ain't legible
Professional from the head to toe
Big vegetables, we ain't smokin' no oregano
Never pedal slow, we just catch and go
And when I'm finished with this shit, it's gon' be set in stone
A real king, before I'm done, I'll have to get a throne
Better know as the nigga killin' every fuckin' verse
And puttin' rappers in a hearse
And when you do it like me, niggas see your blessings as a curse
But, shit, I could be doing worse

[Outro]
Fuck y'all

[Intro]
Sometimes, you gotta cut a motherfucker, huh?
Don't be that motherfucker
Haha
Realistically, I'm just sittin' back
Got back to the crib
Got a pile of KK, pack of cones
Just doing what I do
Ain't shit changed
Ugh

[Verse]
Smoking weed and living how I'm s'posed to be
The police don't say shit when they approach me
Different day, a different coast
I'm doing shit the way I'm s'posed to
Flyin' private, 'way from coach
Was a player, now, I coach, hundred mil', I'm tryna gross
Roll a pound and flow, pour a round and toast
Every day, we focused, no matter how much we smoke
Hit it, never miss, got these niggas pissed
Get caught? Never flip, charges get dismissed
Been a savage since I jumped off in this business shit
Nothing personal, must've forgot what this business is
I keep hustling and won't stop until my clique get rich
Won't do shit, you bury yourself, I'll let you dig that ditch
You a hustling motherfucker
New crib for my son, an AP for my brother, and it's flooded
Them girls ain't gon' get enough of it
Earn my respect, they gon' keep telling you that I'm fucking rich
Earn my respect, he just get jealous because I fucked his bitch
Earn my respect, so when they come to my house, they don't take pics
I'm killing the competition, they still ain't got my permission
I'm finna make my decision, I'm holding out my position

[Intro]
Tss
So she ran up on me and she was like "Damn, I miss you"
I had to tell the young lady:
"You can't miss what you still have
See, can't nobody take your spot
You don't miss me, you just missing out"
Hahaha
Ugh

[Verse]
I got you open off the words I spit
They tired of the rest, they need some gangster shit
Say I'm the best once the weed get lit
Don't leave your girl around me 'cause she might get hit
I rock Celine and all types of shit
At night, we in the studio, where mics get ripped
Doing my thing like a titan
These niggas' mouth hurt from all the biting
Niggas soft, I ain't nothing like 'em, don't need 'em
Say they my man but I don't believe 'em
I'm getting tanned with a Puerto Rican
Dropping new shit for my fans
Rings on the fingers, we them champs
Pull up to the party, high as fuck, I roll up in advance
I already know you niggas fake, never trust you again
Keep a lil' McQueen in my cup, Taylor cuff in my pants
'Nother red carpet, if they hit you up when I land

[Chorus]
G-A-N-G-S-T-A
I gotta keep it gangsta
G-A-N-G-S-T-A
I gotta keep it gangsta
G-A-N-G-S-T-A
I gotta keep it gangsta
G-A-N-G-S-T-A
I gotta keep it gangsta

[Outro]
It's Only Weed Bro
Hahahaha!
Relax
It's only weed

[Intro]
It's only weed
Ha-ha-ha
Female
Ha-ha-ha
Don't be rude
Use your manners

[Verse 1]
Joints get lit
Hate on me, what's the point of it?
These niggas I'm disappointed in
Can't hang with me like an ornament
If she bring a friend, she joining in
My gang official, we born to win
I'm rollin' weed and pourin' gin, woo!
'Nother plane, I board again
I revived, feel born again
I'm in the sky, I'm soaring in
Got a few vibes, bring 'em foreigns in
Valet be gettin' the door for him
She get them ones off the floor for them
Makin' these lil' niggas forfeit
If I ain't rappin', that mean I'm tourin'
Show up, I'm very important
They be like "It is Khalifa?", of course it is
Grindin', you don't have to force the kid
Marry the game, won't divorce the bitch
Makin' the money, you never make me
On top of game, you could never play me
I was at class, sitting next to JAY-Z
Smoking a joint with Nas and Swizz Beatz
Took off the Celine's, A1's on my feet
I'm rollin' a J, my night is complete

[Chorus: Sample]
Hello, morning, you look good, good to me
Kissing the sky, I can feel it move me
But on my own I would share this morning
Kiss the sunrise with my eyes, so give it ya

[Verse 2]
Damn
I'm really realizing that I'm the man
That if I really wanna do it, I can
I'm smoking that gas, I share with my fam
My foot on the gas, I stick to the plan
You don't know me personal, please don't call me Cam
And if you do, then some weed should be in your hand
I turn to the boss, got tired of the middle-man
I smoke when I want, roll up even in Japan
You hear me talk it, I live it
It's all 100, I don't got a gimmick
Pullin' my card and I don't got no limit
Rollin' the chronic up I'm like a chemist
Way that I ball, I might end up in Guinness
I know they probably think I'm a magician
Walk in and leave out with all of the bitches
I'm at the top, I don't see competition
If she with me, when I talk, she gon' listen
Run to the money, do not give it distance
Gettin' some millions, I got them intentions
And know I came from the bottom, my name at the top and I don't even ask for permission
And they all line up and ask for pictures
Hard to imagine this life that I'm living

[Chorus: Sample]
Hello, morning, you look good, good to me
Kissing the sky, I can feel it move me
But on my own I would share this morning
Kiss the sunrise with my eyes, so give it ya

[Outro: Sample]
Morning sunrise (Morning)
Morning sunrise (I said it's a beautiful morning)

[Intro]
Mhm
Yessir!
I say yessir!

[Verse 1]
I just copped a chain that I like
I just got some brain at the light
I don't even exchange if I don't like it
I go off the brain, I don't write
I've flown too many planes in my life
I need a bad bitch, not a wife
I need that plastic when I swipe
I need a million dollars, not advice
Call me, I hit, never call her twice
Call me the kid, my flow very nice
New car, new crib, watch look like a bucket full of ice
Fuck it, I'm just livin' life
All my niggas trained to go, but we don't wanna fight
Never coppin' when I land, we bring it on the flight
Said he got a mil', I said "I'll be there by tonight"
And I'm a boss, so I never pay the full price

[Chorus]
Silver shadow
I leave these niggas in the dust, they wish they could be us
Glowing shadow
These fake niggas I don't trust 'cause they see me out
Shining brightly
In the air, in the air
For all to see
And we ain't goin' nowhere, we gon' be right here

[Verse 2]
Big shadow, don't battle
But if I did, a nigga get dismantled
Up shit's creek, no paddle
Shit get deep, you shallow
Switch classrooms, need bad hoes
I can roll a paper plane with my eyes closed
Don't get rest, always on post
I'm sleepless, Seattle
Blowin' Cali kush, blue flannel
With a bad bitch, no manners
Yeah, she look good, can't stand her
Young rich nigga, don't matter
I'm the one, get the two or three after
You my sons, that's what I do with these bastards
I roll the kush up 'cause I need laughter
My life a movie, no actors

[Chorus]
Silver shadow
I leave these niggas in the dust, they wish they could be us
Glowing shadow
These fake niggas I don't trust 'cause they see me out
Shining brightly
In the air, in the air
For all to see
And we ain't goin' nowhere, we gon' be right here

[Verse 1]
How you want it? Now or later, I blow a pound of flavors
I'm always rollin kush, don't be with entertainers
This ain't just for the look, don't feel like I need favors
Don't play it by the book, occupation smokin' papers
When I pull up they look, cool with the cops and neighbors
I got these niggas shook, like helicopter chases
My car win races, my broad was racist
But now she wanna kick it, get her little brother tickets
I talk, I live it, I ball, I pivot
I go the distance, I'm so persistent
How I'm livin', stackin' millions
Rappin' to children, gettin' that pack in the buildin'
That real shit, I'm bringin' the feelin'
That bad bitch, she bringin' my meal in
My swag good, you think you could steal it
That bag good, I think it's a million

[Break]
Count it up
Count the motherfuckin' money man
When's the last time you ran somethin'?
Never, motherfucka!
Ha ha ha ha
Matter fact, as long as you know how to roll in 2020, you good
You gang!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

[Verse 2]
Who that is
Countin' up, keep the weed tucked
Got a bottle of that new McQueen stuff
Your bitch trippin', tell her ease up
You can see the ink when my sleeves up
It's hoes down, always g's up
Put some money down, Rollie freeze up
What would you do if you paid 4.5?
You would live comfortable too, decorate all of your rooms
I don't know why they assume, only make boss type of moves
They clout chase, I'm hardly amused, but I still try to be cool
I spend a thousand on shoes, I got a house with a pool
I got a mountain to move, she got a mouth, I recruit
If I'm gettin' paper, she count it up too
If I know the price, my accountant do too
I fly in a place, smoke a pound, and I'm through
All my niggas eat full, what happened to you?

[Outro]
Y'all niggas lookin' real sad
You look happy, but you look sad
All that partyin' and shit and buyin' shit
You just fillin' an empty motherfuckin' space
Some shit you wish you had
It's cool 'cause I know what it feel like 'cause I got it nigga
Yeah
I got it

[Verse 1]
One for the money
With a hurt foot, I'ma run to the money
From the dirt, nigga, I don't come from the money
For what it's worth, I'ma get it done for the money
Bad bitch with a accent
Askin' for her IG, she just wanna know where the cash is
Where she from you can't imagine
At home, she got some bad kids
You ain't my sons, you my grandkids
Outlandish, caught you red-handed
Stealin' styles, that's standard
But what happen when you get abandoned?
That mean I'ma leave a lot of niggas stranded
Fired up, they wanna know what the strain is
Roll another one
Always knew I'd be the man when I was comin' up
The game made a nigga toughen up
Now all the girls wanna come with us
I don't need to know her number
If it's on, then it's on, meet me deeply undercover
We don't text or call each other
I give my all or nothing

[Chorus]
Let you do all the cuffing
Doobies, I'ma roll a hundred, I done brought enough in
When I handle my biz, ain't no interruption
I just let my money talk, it ain't no discussion
The way that shorty give me head, she get a concussion
The best thing that you could do is don't make an assumption
The flow's so dope, cops come in, you flush it

[Verse 2]
Man, my watch bustin'
I'ma always take my time, I don't ever rush shit
Goin' for fourth down while you niggas puntin'
I just throw a couple rounds, I don't do the lovin'
Not to mention fussin'
Don't be callin' up my phone sayin' all that fuck shit
Got McQueen, couple gold bottles at the function
Say I'm lookin' like a boss, but it's really nothin'
I just came from customs
Got your bitch crushin'
See me and she blushin'
She just left her husband

[Chorus]
Let you do all the cuffing
Doobies, I'ma roll a hundred, I done brought enough in
When I handle my biz, ain't no interruption
I just let my money talk, it ain't no discussion
The way that shorty give me head, she get a concussion
The best thing that you could do is don't make an assumption
The flow's so dope, cops come in, you flush it
Back into the funhouse
Music is sublime
See the lady’s spinning
She’ll show me

We all lie in the funhouse
No one is your friend
No one loves a loser
We love you

In the funhouse
In the funhouse
In the funhouse
In the funhouse
In the funhouse
In the funhouse

We’ll show you
Really good time

We all lie in the funhouse
Girls wag their pain
No one sleeps in the funhouse
They’ll show you
We’ll show you

In the funhouse
In the funhouse
In the funhouse

We’ll show you
Really good time

Back into the funhouse
My dreamdogs have arrived
My summer turns to fall
And I’ll miss you

We’ll show you
She’ll show me
We’ll show you
She’ll show me
Really good time
Really good time

[Verse 1]
Do you hear the thunder
Raging in the sky?
Premonition of a shattered world
That's gonna die
In the age of reason
How do we survive?
The protocols of evil ravaging
So many lives
So many lives
So many lives

[Verse 2]
Mystifying silence
Talking peace on Earth
We should judge each other for ourselves
Not what we're worth
Sustainable extinction
A fractured human race
A jaded revolution disappears
Without a trace
Without a trace
Without a trace
Alright yeah!

[Bridge]
Always felt that there'd be trouble
Mass distraction hides the truth
Prozac days and sleepless hours
Seeds of change that don’t bear fruit

[Outro]
Oh yeah

These times are heavy
And you're all alone
The battle's over, but the war goes on
Politics, religion, love of money too
It's what the world was built for
But not for me and you, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Lost in the darkness, I fade from the light
Faith of my father, my brother, my Maker and Savior
Help me make it through the night
Blood on my conscience
And murder in mind
Out of the gloom I rise up from my tomb
Into impending doom
Now my body is my shrine

[Chorus 1]
The blood runs free
The rain turns red
Give me the wine, you keep the bread
The voices echo in my head
Is God alive or is God dead?
Is God dead?

[Verse 2]
Rivers of evil, run through dying land
Swimming in sorrow, they kill, steal, and borrow
There is no tomorrow
For the sinners will be damned
Ashes to ashes
You cannot exhume a soul
Who do you trust when corruption and lust creed of all the unjust
Leaves you empty and unwhole?

[Chorus 2]
When will this nightmare be over?
Tell me
When can I empty my head?
Will someone tell me the answer?
Is God really dead?
Is God really dead?

[Verse 3]
To safeguard my philosophy
Until my dying breath
I transfer from reality
Into a living death
I empathize with enemies
Until the timing’s right
With God and Satan at my side
From darkness will come light

[Chorus 3]
I watch the rain as it turns red
Give me more wine
I don’t need bread
These riddles that live in my head
I don’t believe that God is dead
God is dead

[Bridge]
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Wondering if we will meet again on the other side
Do you believe a word what the Good Book said?
Or is it just a holy fairytale and God is dead?
God is dead, God is dead
God is dead, God is dead, right?

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus 4]
But still the voices in my head
Are telling me that God is dead
The blood pours down, the rain turns red
I don’t believe that God is dead
God is dead, God is dead
God is dead, God is dead

[Verse 1]
Well, I don’t want no Jesus freak to tell me what it’s all about
No black magician telling me to cast my soul out
Don’t believe in violence, I don’t even believe in peace
I’ve opened the door, now my mind has been released

[Verse 2]
Well, I don’t want no preacher telling me about the god in the sky
No, I don’t want no one to tell me where I’m gonna go when I die
I want to live my life, I don’t want people telling me what to do
I just believe in myself ’cause no one else is true

[Bridge: Every Day Comes and Goes]
Every day just comes and goes
Life is one long overdose
People try to rule the nation
I just see through their frustration
People hiding their real face
Keep on running their rat race
Behind each flower grows a weed
In their world of make-believe

[Verse 3]
So believe what I tell you, it’s the only way to fight in the end
Just believe in yourself you know you really shouldn’t have to pretend
Don’t let those empty people try to interfere with your mind
Just live your life and leave them all behind

[Verse 1]
Is this the end of the beginning?
Or the beginning of the end?
Losing control or are you winning?
Is your life real or just pretend?
Reanimation of the sequence
Rewinds the future to the past
To find the source of the solution
The system has to be recast

[Verse 2]
Release your mind
Fast forward to the secrets of your soul
Your life's on overload
Delete or save
The units that make you an entity
That's your identity
If you don't know
Which way to go
You might be lost and confused
A second chance no time to lose
Regeneration of your cyber sonic soul
Transforming time and space beyond control
Rise up, resist, and be the master of your fate
Don't look badly for today, tomorrow is too late

[Guitar Solo 1]

[Verse 3]
You don't wanna be a robot ghost
Occupied inside the human host
Analyzed and cloned relentlessly
Synthesized until they set you free
Alright, okay, alright
'Til they set you free
Alright, okay
'Til they set you free

[Guitar Solo 2]

[Outro]
I don't wanna see you, yeah
I don't wanna see you, yeah

[Intro]
Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo

[Verse 1]
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over—blaow!
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo, this old rap shit, he
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

[Verse 2]
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option—failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot: feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go!)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better…

[Outro]
You can do anything you set your mind to, man

[Verse]
Give until I can't give
I lend a hand if it's needed
But these stabs got me bleeding out my back, kid
Uh, keep it on the fumble, we could sack shit
Hat trick, we considered Mulligan's for that shit
The proof is in the pudding and the pamphlets
The sewer and the mattress, stupid nigga, you could get it
Uh, only thing certain is these taxes
Burn me when the journey ends
Clergyman, turn me into ashes
I move surgically, with new sermons for the masses
We too purpose for the scraps
What the verdict read, is that courtesy of shit circumstances
The earth is my turf but the hearse like a magnet
I'll be outside in some handcuffs, I'll be outside in the dirt, uh
Gentrifies, got your turf getting hacked up
Late nights, thinking 'bout who lied to me first
Graveyard energy, I'm tied to the job
Strictly based off principle
My inner jit grinnin', but my face all twisted
It's the artist at work
Greyhound tickets and some haze on my missus
No, it make no sense to keep my heart on my shirt
But when the rain storm's vicious, spend the day blowing, drinking
Trying to harvest the hurt, but it make no difference

[Verse 1]
We passed upon the stair
We spoke of was and when
Although I was not there
He said I was his friend
Which came as some surprise
I spoke into his eyes, "Must've died alone
A long long time ago"

[Chorus]
Oh no, not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

[Verse 2]
I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched for form and land
For years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazeless stare
At all the millions here
We must have died alone
A long long time ago

[Chorus]
Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

[Chorus]
Who knows? Not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world
Oh no, not me
I never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold
The world

[Intro]
Mmm
Mmm
Mmm

[Verse 1]
I know your favorite song
I hear it every day
Whoever made your smile
Made it to get in my way
And every time you laugh
You make that little sound
It's just the hardest thing
To love you, but not know how

[Pre-Chorus]
So I spend all my nights in the dark and afraid
'Cause I've tried to forget you
But these things just don't go away

[Chorus]
I hate that you're perfect, perfect for me
If I didn't know better, then I would believe
That we were made for each other, but I'd know the truth
You're no good for me, I'm no good for you
And I hate that you're perfect, you're perfect for me
I hate that you're perfect, you're perfect for me

[Verse 2]
What good are words
When they always just get in our way?
And it hurts the most just to know
That you don't feel the same, the same
So sometimes, I get down on my knees
And I pray things will change
But life is what happens when things
They don't work out our way, our way

[Pre-Chorus]
So I spend all my nights in the dark and afraid, hmm
'Cause I've tried to forget you
But these things just don't go away, away

[Chorus]
I hate that you're perfect, perfect for me
If I didn't know better, then I would believe
We were made for each other, but I'd know the truth
You're no good for me, I'm no good for you
And I hate that you're perfect, you're perfect for me (Oh yeah, hey)
I hate that you're perfect, you're perfect for me

Do you wanna know a secret unknown?
But you'll never keep your promise
Try to keep it simple for you (La la)
High up in the clouds like you're so special
Like you never heard that before
Gotta break it to you gentle
But maybe I thought, maybe
Maybe I won't be the nice guy for once
(You past the point of my graces)

[Pre-Chorus]
You think you're so cool
Acting like a fucking dude
Words spilling out like a fool (I feel sorry for you)

[Chorus]
Don't call me your sweetheart
Actually, don't call me at all
Bury that girl in the backyard
Betcha didn't think I'd take you that far
Don't call me a sweetheart

Bury that girl in the backyard
Betcha didn't think I'd take you that far

Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh I believe in yesterday

Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh yesterday came suddenly

Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh I believe in yesterday

Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh I believe in yesterday

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
From the beginning it was ending
We were emotionally pending
Jeopardy, second guessing
Got all the questions to my answers

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & Ski Mask the Slump God]
Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
I'm only right here for your consumption
Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
Lookin' like it's turnin' into something (Yup, yup, yup, yup)

[Verse 2: Ski Mask the Slump God & Justin Bieber]
Huh, well okay
Told her that it's going down like that lace (Wee-ooh, wee-ooh, ooh)
Before I eat her for dinner, I say grace
Kickin' it with her, I resemble a sensei
Mistakes that I've made
Made my bed, I lay my head in it (Wee-ooh, wee-ooh, ooh)
So save your breath, no need to explainin' it
Because I need that
Old love, like the Adam and Eve
Like something before BC
Baby, we should have a toast to us
Yes, the both of us, because our love is the bees knees
Without you, it's insanity, would scream profanity
But Justin told me, "Keep it PG"
I see you, me on my BB
Simons belt shinin' on 'em down to Waikiki (Okay)
Tuesday, huh, it feel like Friday when you met me, huh
We was bumping Kodak on the interstate, huh
You can tell me and her have exquisite taste, huh
That's my little baby

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
I'm only right here for your consumption
Keep runnin' over me with your lovin'
Lookin' like it's turnin' into something

[Outro: Justin Bieber]
Wee-ooh, wee-ooh, ooh
Wee-ooh, wee-ooh, ooh
You can dance
Every dance with the guy
Who gave you the eye
Let him hold you tight

You can smile
Every smile for the man
Who held your hand
'Neath the pale moonlight

But don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin'
Save the last dance for me, mmm

Oh I know
That the music is fine
Like sparkling wine
Go and have your fun

Laugh and sing
But while we're apart
Don't give your heart
To anyone
But don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin'
Save the last dance for me, mmm

Baby don't you know I love you so?
Can't you feel it when we touch?
I will never, never let you go
I love you oh so much

You can dance
Go and carry on
Till the night is gone
And it's time to go

If he asks
If you're all alone
Can he take you home
You must tell him no

Cause don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin'
Save the last dance for me

Cause don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin'
Save the last dance for me, mmm
Save the last dance for me, mmm
Save the last dance for me

Jojo, Loretta
Get back, get together
Get back home
Oh, we got to get together

(Laughing)
Get back, yeah

Mama waiting for you Loretta
Get back and put on your high heel sweater, yeah
Well I know you heard of Suzy-Q
And I know you heard of the chicken too
I know you heard of the cha-cha-choo
Cause the walk is a dance that you can do
You just walk, you just walk
Oh you walk, yes you walk
Yeah you walk, it has to walk
Well I know you heard of the Texas Hop
I know you heard of the old Fox Trot
But when you do The Walk
You ride each car
You just shake your hips and close your eyes
And then you walk, yeah you walk
Then you walk, oh you walk, ah you walk
Oh yes you walk
Do the walk, boys!

[Instrumental]
Well I know you heard of the old mambo
And I know you heard of the old congo
But when you do the walk
You're startin to get close
And don't step on your partners toes!
You just walk, yeah you walk, then you walk
Yes you walk, oh you walk, just the walk
Now if you don't know what it's all about
Come to me and I'll show you how
Well do it fast, well do it slow
Then you'll know the walk everywhere you go
You can walk, and you walk, now you walk
You gonna walk, you gotta walk it
Just a walk
Just a walk
Just a walk
Just a walk
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be. Yeah
There will be an answer, let it be

And when the night is cloudy
There is still a light that shines on me
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
I dig a pony
Well, you can celebrate anything you want
Yes, you can celebrate anything you want
Oh

I do a road hog
Well, you can penetrate any place you go
Yes, you can penetrate any place you go
I told you so

All I want is you
Everything has got to be just like you want it to
Because

I pick a moon dog
Well, you can radiate everything you are
Yes, you can radiate everything you are
Oh now

I roll a stoney
Well, you can imitate everyone you know
Yes, you can imitate everyone you know
I told you so
All I want is you
Everything has got to be just like you want it to
Because (woo)
Oh now

I feel the wind blow
Well, you can indicate everything you see
Yes, you can indicate everything you see
Oh now

I load a lorry
Well, you can syndicate any boat you row
Yeah, you can syndicate any boat you row
I told you so

All I want is you
Everything has got to be just like you want it to
Because
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true
I love you more than ever, girl, I do

I want you in the morning, girl, I love you
I want you at the moment I feel blue
I'm living every moment, girl, for you

I've loved you from the moment, I saw you
You looked at me that's all you had to do
I feel it now, I hope you feel it too

Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true
I love you more than ever, girl, I do
I really love you

[Verse 1]
Two of us riding nowhere, spending someone's
Hard earned pay
You and me Sunday driving, not arriving
On our way back home

[Chorus]
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[Verse 2]
Two of us sending postcards, writing letters
On my wall
You and me burning matches, lifting latches
On our way back home

[Chorus]
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[Bridge]
You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

[Verse 3]
Two of us wearing raincoats, standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper, getting nowhere
On our way back home

[Chorus]
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[Bridge]
You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

[Verse 4]
Two of us wearing raincoats, standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper, getting nowhere
On our way back home

[Chorus]
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home
The long and winding road
That leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to you door

The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here
Let me know the way

Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Any way you'll never know
The many ways I've tried

But still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me standing here
A long long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here
Lead me to your door
Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Any way you'll never know
The many ways I've tried

But still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me standing here
A long long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here
Lead me to your door
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down
I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down

[Verse 1: Charli XCX]
White pills, empty hotel
Teardrop, standstill
Phone calls, kiss through windows
Whisper, "I'm true, burn through"
Your palms open up
White pills, white raindrops
Don't choke, I'm here standing still

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
'Cause I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down
I won't let you down
I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down

No, I won't let you down

[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
White pills, empty hotel
Good girl, don't tell
I feel like I've been here before
No one to say they hate me, no one at all
She says she couldn't save me
Said she'll never call

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
'Cause I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down
I won't let you down
I won't let you down
No, I won't let you down
I promise, I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise, I promise
I promise, I promise, I promise
No, I won't let you down

[Bridge: Lil Peep]
I know, it's so easy to blame me, the blame I take it all
(The blame I take it all)
White pills, empty hotels
I'm not staying strong (I'm not staying strong)
Give it up for you (Give it up for you)
Give it up for me (Give it up for me)
I promise, I'll be fine, but tonight I'm taking three

[Chorus: Charli XCX]
'Cause I won't let you down

You're my champagne
You make me pop off everywhere like confetti (Yeah)
I know it seems strange

Got a new job, for a big bag
You better go get it
You'll be gone for a few days, posin' in the heat
I ain't gon' sweat it
I miss your distractions
My touch is in distress
You're just a plane ride away from my permanent visit

[Pre-Chorus]
And I gotta fly out (Ha)
Hate you got me strung-out (Ha)
And I gotta fly out (Ha)
Only been an hour but I'm feelin' all alone

You should be hoppin' on the red-eye (Right now)

Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

[Verse 2]
When all the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
But though they may be parted there is
Still a chance for that to see
There will be an answer, let it be

[Chorus]
Oh, let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
Yeah, let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

[Verse 3]
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be

[Chorus]
Yeah, let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
Oh, let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
Yeah, oh let it be, let it be

[Spoken Word: John Lennon]
I think that was rather grand
I'd take one home with me
Okay lets track it
You bounder! You cheat!

[Verse 1]
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

[Verse 2]
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free

[Chorus]
Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

[Chorus]
Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night

[Outro]
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

[Intro: Studio Chatter (Paul McCartney and John Lennon)]
From the heart of the black country
When I was a robber
In Boston place
You gathered 'round me
With your fine embrace

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Hey Jude, don’t make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it’s a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
Mmm, hey Jude, don't let me down
She has found you, go out and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it
Better better better better

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

[Verse 4: Paul McCartney]
Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
Better better better better better, oh

[Outro: Paul McCartney]
Yeah, na na na na na na, na na na na, yeah Jude, yeah
Naa, na na na na na na, uh make it Jude!
Na na na na, hey Jude, hey Jude, yeah
Naa, na na na na na na, uh make it Jude!
Na na na na, hey Jude, ooh ooh, yeah
Na na na na na, na na na na, oh yeah!
Na na na na na na na, Jude!

[Verse 1]
Rosalía's hot, Beyoncé took us all on safari
We obsessed by BTS, HER, and Lewis Capaldi
Jonas Brothers return
Billie and Phineas
Camila like Shawn, they call her señorita
Ariana went next
Tyler brought us "Igor"
Lil Nas rode that road 'til he couldn't no more."

[Chorus]
It's the Grammys, Gonna have a ball
And here's Alicia Keys
To get you through it all
If you like country
Or you prefer Young Thug
Imma getcha kinda used to hearing music you love...

[Verse 2]
Commander in chief impeached, y'all
Get out, get Cardi B in
Cause music changes the world
Just like Beethoven said
Old dude had a wig
But I still give him some cred
It's just too many lies
Too much hate, too much spin
It's when good people do nothing that the bad guys win...

[Chorus]
But it's the Grammys
Ten thousand hours long
So keep the speeches short
And go for one more song
To all my overkills
And all my underdogs
Imma getcha kind of used to knowing music is love."

[Verse 1]
I would be complex, I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd be a fearless leader
I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya
What's that like?

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man

[Verse 2]
They'd say I hustled, put in the work
They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, or if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves

[Pre-Chorus]
And they would toast to me, oh
Let the players play
I'd be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man, yeah

[Bridge]
What's it like to brag about raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models?
And it's all good if you're bad
It's okay if you're mad
If I was out flashing my dollars
I'd be a bitch, not a baller
They'd paint me out to be bad
So, it's okay that I'm mad

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
You know that I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man, yeah
Yeah, I'd be the man, yeah
Oh, I'd be the man
I'd be the man

[Outro]
If I was a man
Then I'd be the man

[Verse 1]
I see her online
All the time
I'm trying not to stare down there
While she talks about her tough time
Girl of your dreams
You know what I mean
There's something 'bout her stare that makes you nervous
And you say things that you don't mean

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I found a hotel, I called up the twins
It's seven in the morning, so they won't let me in
I need to get back, I've gotta see the girl on the screen
(And then I spoke to her and she said)

[Chorus]
"Maybe I would like you better if you took off your clothes
I'm not playing with you, baby, I think that you should give it a go"
She said, "Maybe I would like you better if you took off your clothes
I wanna see and stop thinking, if you're too shy, then let me
Too shy, then let me know"

[Verse 2]
I've been wearing nothing every time I call you
And I'm starting to feel weird about it
Sometimes, it's better if you think about
This time, I think I'm gonna drink through it
Then I see her online, and I don't think that I should be calling
All the time, I just wanted a happy ending
And I pretend that I don't care about her stare
While she's giving me a tough time

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I found a motel, it looked like the bins
I think there'd been a murder, so we couldn't get in
I need to get back, I've gotta see the girl on the screen

[Chorus]
"Maybe I would like you better if you took off your clothes
I'm not playing with you, baby, I think that you should give it a go"
She said, "Maybe I would like you better if you took off your clothes
I wanna see and stop thinking, if you're too shy, then let me
Too shy, then let me know (You're too shy, then let me)
Well, if you're too shy, then let me know (Too shy, then let me)
If you're too shy, then let me go" (Oh, yeah)

[Bridge]
I see her online
All the time

[Chorus]
Well, she said, "Maybe I would like you better if you took off your clothes
I'm not playing with you, baby, I think that you should give it a go"
She said, "Maybe I would like you better if you took off your clothes
I wanna see and stop thinking, if you're too shy, then let me
Too shy, then let me know"

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

[Intro]
If you don't wanna see me

[Verse 1]
Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

[Chorus]
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

[Verse 2]
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
(Don't, don't, don't)

[Chorus]
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now ('Bout me now, 'bout me)

[Bridge]
Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Don't start now (Oh)
Up, up
Don't come out, out
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

[Chorus]
Don't show up (Don't show up), don't come out (Don't come out)
Don't start caring about me now ('Bout me now)
Walk away (Walk away), you know how (You know how)
Don't start caring about me now (So)

[Outro]
Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Walk away, walk away (So)
Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Walk away, walk away, oh
Just when you thought it was over, haha, yeah
Walk away, walk away, oh

[Verse]
Uh, uh (Incredible)
Diss Beezy, body in lake placid
Spit rapid, bitch, I'm so savage
If a nigga want it I will let a nigga have it
What the fuck you talkin' 'bout? I got the right tactics
Bitch, quit (Bitch, quit) - you on my shit list
Five-four of my goons to put your head on my hit list
Word around town I rip your whole clique defenseless
Every nigga in your fuckin' squad is a bitch-nigga
All y'all niggas stupid and dumb
Take the motherfuckin' machete and go and chop off your arm
Word around town I'm hot, go and ring the alarm
Every fuckin' song I did on, bitch, I'm droppin' a bomb
Nigga, pistol to your momma mouth, please remain calm (Please remain calm)
Fuck your stupid-ass comments, all y'all clique remain dumb
Y'all niggas fuckin' with us, y'all bitch remain on
And a million-dollar soul and I still remain sung
So (Incredible)
Bitch, it's clearly evident, I'm too cocky and relevant
And too fuckin' intelligent, you niggas celibate (Celibate)
I'll kill y'all niggas, man, I don't fear y'all niggas
I'll disappear y'all niggas, chop off the ear y'all niggas
I can't hear y'all niggas (Can't hear y'all niggas)
Word around town my clique, man, we stack six figures (We stack six figures)
Word around town y'all niggas fake, ain't none real
Bitch, a chopper to your breath, is you niggas for real? (Is you niggas for real?)
What the fuck you talkin'? I spark up like a pop tart
S.O.D. Gang, we gettin' money like a yacht club
Which one of y'all can fuck with me?
I'm too fuckin' new and my jeans cost sixty
Man, I'm deep in the game, my empire with desire for
Each and every lame-ass rapper to retire
And when I hit the microphone I leave that shit on fire
It's Soulja Boy Tell 'Em, bitch, I swear you niggas fired now
Nigga, who's better? Please, tell me who's better
I'm in the fuckin' mall Hollister my sweater there
No one better there, no one clever
I'm changing they weather, can't hold like Mayweather, it's
When I leave the game I bet everybody miss me
My dick get hard when a pussy-nigga diss me
Bitch, whatever - I'm ready for whatever, bitch
I'm ready for the pressure, bitch
Go and put it on my schedule, bitch
Bitch, and I'm not hesitant
Everybody think G stand for gangsta, bitch, that's growth and development
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em, man, tell 'em where, tell 'em where the fuck the money at
Twenty million for the hell of it
Check the Gucci jeans, the pockets got a big bulge (Big bulge)
Check my name, the charts, I got a big buzz
Bullshit and ignorance I don't indulge
Soulja Boy ain't got no money, that's a insult
Say fuck me your career is over is the result
I give a fuck, that chopper gon' hit you, nigga, go ahead and buck
I see money, my eyes is green like Incredible Hulk
The choppers is poppin', the bodies is droppin', the dollars is coppin', incredible war

[Verse 1]
You left me bleeding out when I was down, I had to heal myself
Got a lot of friends, but I feel alone, only one I hear is myself
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, not a single soul I can tell
I look around, I got everything, but I'm still livin' in hell
Uh, talkin' to the voices in my head, let 'em tell it, I'd be better dead
Pour a cup of my problems out and I smoke a zip of my regrets
M.O.B., money over sex 'til I D-I-E, boy, I need my checks
Walkin' out on me cut deep, I've been scarred since the day you left

[Chorus]
I'm over waiting on you
I told you, I'm over waiting on you
You can have it your way
Yeah, you don't have a place in my heart no more
It's time to go separate ways
'Cause I'm over waiting on you, yeah

[Verse 2]
Cuts too deep for a Band-Aid, with my new bitch thinkin' old things
'Cause after how you left me, I won't ever trust these bitches again
Paranoia on my mind, I can't help it, I won't change
Ben Frank' the only one I know in this whole world that won't fail
Runnin' and runnin' in circles with you, you keep on doing the same shit again
I swear that you left me no other choice, I cannot look at these bitches the same
I cannot look at all bitches the same, when I take your heart, know I'm taking your name
And the way that you ran my heart into the grave, I guess I have to charge it to the game

[Chorus]
I'm over waiting on you
I told you, I'm over waiting on you
You can have it your way
Yeah, you don't have a place in my heart no more
It's time to go separate ways
'Cause I'm over waiting on you

[Verse 1]
I hopped off the plane at LAX
With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess (Whoa)
Am I gonna fit in?
Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time
Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous

[Pre-Chorus]
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And a JAY-Z song was on
And a JAY-Z song was on
And a JAY-Z song was on

[Chorus]
So I put my hands up
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, yeah
Movin' my hips like, yeah
Got my hands up, they're playing my song
They know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A

[Verse 2]
Get to the club in my taxi cab
Everybody's lookin' at me now
Like, "Who's that chick that's rockin' kicks?
She gotta be from out of town"
So hard with my girls not around me
It's definitely not a Nashville party
'Cause all I see are stilettos
I guess I never got the memo

[Pre-Chorus]
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on
And a Britney song was on

[Chorus]
So I put my hands up
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, yeah
Movin' my hips like, yeah
Got my hands up, they're playing my song
They know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A

[Bridge]
Feel like hopping on a flight (On a flight)
Back to my hometown tonight (Town tonight)
Something stops me every time (Every time)
The DJ plays my song and I feel alright

[Chorus]
So I put my hands up
They're playing my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, yeah (N-n-n-noddin' my head)
Movin' my hips like, yeah (Ooh, yeah)
Got my hands up, they're playing my song
They know I'm gonna be okay (Gonna be okay)
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A
So I put my hands up
They're playing my song, the butterflies fly away (Flying away)
I'm noddin' my head like, 'yeah' (Noddin' my head like, yeah)
Movin' my hips like, 'yeah' (Movin' my hips like, yeah)
Got my hands up, they're playing my song
They know I'm gonna be okay (I'm gonna be okay)
Yeah (Yeah), it's a party in the U.S.A
Yeah (Ha-ha-ha-ha), it's a party in the U.S.A

[Verse 1]
My friends are calling, since the morning
They've been blowin' my phone
I've been busy gettin' busy for I don't know how long
They think I'm missin'
But the only thing missin' is my clothes (Ooh)
My clothes (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, body on a body
It's Heaven in between the sheets
Touchin' you when you're touchin' me
And you make me say "Ooh", we don't care about it
We don't care what time it is
We'll never quit, it's unlimited, ooh
Let's get it now (Ow!)

[Chorus]
No sleep, baby, 25/8 (Yeah)
Lights off, all night, all day (Uh-huh)
No clocks 'cause I like it that way
To hell with 24, just give me more

Lights off, all night, all day (Uh-huh)
No clocks 'cause I like it that way
To hell with 24, just give me more

25/8, 25/8
25/8, 25/8
25/8, 25/8
25/8, 25/8

[Verse 2]
Call it insomnia, but this is just the thing that I like
'Cause when you're on me, I get hungry, got a big appetite
Wanna feel the rush, runnin' through my blood
Baby, don't open the blinds (Ooh)
All night (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, body on a body
It's Heaven in between the sheets
Touchin' you when you're touchin' me
And you make me say "Ooh", we don't care about it
We don't care what time it is
We'll never quit, it's unlimited, ooh
Let's get it now (Ow!)

[Chorus]
No sleep, baby, 25/8 (Yeah)

To hell with 24, just give me more

[Bridge]
I gon' need all the extra hours
You and me all up in this room
You gon' need all the extra power
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom
We gon' need all the extra hours
To do the things I want to do
We gon' need all the extra power
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom (Zoom, zoom)

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, body on a body
It's Heaven in between the sheets
Touchin' you when you're touchin' me
And you make me say "Ooh", we don't care about it
We don't care what time it is
We'll never quit, it's unlimited, ooh
Let's get it now (Ow!)

[Chorus]
No sleep, baby, 25/8 (Yeah)

[Intro]
Canceled, can-canceled
Canceled, can-canceled

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]

[Non-Lyrical Vocals]
And she may not, going
And she falling in my lap
And then I say oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You got me gone
Never coming back

[Non-Lyrical Vocals]
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Non-Lyrical Vocals]
And this ain't no thang
Same old thang that I got

[Non-Lyrical Vocals]

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
It's what you do somethings that drive me up a wall (Ooh)
And I hate you, then I love you
And I hate you, then I love you
Sometimes we doing fine then you're pissing me off (Ooh)
And I hate you, then I love you
And I hate you, then I love you, love you

[Verse 2: Kevin McCall]
Ooh, you make me say
Ooh, I hate you, babe
'Cause one minute we're all other each other
The next minute, you drive me crazy
What's up with all of this back and forth?
This can't be love
We need to get back on course

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
It's what you do somethings that drive me up a wall (Ooh)
And I hate you, then I love you
And I hate you, then I love you
Sometimes we doing fine then you're pissing me off (Ooh)
And I hate you, then I love you
And I hate you, then I love you, love you
On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway;
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
'this could be heaven or this could be hell'
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say...

Welcome to the hotel california
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the hotel california
Any time of year, you can find it here

Her mind is tiffany-twisted, she got the mercedes bends
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
So I called up the captain
'please bring me my wine'
He said, 'we haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine'
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say...

Welcome to the hotel california
Such a lovely place
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the hotel california
What a nice surprise, bring your alibis

Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said 'we are all just prisoners here, of our own device'
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
The stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
'relax,' said the night man
We are programmed to receive
You can checkout any time you like
But you can never leave!

[Intro: Britney Spears]
It's Britney, bitch
I see you

[Pre-Chorus: Britney Spears]
We can get down like there's no one around

Even when we're up against the wall
You got me in a crazy position (Yeah)
If you're on a mission (Uh-huh)
You got my permission (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus: Britney Spears]
We can get down like there's no one around

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Bitch, I'm in the buildin', guarantee that it's an emergency
Stompin' like a stampede, so I know you bitches heard of me
I'm straight from Virginia, but this ain't common courtesy
Fuck your feelings, I take your feelings' virginity
Million dollars for a show, got a nigga ballin'
I think my phone tapped 'cause my money steady callin'
Every other day, I'm in and out the office
And my soup killin' niggas, need a fuckin' coffin
I'm bossin', if I gotta take it off, I'm a warrior
Known for buyin' big shit, call me notorious
Kill that pussy, ain't no secret, I'm victorious
With all these Columbianas and Eva Longoria, haha
Now I done made a million down in Cancún
I keep shittin' on niggas, need a bathroom
I got my yacht in the water
If it's sharks in the water
It don't matter, I'm killin' 'em with this harpoon
Ha, these niggas, they ain't my friends
They party with me, party with me
But at the same time, they tryna fuck my bitch
And I don't care 'bout them fuck niggas
Never get on my high horse
Ain't ride out with these fuck niggas
This life I got, I die for it

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
Oh dawg, for this shit, man, I swear to God
All my niggas in the club, we about to mob
Mob with it (Mob with it)
Mob with it (Mob with it)
If you on the floor, nigga, better have a mob
Mob with it (Mob with it)
Mob with it (Mob with it)
All of my niggas runnin' deep, we a fuckin' mob
We mobbin' (Mobbin')
We mobbin' (Mobbin')
Holla at us if you want that problem

[Verse 2: Kevin McCall]
First niggas was ballin', now we slam dunkin'
Arms out of school like I'm ridin' in the bunky
That's C Breezy with it, he pushin' my shit
We swapped them out, just like we do the bitches
New to this, I hear they blowin' money like a swisher
Used to be on county, now my taxes six figures
Said my dick conceited, can my head get any bigger?
Then I told her to lick it and blow it, just like it's a swisher
I'm that nigga, I'm that fuckin' nigga
Is that your baby mama? She gon' need a baby sitter
'Cause once I get her, I'ma be all up in her
You fuck with the tip, then I'ma eat her like she dinner
Californication got a nigga faded
I see why a pussy nigga and the bitch related
Too sweet, soft nigga, I'ma call you Danish
I know you see this camera section, bitch, a nigga famous
Girl, I better kill that pussy like a vet
Not like veteran, but I mean veterinarian, I kill the cat
If you a paper chaser, I got them racks on top of racks
Shake your money maker, I got a hunnid
K-K-K-K-K-Mac

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
Oh dawg, for this shit, man, I swear to God
All my niggas in the club, we about to mob

This is how, that's how The Carnival began
Before I had a Fugee deal
I was signed to a house label under Craig Kallman
This is how, that's how The Carnival began
Before I had a Fugee deal
I was signed to a house label under Craig Kallman

[Verse 1]
R.I.P. to the legend Heavy D
I was barely seventeen when I heard this beat (Ooh)
Up town when I used to shop at the mall
(Please listen to my demo)
Big beat, flex the chest
Random club to tell 'em how to heat
Used to creep with a fake ID
Like kids tryin' to get in to see Avicii
Jersey house, Zanzibar
Club Eighty-Eight, Garden State
Used to break, pop that lock
I wish we found love before my man got shot

[Chorus]
Now that we found love what are we gonna do?
(What are we gonna do?) With it
(What are we gonna do with it?)
Now that we found love what are we gonna do?
With it
(Now that we found love)
Now that we found love what are we gonna do?

Now that we found love what are we gonna do?

[Verse 2]
It's 

[?] try to do the right thing
Touch my box radio right here
Can't live without the music
Like you can't live without your iPhone
Every minute, every second
Gotta send a text
Well, I gotta send a cock
To my people in the box
Everything gonna be all right, all right
Keep your head in the move
Five out of ten then you're coming home soon
What we gonna do when you get outta prison?
We gonna do a remix
Puff that dragon
And that's what I call love
Come on over, give me a bear hug

[Chorus]
Now that we found love what are we gonna do?
(What are we gonna do?) With it
(What are we gonna do with it?)
Now that we found love what are we gonna do?
With it
(Now that we found love)
Now that we found love what are we gonna do?
(What are we gonna do?) With it
(What are we gonna do with it?)
Now that we found love what are we gonna do?
With it
(Now that we found love)

[Verse 3]
I got a five-piece band
And I'm back on the road
That's my DJ, go, go
Drummer man, keep it funky
Bass man, third world, Bob Marley
Shorty on the keys, man sound like Alicia
And my little sister wail like Aretha
Yeah, and when you see me at the live show
You better do the humpty-hump like Digital
Underground, two parks
I’m a Jonas brother
Hip house
This is those men that used to wear high tops
Who forfeit their rings and we met at the club spot

[Chorus]
Now that we found love what are we gonna do?
(What are we gonna do?) With it
(What are we gonna do with it?)
Now that we found love what are we gonna do?
With it
(Now that we found love)
Now that we found love what are we gonna do?
(What are we gonna do?) With it

Now that we found love what are we gonna do?
With it

[Intro]
All over, deep under my skin
You got me so emotional
We had somethin' that never happened
If only we had lost control

[Verse 1]
Both got the feelin’
Hit like karate
Had boyfriends and girlfriends
We wanted to touch, but we could never make any moves
Both got the feelin’
Guilty desire
Your body, my body
We were close, but still so far away

[Pre-Chorus]
When the lights go out, when the lights go out
Will you be there?
When I lay you down, when I lay you down
Down in my bed
Tellin’ right from wrong, tellin’ right from wrong
All this self control is so emotional
Yeah, it’s so emotional

[Chorus]
All over, deep under my skin
You got me so emotional
We had somethin' that never happened
If only we had lost control
Oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional

[Verse 2]
The car in the driveway
The questions in her mouth
This secret is risky
So we have to keep all these fantasies to ourselves
Clothes on the carpet
Over at my house
I wish we could do it
We came so close, but still we push away

[Pre-Chorus]
When the lights go out, when the lights go out
Will you be there?
When I lay you down, when I lay you down
Down in my bed
Tellin’ right from wrong, tellin’ right from wrong
All this self control is so emotional
Yeah, it’s so emotional

[Chorus]
All over
Deep under my skin
You got me so emotional
We had somethin' that never happened
If only we had lost control
Oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
When the lights go out, when the lights go out
Will you be there?
When I lay you down, when I lay you down
Down in my bed
Tellin’ right from wrong, tellin’ right from wrong
All this self control is so emotional
Yeah, it’s so emotional

[Chorus]
All over
Deep under my skin
You got me so emotional
We had somethin' that never happened
If only we had lost control
Oh-oh-oh-oh, so emotional

[Intro]
Yeah
A love song
In the key of Lex Luger
Deeper than pink

[Verse 1]
I didn't even mean to break your heart
So lemme put it back together
It's funny 'cause I kinda thought that this would last forever
I been goin' through the pain, miss when this was at it's pleasure
"I love you" sounded better then, now it's just repetitive
Sippin' on codeine, girl, that's my sedative
'Cause I can't sleep alone
When you needed me at home, I wasn't there
Fightin', yellin', you tellin' me, "Nothing's fair"
Girl, I got a heart of gold, and trust me, there's enough to share
Chillin' in your underwear, we gon' do some fuckin', yeah
And after that I'll tell you how I'm so in love with you
Lay on top your comforter, fuckin' 'til the sun come up
Bubble butt, smack you on the ass after I bust a nut
Don't call you, "Honey,"  but you sweeter than the candy
After Halloween and Valentine's Day, both put together
You never gon' find one better
This love for you last forever
Incredible, take you to festivals
When you in bed, fixin' your hair
You know that I love it curly
I love it when you wake up in the mornin'
And if it's early, we may fuck a little
Take her ass to sleep

[Refrain]
I like what I see, I hope she take a likin' to me (Hey)

[Chorus]
My drink is deeper than pink, but she hate that
Wanna smack me in my face, be like, "Take that," haha
But she been my girl since way back
And I don't think it's ever gon' change
My drink is deeper than pink, but she hate that
She can roll up all my weed, tell me, "Face that," haha
She been my girl since way back
But still, I don't ever wanna change that

[Verse 2]
My drink is deeper than pink and she hate that
She love to talk to stray cats
Find an address written on their name tag
She innocent but smart as well
Deadly as the harm she felt
She either tell you, "All is well," or "Rot in hell"
All depends on how you wanna treat her, so I try my best
But, bein' who I am will have her all upset
And I don't know what I should do
'Cause I been born to make these moves
I just hope that I can fix her with a call or text
All unless, it's complex and difficult
Tryna figure out if it isn't or it is my fault
She keeps to herself, locked somewhere deep down in the vault
Place I haven't been at all
Where the strong survive and the cripple fall
Here, let's talk out in the hall
I just wanna know what's on your mind
Not only 'cause I love you, but I'm interested to find
What's behind those two eyes

[Refrain]
I like what I see, I hope you take a likin' to me (Hey)

[Chorus]
My drink is deeper than pink, but she hate that
Wanna smack me in my face, be like, "Take that," haha
But she been my girl since way back
And I don't think it's ever gon' change
My drink is deeper than pink, but she hate that
She can roll up all my weed, tell me, "Face that," haha
She been my girl since way back
But still, I don't ever wanna change that
My drink is deeper than pink, but she hate that
Wanna smack me in my face, be like, "Take that," haha
But she been my girl since way back
And I don't think it's ever gon' change
My drink is deeper than pink, but she hate that
She can roll up all my weed, tell me, "Face that," haha
She been my girl since way back
But still, I don't ever wanna change that
She said she just talking you don't hear a damn
I just mind my business you should do the same
I'm the reason why you been heated on the flames
I know I hurt you so much you just trying to hurt my name

[Chorus]
I'ma put my niggas where my heart go (Heart go)
Burner by the car door
Also the torso, point it at your cornrows (Cornrows)
Shoot  'em where his thoughts go (Bah)
What you said? I thought so
You don't wanna spark woe (Nope)
'Cause I'm feeling like charcoal (Ayy)
I'm feeling like a lost soul
Boy, I'm in war mode (War mode)
Highway to Heaven, nigga (Errp)
I can take you off-road

[Verse 1]
Even though I'm way up, I still finesse (I still finesse), yeah
Even though I'm prayed up, I feel possessed (Dang)
I don't know, man, it's like lately (Lately), I ain't been myself (Nope)
I looked into the mirror and I see somebody else
I don't recognize the face that I wear (Damn)
I look into my eyes and ain't nobody there and I'm sleeping with a bitch I don't know (Who is you?)
She sleeping with the dick down her throat, oh lord
What if some niggas kick down the door?
I shoot it out then hide behind the ho
Nigga, what? I'm living like that, yeah
Nigga, what? I'm living like that, yeah (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Nigga, what? You can die like that
Don't try like that
Sour grapes, nigga, 'cause you whine like brats
I don't see these niggas 'cause they shine like black
I'ma throw some bullets in the sky, nice catch
In the sky blue 'vette repping Piru set (Suwoop)
Hop up out that bitch like Batman (Yeah)
You get a toe tag quicker than a hashtag (Haha)
I cut his feet off, tell that nigga tap dance
I cut his wings off, make a nigga crash land (Woo)
I need a theme song, nigga, I'm a masked man
You talk trash, nigga, only to the trash man (Yeah)
These pussycat niggas need a CAT scan (Yeah)
I'm a mob boss asking what the crime cost (Yeah)
On my high horse seeing who I can buy off (Yeah)
Got a chauffeur somewhere up in my garage lost
Got some codeine poured up for a dry cough
Nigga, I'm living like that (Pour up), yeah
Nigga. what? I'm sipping like that (Pour up), yeah

[Verse 3]
Lord, they can take me away, carry me in the wind
Bury me with a grin
Salary may offend
Now a bad-ass bitch sharing me with her friend
And I started from the bottom like a tree with a stem (Woo)
Now I feel like 50 Cent 'cause I see many men
Wish death upon me like a genie with them
But I put the burner barrel to his beanie and brim
And leave a blood pool, put on your bikini and swim (Woo)
Motherfucker, don't try, don't you even attempt (Yeah)
I don't even want beef, I want linguine and shrimp
Lamborghinis and martinis and a suite full of nymphs
Fat stinky backwood, a swisher sweet with some length, boy
And when it's them I got the heat with the "nth" (Yeah)
Magazine extend, and my Nina a twin
I don't know two other bad sisters meaner than them
I call them Venus and Serena, they hyena your limbs
And we livin' like that, yeah (Yeah)
Nigga, what? You could get it like that (Like that, nigga), yeah

[Chorus]
I'ma put my niggas where my heart go (Heart go)
Burner by the car door (Car door)
Also the torso, point it at your cornrows (Cornrows)
Shoot 'em where his thoughts go (Bah)
What you said? I thought so
You don't wanna spark woe
'Cause I'm feeling like charcoal (Ayy)
I'm feeling like a lost soul
Boy, I'm in war mode (War mode)
Highway to Heaven, nigga
I can take you off-road, I can take you off-road
Woah
Welcome to the crossroads
Woah, yeah

[Outro]
See, one thing about me, nigga
I don't give two fucks about these niggas
I'm three ticks from bombing, nigga
I'm four sips from drowning, nigga
I'm five star if you're counting, nigga
Tunechi

[Verse 1]
Thought I almost died in my dream again (Baby, almost died)
Fightin' for my life, I couldn't breathe again
I'm fallin' in too deep (Oh, oh)
Without you, I can't sleep (Fallin' in)
'Cause my heart belongs to you
I'll risk it all for you
I want you next to me
This time, I'll never leave
I wanna share babies
Protection, we won't need
Your body next to me
Is just a memory
I'm fallin' in too deep, oh
Without you, I can't sleep
Insomnia relieve, oh
Talk to me, without you, I can't breathe

[Verse 2]
My darkest hours
Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room
Different girls on the floor, distractin' my thoughts of you
I turned into the man I used to be, to be
Put myself to sleep
Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams
Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me
I just wanted to call you and say, and say

[Chorus]
Oh, baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart

[Verse 3]
Never comin' down, uh
I was running away from facin' reality, uh
Wastin' all of my time out living my fantasies
Spendin' money to compensate, compensate
'Cause I want you, baby, uh
I be livin' in heaven when I'm inside of you
It was simply a blessing wakin' beside you
I'll never let you down again, again

[Chorus]
Oh, baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
I said, baby
I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
This time, I won't break your heart, your heart, yeah

[Bridge]
I know it's all my fault
Made you put down your guard
I know I made you fall
Then said you were wrong for me
I lied to you, I lied to you, I lied to you (To you)
Can't hide the truth, I'd stay with her in spite of you
You did some things that you regret, still ride for you
'Cause this house is not a home

[Chorus]
Without my baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I gave it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
And I said, baby
I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
This time, I won't break your heart, your heart, no

[Intro]
What is this feeling I can't control?
Am I dying and I don't know?
Is this the end or
Am I just cold?
My heart is frozen, he chilled me to the bone

[Verse 1]
Now I, I am the one who kills
Don't think I can? I will
A lion and its prey
I'm waiting for the time to pounce, okay
Cover it up with paint
Smile and play the saint
I'm coming for your throat
Point and aim and

[Chorus]
Watch it go down in flames
I'm just a bit insane
If this is what love is, I want all of it
Subscribe me to the pain
Who says that playing nice
Is always the best advice?
Sometimes the only cure for the lonely pays the price

[Bridge]
Oh no
I've lost my feet again
In this dirty, dirty world, I slip again
Who am I?
Do I cry for them?
Are we all just walking sinners?
Do we all just get condemned?

[Verse 2]
Now I, I am the one who kills
Don't think I can, I will
Take my hand
And we'll sit in the sand

[Chorus]
And watch it go down in flames
I'm just a bit insane
If this is what love is
I want none of it, take away the pain
Who says that playing nice
Is always the worst advice?
Sometimes the only cure for the lonely pays the price

Oh no

[Verse]
She says to me
"Boy, do you like what you see?"
"You wanna come and take it from me?"
Put your hands on my body but don't tell nobody
And I was like, "It ain't a thing"
So, baby girl, listen to me
I'm tryna make your body scream
That's the song I wanna play when I'm lovin' you tonight, yeah

[Chorus]
This gon' be a baby maker, make you wanna scream
Girl, I know exactly what you need
Soon as the lights turn off
She told me play her song
This gon' be that baby maker, make 'em wanna holla
Anything you need, girl, I got ya
Soon as the lights turn off
She told me play her song

[Verse 1]
The grass is always greener when the fields all mine
And I'll lose my hero's journey as the years gone by
And the stories still unwritten, there's no sense of time
Oh my, oh my

[Chorus: Jordan Rakei, Frida Touray & Both]
I live out alone, no room for yourself
I'm trying to focus, It's my story to tell
I'm human as well
(As well), well
(As well), well
(As well)
I'm human as well
(As well), well
(As well), well
(As well)

[Post-Chorus: Jordan Rakei, Frida Touray & Both]
And I'm running 'round in circles
Flying high above the ground
And I'm searching out the echoes
And the signs of who we are, who we are

[Verse 2: Common]
Saints and angels, sing songs in the key of life
Moment's prisoner, tryna live a freer life
Crazy days, we coming like a thief at night
I got my peace of mind, telling me to fight
Stay with my a of light, 'cause we see a light
'Til the fire next time, I'mma need a light
To guide me so much, going on outside me
I wonder why we do the things we do
And loneliness is search of solitude
I deal with the same issues that my father do
With every molecule and cell in my body
I'm human as well but I dwell with the godly
I hardly scratch the surface of my purpose
I have money and I still felt worthless
Hope this earth tell the story of this journey of mine
On the path to the divine, still searching for signs

[Post-Chorus: Jordan Rakei, Frida Touray & Both]
And I'm running 'round in circles
Flying high above the ground
And I'm searching out the echoes
And the signs of who we are, who we are

[Outro: Jordan Rakei, Frida Touray & Both]
Who we are
Would you kindly tell me
Who we are
Trying to find the reasons for
Who we are
Someday we'll know it all

[Verse 1]
I wait here at the borderline
Always my alibi
You take what I consider mine
Offer no reasons why
Mistake deceivable in the night
Oh and the price is right, hmm hmm
Poor taste, lips to the high and now
Thought I was tryin’ to fly

[Chorus]
Fall in love, will you stay?
I’m begging you for it
We’re making up, in each way
‘Cause I’m closer to the borderline
The borderline
Fall in love, will you stay?
I’m begging you for it
We’re making up, in each way
‘Cause I’m closer to the borderline
The borderline

[Verse 2]
Your wickedness unequivocally
Undresses me similarly
Too much for my mind
You try caress but I’m seeing through your disguises
I’m seeing it all, yes with my own eyes

[Chorus]
Fall in love, will you stay?
I’m begging you for it
We’re making up, in each way
‘Cause I’m closer to the borderline
The borderline
Fall in love, will you stay?
I’m begging you for it
We’re making up, in each way
‘Cause I’m closer to the borderline
The borderline

[Bridge]
Oh it’s the time of the hour
It’s not my intention to fall
I see the problems and faults
Before it all goes sour
I run away from my demons
It seems I’m moving in circles
I’m heading into the trouble
I’m holding on to the secrets
Secrets and faults
Secrets and faults
Secrets and faults, ooh
Secrets and faults

[Chorus]
Fall in love, will you stay?
I’m begging you for it
We’re making up, in each way
‘Cause I’m closer to the borderline
The borderline
Fall in love, will you stay?
I’m begging you for it
We’re making up, in each way
‘Cause I’m closer to the borderline
The borderline

[Verse 1]
Danced on an open wide
I steadily admit it was faith
To lose but a moment's time
I hope that it doesn’t come too late
So spare me my life
I laugh to show that I am worthy of you
I know that you'll understand
So hear me as I make this request
Lend me your eyes to make me whole again
Until then you can put me to rest
Spare me my life
I laugh to show that I am worthy of you

[Chorus]
I had hoped to never be too long
Always coming
Never dream that it will carry on
Always coming
Keep your patience I'm almost there
Always coming
No more suffering, you’ll have to spare
Always coming

[Verse 2]
So often I sit confused
Saying why is this just happened to me?
Failing to shift to all the use
Making it much harder to breathe
So spare me my life
I laugh to show that I am worthy of you
Here is your secret to keep
Not telling you it's put me at ease
Praying on one last final sleep
Would take me to the roots of the tree
So spare me life
I laugh to show that I am worthy of you

[Chorus]
I had hoped to never be too long
Always coming
Never dream that it will carry on
Always coming
Keep your patience I'm almost there
Always coming
No more suffering, you'll have to spare
Always coming

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
I've been looking for a reason
I've been holding on for more
I want to something to believe in
'Cause I've lived like this too long

[Pre-Chorus]
Let the light shine down on me
Down on me
Oh, to speak
Salvation cries aloud for me
She waits to see it closely
And down by the river
Mmh, all for that place we've all been fighting on
Await the tales of encore
And soulful resolution

[Chorus]
But we can see clearly now
I'm forcing my way out
But we can see clearly now
I'm forcing my way

[Verse 2]
I've been waiting years to hold you
But we keep on passing by
I walk the streets in silence
In silence, searching through the night

[Pre-Chorus]
Let the light shine down on me
Down on me
Oh, to speak
Salvation cries aloud for me
She waits to see it closely
And down by the river
Mmh, all for that place we've all been fighting on
Await the tales of encore
And soulful resolution

[Chorus]
But we can see clearly now
I'm forcing my way out
But we can see clearly now
I'm forcing my way out
But we can see clearly now
I'm forcing my way out
But we can see clearly now
I'm forcing my way
Forcing my way

[Bridge]
I'm tryna find the words to say
To send me on my way to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, to speak
Salvation cries aloud for me
She waits to see it closely
And down by the river
Mmh, all for that place we've all been fighting on
Await the tales of encore
And soulful resolution

[Chorus]
Ohoho yeah, but we can see clearly now
I'm forcing my way out
But we can see clearly now
I'm forcing my way out
But we can see clearly now
I'm forcing my way out
But we can see clearly now
I'm forcing my way
Forcing my way

[Verse 1]
You don't know babe
When you hold me
And kiss me slowly
It's the sweetest thing
And it don't change
If I had it my way
You would know that you are

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You're the coffee that I need in the morning
You're my sunshine in the rain when it's pouring
Won't you give yourself to me
Give it all
I just wanna see

[Chorus]
I just wanna see how beautiful you are
You know that I see it
I know you're a star
Where you go I'll follow
No matter how far
If life is a movie
Oh you're the best part, oh
Then you're the best part, ooh
Best part

[Verse 2]
It's this sunrise
And those brown eyes, yes
You're the one that I desire
When we wake up
And then we make love (Make love)
It makes me feel so nice

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You're my water when I'm stuck in the desert
You're the Tylenol I take when my head hurts
You're the sunshine on my life

[Chorus]
I just wanna see how beautiful you are
You know that I see it
I know you're a star
Where you go I'll follow
No matter how far
If life is a movie
Then you're the best part, oh
You're the best part, ooh
Best part

[Outro]
If you love me, would you say something?
If you love me, would you? Hmm
If you love me, won't you say something?

[Verse 1]
These voices, all in my head
Never to whisper again
Never to sing me to sleep
Oh, but a dream
Right there, caught out in the rain
Drenched in a memory of pain
Sold by the old sour taste
Let's hope for the better

[Chorus]
Play to the mind, wide open
Awaken the beast by the meadow
Playful at least, I'm hoping
Show you the doorway to my soul

[Verse 2]
Come to the root of the cause
Producer will can the applause
I mention it's not my fault
Yet my effort was needed
So I grab for some inner resource
Most certainly blind to the force
Letting the world takes it's course
We've now superseded

[Chorus]
Play to the mind, wide open
Awaken the beast by the meadow
Playful at least, I'm hoping
Show you the doorway to my soul
Play to the mind, wide open
Awaken the beast by the meadow
Playful at least, I'm hoping
Show you the doorway to my soul

[Bridge]
Always in my brain
I'm trapped in a magical maze
Not feelings of hopelessness
It's facing the mess that I've made
Always in my brain
I'm trapped in a magical maze
Not feelings of hopelessness
It's facing the mess that I've made
Made, made, made
Made, made, made, made
Made, made, made, made
Made, made, made, made

[Instrumental Bridge]
Yeah
Ooh yeah
Oh ooh

[Chorus]
Oh, play to the mind, wide open
Awaken the beast by the meadow, uh
Playful at least, I'm hoping
Show you the doorway to my soul
Play to the mind, wide open
Awaken the beast by the meadow, uh
Playful at least, I'm hoping
Show you the doorway to my soul

[Outro]
Oh, the mind's eye
Oh, the mind's eye
Oh, the mind's eye
Oh, the mind's eye
Oh, the mind's eye
Oh, the mind's eye
Oh, the mind's eye
Oh, the mind's eye

[Instrumental Outro + Non-lyrical vocals]
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 1]
I'm hoping for a good look
I'm hoping there's some real change coming
I'm praying for a lost cause
When we are told we are not all welcome
You asked me for the real thing
I'm short on telling everyone nothing
My memories will only fade

[Pre-Chorus]
When we lose our control
It seems that this is a fantasy
Or a projection of anticipated memory
It's all in my hands to find a way
To lead me out of this place
For one last final time

[Chorus]
Just you wait and see
This time is coming for you and me, you and me
Just you wait and see
This time is coming for you and me, you and me

[Verse 2]
We talked about it years ago
We sat upon a hill of frustration
It's never been like this before
Now it all seems we are not all welcome
I tell myself another lie
That it would all seem to get better
But now it's just an eye for an eye

[Pre-Chorus]
When we lose our control
It seems that this is a fantasy
Or a projection of anticipated memory
It's all in my hands to find a way
To lead me out of this place
For one last final time

[Chorus]
Just you wait and see
This time is coming for you and me, you and me
Just you wait and see
This time is coming for you and me, you and me
Just you wait and see
This time is coming for you and me, you and me
Just you wait and see
This time is coming for you and me

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Outro]
Just you wait and see
This time is coming for you and me
Just you wait and see
This time is coming for you and me

[Verse 1]
Stay away from emotion and madness
Stay away from the streets
For me, for me
Hide away from the moment that make us
Hide away from deceit
For me, for me

[Chorus]
It's a mad world, hey
It's a mad, mad world
It's a mad world, hey
It's a mad, mad world
Why can't we keep on living here? Yeah
It's a mad, mad world
Why can't we keep on living here?
It's a mad, mad world

[Verse 2]
Stray away from the moments that make you
Stray away from deceit
For me, for me, hey, hey
Hide away from the moments of makers
Hide away from the streets
For me, uh, for me

[Chorus]
It's a mad world, hey
It's a mad, mad world
It's a mad world, hey
It's a mad, mad world
Why can't we keep on living here? Yeah
It's a mad, mad world
Why can't we keep on living here?
It's a mad, mad world
It's a mad world, hey
It's a mad, mad world
It's a mad world, hey
It's a mad, mad world
Why can't we keep on living here? Yeah
It's a mad, mad world
Why can't we keep on living here?
It's a mad, mad world

[Bridge]
It's a mad, mad world

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Outro]
It's a mad, mad world
It's a mad, mad world
It's a mad, mad world
It's a mad, mad world

[Verse]
I believe in something special
I believe in trust
I believe in us
I believe in my tradition
I believe there's love
I believe in us
I'm aware there's no tomorrow
I'm aware of yesterday
It's the sound you make
'Cause l know there's history
Let it seep through all of this misery

[Chorus]
So sing with me this lullaby
You can't say we don't try
So sing with me this lullaby
You can't say we don't try

[Verse]
I believe in something special
I believe in trust

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
So sing with me this lullaby
You can't say we don't try
So sing with me this lullaby
You can't say we don't try

[Verse 1]
In the wake of the madness
I held it until it came right, yeah
I'm looking on the bright side
While they wreaking the havoc, huh
There's no random access here
Erase what they call memory
I'll make sure they remember me
Until they disappear, oohoohoo

[Chorus]
Ooh, I'm asking permission for where I stand, stand
I don't know where to hide when said and done
Takes more than you'll ever understand
It's rolling into one

[Verse 2]
I wish I'd never seen the danger that life posed to me
Circling all around me
I hope for memories that never fade like her and he
Worshiping onto the ground, we
Fake it 'til we make it
They'll be dreaming about nothing but us
Take it 'til they break us
They'll be screaming loud, misplacing our trust, oh oh

[Chorus]
Ooh, I'm asking permission for where I stand, stand
I don't know where to hide when said and done
Takes more than you'll ever understand
It's rolling into one

Ooh, I'm asking permission for where I stand, stand
I don't know where to hide when said and done
Takes more than you'll ever understand
It's rolling into one

[Bridge]
If I had answers no one listens
I won't get down with that system
We won't run away, life long prison
Life's too short to leave it to them
Theory tells me, if we wait here
My own story serves the waitress
Full as a plate gets, empty questions
Something I can't stomach
Dress me down like naked clones that
Share their souls for cheap romantics
Less the antics, we're human here, intelligence
So as you know it's all or nothing
Show some grace or mind my loving
Souls keep swimming against the current
Show me what love is
Show me what love is
Show me what love is

[Chorus]
Ooh, I'm asking permission for where I stand, stand
I don't know where to hide when said and done
Takes more than you'll ever understand
It's rolling into one
Ooh, I'm asking permission for where I stand, stand
I don't know where to hide when said and done
Takes more than you'll ever understand
It's rolling into one

[Verse 1]
Mmm, I shut my eyes
You call but I just cut the line
I know your style
I know that you want one more night
And I'm backsliding
Into this just one more time

[Pre-Chorus]
Too far from over you
Beams from your M2
Are blowin' through my room
And now you lay down in my shoes
You dyed your hair blue
Oh, so much déjà vu
And now

[Chorus]
I can feel your love
Your temporary touch
It's a hit and run
You go back there when you're done
Don't you want some more?
'Cause I can feel your love

[Verse 2]
Mmm, that purple touch
Everyone who sees you falls in love
You eat us up
You live like you're on camera
You slide on top
A moon to all the juice in us

[Pre-Chorus]
Too far from over you
Beams from your M2
Are blowin' through my room
And now you lay down in my shoes
You dyed your hair blue
Oh, so much déjà vu
And now

[Chorus]
I can feel your love
Your temporary touch
It's a hit and run
You go back there when you're done
Don't you want some more?
'Cause I can feel your love
(Woo)

[Bridge]
Maybe in time
When we're both better at life
Daylight can open my eyes
And you'll still be by my side
But meanwhile
I've got my contact high
You've got your powdered lies
We've got these summertime nights
Night by night, I let you eat me alive
I want you to eat me alive
I want you to eat me alive
(Woo)
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Chorus]
I can feel your love
Your temporary touch
It's a hit and run
You go back there when you're done
I can feel your love
Your temporary touch
It's a hit and run
You go back there when you're done
I can feel your love
Your temporary touch
It's a hit and run
You go back there when you're done
Don't you want some more?
'Cause I can feel your love

[Outro]
I can feel your love
I can feel your love
I can feel your love
I can feel your love
I can feel your love

Hey yo, hey yo
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

[Verse 1]
I want to
I want to be someone else or I'll explode
Floating upon the surface for
The birds, the birds
The birds

[Verse 2]
You want me?
Fuckin' well come and find me
I'll be waiting
With a gun and a pack of sandwiches
And nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing

[Verse 3]
You want me?
Well, come on and break the door down
You want me?
Fuckin' come on and break the door down
I'm ready, I'm ready

I tried my best to be just like
The other boys in school
I tried my best to get it right
And died in every duel
This mountainside is suicide
This dream will never work
Still the sign upon my headstone, write
"A champion of the world"

[Interlude]
Yeah

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I tried my best to stay alight
Fly like a firework
I tried my best to stay in fight
But my rocket ship won't work
No, referee, don't stop the fight
Everyone can see I'm hurt
Still I'll stand before conquistadors
Till I'm champion of the world

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
And when I sail, I'm sailing west
Knowing I might fail, but still I'm hoping for the best
In in my dreams, onto my chest
She'll pin the colours and say:
"I wandered the whole wide world but
Baby, you're the best"

[Interlude: Chris Martin]
Lo lo-lo-lo lo oh
Ee-yo-ee-yo-ee-yo-ee-yeah
Lo lo-lo-lo lo

[Outro: Chris Martin]
So I'm flying on my bicycle
Heading upwards from the Earth
I'm jumping with no parachute
Out into the universe
I have E.T. on my bicycle
Because giving up won't work
Now I'm riding on my rocketship
And I'm champion of the world
Doo-doo-roo, doo-doo-doo-roo
Doo-roo, doo-roo, doo-roo

[Intro: Chris Martin]
Cry, cry, cry, baby
Cry, cry, cry

[Verse: Chris Martin]
In a book about the world
Called "The Luminous Things"
There are trees and flowers glowing
While Jizo Bodhisattva sings

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
When you cry, cry, cry, baby
When you cry, cry, cry
When you cry, cry, cry, baby
I'll be by your side

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
Don't want us to hurt each other (Dum-dum-dum, dum-dum-dum)
Or cause each other pain (Dum-dum-dum, dum-dum-dum)
Don't want to fear what we don't know (Dum-dum-dum, dum-dum-dum)
(Dum-dum-dum, dum-dum-dum)
We're in this together, baby (Dum-dum-dum, dum-dum-dum)
We're as singing is to rain (Dum-dum-dum, dum-dum-dum)
So I'll never, ever, ever let you go (Dum-dum-dum)

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
When you cry, cry, cry, baby
When you cry, cry, cry
When you cry, cry, cry, baby
I'll be by your side
Ooh, yeah
Ooh, yeah

[Outro: Chris Martin]
For your miracles outnumber
All the stars out in the sky
Doo-doo, doo-doo-roo-roo-roo
Alright, ooh

[Verse]
Stuntin' in a droptop Chevy
Ridin' 'round lookin' for a girl who's pretty
The thing I like, like, like
It's the thing I like, like, like

[Chorus]
Systems are a go
Be my battery (Hey, hey)
Be my battery (Hey, hey)
My ship is ready to go
And you're all I need
You're all I need, yeah

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Systems are a go
Be my battery (Hey, hey)
Be my battery (Hey, hey)
My ship is ready to go
And you're all I need
You're all I need, yeah

[Chorus]
Systems are a go
Be my battery (Hey, hey)
Be my battery (Hey, hey)
My ship is ready to go
And you're all I need
You're all I need, yeah

[Intro]
Uh, uh-uh

[Verse 1]
Why are we in Chanel talkin' 'bout life and shit?
Got my emotions on open mic and shit
Fancy, all this pink champagne on ice and shit
Off one glass, girl, I can see how nice you get

[Chorus]
Buzzin' your body, body to body
You said you're over me, now you're all over me
Buzzin' your body, body to body
You said you're over me, now you're all over me

[Verse 2]
I know, you know, I'm in too deep to let it go
I know, you know, it’s in my nature to get distant
I know it's been a year since I left you alone
Unfortunate, I think you know there's somethin' missin'
But you never say shit, don't know how to take it
We're good on our own, but
I miss being on Wiltshire at your place, and
I drink you under tables, got you misbehavin'

[Chorus]
Buzzin' in your body, body to body
You said you're over me, now you're all over me
Buzzin' in your body, body to body
You said you're over me, now you're all over me

[Verse 1]
Oh, how I wish I was back in Georgia
Maybe I want to be back in time
I've got a sweet lot of memories of another place
And a heart full of longing for another life

[Chorus]
Angel, I want to see you
Angel, I want to see you
Angel, I really want to see you
Angel, I want to see you, right now

[Verse 2]
Oh, how I wish I could see an angel
Deliver me from this dark despair
I've got a sweet lot of plans that have come to nothing
And a life that's in need of a good repair

[Chorus]
Angel, I want to see you
Angel, I really want to see you
You know I want to see you
Angel, I really want to see you, right now

[Verse 3]
Under a sky of gun metal grey
No omens in sight for all around
Just living alone with a hope that someday
I might see and angel arise to take me down

[Chorus]
Angel, I want to see you
Angel, Lord, I want to see you
Angel, I really want to see you
Angel, oh, I want to see you, right now
I got the blues I’ve got to pack my trunk and go
I got the blues I’ve got to pack my trunk and go
I've got a feeling you don't love me honey ain't that a crying shame?
Hey baby I want you to hold me tight you know

I can't even gun and butter but I feel myself sinking down
Honey what is wrong with you?
You know that I can't do nothing right
I just want you to act like I’ve got to go baby

What have you done to me?
Came talking your stuff
Want you to get a second time the rail's in the hole baby
Honey honey honey please come on home
I want to watch pretty baby till we are done
I'm a ramblin' pony
Rollin' from town to town

Rollin' from town to town
I'm a looking for a sweet woman - make my love come down

She's a married woman, yeah
Only nine years old

Crossing the countryside
I've got a lover now - she won't let old Greeny ride

Now, I'm leaving this morning won't be back no more
Now, I'm leaving this morning won't be back no more
There ain't a rider in the city - keep me inside the door
Oh well, the band is rockin', everybody's feelin' alright alright
It's a Wednesday night, there sure is gonna be a fight

Somebody's gonna get their head kicked in tonight
Well the joint is jumpin', everybody's shoutin' for more
Well there's gonna be a pool of blood on the dance hall floor
'Cause somebody's gonna get their head kicked in tonight
We're gonna rip up the chairs and tear down the walls
Smash up the band and really have a ball

Will be everybody in a physical rage
And the whole dance hall will be a doggone mess

Oh Well now the band is rockin' and everybody's feelin' alright
It's a Wednesday night, there sure is gonna be a fight
'Cause somebody's gonna get their head kicked in tonight

We're gonna rip up the chairs, tear down the walls
Smash up the band and really have a ball
Will be everybody in a physical rage
And the whole dance hall will be a doggone mess
Oh well now the band is rockin', everybody's shoutin' for more

I'm a man of action fire is my middle name
If you get burned little girl you are to blame
If you value your innocence stay out of my way
One touch of my power you'd be begging me to stay

'Cause I'm a man of action wild as the sea
Born for the blues born to be free
No, don't you get too close, so, don't you get too close
One touch of my power you could catch a dose

'Cause i'm a man of action no strings tie me down
No chick's attraction could make me stick around
So if you don't want to be burned don't give me no invitation
Until you have learned to live with desperation

Man of action, I'm a man of action
Man of action, man of action
Man of action, man of action
I'm a man of action
Well now look for me baby
'Cause you know I'm coming home
Well now look for me baby
'Cause you know I'm coming home
Well I really outn't love you darlin'
You know you done me wrong

Well I'm coming home to you baby
And I ain't gonna leave no more
Well I'm coming home to you baby and I ain't gonna leave no more
Well I know I done you wrong darlin'
Like I'm a knockin' at your door

I want to tell you baby
Just before I leave this town
I wanna tell you baby
Just before I leave this town
Well I'm coming home to you baby
And won't stand no pushin' around
In my life
There's been a few things worth singing
About you
Well, I never even dreamed
That I'd know you
Strange are the ways
Of a very complicated world
And there you are

Come to me now
And I'll never know another
You are a song for me, a melody
Ingrained in my soul
Sing, sing your song

For my ears, they only hear you
If I never knew the likes of you
Where would I be without you?
Without you
Without you
Without you, yeah
If I'd not heard your laughter
Maybe I wouldn't love you
If I'd not sung your music
I'd not come rolling after you
Oh, yeah

Crying out loud
The time had come and gone without you
Inside me
Love to be written about you
Strange are the ways
Of a very complicated world
And there you are

Come to me now
And I'll never know another
You are a song for me, a melody
Ingrained in my soul
Sing, sing your song

For my ears, they only hear you
If I never knew the likes of you
Where would I be without you?
Without you
Without you, yeah

Black dreads hangin' off my niggas, out the, no
Walk inside my crib, see dough so... can't even fold
Tell me why your bitch keep patrollin' like she 5-0
Say that she my bitch, but that bitch ain't even side ho
She gon' keep on workin' it for Fargo 'til her thighs broke

Money, that's that shit that I don't gotta
Would talk about your bitch, but tell the, man, I forgot her

And I don't say shut up no more, I... quiet
They know why, shit 'cause
I been with the killers talkin' dealers smoke
Niggas speakin' to you, but ain't really talkin'
Sittin' in the trap, eatin' cup of noodles
Higher than a nigga, Andy Milonakis
Niggas used to get it by the 8-ball
Now he tryna get it by the boat load
Condo sittin' out SoHo, hands up
Slow mo', nigga what's up?

[Chorus]

Shawty, I ain't seen you in a cold minute
That shit just made me wonder whose is it
That shit just made me wonder who's in it
Now you gotta tell me whose is it
Girl, I used to fuck you in Toronto
On the Lakeshore, by the condo
I would give it to you, never for sale
And she from the East, gotta meet at Yorkdale (Hands up, hands up)
Shawty, when we meet, gotta fuck for real
Took the TTC just to get to Old Mill
And we used to fuck, girl, I was so trill
You remind me of Monica, you was so real (Hands up, uh)

Sippin' on Patron (Hands, hands)
In LAC all night (Hands, hands)
But I ain't lackin' tonight

[Intro]
All I wanted was a new Mercedes
Bending off the corner whipping out the lot, I
Women love me but the niggas hate it
Hands the fuck up!

[Chorus]
All I wanted was a new Mercedes
Bending off the corner whipping out the lot, I got it

[Intro]
Yeah
I like this vibe
Smoking the good marijuana, man
Sipping the good codeine
What a time

[Verse 1]
Making money bags out of pillowcases
Making money bags on a daily basis
Tattoos on our baby faces, you can't faze to face us
We was raised by Jason, Norman Bates, and Satan, Hellraiser
Stunt like Jason Statham, the J's awaiting, that's my crazy patients
I got what they craving, they place the payment just to taste their favorite
Now I got 'em raving about my latest, you should check the ratings
Separate destinations for the extras making extra paper
Never giving statements to the agents during interrogation
Well aware with proper preparation skipping devastation
Devil never sleep, no sedation until heaven make us
Dreaming 'bout being in better places until hell awake us
We well aware of jealous haters with their allegations
Don't need them to validate us, need their gals to date us
Need their girls to serenade us with their salivators
But we lit like Talladega, Tunechi Schwarzenegger gone

[Chorus]
Hasta la vista, baby
Gone, hasta la vista baby
But I'll be back, baby
Yeah I'll be back, baby
Tunechi Schwarzenegger gone
Hasta la vista, baby
Hasta la vista, baby
Hasta la vista, baby
Hasta la vista, baby
But I'll be back, baby
Yeah I'll be back, baby
Gone, Tunechi Schwarzenegger

[Verse 2]
Oh look, my phone is blowing up
That's your bitch asking to come over, she shall overcome
Oh look my homies showing up, your homies know what's up
It's gon' take some cojones, hope and luck to cope with us, look
We hung right by that corner store with pumps, a lot of dope and bucks
And opened up that box Pandora shut like, keep it closed for what
We keep our noses up to smell the beef
Smell like a rose to us
And all roses must die slow as fuck, we speed it up
We slow it up because we pour it up, you know we pour it up
Trying to coexist with older thugs got us growing up
Knowing much but never know enough, now we loading up
Secret code of trust, keep us holding up and bold and tough
Chin high, eyes forward, shoulders up, protocol, overall
Fight like there’s no tomorrow, soldier (Soulja) boys, you!
Boy you just fuel to all of my fools
I give you little dudes the slaughterhouse rules
Pardon my drool but yall look like food
All that I do is charter my moves
Sparkle my jewels, harbor my goons
I'm hard on my boos cause all they wanna do is come to my room and walk on my moon
All these lil dudes wanna walk in my shoes
And argue about news that’s all about Tune
When all that I do is whatever I choose
And never let you alter my mood, gone

[Chorus]
Hasta la vista, baby
Gone, hasta la vista baby
But I'll be back, baby
Yeah I'll be back, baby
Tunechi Schwarzenegger (Gone)
Hasta la vista, baby (Gone)
Hasta la vista, baby (Gone)
Hasta la vista, baby (Gone)
Hasta la vista, baby (Gone)
I'll be back, baby (I'm gone)
I'll be back, baby (I'm gone)
Gone, Tunechi Schwarzenegger

[Bridge]
Hasta la vista, baby
Product of Cita, baby
High as Khalifa baby
I'm on the Keisha baby
Set it off like Latifa, baby
This lean is my anesthesia, baby
Tell the cops I got amnesia, baby

[Outro Chorus]
Hasta la vista, baby (Gone)
Hasta la vista, baby (Gone)
Hasta la vista, baby (Gone)

[Outro]

Come and fuck wit' a G, girl, you already know

Hustle with them dealers when it's time to get that bling for you
Knock it out the ring for you

I need to know, girl, I need to know somethin' (And I swear it, baby)

[Chorus]
'Cause you don't know my name
You don't know my name
'Cause you don't know my name, whoa

You don't know my name (You don't know my name)
'Cause you don't know my name
(And I swear it, baby)

[Outro]
Are we having fun today?
Some of y'all didn't know that song, okay

Because for those of y'all that didn't know that song
There's no possible way that you partyin' motherfuckers in Austin are gonna know this song right here
There's no way

I go by the name of Tory Lanez
Good motherfuckin' day
Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro]
No, no, no
No, no
Ah-yeah (Kid)

[Verse 1]
(Yeah, uh) Waking up, blurry vision
Cold sweats, overheat from overhearing
Yeah, conversations that you have with your friends
It's hard to forgive, but even harder to forget, ah-yeah
And everywhere I go you always seem to pop out
In my brain, where you lay, it's on lockdown
Yeah, conversations that I have in my head
It's hard to forgive, but even harder to forget, ah-yeah

[Chorus]
Everywhere I go, everything that I do
Reminds me of why I can't forget about you
From the pictures on my phone
To the songs I'm into
Yeah, everywhere I go I can't forget about you
Yeah, everywhere I go, everything that I do
Spent the evening looking the mirror and tucking my shirt back in
Play with my hair 'til I throw up both my hands, say, "Fuck it," and just give in

You're running again
I recognize it from the last time
Ooh, I think you're running again
Running again

Cast a spell, I'm talking to myself, but I'm not really listening
Open the door and stare into the face of a world that I can't resist

It's always the same
I recognize it from the last time
Ooh, you know it's always the same
Always the same

It's always the same
I recognize it from the last time
Ooh, you know it's always the same
Always the same
Slipping through my fingers
Take another picture
Guess at a new beginning
Guess that should be the best of me

Tell me 'bout your weekend
Climb into my clothing
Trees reaching through the distance
Throw it and see how far it lands

Where'd I leave my halo?
Where'd I hang my keys up?
Where does the time escape through?
Whose arms are there to run into?

Tired of every evening
Waiting for my moment
Time to reveal my full hand
Time to reveal my full hand
Time to reveal my full hand
It's time to reveal my full hand
Hang it on my neck like a medal to be won, yeah
Lift it on my back like I want it all
Have it out, have it out 'til I've had enough
Had enough, whatever it is

Hold it in my hands like a glass of champagne, yeah
Lift it up in a toast to myself
In the end, in the end, is it anything?
As I see it all spilling out

My treasure too far to find
I only want to listen
My melody in the air
I only want to listen

[Verse 1]
Why’d you have to set it off?
Trying to apologize, you should’ve kept it to yourself
You would’ve been better off
Keeping your disguise
Cause’ now your sleeping by yourself (huh)

[Pre-Chorus]
There’s nothing you can say to me
To make me feel the same
And you can do your best
But I refuse to play your game

[Chorus]
You should’ve just lied to me instead
Oh I can’t believe what you just said
There’s nothing you can to do make things right
Cause now that I know, hit the road
Lied to me instead
Oh I can’t believe what you just said
There’s nothing you can do to make things right
Cause’ now that I know, hit the road
You’re gone

[Verse 2]
You never gon’ get me back, no don’t even try
I’m going down another road
Honey get your bags packed
Cause’ you ain’t staying here tonight
I ain’t your baby anymore (fool)

[Pre-Chorus]
There’s nothing you can say to me
To make me feel the same
And you can do your best
But I refuse to play your game

[Chorus]
You should’ve just lied to me instead
Oh I can’t believe what you just said
There’s nothing you can to do make things right
Cause now that I know, hit the road
Lied to me instead
Oh I can’t believe what you just said
There’s nothing you can do to make things right
Cause’ now that I know, hit the road
You’re gone

[Chorus]
You should’ve just lied to me instead
Oh I can’t believe what you just said
There’s nothing you can to do make things right
Cause now that I know, hit the road
Lied to me instead
Oh I can’t believe what you just said
There’s nothing you can do to make things right
Cause’ now that I know, hit the road
You’re gone

[Intro]
Okay, I realize now, that everything that I did was wrong
Okay, I realize now, some things are better off said than done
Okay, I realize now, that maybe I'm not ready for love
Okay, I realize now, I finished us before we begun-un-un

[Chorus]
I'm done, so done, I'm done with all the games you play
I'm numb, so numb, I'm numb to all the pain you bring
I'm tryna figure this all out for myself
I don't need you or nobody else, I'm done, so done
So done, so done, so done, so done, I'm done
(Oh no, no-no-no, no-no-no)

[Verse]
I think that it's time for you to realize
That I'm not gon' be here forever but I
Wish that I was, but you were the cause
For every lil' feelin' I'm feeling inside
Sometimes I sit and I think about why
I even trusted you, shit, I'm surprised
I'm walkin' away from you, it's about time
Want you to walk out and walk out of my life
And you, yeah, you (Yeah, you)
You stay on my mind way more than I would like for you to
And you, yeah, you
The reason I can't find no love, don't wanna fight no more

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm done, so done, I'm done with all the games you play
I'm numb, so numb, I'm numb to all the pain you bring
I'm tryna figure this all out for myself
I don't need you or nobody else, I'm done, so done
So done, so done, so done, so done, I'm done

[Verse 1]
Paved paradise and put up a parking lot
With a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swingin' hot spot

[Chorus]
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
Paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Ooo-bop-bop-bop
Ooo-bop-bop-bop)

[Verse 2]
Took all the trees, put 'em in a tree museum
And they charged the people a dollar and a half just to see them

[Chorus]
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
They paved paradise, put up a parking lot
(Ooo-bop-bop-bop
Ooo-bop-bop-bop
Ooo-bop-bop-bop
Ooo-bop-bop-bop)

[Verse 3]
Hey farmer, farmer, put away the DDT now
Give me spots on my apples
But leave me the birds and the bees, please

[Chorus]
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
Paved paradise, put up a parking lot
Paved paradise, put up a parking lot

[Verse 4]
Late last night, I heard the screen door slam
And a big yellow taxi took away my old man

[Chorus]
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
Paved paradise, put up a parking lot
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?
2-3-4
Paved paradise, put up a parking lot
Paved paradise, put up a parking lot
Paved paradise, put up a parking lot ah-ah

[Verse 1: Harry Styles]
After the gold rush, there ain't no reason to stay
Shoulda learned from the movies that good guys don't run away
But roads weren't made to not go down
And there ain't room for both of us in this town

[Chorus: Harry Styles & Kacey Musgraves]
So you can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
I'll see you around again
'Cause I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does, too
We had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, ain't no sense in closing the gate
So you can have your space

[Chorus: Harry Styles & Kacey Musgraves]
You can have your space, cowboy
I ain't gonna fence you in
Go on, ride away in your Silverado
I'll see you around again
'Cause I know my place, and it ain't with you
Sunsets fade, and love does, too
Though we had our day in the sun
When a horse wants to run, ain't no sense in closing the gate
You can have your space
Yeah, you can have your space
You can have your space, cowboy

[Verse 1]
Mood is right
Spirits up
We're here tonight
And that's enough

[Chorus]
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time

[Verse 2]
Party's on
Feeling's here
That only comes
This time of year

[Chorus]
And we're simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time

[Verse 3]
The choir of children sing their song
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding
Oo-oo-oo
Oo-oo-oo
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-do, do

[Verse 4]
The word is out
About the town
To raise a glass
Oh, don't look down

[Chorus]
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time

[Verse 3]
The choir of children sing their song
They practiced all year long
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, ding dong
Ding dong, dong dong

[Verse 1]
Mood is right
Spirits up
We're here tonight
Oh, that's enough

[Chorus]
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Woah, a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time

[Verse 1: Stevie Nicks]
Baby, you'll come knocking on my front door
Same old line you used to use before
I said yeah, well what am supposed to do?
I didn't know what I was getting into

[Chorus 1: Stevie Nicks & Harry Styles]
So you've had a little trouble in town
So you're keeping some demons down
Stop draggin' my, stop draggin' my
Stop draggin' my heart around

[Verse 2: Stevie Nicks]
And jt's hard to think about what you've wanted
It's hard to think about what you've lost
Oo this doesn't have to be the big get even
This doesn't have to be anything at all

[Pre-Chorus: Harry Styles]
I know you really wanna tell me goodbye
I know you really wanna be your own girl

[Chorus 2: Stevie Nicks & Tom Petty]
Baby, you could never look me in the eye
Yeah, you buckle with the weight of the words
Stop draggin' my, stop draggin' my
Stop draggin' my heart around
Oh yeah yeah

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 3: Stevie Nicks]
Well there's people running 'round loose in the world
Ain't got nothing better to do
Oo they make a meal of some bright-eyed kid
Oo you need someone looking after you

[Pre-Chorus: Harry Styles]
I know you really wanna tell me goodbye
I know you really wanna be your own girl

[Chorus 2: Stevie Nicks & Tom Petty]
Baby, you could never look me in the eye
Yeah, you buckle with the weight of the words
Stop draggin' my, stop draggin' my
Stop draggin' my heart around
Oh yeah yeah

[Outro: Stevie Nicks]
Stop draggin' my heart around
Stop draggin' my heart around
Stop draggin' my heart around
Stop draggin' my heart around

[Verse 1: Stevie Nicks]
Is love so fragile and the heart so hollow
Shatter with words impossible to follow
You're saying I’m fragile, I try not to be
I search only for something I can't see
'Cause I have my own life
And I am stronger than you know

[Verse 2: Stevie Nicks]
But I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you won’t be walking out the door
Still I carry this feeling
When you walked into my house
That you won't be walking out the door

[Chorus: Stevie Nicks & Harry Styles]
Lovers forever, face to face
My city, your mountains
Stay with me, stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me my lace

[Verse 3: Harry Styles]
You in the moonlight
With your sleepy eyes
Could you ever love a man like me
And you were right
When I walked into your house
I knew I'd never want to leave

[Verse 4: Harry Styles]
Sometimes I'm a strong man
Sometimes cold and scared
Sometimes I cry
But that time I saw you
I knew with you to light my nights
Somehow I'd get by
First time I saw you
I knew with you to light my nights
Somehow I would get by

[Chorus: Stevie Nicks & Harry Styles]
Lovers forever, face to face
My city, your mountains
Stay with me, stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me my lace
Lovers forever, face to face
My city, your mountains
Stay with me, stay
I need you to love me
I need you today
Give to me your leather
Take from me my lace
Take from me my lace
Take from me my lace

Merky-ky-ky-ky-ky
London

[Chorus]
My bruddas don't dab, we just Vossi bop
I tell your girl to link me at the coffee shop
Getting freaky in the sheets, we're takin' body shots
Then I finish with a facial just to top it off, ayy
My bruddas don't dab, we just Vossi bop
I tell your girl to link me at the coffee shop
Getting freaky in the sheets, we're takin' body shots
Then I finish with a facial just to top it off, ayy

[Verse 1]
You ain't got a clue, let's be honest
I had a couple seeds and made a forest
I put in the work and take the profit
Lookin' at my girl like, "What a goddess" (Thank God)
Rule number two, don't make the promise
If you can't keep the deal then just be honest (Ayy)
I could never die, I'm Chuck Norris
Fuck the government and fuck Boris
I'm a villain, killin' when I'm barrin'
Brothers in the hood just like the movie that I star in
Servicin' my whip, I phoned the boss to bring my car in
I could probably take your chick, but I just wouldn't 'cause she's jarrin', oh
I got the sauce, don't know what you thought
Catch me up in snowin' in my sliders and my shorts
Chicks tryna get my brother Flipz to share his thoughts
I think he's tryna tell me I should tell her he don't talk
I don't fuck with her
Yeah, I used to hit it but you're stuck with her
Man, I wouldn't even try my luck with her
Gyal say I'm bougie, way too exclusive
Chillin' in Dubai, know I get it all inclusive
Now may I ask if you can find it in your spirit
To leave us all alone and go and mind your fuckin' business
Lookin' in the mirror sayin', "Mikey, you're the illest"
James Bond, tryna live my movie like I'm Idris
So we telling 'em look

[Chorus]
My bruddas don't dab, we just Vossi bop
I tell your girl to link me at the coffee shop
Getting freaky in the sheets, we're takin' body shots
Then I finish with a facial just to top it off, ayy
My bruddas don't dab, we just Vossi bop
I tell your girl to link me at the coffee shop
Getting freaky in the sheets, we're takin' body shots
Then I finish with a facial just to top it off, ayy

[Verse 2]
My bruddas don't dab, we just Vossi bop
So much Vossi I might open up a Vossi shop
Mummy sayin' that I need to get some sleep
All this flyin' overseas is always fuckin' up my body clock
And all this stress has got me wreckin' up my brain (Ayy, ayy)
So tell these likkle fishes back up off my name (Ayy, ayy)
I ain't gotta be a rapper with a chain
Cah the rules are kinda different when you're baddin' up the game, straight
Baddin' up the game, bad it up again
Had 'em up before, have 'em up again (Ayy)
Fake bruddas, man, your mandem all pretend
Pussy by himself, he's badder with his friends, aww
You man are so insecure, man, it's a joke (Man, it's a joke)
I need a Ballon d'Or, 'cause I'm the GOAT (Still the GOAT)
If you believe in your sauce then raise a toast (Raise a toast)
These are some genius thoughts so make the most
Told her "Save me some"
I need all the homage, could you pay me some?
Man a droppin' bangers on your baby mums
Gyal say I'm rude, they wanna see me nude
My name Stiff Chocolate, I got nothing left to prove
I got holes in my lapel, rubbin' shoulders with your girl
Which one of **** said that I would go to jail?
Well, I guess you have to hold a L
Tell 'em "This is London city, we the hottest in the world"
What we tellin' em? Look

[Chorus]
My bruddas don't dab, we just Vossi bop
I tell your girl to link me at the coffee shop
Getting freaky in the sheets, we're takin' body shots
Then I finish with a facial just to top it off, ayy
My bruddas don't dab, we just Vossi bop
I tell your girl to link me at the coffee shop
Getting freaky in the sheets, we're takin' body shots
Then I finish with a facial just to top it off, ayy
London

[Verse 1]
I see you dancing in the morning
I feel much better now that you are here
You are the wind that moves the ocean
The sand beneath my feet that keeps you near

[Chorus]
Bella, bella, bella
Bella, bella, bella

[Verse 2]
I see you smile at the horizon
I can guess only how good you feel
Now the sun is almost rising
You're the only one I know who's real

[Chorus]
Bella, bella, bella
Bella, bella, bella

[Verse 3]
Bella, you know I'll always love you
You mean the world to me
Bella, you keep the fire alive
You keep the fire alive in me

[Chorus]

Bella, bella, bella
Bella, bella, bella
Bella, bella, bella

But you, you didn’t like that, did you Murdoc?

FOGHORN

[Murdoc]
Who’s that laughing in the background?
Shut up, we’re talking

[Verse 1]
You say what if I hurt you, what if I leave you
What if I find somebody else and I don't need you?
What if this goes south, what if I mess you up?
You say what if I break your heart in two, then what?

[Pre-Chorus]
Well I hear you girl, I feel you girl, but not so fast
Before you make your mind up, I gotta ask

[Chorus: Kane Brown & Lauren Alaina]
What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?
And the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days, baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?

[Verse 2]
What if the sky falls (sky falls)
Or the sun stops burnin'?
We could worry about them what ifs 'til the world stops turnin'
Or I could kiss you (you should kiss me)
What if you liked it? (bet I'd like it)
Well we ain't never gonna know unless we try it

[Chorus]
What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?
And the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?
Awe yeah
C'mon

[Bridge]
You say what if I hurt you, what if I leave you?
What if I find somebody else and I don't need you?
Damn

[Chorus]
What if I was made for you and you were made for me?
What if this is it, what if it's meant to be?
What if I ain't one of them fools just playin' some game?
What if I just pull you close, what if I lean in?
And the stars line up, and it's our last first kiss
What if one of these days baby, I go and change your name?
What if I loved all these what ifs away?

[Outro]
Away (away)
What if?

[Chorus]
Everything is fading fast like a polymetronomic harmony
I hope this pain doesn't last like a polymetronomic harmony
Everything's so beautiful like a polymetronomic harmony
I hope one day my stomach's full with a polymetronomic harmony

[Bridge]
The sky is so blue
And I'm stuck in this cave
I need to get away
I can no longer be your slave

[Chorus]
Everything is fading fast like a polymetronomic harmony
I hope this pain doesn't last like a polymetronomic harmony
Everything's so beautiful like a polymetronomic harmony
I hope one day my stomach's full with a polymetronomic harmony

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Everything is fading fast like a polymetronomic harmony
I hope this pain doesn't last like a polymetronomic harmony
Everything's so beautiful like a polymetronomic harmony
I hope one day my stomach's full with a polymetronomic harmony

[Verse]
It doesn't bother me
Just leave it on the table
Now, do you need a glass?
It all seems like a fable, yeah
Whatever you feel, I feel just the same
How about we just stop playing this game? Oh lord

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm surrounded by hustlers
Everything is just moving too fast
The city's absorbing me
I sold my soul

[Chorus]
I'm a prophet for profit
And I will always be that way
I'm a prophet for profit
I know you got nothing to say
I'm a prophet for profit
I can be your hero, save the day
I'm a prophet for profit
So baby, why don't you come out and play?

[Bridge]
Whatever you feel, I feel just the same
What shall we do as they kill and maim? Oh lord

[Chorus]
I'm a prophet for profit
And I will always be that way
I'm a prophet for profit
I know you got nothing to say
I'm a prophet for profit
I can be your hero, save the day
I'm a prophet for profit
So baby, why don't you come out to play?

[Verse 1]
Are you a lucid dream? That's what it seems
I'm not really sure if it's real
But I just got to say, I found my way
The forest got some magical feel, yeah

[Chorus]
You've got to color my life
You've got to fill in my thoughts
You've got to color my life (When the city is gone)
You've got to fill in my thoughts (With the feels I'm on)

[Break]

[Verse 2]
Are you a lucid dream or just a beam of light
Shining on me?
Or better yet the camera, you press record
Living in the playback we see

[Chorus]
You've got to color my life
You've got to fill in my thoughts
You've got to color my life (When the city is gone)
You've got to fill in my thoughts (With the feels I'm on)

[Bridge]
With the feels I'm on
With the feels I'm on
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
You've got to color my life
You've got to fill in my thoughts
You've got to color my life (Color my life)
You've got to fill in my thoughts (Fill in my thoughts)
You've got to color my life (My life)
You've got to fill in my thoughts (Fill in my thoughts)
You've got to color my life
You've got to fill in my thoughts

[Outro]
You've got to color my life
You've got to fill in my thoughts
You've got to color my life
You've got to fill in my thoughts
You've got to color my life

[Verse 1]
I can't stop reflecting upon the reflection of my own reflection
It's like a mind game that I can't tame
Like an empty shell that feels no pain
Just like the bodies twitching, convulsing in every direction
We are a fragmented shard of glass
With minds fixated on the past

[Pre-Chorus]
How do we heal, mama?
Show us the way
How do we heal, mama?
Show us the way

[Chorus]
Live and love
Rise above
Laugh and play
Smile all day
Swim in the sea
Learn to be me
Walk on the earth within time

[Post-Chorus]
Show us the way
Show us the way to live

[Verse 2]
Now I feel eternal bliss
The shattered glass is gone
Now I know what Siddhartha knows
The way it ebbs and flows
Every emotion is a river in motion
Because the river flows within
The river flows within

[Pre-Chorus]
How do we heal, mama?
Show us the way
How do we heal, mama?
Show us the way

[Chorus]
Live and love
Rise above
Laugh and play
Smile all day
Swim in the sea
Learn to be me
Walk on the earth within time

[Post-Chorus]
Show us the way
Show us the way to live
Show us the way to live
Show us the way to live
Show us the way to live

[Verse 1]
Hello, I just want you in my life
And now I’m so excited to feel
Everything you got inside of your soul now
Everything you got inside of your soul now

[Chorus]
I just want to love you
I need you to love me
I just want to love you
We can fall in love now

[Verse 2]
The past is done with
The present is now
What will we do with the time that we have?
How will we bring back the love that we had?

[Pre-Chorus]
All I really wanna do is love you today now
All I really wanna do is love you today now

[Chorus]
I just want to love you
I need you to love me
I just want to love you
We can fall in love now

I just want to love you
I need you to love me
I just want to love you
We can fall in love now

[Outro]
I, I need you to love me

[Verse 1]
Should I call her now?
It's been so long I don't know how
It was six months ago
I told her we were through
Right out of the blue
What was wrong with me?

[Chorus]
I know it
I feel it is true
I don't know why
My heart beats for you
I show it
I feel it inside
It's so right
My heart beats for you

[Verse 2]
I missed you all this time
I was so busy rewinding you into my mind
Now I find myself on the road
We used to drive before
Now I need you more
Man, I start to feel
That there is some hope
It will help me cope
Fate will prevail
And we will be together

[Chorus]
I know it
I feel it is true
I don't know why
My heart beats for you
I show it
I feel it inside
It's so right
My heart beats for you

[Outro]
I know it
I feel it is true
I don't know why
My heart beats for you
I show it
I feel it inside
It's so right
My heart beats for you

[Verse 1]
Invisible people, we're tired of living in the dark
Everyone is trying to tear us apart
All we wanna do is heal now
Smoke a spliff so I can feel now, yeah

[Verse 2]
Invisible people, the truth is we're all the same
The concept of race was implanted inside your brain
It's time to start all over
You best believe we're taking over

[Chorus]
Spinnin' the world around you
Spinnin' the world around you
Spinnin' the world around you
Spinnin' the world around you

[Verse 3]
Invisible people, the truth is we take the blame
Fuck the system, it created so much pain
It's time to start all over (Yeah)
You best believe we're taking over

[Chorus]
Spinnin' the world around you
Spinnin' the world around you
Spinnin' the world around you
Spinnin' the world around you
Spinnin' the world around you
Spinnin' the world around you
Spinnin' the world around you
Spinnin' the world around you

[Verse 1]
The other day my uncle told me a story
He said, "Son, it gets a bit gory
One night I had to flee and leave my land
My older brother stole some heavy contraband
They came for him, he wasn't there, they came for me
The drug cartel made me a refugee"

[Verse 2]
"Two motorcyclists came towards me
Right away I knew they were the enemy
I saw the malice in their eyes
But I held a twenty-two, to their surprise"

[Verse 3]
"The gunman jumped off the back of the bike
Cold-blooded terror is nothing I like
Adrenaline rippin' apart my brain
Couldn't let these killers erase my name"

[Verse 4]
"I let a bunch of bullets fly
Then I took off running towards the sky
I'll never know if they got hit
But there was nobody behind me when I split"

[Verse 5]
"I ran back home as fast as I could
No choice now, I had to leave for good
I packed a bag, the few things I own
Deal gone bad will never leave me alone"

[Verse 6]
"I heard a dozen cars creep by
Mercenary always sly
They were ready to take my life that day
That's why I live right here, five hundred miles away"

[Verse 1]
I'm like a cloud shape-shifting everywhere
Above the ground, I'm flying through the air
Right past the crowd
My heart is screaming loud

[Chorus]
This moment of joy is thrilling me
This moment of joy is keeping me high
This moment of joy is the light that shines every day

[Verse 2]
Me and you, here to catch a view
Rolling hills, the dawn of something new
In the groove
Wind is in my sails
Like an eagle moving in a flash
Her light that shines is infinitely precious

[Chorus]
This moment of joy is thrilling me
This moment of joy is keeping me high
This moment of joy is the light that shines every day

[Bridge]
I know that I'm happy
I know that I'm happiest
When I feel the sunshine
Seeping into my heart, yeah

[Chorus]
This moment of joy is thrilling me
This moment of joy is keeping me high, oh yeah
This moment of joy
This moment of joy

[Verse 1]
She's the pink elephant in the room
She's a mercenary with perfume
Just like in the movies, she kills for fun
Decapitating heads like the shogun, yeah

[Chorus]
The skyscrapers are tall
What you gonna do when they fall?
Now I'm heading for the hills
All this trouble ain't worth a thrill
All this trouble ain't worth a thrill, yeah

[Verse 2]
She's the pink elephant in the room
She's got an eagle's eye worth of zoom
She's quite incomparable in terms of style
Extremely fucking dangerous and hostile

[Bridge]
Everyone is nervous, no one says a thing
While the film is rolling, what can you bring
That will make the vibe right
The way it should be?
I don't really give a fuck no more
I'm out the door

[Chorus]
The skyscrapers are tall
What you gonna do when they fall?
Now I'm heading for the hills
All this trouble ain't worth a thrill
All this trouble ain't worth a thrill

[Outro]
She's the pink elephant in the room
Pink elephant in the room
Pink elephant in the room
Pink elephant in the room, yeah

[Verse 1]
I woke up from a beautiful dream
It felt so good to see
You smiling merrily
But now you're just a memory
Reality's so cruel
Leaving me
Wounds that never heal

[Chorus]
Since you've been gone
Wounds that never heal
It pains me so much that I can never see you again
Wounds that never heal
Nothing will ever be the same
Wounds that never heal
You're no longer alive, you live forever

[Verse 2]
There's not a day that goes by that i don't think of you
You're the center of the firmament
The essence of all permanence
You make me shake in my sleep
I wish I could always keep you
So I would never feel
Wounds that never heal

[Chorus]
Since you've been gone
Wounds that never heal
It pains me so much that I can never see you again
Wounds that never heal
Nothing will ever be the same
'Cause you're gone
Wounds that never heal
You're no longer alive, you live forever

[Outro]
Forever
Forever
Forever
Forever

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
We took it from a Lamborghini to a dressing room
We took it from the dressing room to her mama room
I get deep in the box, I didn't even set the moods
Call it California cuddling, California cuddling
I told the baby not to worry, I’ma cop her some new boobs
Stay in your jurisdiction, I bring everything to you
I told her not to worry, I'm no nigga without a clue
Pay her little sister tuition, she don't need no night school

[Chorus: Young Thug]
She don’t need no night school
Mmmm, hey, hey, hey
She hotter than soup
Hotter than Loubs, higher than Coogi suits

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, wheeze
They ain't even my speed
Flexin' on these niggas got me throwin' on my tee
Got me jumpin' in my crowd
Got me throwin' up money
Got me goin' in my golds
Got me showin' off my teeth, like
Black privilege gotta mean somethin’, uh
Dark liquor for the weak stomach, uh
White styrofoam cup with lean on it
Pull up microphone out, let her sing on it
Aggressions, comparisons
To fake means is embarrassing
Give ’em classic, if it matters, I'm embarrassed
I think about a state of mind and how my state is more passive
Few milli’ spend on bad habits
Other half on taxes

[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
Yeah
Yeah-yeah
I don't chat
Uh

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
My bitch ass so fat, it be hittin' me back
My bitch thighs so fat, I could sit on her lap
My garage so packed, Benz on Benz back to back (Benz)
I'm bringing back that Crunchy Black, Project Pat and La Chat

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky, A$AP Rocky & Juicy J]
Crunchy black nigga, we don't chat, nigga we don't rap nigga, Fendi facts, that's a fact, nigga
That's some facts and some rap, come in action-packed
Black on black, Fendi black, uh what I say?

Off the matte, uh, but now I'm back, uh
It's all that chat, fuck you say? Where they at? (Shut the fuck up)
My bitch stack so thick, half of that, give me back
My bitch calves so rich, fuck a rat, piggyback
To my sections so lit, twenty chicks, fifty rack
She blow the bag so quick, like gimme this, gimme that, bitch
Keep the backpack raps, I'm like Kendrick and Cole
Ain't you niggas is different? Y'all like bitches and hoes
Put them work in the corner just to fit in them clothes
Never fit and never since I used to sit in the cold
Had the vision before, yeah, the vision was gold
I'ma pimp and a stroll, fuck your bitch in my row
I ain't no Afrojack, I'm more like Aloe Blacc
Bitch, I need dollars

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & Juicy J]
My bitch ass so fat, it be hittin' me back (Go Flacko, go Flacko)

(Shut the fuck up)

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, yeah
In the gym like I'm Hercules
Keep the circle strong like im circulis
No squares with us, that's isosceles
That's the old money, like it's obsolete
More money than Monopoly
Get awarded money the new nominee
On the honor roll no cap and gown
Slow your roll, keep the cappin' down
Play your holy down, now they claiming that they know you now
All the naysayers that ain't see it in you wanna show you how they believed it and support you now and shit, shit
It's unfortunate and shit, shit
Read 'em like a fortune, want a piece of the fortune
All the fast money, it will slow you down
Need a bad bunny just to hold me down
And a babes bunny just to walk around with
Walk around the whole town for me
No cab money, no backlit
Won't act funny, just cheese cake
And bag money on the bag end and it's back money
I'm into her so there so such thing as bad press or bad money
On that note, I'm good money
My hood bitch do my plaits for me
Bad bitch got a tat' on me
Told her next time better tat' money
No funny money, no Al Bundy
I ain't no Afrojack, I'm more like Aloe Blacc
Bitch, I need dollars

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & Juicy J]
My bitch ass so fat, it be hittin' me back (Go Flacko, go Flacko)
My bitch thighs so fat, I could sit on her lap (Go Flacko, go Flacko)
My garage so packed, Benz on Benz back to back (Go Flacko, go Flacko)
I'm bringing back that crunchy black, Project Pat and La Chat (Go Flacko, go Flacko, bitch)

What's so serious that you can't just pick up the phone
Let him know you love him
And that he's been on your mind
Tell him that you need your brother
Ask him how he's doing
And say you been doing fine
If it comes a point where you just don't know what to say
While you still have him on the line
Just say

[Intro]
This rap game crazy, man
It's just like, knamsayin'?
Once I got rich and famous and got in this shit, I ain't know the media was just takin' in your name and just go ham wit' it
Like, I don't know what the fuck this 'lluminati shit is

[Verse]
I never told the people about how the media portray my name
Tryna scrape my name, tryna make it look-a like a nigga is fuckin' lame
Like I'm insane, like I'm goin' crazy, actin' lazy and then persuade me
I'm like, "What the fuck? I'm just tryna be me", everytime I wake up, face on TV
They talk about me in the news, tryna give a nigga the blues
Can they give a nigga a clue? Tell me what the fuck to do
I'm reachin' out to all my fans, grab my hand, let's pray together
Every day I wake up, and I make it rain, and I change the weather
They hate on me, but they hated Jesus, this shit ain't easy, this shit hard
I promise to God I love my fam, I do this shit here for my fans
Every day I wake up and I thank God for wakin' me up
And blessin' me wit' all of this and my family, I love this shit
I reminiscence, back in the days, when I was broke, just like a slave
Ain't have a dollar in my fuckin' pocket, I ain't had shit to fuckin' eat
I ain't had nowhere to fuckin' sleep, I ain't had no CD on repeat
So why these niggas fuckin' wit' me? Man, why the media hatin' on me?
Every day I fuckin' wake up, they lyin' on my name
I'm lookin' in the news, man, this shit a fuckin' shame
Do they got anythang better to do? But they fuckin' lie then jeopardize and burn bridges
I'm fuckin' gone, I'm fuckin' in it, I'm in it to win it
I don't give a fuck, they can't say that I can't rap
But when the day I die, my whole family will be sad
And I put that shit on God, and I put that on my heart
And I will never sell my soul, I said that shit there from the start
So fuck everybody hatin', every day I'm gon' get paper
Yeah, I'ma wake up, I'ma go to chase it, gon' give a fuck, first place, I'ma race it
Look, niggas be talkin' 'bout me, but really, they don't shit know 'bout Soulja
I'm gon' post up like I 'posed to, graduated from south Panola
Got a chip up on my shoulder, I don't give a fuck, I'm livin', what it is?
Man, these niggas disrespectin' me, I put money on they head
Man, these niggas, they really not loyal
They really don't care about the shit you do for 'em
I put this nigga on, now he actin' like a bitch
I made this nigga rich, now this nigga wanna snitch
But I'ma keep it cool, ain't gon' even say no names
'Cause I swear I won't play no game, and I don't like to fuck around wit' no lames
They say, "Soulja Boy, did you sign him? Who signed who? Go find him so I can blind dude"
I don't give a fuck, nigga, I'll remind you: I'm Simpson Road, I'm Chi-Town
I was born in Chicago, raised in Atlanta
I went to Mississippi and I swagged like goddamn it
Now every time I wake up, all I see is Soulja Boy Tell' Em
All up in the news and media, what the fuck you gonna tell him?
I'ma tell him this: "Bitch, suck my dick", I'm filthy rich 'til I fuckin' die
And I ain't never goin' broke, bitch nigga, you gon' write my name up in the sky
Why would I lie? One concert, that's fifty racks in my fuckin' pockets
So you hatin' on me and the media and them stupid blogs? Bitch nigga, stop it, I don't give a fuck
Shouts out to Rap Radar, shouts out to RealTalkNY.net
Media take out all that fuckin' shit, I ain't never give a fuck, I ain't never been a bitch
Shouts out to my nigga 50 Cent
He gave me some good game, I'ma keep that shit in my heart, mane
Ain't gon' never forget who put me on that made me rich, that's me
I don't owe nobody shit, I don't owe nobody shit, bitch

[Verse]
Remember that time I was sitting up sick, couldn't sleep in the middle of the night?
You said, "Bae, let me take you to the ER"
I said, "Nah, I'ma be alright"
Well, the next day I found out from fucking around that the sickness I had was life
And I was fixed to keeping the decision to keep it
Knowing I had to get rid of it, rid of it
Live with it, he don't know, you don't know I had to deal with it
You thought what you put me on from Part II was the realest shit
It ain't right, I ain't proud, I won't cry, I can't hide
But when it was you, I was strong
Now it's you, what you gon' do?

[Chorus]
I would do anything, to get your trust back
I hid and I know what you mean, and you can trust that
I realize that we're both wrong
And no more lies, we could move on
If you lose that trust you built for so long
Now that's the test to see if you're strong, to see if you're strong
Yeah, that's the test to see if you're strong

[Outro]
You realize what I just told you?
You don't realize it, huh?
Well you can play it back
Yeah, these are my confessions, 'fessions, 'fessions, 'fessions

[Intro]
Cherry, you've been lookin' at my man
And you're makin' me feel real bad
Real, real sad
Real, real sad
Che-che-che-che-cherry

[Verse 1]
Can you tell me how this happen?
'Cause I'm goin' insane
I thought we were everlastin', how did it get this way?
You knew that this shit would hurt me
You cause my heart to break
You pulled this stunt a million times, but never quite this way

[Pre-Chorus]
How can you look at my face, if you got nothin' to say?
Through all the ups and the downs
How could you do me this way?
You know I trusted you
You know I trusted you
Do you feel any shame?
Thought we were one and the same
Gave you the shirt off my back, gave you the key to my place
You know I trusted you
But now I'm done with you

[Verse 2]
I am not the one to tell you, how to live your life
But you can have my sloppy seconds, keepin' mine alright

[Pre-Chorus]
How can you look at my face, if you got nothin' to say?
Through all the ups and the downs
How could you do me this way?
You know I trusted you

Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse: Roddy Ricch]
...wake up and get off a lick, oh, yeah

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch]
How I feel today? I wanna ride the Wraith
Bitch, your Rollie fake, it's cloudy in the face
All I worry 'bout is money and the drip all day
Roddy Ricch, all a nigga do is Crip all day
R.I.P....
Is that me at the wheel on a highway on the earth?
Tryna speed, but the traffic's getting heavier
Take it slow, take it easy, take it to the edge
Not a joke, not a joke, I just find it funny, yeah

Some voice from the upstairs calling down
"Hey, boys, what do you hope for?"
Ooh, someday, when the grass gets greener
Look way up high then look way down, way down, ah-ah, ah-ah

What a trip to confront the truth inside your heart
Spilling out in the sunset, glowing in the dark
Fully honest, fully honest, fully honest with myself
As I dive sideways and into the deep end 'til I drown, oh-ooh-oh

Some voice from the dry land calling down
"Hey, boys, what do you hope for?"
Ooh, someday, when the sky gets bluer
I'll lift my hands and shout so loud, so loud, ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Alright
Let's get started
Woo, yeah
You can feel it, yeah
Can you feel it?
Vibrations, yeah

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Okay, I went to sleep faded then I woke up invisible (Wow)
Keep the ingredients, but I got the kitchen full (Woah)
Thoughts are cynical, actions unpredictable
Super models bitches hold auditions in my swimmin' pool
And this feelin' is feelin' pretty invincible (I know)
Pray this life reciprocal and I'ma come back an eagle
Thirsty for evil, the wine chilled in Hell (Right here)
I gave my life to this shit, already killed myself
No-no-no-no-no
We ain't the same homie (No)
The world afraid to change but it changed on me (Woah)
Always been the realest keep the same homies (Uh-uh)
So that bullshit fades slowly

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
It's goin'
Goin', goin, goin', goin', goin', goin, goin', goin'
Will you follow? (Gone)
Where are you goin'?
Watch it go, go, go, where are you goin' for real? Go, go, go
Where are you goin'? Go, go, go, go, go, go
Okay
Gone-gone, gone-gone

[Verse 2: Mac Miller & Delusional Thomas]
Yeah
Okay, I went to sleep famous and I woke up invisible (Okay)
Rich as fuck and miserable
At least I did Kimmel and Arsenio, my mom got it on video
That's the shit I live for, all this other shit is trivial (One, two, go)
Wi-wi-wi-will you bear witness to a miracle?
I don't know, I'm not a kid no more, comin' for those residuals
(That money) Be asleep in a couple minutes
My bitch have a nightmare, wake up, made me some cereal
She knows I love my cereal (She knows)
The sun come up, I gotta face that
Oh my God, here we go
I'ma blow it, yeah
Am I okay? Fuck no
Just so nuts so
Need to let the drugs go
Tryna find Heaven, I get high but never come close
We still, wonder why we'll never learn to love
It's because, all the air is filled with gun smoke
A middle finger to the cyber Gods
Fall back or I'ma fuck around and let this virus off (Get it)
In the mud, fuck your brainwash, I'm signin' off (Dead)
Pain killer God with an upload

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Yeah
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
Where are you goin'? Gone
Do you have a destination?
Watch it go
Do you have a destination?
Do you have a destination?
Do you have a destination?
Do you have a destination?
Do you have a destination?
Do you have a destination?
Do you have a destination?
Wow

[Outro: Mac Miller]
Do you have a destination?

[Verse 1]
I listen for your footsteps coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps, but they don't arrive
Waiting for your knock, dear, on my old front door
I don't hear it--does it mean you don't love me any more?

[Verse 2]
I hear the clock a'ticking on the mantel shelf
See the hands a'moving, but I'm by myself
I wonder where you are tonight, and why I'm by myself
I don't see you, does it mean you don't love me any more?

[Chorus]
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so, how I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

[Verse 3]
I'm sorry that I doubted you, I was so unfair
You were in a car crash, and you lost your hair
You said that you would be late, about an hour or two
I said that's alright, I'm waiting here, just waiting to hear from you

[Chorus]
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so, I'll hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

I'm waiting for you honey
Hurry up to me
I don't want you to pass me by, don't need to make me cry
I want you to make me
(Yes sir! Take one of the mighty jumbo band!)

Desmond has a barrow in the marketplace
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Molly, girl, I like your face
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand

Ob la di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on
Ob-la di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on

Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweler's store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing

Ob la di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on
Ob-la di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on
In a couple of years they have built
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones

Happy ever after in the market place
Desmond lets the children lend a hand
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
And in the evening she still sings it with the band

Ob la di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on
Ob-la di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on

In a couple of years they have built
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones

Happy ever after in the market place
Molly lets the children lend a hand
Desmond stays at home and does his pretty face
And in the evening she still sings it with the band

Ob la di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on
Ob-la di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on
And if you want some fun, sing ob-la-di, bla-da

(Ob-la-di, ob-la-da brother!)

[Chorus]
Used to have friends, now I got enemy
Hundred bands on forty, that don't matter to me
Used to have friends, now I got enemy
Enemy, I got so many

[Verse 1]
I don't know what to do about, 'bout, 'bout
I guess that I am talking too much, bla-bla-bla (Ooh)
I don't know what to do about, 'bout, 'bout
I guess that I am talking too much, bla-bla-bla
Fuck, where did it go?
Where did that go, and a hundred let it go (Ayy)
Turn it up, got forty enemies, uh-oh
Four hundred on my wrist, oh I think that this
I know, it's hard
Two door Nisa
Ride, you know they me (Me)
Ride, you know they me (Me)

[Chorus]
Used to have friends, now I got enemy
Hundred bands on forty, that don't matter to me
You know on a forty, all the matter free
This some on a forty, it don't matter to me

[Post Chorus]
Would I, would I? Let me know, ha
Would I, would I? Let me know, ha
Used to have friends, now I got enemy
Enemy, I got so many

[Verse 2]
I know, wanted on the ball
I'm the one that matter (Ooh), throw all on the ball
And we know that I don't (I don't), crashed the Wraith
Then I went and gone and copped a Phantom, Phantom
Ooh, ooh
That's a spooky goddamn ghost, ooh, ooh
Sign 'em up, sign 'em up, for, for it
And I won't, let me wrong, oh, oh
Sign 'em up, then I roll, oh, oh
Said in the morning that I'm gonna, gonna get back
It's a morning on a hundred, wanna get back
I'm like, "bitch, give me a break", like a Kitkat
I got a hundred on these bitches inside my big bag
On and on

[Chorus]
Used to have friends, now I got enemy
Hundred bands on forty, that don't matter to me
You know on a forty, all the matter free
This some on a forty, it don't matter to me

[Post Chorus]
Would I, would I? Let me know, ha
Would I, would I? Let me know, ha
Used to have friends, now I got enemy

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, don't let me go
Oh-oh-oh-oh, never let me go
Oh-oh-oh-oh, let me, let me go

[Chorus]
Used to have friends, now I got enemy
Hundred bands on forty, that don't matter to me
You know on a forty, all the matter free

[Post Chorus]
Would I, would I? Let me know, ha
Would I, would I? Let me know, ha
Used to have friends, now I got enemy
Enemy, I got so many
Friends and where they live
Something I could never give up
Never skipping town, never growing up

It's embedded in my brain
That things will never change
The way it is is the way things are, so deal with it

Like I'm dealing it to me
The front seat of my helicopter's free
We could get so high we forget everything

They forgot about us any way you wanna shake it
That's the plot, and you'll never believe this
But that's all we've got in the end

Can't tell you I'm growing impatient
I'm just having a little fun with it
I'm just having a little fun now

That's my spotlight
That's my cool life
That's my baby
Don't it look nice?
Can't tell you I'm growing impatient
I'm just having a little fun with it
I'm just having a little fun now

That's my spotlight
That's my cool life
That's my baby
Don't it look nice?
That's my spotlight
That's my cool, cool life
That's my baby
Don't it look nice?
I am giving you this
I am giving you this, what I'm holding in my pocket
Hold it like my weakened hands could keep it, really keep it
I am giving you this

Don't you lose it
Don't you lose it now
Even if I try sometimes to lose myself somehow

I am telling you this
I am telling you this like a juvenile in secret
Confident and trusting you to keep it, really keep it
I am telling you this

Don't you lose it
Don't you lose it now
Even if I try sometimes to lose myself somehow

Hello, Fatou
How are you?
I apologize, uh, I-I don't speak too much French
And I gotta say this song we made, "Désolé" (Mhm)
It's a really good tune
Did you enjoy making the song?
Yes, I loved
When we're working, it's not working
It's just like, friends (Yeah), and having fun together
And this is very important, you know
Well, that's what it's all about
Yeah, it was amazing
Well, I really look forward to seeing you again because I think you are the most fun person I've met this year
Oh, thank you, au revoir

Yeah, yeah
Please acknowledge me, fuck the dreams of equality
I oughta be a leader but ain’t nobody follow me
World wants to swallow me right into the dirt
But fuck that, I’d rather a clique put three in my shirt
I’m headed to heaven, crash landed in hell
My moms ain’t understand that she’s the 

[?]
She got me trapped like a cell so I put on some L
And lay back ASAP, I’ma yell my farewells
I excel from the other side of the world
Where the grass is greener and the shells carry pearls
And I’m here now, but one day I’ll be gone
Until then I smoke a big L and put it on
'Cause I just live my life like that
Instead of fightin' back I chill and write rap
'Cause I dream of the day where people pay to have my songs
You hate my style 'cause it’s ancient like Babylon
And when rap is gone, I’ll be too
You won’t see me anymore, but I’ll see you
And free you? Nah, I’ll think I’ll keep you a slave
'Cause your mind is in the dark like the back of the cave
And back in the day... well, I wasn’t here
Visine in my eyes, still nothing is clear
If hip-hop is dead, then I’m the resurrection
Represented by presidents, all same complexions

[Chorus: Nas]
Presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money!)
I'm out for dead ******* presidents to represent me (Whose...)

I’m the king of the land, the air and the seas
Please, who you know that does it like me?
Yeah, now my mind's fucked up, like I just took a Valium
I’m sorry daddy that I didn’t bring back medallions
No grades to put up on the fridge
And I’m sorry that I didn’t grow up as a kid
'Cause I grew up like a man, you need to understand
That I know that everything I got was put up in my hand
Yeah, it’s my life, so you need to let me live it
"Kid's so privileged," "kid is so gifted"
You never liked my fitteds, call me The Mad Hatter
But I’m killing wack rappers, cats that rap 

[?]
Thought I act black 'cause I’m sagging jeans
And I’m just doing my work while I’m bagging up weed
Yeah, the haters, man, they nothin' to me
He told me that I gotta work hard, nothin' is free
Yeah, it’s all in my mind for the paper
Mother Earth is mine, I'ma take her

You think, you talk but don't do
You stress, you stop, don't move
(M-M-Man, cut this shit off)
I just want to get close
I just want to get close
I just want to get close
I just want to get close

I just want to get close
I just want to get close
I just want to get close
I just want to get close

(M-M-Man, cut this shit off)
(You don't rap like that)

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
She breaks down the pain
Yeah

[Verse 1]
She breaks down the pain, she rolls up the weed
She far from a saint, she's all that I need
She lost in her thoughts, so hardly she speaks
Her mind's always dirty and her soul's never free (Whoa-whoa)
She never been a groupie (No way)
She just in love with the music
She watch depressin' movies (Always)
Somethin' from the '30s or the '40s about a dependent house wife (Whoa-whoa)
She makes up her bed like she makes up her stories
Awake through the night, then she high from the morning
I wish she could feel me, she never felt nothin'
Knock on her door, she let me come in (Whoa)

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish she would learn to live
Isolation, she lockin' the bathroom door

[Chorus]
Baby, let's get stoned
Put on a record, can I play you one more song?
We can get stoned
I swear to God, heaven feels just like home
Let's go home

[Verse 2]
Yeah
And the water, it's shallow like the lies that she tells
Can't run from your shadow, can't hide from yourself
She hates that she cries when she's all by herself
And she's always all by herself (Whoa-whoa)
She hardly talks in conversation (No way)
But, but when she do, all the words get lost in translation (Always)
No, she can't move (Whoa-whoa-whoa)
'Cause she paralyzed from the fear that she fantasized
The doctor tried to analyze
They can not find anything that's wrong with her
Her parents never got along with her
I had to make this song for her (Whoa-whoa-whoa)

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish she would learn to live
Isolation, she lockin' the bathroom door

[Chorus]
Baby, let's get stoned
Put on a record, can I play you one more song?
We can get stoned
I swear to God, heaven feels just like home
Let's go home
Baby, let's get stoned
Put on a record, can I play you one more song?
We can get stoned
I swear to God, heaven feels just like home
Let's go home

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish she would learn to live
Isolation, she lockin' the bathroom door

[Chorus]
Baby, let's get stoned
Put on a record, can I play you one more song?
We can get stoned
I swear to God, heaven feels just like home
Let's go home

[Intro]
Yeah

[Chorus]
There is nothin' (Yeah,) to fear (Yeah, whoa-whoa-whoa)
Unless nobody is here (Whoa-whoa-whoa)
And as my head kisses my bed, it'll be a while 'til I see you again
Girl, you're just like (Just like,) my pillow (My pillow, whoa)
Girl, you're just like (Just like,) my pillow (My pillow, whoa)
Girl, you're just like (Just like,) my pillow (My pillow, whoa)
And as my head kisses my bed, it'll be a while 'til I see her again (Don't wanna leave, whoa) (Whoa-whoa-whoa)
Girl, you're just like my pillow (Whoa)

[Refrain]
Ayy (Ayy, ayy), slow down, baby (Won't ya? Won't ya?)
Why don't you slow down, baby? (Won't ya? Won't ya?)

[Verse]
Yeah, yeah
I'm havin' cold sweats, guess I'll sweat out this alcohol
Don't know which one gonna kill me, is it cocaine or adderall?
Refuse a kind gesture of sleep, pop me a Tylenol
PM, okay, I'll see you when I see you then
Stay up, late night, work late, no date nights
You give 'em hell, girl, you just like a cage fight
Always watched my health, you, cooked me them egg-whites
You can take my breath away like, just like death
You just like death, 'cause, baby, after you there really ain't shit left
I don't know what to do except try my best
I bet that I'ma hurt you just as much as the next
Man, you took a plane out to Cali' to see me
You didn't see me though
So gone, haven't seen myself in like a week or so
Oh, all the places people go
I don't sleep, I'm always dreamin' though, yeah

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
There is nothin' (Yeah,) to fear (Yeah, whoa-whoa-whoa)
Unless nobody is here (Whoa-whoa-whoa)
And as my head kisses my bed, it'll be a while 'til I see you again
Girl, you're just like (Just like,) my pillow (My pillow)

[Outro]
You just like (My pillow,) my pillow
You just like (My pillow)

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, um
Who put the spiders in my applesauce?
Took the pins out my hand grenade?
Somebody said that I deserve to die
I looked him in the eye and said the devil's not circumcised
Who put spiders in my applesauce?
Took the pins out my hand grenade?
Somebody told that I deserve to die
I looked him in the eye and said the devil not circumcised

[Verse 1]
So play me a song on the guitar
Got a rainforest in my cigar
There's knots in my yo-yo string
Put a crown on my stallion, I'm the Polo king
I fell in love with a go-go dancer, she's a single mom
The underdog, I like to play the game with Diddy Kong
She the god type, throw that bitch a Klondike
Everything is alright, see it's written in the Psalms
I told her I get rich off my little songs
Gave her a billion reasons that she should come along
Immediately, she dropped her shit
But everywhere I go, they told me "Watch your bitch!"
God damn! I guess I got another one
Good vibrations, Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch
I put the gourmet flavors inside the honey blunt
Got my head underwater but I ain't comin' up
Fuck air, my bitch's ass is like a plump pear
And she ain't pretty or ugly, I say she's just fair
Man this life is unfair

[Chorus]
Okay I'm parkin' lot pimpin', I got nothin' to lose
And I'ma do this 'til I'm a hundred and two
Why you tryna stunt when we stuntin' on you?
I said I'm parkin' lot pimpin', I got nothin' to do
And I'ma do this 'til I'm a hundred and two
Why you tryna stunt when we stuntin' on you?
Stuntin' in the Uber
Stuntin' on you

[Verse 2]
I'm readin' old Playboy magazines
Somethin' from the 50's when the journalism had its peak
You play the background, you just a member of the faculty
I'm actually out here decision makin'
Had to get my shit together, I was missin' payments
I just pray to God that my lady isn't famous
She threw the gown on and we hit the banquet
She got her own story; just let the bitch explain it:

[Open Verse]

[Chorus]
Okay I'm parkin' lot pimpin', I got nothin' to lose
And I'ma do this 'til I'm a hundred and two
Why you tryna stunt when we stuntin' on you?
I said I'm parkin' lot pimpin', I got nothin' to do
And I'ma do this 'til I'm a hundred and two
Why you tryna stunt when we stuntin' on you?
Stuntin' in the Uber
Yeah, bitch, I'm stuntin' in the Uber
Yeah, bitch, I'm stuntin' in the Uber

[Intro]

Uh, uh, uh, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo
Yo, now

[Verse 1]
I got a little bit of money fillin' my pockets
Roll around like I run this shit
I got a system filled up with toxins(Toxins)
I've been broken-hearted, now it's fuck that bitch
Getting high to deal with my problems(Problems)
Fucking bitches, getting drunk as shit
But these bitches getting obnoxious(Obnoxious)
They nothin' to me though I love this shit
Go long days, longer nights
Talk too much, the wrong advice
All the lights and call my life
Doctor, doctor, will you help me?
Get me healthy
Keep it low, this where hell be
Ain't shit you can tell me now
Fuck this rap shit, bitch, I'm sellin' out
Ooh shit, with my new bitch you jealous now
Smokin' weed at the crib watching Belly now
All the pain that they causin'
Like, fuck it, we ballin'
Now everythin' straight
You feeling the feeling
I'm chilling, just living
I'm burning away
Conversations we having
I'm getting too static
Too much on my plate
Lord, I need me a break

[Chorus]
But I'll be good by the weekend, yeah
I'll be good by the weekend, yeah
Everything good by the weekend, yeah
Everything will be good by the weekend, by the weekend

[Post-Chorus]
We going out tonight, yeah, we going out tonight, like fuck it
We going out tonight, yeah, we going out tonight, fuck it
We going out tonight, yeah, we going out tonight (It's a weekend)
We going out tonight, yeah, we going out tonight (It's a weekend)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I been having trouble sleeping
Battling these demons
Wondering what's the thing that keeps me breathing
Is it money, fame or neither?
I been thinking about the places that I frequent
All the people that I see
I’m just out here livin' decent
What do it mean to be a G?
And all the time we fall behind
Bitches in the concubine
I call her mine, crazy
She ain't' God as I
I make water wine
Pause in time
It's common, they often hate me
Never will I walk in line
I cross the T's and dot the I's
Wondering, well, wonderin' how I got this high
Fell asleep and forgot to die, God damn
I'm poppin' them downers
And drinkin' them powders, faded
Get it over the counter
I'm stuck on the browser
Like, how did I make it?
These bitches don't know me
This shit is so lonely until she get naked
Don't even know what today is

[Chorus]
But I'll be good by the weekend, yeah
I'll be good by the weekend, yeah
Everything good by the weekend, yeah
Everything will be good by the weekend, by the weekend

[Post-Chorus]
We going out tonight, yeah, we going out tonight, like fuck it
We going out tonight, yeah, we going out tonight, fuck it
We going out tonight, yeah, we going out tonight (It's a weekend)
We going out tonight, yeah, we going out tonight (It's a weekend)

[Intro: bearface]
It's seven o'clock on the dot, I'm in the drop-top
Your legs on the dashboard (Your legs on the dashboard, oh)
So tell me what I'm to do whenever I'm missin' you?
Tell me, do you love me? I, I

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
I move mountains on my own, don't need nobody's help
I've been lookin' after me like only I can watch my back
Lovin' me and it keeps hurtin' me
I hate it when I lose control over my heart
You know you really turned me on, right from the start
Just to hear you call my name, I call to God
Selfishly, I keep it all for me
Usually, I don't wait too long, but for you, I might

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty & Dua Lipa]
Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
I don't wanna blink and see you out (Haha, I don't, no shade)
Pressed up on my body, like no doubt (No, no, no doubt, no doubt)
I don't want us movin' too fast (Fast, play your part, play your part)
That's a damn shame, but it gon' make your man insane

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty & Dua Lipa]
Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

[Verse 3: Jon B]
Show me all the sugar I've been patient for
Pour some more of your sugar on me
Show me all the sweet things you've got in store
Pour some more of your sugar on me
Where's the sweet thing, when I need some more, babe?
Show me some sugar when I'm feelin' lonely
Obvious why we relatin', baby, just don't keep me waitin'
Come be my sugar, baby

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty & Dua Lipa]
Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract & Jon B & Ryan Beatty]
Back and forth
I'll take that if that's all you askin' for
With my legs up on the dashboard
Only thing in my pocket is my passport, pa-passport (So don't run)
Taken my heart, all over again
Watchin’ my man, watchin' his body
Look at his body, oh-oh
Oh-oh (Passport)

[Outro: bearface, Joba & Kevin Abstract]
So, do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me? Oh
I'm your candyman
I'll be your candyman
I'm your candyman (Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah)
(Candy, candy, candy, candy, uh)
I'm your candyman (Candy, uh)
I'll be your candyman (Candy, uh)
I'm your candyman

[Intro: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
It's getting better all the time

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney (& John Lennon)]
I used to get mad at my school (No, I can’t complain)
The teachers who taught me weren't cool (No, I can't complain)
You’re holding me down (Ah-ah), turning me 'round (Ah-oh)
Filling me up with your rules (Fool, you fool)

[Chorus: Paul McCartney (& John Lennon and George Harrison)]
I've got to admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get no worse)
I have to admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Me used to be angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word, I finally heard
I’m doing the best that I can

[Chorus: Paul McCartney (& John Lennon and George Harrison)]
I’ve got to admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can’t get no worse)
I have to admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine
Getting so much better all the time!

[Post-Chorus: Paul McCartney (& John Lennon)]
It’s getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)
It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)

[Verse 3: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man, I was mean but I'm changing my scene
And I'm doing the best that I can (Fool, you fool)

[Chorus: Paul McCartney (& John Lennon and George Harrison)]
I admit it's getting better (Better)
A little better all the time (It can't get no worse)
Yes, I admit it's getting better (Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine
Getting so much better all the time!

[Post-Chorus: Paul McCartney (& John Lennon)]
It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)
It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)

[Outro: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Getting so much better all the time!

[Verse 1]
Do you fear, that you'll have no control?
You walk through this world with your head above water
Shoes made of copper, just trying to float
The lakes frozen over, look down at yourself
What's staring back doesn't please you
The man don't believe you, he sees through the lies that you tell
Cards in your hand, you're looking at nothing
(Your call has been forwarded to an automated voice-)
You wonder when God will just listen and give you a break
And he says, "See, living and dying are one and the same"
(Your call has been forwarded to an automated-)

[Chorus]
Do they dream just like we do?
Do they dream just like we do?
Do they love just like we do?
Do they love just like we do?
Do they feel just like we do?
Do they feel just like we do?

[Verse 2]
Do you know anything at all?
You've been waiting for answers as parades and dancers keep building your castle so strong
The moon made of water, you swim to the shore
You can try your best escape and the universe is breaking, you say you can't take it no more
The pressure is building like buildings you jumped from
Wishing that wishing could lift this conundrum
The streets that you walk on are shallow
But do you feel as big as your shadow?

[Bridge]
No-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
No-oh-oh, oh-oh
No-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
No, no, no, no-oh

[Chorus]
Do they dream just like we do?
Do they dream just like we do?
Do they love just like we do?
Do they love just like we do?
Do they feel just like we do?
Do they feel just like we do?

[Verse 3]
Said, If you could make—, if you could make—, if you could make—, if you could make—, if you could make—
If you could make—, if you could make—, if you could make, it go away
Give you a chance to start all over

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
Now that our love's dying out
And there’s no laughter left around
And there's a weakness in my soul
Now that I am going it alone (Hey)

[Pre-Chorus]
Now that you're sober, feelings are over
Will you remember then
The things that I will not forget?
I know that you ain't gonna stay
But will you bring flowers to the grave?

[Chorus]
I'm gonna bury my heart
Six feet under the ground
Today it's over, I'm letting go
I'm buried right from the start
We knew we'd tear us apart
We're burning down while the river flows

[Verse 2]
We were once us, now we're none
Yeah, we were tied, but now undone
Oh, darling, I want you to know
That I never wanted you to go (Hey)

[Pre-Chorus]
Now that you're sober, feelings are over
Will you remember then
The things that I will not forget?
I know that you ain't gonna stay
But will you bring flowers to the grave?

Six feet under the ground
Today it's over, I'm letting go

[Verse 1]
Not on me, not again, you can't tell me who I am
It’s alright, it's okay, I won't tell them either way
M****** says, "Don’t you know you'd feel better all alone"
Times have changed, can't complain, here's the fee, time to pay

[Chorus]
Nothing's free
Nothing's free

[Verse 2]
Pushing eighty on the five as I try to clear my mind
It's alright, it's okay, I won’t tell them anything
I can see her in the haze as she tells me that I’ve changed
As I stop and I think all the things they'll take from me

[Chorus]
’Cause nothing's free
I don't wanna push it if it's not your time
Nothing’s free
I don't wanna push it if it's not your time
Nothing's free

[Outro]
I don't wanna push it if it's not your time
Nothing's free

[Verse 1]
Joan was quizzical; studied pataphysical science in the home
Late nights all alone with a test tube, oh, oh, oh, oh
Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine calls her on the phone
"Can I take you out to the pictures, Joa-oa-oa-oan?"
But as she's getting ready to go, a knock comes on the door

[Chorus]
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon her head
Klang! Klang! Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that she was dead

[Verse 2]
Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times "I must not be so, o, o, o"
But when she turns her back on the boy, he creeps up from behind

[Chorus]
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon her head
(Do-do-do-do)
Klang! Klang! Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that she was dead

[Bridge]
Do-do-do-do

[Verse 3]
P. C. 31 said, "We caught a dirty one.", Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures, oh, oh, oh, oh
Rose and Valerie, screaming from the gallery, say he must go free
(Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them so-o-o-o
But as the words are leaving his lips, a noise comes from behind

[Chorus]
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon his head
Klang! Klang! Maxwell's silver hammer made sure he was dead

[Outro]
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo
Silver hammer man

[Verse 1]
Oh! Darling, please believe me
I'll never do you no harm
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm

[Verse 2]
Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I beg you
Don't ever leave me alone

[Chorus]
When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me that you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly fell down and died

[Verse 3]
Oh! Darling, if you leave me
I'll never make it alone
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm
Believe me, darling

[Chorus]
When you told me (woo!) you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly broke down and cried
When you told me you didn't need me anymore
Well, you know I nearly fell down and died

[Verse 4]
Oh! Darling, please believe me
I'll never let you down
(Oh! Believe me, darling)
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never do you no harm

[Chorus]
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade

[Verse 1]
He’d let us in, knows where we’ve been
In his octopus’s garden in the shade
I’d ask my friends to come and see
An octopus’s garden with me

[Chorus]
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade

[Verse 2]
We would be warm below the storm
In our little hide-a-way beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus’s garden near a cave
We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can’t be found

[Chorus]
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade

[Verse 3]
We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they’re happy and they’re safe
We would be so happy, you and me
No-one there to tell us what to do

[Chorus]
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden with you
In an octopus’s garden with you
In an octopus’s garden with you

[Verse]
I want you
I want you so bad
I want you
I want you so bad, it's driving me mad
It's driving me mad

Here comes the sun, doo-dun doo-doo
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

[Verse 1]
Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here

[Chorus]
Here comes the sun, doo-dun doo-doo
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

Little darling, the smile's returning to their faces
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here

Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear

Because the world is round it turns me on
Because the world is round

[Verse 2]
Because the wind is high it blows my mind
Because the wind is high

[Bridge]
Love is old, love is new
Love is all, love is you

[Verse 3]
Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry
Because the sky is blue

[Verse 1]
You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down

[Verse 2]
I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation
I break down

[Verse 3]
Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any jobber got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go
But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Nowhere to go

[Verse 4]
One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true today
Came true today
Came true today
Yes, it did

[Outro]
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
All good children go to Heaven
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
All good children go to Heaven

All good children go to Heaven
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
All good children go to Heaven

All good children go to Heaven
(One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
All good children go to Heaven
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
All good children go to Heaven)

[Verse 1]
Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

[Verse 2]
His sister Pam works in a shop
She never stops, she's a go-getter
Takes him out to look at the Queen
Only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man

[Verse 1]
Well, you should see Polythene Pam
She's so good-looking but she looks like a man
Well, you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag
Yes, you should see Polythene Pam
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl that makes "The News of the World"
Yes, you could say she was attractively built
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Great!

[Intro]
"Listen to that, Mal
Oh look out! It's-"

[Verse 1]
She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

[Chorus]
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me

[Verse 2]
She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew what I could not say
And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal, but she could not rob

[Chorus]
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me, oh yeah

[Chorus]
Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

[Verse]
Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles await you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

[Chorus]
Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby

[Chorus]
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse]
I never give you my pillow
I only send you my invitations
And in the middle of the celebrations
I break down

[Chorus]
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

[Transition]

[Verse 1]
Oh yeah, alright
Are you going to be in my dreams
Tonight?

[Drum and Guitar Solos]

[Bridge]
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love

[Verse 2]
And in the end
The love you take
Is equal to the love you make

[Verse]
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
But she doesn't have a lot to say
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
But she changes from day to day
I want to tell her that I love her a lot
But I gotta get a bellyful of wine
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
Someday I'm going to make her mine, oh yeah
Someday I'm going to make her mine

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
It was twenty years ago today
When Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play
They've been going in and out of style
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile
So may I introduce to you
The act you've known for all these years
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

[Bridge: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you will enjoy the show
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Sit back and let the evening go
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
It's wonderful to be here
It's certainly a thrill
You're such a lovely audience
We'd like to take you home with us
We'd love to take you home

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
I don't really want to stop the show
But I thought you might like to know
That the singer's going to sing a song
And he wants you all to sing along
So let me introduce to you
The one and only Billy Shears
And Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band

[Segue: The Beatles]
Billy Shears!

[Verse 1: Ringo Starr]
What would you think if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key

[Chorus: Ringo Starr]
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mh, I get high with a little help from my friends
Mh, gonna try with a little help from my friends

[Verse 2: Ringo Starr & The Beatles]
What do I do when my love is away?
Does it worry you to be alone?
How do I feel by the end of the day?
Are you sad because you're on your own?

[Chorus: Ringo Starr]
No, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mh, get high with a little help from my friends
Mh, gonna try with a little help from my friends

[Bridge: Ringo Starr & The Beatles]
Do you need anybody?
I need somebody to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love

[Verse 3: Ringo Starr & The Beatles]
Would you believe in a love at first sight?
Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time
What do you see when you turn out the light?
I can't tell you, but I know it's mine

[Chorus: Ringo Starr]
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mh, get high with a little help from my friends
Oh, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends

[Bridge: Ringo Starr & The Beatles]
Do you need anybody?
I just need someone to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love

[Outro: Ringo Starr]
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mh, gonna try with a little help from my friends
Oh, I get high with a little help from my friends
Yes, I get by with a little help from my friends
With a little help from my friends

[Verse 1]
Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

[Verse 2]
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high

[Pre-Chorus]
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

[Verse 3]
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly, someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

[Chorus]
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go

[Verse 1]
I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where it will go

[Verse 2]
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong, I'm right
Where I belong, I'm right
Where I belong
See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door

[Verse 3]
I'm painting the room in a colorful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go
Ooh, ah
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Verse 4]
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong, I'm right
Where I belong, I'm right
Where I belong

[Verse 5]
Silly people run around, they worry me
And never ask me why they don't get past my door
I'm taking the time for a number of things
That weren't important yesterday
And I still go
Ooh, ah

[Chorus]
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
Where it will go

[Outro]
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes down the stairs to the kitchen clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside, she is free

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & (John Lennon)]
She (We gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving (Sacrificed most of our lives)
Home (We gave her everything money could buy)
She's leaving home after living alone (Bye-bye)
For so many years

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband, Daddy, our baby's gone
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
She (We never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)
Home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home after living alone (Bye-bye)
For so many years

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & (John Lennon)]
She (What did we do that was wrong)
Is having (We didn't know it was wrong)
Fun (Fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
Something inside that was always denied (Bye-bye)
For so many years
She's leaving home (Bye-bye)

[Verse 1]
For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanque's Fair, what a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In his way Mr. K. will challenge the world!

[Verse 2]
The celebrated Mr. K
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring don't be late
Messrs. K. and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten somersets he'll undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill

[Verse 1: George Harrison]
We were talking about the space between us all
And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late when they pass away
We were talking about the love we all could share
When we find it to try our best to hold it there with our love
With our love, we could save the world, if they only knew

[Chorus 1]
Try to realise it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
We were talking about the love that's gone so cold
And the people who gain the world and lose their soul
They don't know, they can't see, are you one of them?

[Chorus 2]
When you've seen beyond yourself then you may find
Peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see we're all one
And life flows on within you and without you

[Sounds of Laughter]

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
When I get older losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you

[Verse 4: Paul McCartney]
I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride

[Verse 5: Paul McCartney]
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

[Verse 6: Paul McCartney]
Every summer we can rent a cottage
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck, and Dave

[Verse 7: Paul McCartney]
Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away

[Verse 8: Paul McCartney]
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

[Outro]
Whoo!

[Hook]
Lovely Rita, meter maid
Lovely Rita, meter maid

[Verse 1]
Lovely Rita, meter maid
Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away
Standing by a parking meter
When I caught a glimpse of Rita
Filling in a ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man
Lovely Rita, meter maid (Lovely Rita)
May I inquire discreetly (Lovely Rita)
When are you free to take some tea with me?

[Bridge]
Rita!

[Verse 2]
Took her out and tried to win her
Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again
Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home, I nearly made it
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two
Oh, lovely Rita meter maid
Where would I be without you
Give us a wink and make me think of you

[Hook]
Lovely Rita meter maid
Lovely Rita meter maid (Rita meter maid)
Lovely Rita meter maid (Oh Lovely Rita, meter maid)
Lovely Rita meter maid
Ah da, ah da, ah da, ah da
Ah da, ah da, ah da, ah da
Ah da, ah da, ah da, ah da
Ah da, ah da, ah da, ah da

[Intro]
Good morning, good morning
Good morning, good morning
Good morning

[Verse 1]
Nothing to do to save his life, call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day, how's your boy been?
Nothing to do, it's up to you
I've got nothing to say but it's OK
Good morning, good morning
Good morning

[Verse 2]
Going to work, don't want to go, feeling low down
Heading for home, you start to roam, then you're in town
Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed, it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep
And you're on your own, you're in the street

[Verse 3]
After a while you start to smile, now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing has changed, it's still the same
I've got nothing to say but it's OK
Good morning, good morning
Good morning

[Verse 4]
People running round, it's five o'clock
Everywhere in town it's getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life
It's time for tea and Meet The Wife

[Verse 5]
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here
Watching the skirts, you start to flirt, now you're in gear
Go to a show, you hope she goes
I've got nothing to say, but it's OK
Good morning, good morning
Good...

[Outro]
Good morning, good morning
Good
Good morning, good morning
Good
Good morning, good morning
Good
Good morning, good morning
Good
Good morning, good morning
Good
Good morning, good morning
Good
Good morning, good morning
Good
Good morning, good morning
Good

[Verse: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
We're Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you have enjoyed the show
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We're sorry but it’s time to go
Sgt. Pepper's lonely, Sgt. Pepper's lonely
Sgt. Pepper's lonely, Sgt. Pepper's lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We'd like to thank you once again
Sgt. Pepper's one and only Lonely Hearts Club Band
It’s getting very near the end
Sgt. Pepper’s lonely, Sgt. Pepper's lonely
Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They’d seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book

[Refrain: John Lennon]
I'd love to turn you on

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
*Alarm clock rings*
Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
I read the news today, oh boy
Four-thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall

[Refrain: John Lennon]
I'd love to turn you on

[Instrumental Outro]
Lyrics from Snippet

...gotcha now, baby
I bet ya know, hey
We got our lives from his soul
Done now...

[Chorus 1]
Let me take you down
Cause I'm going to strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever

[Verse 1]
Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone
But it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me

[Verse 2]
No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you can't, you know, tune in
But it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad

[Chorus 2]
Let me take you down
Cause I'm going to strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever

[Verse 3]
Always know sometimes think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think I know I mean, ah yes
But it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree

[Chorus 3]
Let me take you down
Cause I'm going to strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever
Strawberry fields forever
Strawberry fields forever

[Alternative Ending]

[Chorus]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

[Verse 1]
Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone, but it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me

[Chorus]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

[Verse 2]
No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you can't, you know, tune in, but it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad

[Chorus]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

[Verse 3]
Always, no, sometimes think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think a "no", I mean, a "yes", but it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree

[Chorus]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever

[Verse 1]
In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello

[Verse 2]
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain
Very strange

[Chorus 1]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back

[Verse 3]
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine

[Piccolo trumpet solo]

[Chorus 2]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

[Verse 4]
Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway

[Verse 5]
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting, waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain
Very strange

[Chorus 1]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

[Chorus 2]
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane
Take 2!

John: 1, 2, 3, 4....

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go

[Verse 2]
I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where it will go

[Bridge 1]
And it really doesn't matter
If I'm wrong
I'm right where I belong
I'm right where I belong
Silly people standing there
Who disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door

[Verse 3]
I'm painting a room in a colorful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go
Ooh ooh ooh aah aah
Hey, hey, hey
Hey

[Bridge 1]
And it really doesn't matter
If I'm wrong
I'm right where I belong
I'm right where I belong
Silly people runnin' round
They worry me and never ask me why they don't get past my door

[Verse 4]
I'm taking the time for a number of things
That weren't important yesterday
And I still go
Ooh ooh ooh aah aah

[Outro]
Fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go, oh
Where it will go, oh
Fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go, oh

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Why is it so hard to accept the party is over?
You came with your new friends
And her mom jeans and her new Vans
And she's perfect and I hate it
Oh so glad you made it
I'm so glad you could come by
Somebody get the tacos, somebody spark the blunt
Let's start the Narcos off at episode one
Bring the gin, got the juice
Bring the sin, got that too
Won't you just shut up, know you're my favorite
Am I...

[Chorus]
Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah
Tell me that it's warm enough here for ya
Is it warm enough for ya inside me, me, me, me?
Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah
Tell me that it's warm enough here for ya
Warm enough outside, inside me, me, me, me

[Verse 2]
I get so lonely, I forget what I'm worth
We get so lonely, we pretend that this works
I'm so ashamed of myself think I need therapy-y-y-y
I'm sorry I'm not more attractive
I'm sorry I'm not more ladylike
I'm sorry I don't shave my legs at night
I'm sorry I'm not your baby mama
I'm sorry you got karma comin' to you
Collect your soul, get it right

[Chorus]
Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah
Tell me that it's warm enough here for ya
Is it warm enough for ya inside me, me, me, me?
Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah
Tell me that it's warm enough here for ya
Warm enough outside, inside me, me, me, me

[Bridge]
Sorry, I just need to see you
I'm sorry I'm so clingy I don't mean to be a lot
Do you really wanna love me down like you say you do?
Give it to me like you say you do?
'Cause it's hard enough you got to treat me like this
Lonely enough to let you treat me like this
Do you really love me?
Or just wanna love me down, down, down, down?

[Chorus]
Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah
Tell me that it's warm enough here for ya
Is it warm enough for ya inside me, me, me, me?
Warm enough for ya outside baby, yeah

Warm enough outside, inside me, me, me, me

When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, “let it be”

Speaking words of wisdom, “let it be”

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom

[Verse 2]
And when the brokenhearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Yeah, there will be an answer
Let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

And when the night is cloudy, there is still a light that shines on me
Shine on 'til tomorrow, let it be
I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, yeah, let it be
There will be an answer
Let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

[Intro: Paul McCartney - Live in Melbourne, Australia 1975]
Thanks a lot folks
Tell you what, see if you remember this one
Once a jolly swag man-
Oh, its not that
I was just kidding

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

[Outro: Paul McCartney]
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

[Intro: Monty Python & (Young Thug)]
Some people say it's folly, but I'd rather have the lolly
With money, you can make a smash
There is nothing quite as wonderful as money, money, money, money
There is nothing like a newly minted pound
(Money, money, money, money)
Everyone must hanker for the butchness of a banker
It's accountancy that makes the world go 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round
You can keep your Marxist ways, for it's only just a phase
Money, money, money makes the world go 'round (Yee!)

[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug]
Monte Carlo, big sharks on my ankles (Monte Carlo)
I drape out all my broads, Cartier bangles (Cartier bangles)
I go military boys with the angles (Gah-gah, phew-phew)
Gotta upgrade the stars outer space for me (Yeah)

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Lotta blue cash in a rubber band (A lotta blue cash in the rubber)
Mount it up her ass, she in Barbie land (She in Barbie land)
Tropicana diamonds, rock 'em by the tens (By the tens)
I'm just drinkin' Act, Kurt Cobain (Cobains)

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Money on your dawg and go bust his brains (Grrt)
Leave him on the sidewalk like he gettin' a tan (Graow)
I grow micro-soft drinkin' oxygen (Graow)
Bitch, I been a boss since a god damn kid (Woo!)
Hop out on the block with a AK, make him do the cha-cha-cha (Skrrt, skrrt)
I rode the Dropbox with your bae and I got my rocks off, woo
(Got my rocks off)
She sucked the socks off of me and they was Gucci (Woo!)
I bent her over in the Bentley Spur and I didn't eat her coochie
(On God)
I'm livin' life as a pimp (Yeah)
I'll put a bitch on your shrimp (Yeah)
I'm high in the sky like a blimp (High)
Ooh, I'll cop a Rolls Royce first attempt (Skrrt)
What's the definition of real? Yeah, yeah, yeah
When you kneel, yeah, yeah, yeah
You just showin' you steal, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah (Let's go)

[Verse 2: Juice WRLD]
Fresh to death, Gucci on my tomb
My chopper sing, it need autotune
Bad bitch in my hotel room
Take a perky right before we fuck, then act a fool
Sad money, I got blue face diamonds
I'm at the top and I'm gonna keep on climbin'
I got a gun on my hip, no silence
I want these niggas to hear the violence
Momma told me, "Don't trust nobody"
Damn, momma, you seen it coming
That's why I don't keep this heat for nothin'
Try me, then you're gettin' one
Plus one and a couple more, uh
30 shots when I am all done
Right, right? Did I do the math right?
Stomp 'em out, wrath in my Rafs, feel my wrath

[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug]
Monte Carlo, big sharks on my ankles (Monte Carlo)

Caught my heartbeat, reeled me in
Tricked me softly, sink or swim
Drank your poison, paralyzed
Got so many sides, you’re a Gemini, I

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you got me, baby
Like a puppet, you’re controlling my soul
Whoa-oh
Twist me ‘round your body
More than fantasy, let’s get physical
Oh-whoa

Let’s get physical, baby
Let’s get physical, baby
I wanna get physical, baby
Let’s get physical baby

Caught my heartbeat, reeled me in
Tricked me softly...

[Intro]
Closer than...

[Verse 1]
I've got a habit
Of giving too much or too little
There's no in-between with me, you know
I'm impulsive and jealous and then ice cold

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know what's wrong with me
You're givin' me everything that I thought I wanted
More than being scared of commitment, it's self-sabotaging
Tryna communicate it better, so here's me being honest
Me being honest

[Chorus]
We've been gettin' closer than I've ever been (I've been)
And every time before, this is where it would end
It's not right, it's not right, it's not healthy
I'll make every mistake, but you get me
We're getting closer than I've ever been

[Post-Chorus]
But are we gonna cross the line?
But are we gonna cross the line?

[Verse 2]
I've got a habit
That's part of the problem, I'm like a landmine
Could go off any second, I know you don't mind
'Cause you're also a mess
But that mess is mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know what's wrong with me
You're givin' me everything that I thought I wanted
More than being scared of commitment, it's self-sabotaging
Tryna communicate it better, so here's me being honest
Me being honest

[Chorus]
We've been gettin' closer than I've ever been (Closer than, closer than)
And every time before, this is where it would end (Before, this is, before, this is)
It's not right, it's not right, it's not healthy
I'll make every mistake, but you get me
We're getting closer than I've ever been

[Post-Chorus]
But are we gonna cross the line?
But are we gonna cross the line?

[Chorus: Giveon]
Two-thirty, baby, won't you meet me by The Bean?
Too early, maybe later you can show me things
You know what it is whenever I visit
Windy city, she blowin' me kisses, no
Thirty degrees, way too cold, so hold me tight
Will I see you at the show tonight?
Will I see you at the show tonight?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Ayy, truck to the plane to the truck
Truck to the hotel lobby
Me, I go through underground garages
Presidential suite on deposit
Elevator up to the room
Shower up and then we hit the club
Touch down, gotta see what's up
Area code in my phone
What numbers do I still have?
Who do I know from the past?
Hit one, she say she got a man
Hit another one, it goes green
Must've changed phones on the team
'Member when you let me in between
That was 2017
All good, Chubbs will look around
Find one that seem my type
That my dawg and he know what I like
He done found me plenty in my life
Problem is, I meet a girl tonight
Then I go and treat her too nice
Galleria credit card swipes
I don't even know if she a wife

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
But I do know one thing though
Women, they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then, I'll sit my drunk ass on that runway
On this one way

[Chorus: Giveon]
Two-thirty, baby, won't you meet me by The Bean?
Too early, maybe later you can show me things
You know what it is whenever I visit
Windy city, she blowin' me kisses, no
Thirty degrees, way too cold, so hold me tight
Will I see you at the show tonight?
Will I see you at the show tonight?

[Verse 2: Drake]
Jewelry in the safe on arrival
Pistol on J for survival
Lot of people gunnin' for the title
Lot of people tryna take us viral
I'm just tryin' to have a nice night though
Waiter brought the check for the meal
She said, "Babe, I think there was a typo"
Nah, girl, I got it, that's light though
I could show you bigger things than that
It's gon' be a minute 'til I'm back
Let me give you images that last
AMEX had a limit in the past
I had plenty women in the past
I done plenty sinnin' in the past
You don't need to know, but you can ask
Stickin' on your backstage pass
All access 'cause you bad
You could go wherever with that ass
Show to the shower to the truck
Truck to the club for the party
You go in first with your girls
'Cause I don't know who's out there watchin'

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
But I do know one thing though
Women, they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday, Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then, I'll sit my drunk ass on that runway
On this one way

[Verse 1: The Kid LAROI]
I hope you know what you did to me
I'm grateful for what you did for me
You showed me that you ain't shit and these bitches is dangerous
Now I do 'em just how you did to me
And I know you see the pain in my eyes, every secret and lie
Got a reason to cry 'fore I sleep at night
I need my peace of mind, I see you fine
But I'm far from that, so—

[Pre-Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Now I'ma be savage, but you made it happen
And you made a habit (I get it now)
I wonder what happened
I thought we would last 'til we turn into ashes
Burnin' and crashin'
Why can't I get past it? (Why can't I get past?)
Damn, girl, you changed up the best way
I just feel sorry for my next one

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
'Cause I'ma be selfish, I'm gon' be selfish
And no one can change my mind
No one can help me
Oh, I'm gon' be selfish, I'm gon' be selfish
And no one can change my mind
No one can help me
Oh, I'm gon' be—

[Verse 2: The Kid LAROI]
Bad, bad, bad
Because I just can't do this again
Don't wanna feel like this again
So she has to
Now I'm up in LA, I'm with a bitch from the Bay
I'm tellin' her that I love her, but my feelings will fade (Oh woah, woah)
Because I'll find another and I'll tell her the same
Knowin' that I don't mean a thing I say (Say)

[Pre-Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
Now I'ma be savage, but you made it happen
And you made a habit (I get it now)
I wonder what happened
I thought we would last 'til we turn into ashes
Burnin' and crashin'
Why can't I get past it? (Why can't I get past?)
Damn, girl, you changed up the best way
I just feel sorry for my next one

[Chorus: The Kid LAROI]
'Cause I'ma be selfish, I'm gon' be selfish
And no one can change my mind
No one can help me
Oh, I'm gon' be selfish, I'm gon' be selfish
And no one can change my mind
No one can help me
Oh, I'm gon' be—

[Outro: JOY.]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Help me
You cannot help me
Oh-oh-oh, oh (Oh, oh)
You cannot save me, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 3]
When a tough nibba doin' something we would call sus
He droppin’ it and stoppin' it and askin' "What the fuck?"
"Do y'all really think I'd be a faggot thug?"
"Get that shit outta here it still me cuz"

And when you're dealing with DJ Clockwork
You're dealing with someone that

Psychopathic thinker, hyperactive drinker

Okay, like I was sayin', alright, said, um

My bitch is like a king cover, put it in her sphincter
Your bitch like a bad fart, all she do is linger

Ahead of y'all chillin', you lookin' at my blinkers
Rappers is bumblebees, pullin' out your stingers
Yeah, I'm gettin' high, smokin' weed again
Couple of my homies were on CNN
I changed the channel once they went into commercials
Yeah, delusional Waldo Emerson
Just like you, I love football and lesbians
Never deal with bitches, 'cause bitches are some thespians
Save the drama for your motherfuckin' mama
Oh Jesus, who's the rapper with the gold penis?
Put away your money, scrub, I ain't doin' no features
Say the motherfuckin' drill, bitch, I'm young Jehova
In the backyard with pads on, runnin' Oklahoma's
Get low
Ar-fifteens and Glock nines
She infesting me like a fungi
Fuck isis no landmines
Dripped down in jesus sandals
Jared Fogle that's a scandal
Kick that bitch, no door no handle
I am german but not Hansel and Grettle
Keep a Burna on me no heavy metal
Got more straps than the Taliban
Free my parents no travel ban
Go through that boy like a gamma ray
Thick booty slim waist no Sommer Ray
When I'm pissed get out of my way
Get the fuck out of my way
Get the fuck out of my way
Get the fuck out of my way

[Intro: OG Ron C]

[Chorus]
She moved out of state and shit done went left, she's seekin' forgiveness
She used to dance, but she want a loan to start up a business
Her daddy is not around, her mama is not around
I watch her climb to the top of the pole and then get to slidin' down
I make it rain in this bitch, I make it snow in this bitch
She tryna get out of the mix, shawty is goin' legit
Shawty is goin' legit, me, I'm supportin' this shit
This is a story, it came from my life and I'm just recordin' this shit

[Verse 1]
I'ma just give it to you direct, instead of me throwin' this shit
You know you important and shit
You know I'm supportin' this shit
We used to do pornos when you would come over but now you got morals and shit
I got like four on the wrist and an adorable kid
I got a Drac' in the studio, and I don't just mean that I'm in this bitch
Please make the most of this shit
Don't just come close to some shit
I give you this bread, you run me some head
And then you go glow up a bit

[Chorus]
She moved out of state and shit done went left, she's seekin' forgiveness
She used to dance, but she want a loan to start up a business

Shawty is goin' legit, me, I'm supportin' this shit
This is a story, it came from my life and I'm just recordin' this shit

[Verse 2]
Her daddy is not around, mama is definitely not around
She got a business plan, but she just ain't had time to write it down
Stay with her sister now, she got a man, but he out of town
Soon as he out of town, they hop in his whip and they ride around
I watch her climb to the top of the pole and then get to slidin', slidin'
Thought about trappin' a player before, but that just ain't right, right
Look in the mirror if you wanna look at some things on the bright side
You popped a 325, you feelin' too good to worry tonight

[Chorus]
She moved out of state and shit done went left, she's seekin' forgiveness
She used to dance, but she want a loan to start up a business
Her daddy is not around, her mama is not around
I watch her climb to the top of the pole and then get to s—
I make it rain in this bitch, I make it snow in this bitch
She tryna get out of the mix, shawty is goin' legit
Shawty is goin' legit, me, I'm supportin' this shit
This is a story, it came from my life and I'm just rec— ayy

Black boxes with the bow and rose
Zara heels bound to give ya Zara toes
Back that thing up, it's a wide load, shawty
I don't even know where the time goes, shawty
Know you got some brand new life goals
Baby blue, but you are not a baby, I know, shawty

So, why you gotta be so hard-headed?
Why you wanna ask? Girl, you know what I did
Actin' like you don't  already know what that is
Baby, just relax, I'm on your side
I will not discuss it with nobody
Neither of our pasts 'bout to go away
You made me forget about it anyway
I know, I know
Black boxes with the bow and rose
Little side hustle with the Fashion Nova
Know we both came from a broken home, shawty
Mom and daddy didn't really get along, shawty
Heard you got some brand new life goals
Baby blue, but you are not a baby, I know, shawty
I know, know, know, know, know

[Verse 1]
I think I did it again
I made you believe we're more than just friends, oh, baby
It might seem like a crush
But it doesn't mean that I'm serious

'Cause to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me, ooh, baby, baby

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
You see, my problem is this, I'm dreaming away
Wishing that heroes, they truly exist
I cry watching the days
Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways?

[Pre-Chorus]
But to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me, oh, baby, oh

She's a star, she's a star, she's a star
She's a star, she's a star, she's a star
She's a star, thinking
She's a star, thinking
She's a star, thinking

[Verse 1]
Early morning, she wakes up
Knock, knock, knock on the door
It's time for makeup, perfect smile
It's you they're all waiting for

[Pre-Chorus]
They go, "Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"
And they say

[Chorus]
"She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?"

[Verse 2]
Lost in an image, in a dream
But there's no one there to wake her up
And the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning
But tell me, what happens when it stops? Baby

[Pre-Chorus]
They go, "Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"
And they say

[Chorus]
"She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?"

[Verse 1]
It's you they're all waiting for
Baby baby baby

Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?
She is so lucky, but why does she cry?
If there is nothing missing in her life
Why do tears come at night?

"She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life

[Verse 1]
I go back to Alabama
Take a look at my life
What the fuck happened here?
I guess what they meant when
They paid the price
I go back to Alabama
Take a look at my life
Where are the trailer parks?
And where all the Christmas lights?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I had a boyfriend
He came from this town
We used to pretend we were married and start again
He read the Bible
Showed me what Jesus said
He said I should rewrite (He only read the red)

[Chorus]
I want Jesus to take me out this life, baby
And I talk to Jesus
And ask him if he'll think of saving me

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
I go back to Alabama
Take a look at my life
Nothing looks familiar here
No one even that I like
I go back to Alabama
Take a look at my life
I was so much happier when I was gonna be your wife

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We had a deal and
I fucked it up when
I made the decision to become someone
We had the one thing that no one ever had
True love
It's true love

[Chorus]
I ask Jesus to take me out this life baby
And I talk to Jesus
And ask him if he'll think of saving me

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Bridge]
I never meant to hurt you baby
It's so hard to be true
In this world where everything's so black and blue
I never meant to hurt you darling
It's so hard to be good
In this world where you do what you know you shouldn’t

[Chorus]
I want Jesus to take me out this life baby
And I talk to Jesus
And ask him if he'll think of saving me

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Intro]
Hmm, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Blackbirds will sing in the same key
As you play in the shoes that I bought you
And sweet baby Jane don't know a thing
About my songs, but she knows I'm a monsoon

[Chorus]
And, baby, you, all the things you do
And the ways you move, send me straight to Heaven
And, baby, you, what you never knew
What I never said is you're my living legend

[Verse 2]
Hipsters will sing just like a dream
In Sin-é or the back Brooklyn bayou
But you never cared about my name
And, darling, I never meant to defy you

[Chorus]
But baby, you, all them things you do
And those ways you moved, send me straight to Heaven
And baby you, I never said to you
You really are my living legend

[Bridge]
I got guns in the summertime and horses, too
Guns in the summertime and horses, too
I never meant to be bad or unwell
I was just living on the edge
Right between Heaven and Hell
And I'm tired of it

[Chorus]
Oh, all the things you do
And the ways you move, send me straight to Heaven
And, baby, you, what I never said to you
'Cause you really are my living legend

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
My living legend
My living legend
My living legend
My living legend

[Verse]
If you get lonely, darling just hold me
Prison isn’t going to keep me from you
Do like you told me, pick up and phone me
Use your one phone call and your ex-love boo
Nobody will have to know, that our love’s alive
Keep it on the low if you want to hide
I’ve got the same address that you left behind
On Greenwich Avenue, wishing and dreaming of you

[Chorus]
Living without you is like TV in black and white
Dark when I found you, touch me and turned on the light
When I’m around you, suddenly I realize
That I was blind before I saw the world through your eyes

[Verse]
If you get lonely think of this only
Heaven hasn’t forgotten about you
Remember Coney Island and how we
Went into the waves until the water’s blue
I won’t tell a single soul that you cry at night
Sit in single cells holding that pillow tight
Baby think of home, it will be alright
If you feel sad remember what we have

[Chorus]
Living without you is like TV in black and white
Dark when I found you, touch me to turn on the light
When I’m around you, suddenly I realize
That I was blind before I saw the world through your eyes

[Verse]
Being without you’s like when to live, no reprieve
Somewhere I’ve found you, flower bloom and I believe
That I have felt true love, I hope you never leave, never leave
So dry your eyes, dry your eyes
No bad surprises left in stored for you
And when you get home
You can change the tides and start anew, start anew
New new new new

[Chorus]
Living without you is like TV in black and white
Dark when I found you, touch me to turn on the light
When I’m around you, suddenly I realize
That I was blind before I saw the world through your eyes

[Chorus: Jay Rock & *Kendrick Lamar*]
*So what up Jay?*
Shit nothing but the money
*What you trying to say?*
More fifties more hundreds
*Who you trying to be?*
Who I already is
King of my city, that's no pop quiz

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Sitting in my Chevy smoking heavy on the best bud
Get it from the source
Got the best plug
Watts California be my city till the death bruh
You ain't hearing that?
Then you deaf blood
Moving like a snail
You can catch a slug
Hit you like a snare
I got big drums
Hunt for every dollar
I just stack funds
Yours is insufficient
That's why you mad huh?
Ever since I got a deal niggas hate me hard
So I keep a steel
Got no time to spar
Got no time to spare, money on my mind
Like hair
Like a flight of steps
All a nigga get is stairs
Big bag of green
Looking like a pear
When I hit a club
I'm leaving with a pair
Nigga I don't care
Bitch I'm a baller
Crash my whip today and cop another one tomorrow

[Chorus 2: Jay Rock & *Kendrick Lamar*]
*So what up Jay?*
Shit nothing but the money
*What you trying to say?*
More fifties more hundreds
*Who you trying to be?*
Who I already is
King of my city, that's no pop quiz
*So what up Jay?*
Shit nothing but the money
*What you trying to say?*
More fifties more hundreds
*Who you trying to be?*
Who I already is
King of my city, gotta get it how I live

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Me without a dollar is like a scholar with no smarts (whats that?)
That don't make sense don't it? (mm-mmh)
I'm in a Lamborghini with a Brazilian woman (oh yeah?)
Miss Novocaine
Suck my dick till she numb it (god damn)
You fly like a plane
But I'm more like a comet
Soaring over the atmosphere
I can hear the aliens cheer (ha)
Victory is sweet my dear (mm-hmm)
Here's the technique my dear (mm-hmm)
And maybe you can duplicate me
It's weird how y'all never can progress within the process
Of making residuals
I guess that you ain't I yet
Try to interfere with the dinero that I get
Watch y'all bear arms like women rub on my triceps duddy
Y'all is funny to me
You thought I came by myself nope
It's money with me
It's the root of all evil, but the need of all people
Yours is frail
I weigh mines on Brannon Scales

[Chorus: Jay Rock & *Kendrick Lamar*]
*So what up Jay?*
Shit nothing but the money
*What you trying to say?*
More fifties more hundreds
*Who you trying to be?*
Who I already is
King of my city, that's no pop quiz
Here, you focus
So I can see your faces
The eyes are wrong
How will I know if it's working right?

Light confuses
The tiny isles of bruises
The mangled lines
I see the signs of aging

But if I try to feel at all I am deceived
My mind's affected
It's empty now
As I lay down
I feel alright
My heart is racing

But if I try to feel at all I am deceived
My mind's affected
It's empty now
As I lay down
I feel alright
My heart is racing
Turn the noise on
(noise on)
I'd like to feel my poison
(my poison)
Assembly lines
Carry a velvet warning
To the yard
It's just like striking matches
The polish lies

But it's working in your blood
(working in your blood)
Which you know is not the same as love
(same as love, love)
Love is only in your mind
(only in your mind)
And not your heart
(heart)
No, it's working

It's working in your blood
(working in your blood)
Which you know is not the same as love
(same as love, love)
Love is only in your mind
(only in your mind)
And not your heart
(heart)
So tired, soul searching
I followed sounds to a cathedral
Imagine my surprise to find
That they were produced by Brian Eno

Past the gates, quite stark
The roses trimmed and the windows dark
I see the walls through a limestone crack
Not red not blue not yellow but black
And all the spaces left for you
If the sky was synthesized, you'd probably know

He taught me many things
The wisdom of oblique stratagems
The prophet of a sapphire soul
Presented through creative freedoms
And everything I say is true
Because if I was telling lies, it'd probably show

I can tell when he's kind of smiling
But what does he know? (What does he know?)
We're always one step behind him, he's Brian Eno (Brian Eno)
Brian Eno (Brian Eno)
When I was stuck he'd make me memorize elaborate curses
Tinctures and formulas to ditch the chori and flip the verses
My whole foundation came unglued
When I tried to humanize by ambient light

Dipping swords in metaphors, yeah, but what does he know?
(What does he know?)
We're always one step behind him, he's Brian Eno (Brian Eno)
Brian Eno (Brian Eno)

He promised pretty worlds and all the silence I could dream of
Brian Peter George St. John Le Baptiste de la Salle Eno

Well, all alone by the oldest stone where the shade trees grow
(What does he know?)
The creature by the water feature with the ghostly glow
(Brian Eno)
Making sure that time's preserved well, we reap what we sow
(What does he know?)

We're always one step behind him, he's Brian Eno (Brian Eno)

Yeah, I can tell that he's doing well, yeah, but what does he know?
(What does he know?)
I'm always one step behind him, he's Brian Eno
(Brian Eno)
Yeah, he dips swords in metaphors yeah, but what does he know?
(What does he know?)
I'd like to see him plant a forest, because I don't know
Brian Eno
He's making sure that time's preserved well, we reap what we sow
(What does he know?)
I'd like to see him plant a forest, because I don't know
Brian Eno
Yeah, I can tell that he's trying to smile, but what does he know?
(What does he know?)
I'll always be a step behind him, Brian Eno
(Brian Eno) Yeah
He's making sure that time's preserved well, we reap what we sow
(What does he know?)

[Verse 1]
You love the hell out of me
And Heaven's where we could be
I've stood on the edge of love
But never took the leap
And you took my armor off
And did it delicately
And I let my guard down
To show you what's underneath

[Pre-Chorus]
Thank God that you were man enough to come
Answer my mama's prayers
You asked the question, I said, "Yes"
But I'm scared

[Chorus]
'Cause I've never worn white
But I wanna get it right
Yeah, I really wanna try with you
No, I've never worn white
But I'm standin' here tonight
'Cause I really wanna say "I do"
I do

[Verse 2]
See us in sixty years with a full family tree (I do)
Give my blood, sweat, and tears to reach our destiny (I do)
'Cause love is a minefield, let's take this war, baby (I do)
'Cause at the end of it all, I choose you and you choose me (I do)

[Pre-Chorus]
Thank God I was woman enough to come
Answer your father's prayers
You asked the question
I could tell you were scared

[Chorus]
'Cause I've never worn white
But I wanna get it right
Yeah, I really wanna try with you
No, I've never worn white
But I'm standin' here tonight
'Cause I really wanna say "I do"

Now let's dance with each other (Dance with each other)
Mixing all of our colors

When you finally find forever

[Chorus]
No, I've never worn white, no
But I really wanna try with you
Yeah, I've never worn white
But I wanna get it right
'Cause I really wanna say "I do"

[Intro]
We got London on the track

[Chorus]
From stuffing rocks in my Polo socks
From stuffing rocks in my ho lil bra, stash
From in her purse to in her house, yeah

[Verse 1]
AK with the telescope, filet with a cherry coke
Enjoying the fruits of my labor, I pop that cherry hoe
Kush loud as a stereo, I got all these medicals
Powder bags of heavy snow, Eskimo, I'm askin' more
All that gas like Texico, all that ass you sexy ho
To my white girl, to my weed, that Mary Jane, that Mary Joe
Private planes and heavy doors, meeting bitches in metaphors
Like these singers poor like Singapore
From heaven's gates to the devil's doors
I'm joog, I'm hustling baby
All my money, I custom-made it
Numbers don't lie but people do
That's why they turn their back on you like 180
Degrees, please, I run with Gs
They got my back, I front me some keys
I smell a rat, they stunk up the streets
Now my peeps 'bout to come with them pumps, like Febreze

[Pre-Chorus]
Joog in a hundred degrees
Joog in the cold winter breeze
This yayo almost to my knees
I play in the snow til I freeze
She play with the snow til she sneeze
She way up, she in the nosebleeds
We break in your door for them keys
And you lay on your floor til we leave
Here to joog

[Chorus]
From stuffing rocks in my Polo socks
From stuffing rocks in my ho lil bra, stash
From in her purse to in her house, yeah
I hit a joog and then I bounce
Joog

[Verse 2]
I joog out the back of the Hummer
I joog out the back of the complex
I work that wrist like a Timex, I do it big, nigga, 5X
I did not give out no freebie, I don't play Let's Make a Deal
I'm taxing if you fake, nigga, I'm taxing if you trill
Work, work, I got that work, perc serving, I got them percs
All of these medicine bottles, balling like Cedric Ceballos
And nina just swallowed some hollows
Oh shit, that bitch 'bout to burp
And you know that it's fuck the world
So I put your dick in the dirt
Ball on a fuck nigga, spending paper
All these fuck nigga instigators
Fuck nigga head in a refrigerator
Chef 'bout to bring it to the dinner tables
My bitch do lines like printing paper
Had to hide the cocaine from the bitch
Had to hide the cocaine from the bitch
Had to hide the cocaine from the bitch
Just made another bitch love the dick
Just made another bitch cum cum
Who the motherfucker? I'm the motherfucker (Me)
Here come the undercovers, better run for cover
And when we under pressure we get overheated
And we overheated we turn on the army
And bring a hurricane to a thunderstorm
And leave your block looking like a slumber party
Too much stashed in my undergarments
Too much cash, that's an understatement
Too many hoes I could understand
But I'm losing all my wars to the undertaker
And I'm 'bout to make these hoes shake their money maker
And I fuck a bitch til she making funny faces
Jooging like that motherfucker Freddy Krueger
I'm jooging like that crazy motherfucker Jason
I'm jooging, these other niggas jig
You see not me, I joog, drive horses in that hood
Come through that bitch like vroom, vroom
Come through that bitch like ugh
Lil boy your bitch so ugh, my spoiled bitch so good
I'm oil rich, I'm good
Joog, joog, joog, I joog, joog, joog
Wish a nigga would, good, good
I leave his block like uhh uhh uhh
No Ceilings

[Chorus]
From stuffing rocks in my Polo socks
From stuffing rocks in my ho lil bra, stash
From in her purse to in her house, yeah
I hit a joog and then I bounce

[Bridge]
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, good
I'm good like I never been better
I'm good, I feel like more right than Betty

[Outro]
AK with the telescope, filet with lil cherry Coke

[Intro Chorus]
Dear I fear, we're facing a problem
You love me no longer, I know it
Just know I love you, just know I love you baby
And if it don't work out for some reason
"I tried" is an understatement
Just know I love you, you know I love you baby
And if it don't work out for some reason
It's probably your fault 'cause you always tripping and I'm always...
Just know I love you, you know I love you baby
And if it don't work out for some reason
"I tried" is an understatement
But just know I love you, you know I love you baby
And if it don't work out for some reason
It's probably your fault 'cause you always tripping and I'm always listening

[Verse 1]
You always crying, boo-hooing and sniffing
Think I'm always lying bout that one and this one
You always inquiring, fall back, mind your business
'Cause you see me with her don't mean that I'm with her
It was one night, I don't even remember
You think about the bitch more than I do
She don't think about you more than I do
Now you go get some new nigga
He can pretend to be all that you want
I won't befriend you
I'll just begin to continue the process of trying to forget you
Love is so mental
I bet you thought that shit wouldn't even get to a nigga like me though
But I am no robot
I take my key out your body, your door knob
And then watch some new nigga come knock that door down
The tables go 'round, go 'round
You know how this shit gon' go down
Since you Misses Know It All, I'm Mr. Know How
I know how to keep keep relationships low profile
But you want be seen, you want be envied
You don't want love, you want an image
'Cause I put real love right there in your face
You treat it like a blemish
Stop trying to be pretty, if you don't know anything baby

[Chorus]
Just know I love you, just know I love you baby
And if it don't work out for some reason
"I tried" is an understatement
But just know I love you, you know I love you baby
If it don't work out for some reason
It's probably your fault 'cause you always tripping and I'm always listening

[Verse 2]
We always bickering, Lord knows I'm sick of it
I can't continue this, I just want happiness
You just want benefits
How can I benefit from this whole situation when I'm limitless
When it comes to my feelings and my willingness
To blame your ignorance on an experience
Still take you serious, I'm such an idiot
I'm fucking risking it fucking with you girl, fucking with you girl
Should've know you was just something to do when there's nothing to do girl
Now you talking this shit 'bout my new girl, acting like a lil girl
You are now no longer in Wayne's world, welcome to the real world
I'ma just move on, you should just move on
It ain't about who right or who wrong
It's about living the type of life you want
No need for us to go back, there's no moon walking in this bitch
I tried too hard to make this shit work but it's too gone
So let's just be friends and bury the hatchet and read what it say on the tombstone
It says...

[Outro Chorus]
Just know I love you, just know I love you baby
And if it don't work out for some reason
"I tried" is an understatement
But just know I love you, you know I love you baby
If it don't work out for some reason
It's probably your fault 'cause you always tripping and I'm always...
Just know I love you, just know I love you baby
And if it don't work out for some reason
"I tried" is an understatement
But just know I love you, you know I love you baby
And if it don't work out for some reason
It's probably your fault 'cause you always tripping and I'm always...
Just know I love you, just know I love you baby
Just know I love you, just know I love you baby
Just know I love you, just know I love you baby
And if it don't work out for some reason
It's probably your fault 'cause you always tripping...
And I'm always listening

[Outro: The Cardigans Sample]
Dear, I fear we're facing a problem
You love me no longer, I know and
Maybe there is nothing that I can do
To make you do
Mama tells me...

[Verse 1: HoodyBaby & Lil Wayne]
You drive me crazy, I got road rage
My top down in the rain, it's a cold day
Gave you my heart, you let me die, that's a cold case
They say we running out of time, I walked the whole race
I walked the whole race
All I ever wanted was someone to call my own (That's all)
All a nigga need is for you to call my phone (That's all)
All that talk about true love, truly wasn't true
And all that shit you you loved, you just wasn't you

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And I know that you ain't used to hearing me at a tempo this slow
But I just had to slow it down and break it down
So you can hear me when I say

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I need you
I'm nothing without you
A zero without you, baby
I need you
I'm nothing without you
A zero without you, baby

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
You ain't even told me "Happy New Year," yeah
You starting the year off with that bullshit
Fuck it, I'ma take a shot for you, cheers
I'ma do me better than you did
You don't like it when I talk like that
But you don't bite, you just bark right back, with your dog ass
I feel played, you rained on my parade
But that's on me, I should've checked the forecast
And you don't like it when I talk like that
Hang up in my face and call right back, with your crazy ass
But that's okay 'cause when he throw you away
One man's treasure was another one's trash

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And I know that you ain't used to hearing me at a tempo this slow
But I just had to slow it down and break it down
So you can hear me when I say

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I need you
I'm nothing without you
A zero without you, baby
I need you
I'm nothing without you
A zero without you, baby

[Verse 3: HoodyBaby & Lil Wayne]
All that talk about true love, guess it wasn't true
All that shit you said you love, guess you wasn't you
I don't even wanna talk about it, no not a word
You drive me crazy, I got road rage, I'm fucking up the curb
You gon' get what you deserve, a house on a hill
A man to pay the bills but that nigga ain't real
Tell me what happened to trust? What happened to us?
You said you'd walk me through the bullshit like a crush but left me crushed

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
We don't even talk no more
We ran out of words to say, yeah
We don't even laugh no more
We ran out of games to play
Now that's cold

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And I know that you ain't used to hearing me at a tempo this slow
But I just had to slow it down and break it down
So you can hear me when I say

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I need you
I'm nothing without you
A zero without you, baby
I need you
I'm nothing without you
A zero without you, baby

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
A zero without you, baby
A zero without you, baby
A zero without you, baby
A zero without you, baby
A tempo this slow, a tempo this slow
But I just had to slow it down and break it down
So you can hear me when I say

Girl I, girl I just wanna

Wait a minute

Wait a minute, ain't my business where you going
Wait a minute, I just want some before you go and
Wait why you in your feelings when I wanna feel something?
Why you in your purse when I want to tell you something?
Why you on the phone after 2 in the morning?
Who the fuck you talking to at 2 in the morning, girl?

And I rise up
And I rise up
And I rise up
And I rise up
I rise up

[?]
I rise up

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, and so I rise
The news on TV, I roll my eyes
The good and the bad, it's do or die
Like a snake with two heads saying "Blow out mines"
Lord knows I'm trying, I just hope I'm fine
If I live to see tomorrow, Lord you're too kind
And I know in due time it'll be the end of time
So if I buy some time that's some expensive time
Until my time is up I'm in the sky's above
My eyes may be closed but I'm alive enough
My eyes may be red, I seen a lot of bloods
Started from the bottom, now it's bottoms up
Got a couple questions, no response to one
That's live for who? And that's die for what?
I know I'm the guy that only God can judge
I'ma rise up til I rise above, yeah
Tunechi

[Chorus: Andra Day]
And I rise up (Tunechi)

Yeah, this is the mic check, I can't hear, alright
Alright, oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Smoking on the good kush, sipping on the codeine
Spitting all this fire, living off the proceeds
Tipping on 44, pimping all your hoes
We gon' do  it bigger than she ever did with your ass
Sleeping on Polo, I don't got no doors
Can't forget she in love with the coco
Hustling on the low-low, duffle bag, YOLO
And I'ma laugh to the bank on you bitches, no joke, yeah

[Chorus]
You ain't gang, gang, gang
You ain't squad, squad, squad

[Verse 1]
Fake nigga lie to a real nigga
That's just some shit that you don't do
I used to wake up to the sun too
Now I wake up everyday to a lawsuit
Now my pills kicking in like kung-fu
Dipped the blunt in the syrup like fondue
I shoot up everybody in a carpool
I'm the shit with these bars, call it barstool
I'll knock a nigga ass to the north pole
I'll beat a triggerman in a heartbeat
I'll leave his heart beating at his own feet
Take his car keys, ride around til it's on E
My homies all know that it's on me
And if it's on me we gon' eat like we never ate
Have a second plate, nigga gotta eat everyday
Feeding heavyweights
Nigga trying to see better days, lord knows
Ain't no such thing as second place
No such thing as yesterday, ain't no such thing as tomorrow
And promises is for hoes, and diamonds is all gold
If you fucking with my squad though, it be clean up, aisle 4
That's just how it go, niggas slipping like Dial soap
Either I'm too high or the clouds low
And I go Michael Myers, psycho lion, hyperwire, mic on fire
Bad bitch, tight attire, treat me like I'm siar, like a giant
Play below the belt and I'm Orion
My oh my, my flights is higher, price is higher
Life inspired by the riots, I'm a rider, can't deny it
Can't describe it, can't disguise it, advertise it

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm smoking on the good kush, sipping on the codeine
Spitting all this fire, living off the proceeds
My bitch got that good juice
My plug got them low fees
I'm laughing to the bank though
'Cause these lil niggas joking

[Chorus]
You ain't gang, gang, gang
You ain't squad, squad, squad
You ain't gang, gang, gang
You ain't squad, squad, squad, no
You ain't gang, gang, gang

Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang
Squad, squad, squad, squad, squad, squad, squad up
Tied up, job done, woah

[Pre-Chorus]
Smoking on the good kush, sipping on the codeine
Spitting all this fire, living off the proceeds
Tipping on 44, pimping all your hoes
We gon' do  it bigger than she ever did with your ass
Sleeping on Polo, I don't got no doors
Can't forget she in love with the coco
Hustling on the low-low, duffle bag, YOLO
And I'ma laugh to the fucking bank, bitch no joke

[Chorus]
You ain't gang, gang, gang

[Chorus]
Gotta chase that money
Gotta chase that green
We are coming for the crowns
We are kings and queens
And we gon' be rich forever (Yah)
We gon' be rich forever (Mula)
Gotta chase that money (Yah)
Gotta chase that green (Yeah)
We are coming for the crowns
We are kings and queens (Uh, yeah)
And we gon' be rich forever (Mula, baby)
We gon' be rich forever (Yeah, Mula, bae)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Rich forever, sitting on leather
If you hating god bless you like you sniffed some pepper
I'm on an island where it's quiet and the fish is speckled
With a bitch I call JJ for jiggling Jello
Lord rich forever, kiss the bezel
Rubies in the watch face, it came with the freckles
Got a black card to pay for all the incidentals
And my house so big I hear my whispers echo
Lord rich forever, forever and a day
Trying not to confuse the gas pedal with the brake
I just made a multi-million dollar settlement today
I'm talking shit, you can't imagine all the peppermints I ate
A couple hundred thousand here, it keep the federal away
A couple hundred thousand there and now I'm settling a case
Walked straight up out the Rikers like I never spent a day
And the money like pussy, it's better when you chase, lord

[Chorus]
Gotta chase that money (Yeah)
Gotta chase that green (Woo)
We are coming for the crowns
We are kings and queens (Amen, yeah)
And we gon' be rich forever (Mula, baby, ah)
We gon' be rich forever (Yeah, Mula, baby)
Gotta chase that money (Yeah)
Gotta chase that green (

[?])
We are coming for the crowns (Yeah)
We are kings and queens (Can't stop money, nigga, no you can't)
And we gon' be rich forever (I-I woke up this morning and I looked in the mirror and I told myself, I said Tunechi)
We gon' be rich forever (Mula, baby)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Rich forever, lit forever
I'm higher than pitch and treble
I just sip and I twist them pedals
My bitch is special
I stay busy, she be salty like a twisted pretzel
Lord busy schedule, misfit rebel
When the money come, the bitch sing Christmas carols
Pistol several, rich but careful
Still wondering when they gon' make a triple barrel
Got money on my mind and I don't see a limit
Tell my girl I'm coming right now, I'ma be a minute
She said "The money more important" and now she offended
I say "You damn right," she say "Stop agreeing with me"
Niggas copy me and mimic, they just comedy and gimmicks
Put your money where your mouth is, I'ma be the dentist
I swear I'ma get the money constantly consistent
I'll be rich forever, I'ma be a minute, yeah

[Bridge]
No more late notices for the electric bill
No more heat knock up on your doors and we can barely get our fill
No more scraping by
No more living just to die

[Chorus]
Gotta chase that money (I'm a chase it)
Gotta chase that green (I'm chasing, I'm chasing)
We are coming for the crowns
We are kings and queens (And I won't be complacent)
And we gon' be rich forever (Mula, baby)
We gon' be rich forever (Young Mula, baby)
Gotta chase that money (I'm chasing)
Gotta chase that green (I'm chasing, I'm chasing)
We are coming for the crowns
We are kings and queens (Amen, Amen)
And we gon' be rich forever (I told her don't worry, because)
We gon' be rich forever (Amen, Amen)

[Chorus]

Hunnid miles an hour, blood pumpin', dammit, you a freak
G-Girl, I love your booty, goin' HAM on your booty meat
Girl, just watch me do it as I Dougie on your booty cheeks

Hydraulics in my car, nigga, watch me hit the switch

I'm Audi five-thousi like four Os
And I don't wear clothes, I call it wardrobe

[Interlude]
Put your lighters up, put your lighters up

[Bridge]
We poppin' bottles in the club and
Look at the ladies all up on us now
Could give a fuck about a hater
Countin' all this paper
Tell the DJ to play it back now
Come, girl, if you lonely
And you know you wanna whine with me, girl
And move your hips and sway
Pull up, pull up, DJ
Put your lighters in the air right now

[Chorus]
Put your lighters up, put your lighters up
Put your lighters up, put your lighters up
Put your lighters up, put your lighters up
Put your lighters up, put your hands in the air right now

Guess he wants to play, wants to play a lovegame, a lovegame

Hold me and love me
Just wanna touch you for a minute

Don't got no time to pretend
We're the real deal, sugar, we're a 100%, oh
And even though we must sometimes fight
I would die for you, I'd give you all of my life
Cause you're my passion, you're my fire and I need you so

With my angel wings and Fiorucci jeans

Close your eyes and lay back (Mhm)

I’ll be your baby girl, your baby girl
I’ll be your baby girl, your baby girl
I’ll be your baby girl, your baby girl
I’ll be your baby girl, your baby girl

[Verse 1]
A father, funny thing to call me
Or papa, tell me a story now
Never thought I'd be a daddy
This is crazy now
Nine months are right around the corner
Mommy's moody, she don't wanna be bothered
She's growing, her belly's getting bigger
I'm knowing that we're really getting closer

[Pre-Chorus]
Someone who's just a boy can't understand
But here's my chance to be a man for her

[Chorus]
It's your smile that brings me to tears
My hand feeling your kick now
You're my gift
I just wanna show you to the world
My miracle, my miracle, my miracle, oh, oh
My miracle, my miracle, my miracle, oh, oh
So amazing, my baby
My baby girl

[Verse 2]
I'm smarter now that I got a daughter
Not caught up, not worried 'bout the things that they say
'Cause I've learned just how to treat a woman
From her, there's a lot of things I didn't know
Like how beautiful you are when you sleeping
Girl, I'ma always be there when you need me
You're my lucky charm, I keep you far from harm
Baby, I won't let you go, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Someone who's just a boy can't understand (Woah)
But here's my chance to be a man for her, yeah

[Chorus]
It's your smile that brings me to tears (Oh)
My hand feeling your kick now (Kick now)

Don't you cry
And you know I'm gonna hug ya
And you know I'm gonna love ya

For eternity
Give all I give 'cause I
Man, you really mean that much to me
You are my baby girl
So I'ma take care of you
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh
(You're my baby)

[Chorus]
It's your smile that brings me to tears
My hand feeling your kick now
You're my gift

Rocking around the Christmas Tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Ev'ry couple tries to stop

You will get a sentimental feeling
When you hear voices singing
"Let's be jolly, Deck the halls with boughs of holly"

Rocking around the Christmas Tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In a new old fashioned way

Rocking around the Christmas Tree
Let the Christmas Spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

You will get a sentimental feeling
When you hear voices singing
"Let's be jolly, Deck the halls with boughs of holly"
Rocking around the Christmas Tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In a new old fashioned way

[Intro]
(Last night, all I think about is you)
(Don't stop, baby, you can walk through)
(Don't want, baby, think about you)
(You know that I'm never gonna lose)
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a—

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Verse 1]
Usually, I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today, I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Verse 2]
You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I say goodbye

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Bridge]
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Outro]
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror

[Verse 1]
As cold as an old ice cream sandwich, as focused as Mr. Miyagi
You poke at your phone posting aerial photos of you and your smoothie
I can't keep on making you happy 'cause you got issues with your daddy
I miss ramen noodles and laughing at you and your gran in home movies

[Pre-Chorus]
But I wish I could show you more of yourself
I wish I could make you somebody else
But I left it way too late
Are you stuck in your own ways?
(I'm begging)

[Chorus]
Hands, knees, please, tangerine, come on back to me
You got what I need, tangerine, do this for me
Hands, knees, please, tangerine, sugar, honey, sweet
Got what I need, tangerine

[Verse 2]
You let the devil in, and all you talk is money, money, money, money, money
It's so funny how it changes how you feel
How you see, how you need, how you sleep
All your freedom, caffeine, how you're looking at me
But I love it when the light sits on you just right
Tiny tangerine speckles painted in your eyes

[Chorus]
Hands, knees, please, tangerine, come on back to me
You got what I need, tangerine, do this for me
Hands, knees, please, tangerine, sugar, honey, sweet
Got what I need, tangerine

[Bridge]
(Oh my God)
(Drop the beat)

[Verse 3]
You've been dreamlessly sleepin' for years
Super clear since the late 1990s
You only look at me properly now
When you're drunk watching movies
Where are you? What happened? I want what we had
Where you gone? Where you hidin'?
It's 2:23, you got Friends on repeat, on repeat, on repeat, on repeat, on repeat, on re—

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I could show you more of yourself
I wish I could make you somebody else
But I left it way too late
Are you stuck in your own ways? (I'm begging)

[Bridge]
Hands, knees, please, tangerine, come on back to me
Got what I need, tangerine, do this for me
Hands, knees, please, tangerine, sugar, honey, sweet
Got what I need, tangerine
Hands, knees, please, tangerine, come on back to me
Got what I need, tangerine, do this for me
Hands, knees, please, tanger—
Tangerine

[Chorus]
(I'm beggin') Hands, knees, please, tangerine, come on back to me
You got what I need, tangerine, do this for me
Hands, knees, please, tangerine, sugar, honey, sweet
Got what I need, tangerine (Woah)

[Verse 1]
I said to you, "Why did you do it?"
Touch the glass, I'll feel ya through it
Against the wall with the bracelets on
You look bizarre in the apricot

[Chorus]
You think that you're Space Ghost
You're wanted coast to coast
Fuck that shit, now I go
My way and you go yours

[Verse 2]
Gotta be all that coco, ayy?
Playin' too much of that GTA
Playin' too much of that Dr. Dre
Doom, Quake, where'd you get the gun from, eh?
Really think that metal gonna make you safe?
Playing peek-a-boo with the devil these days
Black cap back with a trench coat, ayy
Living in the valley cuttin' porno tapes
(Living in the valley cuttin' porno)

[Chorus]
You think that you're Space Ghost
You're wanted coast to coast
Fuck that shit, now I go
My way and you go yours

[Verse 3]
Were you bored of gender norms?
Of being alone, no mama home
A bad divorce, or sad we can't
Afford the clothes our heroes own?
Remember when you stole
Mom's old Geo Metro
You wore her old bathrobe
Too small to see the road

[Bridge]
We were just two Texas toddlers
Pokémon and bottle rockets
Dunkaroos and Real Monsters
Capri Sun straw in the bottom

[Chorus]
You think that you're Space Ghost
You're wanted coast to coast
Fuck that shit, now I go
My way and you go yours

[Verse 4]
Heard you were lookin' up the cookbook, names
Cut into the back of your bedroom door frame
Supervillain with a manifesto, dang
Gotta say I'm pretty glad they caught you, man
Get back to the kickball days
Scared to hold hands at school disco days
007, Nintendo, James
Bond, Hot Pockets in the microwave

[Chorus]
You think that you're Space Ghost
You're wanted coast to coast
Fuck that shit, now I go
My way and you go yours

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
Oh, I’m headed to the mountains
I’ll be back in a week or two
Don’t you try to reach me 'cause I won’t pick up for you
I’ve got some things I need to do

[Interlude]
Hmmmm

[Verse 2]
Oh I’m headed to the mountains
Where the air is sweet and new
Don’t you try to reach me 'cause I don’t want to talk to you
I’ve got some thinking to do

[Chorus]
I’m trying to let go
I think it could help being alone
And I’m trying not to let you make me cry
I’ve spilled too many tears
And I think I deserve to be alone

[Bridge]
And don’t you try to reach me while I pick myself up and go
I’ve got to do this on my own
I need to build myself a home

[Interlude]
Ohhhhh

[Outro]
Oh, I’m headed to the mountains
The only place I feel at peace
And I knew you’d come after me so I threw away your keys
But I know you'd never go when I say leave
I’m headed to the mountains... don’t wait up for me

[Intro]
Why's it so much better when we're not together?
Why's it feel so good when it's a bad-bad idea?

[Verse 1]
Will you protect me from the things that I want?
Will you be down and leave the second we're done?
I got one thing I want, I know that it's wrong
But I like to play with fire

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll fuck you with no feelings left
Cruel intentions in my head
Hate it but I love the way I'm feelin' kinda reckless
I know that we had a past, I just want my power back
Hate it but I love the way I'm feelin' kinda senseless

[Chorus]
It's a bad idea
But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself
It's a bad idea
But I can't help myself, so I'll just help myself to you

[Post-Chorus]
Why's it so much better when we're not together?
Why's it-why's it feel so good when it's a bad-bad idea?

[Verse 2]
The taste of chaos on the tip of my tongue
I kinda like the crazy girl I've become
It's about time that I just have me some fun
'Cause I like to play with fire

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll fuck you with no feelings left
Cruel intentions in my head
Hate it but I love the way I'm feelin' kinda reckless
I know that we had a past, I just want my power back
Hate it but I love the way I'm feelin' kinda senseless

[Chorus]
It's a bad idea
But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself
It's a bad idea
But I can't help myself, so I'll just help myself to you
(I got a bad idea, ha)

[Post-Chorus]
Why's it so much better when we're not together?
Why's it-why's it feel so good when it's a bad-bad idea?

[Bridge]
(Ah)
(No, I can't help myself)
(Ah)
Ha
I don't know what makes me feel this way (Feel this way)
I don't care because I like it (I like it)
I don't know what makes me feel this way (Feel this way)
But I won't stop because I like it

[Chorus]
It's a bad idea
But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself
(I got a bad idea)
It's a bad idea (No, no, no)
But I can't help myself (Help myself), no, I can't help myself (Help myself)
It's a bad idea
But I can't help myself (Help myself), so I'll just help myself to you

[Post-Chorus]
Why's it so much better when we're not together?
Why's it feel so good when it's a bad-bad idea?
Why's it so much better when we're not together? (Not together)
Why's it feel so good when it's a bad-bad idea?
(I got a bad idea)

[Verse 1]
The more I love you, the more I rip you apart
That's what you said when we were arguing
I gave you so much love, I left none for myself
And you took it all away and threw it right back, right back

[Pre-Chorus]
You told me I'm a liar (Liar, liar)
You're acting like a fool
I'm allowed to hang out with my friends and without you
You're so in denial (Denial, denial)
And I'm so over you (You)
The more you push my buttons, boy, the more I see the truth

[Chorus]
You're so full of that jealousy
It's running crazy through your body
Jealousy
It makes you wanna hurt somebody
It's killing me
But I won't let it, baby, I won't let it
I wanna love you, but you're so full of that jealousy
You know it only makes you ugly
Jealousy
You won't let anybody touch me
It's killing me
But I won't let it, baby, I won't let it
I wanna love you, but you're so full of that jealousy

[Verse 2]
It's you and your ego that's fighting for the crown
Maybe that is just your insecurity
I gave you attention, left nothing for myself
And you threw it all away, and I said "Fuck that" (Fuck that)
Fuck that

[Pre-Chorus]
You told me I'm a liar (Liar, liar)
You're acting like a fool
The more you push my buttons, boy, the more I see the truth

[Chorus]
You're so full of that jealousy
It's running crazy through your body
Jealousy
It makes you wanna hurt somebody
It's killing me
But I won't let it, baby, I won't let it
I wanna love you, but you're so full of that jealousy
You know it only makes you ugly
Jealousy
You won't let anybody touch me
It's killing me
But I won't let it, baby, I won't let it
I wanna love you, but you're being jealous

[Bridge]
Huh, turn it louder
Jealous, so jealous
You so jealous
Owww!

[Chorus]
You're so full of that jealousy
It's running crazy through your body
Jealousy
It makes you wanna hurt somebody
It's killing me
But I won't let it, baby, I won't let it
I wanna love you, but you're so full of that jealousy
You know it only makes you ugly
Jealousy
You won't let anybody touch me
It's killing me
But I won't let it, baby, I won't let it
I wanna love you, but you're so full of that jealousy
It's runnin' crazy through your body
Jealousy
It makes you wanna hurt somebody
It's killing me
But I won't let it, baby, I won't let it
I wanna love you, but you're so full of that jealousy
You know it only makes you ugly
Jealousy
You won't let anybody touch me
It's killing me
But I won't let it, baby, I won't let it
I wanna love you, but you're so full of that jealousy
Yeah, it's
Kick it

Yeah, it’s
Kick it

You want to know why?
Because I'm...

[Repeat and fade the following]
Ho...
Check it
Brooklyn
Hold it now, hit it
Yo, Leroy!
Ahh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Why don't you hook up that def jam right about now?

Now I chill real ill when I start to chill
When I fill my pockets with a knot of dollar bills
Sipping pints of ale out the window sill
When I get my fill I'm chilly-chill
And now, I just got home because I'm out on bail
What's the time? It's time to buy ale
Peter eater, parking meter, all of the time
If I run out of ale, it's Thunderbird wine
Miller drinking, chicken eating, dress so sly
I got friends in high places that are keeping me high
Get down with Mike D and it ain't no hassle
I got the ladies of the eighties from here to White Castle

Hold it now, hit it
Yo, Leroy!
It's my drum, it's my, hold it now, it's my rhyme
MC Adam Yauch, in the place to be
All the girls are on me 'cause I'm down with Mike D
I'm down with Mike D, and it ain't no baloney
For real, not phony, O.E. and Rice-a-Roni
I come out at night 'cause I sleep all day
Well, I'm the King Ad-Rock and he's MCA
Well, I'm cruisin', I'm bruisin', I'm never ever losing
I'm in my car, I'm going far, and dust is what I'm using
Around the way is where I'm from
And I'm from Manhattan, and I'm not a bum
Because you're pud-slapping, ball-flapping, got that juice
My name's Mike D and I can do that Jerry Lewis

Hold it now, hit it
Yo, Leroy!
Yo, that was real def man, try that again, man
I like that def stuff, boy

Hip-hoppin', body rockin', doin' the do
Beer drinking, breath stinking, sniffing glue
Belly fillin', always illin', bustin' caps
My name's Mike D, and I write my own snaps
I'm a peep-show seeking on the Forty-Deuce
I'm a killer at large, and I'm on the loose
Pistol packing, Monkey drinking, no money bum
I come from Brooklyn 'cause that's where I'm from
Cheap-skatin', perpetrating, money-hungry jerk
Every day I drink O.E., and I don't go to work
You drippy nose knucklehead, you're wet behind the ears
You like men and we like beer
Hold it now, hit it
Yo, Leroy!
Bust that choco-lotto
What, huh, yo, man, pass that over here, man, all right

King of the Ave with the Def female
You're rhymin' and stealin' with the freshest ale
Kid cooling at the crib watching my TV
Ed Norton - Ted Knight - and Mr. E-D
Pump it up, homeboy, just don't stop
Chef Boyardee, cooling on the pot
I take no slack, 'cause I got the knack
I'm never dusting out 'cause I tossed that crack
The King Ad-Rock — that is my name
Y'all drinking Moet, and we got the champagne
A quarter droppin', going shoppin', buyin' wigs
Surgeon general, cut professor, DJ Thigs

Hold it now, hit it
Hit it
Hit it
Yo, Leroy!

[Intro]
No, no, no, no, no-no
Ooh

Ooh

[Verse 1]
Light a blunt up with the flame
Put that cocaine on a plate
Molly with the purple rain
'Cause I lost my faith
So I cut away the pain, uh
Got it swimming in my veins
Now my mind is outta place, yeah, uh
'Cause I lost my faith

[Chorus]
And I feel everything
I feel everything from my body to my soul
No, no
Well, I feel everything
When I'm coming down is the most I feel alone
No, no

[Post-Chorus]
I've been sober for a year, now it's time for me
To go back to my old ways, don't you cry for me
Thought I'd be a better man, but I lied to me and to you

[Verse 2]
I take half a Xan' and I still stay awake
All my demons wanna pull me to my grave
I choose Vegas if they offer Heaven's gate
I tried to love, but you know I'd never stay
I'd never stay
But if I OD, I want you to OD right beside me
I want you to follow right behind me
I want you to hold me while I'm smilin'
While I'm dyin'
And if you know me
When I go missing, you know where to find me
Driving down the boulevard is blindin'
Always blinded by the desert lights and
I'm alive when

[Chorus]
I feel everything
I feel everything from my body to my soul
No, no
Girl, I feel everything
When I'm coming down is the most I feel alone
No, no

[Bridge]
I lost my faith
I'm losing my religion every day
Time hasn't been kind to me, I pray
When I look inside the mirror and see someone I love
Oh, someone I love
Faith
I'm losing my religion every day
Time hasn't been kind to me, I pray
When I look inside the mirror and see someone I love
Oh, someone I love

[Outro]
I ended up in the back of a flashing car
With the city shining on my face
The lights are blinding me again
I ended up in the back of a flashing car
With the city shining on my face
The lights are blinding me again
I ended up (I ended up), in the back of a flashing car (Back of a flashing car)
I can't tell you anything you don't already know
I keep on trying, I should just let it go
I keep on singing, you're eyes they just roll
It sounds like someone else's song from along time ago

You already know the story and the chords are just the same
You already know I love you, and I sound like whats-his-name
But you can't stop me, I want you to know
I know it sounds like someone else's song from along time ago
I wanna be your kingpin, living in Pekin
I wanna be your bigwig, living in Pekin
I caught the flu and away I flew
N.Y.C., pediate blue

Dimeatap, and spinal tap, a-city maps, and hand claps
Statue of liberty play, it only works once, don't throw it away
'Cause I wanna be your kingpin, living in Pekin
Living in Pekin, livin in....

How can I, how can I give my love to you when I don't know what to do
I got you and it's all I need
I got you and it's all I need
I got you and it's all I need
I got you
I got you and I still believe
That you're all that I'll ever need
It's you

All
All the way back in the seventies
You were my little t.v. queen
Y'er tarzan and friend Janine
I got you
I got you and I still believe
That you're all that I'll ever need
It's you

All
It's the end of the century
I can't think of anything
Except you
It's the end of the century
And I can't think of anything
But you, all, all, I, need
I got you
I got you, babe
I got you
I got you
I got you
I got you

[Verse 1]
Take me out to Chinatown
Come on, let's run these streets in the rain
I want a sugar push, got your candy hooked
I need your bullets back in my brain

[Pre-Chorus]
I can be your girl
If you need to go
I just wanna blow
Swing me around, pull me into the flames

[Chorus]
Bloodshot eyes, I think I'm on my way
I'm so high
You gotta one, two, bamboo, do it again

[Hook]
Kick off, throw it away
You gotta one, two, bamboo, do it again
Kick off, throw it away
You gotta one, two, bamboo, do it again

[Verse 2]
Lost in lanterns in the sky
Hundreds of sparkles caught in my brain
Oh man, you move so blue, but you look real cool
Oh, don't you know I'm ready to break?

[Pre-Chorus]
I can be your girl
If you need to go
I just wanna blow
Swing me around, pull me into the flames

[Chorus]
Bloodshot eyes, I think I'm on my way
I'm so high

Kick off, throw it away
You gotta one, two, bamboo, do it again
Kick off, throw it away
You gotta one, two, bamboo, do it again

[Intro]
Oh, yeah
Ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
Shots of tequila, bottles of Patron
Blunts to the face, you don't wanna sing no more
Lost your C notes
Cabbed all day, took the bus back home
Eviction on your door
Blame it on the booze, blame it on the juice
Blame it on the night lights, life passin' you
Just don't blame it on me, girl
Don't you blame it on me
'Cause I get it, you're built like a Goddess
And you 

[?]
'Specially when your nose red
From that K, special Diet Coke
You a coke head and you got no rent
You blow that money, money
You try to window shop, you blow another hundred
Fuckin' goons in the day, hipster nights downtown
Wanna-be lifestyle, oh, why?

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah you thought you could be baby, oh yeah
I got the whole crew in here, baby (Baby)
Ahh, you know what you see when you're laid there (Ooh)
Girl, you are what you be (Ooh)

Girl, take your nose off my keyboard
What you botherin' me for?
There's a room full of niggas
What you followin' me for?
This ain't a fuckin' sing-along
So, girl, what you singin' for?
It's cause we blowin' like a C4
You know my whole crew blowin' like a C4
20, get the bar rollin'
Fake IDs in the trash, we throwin'
Straight to the top, rooftop clubs
With a hand full of girls and they all so foreign
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowin'
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta cash, first flight from Poland

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, you thought you could be baby, oh yeah
I got the whole crew in here, baby

[Verse 3]
Nights pass so much quicker than the days did
Same clothes, you ain't ready for your day shift
But you up, you need money for ya' face lift
Lust over love is ya' mindset
Waken up with most of ya' side wet
Other room, you hear your mom cryin'
'Cause she found your coke stuffed in the laundry
And the Bacardi from the last party

[Bridge]
Just don't blame it on me, girl
Don't you blame it on me, girl
Don't you blame it on me
Don't you blame it on me
Don't you blame it on me, girl

Ooh, ooh
Guess it's all just a second away

[Verse 1]
Give me a second of your time
'Cause I got something on my mind
And I know you don't want to hear it
Take your hands 

[?]
If you're listening to me
The white lies, the stories
Just make it true this time
Ooh, just a second away
And I think about it night and day
We could make a change in our lives
Ooh, why you throw it away
We could make it right today
We could make a change in our lives

[Chorus]
Miracles around the corner
I know a change is coming for ya
And it's all just a second away
See it over the horizon
Leave it to

Oh, just a second away
And I think about it night and day
We could make a change in our lives
Oh, just a second away
And I think about it night and day
Only a second away
Oh, oh
Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse]
The days are getting shorter, I noticed
Seems like time is movin' fast forward while I'm in slow motion
Losing loved ones with really no one to cope with
It's cool, my third and my fourth eye open
Man, I dodged the cell but still locked on my cell
I never thought I'd see the day my mom wouldn't agree with Oprah and Gayle
Myra 

[?] was my peace and Heaven on Earth and living Hell
Who gave me everything but never took anything for herself
Imagine '06 Impala with zero mileage
Seventeen, baggy clothes, not like Billie Eilish
Some niggas grow up and not old, they still as childish
Demons wearin' masks as my friends, they favorite disguises
But niggas not gon' forget about me like niggas forgot 'bout how Harriet was supposed to be on top of that twenty dollars
Dog, my life was seen out of Casa Blanca
You got it wrong, I'm the monster
Burning Man, ayahuasca
My check got no diagnostics
You disappear in the D like you Jimmy Hoffa
I-, yeah

[Chorus]
There was never, ever reason for my actions please forgive me
There was never, ever reason for my actions please forgive me
There was never, ever reason for my actions please forgive me

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
There was never, ever reason for my actions please forgive me
There was never, ever reason for my actions please forgive me
There was never, ever reason for my actions please forgive me

I’ve always wondered why people say we shouldn't stare at this powerful source of energy. Made me curious.

[Yara Shahidi]
What if you go blind?

[Baby Keem]
I've never heard of anyone goin’ blind from starin' at the Sun.

[Yara Shahidi]
Guess you got a point there. Have you seen anything yet?

[Baby Keem]
Many things.

[Yara Shahidi]
Like what?

[Baby Keem]
See for yourself. You should turn off the phone.

Welcome to the present.

[Verse: Baby Keem & Kendrick Lamar]
Two trench coats in the bag
Baby Keem, king of rap
And I think he just came back
How the fuck did I go back? (pgLang)
Get your case off my back (pgLang)

Beat my son, go to your room (pgLang, pgLang)
Stop sneak-dissin', that ain't bool

[Part III]

[Spoken Word: Unknown & Baby Keem]
As we grow up, we begin to identify with things (Bitch). Which means, identify means, we divide all sense of who we are from certain things. When you're identified with something that you are not, it always leads to suffering and unhappiness.

Your face is tellin' me, everything that you don't say
Yeah, I can't seem to figure this out
Round and round we go-o, on this never endin' road-o
Sometimes I feel I'm stuck in this cloud
But you won't keep me down

Shit that had me down, same shit I laugh about
What go around always come back around baby
I turn my life around, that's a one-eighty
Don't give a fuck, I just been havin' fun lately
Went a little crazy, lost my mind
My homies had to come and get me

From mountains high to valleys low, they speak the name of Jaimie-O
Who with his pa, went searching for that gold in old California
By riverboat and wagon train, old Doc McPheeters crossed the plains
And told his son, keep moving on there's gold in old California
Go westward ho, young Jaimie-O and you'll find fortune and fame

And to this day when tales are told of pioneers a thousand fold
McPheeters' name still shines like gold from Maine to old California
Go westward ho, young Jaimie-O, and you'll find fortune and fame
And to this day when tales are told of pioneers a thousand fold
McPheeters' name still shines like gold from Maine to old California
From Maine to old California

Hey, I finally get it

"Come here, baby" kisses are my favorite kind
Don't forget to call when you wake up
A little extra sugar in my coffee cup
I don't wanna love you, but I do
Baby, there’s just something about you
My mind screaming something, my heart just can't do
I don't wanna love you, but I do

Yeah, I don’t wanna feel this, but I am
I wish I could say I didn't give a damn
I'd love to shut their feelings down, it fell out of hand
I don't wanna feel this by 

[hand?]

I can't believe I hung around long enough for love to get a hold
I've always been the kind, to always know the perfect time to go

I don't wanna leave you, but I will
Though I know it's gonna hurt like hell
Lord knows I know better than doing this to myself
I don’t wanna leave you, but I will

I don’t wanna love you, but I do
Baby, there's just something about you
My mind screaming something, my heart just can’t do
I don't wanna love you, but I do
And my heart is saying one thing, but my mind knows the truth
I don't wanna love you, but I do
I don't wanna love you, but I do

Why you so uptight, what’s the problem?
Everybody knows you're doing it anyway
Why you act so tight when you got so much?
You could be sending it my way
Those guys were cool, but you'll never give yourself away
And I’m not a fool, no, “I love you” I said

He had all his guns and all his guns were blazing
Put his arms around me, so amazing

I don’t start fights but I’ll stop 'em all by my any means
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

[Verse 2]
Why you so upset, what’s the problem?
Everybody knows you’re doing it anyway
Why you act so tough when you got so much?
Going for you already
Those guys were cool, but you never gave yourself away
Baby it's true, you I’d never betray

[Pre-Chorus]
He had all his guns and all his guns were blazing
Put his arms around me, so amazing
He had all his guns, all his guns were blazing
Put his arms around me, so amazing
Amazing, amazing, amazing

He'd call me the serene queen

You think too much, you dream too much
You think too much, you dream too much
You think too much, you dream too much
But what a beautiful mind is such

He had all his guns and all his guns were blazing
He never gave himself away
He had all his guns and all his guns were blazing
I’d never betray

(Come on baby, if you want it you can get it right)
The serene queen
(Come on baby, if you want it you can get it right now)
I don’t start fights but I’ll stop 'em all by my any means
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

[Verse 1]
Hey, over there
Please forgive me if I'm coming on too strong
Hate to stare, but you're winning
And they're playing my favorite song
So come here, a little closer
Wanna whisper in your ear
Make it clear, a little question
Wanna know just how you feel

[Chorus]
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?
'Cause you feel like paradise, and I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?

[Verse 2]
Hey, you might think that I'm crazy
But you know I'm just your type
I might be a little hazy
But you just cannot deny
There's a spark in-between us
When we're dancing on the floor
I want more, wanna see it
So, I'm asking you tonight

[Chorus]
If I said my heart was beating loud
If we could escape the crowd somehow
If I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?
'Cause you feel like paradise, and I need a vacation tonight
So, if I said I want your body now, would you hold it against me?

[Spoken Interlude]
If I said I want your body, would you hold it against me?

[Bridge]
Give me something good
Don't wanna wait, I want it now
Drop it, like a hood
And show me how you work it out
Alright

Keeping my love and my head alright
I try to feel something real and alive
I know that we can’t stay and talk all night
But I'd like to try

So turn out the light
I’ll try again in the morning
I’ll wake up and feel okay
I could ignore all the warnings

I forget what we said when we talked
And I wish I could remember it all
Because I’m having these crazy thoughts
(Am I in love or just afraid to be alone?)
Talk to me now you’re gone
I can’t escape from this all alone
But you won’t pick up your phone
(All this love is it a waste of our time, no)
Oh I’ve been trying
You know that I’ve been trying
You know I've been trying
Been trying

So turn out the light
I’ll try again in the morning time
In the morning light
It’ll feel alright in the morning time

Hey pretty girl put that record on
And I'll kiss you in the back of the parking lot
Hey pretty girl put that record on
There's a lady in the back listening for your song

That girl thinks that you're an angel
She'd pour you in her glass of wine
Thirsty for the truth
She'd stain her lips with you
And the best thing you could do
The best thing you could do would be to love, love, love, love

Hey pretty girl put that record on
And I'll kiss you in the back of the parking lot
Hey pretty girl put that record on
There's a lady in the back listening for your song

[Verse 1]
Let me take you home and let me show you around
I need a little love tonight
We sleep until the sun comes up and go for a ride
You leave me for a second to hide

[Chorus 1]
And they were catcalling and howling
And no my name's not honey or love
I wasn't looking for a fight
And no, I don't need that kind of man in my life

[Verse 2]
I wanna feel your love but I don't need them to cry
Just leave all other thoughts behind
You're warm like the sun and it makes me want to die
Don't try and live without sunlight

[Chorus 2]
And they were catcalling and howling
And no my name's not honey or love
I wasn't looking for a fight
And no, I don't need that kind of man in my life

[Bridge]
Need a little love, need a little love
Need a little love tonight
Need a little love, need a little love
Need a little love tonight

Need a little love, need a little love
Need a little love tonight
Need a little love, need a little love
Need a little love tonight

I need a little love, I need a little love
I need a little love tonight
Need a little love, need a little love
I need a little love tonight

[Chorus 3]
And they were catcalling and howling
And no my name's not honey or love
I wasn't looking for a fight
And no, I don't need that kind of man in my life

They were catcalling and howling
And no my name's not honey or love
I wasn't looking for a fight
And no, I don't need that kind of man in my life
No, I don't need that kind of man in my life
You came in and shot me with silk on your chest
Beating on my velvet drum
You think I don’t know how to speak in your tongue
I was a baby before you were born

Learn how to breathe
How to breathe, how to breathe

Hey!

How to breathe, how to breathe

We’re all made of star stuff
We’re all made of moon blood
We’re all made of star stuff
We’re all made of moon blood
I'm lost in your brown eyed blues
Playing with a burnt out fuse
A fire won't start without a spark my love

You're crawling up my spine
A ghost of what was mine
You gathered all my mismatched socks
You said your shoes had had enough

You're rusting round the edges
Copper twisting through your kisses
I pretend that you're brand new

Clouds around your eyes
I'm pouring out goodbyes
You sat on the table with my stuff
And went through everything we ever loved

Flowers grew out of my spine
While we were dancing side by side
But you said it's time to say goodnight

[Intro]
Okay
(Mustard on the beat, ho)

[Chorus]
Don't give me no bammer weed
We don't smoke that shit, it's TGOD
Don't give me no bammer weed
We don't smoke that shit, it's TGOD
Don't give me no bammer weed
We don't smoke that shit, it's TGOD
Don't give me no bammer weed
We don't smoke that shit, it's TGOD (Okay)

[Verse 1]
Ridin', slidin', dippin', vibin'
Bitch, get high, come and live this life
I'm a rich nigga, I could fuck a rich bitch twice
I'm a rich nigga, I could fuck a rich nigga wife
Make her roll this joint when she get inside
You be home on your own, but your friends ain't shy
Bustdown Rollie, make my wrist hit bright
You gon' hit this J, you gon' get this pipe
Hit it 'til the mornin', I'ma miss this flight
Good daytime, you a freak at night
Hoes get mad, better keep that bite
When you live like me, you don't see that price
Want that bag, don't need likes
OG swag, don't need stripes
Only gas, that's only right
Smokin' tree my only vice

[Chorus]
Don't give me no bammer weed (Okay)
We don't smoke that shit, it's TGOD
Don't give me no bammer weed
We don't smoke that shit, it's TGOD
Don't give me no bammer weed
We don't smoke that shit, it's TGOD
Don't give me no bammer weed
We don't smoke that shit, it's TGOD

[Verse 2]
Don't give me no bammer joint
If it's in my bag, know the grass on point
Only real ones roll big doinks
Kinda into her friend, if she want, she can join
Rolled up when she heard my voice
She comin' with me, she ain't got no choice
Six D'USSÉ, no Rolls-Royce
Just bought a Corvette, just sold my Porsche
Only hit one time, she callin'
No NBA team, we ballin'
Don't take 'em on trips, don't spoil 'em
New that, new this, need all 'em
New whip, new paint like Rodman
No brake, straight gas, you stallin'
Don't take no breaks, I'm dialed in
See me, big smoke like fireman

[Chorus]
Don't give me no bammer weed
We don't smoke that shit, it's TGOD
Don't give me no bammer weed
We don't smoke that shit, it's TGOD
Don't give me no bammer weed
We don't smoke that shit, it's TGOD
Don't give me no bammer weed
We don't smoke that shit, it's TGOD

[Intro]
It's like whatever I do (Oh)
Just can't get through to you (Oh, oh)
I'm never gonna tell anything wrong (Oh, oh)
Listen (Oh)

[Verse 1]
Now, now she loved me, shawty I loved her
Used to jump up in the Maybach and roll out
Used to care, she used to share
The love that she used to give me can't be found
I lost my way, she said she'd stay
And lately I've been sleeping with a ghost
My stock is down and out, I used to be worth my weight in gold
That was before the Great Depression kicked in and rocked us (Rocked us)
And that was before the hurricane came in and stopped us
I told you to leave, but you lied to me when you said that
"Baby, no worries, I promise to get us back"

[Chorus]
I know sorry just wouldn't do it
Her heart is obliterated, I'm trying to travel through
But it's like moving mountains
It's like moving mountains, hey
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change
And the sky turns gray, and the water from the rain washes progress away
It's like moving mountains (Moving mountains)
It's like moving mountains (Moving mountains)

[Post-Chorus]
Why you just leave me?
Just leave me be
Just leave me
Just leave me be
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be, oh, oh (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Be, oh oh, oh oh (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh

[Verse 2]
She don't touch me, I don't touch her
We rarely even ever say a word
I really want to give her everything she deserves
But the bad took away the good
She thinks that I'm full of it, arguments
Always pissed, man, I'm tired
Every kiss that I miss, girl you know I'm trying
You never believe when I say
And I never believe it when you say "I love you"
And I shouldn't complain about it
I should take it like a man and walk up out it
'Cause we will never be the same, oh
I've been standing in gas and you have been the flame

[Chorus]
I know sorry just wouldn't do it
Her heart is obliterated, I'm trying to get through
Gotta move a mountain, yeah
It's like moving mountains, hey
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change
And the sky turns gray, and the water from the rain washes progress away
It's like moving mountains (Moving mountains)
It's like moving mountains (Moving mountains)

[Post-Chorus]
Well, baby, why you just leave me?
Just leave me be
Just leave me
Just leave me be
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be
Why you just leave me
Just leave me be, oh oh

[Bridge]
This must be a slow death that I'm traveling on
It feels so wrong, I'm barely holdin' on
See, no matter what it takes, I've gotta get it together, baby, yeah
And these hills that I'm travelin' up
She ain't showing me love
I'm down on my love
Ooh, I'm down
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
I know sorry just wouldn't do it
Her heart is obliterated, I'm trying to travel through
But it's like moving mountains, hey
It's like moving mountains, hey (Moving a mountain, hey)
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change
And the sky turns gray, and the water from the rain washes progress away
It's like moving a mountain (I'm trying to move)
Baby, trying to move this mountain

[Outro]
Well, baby, why you just leave me? (Leave me)
Just leave me be (Leave me)
Just leave me (Leave me)
Just leave me be (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Why you just leave me (Leave me)
Just leave me be (Won't you leave me be)
Why you just leave me (Oh oh, oh)
Just leave me be, oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, baby, baby
Oh oh oh oh, yeah

But she still gon' give it up
Yo, scream!

[Chorus]
My way (My way), my way (Ah yeah, yeah)
You can't satisfy her needs (You can't)
She keeps running back to see me do it (She keeps running back to me, yeah)
My way (Oh), my way (Oh)
What I say, goes (What I say, goes)
And I'm in control (Shake it out)

[Verse 2]
Badass, señoritas, two-seaters with kicks
New kicks, all in the mix
I don't turn no tricks, they turn for me
Catching bricks don't concern me
So forget it, little midget
My mind on seven digits
Before I pay Heaven skies a visit, now dig it
I'm pulling all stops, locking down all spots
Saying "You, can't, front"
So, from this day forth, you know I'm all about heat
And what I do be the Major League
That's why your girlfriend's paging me
And she know like he know
You don't see her like I see her, so she's out the door
Shotgun in my drop, having fun
With the Don, system bassing, conversation
About how she been chasing me
And facing me, saying, "Give it to me"
Now scream!

[Chorus]
My way (Oh, my way), my way (Ah yeah, yeah, yeah)
You can't satisfy her needs (You can't)
She keeps running back to see me do it (She keeps running back to me, yeah)
My way (Oh), my way (Oh)
What I say, goes (What I say, goes)
And I'm in control

[Verse 3]
Don't check me (Check me)
It was your girl who let me (Let me)
Take it this far, then, ooh wee! (Ooh wee)
Let her have it every chance that she could get
What, you think you a baller?
I ain't gon' call her, clip that
You can get mad if you want to, say whatever you want
But she still gon' give it up
Say it with me, c'mon!

[Chorus]
My way (My way), my way (Ah yeah, yeah)
You can't satisfy her needs (You can't)
She keeps running back to see me do it (She keeps running back to me, yeah)
My way (Oh), my way (Oh)
What I say, goes (What I say, goes)
And I'm in control

[Intro]
I'ma take y'all back

And it goes a little something like this, yeah, uh
Yeah, yeah

Check me out

[Chorus]
All the time I think of you (Think of you)

Baby, I can't take no more (I can't take no more, girl)

After all the wrong you've done to me
I can't go on feeling like I do
'Cause my heart loves you
Yo, sing!

[Chorus]
All the time I think of you (Think of you)
Holding on to someone new (Someone new)
Don't make me lose my mind (No-no, no-no, baby)

Yo, what y'all wanna do?
What y'all wanna do?
Yo, yo, yo
Really, what y'all wanna do?

[Verse 1]
See, around here, we're just too much
We could slow down and you still couldn't catch us
My town full of heavy-hitters, bread-getters
Real fly, unforgettable-type fellas
See, all I do is keep hitting them up
Getting them up, shaking your butt, nigga, what
Lil' Liberaci, can't nobody stop me
Always making moves, so you better watch me
Slide to the southside in my blue drop-top, 355
Keeping it live
When you wanna make them (Jump-jump), you know what to do
Call me and my crew to the rescue
De-de-de-de-de
Captain So So Def
We rocks the party 'til there's no one left (For sure)
Turn your volume up a notch
And watch the ba-bomb, bump-bump-bump, speakers pop
You never missed your water 'til your well runs dry
I never missed my woman till she said goodbye
Now my heart's made a change
My whole world's rearrange
And I'm ready to give you what you deserved
(Baby, baby, baby, please)
Yo, scream!

[Chorus]
Come back, come back
Lover, this is where you belong (Belong, belong)
In my arms, in my world (Belong, belong, belong)
Come back, come back
Lover, this is where you belong (Belong, belong)
In my life, as my girl (Belong, belong, belong)

[Verse 2]
The grass is greener on the other side
We take people for granted 'til they're out of sight
I don't think that you know how much I'm going through
I don't think that you know how much I really love you, yeah

[Outro]
All I do, is think of you
See, I can't eat, can't sleep, baby it ain't hard to see all I do
All I do (Ah, yeah), is think of you
And you bump, diggy bump, bump, bump
Diggy, diggy, bump, bump, baby
Come back

[Intro]
Just like me, just like me
Just like me, just like me
Yo, uh, what, what
You got it going on
What, what
Lemme hear you say, "Yeah"
"Yeah!"
Say, "Yeah"
"Yeah!"
Yo, say, "I came to par-tay"
"I came to par-tay"
Yo, say, "We came to par-tay"
"We came to par-tay"
All the ladies say, "Just like me"
"Just like me"
"Just like me"
"Just like me"
"Just like me"
"Just like me"
Say, "Just like me"
"Just like me"
All my homeboys say, "Just like me"
"Just like me"
"Just like me"
"Just like me"
Say, "Just like me"
"Just like me"
Now everybody say, "Just like me"
"Just like me"

[Verse 1]
You're the kind of girl that makes
Everybody feel that you're just so damn good
(So damn good)
But your secrets, I've found out
So don't deny what you're about
I know the truth
You know I do, I do 'cause

[Chorus]
I know you get lonely (Just like me)
And you want it (Just like me)
But act like you don't
When you know you're just like me
I know you get lonely (Just like me)
And you want it (Just like me)
But act like you don't
When you know you're just like me

[Verse 2]
Quiet is kept you cry for help
When no one else is there, I know you're touching yourself
I know it feel good
Late night calls, I bet you do it all
Anything to get it off
But you still persist to front on me
Baby, tell me

[Bridge]
Why do we play this game of chase (Ah yeah, yeah)
When we know we both feel the same way? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And why do you put me through all these changes (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
When you know you're just a freak like me?

[Outro]
Just like me, just like me
Just like me, just like me

[Intro]
Are y'all ready?
One, two, three, drop it
Oh, o-ooh
Oh, o-ooh
Oh, o-ooh
Oh, o-ooh
Say, "Yeah"

Yah-yah, say, "Yeah"
"Yeah!"
Lemme hear you say, "Yeah"
"Yeah!"
Yah-yah, say, "Yeah"
"Yeah!"
Ah, ow
Oh yes, ha
Check it out, it's me again, huh
The crazy one, ha
Yo

[Verse]
I can't sleep at night, I toss and turn
Listening for the telephone
When I get your call, I'm all choked up
Can't believe you called my home
And as a matter of fact, it blows my mind
You would even talk to me
Because a girl like you is like a dream come true
A real life fantasy

[Pre-Chorus]
No matter what your friends try to tell you
We were made to fall in love
And we will be together, any kind of weather
It's like that, sing it

[Chorus]
Every little step I take, you will be there
Every little step I make (Yeah), we'll be together
Every little step I take (Already), you will be there (Lemme say you say)
Every little step I make (Lemme y'all remember this), we'll be together
Every little—
Every little step I (Every little step)
Every little—
Every little step I make (Oh, oh)
Every little— (Aw yeah)
Every little step (Every little step)
Every little—

[Verse 1]
Now that you are here with me
Baby, let's do it right
Lady, you know just what I need
I want to hold you oh so tight
Baby, just touch me anywhere
Cutie, you turn me on, ooh baby
I'd like to run my fingers through your hair
So come on and stay with me all night

[Chorus]
I wanna rock wit'cha, baby
All night long
I wanna roll wit'cha, lady
Feeling's so strong
I wanna rock wit'cha, baby
All night long
Rock and roll and roll and rock
Makin' sweet love, don't you ever stop

[Intro]
"You're about to witness something you've never witnessed before"

[Chorus]
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with it
You make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Sing)
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do (Come on)
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with it
You make me
You make me

[Verse 1]
Before anything came between us
You were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to
When me and my girl was having problems
She used to say it'll be okay
Suggest little nice things that I should do
And when I go home at night and lay my head down
All I seemed to think about was you
I can't hear you, sing

[Chorus]
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with it
You make me (Sing)
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with it
You make me
You make me

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Now what's bad
Is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowing it should've been you
What's sad is I love her but I'm falling for you
Tell me what should I do?
Should I one
Or should I two
'Cause I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together

[Chorus]
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Ooh baby)
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do (Say what you do)
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with it
You make me (You make me, yeah)
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Oh baby)
Start a new relationship with you
This is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with it
You make me
You make me

[Bridge]
At this point
The situation's out of control, baby
I never meant to hurt her but I, what?
(Gotta let her go)
And if she may not understand it
Why all of this is going on
I can't hear you, I...and I...
(You make me wanna)
(You make me wanna)

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Chattanooga, say "Yeah" (Yeah)
Say "Yeah" (Yeah)

Say "Yeah" (Yeah)
One, two, three, drop
Say "Yeah" (Yeah)
Say "Yeah, yeah, yeah" (Yeah)
Say "Yeah, yeah, yeah" (Yeah)
Say "Yeah" (Yeah)
Yo, Chattanooga, y'all give it up for my band
Y'all give it up for my dancers
Ayo, Chattanooga, how about y'all homeboys?
I love you, Chattanooga, and I mean that
Good night

[Intro: Usher]
If you live for something
You're not alone, my friend
So fill up your cup and lift your lighter
A toast to life

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Luda
They say what don't kill me
Can make me stronger
So two drinks a night
Should help me live longer
I blow some smoke
Just to give my lungs a test
'Cause why tip-toe through life
To arrive safely at death
I'm on a journey
Yeah, I'm on a roll
Sometimes gotta close my eyes
Just to open my soul
And tonight is the night
I got a feeling that I'm about to act a fool
So if you go fix some drinks
Me and Usher are about to break some rules

[Chorus: Usher]
That's somewhere to go
But the world is moving slow
I was born for the fast life
I go for broke
A lesson I can't afford
But for what it's worth I'm ready to pay
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
Oh, oh

If I got one life to live
I'ma party 'til I'm dead
What the hell is a life worth living
If it's not on the edge
Tryna keep my balance, I'm twisted
So just in case I fall
Written on my tombstone should say
"Women, weed, and alcohol"

[Chorus: Usher]
That's somewhere to go
But the world is moving slow
I was born for the fast life
I go for broke
A lesson I can't afford
But for what it's worth I'm ready to pay
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life

Tell my baby bye-bye
Should I
Do exactly what I feel inside
'Cause I
I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together

Why all of this is going on
I tried, I tried to fight it
But the feeling's just too strong
You make, make, make me (You make me wanna)

[Verse 1: Jermaine Dupri]
You saw me and the U
In a drop-top Benz, baby, what would you do?
Say it all depends — no, it don't
What you want, that's all it's about
You could say "What's up?" and keep steppin'
Or cut and turn us both out
See, all I'm tryna do is make you party right
Non-stop tricks by the flock, Cubans with the rocks
Superior yachts, the spot that stay hot (Hot)
To hell with your block, I got the radio on lock, what

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel like somebody's watching me
They prolly talkin' 'bout me right now as we speak
I used to be ballin' in these streets
But now I'm just so discrete they wonder what was wrong with me
Huh, nothin' at all, I found love
There's only one girl I dream of
My boys laugh at me, talkin' I'm caught up
I tell 'em, "Y'all keep dribblin'
I'll be huggin' and kissin' my baby"

[Chorus]
Out of love
(It's out of love)
Why I do the things I do, woah
Why I act the way I do
Every time it comes to you
All out of love
(It's out of love)
Yes, it is
So I take it to the heart
I really do
Why do I act the way I do?
Out of love I have for you

[Verse 2]
Why the words from the heart
Are diamond rings, for sure
I want you to understand
I don't need a pat on my back
It's out of love for you, baby
And that's for sure
As a dude, I can fall in love that still be tough
Huh, and still roll with the fellas, 'cause that's wassup (That's wassup)
Talkin' at me, talkin' I'm caught up
I told 'em, "Y'all need to listen
'Cause I'll be huggin' and kissin' my baby"

[Chorus]
Out of love
(It's out of love)
Why I do the things I do, oh yeah
Why I act the way I do (I act)
Every time it comes to you
It's out of love
Yes, it is, baby
(It's out of love)
Oh
So I take it to the heart
I really do
Why do I act the way I do? (Why)
Out of love I have for you (Listen)

[Bridge]
I have learned to love and appreciate
The beauty of a queen
Now I just want you to understand
That I'm the only king in the world for you, baby
Say it with me, baby
Huh, think y'all know what I'm talkin' 'bout
It's all about love, love, love
It's all about love
You, girl

[Intro]
Man, I get lazy when I see you
Yeah
I know you seen me out here doing all these shows
But, baby, I get tired sometimes
You know what I'm sayin'?
You see, between doing this music and being with you
Sometimes I be like, "Yo, chill, give me a minute for me and my girl"
Dang, you be wildin' sometimes
Gotta do it (Yep)

[Verse 1]
Yo, tell me
What do you call a girl
That keeps me busy watchin' my phone, hopin' she callin' me?
What do you call it when
You wake up in the mid of the night callin' her name in your sleep?
What's the word for this?
I think about her, talk about her, feel like I can't live without her
Nobody ever made me feel like this
A rush in me, it's crushin' me
This girl means so much to me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I love her, she loves me
Call me nuts, call me crazy
(You can call me crazy)
And I think of her (Yeah), it amaze me (Yeah)
Her power stays over me
When she walks, it's like who
Yeah, when she talks, it's like who
If anybody wanna know who
Whose lady, she says me
And that's why

[Chorus]
I'm gettin' lazy when I get around you, baby
Wanna kiss, touch and hold
That's all I wanna do
I kid you not
Everything shuts down
Oh, oh, oh
You drive me crazy, yes, it does
When I get around you, baby
I get so cold when you're not around
Yeah, I kid you not
It all falls down

[Verse 2]
Uh, tell me what it is
When I make up excuses, why I can't be right on time
Somebody's dummy today
But I can always make time for you even if I'm in a bind
I swore, Sizzle, when the ladies soar
I elated close but whose wrong?
Nobody but my baby
'Cause that's the only lady that make me wanna pay me
I love her

[Pre-Chorus]
I love her, she loves me
Call me nuts, call me crazy
(You can call me crazy)
And I think of her (Yeah), it amaze me (Yeah)
Her power stays over me
When she walks, it's like who
When the girls talk, she's like who
If anybody wanna know who
Whose lady, she says me
And that's why

[Chorus]
I'm gettin' lazy, yeah, when I get around you, baby
Wanna kiss and touch and everythang

[Verse 1]
'Twas the first of May in a grocery store (Oh)
That's when my heart began to beat
Met a pretty girl in the cereal lane (Woah)
Who would have known she was right for me?
But now that I'm on the road again (All day)
She's home alone again crying
I don't need no negative energy
No, I don't

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be miserable (Hey)
But I need you in my life
(Ooh, I wanna see you happy, girl)
I wanna see you happy, girl
So stay with me and never say goodbye
Say you're gonna be home later (Lay with me)
Don't wanna come to a house that's empty
Ooh
I heard you talkin' 'bout leavin' me, but no
Don't you go

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna hear you say that ever again
I working hard for both of us
I love my friends, it's you that I depend
Call you up, I only wanna tell you nothing but sweet things
Girl, stop crying
I don't need to have you leaving me
No, I don't

I don't wanna be miserable (Yeah)
But I need you in my life

Don't you go

[Bridge]
Your friends may talk about me
(No, but they don't know me like you do)
They don't know
What I'd do for you
I'd risk my life to be with you
Girl, I love you with all of my heart (Ooh yeah)
And I will never let you go (Oh), oh no
I promise one thing's for sure (Girl)
With my heart (Listen)
And my soul (Baby)
Take everything (It don't matter)
That I own
I'd give it all for your love (Mmm)
And I'd do anything for you (Anything)
I don't care (Don't care)
Anywhere, where would I go?
I don't know
I really don't know
But I don't

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be miserable
But I need you in my life (I need you in my life)
I wanna see you happy, girl
So stay with me (Stay) and never say goodbye
Say you're gonna be home later (Lay with me)
Don't wanna come to a house that's empty

Don't you go
I don't wanna be miserable
But I need you in my life (Oh, I need you, baby)

[Intro]
Yeah, one more beat?
Yeah, yeah
I um, woke up early this morning
That's very rare
But, I felt like I haven't slept, in a while
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Forever invincible with the infinite flow
Crackin' the DaVinci code, I play the game on difficult
Could've been the G.O.A.T, but I blew it like a piccolo
My bitch alone in the bed, she feelin' miserable
I got my flaws too, locked inside this dark room
And I ain't no photographer, I'm something like a carpenter
Full of broken promises, I said I'd build a rocket for
Her to fly away in but she'd never come back
Lord knows that she's hard to faze, got a soft spot for her
She agitated in this maze, I am lost for words
You don't need binoculars to see the monikers
Gettin' popular, it feels a bit twisted, word to Oliver
Lyin' pathologically, smile at the comedy
I only sleep with a song playin' on repeat
Tryna do the right thing, I hope that poppy sees
Girl, lovin' you is all I really need

[Chorus]
Girl, don't be scared of your nightmares
You can close your eyes, I'll be right there
I ain't perfect, but I'm learning
The firewood stay burning all night
And don't give up, things will be alright
Come and dance with me like it was prom night
It's one-thousand eight-hundred twenty days I count
That me and you been playing house (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
I still remember making out on Jenny's couch
You gave me one more kiss before you let me out
Couldn't spend a day without each other, wouldn't separate
Lost in conversation, having sex could wait a week or two
In my daddy's car, talking 'til the sun came up
You slept at your moms but you text me when you wake up
Quickly came love, the pain led to break ups
You hated it, it made you sick, every time I take drugs
It's all my fault, over-dramatic, always actin' suicidal
You call me on my lies though
If love were a religion, you wrote the Bible
Wanna grow old together and watch the time go
And I would give it all back
Before I lost you again, no, I don't want that
Just wait for me, let me take my time
I'm all yours, baby, rain or shine, yeah

[Chorus]
Girl, don't be scared of your nightmares
You can close your eyes, I'll be right there
I ain't perfect, but I'm learning
The firewood stay burning all night
And don't give up, things will be alright
Come and dance with me like it was prom night
It's one-thousand eight-hundred twenty days I count
That me and you been playing house (Yeah)

[Outro]
I know the thought of forever is kinda scary
But, baby, we should get married
Give you a baby you can carry
Our love will never be ordinary
Can you pour one more Bloody Mary?
Can you pour one more Bloody Mary?
One more

[Verse 1]
I look for you
Every day, every night
I close my eyes
From the fear, from the light

[Pre-Chorus]
As I wander down the avenue, so confused
Guess I'll try and force a smile

[Chorus]
Pink lemonade sippin' on a Sunday
Couples holding hands on a runway
They're all posing in a picture frame
Whilst my world's crashing down
Solo shadow on a sidewalk
Just want somebody to die for
Sunshine livin' on a perfect day
While my world's crashing down
I just want somebody to die for

[Verse 2]
I long for you
Just a touch
Of your hand
You don't leave my mind
Lonely days, I'm feeling
Like a fool for dreaming

[Pre-Chorus]
As I wander down the avenue, so confused
Guess I'll try and force a smile

[Chorus]
Pink lemonade sippin' on a Sunday
Couples holding hands on a runway
They're all posing in a picture frame
Whilst my world's crashing down
Solo shadow on a sidewalk
Just want somebody to die for
Sunshine livin' on a perfect day
While my world's crashing down
I just want somebody to die for

[Bridge]
I just want somebody to die for
I just want somebody to die for

[Chorus]
Pink lemonade sippin' on a Sunday
Couples holding hands on a runway
They're all posing in a picture frame
Whilst my world's crashing down
Solo shadow on a sidewalk
Just want somebody to die for
Sunshine livin' on a perfect day
While my world's crashing down
I just want somebody to die for
I just want somebody to die for

[Outro]
I just want somebody to die for

[Spoken]
Do you know me?
Really know me?
You have opinions about my opinions
About my music
About my clothes
About my body
Some people hate what I wear
Some people praise it
Some people use it to shame others
Some people use it to shame me
But I feel you watching
Always
And nothing I do goes unseen
So while I feel your stares, your disapproval or your sigh of relief
If I lived by them, I'd never be able to move
Would you like me to be smaller, weaker, softer, taller?
Would you like me to be quiet?
Do my shoulders provoke you? Does my chest?
Am I my stomach? My hips?
The body I was born with
Is it not what you wanted?
If I wear what is comfortable, I am not a woman
If I shed the layers, I'm a slut
Though you've never seen my body, you still judge it
And judge me for it
Why?
We make assumptions about people based on their size
We decide who they are
We decide what they're worth
If I wear more, if I wear less
Who decides what that makes me? What that means?
Is my value based only on your perception?
Or is your opinion of me not my responsibility?

[Verse 1]
I don't want to move when I'm in her hands
There's nothing I can do or say
Put everything on hold, cancel all my plans
Everybody I'm away
She may be bad, but she feels so good
I'll give her anything she wants

[Chorus]
She's trouble, I know it
Even though it feels so good
She's trouble, I love it
Hee!
She's trouble, I know it
Even though it feels so good
She's trouble, I love it

[Verse 2]
Wanna na-na-na thrill her mind
Nothing I can gonna do
Her every move is like a danger sign
Daring me to come on through
I wanna stop but I can't say no
Even though I know it's wrong

[Chorus]
She's trouble, I know it
Even though it feels so right
She's trouble, I know it
Hee!
She's trouble, I know it
Even though it feels, babe
She's trouble, I know it

[Bridge]
She's
Know what I like
Ne-na-na
She's trouble
Na-na-na-na
Way over my head
She's trouble, I-

[Outro]
Trouble, I know it
Even though it feels so good
She's trouble, I know it
She's trouble, I know it
She's trouble, I know it
She's trouble, I know it
Even though it feels so good
For me babe
She's trouble, I know it
She's trouble, I know it (Na-na)
She's trouble, I know it
She's trouble, I know it
She's trouble, I know it
Even though it feels babe
For you babe
She's trouble, I love it
She's trouble, I love it
She's trouble, I love it
Even though it feels so good
Doo-dae
Trouble I love it
Trouble I love it
Trouble I love it
Even though it feels so good
For me babe
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo baby (Hoo!)
Doo-doo-doo-doo-na baby (Hee!)
Hee!
Trouble I know it
(That's alright, it's just ok.)

[Verse 1]
I told you 'bout Strawberry Fields
You know the place where nothing is real
Well here's another place you can go
Where everything flows

[Refrain]
Looking through the bent back tulips
To see how the other half lives
Looking through a glass onion

[Verse 2]
I told you 'bout the walrus and me, man
You know that we're as close as can be, man
Well, here's another clue for you all
The walrus was Paul

[Refrain]
Standing on the cast iron shore, yeah
Lady Madonna trying to make ends meet, yeah
Looking through a glass onion

[Bridge]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Looking through a glass onion

[Verse 3]
I told you 'bout the fool on the hill
I tell you, man, he living there still
Well, here's another place you can be
Listen to me

[Refrain]
Fixing a hole in the ocean
Trying to make a dove-tail joint, yeah
Looking through a glass onion

[Outro]
It's a goal!
It's a goal!
It's a goal!
It's a goal!
It's a goal!
It's a goal!
It's a goal!
She looks as an African Queen
She eating twelve chapattis and cream
She tastes as Mongolian lamb
She coming from out of Bahran
What a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame Mary Jane what a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
She like to be married with Yetti
He groving such cooky spaghoetti
She jumping as Mexican bean
To make that her body morphine
What a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame Mary Jane what a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
She catch Patagonian pancake
With that one and gin party makes
She having always good contact
She making with apple and contract
What a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame Mary Jane what a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
All together now
What a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame what what a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame what a shame what a shame what a shame

What a shame Mary Jane Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame Mary Jane what a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame Mary Jane what a shame
She looks as an African Queen
She tastes as Mongolian lamb
What a shame Mary Jane what a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
All together now
What a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame what what a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame what a shame what a shame what a shame

[Verse 1]
Who knows how long I've loved you, yeah?
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime?
If you want me to, I will, hmm

[Verse 2]
You know if I ever saw you
I didn't catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same

[Bridge]
Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we're together
Love you with all my heart

[Verse 3]
And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
When it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear me to you
Oh, you know, I will
I will

[Outro]
Da da da da da da da da da
Da da da da da da da

[Verse 1]
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?
No one will be watching us
Why don't we do it in the road?

[Verse 2]
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?
Yeah, why don't we do it in the road?
No one will be watching us
Why don't we do it in the road?

[Verse 3]
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?
No one will be watching us
Why don't we do it in the road?

[Verse 4]
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?
People will be watching us
Why don't we do it in the road?

[Outro]
Why don't we do it in the road?
Well, well, well
What do you think of all that?
Do you think I could do it better?
Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you, Julia

Julia

[Control room talking, John laughs] That was a great take until then
John: It was till then
Paul: Maybe try it again, there was one or two little 

[?]
John: There was just the one wasn't there?
Paul: That was great 

[?] let me tell you
John: I couldn't ha... Couldn't I go from there? Yea...
Paul: 

[?]
John: Cause that one was perfect, wasn't it?

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Joan was quizzical; studied pataphysical science in the home
Late nights all alone with a test tube, oh, oh, oh, oh
Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine calls her on the phone
"Can I take you out to the pictures, Joa-oa-oa-oan?"
But as she's getting ready to go, a knock comes on the door

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon her head
Klang! Klang! Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that she was dead

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 lines "I must not be so, o, o, o"
But when she turns her back on the boy, he creeps up from behind

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon her head
(Do-do-do-do)
Klang! Klang! Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that she was dead

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]

[Forgets words]
Painting testimonial pictures, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Forgets name] and Valerie, screaming from the gallery, say he must go free

[Laughing] does not agree and he tells them so-o-o-o
But as the words are leaving his lips, a noise comes from behind

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon his head
Klang! Klang! Maxwell's silver hammer made sure he was dead

[Outro: Paul McCartney]

[Verse 1]
If you wear red tonight
Remember what I said tonight
For red is the color that my baby wore
And what's more, it's true
Yes it is

[Verse 2]
Scarlet were the clothes she wore
Everybody knows I'm sure
I would remember all the things we planned
Understand, it's true
Yes it is, it's true
Yes it is

[Bridge]
(Mumbling)
If I could forget her, but it's my pride
Yes it is, yes it is
Oh, yes it is, yeah

[Verse 3]
"Please don't wear red tonight"
This is what I said tonight
For red is the color that will make me blue
In spite of you, it's true
Yes it is, it's true
Yes it is

[Spoken Word: Paul McCartney]
Lets hope this one turns out pretty darn good huh?

[Verse 1]
You tell lies thinking I can't see
You can't cry 'cause you're laughing at me

[Chorus]
I'm down
I'm down
I'm down
How can you laugh when you know I'm down
When you know I'm down

[Verse 2]
Man buys ring, woman throws it away
Same old thing happen everyday

[Chorus]
I'm down
I'm down
I'm down
How can you laugh when you know I'm down?
When you know I'm down?

[Guitar solo & McCartney shouts]

[Verse 3]
We're all alone and there nobody else
You still moan, "Keep your hands to yourself!"

[Chorus]
I'm down
I'm down
I'm down
How can you laugh when you know I'm down?
How can you laugh when you know I'm down?

[McCartney barks]
Keep going

[Chorus]
Oh baby I'm down
Oh yes, I'm down
Oh don't you know I'm down?
I'm down, yeah
I'm down, down, down, down, down, down, down

Wow, I'm down
Oh baby, I'm down
I'm down on the ground
I'm down
Woo, I'm hyeah
I'm down, and I'm a downer
I'll be a downer, and I'm a downer
Well yes I'm down, ow

[Spoken Word: Paul McCartney]
Ay its gonna be a goo-
Plastic soul, man, plastic soul
Plastic soul man
One, two, three, one, two, three
Hold on, hold on
I was off on that one
Alright, I'm just gonna raise this so it's near the bass strings and the top string

Paul's broken a glass, broken a glass
Paul's broken a glass, a glass, a glass, he's broke today

Okay, one, oh, you ready?
Okay, one, two, three, one, two, three

Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two-foot small
Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
How can I even try
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in
How could she say to me
Love will find a way
Gather round all you clowns
Let me hear you say

Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away

[Spoken Word: George Harrison, John Lennon, Paul McCartney & Studio Technicians]
What key is it in?
What key is it in?
It'll be in F, for you
Yesterday
I'm in G, but it'll be in F
And it goes E minor to A seventh to D minor
Ready
Here we go
Okay man

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Suddenly
There's a shadow hanging over me
I'm not half the man I used to be
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

[Outro: Paul McCartney]
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

[Verse 1]
I get high when I see you go by
My oh my
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies
Butterflies
Why am I so shy when I'm beside you?

[Chorus]
It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you

[Verse 2]
Is it right that you and I should fight
Every night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright
Very bright
Haven't I the right to make it up girl?

[Chorus]
It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you

[Outro]
Yes it's so hard loving you, loving you

[Verse 1]
Tryin' to get control
Pressure's takin' its toll
Stuck in the middle zone
I just want you alone
My guessing game is strong
Way too real to be wrong
Caught up in your show
But at least now I know

[Chorus]
It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It must have been an illusion
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It must have been a confusion

[Verse 2]
My guessing game is strong
Now that I know what's on
High like amphetamine
Maybe it's just a dream
That's what it means to crush
Now that I'm waking up
I still feel the blow
But at least now I know

[Chorus]
It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It must have been an illusion
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It must have been a confusion
It wasn't love, it wasn't love
It must have been an illusion
Mistaken for love, it wasn't love
It must have been a confusion
It must have been an illusion
It must have been a confusion

[Verse 1]
Oh no, I see
A spider web is tangled up with me
And I lost my head
And thought of all the stupid things I'd said

[Verse 2]
Oh no, what's this?
A spider web, and I'm caught in the middle
So I turned to run
And thought of all the stupid things I'd done

[Chorus]
And I, I never meant to cause you trouble
And I, I never meant to do you wrong
And I, well, if I ever caused you trouble
And oh no, I never meant to do you harm

[Verse 3]
Oh no, I see
A spider web, and it's me in the middle
So I twist and turn
But here am I in my little bubble

[Chorus]
Singing out, I never meant to cause you trouble
I never meant to do you wrong
And I, well, if I ever caused you trouble
Oh no, I never meant to do you harm

[Outro]
They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me
They spun a web for me

[Verse 1]
So I look in your direction
But you pay me no attention, do you?
I know you don't listen to me
'Cause you say you see straight through me, don't you?

But on and on
From the moment I wake, 'til the moment I sleep
I'll be there by your side, just you try and stop me
I'll be waiting in line, just to see if you care

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, did you want me to change?
Well, I'll change for good
And I want you to know
That you'll always get your way
I wanted to say—

[Chorus]
Don't you shiver
Shiver
Sing it loud and clear
I'll always be waiting for you

[Verse 2]
So you know how much I need you
But you never even see me, do you?
And is this my final chance of getting you?

But on and on
From the moment I wake, 'til the moment I sleep
I'll be there by your side, just you try and stop me
I'll be waiting in line
Just to see if you care, if you care

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, did you want me to change?
Well, I'll change for good
And I want you to know
That you'll always get your way
I wanted to say—

[Chorus]
Don't you shiver
Don't you shiver
Sing it loud and clear
I'll always be waiting for you

[Bridge]
Yeah, I'll always be waiting for you
Yeah, I'll always be waiting for you
Yeah, I'll always be waiting for you
For you I will always be waiting

[Final Chorus]
And it's you I see, but you don't see me
And it's you I hear so loud and so clear
I sing it loud and clear
And I'll always be waiting for you

[Outro]
So I look in your direction
But you pay me no attention
And you know how much I need you
But you never even see me

[Verse 1]
Did I drive you away?
I know what you'll say
You say, "Oh, sing one you know"
But I promise you this
I'll always look out for you
Yeah, that's what I'll do

[Chorus]
I say, oh
I say, oh

[Verse 2]
My heart is yours
It's you that I hold on to
Yeah, that's what I do
And I know I was wrong
But I won't let you down
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, I will, yes I will

[Chorus]
I said, oh
I cry, oh

[Bridge]
Yeah, I saw sparks
Yeah, I saw sparks
And I saw sparks
Yeah, I saw sparks
Sing it out

[Outro]
La, la, la, la, oh…
La, la, la, la, oh…
La, la, la, la, oh…
La, la, la, la, oh…
Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah they were all yellow

I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called yellow

So then I took my turn
Oh what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow

Your skin
Oh yeah your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
You know you know I love you so
You know I love you so

I swam across
I jumped across for you
Oh what a thing to do
'Cause you were all yellow
I drew a line
I drew a line for you
Oh what a thing to do
And it was all yellow

Your skin
Oh yeah your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
And you know
For you I’d bleed myself dry
For you I'd bleed myself dry

It's true
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine

Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And all the things that you do

[Verse 1]
When I counted up my demons
Saw there was one for every day
With the good ones on my shoulders
I drove the other ones away

[Chorus]
So if you ever feel neglected
And if you think that all is lost
I'll be counting up my demons, yeah
Hoping everything’s not lost

[Verse 2]
When you thought that it was over
You could feel it all around
And everybody's out to get you
Don't you let it drag you down

[Chorus]
’Cause if you ever feel neglected
And if you think that all is lost
I'll be counting up my demons, yeah
Hoping everything's not lost
If you ever feel neglected
If you think that all is lost
I'll be counting up my demons, yeah
Hoping everything's not lost

[Outro]
Singing out
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
Everything's not lost

So come on, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
Come on, yeah
And everything's not lost

And everything’s not lost

Come on, yeah
Oh, oh yeah
Sing out, yeah
And everything's not lost

Now I never meant to do you wrong
That’s what I came here to say
But if I was wrong, then I'm sorry
I don't let it stand in our way
Cause my head just aches when I think of
The things that I shouldn't have done
But life is for living, we all know
And I don’t want to live it alone

Sing out, ah ah
Sing ah ah ah
And just sing ah ah ah ah ah

On the couch, on the table, on the bar, or on the floor
You can meet me in the bathroom, yeah, you know I'm trained to go (Yeah)

[Bridge: Usher]
Might as well give me a kiss
If we keep touching like this

'Cause the way I'm staring at you got me wanting to give it to you all night

[Pre-Chorus: Usher]
(Looking in your eyes while you're on the other side)

Sexually, mentally, physically, emotionally (Ayy)

It's going down on aisle three, I'll bag you like some groceries (Woo)
And every time you think about it, you're gonna want some more of me (Yeah)
About to hit the club make a movie, yeah, rated R
Pull up like a trap star, that's if you had your Wraith car
Have you ever made love to a thug in the club with his ice on
87 Jeans and a fresh pair of Nike's on
On the couch, on the table, on the bar, or on the floor
You can meet me in the bathroom, yeah, you know I'm trained to go (Yeah)

[Bridge: Usher]
Might as well give me a kiss
If we keep touching like this
I know you're scared, baby
They don't know what we're doing
Let's both get undressed right here
Keep it up, girl, and, I swear

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Listen

[Verse 1]
Now, now she loved me, shawty, I loved her
Used to jump up in the Maybach and roll out
Used to care, she used to share
The love that she used to give me can't be found
I lost my way, she said she'd stay
And lately I've been sleeping with a ghost
My stock is down and out, I used to be worth my weight in gold
That was before the Great Depression kicked in and rocked us (Rocked us)
And that was before the hurricane came in and stopped us
I told you to leave, but you lied to me when you said that
"Baby, no worries, I promise to get us back"

[Chorus]
It's like moving mountains
It's like moving mountains

[Instrumental]

[Refrain]
Physically, physically, physically
It's like moving mountains

[Instrumental]

[Refrain]
Physically, physically, physically
It's like moving mountains

[Instrumental]

[Refrain]
It's like moving mountains

[Verse 2]
She don't touch me, I don't touch her
We rarely even ever say a word
I really want to give her everything she deserves
But the bad took away the good
She thinks that I'm full of it, arguments
Always pissed, man, I'm tired
Every kiss that I miss, girl you know I'm trying
You never believe when I say
And I never believe it when you say "I love you"
And I shouldn't complain about it
I should take it like a man and walk up out it
'Cause we will never be the same, oh
I've been standing in gas and you have been the flame

[Chorus]
And I know sorry, just wouldn't do it
Her heart is obliterated, I'm trying to get through
Gotta move this mountain, yeah
It's like moving mountains, hey
Moving mountains, it's like I'm moving mountains

[Instrumental]

[Refrain]
Physically, physically, physically
It's like moving mountains

[Instrumental]

[Refrain]
Physically, physically, physically
It's like moving mountains

[Outro]
It's like moving mountains
It's like moving mountains
It's like moving mountains
It's like moving mountains
It's like moving mountains
It's like moving mountains
It's like moving mountains
It's like moving mountains
It's like moving mountains

[Intro]
Why?
Why?

[Verse 1]
Living on the edge, out of control
And the world just won't let me slow down
But in my biggest picture
Was a photo of you and me
Girl, you know I tried
I work hard to provide all the material things
That I thought would make you happy
I'm confused, can you make me understand?
'Cause I'm trying to give you the best of me
I thought we were cool, maybe I was blind
But never took time to see

[Chorus]
Can you help me?
Tell me what you want from me
Can you help me?
Tell me why you wanna leave
Baby, help me
Without you, my whole world is falling apart
And I'm going crazy
Life's a prison when you're in love alone

[Break]
(Ooh, girl, I love you)
I need you to come back home

[Verse 2]
Girl, I put your love up on a shelf
And I guess I just left it to die
Now we're not together
'Cause I hurt you too many times
And now you're not around
I wish for every moment of time that got wasted
We used it to make sweet love
Baby, be my guide, please take my hand
Want you to know that I got you if you need it
Don't wanna be on the outside looking in
I gotta have you, girl, can't you see?

[Chorus]
Will you help me?
Tell me what you want from me
Can you help me?
Tell me why you wanna leave
Baby, help me
'Cause without you, my whole world is falling apart
And without you, I think I'll go crazy
Life's a prison when you're in love alone

[Break]
(Ooh, girl, I love you)
I need you to come back home (You know I need you)
I don't wanna be alone

[Bridge]
Please stay, don't go
I don't want it to be over
Give me another chance, I wanna be your man
Girl, you got me down here on my knees
Crying, begging, pleading, I'll do anything for your love

[Chorus]
Would you help me?
Without you, my whole world is falling apart
And without you, girl, I'm going crazy
Life's a prison without your love
Can you help me?
Tell me why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why
Can you help me?
Help me understand, I can be your man
It's driving me crazy (Crazy, crazy, crazy)
Oh, baby, oh-oh

[Intro]
Girl, I understand why
See, it's burning me to hold onto this
I know this is something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm tryna say is that, I... love you, I just...
I feel like this is comin' to an end
And it's better for me to let it go now
Than hold on and hurt you
I gotta let it burn

[Verse 1]
It's gon' burn for me to say this, but it's coming from my heart
It's been a long time coming, but we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out, but I don't think you're gonna change
I do, but you don't, think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting, baby, I ain't happy, baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

[Chorus]
When your feelin' ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumping like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn

[Verse 2]
Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here, but I want you
'Cause the feelin' ain't the same
Find myself callin' her your name
Ladies, tell me, do you understand?
Now, all my fellas, do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I know I made a mistake, now it's too late
I know she ain't coming back
What I gotta do now to get my shorty back?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Man, I don't know what I'm gonna do without my boo
You been gone for too long
It's been fifty-leven days, umpteen hours
I'ma be burning 'til you return (Let it burn)

[Chorus]
When your feelin' ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumping like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn (Let it burn, let it burn, you gon' learn)
Let it burn (Gotta let it burn), gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn

[Bridge]
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is telling me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry, ooh
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is telling me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Can you feel me burning?)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So many days, so many hours
I'm still burning 'til you return (Let it burn)

[Chorus]
When your feelin' ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumping like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn (Let it burn, let it burn), let it burn, gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through
Let it burn (Let it burn, let it burn, let it burn)
Let it burn, gotta let it burn

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
See I've been to a place, called Hell on Earth
Where your body's the same, but your heart really burns
And that kinda pain, it's more like a curse
Ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy, yeah
I was down on the ground and the tears wouldn't come
Could not make a sound, my voice wouldn't budge
Nobody around, they assumed I was done
Ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown, with Claude Kelly]
Just swear to God, swear to God, close my eyes
Kiss my chance at love goodbye
Here comes hope like a ray of light
It was your fantasy

[Chorus: Chris Brown, with Claude Kelly]
Oh
You ain't gotta climb this mountain alone
Just take my hand and I'll wait for you when you can't be strong
The worst part is over
The worst part is over
I'm here to hold you
The worst part is over

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
See the measure of love, it ain't when you're up
It's 'bout who sticks around when you can't see the sun
You've proven to be, someone I can trust
Ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown, with Claude Kelly]
Just swear to God, swear to God, close my eyes
Kiss my chance at love goodbye
Here comes hope like a ray of light
It was your fantasy

[Chorus: Chris Brown, with Claude Kelly]
Oh
You ain't gotta climb this mountain alone
Just take my hand and I'll wait for you when you can't be strong
The worst part is over
The worst part is over
I'm here to hold you
The worst part is over

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
You're that little bit of faith when I'm givin' up (Givin' up)
You're that little boost of strength when I'm against the wall (Against the wall)
And everywhere you show
Is the definition of love
Because you let me know

[Chorus: Chris Brown, with Claude Kelly]
Oh
You ain't gotta climb this mountain alone (Gotta, oh-oh)
Just take my hand and I'll wait for you when you can't be strong (I'll wait for you when you can't be strong)
The worst part is over (The worst part is over)
The worst part is over (The worst part is over)
I'm here to hold you (Here to hold you, yeah, yeah)
The worst part is over (The worst part is over)

[Outro: Chris Brown]
See I've been to a place, called Hell on Earth
But that part is over

Gonna set the roof on fire
Gonna burn this motherf— down, down, down; down, down, down, down

Come on, hands up

Put your hands on my body
Swear I seen you before

Hear no evil, or speak no evil, or see no evil
Get it, baby, hope you catch it like T.O

My life is a movie, and you just TiVo
Mami got me twisted like a dreadlock
She don't wrestle but I got her in a headlock
Yabba dabba doo, make her bed rock
Mami on fire, psh, red hot
Bada bing, bada boom
Mr. Worldwide as I step in the room
I’m a hustler, baby, but that you knew
And tonight it’s just me and you, dalé

[Chorus: Usher, Pitbull]
'Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again

You never know until you let go
We all go numb
I can feel you now
Numb
Numb
I can feel you now

[Outro]
I can feel you now

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
They say life is a battlefield
I say bring it on
If you wanna know how I feel
Live it 'til it's gone
I'm just saying that what don't kill, only makes you strong
If you don't recognize what is real
Then forever is a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long time

[Pre-Chorus]
Some things never change, here we go again
Feel like I'm losing my mind
Shake it off, let it go, I don't care anymore

[Chorus]
Just go numb
You never know until you let go
Let's go numb

[Refrain]
I can feel you now

[Verse 2]
Keep on doing the same old thing
And you expecting change
Well, is that really insanity
Or just a loser's game?
I only trust in the things I feel
Some may say that's strange
You better recognize what is real
'Cause forever is a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long time

[Pre-Chorus]
Some things never change, here we go again
Feel like I'm losing my mind
Shake it off, let it go, I don't care anymore

[Chorus]
Just go numb
You never know until you let go
We all go numb
I can feel you now
Numb
Numb
I can feel you now

[Outro]
I can feel you now

[Instrumental]

[Intro]
I can feel you now, now
I can feel you now, now
I can feel you now, now

They say life is a battlefield
I say bring it on
If you wanna know how I feel
Live it 'til it's gone
I'm just saying that what don't kill, only makes you strong

Then forever is a long, long, long, long, long, long, long, long time

Numb
I can feel you now
Numb
I can feel you now
I can feel you now
Can you feel it?
