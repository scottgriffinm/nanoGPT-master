 jam
And now let's go

[Chorus]
So, Slim Shady, to the stage please
Oh, won't you please make the place go crazy?
If you know what you doin', fellas, turn to the ladies
And tell 'em, "You just the hit the lottery, baby"
I said, "Shady, to the stage please"
Oh, won't you please make the place go crazy?
We heard the fellas, now let's hear it from the ladies
Say, "You just the hit the fucking lottery, baby"

[Verse 2]
Man, I hate it when no one's paying me any attention
So I won't let up 'til they do, I don't have any intention
Ma, I like your breast, but your booty's too skinny to pinch it
How is that possible with a waist on me about 26 inches?
Ease up on the Henny, just sip it
There's so many winches up in here that's got my interest
I'm drenched in sweat down in the trenches
Continue to make my way all the way to the center of the dance floor I've just entered
Hope that I don't get injured, oh, here I go
I'm shaking my tail for the oh-so member
Oh, feet, don't fail me now
Better be nimble when you swoop this bimb' up
Get the info on the nympho dudes went for 'cause of the way he pimped up
Shady's Mercedes Benz with the crazy rims got the ladies trembling
Like a gremlin with a head full of Red Bull at 12:15 AM and
Dude, I feel incredible, is medicine edible? You are unforgettable
Girl, the fact we didn't meet sooner is the only thing that I think's regrettable
Let me check my schedule (Shit)
Oh no, your phone number ain't even legible, this night's unmeasurable
It'd be my pleasure to introduce you to

[Chorus]
Slim Shady, to the stage please
Oh, won't you please make the place go crazy?
If you know what you doin', fellas, turn to the ladies
And tell 'em, "You just the hit the lottery, baby"
I said, "Shady, to the stage please"
Oh, won't you please make the place go crazy?
We heard the fellas, now let's hear it from the ladies
Say, "You just the hit the fucking lottery, baby"

[Verse 3]
So when you come in the club, don't care if you paid or you snuck in
Soon as you hear the beat drop, stop what you doing, start buckin'
So get up like you're up and, homie, get down like you're ducking
Up like you're stuck in the air and down like you're down on your luck
And not down like out, so just turn that frown upside down that you're stuck in
There's no upside when you're down
The only downside when you're up is being hungover
So, Shady, won't tell you 'em what's up?
Then go get your cup and refill it
Now speed it up a little bit and just kill it
Don't stand there and look at my whip, chick, get in
I ain't gotta tell you again, now close the door, you're lettin' flies in
What? Am I supposed to be air conditioning the whole outside then?
Would you look at what you're riding in?
You better take pride and stare at it for five minutes
You're lucky I didn't just drive by in it
You're privileged just to be inside of it
I stepped in this party to liven it
I just caught a vibe in it the minute that I arrived in it
So, ladies, where you at? Make some noise if you're likin' it
Then tell your boyfriend to take a hike again
Two Heinekens and you're mine
So, Slim Shady, won't you please step to the mic again? (Come on)

[Chorus]
So, Slim Shady, to the stage please
Oh, won't you please make the place go crazy?
If you know what you doin', fellas, turn to the ladies
And tell 'em, "You just the hit the lottery, baby"
I said, "Shady, to the stage please"
Oh, won't you please make the place go crazy?
We heard the fellas, now let's hear it from the ladies
Say, "You just the hit the fucking lottery, baby"

[Verse 1]
Baby, can't you see I'm calling?
A guy like you should wear a warning
It's dangerous, I'm falling
There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit, baby, give me it
You're dangerous, I'm lovin' it

[Pre-Chorus]
Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now?

[Chorus]
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?

[Verse 2]
It's getting late to give you up
I took a sip from my devil's cup
Slowly, it's taking over me

[Pre-Chorus]
Too high, can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Can you feel me now?

[Chorus]
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic?
Don't you know that you're toxic?

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?
With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under (Toxic)
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?

[Outro]
Intoxicate me now with your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now (I think I'm ready now)
Intoxicate me now with your lovin' now
I think I'm ready now

[Verse 1]
What about sunrise?
What about rain?
What about all the things that you said we were to gain?
What about killing fields?
Is there a time?
What about all the things that you said was yours and mine?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Did you ever stop to notice
All the blood we've shed before?
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, these weeping shores?

[Chorus]
Ah, ooh
Ah, ooh

[Verse 2]
What have we've done to the world?
Look what we've done
What about all the peace that you pledge your only son?
What about flowering fields?
Is there a time?
What about all the dreams that you said was yours and mine?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Did you ever stop to notice
All the children dead from war?
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, these weeping shores?

[Chorus]
Ah, ooh
Ah, ooh

[Bridge]
I used to dream
I used to glance beyond the stars
Now I don't know where we are
Although I know we've drifted far

[Chorus]
Ah, ooh
Ah, ooh
Ah, ooh
Ah, ooh

[Breakdown]
Hey, what about yesterday? (What about us?)
What about the seas? (What about us?)
The heavens are falling down (What about us?)
I can't even breathe (What about us?)
What about Africans (What about us?)
I ain't even through (What about us?)
What about nature's worth? (Ooh)
It's our planet's womb (What about us?)
What about animals? (What about it?)
Turned kingdom to dust (What about us?)
What about elephants? (What about us?)
Have we lost their trust? (What about us?)
What about crying whales (What about us?)
Ravaging the seas? (What about us?)
What about forest trails? (Ooh)
Burnt, despite our pleas (What about us?)
What about the holy land? (What about it?)
Torn apart by creed? (What about us?)
What about the common man? (What about us?)
Can't we set them free? (What about us?)
What about children dying? (What about us?)
Can't you hear them cry? (What about us?)
Where did we go wrong? (Ooh)
Someone tell me why (What about us?)
What about baby boy? (What about it?)
What about the days? (What about us?)
What about all their joy? (What about us?)
What about the man? (What about us?)
What about the crying man? (What about us?)
What about Abraham? (What about us?)
What about death again? (Ooh)
Do we give a damn?

[Outro]
Ah, hee-hee, ooh (Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!)
Ah, ooh (Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!)

[Verse 1]
Every Saturday night, I get dressed up to ride for you, baby
Cruising down the street on Hollywood and Vine for you, baby
I drive fast, wind in my hair
I push it to the limits 'cause I just don't care
You ask me where I've been; I been everywhere
But I don't want to be nowhere but here
(Come on, tell me, boy)

[Chorus]
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
(I've got a burning desire) (Come on, tell me, boy)
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
(I've got a burning desire) (Come on, tell me, boy)
I drive fast, wind in my hair
I push it to the limits 'cause I just don't care (Don't care)
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
(I've got a burning desire)

[Verse 2]
Every Saturday night I seem to come alive for you, baby
Santa Monica, I'm racing in the lights for you, baby
I drive fast, radio blares
Have to touch myself to pretend you're there
Your hands were on my hips, your name was on my lips
Over, over again like my only prayer
(Come on, tell me, boy)

[Chorus]
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
(I've got a burning desire) (Come on, tell me, boy)
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
(I've got a burning desire) (Come on, tell me, boy)
I drive fast, wind in my hair
I push it to the limits 'cause I just don't care (Don't care)
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
(I've got a burning desire)

[Bridge]
I'm driving fast, flash!
Everyone knows it
I'm trying to get to you, baby
I'm feeling scared and you know it
I'm driving fast, flash!
Everyone knows it
I'm trying to get to you, baby
I'm feeling scared and you know it

I'm driving fast, flash!
Everyone knows it
I'm trying to get to you, baby
I'm feeling scared and you know it
I'm driving fast, flash!
Everyone knows it
I'm trying to get to you, baby
I'm feeling scared and you know it
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
(I've got a burning desire) (Come on, tell me, boy)
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
(I've got a burning desire) (Come on, tell me, boy)
I drive fast, wind in my hair
I push it to the limits 'cause I just don't care (Don't care)
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
(I've got a burning desire)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Fell asleep in my first class seat
Got so much leg room, don't care if you lean back in front of me
Plus my hotel room's a presidential suite
Rolling presidential
No election
Bought the Floor I for the set, look like it's residential
Can't just call you, gotta schedule in or let me know ahead
My time is money if you talking and I hope it's 'bout some bread
Ain't nothing like them other niggas, nah, they don't even compare
Got reefer flowing through my body, money growing out my hair

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & Juicy J]
I wouldn't say I do too much but hey
I do just enough to get by
And I done been a lot of places in my day
But I never been this high
Smoking, drinking, all this got me thinking
Stacking every dollar that I'm making
Smoking, drinking, all this got me thinking
Stacking every dollar that I'm making
I smoke, you smoke, we smoke, let's smoke, away we go
I smoke, you smoke, we smoke, let's smoke, away we go

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
I probably took some time off cause I was bored of the game
I probably missed your call cause I was boarding the plane
Or some other shit
Now roll some weed, put some hash in
Light that tree up and pass it
All these clothes in my closet
Like I need all this fashion
And this car that I'm driving
Made for speed, not for crashing
If you smoking, I got it
Being broke's not the object, you feel me?

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & Juicy J]
I wouldn't say I do too much but hey
I do just enough to get by
And I done been a lot of places in my day
But I never been this high
Smoking, drinking, all this got me thinking
Stacking every dollar that I'm making
Smoking, drinking, all this got me thinking
Stacking every dollar that I'm making
I smoke, you smoke, we smoke, let's smoke, away we go
I smoke, you smoke, we smoke, let's smoke, away we go

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
Smoking weed and rolling weed
Should leave with them and roll with me
I'm in the sky, I'm in the clouds
I take my time, I break it down

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa & Juicy J]
I wouldn't say I do too much but hey
I do just enough to get by
And I done been a lot of places in my day
But I never been this high
Smoking, drinking, all this got me thinking
Stacking every dollar that I'm making
Smoking, drinking, all this got me thinking
Stacking every dollar that I'm making
I smoke, you smoke, we smoke, let's smoke, away we go
I smoke, you smoke, we smoke, let's smoke, away we go

[Verse 1]
Money
Make you feel real good
I always take it more than I know I should
You never give it away for free
You're always stealing a little love from me

[Chorus]
But you got to give it up
If you wanna live it up
You got to give it up
If you wanna live it up
Ha!

[Verse 2]
Money
Make you feel real good
You're always taking more than you know you should
You always take it, take it, take it, take it
Take it, take it, take it, take it
Take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, ah
Take it, take it, take it, take it, take it, oh

[Chorus]
Give it up
If you wanna live it up
Oh, you got to give it up
If you wanna live it up
You got to give it up
If you wanna live it up
You got to give it up
If you wanna live it up

[Bridge]
These are the parts of a terrible past
And these are the things we can live without
These are the parts of a terrible past
And these are the things we can live without
These are the parts of a terrible past
And these are the things we can live without
These are the parts of a terrible past
And these are the things we can live without

And these are the things we can live without
These are the parts of a terrible past
And these are the things we can live without
These are the parts of a terrible past
And these are the things we can live without
These are the parts of a terrible past
And these are the things we can live without

[Chorus]
You got to give it up
If you wanna live it up
You got to give it up
If you wanna live it up
Oh, you got to give it up
If you wanna live it up
You got to give it up
If you wanna live it up
You got to give it up
If you wanna live it up, up
You got to give it up, up
If you wanna live it up, up, up

[Outro]
Because these are the parts of a terrible past
And these are the things we can live without
These are the parts of a terrible past
And these are the things we can live without
These are the parts of a terrible past
And these are the things we can live without
These are the parts of a terrible past
And these are the things we can live without
These are the parts of a terrible past
And these are the things we can live without
These are the parts of a terrible past
And these are the things we can live without
These are the parts of a terrible past
And these are the things we can live without
These are the parts of a terrible past
And these are the things we can live without
These are the parts of a terrible past
And these are the things we can live without
These are the parts of a terrible past
And these are the things we can live without
These are the parts of a terrible past
And these are the things we can live without
These are the parts of a terrible past
And these are the things we can live without

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
You say you will love me
If I have to go
You'll be thinkin' of me
Somehow I will know
Someday when I'm lonely
Wishing you weren't so far away
Then I will remember
Things we said today

[Verse 2]
You say you'll be mine, girl
Till the end of time
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today

[Bridge]
Me, I'm just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is luck
And, though we may be blind
Love is here to stay and that's enough

[Verse 3]
To make you mine, girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time, girl
We'll go on and on
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today

[Bridge]
Me, I'm just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is luck
And, though we may be blind
Love is here to stay and that's enough

[Verse 3]
To make you mine, girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time, girl
We'll go on and on
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today

[Chorus]
For I have got another girl
Another girl

[Verse 1]
You're making me say that I've got nobody but you
But as from today, well, I've got somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want

[Chorus]
For I have got another girl
Another girl

[Verse 2]
She's sweeter than all the girls and I met quite a few
Nobody in all the world can do what she can do
And so I'm telling you, "This time you'd better stop"

[Chorus]
For I have got another girl
Another girl

[Bridge]
Who will love me till the end
Through thick and thin
She will always be my friend

[Verse 3]
I don't want to say that I've been unhappy with you
But, as from today, well, I've seen somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want

[Chorus]
For I have got another girl
Another girl

[Bridge]
Who will love me till the end
Through thick and thin
She will always be my friend

[Verse 3]
I don't want to say that I've been unhappy with you
But, as from today, well, I've seen somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want

[Chorus]
For I have got another girl
Another girl
Another girl

[Intro]
Mmm

[Verse 1]
She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet was the night
Softer than satin was the light
From the stars

[Verse 2]
She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet were her eyes
Warmer than May, her tender sighs
Love was ours

[Bridge]
Ours a love I held tightly
Feeling the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly
But when she left, gone was the glow of

[Verse 3]
Blue velvet
But in my heart there'll always be
Precious and warm a memory
Through the years

[Outro]
And I still can see blue velvet through my tears

[Verse 1]
Day after day, alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him, they can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

[Chorus]
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around

[Verse 2]
Well on the way, head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

[Chorus]
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
And nobody seems to like him, they can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

[Chorus]
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Round and round and round and round and round

[Verse 4]
And he never listens to them, he knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

[Chorus]
The fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around

[Outro]
Oh (Round and round and round)
Oh

Baby, you can drive my car

But I came back again

I love you so
I'm the one who wants you
Yes, I'm the one who wants you
Oh ho, oh ho, oh

You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time, I will try to show that I'm

That you would want me, too
But I got a big surprise
Oh ho, oh ho, oh

But I hate to leave you
You know I hate to leave you
Oh ho, oh ho, oh

[Outro]
You, if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again

[Verse 1]
In life, seven going symphony
I orchestrate my music willingly
Like emus? making history
Mentally we’re manipulated by the music industry
It’s conference, chivalry, creativity, lyrically step up and take a stand
But if you over-stand linguistically then represent
For it is evident that the dead president is taking our culture out of its element
And my testament is to get it back, take propaganda and insert facts
Starting a positive revolution within the rap, clash, and that’s vain called
Jewelry ice and money and women don’t mean a thang
It’s a shame what we listen to, “In actuality it’s hurting who?” Me and you
Originating a negative that America looks up to
And we think it’s cool, but in reality it’s whack
And the media associates hip hop with commercialized rap
I’m taking it back to the positivity, provocative productivity
Rebelling against this industry
Drop if it’s hot, drop it if it’s pop
Doesn't pop and lock? Then it really ain’t hip hop
So don’t cop it
But this is the only way that we are going to stop it
If they don’t make a profit then there won’t be a market
Do the math, listen to the music that comes from the soul
Most quote, unquote MC’s are in it strictly for the bankroll
And have no mind control
Behold, when the trend ends, they get back
Silly bitchin' for the check, what the fuck did you expect?

[Chorus]
Welcome to the culture
If you don’t know it’s called hip hop
If you knew, sorry for the review, but it looks like a lot forgot
We bomb cities, pop and lock
Spinning our records as we rock
To the beats on the streets kicked over a beatbox
Intellectual evolution
Consciousness distribution
Substitution soul speaking sound service is my solution
Strictly b-boy
No decoy hot boy stuck in irrelevance
Hip hop prolonging the art
Bringing it back to the elements

[Verse 2]
Let’s get back to the basics
Step one, knowledge of self
If you don’t know yourself you won’t be content with evil wealth
Many seek to find a peaceful state of mind
Assuming that finances verbalize, but you walk the line?
Ignorance is bliss
Surprise
So if you are stuck on manatary? Monetary mersany?
You will never learn that the best things in life rest eternally
I don’t put music out of my purpose, and my service
To my mental, well folk, without it the other steps are worthless
Shining, shimmering light, despite counterclockwise movements
So I listen to my intuition and let my eternal ways, and release my inking in fluent congruent fashion
Pardon the provocative exceeding ear drum boundaries, I’m lasting
So the fakes get crossed out because we don’t need ya
I’m second cheese wannabe MC’s end up taste-testing for Velveeta
Y'all some bitch-made
Paper-weight, deteriorate
On the couch ejaculate
I got to regulate
Innovate, operate, and never do shit
All you talkers make me sick
Thinking that smoking weed on your couch is gonna get you a record exec. on yo dick, and
Get you a deal?
Look in the mirror and honestly tell yourself that you are Keeping it real, but you lying
Listen to your heart and hopefully you will learn
That your actions speak louder than your words

[Chorus]
Welcome to the culture
If you don’t know it’s called hip hop
If you knew, sorry for the review, but it looks like a lot forgot
We bomb cities, pop and lock
Spinning our records as we rock
To the beats on the streets kicked over a beatbox
Intellectual evolution
Consciousness distribution
Substitution soul speaking sound service is my solution
Strictly b-boy
No decoy hot boy stuck in irrelevance
Hip hop prolonging the art
Bringing it back to the elements
Welcome to the culture
If you don’t know it’s called hip hop
If you knew, sorry for the review, but it looks like a lot forgot
We bomb cities, pop and lock
Spinning our records as we rock
To the beats on the streets kicked over a beatbox
Intellectual evolution
Consciousness distribution
Substitution soul speaking sound service is my solution
Strictly b-boy
No decoy hot boy stuck in irrelevance
Hip hop prolonging the art
Bringing it back to the elements

[Verse 3]
The drum of the heart was the start
The civilization to embark
So our art’s origin is the drum
Our cerebrum is our brain
Our body is the temple
And you treating that right, yo that’s essential to yo mental
And I wanna preach, but I figure MC’s have the power
And if they have the talent they can reach ya audience
Without displaying cockiness
Hopefully you gain insight to real but demo bumping' progress Of the occupants
Because this is rhythm
If it comes from the soul
Your skills shall unfold
And the truth shall be told
Bankrolls and hoes
Show cultural neglect
Let’s prolong this art
And show our culture respect

[Chorus]
Welcome to the culture
If you don’t know it’s called hip hop
If you knew, sorry for the review, but it looks like a lot forgot
We bomb cities, pop and lock

[Verse 1]
So I was relaxing at the spot
And some dude came through and was like, “Yo, you got flows?!”
I was like, “Of course”, and I asked him if he rhymed
And he was like, “Only when I’m off this sizzurp!”
I love to rap, I don’t even care if you’re whack
You got, flows and a beat, we can do that
He was like, “Okay, but you go first", so I spit an unedited
Spontaneous improvisational verse, and we were chillin'
Then this fool grabbed the mic and was like
“Yeah, I be killin', stackin' millions, eatin' children
Fuck a slut bitch”, I interrupted his ignorant ass
And said, “Unless you’re trying to sound like Brother Lynch
On shermstick, that the microphone you need to pass
You don’t got a Bentley, I just heard you talkin' about your bus pass”
He said, “Fool you don’t know me!
I’m crazy, blood! I'm a North End rider, just ask my homies
I jack white boys like you” I replied
“You’re white too", he said, “Honky, I wear FUBU!
I’ll fight you! Let’s go head up!”
I told him, “My man slow your roll, peep the flow and just wake up”

[Chorus: 

[?] (Sampled)]
Use your mentality, wake up to reality
Use your mentality, wake up to reality
Use your mentality, wake up to reality
Use your mentality, wake up to reality

[Verse 2]
So I was talking to one of my teachers and they asked me what kind of music I made
And I said, “Hip Hop, I’m an MC and I make beats.”
And he laughed and he’s like
“Mm, you must be like Eminem.”
First of all, hip hop is my life
My culture, my blood, and me being white
Doesn’t have anything to do with my skills
He said, “Oh you’re like Will Smith, Puff Daddy, dollar dollar bill bill?”
Nah bro
Never associate me with Eminem, bling-blingers, R&B singers
I’m just sendin' out words that the youth can relate to
So they can stay faithful
Themselves they regulate when ignorant people degrade you
You should respect one another, you’re a teacher
And still haven’t learned you shouldn’t judge a book by its cover
He said, “Oh I’m sorry brother, calm down homie, don’t bust a cap in me, word to your mother.”
I tried to help my teacher see the light
But ignorance leaves people in the dark seeing only black and white
I looked him in the eyes and told him straight up
"You can’t teach if you don’t listen, open your eyes and just wake up"

[Chorus: 

[?] (Sampled)]
Use your mentality, wake up to reality
Use your mentality, wake up to reality
Use your mentality, wake up to reality
Use your mentality, wake up to reality

[Verse 3]
So I was at the bus stop kicking a beatbox
And started conversing with some lady about music
And she asked me if it was true that
“All people have guns, smoke blunts, and drink forties in hip hop?”
So I told her
“Don’t believe everything that you hear
The news associates acculturate violence and fear
Fear extorts fear
Hip hop is universal
A positive outlet with energy flowing through the circle expressing souls without rehearsal
A conscious movement in tune with
The mental physical spiritual side of the music
It’s about love
Unfortunately, it’s stereotyped as a culture that’s based upon thugs
Hip hop is not about guns
And like all cultures, yes some hip hop heads do drugs
That’s not even relevant
In moderation, drugs can actually open eyes and expand the elements
I’ve come closer to my ancestor’s remnants
Scripting my life through the force of their spiritual presence
I use my lyrics as the evidence
You question hip hop’s drug use?
You should be questioning the President’s

[Chorus: 

[?] (Sampled)]
Use your mentality, wake up to reality
Use your mentality, wake up to reality
Use your mentality, wake up to reality
Use your mentality, wake up to reality
Use your mentality, wake up to reality
Use your mentality, wake up to reality

[Intro]
Hey, how you doing?
Man, I'm loving life right now
I'm just looking out the window and just thinking
"Look at where we live at,"
I mean this is the Pacific Northwest
This is the Almighty Kingdom
Fools be tripping like
"I'm gonna go here, I'm gonna go there"
I mean go ahead and travel
But just know
There ain't no place like the fresh coast, man

[Chorus]
We’re psilocybin spoken word carriers
Message translators
And debaters soul saviors
Sending positive vapors through the microphone to your eardrums
The movement’s through music
In tune with the almighty kingdom
We’re psilocybin spoken word carriers
Message translators
And debaters soul saviors
Sending positive vapors through the microphone to your eardrums
The movement’s through music
In tune with the almighty kingdom

[Verse 1]
I was born on this earth, a child of the sun rays
Lifted by the hands of the sand and
Ever since the first day, I saw a doorway
And eventually made my entrance
Embarked on what happened to become my fortress
The first sentence. In the ever glowing paragraph
Using words to communicate with the life forces that I call my mom and my dad
A continuous family tree
Blossoming with me in the middle of fate, destiny, and reality
As I proceeded to grow I met my love on the radio
And knew that I had to be down with the Knights of the Round Table
At the age of thirteen, began to work out my flow
Met Mind Control, and a year later pulled the sword from the stone

[Chorus]
We’re psilocybin spoken word carriers
Message translators
And debaters soul saviors
Sending positive vapors through the microphone to your eardrums
The movement’s through music
In tune with the almighty kingdom
We’re psilocybin spoken word carriers
Message translators
And debaters soul saviors
Sending positive vapors through the microphone to your eardrums
The movement’s through music
In tune with the almighty kingdom

[Verse 2]
This is the land of the enchanted
Mesmerizing beauty surrounds this planet that’s taken for granted
I see it every day
As poison unfortunately is force-fed upon the face of the human race
Leading to the decay
Of this ground that we walk on
As an organic emperor I have started on a continuous thought song
The melody’s moisture rains in my brain
His mind remains soothed by the way that this music plays
Feeling the force of the melodic texture
Harp strung, heart sprung
Toward a medieval adventure
Those inspired can attend a lecture
Kings of the continuous Casper? From now until November

[Chorus]
We’re psilocybin spoken word carriers
Message translators
And debaters soul saviors
Sending positive vapors through the microphone to your eardrums
The movement’s through music
In tune with the almighty kingdom
We’re psilocybin spoken word carriers
Message translators
And debaters soul saviors
Sending positive vapors through the microphone to your eardrums
The movement’s through music
In tune with the almighty kingdom

[Verse 3]
Feeling freedom, talk as I walk
Embark on the meadow of thought with the plot
On the future that changes, my reason rearranges
Leaving lackadaisical phases conquering the mazes
Of confusion
Mind over matter
Climb the ladder
Find and gather
The knowledge of life
A plot to music, and use it
Fluent with my words
Curve, turn, swerve, urge, and learn
The access, apply it to grammatics
Concentrate on your mindstate
Spit licks and practice
What you preach to each
For we have this, gift of life
Now it’s up to you to find happiness

[Chorus]
We’re psilocybin spoken word carriers
Message translators
And debaters soul saviors
Sending positive vapors through the microphone to your eardrums
The movement’s through music
In tune with the almighty kingdom
We’re psilocybin spoken word carriers
Message translators
And debaters soul saviors
Sending positive vapors through the microphone to your eardrums
The movement’s through music
In tune with the almighty kingdom, yeah
Blame it on the noise
Blame it on the toys
Blame it on three stripes
Mics the right of passage
For the b-boy
Consistent, twists, flips, licks
Quick was the switch
The record from the ritual typical lyrical same old skill bulllshit
Criticize all you want
Go ahead
But if everyone is taught to doubt the rap then this culture will inevitably definitely be dead
So do something, take action and then diss
For it’s people like you that are putting this art form in jeopardy questioning if it exists
It’s alive and well
Still breathing, still heating
The habitual like any creation or movement transcends nations
And it’s still teaching
Still reaching
With diverse and positive vibes
Ricocheting off the walls of venues
Keeping this culture alive
Crushing the lies
Thought it was gone?
Surprise
Obviously you missed the message
Ancient spoken tradition but musicians glisten on the stage
Cover the universal projector of the voice
As if they can dodge the artificial ecstasy craze sucking on nookies at raves
I have no patience for those who
Really do not know who
They are
And act a certain way because they feel like they’re supposed to
I remain close to
A chosen few who the spirit has spoke to
The God has been provoked soon
The faith will change their ways. X2

The journal is my sanctuary
Sacrilegious testimonies
Praisin' the powers crossed spiritually
Enhancing this ground globally
Kneeling on bended knee
Focused on the realm of thought chi
That will has
And will always take me to the peak of a pointical prophesy
Arrangement of voices
Accompanying the music in an engagement
Choir poet
To inspire the dreams delivering this eye as in embraced with
A message
Words and meaning nervous from the nectar fruit
Picked fresh off the tree ripe from the two  604 sectors
Peace to Hector
Those who laid the foundation
Never broken the sea of friends
From start till death do us part eternally through eternity I feel
From front rows at shows to family meals
Rides and automobiles
Which have manifested from taking spills on training wheels
Our memories will last forever
And I couldn’t take with thought banks
To all of my friends
I’m looking forward to the future when I will forever give thanks
Those memories will last forever
And I couldn’t take with thought banks
To all of my friends
I’m looking forward to the future when I will forever give my thanks
Chorus X2

The energy flows from the cord to man
Women and children
Those who you have spent your whole life building a relationship with
Can end
As quick as a sandwich
Your trust melted
While drowning in betrayal and disbelief
You see who is really your friends
This world is full of selfish sapiens, slithering snakes
Who will take your trust, lure you with this bait
And sell you out for their personal sake
Built on hate, smiles and popular facades
Quick to stab you in the back with the object that you thought your relationship was built on
I got your back, and you got mine cuz we’re homies
Not need to greed and selfish needs
I question who really even knows me
Myself
And when I’m by myself
And I need someone plus myself
Will they sacrifice theirself to help?
Oh I see
If that’s the way it’s got to be
I guess I was a fool to assume that we’d be down until eternity
Oh I see
If that’s the way it’s got to be
I guess in the end the only person I can truly count on is me
Chorus X2

Another reason to make it last, miss mistake up
If we break up
We smash guitars and shatter glass

[Chorus]
But 'til the day that we do
I'm your driver, and you're my screw

[Verse 2]
Everywhere that we go now, there's a show now
People pay money for the rock 'n' roll
And the big wow
Before we bow
You can call me C.C.: crowd control

[Chorus]
If you don't want to, it's cool
I'm your driver

[Verse 3]
Empty car on a fast train
In the driving rain
I can make you swear that you did some thang
What you don't know won't hurt you so
We got a long, long way to go

[Chorus]
Might as well enjoy the view
I'm your driver, and you're my screw

[Interlude]
You said you were my screw

[Verse 4]
Sharing stories and cool clothes
And party toes
This is what life is like on the road
Never too high, never too low
That's the only way to go

[Chorus]
But right now, without further ado
I'm your driver and you're my screw

[Verse 5]
Counter-clockwise, turn you round
All you got to do is listen to the sound
Music never lies, you know its true
I ain't even got to you know who
Time we got plenty of
Forever's worth the wait when it comes to love

[Chorus]
I'm your driver, and you're my screw
I'm your driver, and you're my screw
I'm your driver, and you're my screw
I'm your driver, and you're my screw
I'm your driver, and you're my screw

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
Might as well enjoy the view
I'm your driver, and you're my screw

Sniff so strong that you boys can't miss me

[Verse 1]
You ain't heard of me I keep the weed up in the air
Come up to my crib you'll see weed everywhere
3 boxes in homie I ain't stopping there
Always paid attention though but now they stop and stare
I'm fresh to the death dressed like a million bucks
Eyes Chinese smelling like a million blunts
4 zips up in the speakers of my trunk
Fuck the club owners I'm a chief when I want
Haters talk shit
Ain't going to do shit to me
Shorty on my dick cause my piff smell fruity
Don't want me blowing smoke in your face bitch sue me
Ate them other niggas
This how Pittsburgh do it
Keep a swisher moving
If don't nobody know
You going to find out why they call me Mr. Blow it by the O
I'm smoking on stage
Roll a blunt up at a show
While my niggas getting paid
Throwing money on the floor
Seen a bad bitch ain't got fronted on before
But I'm Warner Brothers now
So I stunt on every ho
Do a nigga do it bigger?
Why don't you go on and let me know?
Take your time
I'm a roll one
A cigarillo what I like called Ray
Smoke one sweet hanging high all day
Eyes all blazed
Ya'll about
Wait a minute
Still ain't found that answer to the line I was saying
That marijuana got my shit dry and all red
Really not the guy to try what y'all plant
Might break you off
But no I'm not staying
The game play to win I'm all in like when
Heard a lot of talk but you ain't saying nothing
Middle of the floor I'm a shake these guts and
Fill my Swisher with a light green substance
Every time you see me man I'm blazing something

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Smoking on exclusive so don't ask if you can hit it
Smell that is great don't even ask me where I get it
And what I pay for is way past you niggas limit
Smoke in the day
What's that bad shit you flipping?
Crack another swisher
Roll it while I'm driving
Spraying blunt block case the Po-Po up behind me
If I got some chronic
Know it's going to be diamond
If I got a bitch know she going to be diamond
Henny to the throat
Turn to smoke in my body
Heard that T-Pain, now she want to be my shorty
90 on the tank and the jeans 340
Never stop rolling
I'm a smoke til I'm retarded

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I try to stay busy
I do the dishes, I mow the lawn
I try to keep myself occupied
Even though I know you're not coming home
I try to keep the house nice and neat
I make my bed I change the sheets
I even learned how to use the washing machine
But keeping things clean doesn't change anything
What am I going to do when I run out of shirts to fold?
What am I going to do when I run out of lawn to mow?
What am I going to do if you never come home?
Tell me, what am I gonna do?

[Chorus]
I hate it
I hate it here
When you're gone

[Verse 2]
I caught myself thinking
I caught myself thinking once again
Have to try to keep my mind out of this
Try not to pretend
I'll check the phone
I'll check the mail
I'll check the phone again and I call your mom
She says you're not there and I should take care

[Chorus]
I hate it here
When you're gone
I hate it
I hate it here
When you're gone

[Outro]
I try to stay busy
I take out the trash, I sweep the floor
Try to keep myself occupied
Because I know you don't live here anymore

[Verse 1]
Oh, the band marched on in formation
The brass was phasing tunes I couldn't place
Windows open and raining in
Maroon, yellow, blue, gold and gray

[Verse 2]
The drunks were ricocheting
The old buildings downtown empty so long ago
Windows broken and dreaming
So happy to leave what was my home

[Chorus]
With a sky blue sky
This rotten time
Wouldn't seem so bad to me now
Oh, I didn't die
I should be satisfied
I survived
That's good enough for now

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
With a sky blue sky
This rotten time
Wouldn't seem so bad to me now
Oh, if I didn't die
I should be satisfied
I survived
That's good enough for now

[Intro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Lately I've been thinking, thinking 'bout what we had
I know it was hard, it was all that we knew, yeah
Have you been drinking to take all the pain away?
I wish that I could give you what you deserve

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause nothing can ever, ever replace you
Nothing can make me feel like you do
You know there's no one, I can relate to
And know we won't find a love that's so true

[Chorus]
There’s nothing like us, there’s nothing like you and me
Together through the storm
There's nothing like us, there's nothing like you and me
Together

[Verse 2]
I gave you everything, baby, everything I had to give
Girl, why would you push me away? Yeah
Lost in confusion, like an illusion
You know I'm used to making your day

[Pre-Chorus]
But that is the past now, we didn't last now
I guess that this is meant to be
Tell me was it worth it? We were so perfect
But baby I just want you to see

[Chorus]
There's nothing like us, there's nothing like you and me
Together through the storm
There's nothing like us, there's nothing like you and me
Together
There's nothing like us, there's nothing like you and me
Together through the storm
There's nothing like us, there's nothing like you and me
Together

[Verse 1]
On and on and on we'll stay together yeah
On and on and on we'll be together yeah
You and I will try to stay together yeah
On and on and on we'll be together yeah

[Chorus]
Please don't cry we're designed to die
Don't deny what's inside
On and on and on we'll stay together yeah
On and on and on
On and on and on

[Verse 2]
One day we'll disappear together in a dream
However short or long our lives are going to be
I will live in you or you will live in me
Until we disappear together in a dream

[Chorus]
Please don't cry we're designed to die
You can't deny even the gentlest tide
On and on and on we'll be together yeah
On and on and on
On and on and on
We're going to try

[Verse 3]
Please don't cry
This world of words and meanings makes you feel
Outside
Something that you feel already
Deep inside
You've denied
Go ahead and cry

[Outro]
On and on and on we'll stay together yeah
On and on and on
On and on and on

You and I will stay together yeah
You and I will try to make it better yeah

[Chorus]
Cause I’ll put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
Baby, it’s keeping me dry
I put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
You know exactly why

[Pre-Chorus]
When the wind blows and the sun goes away on the sinful, stormy day
It’s what it’s for yeah, it’s what it’s for yeah
And as it pours down, the water sprinkles off my chest jacket slow, yeah, jacket slow, yeah
Whenever do I ever, do I ever want this to faze me?
Whenever do I ever, do I want this thing to make me?
Cause the fame and the money and the girls drive you crazy
And all the he said, she said, I'm thinking maybe, just put on my

[Chorus]
Cause I’ll put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
Baby, it’s keeping me dry
I put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
You know exactly why

[Verse 1]
But, as I look around I see
Well nothing can never change me, yeah
Well all I gotta do is stay me
Let the rest do the work and I’ll show that I’ll be fine, be fine

[Pre-Chorus]
When the wind blows and the sun goes away on the sinful, stormy day
It’s what it’s for yeah, it’s what it’s for yeah
And as it pours down, the water sprinkles off my chest jacket slow, yeah, jacket slow, yeah
Whenever do I ever, do I ever want this to faze me?
Whenever do I ever, do I want this thing to make me?
Cause the fame and the money and the girls drive you crazy
And all the he said, she said, I'm thinking maybe, just put on my

[Chorus]
Cause I’ll put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
Baby, it’s keeping me dry
I put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
You know exactly why

[Bridge]
Just put on my, just put on my, just put on my

[Chorus]
Cause I’ll put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
Baby, it’s keeping me dry
I put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat

Ho, I hope this ego trip you on won't last honey
Cause everyone you get around got you gas money

And can't make a move from his momma house in Ajax

[Interlude]

All the dope that I get, I stretch it
Going overboard to make my mission
Severing heads to send a message

Rihanna this inspired me mamita
So you know Mr. worldwide had to check in
This beat’s perfect for me to teach the world a little bit more about me

[Verse 1:Pitbull]
Before you speak, listen
I always make it happen
I don’t believe in wishing or wishes or should've or would've or could've or can't or won't
So don’t, don’t come to me with that there
Epitome of irony, I’m a gentleman bastard
Burn me, throw me in the ocean, ya'll can keep the casket
I see who you not so let's see how long that mask fit
My whole life’s been a flagrant fail but somehow I still made the basket
Yeah they all tough behind the mic, I bet
Until they get they ass kicked
I’m a diamond in the rough I ain't cut right
And make sure when you cutting things that they're cut right
I don't floss, I don't rock ice, but if you listen and learn
Then I just might
Show you how I took my life from soft white
To playing cards with Rihanna at the same night
In Tokyo baby, let's ride
Now that’s what you call two diamonds in the sky

[Hook:Rihanna]
Shine bright, tonight you and I
We’re beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive
We’re beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We’re beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shining bright like a diamond
We’re beautiful like diamonds in the sky

[Verse 2:Rihanna]
Palms rise to the universe
As we moonshine and molly
Feel the warmth, we’ll never die
We’re like diamonds in the sky
You’re a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I’m alive
We’re like diamonds in the sky

[Pre-Hook]
At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

[Hook]
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
While you make pretty speeches
I'm being cut to shreds
You feed me to the lions
A delicate balance

[Verse 2]
When this just feels like
Spinning plates
I'm living in Cloud Cuckoo Land
And this just feels like
Spinning plates
My body's floating down the muddy river

[Intro: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Heh, so I'm out the game, huh? (Huh, huh)
Yo, Dre, we ridin'?
Whatever (Ha-ha)
Well, I'm wit' ya, homie
Okay, let's handle the small shit

[Verse 1: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
I was born to brew up storms, stir up shit
Kick up dust, cuss 'til I slur up spit
Grew up too quick, went through too much, knew too much shit
Corrupt, and I'ma pour it on like syrup, bitch
Thick and rich, sick and twisted, Mr. Buttersworth
Dre told me to milk this shit for what it's worth
'Til the cow just tilts and tips and stumbles to Earth
And if I fumble a verse, keep goin'
First take I make, mistakes, just keep it
No punches pull, no punches, that's weak shit
Fake shit, if I ever take shit, I'll eat shit
Wasn't for him, wouldn't be shit
Creep with me as we take a little trip down memory lane
Been here longer than anyone in the game
And I ain't got to lie about my age — But what about Jermaine?
Fuck Jermaine! He don't belong speakin' mine
Or Timbaland's name and don't think I don't read
Your little interviews and see what you're sayin'
And I'm a giant, and I ain't gotta move 'til I'm provoked
When I see you, I'ma step on you and not even know it
You midget, mini-me with a bunch of little mini-you's
Runnin' around your backyard swimming pools
Over 80 million records sold
And I ain't have to do it with 10- or 11-year-olds

[Chorus: Eminem]
‘Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' with
Huh? (Huh, huh, huh)
‘Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' with
Huh? (Huh, huh, huh)

[Verse 2: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Second verse, it gets worse, it gets no better than this
Amateurs drink veteran piss
From a Dixie cup, if you ever mix me up
Or confuse me with a Canibus or Dre with a Dupri
We'll rub it in, every club you're in, we'll have you blackballed
And make sure you never rap a-fuckin'-gain
Dre ain't havin' it, long as I'm here to play devil's advocate
If there was some magic shit I could wave
Over the industry that could save it when I'm gone
And buried to make sure the tradition carries on, I would
If I could only use this power for good I wouldn't, not even if I could
From the hood, and I'm a hornet
And I'ma only sting when I'm cornered
And I'ma only sucker punch and swing without warning
And swing to knock somebody's fuckin' head off
‘Cause I know if they get up, I won't get a chance to let off
Another punch, I'm punk rock, no one's punk
Don't give a fuck: white-Pac, so much spunk
When I was little I knew I would blow up and sell a mil'
Or grow up to be Attila, go nuts and be a killer
And I'm something of a phenom, one puff of the chron'
I'm unstoppable, I'm alive and
On top again, there's no obstacle that I can't conquer
So come along with us (C'mon!)

[Chorus: Eminem]
‘Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' with
Huh? (Huh, huh, huh)
‘Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' with
Huh? (Huh, huh, huh)

[Verse 3: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Now anybody who knows Dre knows I'm about
Fast cars and Alizé, partyin' all day
But I handled my business, ‘cause it's work before play
Don't look for trouble, but I'll serve you gourmet
However you want it, you can have it your way
You fuck my night up, I'ma fuck up your day
Bullet with your name, sendin' it your way
That goes for anyone who walks through that doorway
‘Cause this is my space, you invade it
Live to regret it, and you'll die tryna violate it
Fuck around, get annihilated, eyes dilated
Huh, like my old lady?
‘Cause what you say is what you say, sometimes what you mean
Is two different things, depending on your mood if it swings
Think too many things, little hit of Dre's weed
I can do anything, catch a contact
And I'm gone, and I'm back, I speed write
And my loose leaf's my launchpad — And I can pull any string
Don't have to prove anything, catch a contract
On your head, you headed West, talk shit about Dre
You better get a vest and invest in something to protect
Your head and neck — And it's back and forth
All day, like Red and Meth, I joke when I say I'm the best
In the booth, but a lot of truth is said in jest
And if I ever do live to be a legend
I'ma die a sudden death; five mics in The Source?
Ain't holdin' my fuckin' breath, but I'll suffocate for the respect
'Fore I breathe to collect a fuckin' check

[Chorus: Eminem]
‘Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' with
Huh? (Huh, huh, huh)
‘Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you sayin' it, just remember
How you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' with
Huh? (Huh, huh, huh)

[Outro: Dr. Dre & Timbaland]
Watch your fuckin' mouth
Yo, this Timbaland, tell him I said suck my dick

[Verse 1]
If you wear red tonight
Remember what I said tonight
For red is the color that my baby wore
And what's more, it's true
Yes it is

[Verse 2]
Scarlet were the clothes she wore
Everybody knows I'm sure
I would remember all the things we planned
Understand, it's true
Yes it is, it's true
Yes it is

[Bridge]
I could be happy with you by my side
If I could forget her, but it's my pride
Yes it is, yes it is
Oh, yes it is, yeah

[Verse 3]
"Please don't wear red tonight"
This is what I said tonight
For red is the color that will make me blue
In spite of you, it's true
Yes it is, it's true
Yes it is

[Bridge]
I could be happy with you by my side
If I could forget her, but it's my pride
Yes it is, yes it is
Oh, yes it is, yeah

[Verse 3]
"Please don't wear red tonight"
This is what I said tonight
For red is the color that will make me blue
In spite of you, it's true
Yes it is, it's true
Yes it is, it's true

[Intro: Paul McCartney]
One, two, three, four!

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney, McCartney & John Lennon]
Well, she was just seventeen and you know what I mean
And the way she looked was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another? (Oh)
When I saw her standing there?

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney, McCartney & John Lennon]
Well, she looked at me, and I, I could see
That before too long, I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another (Woah)
When I saw her standing there

[Bridge: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Well, my heart went "boom" when I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney, McCartney & John Lennon]
Well, we danced through the night, and we held each other tight
And before too long, I fell in love with her
Now, I'll never dance with another (Woah)
Since I saw her standing there

[Guitar Solo: George Harrison]

[Bridge: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Well, my heart went "boom" when I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney, McCartney & John Lennon]
Oh, we danced through the night, and we held each other tight
And before too long, I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another (Oh)
Since I saw her standing there

[Outro: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Oh, since I saw her standing there
Yeah, well, since I saw her standing there

[Verse 1]
I got something to say that might cause you pain
If I catch you talking to that boy again
I’m going to let you down
And leave you flat
Because I told you before
Oh, you can’t do that

[Verse 2]
Well, it’s the second time I’ve caught you talking to him
Do I have to tell you one more time, I think it’s a sin
I think I'll let you down (Let you down)
And leave you flat (Going to let you down and leave you flat)
Because I told you before
Oh, you can’t do that

[Bridge]
Everybody's green
'Cause I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen
You talking that way
They'd laugh in my face

[Verse 3]
So please listen to me if you want to stay mine
I can’t help my feelings, I go out of my mind
I'm going to let you down (Let you down)
And leave you flat (Going to let you down and leave you flat)
Because I told you before
Oh, you can’t do that!

[Guitar Solo]
(You can't do that)
(You can't do that)
(You can't do that)
(You can't do that)
(You can't do that)

[Bridge]
Everybody's green
'Cause I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen
You talking that way
They'd laugh in my face

[Verse 4]
So please listen to me if you want to stay mine
I can’t help my feelings, I go out of my mind
I'm going to let you down (Let you down)
And leave you flat (Going to let you down and leave you flat)
Because I told you before
Oh, you can’t do that!

[Verse 1]
Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two-foot small
Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

[Chorus]
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away

[Verse 2]
How can I even try
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in
How could she say to me
Love will find a way
Gather round all you clowns
Let me hear you say

[Chorus]
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away

Bitch nigga, punk ho, punk ho FIGHTIN WORDS!
The first time we ever got a chance to be alone we knew
That it was wrong to do
Guess that's why I was drawn to you
The second time leads to the third, the fifth, the seventh time
I feel so alive, it won't last but it's alright
Fleeting joy and fading ecstasy, here it goes again, oh
Sneaking fruit from the forbidden tree, sweet taste of sin

And I'm doing it again; Yes I'm doing it again, oh I'm doing it again I said it would end but here it goes again

This time you told me you saw me at the same hotel
You said you knew me well, and I had a familiar smell
You asked me how am I ever going to learn to put my trust in you
Like you want me to, 'cause I know what you're prone to do
Accusations fly like bullets do, here it goes again oh
You know me because you're doing it too

The cycle never ends, never ends
Oh you're doing it again
Yes you're doing it again
Oh you're doing it again
You said it would end but here it goes again
And again, and again
Damn I love you, but this is crazy
I have to fight you almost daily
We break up so fast
And we, we make up so passionately
Why can't we just trust each other
You can't hate me and be my lover
Passion ends, and pain begins, I come back...

And we're doing it again
Yes we're doing it again
Oh we're doing it again
We said it would end
But, here it goes again

Each time you call me home in a sweet refrain
Saying things will change, you'll take away the pain
Then we flashback to the first time you put your spell on me
You envelope me, you feel good as hell to me
One moment leads to another few
Here it goes again oh
Oh leaving you is oh so hard to do
I just can't pretend, can't pretend
I keep doing it again, oh I'm doing it again
Yes I'm doing it again
I said it would end, oh,oh, oh
Oh I'm doing it again
I said it would end, oh,oh, oh
Oh I'm doing it again
I said it would end but here it goes again
Again

[Chorus]
There's a natural mystic blowing through the air
If you listen carefully now you will hear

[Verse 1]
This could be the first trumpet, might as well be the last
Many more will have to suffer
Many more will have to die
Don't ask me why
Things are not the way they used to be
I won't tell no lie

[Verse 2]
One and all got to face reality now
Though I've tried to find the answer to all the questions they ask
Though I know it's impossible to go living through the past
Don't tell no lie

[Chorus]
There's a natural mystic blowing through the air
Can't keep them down
If you listen carefully now you will hear

[Bridge]
Such a natural mystic, blowing through the air

[Verse 3]
This could be the first trumpet, might as well be the last
Many more will have to suffer
Many more will have to die - don't ask me why

[Chorus]
There's a natural mystic blowing through the air
I won't tell no lie
If you listen carefully now you will hear
There's a natural mystic blowing through the air

[Outro]
Such a natural mystic blowing through the air
There's a natural mystic blowing through the air
Such a natural mystic blowing through the air
Such a natural mystic blowing through the air
Such a natural mystic blowing through the air

[Chorus: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Don't let me down, don't let me down

[Chorus]
Hey, what's up?
This is a jam, turn it up
Play it loud in the club

Nappy Boy!

[Verse 1]
Come here shawty
Let me show you what a real nigga look like
Let me show you what a real nigga look like
1, 2 step, Teddy bells on foot right
Holla at me 'fore you tell a nigga goodnight
I know you from the country
Show me what you cook like
Come to the crib, I got a person to cook light
And I know a lot of niggas say the same thing
But that's 'cause they trynna be just like me
But I'm icy, I never been dull
Unless I'm in the courtroom in front of the judge
And that ain't never gon' happen, we can get it cracking
You ain't never gotta worry about me skipping off
Baby if you with it, we can go 'n kick it off
'Cause you ain't gotta really worry about nothing at all
So tell me if you with it
Know that I ain't never bullshitting
Go ahead and give a nigga the business
I got to go

[Hook]
Girl I go to go
If you not busy baby
Come with me flying on my airplane
Ain't gotta say no more
Unless we sitting high on 26's
Girl, that 'bout the same thing
Ooh, girl i got to go
You cooking with gas now
Let me see that ass bounce girl
You ain't gotta say no more
Go around the world with the best of them
Not worried about the rest of them, girl
I ain't gotta say no more

[Verse 2]
Come here bitch let me show you what a foul mouth nigga is
Let me show you what a down south nigga is
Grits and eggs, tits and legs, thick as bread
I ain't know how you was but I figured it
Was gon' be like this - or like this
Tattoos from your ankle to your white wrist
Drop a top so far in a white whip
Dark chocolate bar, you can bite this
See, life is a movie
Keep running from your feeling, you'll eventually fall like a white bitch
And I know you wanna do me
I ain't trynna be nasty
I'm way too fly, where's my kite, bitch
My bad, I ain't trynna be cussing
No disrespect, that's just how I does it
Blue Bentley, rims with the buttons
Lets go get some food or something

[Hook]
Girl I go to go
If you not busy baby
Come with me flying on my airplane
Ain't gotta say no more
Unless we sitting high on 26's
Girl, that 'bout the same thing
Ooh, girl i got to go
You cooking with gas now
Let me see that ass bounce girl
You ain't gotta say no more
Go around the world with the best of them
Not worried about the rest of them, girl
I ain't gotta say no more

[Hook]
You can be my superstar
We can do anything you want
Whoo-ooowhooo

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Yeah, what say you my dear
We drink get drunk go straight to the crib
Got a thing for Ms. Thang over there
Them yellow diamonds lead straight to the Wiz
Entrepreneur, got straight to the biz
Jumped in my car, spaceship that is
And we fly out, them expensive things that we try out
Most lie about
You got me like Ne-Yo gone girl
Do your own thing, I can see in your own world
Got my homeboy spring cleanin' your homegirl
And shawty we gonna do this shit right
I'm tryna find a bottle of anything that you like
To wait I got no time I'm trying to take you tonight
And if you wanna roll, then maybe we can go
I ain't showing off this is really my life, yeah

[Hook]
Leave with us never be the same, you reppin' with the planes

[Hook]

Hahahaha. Yeah bitch! Uh! Haha
Yeah, bottles going off and I ain't concerned with how much it's gonna cost me
I'm-a drink it straight probably order you a long beach
Waiter bring the drinks I'm-a roll some of this bomb weed
Somewhere in outer space or somewhere under a palm, tree
The flyest thing you ever been on, me
And them other niggas claim to be the planes
But how they leave them land when they're on, E
No fuel, though my swag is sicker than no cure
Maybe it's all the alcohol making me so sure
Damn, baby we cop the brochure we gon' shop at those stores
Presidential panel, on top of those floors
Say you got fans I got lots of homeboys
And they love to smoke and chill like I do
So come to my hotel bring your friends and they can get high too
And

[Hook]
Hahaha, yeah, bitch!
Leave with us never be the same, you reppin' with the planes

[Hook]

[Intro: Andy Samberg & Adam Levine]
YOLO, you only live once
The battle cry of a generation
This life is a precious gift
So don't get too crazy
It's not worth the risk
Yeah

[Chorus 1: Adam Levine]
You know that we are still young
So don't be dumb
Don't trust anyone
'Cause you only live once

[Verse 1: Kiv, Jorm, & Andy]
Uh, you only live once, that's the motto
So take a chill pill, ease off the throttle
Never go to loud clubs 'cause it's bad for your ears
Your friends will all be sorry when they can't hear
And stay the hell away from drugs 'cause they not legal
Then bury all your money in the backyard like a beagle
'Cause you should never trust a bank, they've been known to fail
And never travel by car or bus, boat or by rail
And don't travel by plane, and don't travel at all
Build a bomb shelter basement with titanium walls
And wear titanium suits in case pianos fall on you
And never go to saunas 'cause they're crawlin' with piranhas
And never take the stairs 'cause they're often unsafe
You only live once, don't let it go to waste

[Chorus 2: Adam Levine]
You know that we are still young
So hold off on the fun
Cook your meat till it's done
'Cause you only live once

[Verse 2: Kiv, Jorm, & Andy]
Yeah, and here's another piece of advice
Stay away from kids, 'cause their hair is filled with mad lice
There's no such thing as too much Purell
This a cautionary tale, word to George Orwell
So don't 1980-force any plugs into sockets
Always wear a chastity belt and triple lock it
Then hire a taster, make him check your food for poison
And if you think your mailman is a spy, then destroy him
No blankets or pajamas, they can choke you in your sleep
Two words about furniture: killing machines
Now, board your windows up the sun is bad for your health
And always wear a straitjacket so you're safe from yourself

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh huh, take no chances, stop freelancin'
Invest in your future, don't dilute your finances
401K, make sure it's low risk
Then get some real estate (how much?), 4.2%
Thirty year mortgage, that's important, that's a great deal
And if you can't afford it, don't forge it on your last bill
Renting is for suckers right now
A dependable savings
And you'll retire with money in your account
Beast!

[Bridge: All]
YOLO, say no-no
Isolate yourself and just roll solo, be careful-o
You Oughta Look Out also stands for YOLO

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
You know that we are still young
Burn the prints off your thumbs
Then pull out all your teeth
So you can't bite your tongue

[Bridge: All]
Only on this earth for a short time, time
So don't go outside, cause you don't want to die, die
Just take our advice and hide
And scream YOLO to the sky

[Outro: Andy]
You oughta look out

[Chorus]
I see you driving around town with the girl I love
And I'm like, "Forget you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like: "Forget you and forget her, too"
Said if I was richer
I'd still be with ya
Hah, now ain't that some shh? (Ain't that some shh?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a forget you (Oh, ooh, oooh)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm sorry, I can't afford a Ferrari
But that don't mean I can't get you there
I guess he's an Xbox and I'm more Atari
But the way you play your game ain't fair

[Pre-Chorus]
I pity the fool that falls in love with you
(Oh shh, she's a gold digger)
Well.. (Just thought you should know)
(Ooh) I've got some news for you
("...Yeah, go run and tell your little boyfriend")

[Chorus]
I see you driving around town with the girl I love
And I'm like, "Forget you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like: "Forget you and forget her, too"
Said if I was richer
I'd still be with ya
Hah, now ain't that some shh? (Ain't that some shh?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a forget you (Oh, ooh, oooh)

[Verse 2]
Now I know, that I had to borrow
Beg and steal and lie and cheat
Trying to keep ya, trying to please ya
'Cause being in love with your... ain't cheap, nah

[Pre-Chorus]
I pity the fool, that falls in love with you
(Oh shh, she's a gold digger)
Well... (Just thought you should know)
(Ooh) I've got some news for you
("...Ooh, I really hate yo'... right now")

[Chorus]
I see you driving around town with the girl I love
And I'm like, "Forget you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like: "Forget you and forget her, too"
Said if I was richer
I'd still be with ya
Hah, now ain't that some shh? (Ain't that some shh?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a forget you (Oh, ooh, oooh)

[Bridge]
Now baby, baby, baby, why d'you wanna, wanna hurt me so bad?
(So bad, so bad, so bad)
I tried to tell my momma, but she told me:
"This is one for your dad"
(Your dad, your dad, your dad)
Yes, she did, and I'm like
Uh! Why? Uh! Why? Uh! Why lady?!
Oh, I love you
Oh, I still love you, ooh

[Chorus]
I see you driving around town with the girl I love
"Forget you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like: "forget you," and forget her, too
Said if I was richer
I'd still be with ya
Hah, now ain't that some shh? (Ain't that some shh?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a forget you (oh, ooh, oooh)

[Verse 1]
What will you say when the day comes
When it's no fun
When it's all done
When it's no fun
What will you say when the time comes
There's a dry run
When it's undone
And it's no one

[Chorus]
When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much
It's too much love
Too much love
Too much

[Verse 2]
What will you do when you wake up
Fatten you up
Fasten you up
Fatten you up
No memories to get cloudy
To get cloudy
When you can't see
What you can't see
It's all the same when it's morning
And you're boring
Still ignoring
Everything
No memories to remind you of the old you
Nothing for it
Just keep it up
Keep it up

[Chorus]
When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much
When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much

[Verse 1]
What will you say when the day comes
When it's no fun
When it's all done
When it's unfun
What will you say when the time comes
There's a dry run
When it's undone
And it's no one

[Chorus]
When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much
It's too much love
Too much love
Too much

[Verse 2]
What will you do when you wake up
Fatten you up
Fasten you up
Fatten you up
No memories to get cloudy
To get cloudy
When you can't see
What you can't see
It's all the same when it's morning
And you're boring
Still ignoring
Everything
No memories to remind you of the old you
Nothing for it
Just keep it up
Keep it up

[Chorus]
When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much
When it's too much love
Too much love
Too much

[Bridge]
With no memory
With no memory
With no memory
To keep you up at night

With no memory
With no memory
With no memory
To keep you up at night

[Verse 1]
Everybody makes mistakes
But I feel alright when I come undone
You are not making me wait
But it seems alright as long as something's happening
I try to make you late
But you fighting me off like a fire does
You try making me wait
But it feels alright as long as something's happening

[Chorus]
Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations

[Verse 2]
You try to make me wait
You come around when it's come undone
Everybody makes you late
And it's never you because you're always thinking
I try making you wait
And give you me some like you give it good
Everybody makes mistakes
But it seems it's mine that always keep on stinging

[Chorus]
Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations
Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations

[Verse 3]
You try making me wait
But you come undone when you come undone
Everybody makes mistakes
But it's always mine that seem to keep on sticking

[Chorus]
Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations
Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations
Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations
Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations
Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations

[Verse 1]
It's like a movement from the small place
To a bigger city
Or it's a bigger bag to strap the ego of a little baby
It's like a discipline without the discipline of
All of the discipline
It's like a culture
Without the effort of all of the culture

[Chorus 1]
Oh but I'm tapped
You're pillaging and I'm tapped
You're yesterday
And I'm tapped
Another reason I'm tapped

[Verse 2]
It's like a movement
Without the bother of all of the meaning
It's like a discipline
Without the discipline of all of the discipline
It's like a fat guy in a T-shirt
Doing all the singing
It's like a couple dads and a few friends
Trying hard to stay in

[Chorus 2]
You're history and I'm tapped
You're fast and easy 'n I'm tapped
You're pillaging
And I'm tapped
For best results well I'm tapped

[Verse 3]
Here comes the report nothing to report see
It's all the same
It seems the punk rock as an experiment well
It pulled up lame
You got the fat guy in the T-Shirt
Doing all the singing
Straight to the drunk tank doing the research 'n
Doing all the blame

[Chorus 2]
You're history and I'm tapped
You're fast and easy 'n I'm tapped
You're pillaging
And I'm tapped
For best results well I'm tapped

[Verse 1]
It's like a movement from the small place
To a bigger city
Or it's a bigger bag to strap the ego of a little baby
It's like a discipline without the discipline of
All of the discipline
It's like a culture
Without the effort of all of the culture

[Chorus 1]
Oh but I'm tapped
You're pillaging and I'm tapped
You're yesterday
And I'm tapped
Another reason I'm tapped

[Verse 2]
It's like a movement
Without the bother of all of the meaning
It's like a discipline
Without the discipline of all of the discipline
It's like a fat guy in a T-shirt
Doing all the saying
It's like a couple dads and a few friends
Trying hard to stay in

[Chorus 2]
We're history and I'm tapped
You're fast and easy 'n I'm tapped
You're pillaging and I'm tapped
For best results well I'm tapped

[Verse 3]
Here comes the report nothing to report see
It's all the same
It seems the punk rock as an experiment well
It pulled up lame
We have the fat guy in a T-Shirt
Doing all the singing
Straight to the drunk tank doing the research 'n
Doing all the blame

[Chorus 2]
You're history and I'm tapped
You're fast and easy 'n I'm tapped
You're pillaging and I'm tapped
For best results well I'm tapped

[Verse 4]
It's like the culture
Without the effort or all of the luggage
It's like a discipline
Without the discipline of all of the discipline
It's like a movement
Without the bother of all of the meaning
It's like a culture
Without the culture of all of the culture

[Chorus 2]
You're history and I'm tapped
You're fast and easy 'n I'm tapped
You're pillaging and I'm tapped
You're pillaging and I'm tapped

[Outro]
Here's the change

[Verse 1]
I'm wasted and complacent
And you about the same
But still I want to get it
On with you tonight
When I was a little boy
I laid down in the grass
I'm sure you'd feel the same if I
Can fuck you here tonight

[Chorus]
But I'm never as tired as when I'm waking up
No I'm never as tired as when I'm waking up
But it feels like I'm in love again
No it feels like I'm in love again
Though it feels like I'm in love again
With what ya do

[Verse 2]
If we made it happen
I'm sure what we would do
We'd run outside and fuck someone
To show it didn't mean a thing
Seems it could be simple
If I could just grow up
Never gonna get it now
'Cause I'll never grow

[Chorus]
But I'm never as tired as when I'm waking up
No I'm never as tired as when I'm waking up
And it feels like I'm in love again
No it feels like I'm in love again
Though it feels like I'm in love again
With what ya do
But not with you

[Outro]
(I keep on telling myself it's you) But not with you
(I keep on telling myself it's you) But not with you
(I keep on telling myself it's you) But not with you
(I keep on telling myself it's you) I'm not with you
(Just keep on telling myself it's you) But not with you
(I keep on telling myself it's you) But not with you
(Just keep on telling myself it's you) But not with you
(Just keep on telling myself it's you) But not with you
(Just keep on telling myself it's you)
(Just keep on telling myself it's you)
A beat's on repeat, beating on me
From every car in the street
It's a constant repeat, on repeat
Of your paranoid heartbreaking beats
On repeat

It's a five song repeat beating on me
Your favorite band helps you sleep
And here comes the new stylish creep
From every car in the street
On repeat
On repeat
On repeat

Don't tell nobody what, what you really want because
They can tell everybody else what you really want
Then you're fucked, so act like it's for yourself or it's all yours
And they go and tell everybody else that you're really great
We are just people

You're enfranchised and entranced
You're enfranchised and entrenched
But know that it's yours!
Real life's a compromise
But your beats are half-assed, streak is beating on me
Well, I'm drinking, the weak is helping me sleep
I wish I could complain more about the rich but then
All their children would run the streets
And come to every show, no one wants that
I wish I could complain more about the rich but then
All their children would flee the schools
And come to every show, drugged and unwashed
I wish I could complain more about the rich but then
All their children would line the streets
And come to every show unwashed and drugged and

Beats are on repeat, beating on me
On your radio
On your radio
On your radio
On your radio
On your radio
On your radio

Beats are on repeat, beating on me
Beats on repeat, beating on me

[Verse 1]
But all I know, is all I know
Is the disco infiltrator fo' sho
But all I see, is all I see
But still you want it
Stop, you can't believe, what you believe
Or the disco infiltrator will leave
Oh stupid me, oh stupid me
But still we want it

[Chorus]
Stop, we can't shake the waist
Stop, you've got to shake the waist

[Verse 2]
Stop, what you've been told, is what you're told
Is the disco infiltrator gone cold
Oh stupid you, I bet' told the truth
But you don't want it no!
Stop, you make me frown your little town
You run the disco infiltrator on down
Oh stupid you, oh stupid me
And we deserve it

[Chorus]
Stop, you can't take the waste
Stop, you've got to shake your waist

[Bridge]
Bear in mind, we all fall behind, from time to time
Bear in mind, we all fall behind, from time to time

[Verse 3]
But all I know, is all I know
Is the disco infiltrator fo' sho
But all I see, is all I see
But still you want it
Stop, you can't believe, what you believe
Or the disco infiltrator will leave
Oh stupid me, oh stupid me
But still we want it

[Chorus]
Stop, you can't shake your waist
Stop, you've got to shake your waist
Stop, you can't shake your waist
Stop, you've got to shake your waist

[Bridge]
Bear in mind, we all fall behind, from time to time
Bear in mind, we all fall behind, from time to time
Bear in mind, we all fall behind, from time to time
Bear in mind, we all fall behind, from time to time
Bear in mind, we all fall behind, from time to time
Bear in mind, we all fall behind, from time to time
And it feels like it won't come off
And it tastes like you're full of love
Still the time never to pay off
Still the time never to pay off
And it feels like I'm coming home
And it's smells like I'm learning now
And it feels like it's coming on
And it feels like it's full of cum
Still in time is the great release
Someday dying will be a great release
Da da daa

[Chorus]
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah hey hey hey hey

[Verse 1]
Everybody keeps on talking about it, nobody's getting it done
Everybody keeps on talking about it, nobody's getting it done
I'm tired-tired-tired now of listening-listening, knowing that this shit's gotta run
I'm tired-tired-tired now of listening-listening, knowing that the shit's gotta run
So

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Everybody keeps on pushing and shoving nobody's, g-got the guts
Everybody keeps on pushing and shoving nobody's, got-got the guts
Everybody keeps on pushing and shoving nobody's, g-got the guts
You'll be tired-tired-tired of letting me in, I never act like I should

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Everybody keeps on listening in, nobody listening up
Everybody keeps on listening in, nobody's listening up
We've been try-try-trying now to let you in, and you just stay-stay there like they look
Everybody keeps on talking about it, nobody's getting it done
Everybody keeps on talking about it, nobody's getting it done
I'm getting tired-tired-tired now of listening-listening, knowing that this shit's gotta run
Shit's gotta run!

I outweigh yours, pick the scale up
Married to the game, pick the veil up

Kiss the game goodbye y'all dry
I Mr. Potatoe head to you small fries
Yeah, you could check my archives
And they nickname my swagga "sharp knives"
Ha ha, first name I thoughts wise
Last name Carter to rappers I'm Jaws five

Ground Control to Major Tom
Ground Control to Major Tom
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on
(Ten) Ground Control (Nine) to Major Tom (Eight, seven)
(Six) Commencing (Five) countdown, engines on
(Four, three, two)
Check ignition (One) and may God's love (Lift off) be with you

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
This is Ground Control to Major Tom
You've really made the grade
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare
This is Major Tom to Ground Control
I'm stepping through the door
And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today

[Chorus]
For here am I sitting in my tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much
She knows
Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you-

[Chorus]
-Here am I floating 'round my tin can
Far above the moon
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

[Instrumental Outro]

[Intro: Siri]
Hi, I'm looking for Molly
I've been searching everywhere

[Chorus: Siri]
And I can't seem to find
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly
(Fucked around and fell in love with her)

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Bands all in my dollars
I'm everywhere its poppin'
Can't fall in love I got options
I'm high school that's college
King Gold Chains, that's Notre Dame
That green, yeah I got it
I show up in the party
Like where the fuck that molly
O-D we're O-G's
We don't fuck with no police
I'm too fly to be low key
Them 24 inch Kobes
All black that's Jodeci
She gimme pussy that's Josie
Broke niggas stop beggin' me
Cause that's the shit that I don't need
I'm swervin', I'm drivin'
Ain't got time to be tired
I'm super turnt, don't try me
Killin' yo mind off and fuckin' yo body
Bitch wanna flick, pose for my posse
Got too much shit to worry about gossip
I'm on a bad trip

[Chorus: Siri]
And I can't seem to find
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly
(Fucked around and fell in love with her)

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Lil' bitch, my section is important
My new car's imported
My bank account is enormous
Weed so loud it's distorted
Got champagne and we pourin' it
She poppin' it and she snortin' it
My iPhone recordin' it, if I want it, I can afford it
Bitch I'm Young Khalifa, fillin' my lungs with reefer
Somewhere in the clouds, gotta press up to see us
I gotta whip so fast that I caught a ticket speedin'
And my bitch so bad that I'm never ever cheatin'
I might pull up in some shit that you've never ever seen
And if I said how much I made, then you won't even believe it
Me and T-Y gettin' gnarly when we pull up to the party
Brought a whole pound of Mary

[Chorus: Siri]
And I can't seem to find
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly
(Fucked around and fell in love with her)

[Verse 3: Mally Mall]
Put it in my drink, put it in my drink
Put it in my drink, you already know
Put it in my drink, put it in my drink
Put it in my drink, you already know
She had me smokin', had me smokin'
Smokin' on my reefer
She had me smokin', had me smokin'
Smokin' on my reefer

[Chorus: Siri]
And I can't seem to find
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly
Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly
(Fucked around and fell in love with her)

[Verse 1]
Home, home in the late night
And away, away in the half light
Except today, crushed by the boring
Until played and plagued by the tourists again
When once you had believed it
Now, you see it's sucking you in
To string you along with the pretense
And pave the way for the coming release

[Verse 2]
Alone and prone in the half light
And late, late to your real life
If you find a way into the gold rush
You will stay until the morning comes

[Refrain]
You can normalize, don't it make you feel alive?
You can normalize, don't it make you feel alive?
You can normalize, don't it make you feel alive?
You can normalize, don't it make you feel alive?
You can normalize, don't it make you feel alive?
You can normalize, don't it make you feel alive?
You can normalize, don't it make you feel alive?
You can normalize, don't it make you feel alive?

[Outro]
Get innocuous

[Intro]
2009 Action Bronson
Hey yo, you know we creeping on the come up
Outdoorsman shit, here we go

[Verse 1]
I've seen a fiend scrape the residue and sniff it off a razor
After party for politicians with loafers and a blazer
Skipping AAA I'm coasting straight up to the majors
Linen in every seat drinking wine and eating capers, square
Holding the ground prep the animal for sacrifice
Rub the body with plenty garlic and a classic spice
Holy Trinity, peppers onions celery
Every time I rap I'm on the verge to catch a felony
Standing in circles with my brothers puffin' product
Disturbers to the public call the coppers blew the spot up
Pulled us over a couple of 50's in the ankle socks
Most of it powder so it looks just like his ankle lock
I got the rap shit in the ankle lock
I got her screaming for submission trying to be up in the bank a lot
Currency’s the only logic, brother bag the work
Come up funny, I leave you open like a faggot's shirt
Hey yo, you know we creeping on the come up
Action Bronson 2009 shit
Hey yo, you know we creeping on the come up

[Verse 2]
You know the saga, knee length coat made of llama
Purple in the Parma, two ki's the Grana Padano
That’s for the cuisine, stracciatell Siciliana
Boom fakers be gettin' vapor dog you get with Anna
The wild fumes, beauty that the ground blooms
Ass fucking the diva leave her with the brown moon
It's now June, tops get lowered off of whips
Flower flip, we grow the mushrooms out the cattle shit
Peddle shiftin' with my eyes closed I'm feeling great
Fire kissing the roasted salmon on the cedar plank
Peep the plan get the money out the bordello
Five-seven the fattest ass, shorty played the cello
Charge a thousand for fifteen, the white collars
Got the manuva serving knowledge for the pipe scholars
Peace to Queens, she the queen of the life
Eating Pio Pio chicken, smothered beans in the rice
And we out

[Outro]
You know we creeping on the come up
You know we creeping on the come up

[Chorus 1]
It's time to get away
It's time to get away from you
It's time to get away
It's time to get away from you

[Verse 1]
You brought a lot of money
But me, I'm catching tiny tummy
And you, you make me sleep
I try and try
But you undermine me, uh-huh
And I start to be sensible
If you know what I mean

[Chorus 2]
And so it's time to get away
It's time to get away from you
I'm dying to get away
I'm dying to get away

[Post-Chorus 1]
And next time, we'll talk it over
And we can start again, shock

[Verse 2]
For you, I caught a lot of static
And me, I would like it automatic
What, what, what, what
What did you think would happen next?
What, what, what, what
What could it ever be?

[Chorus 2]
So it's time to get away
It's time to get away from you
I'm dying to get away
I'm dying to get away

[Post-Chorus 1]
And next time, let's talk about it
Or maybe start again, shock

[Bridge]
To think I used to pity you
To think I used to pity you, it's true
To think I used to pity you
To think I used to talk to you, it's true

[Post-Chorus 2]
Next time we could talk about it
Or even start again
I couldn't tell you what you wanted
You know what I'm saying?
I knew you were low, man
But the truth is, I was shocked

[Outro]
Fun, power, eyes
Eyes never lie
Kids ("Hey, buddy?" "What?")
Kids never lie

[Verse 1]
Trying to do me, no I'm not concerned with you
Shutterbugs attack him walking through the terminal
Out the door and then I hop in the convertible
Light the Earth, like the sun, stars and moon would do
Undefeated like I'm Shula's group
Take a payoff like I'm shoe less soon to see me in the coolest suit
Crew astute, knowledge like a physicist
Secretly a Russian spy twisted by the pyramids
Is it my fault they feel me, more than they feel you?
And seems nobody does it like I do it, keep it real dude
I'm not religious feel like God given ability
Just play your part because your words hold no validity
I'm on a beach, lay oysters on the half shell
Words are like a canvas laced with oil color pastel
I'm in the world strong known to make the Southern moves
Cause every man is for themselves like Royal Rumble rules
(Grunts) They say Bronson got an ego, acting like he Regal
Thought he was my people, just let him go with his ego he on the road kid
Smoking weed to the neck, mother fuck him
Can't hold a mother fuckers hand no more
Done kid, it's just me
Me and my ego on the trip
Fuck you bitch! Suck my dick!
Bronsolino

[Verse 1]
As I roll the weed up, crack a brew and pull the seat up
Got doulas do the maneuver, so daddy putting his feet up
I'm multi-talented, my worth is more than music
Make the truth sticks, Bronsolini I'm on that smooth shit
Perfect posture when I'm standing in the valley
The artichokes are roasted to perfection like Batali, dude
Peace to my people and the groupies let me jam the coochi
Tropical island destinations hopping out the coupé
My flow is Sexual Chocolate not outta Jackson Heights
But out of Flushing where we hitting hard like Quinton Jackson fights
Been on the rampage, you motha fuckas half as nice
Verbally jig you with the banger then I pass the knife
Right to my man because he always in position
To split you like it's division, deliver with the precsion
Of Eleven weapons posing by as Heaven beckons
You on that escalator up in under seven seconds

[Hook]
Yo why my marijuana always thinking crime shit?
Cause lambs delicious with the '87 wine dig
The whip feel good, we're shifting with the left hand
The leather glove and loafer matching with the vest and
I'm on a mission for dollars and I'm a dreamer
Doing drugs and fucking bitches with bottles inside the steamer
It's hard not to form a habit I'm getting twisted in the yard
Eating foreign rabbits, I'm on that next Shit
Damn
Mad late
My fucking hernias popping out of my stomach and shit

[Verse]
Yo
She bent over in a mirror taking pictures
Crew a bunch of dykes and some Puerto Rican strippers
From Ridgewood she did her thing just like a bitch should
But in the morning started burning, I can't piss good
I cleared that up though
Diver’s scallops, sear ‘em
Seven grams of fuzzy in the palm’ll be the serum
The Rocketeer, out in Switzerland we poppin’ there
Mulatto babies cause you know your boy's a chocolatier
Haze galore, going Asian on the carpet
Artichokes and lamb
From the land not from the market
Blunts rolled consecutively
Who every really thought this motha fucka destined to be?
This type of style on the mic
Get razzled, dazzled
Stretch you like pilate
Penetrate your flower then I split
Karate
The shotty Hollywood, I gave the bitch a nosejob
And fuck a new Benz I'd rather cop the old Saab
Velour down short set paired with the cream joints
Wine, I always swirl it and smell it
Make an esteemed choice
My cheese sauce always known to keep a fiend moist
I swear my words’ll have me hopping out the green Royce
Rolls and blunted, crispy chicken, aged cheddar
Lonnie got a block of cheese, no it ain't feta
The semi-soft flow master with the hemi-talk
I'm higher than the motha fuckas at the heliport
Bronsolini Bronsolafski Bronsolinio

[Chorus]
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
I get all confused when you mix up the dates (Woo!)

[Verse 1]
Don't gimme the pretend, you come for the weekend
And you stay for the week
You say that you hate it, but that's how you made it
Just to keep it oblique
We're both high, high, high
High, high on lemon sips
We're all su-su-su—
Sucked in by parlour tricks

[Verse 2]
Oh, the people deceive you, the kids never leave
'Cause you make them at home
You try to appease them and they show you the stick
But still, you pick up the phone
But hey, man, you can take it
As long as they don't shove you out in the cold
It's not getting better, no, it's not getting better, man
It's just getting old
And ah-ooh! We do what we're programmed to do
Hey, we do what we're told
Ah-woo-hoo!

[Verse 3]
I never remember to carry my book
When I get on the bus
You never forget, but it's your time to pay up
When they are making a fuss
We're both high-high-high
High-high on lemon sips
We're all high-high-high
High-high on wiggling hips
And ah-ooh! You break off your plans for the weekend
And ah-ooh! You can tell them the dates
But that don't mean they're letting you go
Ah-woo-hoo! Go!
Ah-woo-hoo!

[Verse 4]
Don't gimme the pretend, you come for the weekend
And you stay for the year
Avoid all your plans 'cause we're making our day jobs
Into a steady career
We're both high-high-high
High-high on lemon sips
We all claw, claw, claw, claw
Climb on to sinking ships
And ah-ooh! Avoid all the cold sideways glances
And ah-ooh! Celebrate, celebrate, celebrate
And then turn to stone

[Chorus]
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
You, you turn 25 and now you're all out of escapes, c'mon

[Bridge]
Hey, the rock writer told me to tell you:
"Though you're great and you're brave
You still lack that which makes you a star"

[Chorus]
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
Read all the pamphlets and watch the tapes
We all get a little drunk and then we act like apes
Ow!

[Sample: Sin City]
And when I find out who did it, it won't be quick and quiet like it was with you
It'll be loud and nasty. My kind of kill
And when his eyes go dead the hell I send him to will seem like heaven after what I've done to him

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Yo
Time on my hands
Running fast like Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Hit the Jackie Rob
Cop the Hershey
Spark the bark for the ride back to the Galaxy
Back, back, down, forward, kick
That's a fatality
For Liu Kang, turn to a dragon then a raven
Ain't no professor that can fuck with this verbatim
Your style is prenatal
I got the hand that rock the cradle
Fully auto mac under the table
Jewish platters, kreplach soups and sable
If you ain't stable, don't hang around cause I enable
Drug use, dick sucks from a fiend
Rib eye steaks that still on a bone
Me and my team shine
Like hologram fishscale right off the Greek coast
Toast to greats with bubbles
Three states, three cases, no traces
I'm the ace to shovels
So sick, muthafucka cover face with muzzles (Yeah!)
Flushing, Queens, twenty seven years strong
Where you think you're gonna run to when the tears gone
And reality set just like the sun do
Ain't trying to have my babies raised up in the slum, true!

[Sample: Sin City]
C'mon, you son of a bitch
Damn, he's slick

[Verse 2: Meyhem Lauren]
No love for snitch niggas trying to serenade the precinct
Singing about granulated onions that ain't used for seasoning
My mind is off, this life gave me a different type of reasoning
I'm so New York that I could rep it from a different region
Slay heffers, Ottomanelli's got 'em in telly's
We eat good, Turkish cuisine, Ottoman belly's
We sit in whips and our whips sit on Pirelli's
While we're getting dick sucks, my whole team is Akinyele's
Put in their mouth, let 'em give 'em second chances
I'm known for finger banging bitches giving table dances
Open my flip book, see me posted in the sickest stances
Glorious garments, you could get some style by taking glances
Red snapper, taken apart, put back together
Plated on some bok choy, fine fish platters forever (Yo!)
Same routine, another day, a new endeavor
I usually rock a power piece under a Polo leather

[Verse 3: Shaz Illyork]
I write left, think right, need the box tight
Mind blowing dome cause I always eat the box right
Make believers out of haters, haters out of homies
Bring my fam to the top so I ain't lonely
I'm with the team, cuisine like we celebrating
Contemplate the takeover when we delegating
Get it shaking like a dancer at Perfections
Catch us in a European coupe, it's never rented, kid
Been getting it, circle full of amateurs
See great rappers smoking seeded up cannabis
Fucking embarrassment, we cooler than a Vick's rub
You the type to trick it all night at a strip club
I'm the type to bag a stripper out front
Take her back, line a twenty up and get my shit sucked (Yeah!)
That's what you do when you flyer than Goldblum
Purple label loafers, paying homage to the old school

[Verse 4: AG Da Coroner]
I'm from Brooklyn, the reason why I walk with a bop
Same reason I don't fuck with the cops
My borough is thorough, if any nigga try to tell me it's not
I'll leave his face bloodied up, all covered in knots
We break bread at the table with made niggas and sip wine
And graduate from little niggas, now we living big time
I'm in a state of mind like Nas in his prime
That real New York talk, home of gritty and grime
Check it, I got the cleanup, Bronsonelli's batting leadoff
Your mother's mouth is the place where I drop my seeds off
Hop in the Lamborghini, middle finger speed off
D's are getting P'd off, they're present, drop the weed off
I'm like a cross between Stoudemire and Carmelo
Half these New York whack rappers are soft as Jell-O
Since a little nigga, always been a fly fellow
Went from dark brown skin into a high yellow

[Intro: Punch & Kendrick Lamar]
C4, K.Dot, let's get it
Yeah, Punch wanted me to come right in on the one
I didn't want to
I love this beat
I love it so much, I can just listen to the instrumental
And don't rap
But I won't do that

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Light an incense for little Kendrick, little, oh, Kendrick
Determination, my drive is like a thousand convertible engines
My adrenaline pump the blood of a warrior, chump, the apprentice
Grown to be a man, 21 now, my heart in my hand
Don’t get gunned down, I’m from Compton, bitch
Fuck a 6-4, we hit the kill switch
The other day I seen my nigga Snows in the casket
Darker skin tone, you can only imagine
The type of shit we on, murdered them dumb bastards
Kill 'em inside their kitchen
And then stuffed them inside their cabinets
Death before dishonor, put that on my mama
I'mma ride till I see the promise land, that’s a promise
Llamas in the unfamiliar minivan
More drama only make more problems, but

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
They gotta get shot down
'Cause we riding, we riding, we riding
They gotta get shot down
'Cause we riding, we riding

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Like a black rodeo, .44’s, calicos
Chop 'em up, stop 'em up like a stuffy nose
We supposed to be brothers, motherfuck ya
Tuck your tail, bitch, hell is waiting on ya
While I’m praying on ya
Not on my knees though, I mean preying on ya
I gotta feed, ho, and your death is nutritious to my appetite
After I eat, you’re sure to see afterlife
Jesus Christ, forgive me for my sins
Because when you forgive me, I’m sure to sin again
I guess I’m a sinner, especially when I found out somebody killed my nigga
Nigga, does anybody killer, fuck your creed, race, or color
Son, daughter, sister, mother, brother gotta suffer
Bitch, I’m cold hearted, till my arteries freeze
Please hand me the keys to the G-ride
They outside then

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
They gotta get shot down
'Cause we riding, we riding, we riding
They gotta get shot down
'Cause we riding, we riding

[Verse 3: Punch with Kendrick Lamar]
Somebody get ready for a murder
No more further announcements
Mac-11 bouncing, the murder scene, coroner, yellow tape surrounding
Either I retaliate or find self counseling
Somebody got to die, simple mathematics
Semi-automatic, watch them niggas panic and their hearts perish
Or let's be diplomatic and less melodramatic
Everything is vanity, think Ecclesiastic
But what’s it all for, or what’s it all mean?
An eye for an eye means you and I won’t live to see
As our hearts bleed, we proceed cautiously
Shoot them niggas down consciously, that’s how

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
They gotta get shot down
'Cause we riding, we riding, we riding
They gotta get shot down
'Cause we riding, we riding

[Hook]

Hey, I've killed careers in my years
And you not even good as these niggas
Catch me in the hood with these niggas

Pull up at the club, 'bout fifteen niggas
Everybody got a gun and a hustle gang sweater

"Where's the fucking money, shitheaddddddddd???!!!"

[Action Bronson]

Yo, fucking Paulie TRYBE, man
Get your muthafucking hand out her asshole
We gotta go, fam, we gotta go, kid
Yo, get the whip, get the whip!

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]

I'll take 21st Century poets that's for a thousand
Curly hair or Nubian women get me aroused
To the point I wanna gamble it all
I was smashing from the back
She put her hands on the wall
She couldn't take the thrust
Only lust like a fiend for the dust
Or the pizza from Pezzi, perfect
Want to sleep with the crust
Or the 740 Alpina, leather seats is a must
And my shorty holding a nina
Rolling green in a duuuuuuuuuutch!
Bronsolini, organically I rise to paper
In the purest form, lyrically derived from nature
Like the Amazon, put your cameras on
Watch this muthafucka turn into an animal!
Light stubble, rock the muzzle like Hannibal
Jump off the top of the boat into a cannonball
Hoes with gold teeth, we off the coast of Greece
In under 3 seconds, muthafucka load the piece
Kid, the bag of money coming with me
You muthafucka
The bag of money coming with me
Yeah, the bag of money's coming with me
Muthafucka you

[Verse 2: Meyhem Lauren]

Surprise! Lauren is in the house
I eat fowl birds and keep a hen inside my mouth
Always extra, guest featuring with Dr. Lecter
Like Bald Head Slick, I hold my mic like a scepter
Rest in peace, Guru, son I rep Q-U
Chains on chunk
They looking at me like "who you?!"
These handmade Cubans probably fucking up my posture
Pesto sauce properly drizzled upon my pasta
No imposter, son I'm authentic
Around drugs so much, I'm probably raw scented
Bag of money dips, triceps is all dented
Precise painting pictures
Think about life and then I pen it
Nike Air extraordinaire, it’s a cold world, prepare
That’s what it is, dad
Winterize your vehicle
I love kicks like Action Bronson loves a reefer pull
Peace to good, bad girls that let us both sleep with you
The bag of bitches coming with me
Word up, son, all the bitches coming with me
Yeah, yo, the bag of bitches coming with me
We go raw son, all the bitches coming with me!

We making babies tonight, nigga
Yeah, smoke what you want, sniff what you want
You wanna have five daddies, you ever have five daddies before?

[Verse 3: Action Bronson]

Ayo, 2010, got ‘em buzzing like a beeper
Round table discussion
Conference in Geneva
Leaders at the table, poly over nasal
Forty seven minutes since the time I lit the basil
My rhymes are carte blanche
Liver than the Oscars
Extra virgin olive oil drizzled on the pasta
Fry the bacon, make it sizzle for the chazers
Honor in this thing of ours
Living like the mobsters
Compliments go to the chef and that’s the real
My crew of goonies in the joint
We need some extra veal
You know the Caddy got an extra wheel
And if I’m ever in a pickle, I can hand a fucking Tek to Steele
Take aim and knock an apple off your head
And I’m a play like Polamalu
You get tackled for the bread
We’re running in your crib
Your shorty shackled to the bed
Money laying on the Persian
Leaking plasma from the lead
And it’s on!

[Outro: Action Bronson & Meyhem Lauren]

The bag of money’s coming with me, muthafucka
(It’s all coming with us, nahimean?
Outdoorsmen!)
Queens, kid, the bag of money’s coming with me
Uptown connection, you fucking pussy
(Word up, man, It’s all marvel
Ya’ll niggas know everything is marvel)
Bronsonlini, Bronsolovski, Team Facelift
(Everything we drink, everything we smoke
Everything we buy, everything we sell
It’s all marvel!)
My muthafucking man Shaz
Paulie TRYBE, Paulie Walnuts
(Action Marvel, Meyhem Marvel, nahimean?)
Machine, Fonda, Tommy Guns
(Tommy Marvel, Marvel is everybody’s middle name we fuck with
Meyhem Marvel Lauren, it’s all marvel
The bag of money’s coming with us)

[Hook: Swizz Beats]
Money, cars, clothes, hoes

Damn I hate a old fake ass nigga
Thats why you only see me with some ape ass niggas

New Orleans landlord where yo gate pass nigga
Like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5-0-4 yeah
Pussy ass niggas don't survive no mo
And the niggas say they riders
Ain't riders no mo
From the deep part of the water where the divers won't go
Hey sharks, sup piranhas
Them boys catfish, them boys flounders
I pop on roll, I roll around ya
Hit ya with that 2-2 7 times like Casandra
Fucking with my...

[Hook: Swizz Beats]
Money, cars, clothes, hoes

[Verse 2: T-Streetz]
Fuck, what the fuck I look like
Fuck my verse, nigga
Swizz got the hook right
Angel in the kitchen with the beat and it's cooked right
Weezy be the crack in the jar and he shook right
And I'm the nigga standin over the stove
With a good price with a bitch that ride dick dry bricks and books flights
Drive bricks an book flights
Good by bad days, hello good nights
No my coke look like Carmelo?
Sittin in lebrons, driver seat reclined
2 woman, my mary j disc and my 9
It's my life, my life, my mutha fuckin life
And fuck one time it's...

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I murder that boy, I kill that bitch
Straight burn ya body up like a skillet bitch
I turn beef to me meyou, be my fil-let bitch
And ya stomach ain't gotta hurt for you to feel dat shit
So ain't no love for no otha so say I fuck them tricks
Ain't no loves flyin now besides birds of them bricks
Unless you talkin bout eagle dats the street I know
A person on pro tools couldn't see my flow
I clap a nigga 3 times, like the 3 syllables
Word that I know, called holly grove
Nigga fuck your money, clothes, cars, hoes
Kids, friends, and foes, and you and then I get back to the...

[Hook]

[Verse: 1]
Come on out
Since when did you
Stop leaving your house?
You don't seem sure
What you want to happen now

Are you having fun?
(Am I having fun?)
Can you have some fun?
(I wanna go home now)

You'll see me when I go back
I know it won't be hard

[Hook]
Can't tell you how I know
This is where I want you to
Take me when I die and I'm full of sleep
Underneath the pine on a bed of leaves
Sorry if I pass you by
I never saw into your eyes
I was only thinking of my home
And how it's so far

[Verse: 2]
Get away
Since you don't know
How to be yourself
You don't seem sure
What you want to happen now

Can you leave us now?
(I'm gonna leave you now)
Alright I'll go
(Alright I'll go)

[Hook]
Can't tell you how I know
This is where I want you to
Take me when I die and I'm full of sleep
Underneath the pine on a bed of leaves

Sorry if I pass you by
I never saw into your eyes
I was only thinking of my home
And how it's so far

[Intro]
Yes, you should be afraid
Yes, you should be afraid, baby

They in the bushes, look in the trees
They got they red laser sniper rifles stuck on me
Creepin' up slow, ducking down real low
They gonna huff and puff and knock down the door
Come on now

[Chorus]
Well, let's get it started
Load the gun, light the fuse
I'm coming for you, baby
I got to stand and fight
I'm locked and loaded now, I'm heavily armed

I got that, an angel on each arm, baby
Alright now
You know I got that one on my left, come on
One on my right, alright
They protect me every day and every night
I got that

[Verse 2]
I saw it so clear, two hearts flying in my mirror
Then I knew good things were gonna come, now
A fortune teller, she read my palm
She said hard times will soon be over
Good times will come

[Chorus]
Well, let's get it started
Load the gun, light the fuse
I'm coming for you, baby
I got to stand and fight
I'm locked and loaded now, heavily armed

Don't try to stop me

I got an angel on each arm, yeah, alright, yeah
An angel on each arm, baby, alright now
You know I got that one, one on my left, come on
One on my right, alright
They protect me every day and every night
Bring it on, baby

That's what I came here to say
But if I was wrong, then I'm sorry

But life is for living, we all know
And I don't want to live it alone

[Chorus]
Sing
Ah, ah, oh
Sing
Ah, ah, oh
And just sing
Ah, ah, oh

Cuz I don't need no homeland
Security, my own man

Let it splash on 'em
Bang this, I ain't pay shit
You spent your last on 'em
(Yeah ho) $1000 jeans, call them Balmain
(Yeah ho) Life is so ghetto fab, call me Paul Cain
That's the reason why I'm with her
These other bitches bitter
I'm the quickest picker-upper
I will hit her then I'll quit her
Then I give her to my niggas
I'm no kidder, split her kitty litter
Finger in her shitter
Then forget her like we never did her
Reality, she sweatin' me
Her fantasy is sexin' me

Snowin', blowin'
Frozen, coke land, snowman
My business ain't the only thing her nose in
Went from ex-pretty boy crook slash dope man
To handin' out hundred dollar bills to the doorman
Now somebody please let the hoes in
Now somebody please let my bros in
Boy, you won't believe how my foes end?
Overnight celebrities, they party 'til the show ends

[Hook]
Don't get too close, too close

Honey, you're my golden star
You know you can make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you
If you let me treasure you

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa-oh-oh-h-h-h

[Verse 2]
Pretty girl, pretty girl, pretty girl, you should be smiling
(You should be smiling)
A girl like you should never look so blue
You're everything I see in my dreams
I wouldn't say that to you if it wasn't true

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, whoa-oh-oh
I know that you don't know it, but you're fine, so fine
(Fine, so fine)
Oh, whoa-oh-oh

[Intro]
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh

Whoa, oh

[Verse 1]
Now listen to me, baby
Before I love and leave you
They call me heartbreaker
I don't wanna deceive you

[Pre-Chorus]
If you fall for me
I'm not easy to please
I might tear you apart
Told you from the start, baby, from the start

[Chorus]
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart

[Verse 2]
There's no point trying to hide it
No point trying to evade it
I know I got a problem
Problem with misbehavin'

[Pre-Chorus]
If you fall for me
I'm not easy to please
I might tear you apart
Told you from the start, baby, from the start

[Chorus]
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa, oh

[Bridge]
And I know karma's gonna get me back for being so cold
Like a big bad wolf, I'm born to be bad and bad to the bone
If you fall for me, I'm only gonna tear you apart
Told you from the start

[Chorus]
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart

[Intro: Timbaland]
Dance all (night)
I said dance all (night)

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
Hey baby girl: Looking all done up
I wanna know: Where did you come from?
The heat begin to raise... Hot woman
The club about to go into flames... Baby, speakers thumping
Let's party hard, and just move something
The vibe is right and it goes, goes, goes, goes something like this:

[Hook: Timbaland]
Such a beautiful crowd...
The levels on 10...
People standing on chairs with their hands up in the air
Girls getting real wild...
Hair blowing in the wind...
Girls standing on the chairs with their hands up in the air

[Chorus]
...With their hands up in the air...
...With their hands up in the air...
...With their hands up in the air...
...With their hands up in the air...
...With their hands up in the air...
...With their hands up in the air...
...With their hands up in the air...
...With their hands up in the air...

[Verse 2: Ne-Yo]
High heels, standing on them soft couch cushions
Careful, not to break her concentration
Maintain sexy as she maintains balance (balance)
If you fall, baby girl it won't be cute at all (at all)
Drink in your left hand (left hand)
Girlfriend in your right (your right)
On the couch dancing (dancing)
Holding on for dear life (life)
Thump of the music (plus!)
The flash of the light (plus!)
Long legs and a short skirt equal one hell of a night!
Know what I'm talking about?

[Hook]

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Timbaland & Ne-Yo]
Uh, hands in the air
Uh, hands in the air
I got my eyes closed!
Jumping up and down, baby I'm on ten
I got my eyes closed!
Listen to the sounds, so hypnotizing (Hey!)
And I bet before the night ends (Hey!)
I'm going to find one that I'm liking
Take her home, get it on next morning
Baby girl, give me that one more gin before you go
(I got my hands in the air) I got my eyes closed
(I got my hands in the air) I got my eyes closed
(I got my hands in the air) I got my eyes closed
(I got my hands in the air)
My hands, my hands, in the air, in the air...

[Hook]

Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team fuckin' here

[Verse 1]
I done kept it real from the jump
Livin' at my momma's house, we'd argue every month
Nigga, I was tryna get it on my own
Workin' all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle callin' me, like, "Where you at?
I gave you the keys, told you bring it right back”
Nigga, I just think it's funny how it goes
Now I'm on the road, half a million for a show, and we—

[Chorus]
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team fuckin' here
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team fuckin' here
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga

[Verse 2]
Boys tell stories 'bout the man
Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah, I doubt it
Nigga, I could turn your boy into the man
There ain't really much out here that's poppin' off without us
Nigga, we just want the credit where it's due
I'ma worry 'bout me, give a fuck about you
Nigga, just as a reminder to myself
I wear every single chain, even when I'm in the house
'Cause we—

[Chorus]
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team fuckin' here
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga

[Bridge]
No new niggas, nigga, we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where your real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explainin'
Story stayed the same, I never changed it
No new niggas, nigga, we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where your real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explainin'
Story stayed the same through the money and the fame
'Cause we—

[Chorus]
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team fuckin' here
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now my whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom, now we're here
Started from the bottom, now the whole team here, nigga

[Produced by Mike Zombie]
Orpheus can never look back at the real woman trailing behind him out of hell, the woman that anybody could see with ordinary eyes. Orpheus must keep his eyes firmly fixed on the imaginal Eurydice before him, towards whom he has struggled all his life. She is not imaginary, not at all, but realer than any mere apparency, than any momentary act of seeing. He must move always towards that perfect image of his wife, and so sustain himself and his song. If ever he turns back, that is, regresses into seeing his wife as an ordinary woman, she is lost. And he is lost.

[Intro/Sample: Macho Man Randy Savage & Arsenio Hall]

I'm the Tower of Power
Too sweet to be sour
I'm funky like a monkey
Sky is the limit
And space is the place

Hello!

[Verse 1]

Yo, as the clouds shift over and cover half of the moon up
The smoke leave my lungs
That's my jam, turn the tunes up
2nd Avenue, cruising in a beamer
Holding ninas, my feets are featured in a Fila shoe
Time to get mine, never see me standing in a breadline
Never bedtime cause I'm a headline
From here to Portugal, kick it like Ronaldo
Mustache like Geraldo
Let the money pile, ho
Yay high
I'm on fire like a gay guy
But pause that
Raw rap, break your thorax
Long, White dick inserted in your whore's back
I'm fucking hookers straight from Kazakhstan- Borat

[Midtro/Sample: "Macho Man" Randy Savage]

I'm a Chameleon, yeah, huh uh
Chameleon?
Uh Huh!, yeah!
I'm talking about the beat goes on, yeah
And the beat goes on, yeah
And the beat goes on

[Verse 2]

I smell the ocean cause I'm near the coast
Queens breakfast
In the streets you could hear the toast pop
Probably over some butter
In a penthouse, but I rose from the gutter
Where's my money?
Cut a finger, send it home to your mother
Bring your visors back
Skin fades, beards with Giambi lenses
Big Walkmans, yellow ones, the Sports shit
Bow to my portrait
Thousands of horses
That laid under the hood that's in the back of the Porsche
War stories from my people that survived 'em
Bitches sucking dick that's on arrival
Paralyze your spinal cord
For smoking drugs, I'm on the honor roll
Don't get arrested
Stuffed the rest in her punana hole
This shit is wunderbar
Hard top, 740 German
'94, copping soccer cleats out of Herman's
Laying in the grass
Out the basket, eating grapes
Shorty throwing signs that she wet below the waist
Swinging like beyond wall, geishas in the corner
Bronson like a spy, giving facials in the sauna
Snap my fingers, waiters come
Smoking with the lazy lung
Every kind of drug is on deck like a Navy gun
War stance, one call will make a broad dance
And then the pussy coming right up out your whore's pants
No romance, it's straight brutal
Body sumo, biting bitches like I'm Cujo
The lane switcher, the grain gripper
The soft, leather seat sitter
Head while I'm on the shitter
Bette Midler
Flushing, Queens death spitter
Donnie Baseball, standing on the left hitter

[Outro/Sample: Macho Man Randy Savage]

Macho Man is right now
So sweet as honey
Macho Man is on a roll and he can't be stopped, no
Elizabeth understands what I'm talking about, yeah
Uh huh!
I don’t fuck with nobody, about me
I don’t fuck with nobody, about me
I don’t fuck with nobody, about me
I don’t fuck with nobody, about me
I don’t fuck with nobody…

[Hook]
These bitches love T-Raww
Hatin,’ need machine guns
All these niggas they broke boys
And I push a Rolls Royce
Niggas they don’t like me
I heard niggas they don’t like me
Man these bitches love T-Raww
Only trust my Nina
King shit with my feet up
Kill a nigga with my song, but
Niggas they don’t like me
I heard niggas they don’t like me
Man these bitches love T-Raww

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Ridin’ ‘round no plates
Schemin’ tryin’ to get paid
Lookin’ for a fuck date
Men lie, women lie
But not the numbers I make
Load up that Wild Boy
Call it MGK
Mind gone, don’t fuck with me
Countin’ dorms in the Middle East
38, Silence of the Lambs
Hello Clarice
My life need a DVD
Bags of money like the Money Team
Dress bitches in all black
You could call them BET
These hoes in competition
Competing for a seat in VIP
These niggas claimin’ they poppin’ bottles
They just holdin’ that sparkle thing
Wrist on, I had a dream
Martin Luther I must’ve seen
Mixtape, mix ya body with tape
That’s what that green’ll bring

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Off season, no time to play
Night time, my time of day
I hustle hard like Ace and Wayne
Two shifts, I’mma need a raise
Carpool, stay in your lane
I’m blowin’ up, that’s propane
These hoes want my last name
No sitcom, this the House of Pain
No I don’t fuck with nobody like celibates
I ride alone, I die alone
She give me head, that’s Tylenol
No dialogue, she play her part
My life a movie, no script at all
I darn say that I did it all, I did it all, so…

[Hook]
Instru 1

And I've got the drop top you see me driving through

Pots and pans when I do my dance see my pants they come from France
Bitches wanna go on dates, if they broke they ain't got no chance

Talkin' bout I’m switch hittin', talkin' 'bout I'm mainstream

Made dreams come true though and I’m high on Pluto
And I got a foreign car it only came with like two doors
And got niggas dead broke career kudos
I don’t give a fuck but this shit right here my new flow
My old flow you stole that, old shit that’s throwback
Fuck that I got the white cap on black hoodie and a skull cap in
Bitches know better fall back, ball bat to your head
Crack that leave you dead heard what I said

This is off the top, Whatever you got
Jiggy cause I'm pretty boy

Fuck that shit we got this weed up and you can't be rollin'

Harlem nigga never stutter word to my mother
And you rich bout to keep it gutter in a butter never butter
Never stutter never nervous
Runnin' from the cops, drunk as fuck and I'm swervin'
And I got a permit, I ain't got no license
And I wrap the game tight, you can call it vice grips
And you know your biceps get hit with that tech if you talk
Respect it you better respect, Protect Ya Neck that Wu-Tang shit
Niggas gettin' throwed for the twenty thirteen on the scene
A$AP ya' mean getting green, green, green, green

Got five for these verses, purple like his shirt is
A$AP up in London town, gotta tell 'em where my turf is
Other rappers is worthless, leave them all in hearses
And I got like 4 long shirt thieves they ain't no shirtses
No curses, fuck that, back on the trap when I spit
Fuck that they can go back on my dick when I come with this classic shit
Cause they bitin' but ain't nobody excited when I write it
So it's off the top if you know the hype is still the heighted

Gotta Hood by Air sweater, this shit is M3
And I'm in a M3 till my nigga Benji's we throwin'

[Hook: Sly]

At first they groove for the underdog

Till, you prove them wrong
Now, you gots to fall
They gots to be the proof 

[go down x8]
You gots to be the proof 

[go down x8]
They gots to be the proof

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]

Niggas is so gangsta, niggas is thugs
Niggas'll spend their whole life peddling drugs
Slanging dope in hopes of one day bein able
To own their own label and give the game up
Some niggas came up, some just didn't
That's just the way it is, if it ain't meant it just isn't
Some niggas'll get money and pay niggas to back em'
So they can act up, feel comfortable, and rap tough
And that's as backwards, cuz them niggas just gone keep coming back
And that's when extortion happens
You struggle to get free, I know how this shit be
You deal with anything to live legitimately
But you gone find if you do get in this industry
It's best to be business me than against me
Niggas get behind mics and ain't even MC's
Niggas get on MTV just to diss me

[Hook: Sly]

[Verse 2: Obie Trice]

They say why don't we increase the peace
The only peace increased is that which deletes your peeps
Cuz iggaz run mouths but they don't run streets
Till that 4 5 will cease the speech
Yeah it's a shame how the beef'll creep
Could've readched the peep, now you're left with a horrible leak
I'm try to be bleak with my speech as possible
Just in case a nigga trying to throw me an obstacle
I put you in a hospital, that's how I get at you
Let the doc op on you, he don't rid you?
You back on the streets? I send another hit at you
This is not a hypocritical issue
I will critical condition your tissue
Give a fuck if all ten of them with you
I throw an extra ten of them missiles
Turn gangstas into gentlemen

[Hook: Sly]

[Intro: DJ Scream]
No relationship
No exchange of phone numbers
No valentine’s day, no Christmas, no dates
Just straight up fucking, you hear me?

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I just had a threesome, could have been a freesome
But I’m not a cheap one so I gave they ass 5 hunda
Skeeted on her bum bum, fucked her with a condom
East Atlanta, known for dragging bitches where I come from
Baby say I’m handsome, 2 hoes that’s a tandem
Bougy bitch she only suck dick when she in the mansion
Yeah my diamonds dancing, my dick taste just like candy
I’m cooking dope in Burberry cause I’m kinda fancy

She talking shit, she got my dick standing hard at attention
She’s a very freaky girl, sucking dick in Gucci Bentley

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I just wanna know some, she just wanna smoke some

[Verse 2: Kirko Bangz]
Ride through the hood, hoes scream my name
When it comes to hoes I'm the fucking maine
Niggas represent that east side, lmg, that’s gang gang
Turn up nigga like a fucking flower
Like a balling bitch, her brother powder
She fall in love with my Oscar Mayer pockets full of that cauliflower
My nigga Waka, got a bitch in Prada, we all hit her, that’s a pinata
I’m never done, but I’m the dundada
Master P, make em say, ugh
Bitch eating up my cum, probably fuck around with her mom

She fuck my team, for front row seats
You tryna fuck so you pussy eat

You pussy niggas can’t smoke with me
Asian bitch, her pussy tight, and all I speak is get on knees

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I just wanna know some, she just wanna smoke some

Nutted on the back seat, back shots, back shots

[Verse 4: Young Scooter]
I just wanna fuck, don’t wanna know your name
4 hoes at one time, I’m on molly not no xans
Freebandz make her dance, got a pistol in my pants
One night stand bitch I can’t hold your hand

In less than 60 seconds I done talked her out her pants

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I just wanna know some, she just wanna smoke some

Gucci wanna fuck some, flocka wanna cut some
This lady is my partner, kirko, any wanna fuck some
Do you wanna fuck some, cause I wanna fuck some
No need to introduce yourself, just follow these instructions

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
Momma gave me the swag, I walk like the President
Talk 'bout only dead presidents and big settlements
Yes, I have faith in the flag, yep, I'm a citizen
I'm repping for my city that is bad as the city is (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)
Momma ain't teach me no better but to get this cheddar
And that I do and for it I get at you
I consider you all fools, you niggas is hilarious
Young Money—bitches don't wanna fuck us, they wanna marry us
Now, ain't that some shit?
I can't have one bitch, but I just got one dick, and no—
I ain't fucking with the fake
I load my handgun with hand towel to touch a nigga face
I am something like a safe, I will never crack
Ain't no combination, nigga, never that
If a nigga ever said anything about Weezy and meant it
He gon' get it that same evening, pimpin'
I'm backseat riding like I'm Mr. Daisy
I am Weezy F. Baby, don't miss the Baby
I kiss the lady on her hand
I'm a fly young man, check my wingspan
This year, I probably do everything tan
Buy a crib on the sand, gotta float to the land, but
Don't get it twisted, I'll still die for me
And do a bid for my man, keep it real as I can
'Cause I'm strong, strong with a will and a plan
Where there's a will, there's a way, so make way for the fam
Young Money—I yell it 'til they come for me, come get me
I bet I'll take more than one with me
I know it don't take more than one shot
And for that reason, I'm gon' shoot more than one shot (Gangsta Gri-Zillz!)
I be clicking when the gun stop, I make the body hot
Then spit on it when the body drop
I get on it like a pot of crack, I get at your bitch
Then, I tell her like a rapper: "Holla back!"
I'm still asking, "Where the dollars at?"
I will smash you if you got 'em Jack, I'll peel faster
The lil' bastard in the Maybach
A young nigga, I still think saving is wack
I eat, sleep, shit, and bathe with my gat
I'm like, "Fuck pimping; slaving is back"
They like, "Yes, master, you the best, master"
My hoes need me, I'm like test answers
You don't need me, you might catch cancer
Come back from treatment looking like Van Axel
No, I don't like baldhead hoes
I like a long-haired diva with the bossiest goals
I'm a all day pleaser, your boy can't go
He too proud, I go where your boy can't go, oh
Nasty ass lil' boy
Put my feet up on the dash, pass the  grass, enjoy
Get the coke up off the glass, get the money out the drawers
Get the weed out the jars, and we do it like stars, haha

[Outro: Lil Wayne & DJ Drama]
Weezy F. Baby
Big shout-out to SHADE 45
The streets is watching
Aphilliates Radio
Turn me up a little bit, man
Just a little
Let me feel the summer breeze in my hair
Whip it, in the convertible
Queens shit
Cruising down Queens Blvd. by the mall
Go to get the Ices, yo

[Verse 1]

School is out, playing ball inside the park
Then the liquor and the weed is introduced after it's dark (uhh)
Playing spades in the back corner
Dick sucks in the crisp air, 'olas in the crisp pair
Of sneakers
That were designed for David Robby
Sleeping on the benches, all with good intentions
To wake up and do the same shit again
Everyday was like a week and it seemed to never end, and
Get the wrench, spray the hydrant in the street
When I seen that special girl, she had me flying on my feet (uhh)
Shirt wet, damn, I'm trying to hurt that
Two girls, one boy, want her to birth that
Years later though, we living in the moment
Caught up in the young love, kissing and the holding
Sharing lo mein, hit the A train to Rockaway
Plus she only lived a block away
Damn I miss her

[Hook 2x]

This summer love happened underneath the boardwalk
Souls in tune so there's never need for small talk
She held my heart, and no, she'd never leave my side
Through the years, through the struggle
Was a thing of pride

[Verse 2]

Slush puppies, cocoa, mango, cherry
Mexicans on Roosevelt
Pounding down the Chevy
Go to 1-6-1, to watch the Yankees play
Years later and I'm dealing with the family court shit
On the same block, pressure make the veins pop
Cop a forty dollar holler out of Bangkok
But I'm in Queens
Diversity the best
Yellow to the chocolate shorty's
Powders on their chest

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 1]
There are barn doors
And there are revolving doors
Doors in the rudders of big ships and there are revolving doors

[Verse 2]
There are doors that open by themselves
There are sliding doors and there are secret doors

[Verse 3]
There are doors that lock and doors that don't
There are doors that let you in and out but never open
And there are trapdoors that you can't come back from

[Intro: Darrelle Revis]
Yo, this your boy Mr. Manhattan. I'ma just keep it like that

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Now the cameras flashin' (Now the cameras flashin')
All eyes on me (All eyes on me)
Yeah, now we gettin' paid so you know we feelin' great
At the club, motherfucker, all drinks are free
The light so bright, I'm feelin' so nice
Girl, we can get right, but just for the night (For the night)
It feel great to be fly like me (Like me)
I bet you wish that you was fly like me (Like me)

[Verse 1: Darrelle Revis]
I got this crazy kinda feelin', Mac
I'm in the 'Burg and the spotlight's on my back
No pressure on my back, I aim high, swag on full attack
Remember back in the days, house party kid and play, that's how we played
You know we got chicks, that's what they laid
Come on, girl, you can't stay?
'Cause it's Friday night, no job and I'm lookin' right
I'ma hit the club, shawty on my neck, back, wrist for what?
It's this groupie love, if it is, that's what's up
If it ain't, that's what's up, I'm chillin' on my grind, pour it up

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Now the cameras flashin' (Now the cameras flashin')
All eyes on me (All eyes on me)
Yeah, now we gettin' paid so you know we feelin' great
At the club, motherfucker, all drinks are free
The light so bright, I'm feelin' so nice
Girl, we can get right, but just for the night (For the night)
It feel great to be fly like me (Like me)
I bet you wish that you was fly like me (Like me)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I'm blowin' money from saving every penny
Now we getting drunk, no chasin' with the Henny
The women at the party go nuts when we roll up
Dirty broads on the stage like, "So what?"
They don't give a fuck, they try and live it up
She look a little bored, pour some liquor in her cup
I dress like money, ain't none of this free, bitch
Young boy got these hoes covered like Revis
Rollin' stone, satisfaction
Cop a couple bottles, spend a night in Manhattan
Tell the bartender, "All drinks on me"
Rollin' in the club with a fake ID

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Now the cameras flashin' (Now the cameras flashin')
All eyes on me (All eyes on me)
Yeah, now we gettin' paid so you know we feelin' great
At the club, motherfucker, all drinks are free
The light so bright, I'm feelin' so nice
Girl, we can get right, but just for the night (For the night)
It feel great to be fly like me (Like me)
I bet you wish that you was fly like me (Like me)

[Outro: Darrelle Revis]
With my boy Mac Miller, he doin' his thing, you know?
Out here grindin', hey, represent for the 'Burgh, man
'Preciate you now, I just 'preciate gettin' on this track with you
So we gettin' it in, havin' fun in the studio
Let's get it, y'all gon' like this track though
Peace

[Verse 1]
Hey little mama
Ain't gotta ask me if I want to
Tell me, can I get a light?
Roll you up and let it run through my veins
'Cause I can always see the farthest stars when I'm on you
I don't wanna ever come down from this cloud of loving you

[Chorus]
'Cause now you got me hopped up on that
Pusher love
So high, I’m on the ceiling, baby
You're my drug
So gon' and be my dealer, baby
Roll me up
'Cause all I want is you, baby

Pusher girl
So high, I’m on the ceiling, baby

You're my little pusher love girl, ain't ya?
Just my little pusher love girl

[Verse 2]
Now hey little mama

And I know that your supply
Won't run out anytime soon
You gave me a taste, now I know that there's no getting off you
I don't wanna ever come down off this cloud of lovin' you

[Chorus]
'Cause now you got me hopped up on that
Pusher love
So high, I’m on the ceiling, baby
You're my drug
So gon' and be my dealer, baby

[Bridge]
Since you came around
I've been living a different life
And I don't wanna come down
From this love I got on high
And people call me a user
But I want you to go on and use me too
Nothing else will do
All I want is you babe, I know
Baby, you know who you are

[Chorus]
Now you got me hopped up on that
Pusher love
So high, I’m on the ceiling, baby
You're my drug
So gon' and be my dealer, baby

You're my little pusher love girl
So sweet, yes you are (Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah)
Just my little pusher love girl, ain't ya? (Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah)
She's my little pusher love girl

[Outro]
Sing it, pusher love
I'm just a, junkie for your love
I'm just a, junkie for your love (C'mon)
Now I'm just a, junkie for your love (I'm hopped up on it)
And now I'm just a junkie for your love (Break it down)
My heroine, my cocaine, my plum wine, my MDMA
I'm hopped up on it, it won't go away
Now I can't wait 'til I get home and get you in my veins (Pusher love)
I'm just a, junkie for your love (I'm hopped up on it)
And now I'm just a, junkie for your love (Pusher love)
I'm just a, junkie for your love (I'm hopped up on it)
And now I'm just a, junkie for your love
Uh, my nicotine, my blue dream, my hydroponic candy jelly bean
Did you fix me up, I'm your number one fiend
Be my little pill and just creep into my bloodstream
Bloodshot eyes, I'm hopped up on it
You ain't gotta think twice, just hop up on it
There's a million names for your kind of chronic
Uh, that pusher love, that's what I call it (Pusher love)
I'm just a, junkie for your love (I'm hopped up on it)
Now I'm just a, junkie for your love
Let me hear you say (pusher love)
Now I'm just a, junkie for your love (I'm hopped up on it)
And now I'm just a, junkie for your love
(Pusher love)
(Pusher love)
(Pusher love)

[Intro: Timbaland]
Hi, how ya'll feeling tonight?
Thank ya'll for coming out to the the Y's Underground Club
Our first act up
All the way from Memphis, Tennessee
Show him some Southern love, JT and the Tennessee kids
Come on! Give it up

[Interlude: Justin Timberlake]
Thank you for having us out tonight
We're JT and the Tennessee Kids
One, two, three!
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
Didn't have to run, I knew it was love from a mile away
But I had to catch you, running through my mind all day baby
They all say I'm crazy, 'cause anybody even when your father say
That I can't be with you, I don't hear a word they say

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
'Cause I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
'Cause I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
So what? You're from the other side of the tracks
So what? The world don't think we match
I'll put it down like my love's on wax
Guess what? I'm in love with that girl
And she told me, that she's in love with me

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Now we didn't have to fall, but we fell in love to the bottom, babe
No one's there to catch us, like when you fell from Heaven that day, baby
People always staring, but I don't care nothing about it, babe
Since I saw your face, I've been staring just the same

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
So what? You're from the other side of the tracks
So what? The world don't think we match
I'll put it down like my love's on wax, guess what
I'm in love with that girl
And she told me, that she's in love with me

[Verse 3: Justin Timberlake]
My pretty lady
You'll always be my baby, baby, baby
It's so amazing
How you became my baby, baby, baby
My little daisy
Come here, let me rock you like a baby, baby, baby
Pretty lady
Don't you know, you'll always be my baby, baby, baby
Now don't it seem like these days
That everybody's got something to say
But I don't pay attention to the talk, baby
And I don't really care if they stop and stare
'Cause they see my number one
My number one girl

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
I told you I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
I don't care
So what? You're from the other side of the tracks
So what? The world don't think we match
I'll put it down like my love's on wax, guess what
I'm in love with that girl
And she already told me that she's in love with me

[Outro: Justin Timberlake]
I'm in love, yes, I'm in love with that girl
I don't care what people say, people say
Cause I'm in love with that girl

[Chorus: Drake]
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fuckin' here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team fuckin' here

[Verse 1: Drake]
I done kept it real from the jump
Livin' at my mama’s house, we'd argue every month
Nigga, I was tryin' to get it on my own
Workin' all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle calling me like "Where ya at?
I gave you the keys told ya bring it right back”
Nigga, I just think it's funny how it goes
Now I’m on the road, half a million for a show
And we...

[Chorus: Drake]
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fuckin' here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team fuckin' here

[Verse 2: Drake]
Boys tell stories about ya man
Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah, I doubt it
Nigga, I could turn your boy into the man
There ain't really much I hear that's poppin' off without us
Nigga, we just want the credit where it's due
I’mma worry about me, give a fuck about you
Nigga, just as a reminder to myself
I wear every single chain, even when I’m in the house
Cause we...

[Chorus: Drake]
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fuckin' here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team fuckin' here

[Bridge: Drake]
No new niggas, nigga we don’t feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where're your real friends at?
We don’t like to do too much explainin'
Story stays the same, I never changed it
No new niggas, nigga we don’t feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where're your real friends at?
We don’t like to do too much explainin'
Story stay the same through the money and the fame
Cause we...

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Came in the game with no lane and then changed it
These fuck niggas'll say it in ten different ways
Then see you and smile in your face
You wanna meet up, name a time or a place
I’m smokin' that fire, my nigga you know that it’s fire
You smell it as soon as I blaze
Burnin' a pound, burnin' a pound, burnin' a pound
Yeah, it’s goin' down, it’s goin' down, it’s goin' down
Started from the bottom now we here
Had a dream bout a car, and went and got it in a year
All black trucks when we pull up to the Lear
All black Coupe, I look like Bruce when I’m steerin'
Hope the homie Drake don’t get pissed
But niggas never ever put your man on songs like this
And I probably said no to it before
But I made 20 millions so we should probably go on tour
And I just seen Waka the other day
He wasn’t trippin', we just talked about the money we been makin'
Cause we…

[Chorus: Drake]
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fuckin' here
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now my whole team here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we're here
Started from the bottom now the whole team fuckin' here

[Verse 1]
Come on, come on
You think you drive me crazy?
Well, come on, come on

[Refrain]
You and whose army?
You and your cronies

[Verse 2]
Come on, come on
Holy Roman Empire
Come on if you think
Come on if you think
You can take us on
You can take us on

[Refrain]
You and whose army?
You and your cronies

[Verse 3]
You forget so easy
We ride tonight
We ride tonight
Ghost horses
Ghost horses
We ride tonight
We ride tonight
Ghost horses
Ghost horses
Ghost horses

[Verse 1]
After years of waiting
Nothing came
As your life flashed before your eyes
You realize

[Chorus]
I'm a reasonable man
Get off, get off, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case

[Post-Chorus]
After years of waiting

[Verse 2]
After years of waiting
Nothing came
And you realize you're looking in
Looking in the wrong place

[Chorus]
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my case

[Bridge]
After years of waiting

[Chorus]
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my case

[Verse 1]
I might be wrong, I might be wrong
I could have sworn I saw a light coming on
I used to think, I used to think
There was no future left at all
I used to think

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Open up, begin again

[Chorus 1]
Let's go down the waterfall
Think about the good times and never look back
Never look back

[Verse 2]
What would I do? What would I do?
If I did not have you?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Open up and let me in

[Chorus 2]
Let's go down the waterfall
Have ourselves a good time, it's nothing at all
It's nothing at all, nothing at all

[Outro]
Keep it moving
Keep it moving

[Verse 1]
I want you to know he's not coming back
Look into my eyes, I'm not coming back

[Chorus 1]
So knives out, catch the mouse
Don't look down, shove it in your mouth

[Verse 2]
If you'd been a dog, they would have drowned you at birth
Look into my eyes
It's the only way you'll know I'm telling the truth

[Chorus 2]
So knives out, cook him up
Squash his head, put him in the pot

[Verse 3]
I want you to know he's not coming back
He's bloated and frozen
Still there's no point in letting it go to waste

[Chorus 3]
So knives out, catch the mouse
Squash his head, put him in the pot

[Verse 1]
Come a little bit closer
Hear what I have to say
Just like children sleeping
We could dream this night away
But there's a full moon rising
Let's go dancing in the light
We know where the music's playing
Let's go out and feel the night

[Chorus]
Because I'm still in love with you
I want to see you dance again
Because I'm still in love with you
On this harvest moon

[Verse 2]
When we were strangers
I watched you from afar
When we were lovers
I loved you with all my heart
But now it's getting late
And the moon is climbing high
I want to celebrate
See it shining in your eye

[Chorus]
Because I'm still in love with you
I want to see you dance again
Because I'm still in love with you
On this harvest moon

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Because I'm still in love with you
I want to see you dance again
Because I'm still in love with you
On this harvest moon

[Verse 1]
When you were young and on your own
How did it feel to be alone?
I was always thinking of games that I was playing
Trying to make the best of my time

[Chorus]
But only love can break your heart
Try to be sure right from the start
Yes, only love can break your heart
What if your world should fall apart?

[Verse 2]
I have a friend I've never seen
He hides his head inside a dream
Someone should call him and see if he can come out
Try to lose the down that he's found

[Chorus]
But only love can break your heart
Try to be sure right from the start
Yes, only love can break your heart
What if your world should fall apart?

[Outro]
I have a friend I've never seen
He hides his head inside a dream
Yes, only love can break your heart
Yes, only love can break your heart
Yes, only love can break your heart
Yes, only love can break your heart
Yes, only love can break your heart

[Verse 1]
Old man lying by the side of the road
With the lorries rolling by
Blue moon sinking from the weight of the load
And the buildings scrape the sky
Cold wind ripping down the alley at dawn
And the morning paper flies
Dead man lying by the side of the road
With the daylight in his eyes

[Chorus]
Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Find someone who's turning
And you will come around

[Verse 2]
Blind man running through the light of the night
With an answer in his hand
Come on down to the river of sight
And you can really understand
Red lights flashing through the window in the rain
Can you hear the sirens moan?
White cane lying in a gutter in the lane
If you're walking home alone

[Chorus]
Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Find someone who's turning
And you will come around

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Just find someone who's turning
And you will come around

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Don't let it bring you down
It's only castles burning
Just find someone who's turning
And you will come around
Hey ho away we go
We're on the road to never

Where life's a joy
For girls and boys
And only will get better

Hey ho away we go
We're on the road to never

Romeo and Juliet
The doctor and his case
Without a plan they left the van
And there were laid to waste

Hey ho away we go
We're on the road to never

The priest was there
With sandy hair
Religion by his side
He saw his law was broken
The punishment was applied
Hey ho away we go
Along the road to never
Hey ho away we go
We're on the road to never

[solo]

He held her hand
And wished her well
Although his heart was aching
The cameras rolled
The print was bold
The holy war was breaking
It's hey ho away we go
We're on the road to never
Where life's a joy
For girls and boys
And only will get better

Hey ho away we go
Along the road to never
Hey ho away we go
We're on the road to never
Hey ho away we go
Along the road to never
Hey ho away we go
We're on the road to never

[solo]

The priest was there
With sandy hair
Religion by his side
He saw his law was broken
The punishment was applied

[Hook](x2)
I've been cruisin' in my old school
While I'm rolling all through Cleveland, in the evening

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
I've been drinking all night, but I'm cool to roll
Red lights, stop at 'em very slow
Playing, "Feel So Good" by Mase
I got three chicks, one in the back, it's never up
Two chicks up in the front with me
They love the midwest accent thing
So I'm steady on my game talk
Steady on my good side
Love the Cleveland swag
Doors swinging, we some clowns right?
Girlies all around as we pull up to the Mirage
And I just open up the doors on 'em
Cudder lean got 'em in my Bathing Apes
Got 'em all intrigued
All I can do is just smile and wave
Cause that's how it be, when you paid

[Hook]
I've been cruisin' in my old school
While I'm rolling all through Cleveland, in the evening

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Now the mood is good, the champagne's flowin'
And she's feeling me, I'm digging where we goin' (and uh)
After the club we headed straight to the IHOP (the IHOP)
But I'm sipping slow, trying to remain at ease
Waving my hand, doing my dance at peeps (what it do)
Me and my leaners we gon' party and all that, and all that (and we will)
So we gather on a zip, my shit rock
I rap hard, Kid Cudi got that mean mean, the crackheads
Hoes look who when I whip whip the cutlass, the cutlass
So I can't even trip because I love it when I'm ridin'
That Cleveland city whip appeal I need it I ain't lyin'
I love it just as much as model girls and Hennessy cognac
And it's all that, so I be

[Hook]
I've been cruisin' in my old school
While I'm rolling all through Cleveland, in the evening

[Verse 3: In-Doe]
(Cudi man we gotta tell 'em how we do it in the NY)
Hey hey, yeah your boy stay fade
Higher than you sire, yes that's how I stay
About to blow fast you could call it Minute Maid
But I've never been that minute man I'm in it to amaze
Cudi killed the track, the flowers in the vase
Dude so cold you could put him in a grave
Here with some leaners
Dude's washed up, you could call us the cleaners
About to see home boy, sitting in the Beamer
With a dime chick cause she love my demeanor
Cudi, that's my buddy
He get a full discount, nigga just like a senior
Floatin', smoking on that funky cold me-haze
You see, we cruisin' like the Nina and the Pinta
Crack the Dutch, got light green with magenta
I'll show ya how to do this
Yes I'm the instructor
Come ride with a nigga cuz I'm the conductor

[Hook]
I've been cruisin' in my old school
While I'm rolling all through Cleveland, in the evening

Let me hold that beat... 

[x3]
That beat
Funny, funny, funny, boy I can't stop laughing
Money, money, money, can't stop getting cash
You looking for the prince, well you found him
Broke niggas can't even be around him
And I'm only being honest, fuck being modest
Ghetto girls change hair colors like Rodman
All on my dick like a condom
And she take that dick like a robber
Call it burglary, certainly
I cut her up like surgery
And now her baby daddy wants to murder me!
He call my phone like "Is you banging my girl? My girl!"
All I reply "Playa better check her. Don't wanna to disrespect ya.. I never even met 'cha. She never even mention your name. I don't know why you mad at me. You should ask your girl. She gave the ass to me. Stop harassing me... Why you so upset with me? I don't even know you
It's clear that she had sex with me. Stop calling my phone, dude. Real G's do no questioning."

He talking bout what you gon' do, gon' do
Funny, funny, funny, boy I can't stop laughing
Money, money, money, can't stop getting cash
You a loser though
You a loser though
You a loser

Fellas if your girl let a man get at her
And you hit up the man then your ass playing backwards
Happens to the best, you are not alone
Her booty and her breat, it's nothing you can own

Funny, funny, funny, boy I can't stop laughing
Money, money, money, can't stop getting cash

Throw it in the bag, got paper got plastic
Think I got it mastered, haters are fanatics
I need them around any time I want my ass kissed
I'm only drinking brown and I'm only smoking sunkist
Orange haired weed got me acting like a wierdo
Shine like me you the diamonds in my earlobe
Heard from a bird that trigga was a asshole
Fuck what you heard like penis in your earhole

September 1st

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
Wishing I could wrap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold
Lately, I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls
Yup, diamonds and pearls
And enough money I could rule the world
If I ruled the world, yeah, if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world man, it got me thinking man if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world, if I ruled the world
I could rule the world man, if I ruled the world

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
If I ruled the world, I would buy it all
I'm addicted to champagne and buying the mall
I'm addicted to living life above the law
How much do it take to live above the law??
I call my homie Ralph up, cause his car stop
Told him bump a new car, come grab the car lot
That way you can have convertibles, and a hardtop
Open up a few doors, since we had a hard knock, life
Like, open up
Where restaurants and legs stay opened up
Start a franchise so my dawg can quit wearing
A .44 up on his waist like it's his pants size
And to my OG locked up bumping "Ready or Not"
Who was just trying to do it big, but wasn't ready to die
Cop a first class whatever he like, with hoes already inside
Now he can rest in peace while he alive
Fuckin' right

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko, J. Cole]
Wishing I could wrap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold
Lately, I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls
Yup, diamonds and pearls
And enough money I could rule the world (Cole World)
If I ruled the world, yeah, if I ruled the world (Cole)
If I ruled the world man, it got me thinking man if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world, if I ruled the world
I could rule the world man, if I ruled the world (Cole World)

[Verse 2: J. Cole & Big Sean]
Is this a dream? Well that's how it feel
Sometimes I got to pinch a fat ass to see if it's real
I specifically remember, no heat in the winter
Now I supply heat for the winter
Then I skate to the beach for the winter
When it comes to chips boy, nigga get a grip
No cleats I'm a winner
Show love to the hoes and the freaks I remember
Hit the club and raise hell all week for the sinners
Meet a young Dennis, the menace to society
Check my sobriety, fuck hoes in varieties
Shame that these things is the reasons you admire me
But, I'm getting dough man, these flows gon' retire me
Splurging all crazy
Switching lanes in the Range swerving all crazy (Swerve)
Style on Nadal, I've been serving y'all lately, cheddar on Federer
Ball till I fall, et cetera, et cetera

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
Wishing I could wrap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold
Lately, I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls
Yup, diamonds and pearls
And enough money I could rule the world
If I ruled the world, yeah, if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world man, it got me thinking man if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world, if I ruled the world
I could rule the world man, if I ruled the world

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
(Yeah, yeah)
Grey wiley black stitching
On a train, same slang, plain Jane, the style is crispy
24 karats gazelles clear, yeah
I'm so fly real year
Price so la, feel weary
Besides killin gear
It's sniffin', plain white lines
But jumpin' off phenomenal missions
Yep drugs sellers that was in '88
Learned how to true
To shoot through, my cool escape
My Uncle huskie karate nigga die, who stayed in jail
He did a twenty piece
He came home, block movers still know who he is
To us we was kids he said, "Get rich and love life"
Don't fuck with no pigs yo, those days are hazed
Now we in chronic mode, no more plays
Runnin' up a rob a clothes, home or what
All we had was us and its sucks
The fly niggas is broke
Smoke coke, weed, and dust
I changed for the better, brand new Beretta
Slappin' a nigga face at the steal give me your leather
Through it all I learned a lot
Plus I burned a lot
The chronic now returned the clock

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko, & Raekwon]
Wishing I could wrap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold (Yeah yo)
Lately, I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls
Yup, diamonds and pearls
And enough money I could rule the world
If I ruled the world, yeah, if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world man, it got me thinking man if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world, if I ruled the world
I could rule the world man, if I ruled the world

[Outro: Big Sean & Raekwon]
It wouldn't hurt so bad, I want you to know
It's the one and only dude, singing in tone, you dig?
And this is so many keys, the mixtape
Brought to you by my family
You already know what it is
Finally Famous over everything
My bro Key Wayne, my bro DJ Mo Beats, let's get it
Let's go, uh
A real playa like hiphop game
You know I do my thing
A real playa like hiphop game

[Hook]
They like the way you tilt your hat yo
Yea, that's Phat Joe

Man, that's Phat Joe
They like the way you kill a track yo
I'm saying, that's Phat Joe
They really like the way you rap yo
Yea, that's Phat Joe

[Verse 1]
First let me say, that I really like this track
I call it Phat Joe, this ain't no Fat Joe diss track
So, Lupe don't play like the disc scratch
I send trouble your way, like a dispatch
Hello, 911
Lupe's back and he took my gun
And then the gangastas
Saw all or none of that
The yakuzas took my thumbs
But now, I gots to get to runnin'
Cause the pigs is comin'
Like it's, troubles my way
Just a hustler's day, YOUNGIN'
Took it out the hood like Mr Drummonds
Then I put it on the hood of a 911 and
And that's really the back so
I put it on my back, and now I'm runnin'
Like I'm addicted to crack
And you can't catch a trackstar
Set don't phase me and I'm stunnin'
Ah

[Hook]
He crazy, he ain't got no brain
What up ladies, he ain't got no fame
He dropping mean, but he ain't got no name
Lupe, Chi-Chi-Chicago mayne

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Uh, now if you're looking for Lu
You can find me in your city, looking for you
In Supreme looking for hoodies, in Daves looking for shoes
In LA I'm looking for Stussy, don't push me fool
I'm a push a man, don't get it while it's hot
You should wait till the cookies cool
I learned that from a pusha man, who used to push weight
But had to wait till his cookies cooled
Uh, an OG since OBGYN
Homie I had to go to rookie school
A nerd, so the bullies had it out for the kid
But they had to honor me like algebra trig
I used to go to sleep to the sounds of the seas
I used to count the lakes like the owl and a kid
They used to hate sending one bound for the bed
Retarded now, heading down for the kid

[Hook]

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Got a good reason
For taking the easy way out
Got a good reason
For taking the easy way out, now

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
She was a day tripper
A one way ticket, yeah
It took me so long
To find out, and I found out

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]

A Sunday driver, yeah

To find out, and I found out

Day tripper
Day tripper, yeah
Day tripper
Day tripper, yeah
Day tripper
Whether in a penthouse or a cave dweller
I can tell you 'bout now I'm not a fortune teller
Grab a treat from Yosi, my muffin seller
Got mad technique like Rudy Van Gelder
And yes I got a plan I'm a carry out it
Yes, I'm pro-choice, I'm a-scream and shout it
Yes I love life and I try not to doubt it
Yes I'm gonna party cause I'm 'bout it 'bout it
When it rains I don't use an umbrella
When I write rhymes, I use indeli-ble ink
That will make you think
Flowing like water that you love to drink

NOW get busy

Sweet like a nut filled with Nutella
Creamy like buffalo mozzarella
Sneaking around you know I smell ya
Well I play ya like a peanut and throw the shell ya
Well I could give a fuzz if ya think you're a baller
I get so many huni 'round  you fall smaller
Middle school rapper and a proud yes y'aller
If ya think about your grandma go ahead call her
From the East Coast so I don't say hella
At the mic stand my performance is stellar
Pop the tape in and I listen to fella
I give a little shout to Nelson Mandela
NOW get busy

Known for the words that make you scream and holler
I'm Count Dooku to your Queen Amidala
Give a shout to Spiro or John Waller
I'm a student of the game and a bona fide scholar
So ease up on the bong to ease that coughin'
Butter's on the table now watch it soften
Bring in those beats and I'm a bring them often
I'm a keep rappin' when I'm in my coffin
Like a mind gone mad that is unwinding
In a padded room the walls you're climbing
Don't sign on the line if it looks binding
Ya have to get loose and find the lining

NOW get busy

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Ya girl been hot since Corduroys
Since quarter waters,and all the boys used to
Try to beat like the corner boys
'Cause they heard the pussy wetter, than themDorney rides
Fuck with who? Fucks with you
As long as them checks clear like Huxtable
I’m known to hang, with a thug or two
Niggas that only do, what a thug would do
Ask about me, the FEDS watch daily
Gettin’ more cheese, more bread than a deli
And I’m getting’ love, fan mail like Melly
And I throw it up, twelve o’clock when I wheelie
I’m in the A, I scoop my nigga J
Coupe gotta be grey, you gotta get paid
Ain’t nothin’ worse, than being a broke bitch
I always got crack, I tell ‘em to smoke this

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yo, ya boy been nice since thunder cats
Since leather boomers and lumber jacks
Come outside with a hundred stack
Jeans with the sweat pants under that, yeah
Front on who? Not on me
Niggas know I keep the seventeen shot on me
Made a lil something off rap, lot off D
Get your points off another nigga, not off me
Air forces, new trues and a crispy tee
New coupe, nigga, CL-63
Cost you nothin’, we get hit for free
With Nicki, matter fact, nah, the bitch with me

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
So you wanna sip goose and play Nintendo Wii? No
Get the bricks and flip the yayo
Chirp, if you looking for the work
Hundred dollars of pussy, my misses getting’ busy
FEDs getting dizzy, niggas trying to get me
So I change the sizzy combination, to the cizzy
Brand new V, that’s what I get for pitchin
Nice little crib, a couch that I could sit in
Umm, I mean sit on, blow piff, fuck a bitch on
Oops, I mean feller, keeps the umbrell-er
And I only fuck with them paper makers
Nicki Lewinski, LK to Jada

[Verse 1]
There are better things to talk about
Be constructive
Bear a weapon we can use
Be constructive with your blues
Even when it's only warnings
Even when you're talking war games

[Chorus 1]
Why don't you quiet down?
(Maybe I want peace and honesty)
Why don't you quiet down?
(Maybe I want to live in the children's land
And you know maybe, maybe I)
Why don't you quiet down?
(Maybe I'll wander the promised land
I want peace and honesty)
Why don't you quiet down?
(I want to live in the promised land
And maybe wander the children's land)
Quiet down! (Yeah, and there, there we can free)

[Verse 2]
You don't live in a business world and
You never go out and you never stay
We all have goals in a liberal world
Living in times when I could stand it, babe
All over, babies crying
It'll all over, maybe, I can see out of here
All over the planet's dead
All over the planet, so let me out of here
All over the, all over the, all over the, all over the

[Chorus 2]
(Quiet down)
We are the dollars and cents and the pounds and pence
And the mark and the yen, and yeah
(Why don't you quiet down?)
We're gonna crack your little souls
We're gonna crack your little souls
(Why don't you quiet down?)
We are the dollars and cents and the pounds and pence
And the pounds and pence, and yeah
(Why don't you quiet down?)
We're gonna crack your little souls
Crack your little souls
We are the dollars and cents
Action Bronson
Yeah

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Hey yo
It's the aggressor with the nickle plated pressure
Hit you hard like London Fletcher, leave you sleeping on the stretcher
Action Osama ain't the one to play games with
Ain't shit changed dick, I'm still the same with the same click, prick
Cross your legs when you sit down in the chair
My nuts are there, rape your mother live in despair
We'll take the candy out your daughters mouth
Order up a porterhouse, smoke a quarter ounce
Cores at the Norvin House, corner standing below three
Frozen cheeks, frozen feet
Niggas holding heat cause its a cold street
Heavy bearded blowing blunts the face, roll another blunt to chase
Roasted perfection perfectly done to taste
Old and new it's Nike zooted like a lunar flight
Been blowing Buddha right, I never eat the tuna, sike
Both fists are gloved up, you dumb fuck
Get left in dump trucks, when I commence the duck hunt
Two o'clock you hear the cannon pop, right outside the Spanish spot
Converted the drug den we call the cannon spot
Grab the money out the safe, shoot him in the waist
Just a little taste, before I finish off his face
Sports drop lightly breaded like a pork chop
Drug and gems, money stashed it in the floor spot
Barry Bronson shooting juice before the Mitchell Report
Never snitching in court, we blitzing the fort
All my niggas pitching for sport
Putting up Clemen numbers, four bitches shit in the bag
And now there's seven Hummers

[Verse 2: Science]
Hey yo a fantasy crazy the form it is
Of a supreme being that has strange ways of gathering cream
Grade-A stopped of cop blocked hard rocks and
Get knocked by undercover narcs in the park after dark
Oil dripping, tire spinning free will showing that crime sells
Doing big deals with krills, eating high-priced meals
We still dipping police, flipping hashish
Causing moms great grief, when you hit them streets
Cause we have precise understanding of dismantling
Words you planning, you start to scrambling
Put your life to gambling, the black heart nigga
Who start shit no babe? departed
I know more than one word besides arson
I got intensity with my history
Blaze, haze more than the sun rays
Glow more the MICer with the Jerry-curl glaze
My passion is right there with fashion
I feel a fever
That's why I'm reaching like a baby that was teething
Saying it's time for me to start the eating
Science is teaching
You preaching prophecies of an untold road
That finally unfold that behold the truth of the real foes
ID's were known
My pat is on they toes
Shot fired, police scatter like crows
Full-body blow
React like a high women terrain like it's Halo
Blunts burn slow, I put pieces together like it's Lego
Before you say go, six niggas hit the floor like "Yeyo!"
Dry up and crumble like it's Play-Doh
Because I say so
Rest in peace 357
My baby, I love her

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Well, I bounce in past the bouncer, with a handgun and a chopper
Well, I bounce in past the bouncer, with a handgun and a rifle
I might bounce in, me a bouncer, handgun and an ounce
Young nigga with a shotgun, and a handgun, and a rifle
Get pitched in, I’m a lifer – put my hand on the Bible
You walking fast, you need to slow up, ho
Acting lame, you need to grow up, ho
Got drank, I’m ‘bout to pour up, ho
I was broke, but I ain’t broke no more
No place the GuWop can’t go
Trap rap, fuck hip-hop, ho
Rambo with a loaded four-four
Commando, kick in your front door
Jesús, Alejandro
Get your whole family killed like El Chapo
Lots of guap and escundo
Drop the top, I’m in a new Lambo’
Let your daddy know, twin Calicos
And I’ll kill your ass if you like to gamble
County man, if your ass didn’t know
Like Cunningham I make your ass ran, ho
Afghanistan, I’m a travelling man
And when I pull up, got an army van
You must live in Fantasy Land
Cut off you and your partner hand
Candyman, I’m from the scrap
And I’ll leave your partner’s ass handicapped

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Handicap, handicap, handicap, handicap
Run up on me and I’mma leave you handicapped
Handicap, handicap, handicap, handicap
I keep a pistol by me, I’ve got handy scraps
Handicap, handicap, handicap, handicap
Shoot you in your head, youse in your partner lap
Handicap, handicap, handicap, handicap
Guap like the wheelchair niggas, handicapped

[Verse 2: Big Bank Black]
Heard he beefing with the mob, call him Two Wheel Willie
You ain’t no gangster, pussy nigga, youse a World Star bully
Just a key-boy gangster, talking tough as your train
We bustin’ tommy guns, pussy, like back in the day
I run with butcher-knife killers, they might chop off your fade
I got them crazy young niggas, they might jump out the state
Godfather status – I might spit in your face
And don’t be muggin’ pussy nigga, slap that look off your face
And if you want it, come get it – all my niggas with it
Got Nuke and Squeak with me, you know the carbon spittin’
You know them niggas hitting, you know they gone blast
If you fuck around and live, you in a body cast

[Hook: Gucci Mane]

[Verse 1]
Never thought that I'd say
I wish I didn't love you ever since the first date
When you got close, my heart would just stop
Thought me and you together would end up on top
You changed me for better, for worse
I know I was caught up, always put you first
I never once thought you would be trifling
But oh, I was blinded

[Pre-Chorus]
I was like (Oh, oh, oh)
Never wanna let you (Go, go, go)
I was open before (Had me open before)
But now I know

[Chorus]
Love made me blind, so I couldn't see
All the lies you told were right in front of me
Since love made me blind, you made a fool of me
You made it look so perfect when it wasn't meant to be
Your love made me blind

[Verse 2]
I gave all of my trust
Didn't think being faithful was asking too much
But I'm good, glad that I know now
I was fooled but fate let me see how
They say every tear has its reasons
Every smile has its own season
Never once thought you would be trifling
But oh, I was blinded

[Pre-Chorus]
I was like (Oh, oh, oh)
Never wanna let you (Go, go, go)
I was open before (Had me open before)
But now I know

[Chorus]
Love made me blind, so I couldn't see
All the lies you told were right in front of me
Since love made me blind, you made a fool of me
You made it look so perfect when it wasn't meant to be
Love made me blind (Blind)
Your love made me blind (Blind)
Love made me blind (Blind)
Your love made me blind (Blind)

[Bridge]
'Cause when I, I felt your lips pressed against mine
Thought the sweet smell of your perfume was all mine
Didn't know you were a beautiful liar
'Cause love made me blind

[Chorus]
Love made me blind, so I couldn't see (So I couldn't see)
All the lies you told were right in front of me
Since love made me blind, you made a fool of me
You made it look so perfect when it wasn't meant to be
Your love made me blind (Blind)
Your love made me blind (Blind)
Your love made me blind (Blind)
Your love made me blind (Blind)

[Intro]
"Three, two... fire!"

[Verse 1]
So ya thought ya might like to go to the show
To feel the warm thrill of confusion, that space cadet glow
I've got some bad news for you sunshine
Pink isn't well, he stayed back at the hotel
And they sent us along as a surrogate band
We're gonna find out where you fans really stand

[Verse 2]
Are there any queers in the theater tonight?
Get them up against the wall
(Against the wall)
Now there's one in the spotlight, he don't look right to me
Get him up against the wall
(Against the—)
And that one looks Jewish and that one's a coon!
Who let all of this riff-raff into the room?
There's one smoking a joint and another with spots
If I had my way, I'd have all of them shot!

[Instrumental Outro]

[Intro]
Ooh, ah-ah-ah
Ah (Ayy), ah (Oh)

[Verse 1]
Every day I realize
That this might be the last day of my life
Walking down the street, I find, yeah
I'm coming closer and closer to losing my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause when it rains, it pours
Isn't life worth more?
I don't even know what I'm hustling for (Hustling for)
You gotta do what you gotta do
Just to make it through
All the hard times that's gonna face you (Mm-mm)

[Chorus]
This is the life (This is the life)
Striving to survive (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
This is the life (This is the life)
Striving to survive (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
This is the life

[Verse 2]
Living will always be a struggle
Looking for someone true to love you
Looking back, I see all the horrors
This madness makes me wanna hide

[Pre-Chorus]
I watch slowly
Internally, I'm dying
Pillowcase is wet from all my crying (Crying)
There ain't nothing more to be here for
Take me away, I can't live that life no more

[Chorus]
This is the life (This is the life)
Striving to survive  (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(If you look into my eyes)
This is the life (This is the life; my life)
Striving to survive (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Hustling, oh)
This is the life (Can you see what I'm seeing?)

[Intro: Alicia Keys & Jermaine Dupri]
Yeah, yeah, what
Uh-uh, uh, yeah, yeah, what?
2000
Your girlfriend
Alicia Keys
Uh-huh
J.D., wha' wha'
Come on

[Verse 1: Alicia Keys]
May be silly for me to feel
This way about you and her
'Cause I know she's been such a good friend
I know she has helped you through
Talkin' late on the phone
Every night you've been callin'
Private moments alone
Could your heart soon be fallin'?
And I know she's a friend
But I can't shake the feeling
That I could be losing your heart

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
Although, she's just a girl that is your friend (Your friend)
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
She shares a special part of you

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
You said that she's one who helped you see
How deep you're in love with me
And intentions were not to get in between
But I see possibilities
And you say that you feel
I'm the best thing in your life
And I know it's real
And I see it in your eyes
There's no reason for me
To even feel this way
I know you just enjoy her company

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
Although, she's just a girl that is your friend (Your friend)
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend (Your girlfriend)
She shares a special part of you
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
Although, she's just a girl that is your friend
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend (Girlfriend)
She shares a special part of you

[Bridge: Jermaine Dupri & Alicia Keys]
Say you're jealous, but you can't tell me why
Say you're jealous, but you can't tell me why
Say you're jealous, but you can't tell me why (Your girlfriend)
Say you're jealous, but you can't tell me why
Say you're jealous, but you can't tell me why
Say you're jealous, but you can't tell me why
Say you're jealous, but you can't tell me why
It's enough to make a nigga go crazy

[Chorus: Alicia Keys]
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
Although, she's just a girl that is your friend
I think I'm jealous of your girlfriend
She shares a special part of you

[Verse]
Hey, hey, hey
There is a joy in a sweet word that's been spoken
And the joy in a dream that's come true
There's a joy that I get when I'm watching you baby
And the joy that I get watching the skies of blue
And then there's a joy, oh my darling, of a crying baby
And the joy of a child that's born to you
Then there's a joy of a beautiful lady
And the joy of the morning dew

[Bridge]
It's something like the joy of loving you baby
Joy of dancing too
It's something like the joy of loving you baby
Joy of being with you

[Outro]
Oh my darling, I'll overcome the darkest nights
Just to see your love's alright
I've got a love to give
You know I love to live
There's something 'bout the joy of loving you baby
There's something 'bout the joy of loving you baby
There's something 'bout the joy of loving you baby
Damn, Good God

[Intro]
Lose your fucking mind
Un, deux, trois, quatre
Like a strobelight (Light, light, light, light, light)
Like a strobelight (Light, light, light, light, light)

[Verse 1]
I can't see you, babe, I feel you
Lost in this place 'til I found you
Playing hard to get, I-I-I know this game
Turning me on, switch it off again
One moment you're gone, the next you are here
Like smoke in my arms, you just disappear (C'mon)
One moment you're here, then you flash away
You're stu-stuttering, I-I-I want you to stay

[Chorus]
Strobelight, drop in your arms
Like a strobelight, so right, you're doing me wrong
And if I can get you for a second, all the sexing you'd be getting
Like a strobelight, drop in your arms
Like a strobelight (Light, light, light, light, light)
Like a strobelight (Light, light, light, light, light)

[Verse 2]
Is this a dream? Are you really there?
A trick of the eye, I-I, I saw you, I swear (Yeah)
One touch not enough, wanna dance with you all night
But you keep me in the, keep me in the half-life
You're running again, but losing the race
Is it love that you want? Or just the thrill of the chase?
One moment you're here, then you flash away
You're stu-stuttering, I-I-I want you to stay

[Chorus]
Strobelight, drop in your arms
Like a strobelight, so right, you're doing me wrong
And if I can get you for a second, all the sexing you'd be getting
Like a strobelight, drop in your arms
Like a strobelight (Light, light, light, light, light)
Like a strobelight (Light, light, light, light, light)

[Bridge]
If the lights were on, I'd hold your body
If we get them on we'd, get thing started
Would you take it off and, oh? Would you take it off and, oh?
I just want to turn you on, take it off
Like a strobelight
Put your hands up, put your hands up
Like a strobelight
Put your hands up, put your hands up, put your hands up

[Chorus]
Strobelight, drop in your arms (Let's go)
Like a strobelight, so right, you're doing me wrong
And if I can get you for a second, all the sexing you'd be getting
Like a strobelight, drop in your arms (Let's go)
Like a strobelight (Light, light, light, light, light) (Let's go, let's go, let's go)
Like a strobelight (Light, light, light, light, light) (Put your hands up)

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know it was a one night thing
Yeah, yeah, yeah
A one night stand
Can we do this again? Jason Derulo (let's go)

[Verse 1]
Would you mind, girl? If I told you
Last night really blew my mind
Would you mind, girl? No disrespect
But can we do it one more time?
Should I hit you up (up)? Should I just give up (up)?
Tell me, should I just walk away?
Would you let me in (in)? Should I just give in?
I need to get you back on the stage

[Chorus]
You're so amazing, remember the time
Just thinking about you, gives me butterflies
So open the curtains, and let me inside for more
Save the bell 'cause I want you now, baby, hit me with an encore
I want some more, I want some more
I want some more, baby, hit me with an encore
I want some more, I want some more
I want some more, baby, hit me with an encore
An encore, an encore

[Verse 2]
Would you like, girl, for me to touch you?
I can come and press rewind
Take it right back (back), rubbing your back
Trace your body, every line (chills)
Should I lay you down (down)? Should we do this now (now)?
Tell me when, just give me a sign (give me a sign)
Are you in or out (one)? Cause there ain't no doubt? (Yeah)
'Cause I'll make this night the night of your life

[Chorus]
You're so amazing, remember the time
Just thinking about you, gives me butterflies
So open the curtains, and let me inside for more
Save the bell 'cause I want you now, baby, hit me with an encore
I want some more, I want some more
I want some more, baby, hit me with an encore
I want some more, I want some more (yeah)
I want some more, baby, hit me with an encore
An encore, an encore
An encore, oh, woah

[Bridge]
Woah, woah, woah, an encore
Baby, hit me with an encore
Woah, woah, woah, an encore
Did you save the bell? 'Cause I want you now, baby, hit me with an encore

[Chorus]
You're so amazing, remember the time
Just thinking about you, gives me butterflies (gives me butterflies)
So open the curtains, and let me inside for more (for more)
Save the bell 'cause I want you now, baby, hit me with an encore
I want some more, I want some more
I want some more, baby, hit me with an encore
I want some more, I want some more
I want some more, baby, hit me with an encore
An encore, an encore
An encore, an encore
An encore, oh, woah, yeah (yeah)

[Intro]
Oh, oh, ooh
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 1]
You are the one who makes it worth waking up in the morning
I'd trade the sun, for the chance to show you I'm all in
We could be like Jay and Beyoncé, Bonnie and Clyde
Us like a movie
Take that chance on love, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I can't predict what the future holds (Holds)
But I'll fight forever to keep you close, yeah

[Chorus]
I'd give it all up, baby
Trade in the world to show I'm falling, I'm falling, yeah
Don't need the fame or money, long as I got you, girl
I'm falling, I'm falling
Tell all them other girls I've fallen
Oh, oh, ooh
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2]
Put me to the test, I'll prove to you I'll never be a heartache
'Cause you're the best, ha, you deserve the best
Rule this world like Michelle and Barack, be my girl, we'll end up on top
Take that chance on love, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I can't predict what the future holds (Holds)
But I'll fight forever to keep you close, yeah

[Chorus]
I'd give it all up, baby
Trade in the world to show I'm falling, I'm falling, yeah
Don't need the fame or money, long as I got you, girl

[Bridge]
Oh, I want the world to see (See), so I regulate some jewelry (-Ry)

Queen of hearts (Hearts)
Queen of hearts (Hearts)

[Verse 1]
She the type of girl to make you lazy, don't wanna do a thing
I been thinking crazy lately, like buying her a ring
I used to be at the party with ladies, getting down
I used to play with them girls but I'm thinking different now

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, she's a star (Star), she makes me fly (Fly)
Taking me places I never seen
Two worlds apart (Apart), but she don't mind (Mind)
'Cause she's got her wings

[Chorus]
I ain't the only one who loves
The attention isn't bad, girl
'Cause she's the queen of heart
She had me open from the start
Hand on heart, wish I dealt the cards
Shawty is the queen of hearts
Queen of hearts (Oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh
Shawty's the queen of hearts (Oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh
Shawty's the queen of hearts

[Verse 2]
Can't wait to wake up in the morning, knowing she'll be around
Heaven should have sent a warning before sending me an angel down
I used to chase all the money, the cars and all them broads
But I don't care for them things ever since she stole my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, she's a star (Star), she makes me fly (fly)
Taking me places I never seen
Two worlds apart (Apart), but she don't mind (Mind)

[Verse 1]
Have you ever had the feeling you were being watched?
Footsteps behind you like a shadow when you walk?
Can’t tell if your mind is playing tricks or not?
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, no
What I’m going through is now a rock in my brain
Thinking 'bout like do I got any enemies?
Where I’ve been, what I did, what did I say?
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, no, woah

[Pre-Chorus]
Come to think of it, I remember one chick
That I was messing with while I was in Connecticut
I met her after my show, I took her back to my room
The next day I had to go, I never thought it would

[Chorus]
Get (get) this deep (deep)
Now I got this problem following me (ayy)
You better be careful, better be careful, better be careful
Whose heart (heart) you’ll break (break)
You’re never knowing what she’ll do or say (say)
Will send ’em over the edge so, next time I’ll be careful

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I’m getting letters every other day addressed to me
Saying, "Dear Jason, you and I were meant to be"
Tell me you feel the same or it will be the death of me
Ayy, ayy, it gets worse now
She reaching out to all my people, friends and family (look)
Got me so paranoid; I’m stacking up security (woah)
It’s getting crazy here, it’s difficult for me to sleep
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, you know

[Pre-Chorus]
Now all I’m thinking is, how do I get out of this?
I’m feeling kind of sick, damn, this is some crazy shit
I met her after my show, I took her back to my room
The next day I had to go, I never thought it would

[Chorus]
Get (get) this deep (deep)
Now I got this problem following me (ayy)
You better be careful, better be careful, better be careful
Whose heart (heart) you’ll break (break)
You’re never knowing what she’ll do or say (say)
Will send ’em over the edge so, next time I’ll be careful
Yeah, oh, I'll be careful
Oh, yeah, woah, yo, yo

[Bridge]
This got so out of control, I learned my lesson now so
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, be careful (yeah, yeah)
She’s holding, no won’t let go (oh), she wants a piece of my soul (oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, be careful (yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
I met her after my show, I took her back to my room
The next day I had to go, I never thought it would

[Chorus]
Get (get) this deep (deep)
Now I got this problem following me (ayy) (following me)
You better be careful, better be careful, better be careful
Whose heart (heart) you’ll break (break) (whose heart you'll break)
You’re never knowing what she’ll do or say (say) (or say)
Will send ’em over the edge so
I never thought it would get (get) this deep (deep)
Now I got this problem following me (ayy)
You better be careful, better be careful, better be careful
Whose heart (heart) you’ll break (break)
You’re never knowing what she’ll do or say (say) (or say)
Will send ’em over the edge so, next time I’ll be careful
Oh, yeah, be careful

[Intro: Jason Derulo]
T-R-U-S-T me

[Verse 1: Jason Derulo]
I told you I was going out with my friends
You're following us, you’re spying on me yet again
How can I keep loving you?
You're acting like a bugaboo
More than jealous, your love is far from difficult
Searching through my phone is something like a ritual
T-R-U-S-T me
You say you’re crazy about me, but you’re just insane

[Pre-Hook: Auburn]
Boy, you beg and you plead asking me for a chance
I forgive and forget and you do it again
And I hate that I went and I fell in love
But I know you’re so wrong for me just because...

[Hook: Auburn]
You's a maniac, maniac for sure, for sure
And my friends tell me to just leave him alone
I gotta leave him alone
He’s a maniac, maniac, oh no no, oh no no no
And I think it’s time for me to up and go

[Verse 2: Jason Derulo]
I told you I was going out with my friends
You're following us, you’re spying on me yet again
How can I keep loving you?
You're acting like a bugaboo

T-R-U-S-T me
You say you’re crazy about me, but you’re just insane

[Pre-Hook: Auburn]

I forgive and forget and you do it again
And I hate that I went and I fell in love
But I know you’re so wrong for me just because...

You's a maniac, maniac for sure, for sure
And my friends tell me to just leave him alone
I gotta leave him alone
He’s a maniac, maniac, oh no no, oh no no no
And I think it’s time for me to up and go

[Bridge: Auburn]
You know
Give up
You know
Him go

[Hook: Auburn]
You's a maniac, maniac for sure, for sure
And my friends tell me to just leave him alone
I gotta leave him alone
He’s a maniac, maniac, oh no no, oh no no no
And I think it’s time for me to up and go, go-oh

[Verse 1]
I got a notion that says it doesn't feel right
Got an answer in your story today
It gave me a sign that didn't feel right, no

[Chorus]
So don't knock it, don't knock it
You've been here before
So don't knock it, don't knock it
You've been here before

[Verse 2]
I just wanted to know if I could go home
Been rambling day after day
And everyone says I don't know

[Chorus]
So don't knock it, don't knock it
You've been here before
So don't knock it, don't knock it
You've been here before
Got to notion to say what doesn't feel right
I just wanted to know if I could go home

[Chorus]
So don't knock it, don't knock it
You've been here before
So don't knock it, don't knock it
You've been here before

[Intro]
We're on, that's a nice way to start, Jonny

[Verse 1]
Are you such a dreamer
To put the world to rights?
I'll stay home forever
Where two and two always makes a five

[Verse 2]
I'll lay down the tracks
Sandbag and hide
January has April showers
And two and two always makes a five

[Bridge]
It's the devil's way now
There is no way out
You can scream and you can shout
It is too late now
Because

[Chorus]
You have not been
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
You have not been
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
You have not been
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
You have not been
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention
Paying attention

[Outro]
I try to sing along
But I get it all wrong
'Cause I'm not, 'cause I'm not
I swat 'em like flies
But like flies, the bugs keep coming back
Not, but I'm not
All hail to the thief
All hail to the thief
But I'm not, but I'm not
But I'm not, but I'm not
Don't question my authority or put me in a box
'Cause I'm not, cause I'm not
Oh, go and tell the king
That the sky is falling in
But it's not, but it's not, but it's not
Maybe not, maybe not

[Chorus]
Sit down, stand up
Sit down, stand up

[Verse 1]
Walk into the jaws of hell (sit down)
Walk into the jaws of hell (stand up)
Anytime (sit down)
Anytime (stand up)

[Chorus]
Sit down, stand up
Sit down

[Verse 2]
Hey, we can wipe you out anytime (stand up)
We can wipe you out (sit down)
Anytime
Anytime

[Interlude]
Stand up
Sit down

The raindrops, the raindrops
The raindrops, the raindrops

[Verse 1]
I sailed the moon
I spoke too soon
And how much did it cost?
I was dropped from moonbeams
And sailed on shooting stars

[Verse 2]
Maybe you'll be president
But know right from wrong
Or in the flood you'll build an Ark
And sail us to the moon

[Outro]
Sail us to the moon
Sail to the moon

[Verse 1]
We're rotten fruit, we're damaged goods
What the hell, we've got nothing more to lose
One gust and we will probably crumble
We're backdrifting

[Verse 2]
This far, but no further
I'm hanging off a branch
I'm teetering on the brink of
Honey sweets, so full of sleep
I'm backsliding

[Chorus]
You fell into our arms
You fell into our arms
We tried but there was nothing we could do
Nothing we could do

[Verse 3]
All evidence has been buried
All tapes have been erased
But your footsteps give you away
So you're backtracking

[Interlude]
Uh, uh, uh!

[Chorus]
You fell into our arms
You fell into our arms
We tried but there was nothing we could do
Nothing we could do

[Post-Chorus]
You fell into our, you fell into our...

[Verse 1]
We're rotten fruit, we're damaged goods
What the hell, we've got nothing more to lose
One gust and we will probably crumble
We're backdrifters

[Intro: Mike Shinoda]
Drop like "get up", take to the streets
Better lock that kid up, face full of teeth
When he hock that spit up, pacing the beat like a beast
Rocking the block on repeat

Speak from the cut like a rush of blood
Paint red on the sleeves of the ones you love
Lay the sick ones down and the bells will ring
Put pennies on the eyes, let the dead men sing

[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I shiver and shake the warm air cold
I'm alone on my own
In every mistake, I dig this hole
Through my skin and bones

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
It’s harder starting over
Than never to have changed

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
With blackbirds following me
I'm digging out my grave
They close in, swallowing me
The pain, it comes in waves
I'm getting back what I gave

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I sweat through the sheet as daylight fades
As I waste away
It traps me inside mistakes I've made
That's the price I pay

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
It’s harder starting over
Than never to have changed

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
With blackbirds following me
I'm digging out my grave
They close in, swallowing me
The pain, it comes in waves
I'm getting back what I gave

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
I drop to the floor like I did before
Stop watching, I'm coughing, I can't be more
What I want and what I need are at constant war
Like a well full of poison, a rotten core
The blood goes thin, the fever stings
And I shake from the hell that the habits bring
Let the sick ones down, the bells will ring
Put pennies on the eyes, let the dead men sing

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Blackbirds following me
I'm digging out my grave
They close in, swallowing me
The pain, it comes in waves

[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I'm getting back what I gave
I'm getting back what I gave
I'm getting back what I gave

[Intro (Action Bronson & Big Body Bes)]
Better slow down baby
I’m out here wildin'
Better slow down baby
Shit is crazy

[Chorus]
You need to slow down baby
My whole team cash and load out baby
I’m a hero in my home town, baby
Stop talking, just go down, baby

[Verse 1]
Shit on my chest, shoot colors like a care bear
All year see me tan, hopping out the van
You wasn’t there, now you tryna show face
Fuck around, be a cold case
Chrome skates on an old day
Remote control chains, promote dough for the veins
Poke chicks, hoes with vogue legs
Eat steaks off a gold plate, stoned, listening to Coldplay

[Chorus]
You need to slow down baby
My whole team cash and load out baby
I’m a hero in my home town, baby
Stop talking, just go down, baby

[Verse 2]
Long knife by the spinal, built like a rhino
Push the 635 to the finals
Pearl white like what you sniffin’ in your sinus
The finest vaginas demolished by my dick
One year from Queens to the top
Cream of the crop, serve a fiend out my sock
Five minutes till they lean like the drop
Now they spinning through the furnace like the scene from The Rock
Hide spinach like a doomsday prepper
Every Sunday in my Tuesday leather
Now my beard look like Uday and Qusay
Play the pool on a cool day

[Chorus]
You need to slow down baby
My whole team cash and load out baby
I’m a hero in my home town, baby
Stop talking, just go down, baby

[Verse 3]
A lot of people with their hands out now
Got these motherfuckers mad ‘cause I’mma stand out now
You never let the hammer off, you got the soft hands
I hear you singing for the boss man, dog
I’m from a lost land, spill coke on the heater
Drop a little sauce on the beater
Zero to 60 in a Porsche like a cheetah
New York, I'm like Jeter, light Caesar
No hypebeaster, rock a nice sneaker
You get drugs for a good price
My price cheaper, guaranteed
My trunk snapping like a tambourine
Bodying these pussies with a camera team

Uh! You better slow down, baby
Uh! You better slow down, baby
Uh! You better slow down, baby
You better slow down, baby

[Chorus]
You need to slow down baby
My whole team cash and load out baby
I’m a hero in my home town, baby
Stop talking, just go down, baby

[Outro]
You need to slow down baby
I'm a hero in my home town, baby

Well, I'm the best ever

[Intro]
Hey pretty lady
This goes out to you (This goes out to you, you, you)
I said it like a thousand times
But everyday still feels like the first day
(This goes out to you, you, you)
This is dedicated to you, dedicated to you, dedicated to you
Dedicated to you, dedicated to you, dedicated to you
Pretty lady, when you walk on by
It was such such a mellow, mellow, mellow day
When you walk by, sunshine
It was such a mellow, mellow, mellow

[Verse 1]
I, I can't deny the way you caught my eye
Then something strawberry filled up the sky
And everything on you intoxicates
It's a mystery, I don't know why
I let you kick in my do not disturb sign
But I guess your mouth in motion got me so high
And I could tell it’s pure just by the taste
And you kiss me

[Pre-Chorus]
So tell me you wanna get close somewhere far away, far away
Don't worry about your loving it won't go to waste, go to waste
Don't ever change your flavor 'cause I love the taste
And if you ask me where I wanna go, I say all the way

[Chorus]
'Cause she's just like nothing
That I ever seen before
Baby, please don't change nothing
Because your flavor's so original
And it all started when she said
Hey hey hey, smacking that strawberry bubblegum
You really got me when you said
Hey hey hey, popping that strawberry bubblegum
This goes out to you, this goes out to you

[Verse 2]
So tell me why, we're making love like professionals on the first time
Acting unprofessional but it works out
'Cause you don’t wanna work here anyway
And baby I, girl I'm all addicted and I won't fight
You and me that's the recipe for a good time
And it ain't really nothing but clothes in the way

[Pre-Chorus]
So tell me you wanna get close somewhere far away, far away
Don't worry about your loving it won't go to waste, go to waste
Don't ever change your flavor 'cause I love the taste
And if you ask me where I wanna go, I say all the way

[Chorus]
'Cause she's just like nothing
That I ever seen before
Baby, please don't change nothing
Because your flavor's so original
And it all started when she said
Hey hey hey, smacking that strawberry bubblegum
You really got me when you said
Hey hey hey, popping that strawberry bubblegum
This goes out to you, this goes out to you

[Post-Chorus]
My little strawberry, strawberry, strawberry bubblegum
My little strawberry, strawberry, strawberry bubblegum
She's my little strawberry strawberry bubblegum
My little strawberry, strawberry, strawberry bubblegum
Hey, hey, hey

[Bridge]
If you'd be strawberry bubblegum
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop
Little girl won't you be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop
And then I'd love you 'til I'll make you pop
Strawberry bubblegum
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop
Little girl if you’d be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop
And then I'd love you 'til I make you pop

[Melody Change]

[Verse 3]
Come in, sit down, let me elevate your appetite
Any flavor you want. Now my selection is the tasty kind
But you, you're delicious on your own
After I break you down my fingers, it's so sweet
That's what you told me when I touched on your lips
Towel under the door, girl, before they pick up your scent ah
If you'll be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I'll be your blueberry lollipop
If you'll be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I'll be your blueberry lollipop
Then I'll love you 'til I make it pop
If you'll be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I'll be your blueberry lollipop
(Little girl, would you be my)
If you'll be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I'll be your blueberry lollipop
And then I'll love you 'til I make it pop
Hey, hey, hey
My little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum
My little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum
My little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum
My little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum
If you'll be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I'll be your blueberry lollipop
(Little girl, would you be my)
If you'll be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I'll be your blueberry lollipop
And then I’ll love you 'til I make it pop

[Verse 1]
Don't know why, but girl, I'm feeling close to you
Maybe it's this ocean view, I'm so emotional
And all these thoughts been dancing on my head
For too long, too long, too long!
I wrote a song for you, I wanna sing to you
But every time I'm close to you
The words wanna come out, but I forget
It's so strong, it's so strong, it's so strong!

[Bridge]
It might seem like I’m catching something
That’s because it’s true
I can't deny it, and I won't try it
But I think that you know
I look around and everything I see is beautiful
Cause all I see is you
And I can't deny it, and I stand by it
And I won't hide it anymore

[Chorus]
A crowded room anywhere
A million people around all I see is you there
And everything just disappears, disappears, disappears, disappears
Yeah, a million people in a crowded room
But my camera lens's only been set to zoom
And it all becomes so clear, comes so clear, becomes so clear
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision
I only see you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision
I only see you, yeah

[Verse 2]
Now that I know the truth, what am I suppose to do?
Changing up and breaking all my rules ever since we met
I'm so gone, I'm so gone, I'm so gone
Just like the movie shoot, I'm zooming in on you
Everything is extra in the background, just fades into the set
As we ride off into the sun

[Bridge]
It might seem like I’m catching something
That’s because it’s true
I can't deny it, and I won't try it
But I think that you know
I look around and everything I see is beautiful
Cause all I see is you
And I can't deny it, and I stand by it
And I won't hide it anymore!

[Chorus]
A crowded room anywhere
A million people around all I see is you there
And everything just disappears, disappears, disappears, disappears
Yeah, a million people in a crowded room
But my camera lens's only been set to zoom
And it all becomes so clear, comes so clear, becomes so clear
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision
I only see you

Everybody's looking for the fliest thing to say (Fliest thing to say)
But I just want to fly (fly away with you, you, you, you)
I don't want to be the one to alienate, yeah (Alienate)
You see, I'm trying to find an alien in you (you) if it's cool, (Cool)

[Pre-Chorus]
We can't take an airplane
Where we're going is way too high
Going where the day sky turns into night
I got the windows special tinted for the stars that get too bright
And I saved you a seat, so let's ride

[Chorus]
Hop into my spaceship coupe
There's only room for two (me and you)
And with the top down
We'll cruise around
Land and make love on the moon
(Would you like that?)
Hop into my spaceship coupe
There's only room for two (me and you)
And with the top off, you're all wrapped up
In my space lover cocoon

[Post-Chorus]
And I love it when I hear you say
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Yeah)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Sing to me
I love it when I hear you say
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Sing to me (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Now everybody knows that you're from outer space (Outer space)
But honey, I just want to turn out this space with you (You, you, you)
So drive me to your galaxy where I could play, yeah (That milky way)
And sugar, I'll take my time
And show you the backseat view, (view) if it's cool (Cool)

[Pre-Chorus]
We can't take an airplane
Where we're going is way too high
Going where the day sky turns into night
I got the windows special tinted for the stars that get too bright
And I saved you a seat, so let's ride

[Chorus 2]
Hop into my spaceship coupe
There's only room for two (And that's me and you)
And with the top down
We'll cruise around
Land and make love on the moon
Hop into my spaceship coupe
There's only room for two (Me and you)
And with the top off, you're all wrapped up
In my space lover cocoon

Hey...

Where you, and me, and all of the stars collide tonight
This is the part
Where we take off
And then we fly far away, far away, far away

[Chorus]
Hop into my spaceship coupe
There's only room for two (Me and you)

Baby, can't you see all the stars?
They shine, they shine
Just for you
I said oh, yeah, yeah
Just hop into my spaceship coupe
I saved a seat for you
Right here next to me
I'm going to take you to the moon
And I'm going to make you say
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I love it when I hear you say
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Baby, this is the part
Where you, and me, and all of the stars collide tonight
This is the part
Where we take off
And then we fly far away, far away, far away

[Verse 1]
Aren't you somethin' to admire?
'Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror
And I can't help but notice
You reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and
The glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always
Parallel on the other side

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I'll be there to pull you through
You just gotta be strong

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror staring back at me  (Oh)
I couldn't get any bigger (Oh)
With anyone else beside me (Oh)
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

[Verse 2]
Aren't you somethin', an original?
'Cause it doesn't seem merely assembled
And I can't help but stare, 'cause
I see truth somewhere in your eyes
I can't ever change without you
You reflect me, I love that about you
And if I could, I
Would look at us all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the past
I'm here tryna pull you through
You just gotta be strong

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror staring back at me (Oh)
I couldn't get any bigger (Oh)
With anyone else beside me (Oh)
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

[Bridge]
Yesterday is history, oh
Tomorrow's a mystery, oh
I can see you lookin' back at me
Keep your eyes on me
Baby, keep your eyes on me

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now (You show me, baby)
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror staring back at me (Oh)
I couldn't get any bigger (Oh)
With anyone else beside me (Oh)
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror (Oh)
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

[Post-Chorus]
Ohh (Oh oh, oh oh)
Ohh (Oh oh, oh oh)
Ohh ohh (Oh oh, oh oh)
Uhh (Oh oh, oh oh)
Ohh (Oh oh, oh oh)

[Break]
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life

[Verse 3]
Now, you're the inspiration of this precious song
And I just wanna see your face light up since you put me on
So now I say goodbye to the old me, it's already gone
And I can't wait, wait, wait, wait, wait to get you home
Just to let you know, you are

[Break]
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life

[Verse 4]
Girl, you're my reflection, all I see is you
My reflection, in everything I do
You're my reflection and all I see is you
My reflection, in everything I do

[Break]
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life

[Verse 1]
Frequencies so low
Heart on a string
A string that only plays solos
Rain made of echoes
Tidal wave rushing on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
Under the water you scream so loud but the silence surrounds you
But I hear it loud and you fall in the deep and I'll always find you

[Chorus]
If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heartbeat I'll go to the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor

[Verse 2]
Shell made out of gold
Found on a beach picked up and you held so close
Rain washed out its glow
Heartbeat steadily leads me down below

[Pre-Chorus]
Under the water you scream so loud but the silence surrounds you
But I hear it loud and you fall in the deep and I'll always find you

[Chorus]
If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heartbeat I'll go to the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor

[Bridge]
20,000 leagues away, catch up to you on the same day
Travel at the speed of light, thinking the same thoughts at the same time
Heartbeat set at steady pace, I’ll let the rhythm show me the way
No one can find us here, fade out and disappear

[Chorus]
If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heartbeat I'll go to the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor

[Verse 1]
There's a gap in between
There's a gap where we meet
Where I end and you begin
And I'm sorry for us
The dinosaurs roam the earth
The sky turns green
Where I end and you begin

[Bridge]
4, 5, 6, 7
(Get to heaven)

[Verse 2]
I am up in the clouds
I am up in the clouds
And I can't, and I can't come down
I can watch but not take part
Where I end and where you start
Where you, you left me alone
You left me alone

[Verse 3]
X will mark the place
Like the parting of the waves
Like a house falling in the sea
In the sea

[Outro]
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive

[Verse 1]
Where has my love gone?
How can I go on?
It seems dear love has gone away
Where is my spirit?
I'm nowhere near it
Oh yes, my love has gone astray

[Chorus 1]
But I'll blame it on the sun
The sun that didn't shine
I'll blame it on the wind and the trees
I'll blame it on the time that never was enough
I'll blame it on the tide and the sea
But, my heart blames it on me

[Verse 2]
Who poured the love out?
What made this bitter doubt?
Is peace not here for me to see?
Wish I could tell you
What I am feeling
But, words won't come for me to speak

[Chorus 2]
Oh, but I'll blame it on the sun
That didn't fill the sky
I'll blame it on the birds and the trees
I'll blame it on the day that ended once too soon
I'll blame it on the nights that could not be
But my heart blames it on me

[Outro]
Yeah
Mm
(Your heart blames it on you this time)

[Intro: Pitbull]
Ask for money, and get advice
Ask for advice, get money twice
I'm from the dirty, but that chico nice
Y'all call it a moment, I call it life

[Chorus: Christina Aguilera]
One day while my light is glowin'

Long ways from them hard ways
Bills, Os and oh-yays
Dade County always, 305 all day
Now, baby, we can parlay or, baby, we can party
She read books, especially about red rooms and tie-ups (Yeah)

Only difference is I own it
Now let's stop time and enjoy this moment, dale

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
I see the future but live for the moment
Make sense, don't it? Hah
Now make dollars, I mean billions (Yeah)
I'm a genius, I mean brilliant (Brilliant)
This street is what schooled him (Schooled him)
And made him slicker than Slick Rick the Ruler (Yeah)
I've lost a lot and learned a lot
But I'm still undefeated like Shula
I'm far from cheap
I break down companies with all my peeps (That's right)
Baby, we can travel the world
And what I can give you is all you can see
Time is money, only difference is I own it
Like a stopwatch, let's stop time and enjoy this moment, dale

[Chorus: Christina Aguilera & (Pitbull)]
One day while my light is glowin'
I'll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open

Whoa-oh, I just wanna feel this moment
Whoa-oh, I just wanna feel this moment

[Verse 1]
Genie let out of the bottle
It is now the witching hour
Genie let out of the bottle
It is now the witching hour
Murderers, you're murderers
We are not the same as you
Genie let out of the bottle
Funny, ha-ha, funny how

[Hook 1]
When the walls bend, when the walls bend
With your breathing, with your breathing
When the walls bend, when the walls bend
With your breathing, with your breathing
With your breathing

[Verse 2]
They will suck you down to the other side
They will suck you down to the other side
They will suck you down to the other side
They will suck you down to the other side
To the shadows blue and red, shadows blue and red
Your alarm bells, your alarm bells
Shadows blue and red, shadows blue and red
Your alarm bells, your alarm

[Hook 2]
They should be ringing, they should be ringing
They should be ringing, they should be ringing
They should be ringing, they should be ringing
They should be ringing, they should be ringing

[Outro]
They should be ringing, they should be ringing
They should be ringing, they should be ringing
This is the gloaming

[Verse 1]
In a city of the future
It is difficult to concentrate
Meet the boss, meet the wife
Everybody's happy, everyone is made for life

[Verse 2]
In a city of the future
It is difficult to find a space
I'm too busy to see you
You're too busy to wait

[Chorus]
But I'm okay, how are you?
Thanks for asking, thanks for asking
But I'm okay, how are you?
I hope you're okay, too

[Verse 3]
Every one of those days
When the sky's California blue
With a beautiful bombshell
I throw myself into my work
I'm too lazy
I've been kidding myself for so long

[Chorus]
I'm okay, how are you?
Thanks for asking, thanks for asking
I'm okay, how are you?
I hope you're okay, too

[Hook - Notorious B.I.G.]
Grew up a fuckin' screw-up
Got introduced to the game, to the game
And fuckin' blew up

[Verse 1 - Lil Wayne]
I blew up before I grew up
Got introduced to the game
Now I'm at they head like crew cuts
Suit up and lace your boots up, it's war time
It's Weezy baby, no crying, no lying
These motherfuckers is slippin', they better hold on
They trippin' like Cedric and Solange
I flow like I'm headless, no mind
I can say don't rhyme and it's gonna rhyme
I'm so fresh, I should be smacked like Dee Barnes
And you get smacked like a baseball by B. Bonds
I'm to the point, I could kill a nigga with three lines
Watch this
With, three, lines
We got that Tussin and blunts is dipped three times
We light them motherfuckers up and get tree high
And in the game I'm manning up like Eli
R.I.P B.I

[Hook]

[Interlude - Lil Wayne]
Believe that
I say, I say believe that
I got my nigga Tity Boi
Duffle bag boss
Yessir
(Weezy whats happenin')

[Verse 2 - 2 Chainz]
Gucci belt, Gucci glasses
Four door coupe and the roof no magic
Voila
So don't worry 'bout my other profession
Cause it, I send shots in the other direction
The old me the Rollie, the new me the ruby
Jacuzzi, the movies
The groupies, the two pieces
And all the animals that dearly departed
Know that my mink game is really retarted
I pumped a few packs, caught a few charges
Made a few stacks and drove a few carses
I go to the mall and buy a few closets
The rap Fernando Vargas
Got my hand on my strap
Aimed at my target
Duffle bag boy in some high-top Pradas
Get it, straight killin em'
I push weight and move pack
Duffle bag boys in the front
Young Money in the back

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Are you hungry?
Are you sick?
Are you begging for a break?
Are you sweet?
Are you fresh?
Are you strung up by the wrists?

[Hook 1]
We want the young blood

[Verse 2]
Are you fracturing?
Are you torn at the seams?
Would you do anything?
Flea-bitten, moth eaten?

[Hook 2]
We suck young blood
We suck young blood

[Verse 3]
Won't let the creeping ivy
Won't let the nervous bury me
Our veins are thin
Our rivers poisoned

[Hook 3]
We want the sweet meats
We want the young blood

[Verse 1]
When the world is on your shoulder
Gotta straighten up your act and boogie down
If you can't hang with the feelin'
Then there ain't no room for you in this part of town

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we're the party people night and day
Livin' crazy, that's the only way

[Chorus]
So tonight, gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
And just enjoy yourself
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall
Life ain't so bad at all (Live life off the wall)
Live your life off the wall (Live it off the wall)

[Verse 2]
You can shout out all you want to
'Cause there ain't no sin in folks all gettin' loud
If you take the chance and do it
Then there ain't no one who's gonna put you down

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we're the party people night and day
Livin' crazy, that's the only way

[Chorus]
So tonight, gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
And just enjoy yourself (Come on, and)
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall
Life ain't so bad at all (Live life off the wall)
Live your life off the wall (Live it off the wall)

[Bridge]
Do what you want to do
There ain't no rules, it's up to you (Ain't no rules, it's all up to you)
It's time to come alive
And party on right through the night (All right)

[Verse 3]
Gotta hide your inhibitions
Gotta let that fool loose deep inside your soul
Wanna see an exhibition (A-hee!)
Better do it now before you get too old

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we're the party people night and day
Livin' crazy, that's the only way

[Chorus]
So tonight, gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
And just enjoy yourself (Come on, and)
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall
Life ain't so bad at all (Live life off the wall)
Live your life off the wall

So tonight, gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
And just enjoy yourself (Come on, and)
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall

Tonight, gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf (Yeah)
And just enjoy yourself (Come on, and)
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all (Wanna live)

Tonight, gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf (Nine to five)
And just enjoy yourself (Come on, and)
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
You didn't come out tonight so a man could talk to you
Just wore that dress cause you knew that we'd all be watching you
You got enough cash to buy your favorite drink too
Out with the girls for the night and us guys, you give 'em the blues

[Hook]
She said ooh-woo-woo you can't do nothin' for me
You can't do nothin' for me
That's kinda rude, but I like your attitude
"It's nothing personal"
Girl, I don't take it personal, no no
Cause deep down inside those brown eyes, I'll see you
Tonight-night, at the end of the night-night
And all fuckin night-night, it's gon' be tonight-night, yeah
And when the last song plays, you'll look up
Yeah, and you'll be down, you'll be down

[Verse 2]
You see if I was another type I'da ran away from you
Off to the nearest one who woulda rolled because of who I am
So tell me your name or somethin', she said "Is it game or somethin'?"
"You pullin' the famous card, it's cute and all but not enough"

[Hook]
She said ooh-woo-woo you can't do nothin' for me
You can't do nothin' for me
That's kinda rude, but I like your attitude
"It's nothing personal"
Girl, I don't take it personal, no no
Cause deep down inside those brown eyes, I'll see you
Tonight-night, at the end of the night-night
And all fuckin night-night, it's gon' be tonight-night, yeah
I see the end of the night

[Outro]
And when the last song plays, you'll look up
Yeah, and you'll be down, you'll be down
And when the last song plays, you'll look up
Yeah, and you'll be down, you'll be down, oh

[Verse 1]
Hey baby, what you know good
I'm just getting back, but you knew I would
War is hell, when will it end?
When will people start getting together again?
Are things really getting better, like the newspaper said
What else is new my friend, besides what I read

[Verse 2]
Can't find no work, can't find no job, my friend
Money is tighter than, it's ever been
Say man, I just don't understand
What's going on across this land
Ah, what's happening brother?
Yeah, what's happening? What's happening my man?

[Verse 3]
Are they still getting down
Where we used to go and dance
Will our ball club win the pennant
Do you think, they have a chance?
And tell me friend, how in the world have you been?
Tell me, what's out and I want to know what's in

[Verse 4]
What's the deal man
What's happening? Tell me brother
What's happening brother?
Ah, what's happening brother?
What's happening my man?
Whoo, ah, ah, what's happening brother?
Say man, whoo, what's happening brother?

[Outro]
What's been shaking up and down the line?
I want to know because, I'm slightly behind the times

[Intro]
Fuck

[Verse 1]
Listen to the wind blow
Watch the sun rise
Run in the shadows
Damn your love, damn your lies

[Chorus]
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now (You don't love me now)
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying (Still hear you saying)
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)

[Verse 2]
Listen to the wind blow
Down comes the night
Run in the shadows
Damn your love, damn your lies
Break the silence
Damn the dark, damn the light

[Chorus]
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now (You don't love me now)
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying (Still hear you saying)
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now (You don't love me now)
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying (Still hear you saying)
You would never break the chain (Never break the chain)

[Guitar & Bass Solo]

[Outro]
(Chain, keep us together) Run in the shadow
(Chain, keep us together) Runnin' in the shadow
(Chain, keep us together) Runnin' in the shadow
(Chain, keep us together) Run in the shadow
(Chain, keep us together) Run in the shadow

[Intro]
Yeah, well well well, yeah-heh
Yeah, hey, hey
Ooh

[Verse 1]
Driftin' on a memory
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Than with you, yeah
Lovin' you, well, well, well

Day will make a way for night
All we'll need is candle lights
And a song, yeah
Soft and long, well, ooh

[Pre-Chorus: Ronald Isley]
Glad to be
Here alone with a lover unlike no other
Sad to see
A new horizon slowly comin' into view, yeah

[Chorus]
I wanna be living for the love of you
Ah, yes I am
All that I'm giving is for the love of you
Alright now

[Verse 2]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Lovely as a ray of sun
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
That touches me when the morning comes
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Feels good to me, yeah
My love and me (Ooh, ooh, ooh), well
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Smoother than a gentle breeze
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Flowin' through my mind with ease
Soft as can be (Ooh, ooh, ooh), well
When you're lovin' me
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
When you're lovin' me, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Love to be
Ridin' the waves of your love
Enchanted with your touch and
It seems to me
We could sail together in and out of mystery, well

[Chorus]
I wanna be living for the love of you
Alright now
All that I'm giving is for the love of you
You got me, girl
I wanna be living for the love of you
Alright now
All that I'm giving, giving, is for the love of you
Ah, yes, I am

[Verse 3]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Paradise I have within
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Can't feel insecure again
You're the key
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Well, and this I see
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh, I see
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Now and then I lose my way
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Using words that try to say
What I feel (Ooh, ooh, ooh), yeah
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Love is real
Oh, love is real, ooh

[Refrain]
I might as well
Sign my name on a card which could say it better
Time will tell
'Cause it seems that I've done just about all that I can do

[Outro]
I know that I'm living for the love of you
Oh, yes, I am
I know that I'm living for the love, love of you
Every, every day, I'm, living, for, the love of you
I'm living, for the love
Each and every day, I, I, oh oh, I
Oh, yes, I am
I wanna say it one more time
Said I'm living for the love
Each and every day, I, I, oh oh, I
Lord knows I am
Write that down
Said that I'm living for the love, love of you
Woo-hoo

[Intro]
How's it going Sesame Street?
How great is this?
The greatest

[Verse 1]
Sometimes you got a problem, the kind you can't erase
Sometimes it jumps up and slaps you in the face
Don't run around in circles, don't scream and shout
Just put your heads together and figure it out

[Hook]
Figure it out, baby figure it out
Figure it out, baby figure it out
Don't run around in circles, don't scream and don't shout
Just put your heads together and figure it out

[Verse 2]
Sometimes the problem's easy, you solve it right away
Sometimes the problem's tricky, you work it all day
But either way you think it through, that's what it's all about
You put your heads together and figure it out

[Hook] x2

[Chorus]
Baby, please stay
Don't go away, baby
Don't go away, please stay
Stay, please stay baby
Don't go away, don't go away

I'm asking you, darling
Please stay, please stay, please
Don't go away, baby
Please stay baby, please
Don't go away, no
I couldn't stand it, darling
I won't be able to sleep peacefully
In bed without you beside me darling, darling anymore
No sugar, no I won't be warm and secure
Oh baby, baby, baby, like I was before
Oh, baby
I'll just lie tossing and turning, baby, baby, baby
(Tossing and turning, tossing and turning)
All night long scared that if I closed my eyes
When I got ready to wake up I might find you gone

[Chorus]
Baby, please stay
Don't go away, baby
Don't go away, please stay
Stay, please stay baby
Don't go away, don't go away
Don't go away

[Verse 2]
For I never felt this way before
No, no sugar you did it
Oh I never felt so good, honey before
Oh I never felt so good, oh before
Oh sugar, cause you dig it, you got it
Oh I never felt so good
Oh I love you, I just love you

[Outro]
Oh now I never felt so good before

[Chorus 1]
Oh, If I should die tonight
Oh baby, though it be far before my time
I won't die blue, sugar yeah
Because I've known you

[Verse 1]
Ooh, oh, how many eyes have seen their dream?
Oh, how many arms have felt their dream?
How many hearts, darling, have felt their world stand still?

[Chorus 2]
Millions never, they never never
And millions never will baby
They never will

[Chorus 1]
If I should die tonight, love
Darling, far before my time
I won't die blue
Because I've known you

[Bridge]
Ooh, I'm so grateful baby
Grateful that you're loving me
My desire
Is to love you 'til
I'm no longer here, and never tire
Love has been so good to me, me now
I'm so thankful

[Verse 2]
Ooh, oh, how many eyes have seen their dream?
Oh, how many arms have felt their dream?
How many hearts, oh darling, have felt their world stand still?
Oh Lord

[Chorus 2]

[Intro]
Yeah, want to talk, okay
Talk about getting it on
Early morning, should talk about getting it on

[Verse 1]
You want to have, some good loving
And plenty good time
Don't just talk about it
Everybody starts getting it on

[Verse 2]
Would you rather make love children?
As opposed to war, like you know you should
Don't you want to love somebody, think about the people
Makes you feel so good, yeah come on
Don't you want somebody
Think about the good life
You got the good decision
Come on just bring it on now
What you waiting for?

[Verse 3]
Oh, Jesus, trying to tell the people
To come on and get it on, yes Lord
Ooh, get it on, oh no the nightmare
Come on, oh Lord get it on right now
Come on, you won't be so lonesome, you get it on
Get it on, lonesome body to get it

[Intro]
Girl, you've been gone away a real long time
I nearly went out of my mind
I miss your loving when you left, baby you did

[Verse 1]
Ah baby, come here, let me caress you
Ah ah baby your letters told me what you missed
Come here, sugar, and get to this
Ah baby, I want you here
I want to do something freaky to you
I want to feel what I've felt a long time ago
Ah come, baby, and get to this

[Verse 2]
Ooh, remember, baby, how you made me feel just like a king
Ah, I can’t wait, baby
I'm ready for you to start doing the things
I’m trying to blow your mind
You're so fine, so petite, oh candy sweet
Ah, I can’t wait
Come here, come here, baby, get to this

[Verse 3]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sweet love, sweet love, oh so good
To have you back, everything else will have to, to get back
Oh, nothing's changed, you're still sweet as morning rain
And I'm standing ready to
Love you, baby, make it good to you

[Bridge]
Ohhh, I need your love
Don't make me wait, I can't wait
Oh, I'm so impatient for your love
Come here, sweet sweet baby, get to this

[Outro]
Girl, I know you've been gone a real long time
You nearly blew my mind, baby
Girl, you've been gone for so long
I'm so glad, babe, so glad that you’re home, oh baby

[Chorus]
I want you—the right way
I want you
But I want you to want me too
Want you to want me, baby
Just like I want you

[Verse 1]
I give you all the love I want in return sweet darling
But half a love is all I feel
It's too bad, it's just too sad, you don't want me now
But I'm going to change your mind, someway, somehow, oh baby

[Chorus]
I want you—the right way
I want you
But I want you to want me too
I want you to want me, baby
Just like I want you

[Verse 2]
This one way love is just a fantasy, oh sugar
To share is precious, pure and fair
Don't play with something you should cherish for life, oh baby
Don't you want to care? Ain't it lonely out there?

[Chorus]
I want you—the right way
I want you
But I want you to want me too
I want you to want me, baby
When I get down with you, yes, darlin oh ooh

[Outro]
Get down baby
Have mercy
Listen precious I wanted you
A long time
I wanted you
More than you can imagine
Oh baby, so fine
I want you - the right way baby
I want you baby
But I want you to want me too baby
Gotta, gotta, gotta love me sugar
Oh, the way that I love you
Woooo, I want you

[Chorus]
Come live with me, angel
Come live with me in comfort

[Verse 1]
(I want to be your lover)
I want to understand your moods, baby
(I want to be your lover)
I really, really
(I want to be your lover)
When you want some solitude, sugar
(I want to be your lover)
You can have it, ooh yeah baby
(I want to be your lover)
Darling, please walk around nude (three times a day)
So I can get you baby
I want to intrude at least (three times a day)
In all the ways baby, whoo
You can have your way if you decide to stay
So

[Chorus]
Come live with me, angel
Come live with me in comfort

[Verse 2]
Ooh, this is where all your fantasies end
Let me explore all your treasures
I'll turn you on to all of those freakish pleasures
Good experienced company
Like me who knows all the ways
Is what you need baby
Just you and me locked up for days
After we eat breakfast in bed
Turn on the music for our head

[Chorus]
Come live with me, angel
Come live with me in comfort
Come live with me, angel
Come live with me in comfort

[Outro]
Oh, Angel, come on Go with me
Please, come on go with me
I said please
Sweet little thing
It's no mystery
How much I want you
I want you baby
I want you
I want you, can't you see?
I'll give you everything
Sweet, little sexy thing
I want you to live with me
Come on Sweet thing
Come on live with me, girl
Come on baby

[Spoken]
Do you have another J?
Yeah I want the wine, baby
Let's get naked

[Chorus]
Now we're making love
Now we're making love
Now we're making love
Where'd you get such sweet sugar?

[Verse 1]
I'll be loving you day and night
In and out, wrong or right
'Cause I want you, baby, for my wife
Oh girl, you're so divine
You're everything I've ever wanted
You're everything that's on my mind
Is it real?

[Chorus]
That we're making love
That we're making love
That we're making love
Oh, my
My, my, my, my

[Bridge]
Keep right on kissing me
When I'm kissing you
I know you know
What this is leading to
You know real soon, baby

[Verse 2]
I'll be stroking you in and out, up and down, all around
I love to hear you make those sounds
I'm gonna be loving you in and out, up and down, all around
'Cause I love to hear you make those sounds
I'ma be stroking you in and out, up and down, all around
I love to hear you, baby, make those sounds, oh-oh, ooh
I'm taking you here and there and all around the world (Oh, baby)
I love you hear you, girl, make those sounds

[Outro]
Oh, angel, ooh
Oh, you're great baby
Best in the world
Oh, I need someone
Ooh, angel, be my prayer girl
Ooh-ooh, ah, ah, ah
Oh, sugar
My love so fine
Lay with me
Lay with me, baby
I wanna be where you are
I got to be where you are
I want to be where you are
I got to be where you are

Good night, y'all
Good night, little Frankie, Nona
Night, little Marvin
I love you all
I'll always love you, Janis

I want to be where you are
Ah, I've got to be where you are, baby
Oh, my children, I'll always be where you are
(I can get love)
(I can get love)
(Don't you worry)
(I can get love)
(Just wait and see)
(Don't think about it)

I can get love
Just wait and see
Don't you worry (I can get love)
It's not just me
Don't think about it

I can get love
Just wait and see
Don't you worry (I can get love)
It's not just me
Don't think about it

I can get love
Just wait and see
Don't you worry
I can get love
It's not just me
Don't think about it
I can get love...
(Don't you worry)
(I can get love)
(It's not just me)
Don't think about it

I know I could always turn to you
Treat me so fine like you always do
I know I could always turn to you
Treat me so fine like you always do

I won't give it away

I know I could always turn to you
Treat me so fine like you always do
I know I could always turn to you
Treat me so fine like you always do

I can get love
Just wait and see
Don't you worry
I can get love
It's not just me
Don't think about it

I can get love
Just wait and see
Don't you worry
I can get love
It's not just me
Don't think about it (about it about it about it)

[Verse 1]
Oh, if you want to do it, let's get it on
But how you going to act this time around?
Before we take it off down to the skin
Let's get an understanding
Girl you didn't understand my philosophy
You did not understand
You just ran away from me
Oh I miss you baby
Oh I miss you baby, oh I miss you
You're the best I ever had
You're so bad baby, but I must like you like that
Although you won't let me control this or that
I still find you're where it's at
Ah, now I see you're coming straight to the point
You say the more you get baby, ah, the more you want me
Yeah darling you're not wasting my time
What I see baby is so hard to find
Although you've been all over town baby
Having your affairs I still have to accept you back
Angel though you're promiscuous, I don't mind a bit
Because you're still the greatest lay, even when you're miles away

[Verse 2]
Girl if you run away again
Surely my heart would never mend
Don't tell me the love we made
Was just for old times sake
Staying up waiting for you to come home at night
Was just so hard to take
She said that pain might never mend
So let's be sometime lovers
Oh, baby that's when my poor heart broke up

[Verse 3]
Well if you got a girl and you want her for your wife
You got to treat her good and love her all your life
If you got a pretty girl and you want her for your wife
You got to treat her good and love her all your life
And if you got a girl and you want her for your wife
You got to treat her good and love her all your life

[Verse 1]
Sat at the side of the pool at one of your houses
With wet white trousers on
And worlds collide as the evening continues
The dignity fucks off
Her brother's gone off to the strippers
To make up for all the lost time
She could have been one of the bitches
But she's actually alright

[Chorus]
Cigarette smoker
I'm sorry, but we're all unsure how much you've had
But we think that you ought to
Maybe not have any more

[Verse 2]
A country home, even if we really tried
Wouldn't cease to surprise us now
And I bet your dad would like to give us all a slap
When are your parents back? D'you know?
Well, I never came from no ghetto
But it wasn't nowhere near here
Well-spoken girls in stilettos
Aren't something to fear

[Chorus]
Cigarette smoker
I'm sorry, but we're all unsure how much you've had
But we think that you ought to
Maybe not have any more

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
Cigarette smoker
I'm sorry, but we're all unsure how much you've had
But we think that you ought to
Maybe not have any more

[Chorus]
Cigarette smoker
Cigarette smoke doesn't hide as well as you think
And you'd think that it ought to
Act as the perfect disguise

[Intro]
This is the story of two lovers who should have been
They did their thing and went their separate ways again
Then by chance, they met at the neighbourhood dance
And got that old feeling all over again
He said, "How much have you missed me since I had you?"

[Verse 1]
How much? (Too much, many too much)
How much? (Too much, many too much)
Ooh I really wondered, girl
Wondered if you remember baby
How good you made it to me darling
Such a thrill, but it's been so hard since I had you baby
Ah sugar, come on, give me a break
'Cause it's been so hard since I had you baby

[Verse 2]
My eyes must look serious
'Cause when I look at you, I get delirious
Your voice sounds so serious
But since we're still friends
Let me make love to you again, baby

[Bridge]
Don't make me wait
Been so hard since I had your sugar
Don't make me wait
Been so hard since I had you baby

[Verse 3]
Big Daddy Rucker is sho 'nuff gettin' down
Ahhh, this is a mellow dance
Oh, baby its been such a long time
Remember when I used to do this to you?
Come on, let this be the last dance

[Outro]
Since I had you girl, I haven't wanted no other lover
Since I had you honey, there hasn't been no other woman, nah nah baby
Since I had you baby, there hasn't been no other woman, ahh
Since I taste your loving, I haven't seen no other woman, I wanna love you
Since I had you baby, there hasn't been no other woman
You might believe it, but since I had you baby there hasn't been no other woman, aow

[Verse 1]
I was biting the time zone
And we embellished the banks of our bloodstreams
And threw caution to the colourful
Then we fell asleep in the car
Until the bumps woke me up in your grip
And the tide took me to your mouth
And then swept me back down to your palms
It's them that put me inside the reminder
That yours is the only ocean

[Chorus]
Yours is the only ocean
That I wanna swing from
Yours is the only ocean
That I wanna hang on

[Verse 2]
I've got this ego mechanic
She's always trying to give me vitamins
Ah, she'd be frightened of your reflection
I preferred her as a cartoon
If I could be someone else for a week
I'd spend it chasing after you
'Cause she's not shattering my attitudes
No matter how she folds the potion
Yours is the only ocean

[Chorus]
Yours is the only ocean
That I wanna swing from
Yours is the only ocean
That I want to hang on to

[Bridge]
Potion approaching, shield your eyes
Potion approaching, visualise
Holding a token, swollen in size
Potion approaching, shield your eyes

[Outro]
Oh, but if we're gonna escape though
We really ought to think it through
Would you like me to build you a go-kart?

[Verse 1]
Fiendish wonder in a carnival's wake
Dull caresses once again irritate
Tread softly, stranger
Move over toward the danger that you seek
You think excitement has receded then the mirror distracts
The logic of the trance quickly reaches and grasps
Handsome and faceless
And weightless, your imagination runs

[Chorus]
And now it's no one's fault but yours
At the foot of the house of cards
You thought you'd never get obsessed
You thought the wolves would be impressed
And you're a sinking stone
But you know what it's like to hold the jeweller's hands
That procession of pioneers all drowned

[Verse 2]
In the moonlight they're more thrilling, those things that he knows
As he leads you through the grinning bubble blowers in the snow
Watching his exit
Was like falling off the ferry in the night
The inevitables gather to push you around
Any other voice makes such a punishing sound
He became laughter's assassin
Shortly after he showed you what it was

[Chorus]
And now it's no one's fault but yours
At the foot of the house of cards
You thought you'd never get obsessed
You thought the wolves would be impressed
And you're a sinking stone
But you know what it's like to hold the jeweller's hands
That procession of pioneers all drowned

[Outro]
If you've a lesson to teach me
I'm listening, ready to learn
There's no one here to police me
I'm sinking in until the return
If you've a lesson to teach
Please don't deviate, don't be afraid
Without the last corner piece, I can't calibrate
Let's get it ingrained
If you've a lesson to teach me
I'm listening, ready to learn
There's no one here to police me
I'm sinking in until the return
If you've a lesson to teach
Please don't deviate, don't be afraid
Without the last corner piece, I can't calibrate
Let's get it ingrained
If you've a lesson to teach me
I'm listening, ready to learn
There's no one here to police me
I'm sinking in until the return
If you've a lesson to teach
Please don't deviate, don't be afraid
Without the last corner piece, I can't calibrate
Let's get it ingrained

[Verse 1]
So let me tell you 'bout last Saturday night, the club was rocking
Super freaks hanging out wall to wall
They tell me something's going on in the men's room
Soon as we come out we'll be high soon
Did you save a line for the ladies?
We're not into that are you crazy
Who's the super freak in the red dress?
When she starts to shake it, I can't take it
Get in the groove and boogie to the beat baby
Get in the groove and boogie to the beat baby
Shake it baby, shake ya titties
We got the party, we got the sounds
We're off in the streets and all the freaks are getting down
Get in the groove baby, and boogie to the beat
Shake, shake your thing

[Bridge]
You freaky thing, the way you move you drive me crazy
You freaky thing, you freaky thing
You freaky thing, the way you move you drive me crazy
You make me rock, you make me rock
You freaky thing, the way you move you drive me crazy
You freaky thing, you freaky thing
You turn me on, the way you dance, the way you dance
Midnight lady, sexy dancer
Hot and hardy, love to party
Check it out

[Verse 2]
We're jamming to love
Major love, minor love
Jamming to a great crescendo
Let's party baby, shake it, shake it
Party night to remember
Oh, everybody's having fun
Come on and party turn the green light on
When I saw you, I had to stop
I had to stop in the middle of a bop
I had to stop, I got the rhythm
I got the rhythm
Love is everywhere for the making
Freaks is everywhere for the taking
Blues is in the air if you sing it
Happiness come back if you bring it
I'm having me a good time

[Bridge]
Midnight lady, midnight lady
Rocking and finger popping
Somebody said you was a super freak
I'm here to tell you I'm a super freak baby
Get in the groove
Get in the groove
Get in the groove
We got to rock, we got the rhythm
We got to come on down to the boogie
Feeling good

[Outro]
Check that classy rhythm
Give me that sexy beat
I dig that feeling jam
Midnight lady, sexy
You are the one I'm looking for
I never, never, never knew before
Oh, baby, you're looking too good
Super freaky

[Verse 1]
Shattered dreams
Worthless years
Here am I encased inside a hollow shell
Life began
Then was done
Now I stare into a cold and empty well

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The many sounds that meet our ears
The sights our eyes behold
Will open up our merging hearts
And feed our empty souls

[Chorus 1]
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
I believe when I fall in love this time
It will be forever

[Verse 2]
Without despair
We will share
And the joys of caring will not be replaced
What has been
Must never end
And with the strength we have won't be erased

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When the truths of love are planted firm
They won't be hard to find
And the words of love I speak to you
Will echo in my mind

Mm

[Chorus 3]
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
I believe when I fall in love this time
It will be forever

Ever, ever, ever, ever
Ow!

I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever

I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
(I'm so glad that I found someone to believe in again)
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
(I'm so glad that I found someone to believe in again)
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
(I'm so glad that I found someone to believe in again)
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
(I'm so glad that I found someone to believe in again)
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
(I'm so glad that I found someone to believe in again)
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
(I'm so glad that I found someone to believe in again)
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
(I'm so glad that I found someone to believe in again)
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
(I'm so glad that I found someone to believe in again)

I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
(I'm so glad that I found someone to believe in again)
I believe when I fall in love with you
It will be forever
(I'm so glad that I found someone to believe in again)

["Let's fall in love" part until fade-out]
Come on, let's fall in love
You're the woman I've been waiting for
Come on, let's fall in love
You're the girl that I really adore
Come on, let's fall in love
(Don't you wanna, don't you wanna, don't you wanna fall in love with me?)
Come on, baby, let's fall in love
Come on, let's fall in love
(Don't you wanna, don't you wanna, don't you wanna fall in love with me?)
You're the baby I've been thinking for
Yeah, oh yeah, uh-uh
(Don't you wanna, don't you wanna, don't you wanna fall in love with me?)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
(Don't you wanna, don't you wanna, don't you wanna fall in love with me?)

[Intro]
...we came in?

[Verse: Roger Waters]
So ya thought ya might like to go to the show
To feel the warm thrill of confusion, that space cadet glow
Tell me, is something eluding you, sunshine?
Is this not what you expected to see?
If you wanna find out what's behind these cold eyes
You'll just have to claw your way through this disguise

[Bridge: Roger Waters]
Lights!
Roll the sound effects!
Action!
Drop it, drop it on 'em
Drop it, drop it on them!
*Airplane descending*

[Outro]
*Baby Crying*

[Intro]
*Baby Crying*

[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
Momma loves her baby
And Daddy loves you too
And the sea may look warm to you, babe
And the sky may look blue
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, babe
Ooh-ooh-ooh, baby blue
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, babe

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
If you should go skating
On the thin ice of modern life
Dragging behind you, the silent reproach
Of a million tear stained eyes
Don't be surprised when a crack in the ice
Appears under your feet
You'll slip out of your depth and out of your mind
With your fear flowing out behind you
As you claw the thin ice

[Verse: Roger Waters]
Daddy's flown across the ocean
Leaving just a memory
A snapshot in the family album
Daddy, what else did you leave for me?
Daddy, what'd ya leave behind for me?
All in all, it was just a brick in the wall
All in all, it was all just bricks in the wall

[Outro: Roger Waters]
Hey!
*Children playing*

[Intro: Roger Waters]
You! Yes, you! Stand still, laddie!

[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
When we grew up and went to school
There were certain teachers who
Would hurt the children in any way they could (Oof!)
By pouring their derision upon anything we did
Exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kid

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
But in the town, it was well known, when they got home at night
Their fat and psychopathic wives would thrash them within inches of their lives

[Spoken Intro: Harry Waters]
Look, Mummy!
There's an airplane up in the sky

[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Did-did-did-did you see the frightened ones?
Did-did-did-did you hear the falling bombs?
Did-did-did-did you ever wonder why we had to run for shelter when the promise of a brave new world unfurled beneath the clear blue sky?

[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Did-did-did-did you see the frightened ones?
Did-did-did-did you hear the falling bombs?
The flames are all long gone
But the pain lingers on

[Outro: David Gilmour]
Goodbye, blue sky
Goodbye, blue sky
Goodbye
Goodbye

[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
(Ah) I am just a new boy
A stranger in this town
Where are all the good times?
Who's gonna show this stranger around?

[Chorus: David Gilmour & Roger Waters]
Ooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooh, I need a dirty girl

[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
Will some woman in this desert land
Make me feel like a real man?
Take this rock-and-roll refugee
Ooh, baby, set me free

[Chorus: David Gilmour & Roger Waters]
Ooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooh, I need a dirty girl

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus: David Gilmour & Roger Waters]
Ooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooh, I need a dirty girl

[Outro]
*Phone beeping*
"Hello?"
"Yes, a collect call for Mrs. Floyd from Mr. Floyd. Will you accept the charge from the United States?"
*Phone clicks*
"Oh, he hung up. That's your residence, right? Well, I wonder why he hung up. Is there supposed to be someone out there besides your wife there to answer?"
*Phone redials and beeps again*
"Hello?"
"This is the United States calling. Are we reaching..."
*Phone clicks*
"See, he keeps hanging up, and it's a man answering."

[Intro]
"Oh my God! What a fabulous room! Are all these your guitars?"
("I'm sorry sir, I didn't mean to startle you")
"God! This place is bigger than our apartment!"
("Let me know when you're entering a room")
("Yes, sir")
"Um, can I get a drink of water?"
("I was wondering about")
"You want some, huh?"
("Yes")
"Oh wow! Hey, look at this tub! Wanna take a bath?"
("I'll have to find out from Mrs. Bancroft what time she wants to meet us, for her main")
"What are you watching?"
("If you'll just let me know as soon as you can, Mrs. Bancroft... Mrs. Bancroft")
"Hello?"
("I don't understand")
"Are you feeling okay?"

[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
Day after day, the love turns gray
Like the skin of the dying man
And night after night, we pretend it's all right
But I have grown older, and you have grown colder
And nothing is very much fun any more
And I can feel one of my turns coming on
I feel cold as a razor blade, tight as a tourniquet
Dry as a funeral drum

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
Run to the bedroom, in the suitcase on the left
You'll find my favourite axe
Don't look so frightened, this is just a passing phase
One of my bad days
Would you like to watch TV? Or get between the sheets?
Or contemplate the silent freeway?
Would you like something to eat? Would you like to learn to fly?
Would ya? Would you like to see me try?
Ah, no!

[Outro: Roger Waters]
Would you like to call the cops?
Do you think it's time I stopped?
Why are you running away?

[Hook: Roger Waters]
Ooh, babe, don't leave me now

[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
Don't say it's the end of the road
Remember the flowers I sent
I need you, babe
To put through the shredder in front of my friends

[Hook: Roger Waters]
Oh, babe, don't leave me now

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
How could you go?
When you know how I need you
(Need you, need you, need you, need you, need you, need you)
To beat to a pulp on a Saturday night

[Hook: Roger Waters]
Oh, babe, don't leave me now

[Verse 3: Roger Waters]
How can you treat me this way?
Running away
Ooh, babe, why are you running away?

[Outro: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
Ooh, babe
Ooh, babe
Ooh, babe
Ooh, ooh
Argh!

[Intro]
*Sounds from TV*

[Verse: Roger Waters]
I don't need no arms around me
And I don't need no drugs to calm me
I have seen the writing on the wall
Don't think I need anything at all
No, don't think I'll need anything at all

[Chorus: Roger Waters]
All in all, it was all just bricks in the wall
All in all, you were all just bricks in the wall

[Verse 1]
Hello
You know, you look even better
Than the way you did the night before
And the moment that you kiss my lips
You know, I start to feel wonderful
It's something incredible
There's sex in your chemicals, oh
Ooh, let's go
You're the best way I know
To escape the extraordinary
This world ain't for you
And I know for damn sure this world ain't for me
Lift off and say goodbye
Just let your fire set me free

[Chorus]
Oh, moonshine
Take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time

[Verse 2]
I know
I was with you last night
But it feels like it's been so long
And everybody that's around
They notice that I'm not myself when you're gone
It's good to see you again
Good to see you again
On top of the world
Is where I stand when you're back in my life
Life's not so bad when you're way up this high
Everything is alright
Everything is alright

[Chorus]
Oh, moonshine
Take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time
Oh, moonshine
Your loving makes me come alive
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time

[Bridge]
Don't look down, don't you never look back
We are not afraid to die young and live fast
Give me good times, give me love, give me laughs
Let's take a ride to the sky before the night is gone

[Chorus]
Moonshine
Take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time
Oh, moonshine
Your loving makes me come alive
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time

[Intro]
"Well, only got an hour of daylight left. Better get started"
"Isn't it unsafe to travel at night?"
"It'll be a lot less safe to stay here. Your father's gonna pick up our trail before long"
"Can Lorca ride?"
"He'll have to ride. Lorca, time to go! Chengra, thank you for everything. Let's go."
"Goodbye, Chengra"
"Goodbye, Missy!"
"I'll be back--one day"

[Refrain: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody out there?
Ah, is there anybody out there?

[Instrumental Outro]

[Intro]
"But there's somebody else that needs taking care of in Washington..."
"Who's that?"
"Rose Pilchitt!"
"Rose Pilchitt? Who's that?"
*Kid screams in background*
(Shut up!)
"36-24-36 *Laughs* does that answer your question?"
(Oi! I've got a little black book with me poems in!)
"Who's she?"
"She was 'Miss Armoured Division' in 1961... "

[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
I've got a little black book with my poems in
Got a bag with a toothbrush and a comb in
When I'm a good dog they sometimes throw me a bone in
I got elastic bands keeping my shoes on
Got those swollen hand blues
I've got thirteen channels of shit on the T.V. to choose from
I've got electric light
And I've got second sight
I've got amazing powers of observation

[Chorus 1: Roger Waters]
And that is how I know
When I try to get through
On the telephone to you
There will be nobody home

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
I've got the obligatory Hendrix perm
And the inevitable pinhole burns
All down the front of my favourite satin shirt
I've got nicotine stains on my fingers
I've got a silver spoon on a chain
I've got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains
I've got wild staring eyes
And I've got a strong urge to fly
But I've got nowhere to fly to (Fly to... fly to... fly to...)

[Chorus 2: Roger Waters]
Ooh, babe, when I pick up the phone
("Surprise, surprise, surprise...")
There's still nobody home

[Outro: Roger Waters]
I've got a pair of Gohills boots
And I've got fading roots

[Chorus: Jim Gilstrap & Lani Groves]
You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always be around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart

[Verse 1: Stevie Wonder]
I feel like this is the beginning
Though I've loved you for a million years
And if I thought our love was ending
I'd find myself drowning in my own tears

[Chorus: Stevie Wonder]
You are the sunshine of my life, yeah
That's why I'll always stay around, mmm-mmm, yeah-yeah
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart

[Verse 2: Stevie Wonder]
You must have known that I was lonely
Because you came to my rescue
And I know that this must be heaven
How could so much love be inside of you?

[Chorus: Stevie Wonder]
You are the sunshine of my life, yeah
That's why I'll always stay around, mmm (Baby)
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart

[Verse 1]
I'm feeling down and some kind of lonely
Cause' my baby done left me here
Heart's blazing like a five alarm fire
And I don't even give a care
I feel like the world is turning on me
My dreams turning to ashes right in front of my face
And I'm getting kind of worried
And I feel so out of place

[Hook]
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
Maybe your baby done made some other plans

[Background] . . I feel like cryin', yeh, yeh
Maybe baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

[Verse 2]
In the morning when I've got heartache
I can't call up the doctor for help
'Cause the only person that could ever do me any good
Is stepping out with my best friend
I feel like I'm slipping deeper
Slipping deeper into myself
And I can't take it
This stuff is scaring me to death

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Little Sally Walker, sitting in a saucer
Checking out the guys that are passing by

[Background]...by, by, by, by...

[Hook]
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
Your baby, your baby, stupid baby, your baby
That you put so trust so much trust in your baby
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
Your baby, your baby, stupid baby, your baby
That you put so trust so much trust in your baby
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
Maybe your baby done made some other plans
Maybe your baby done made some other plans

[Verse 1]
Here we are on earth together, it's you and I
God has made us fall in love, it's true
I've really found someone like you
Will it stay, the love you feel for me?
Will it say, that you will be by my side?
To see me through until my life is through

[Hook 1]
Well, in my mind, we can conquer the world
In love you and I, you and I, you and I

[Verse 2]
I am glad at least in my life I found someone
That may not be here forever to see me through
But I found strength in you
I only pray that I have shown you a brighter day
Because that's all that I am living for, you see
Don't worry what happens to me

[Hook 2]
'cause in my mind, you will stay here always
In love, you and I, you and I, you and I, you and I
In my mind we can conquer the world
In love, you and I, you and I, you and I
You and I

[Intro]
"Where the hell are you?
"Where the hell are you, Simon?" *Shots*

[Verse: Roger Waters]
Does anybody here remember Vera Lynn?
Remember how she said that
We would meet again some sunny day?
Vera, Vera, what has become of you?
Does anybody else in here feel the way I do?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When you believe in a feeling
And it's holding you back from my love
Then you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl

[Chorus 1]
When you insist on excluding
The tenderness that's in my kiss
Then you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl

[Verse 1]
If you try to display an emotion that will contradict itself
You will find your heart just sitting
Like a statue on a shelf, on a shelf, on a shelf

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Should you depend on an outlet
Through which an escape can be found
Then you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl

[Chorus 2]
If you don't see there's no way out
Just no way of getting around me
Then you've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl

[Verse 2]
Yes, you know the plans I am making are intended to capture you
So you practice false reactions to delay the things I do
The things I do, things I do, foolish you
You've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl
You've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl

[Bridge]
There's no reward in detouring, my deep sincerity
Especially since what you're feeling
Is perfectly clear to me, clear to me, clear to me

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Before you discover the feeling
You've tried very hard to hide
You've got it bad girl, you've got it bad girl

[Chorus 3]
But when you can find just a small space
To let my love live in your mind
Then you'll have it good girl, you'll have it good girl

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Whoop
Whoop
Ladies and gentlemen
This is Macadelic
You motherfucker, hahahaha

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Uh
I got codeine in my cup, you can bet your ass I'm sippin'
Groupies fall in love, I'm like, "Bitch, you must be trippin'"
I'm just tryna fuck and she just need tuition
Why you tryna stunt, you need to play your own position
Never gave a fuck, yeah, nothin' 'bout me changed
Still roll up them blunts, got diamonds in my chain, haha
Yeah, you heard me I got diamonds in my chain
And it don't make a difference if you cryin' in the rain
Two hundred shows, I'ma kill more, I just sold out that Fillmore
Got a million, make a mill' more, then a number one spot on the Billboard

[Refrain: Mac Miller]
Yeah, people lie, numbers won't, keep me high, drugs is close
Roll one up, pour a cup, watch the world go up in smoke

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I like my music real loud, real loud
Can you turn that shit up for me right now, right now?
Here it come, there it go, ask your homies, ask your hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low
I like my music real loud, real loud
Can you turn that shit up for me right now, right now?
Here she comes, there she goes, never chasin' after hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low

[Verse 2: Benny Banks]
I got weed up in my rizla, you can bet your life I'm smokin'
I'll be tokin' 'til I'm chokin', I'm forever puffin' potent
Take your girlfriend right up off you, go report that bitch, she stolen
I dig deep up in that pussy 'til her leg drops like Hulk Hogan's
I'm the realest ever livin', most these other rappers bogus
I got money for a mortgage, this time last year I was homeless
I get Ps, the broke don't like it, see me comin' and the rich get frightened
This is my mouth, I ain't ever gonna mind it, lost my mind, maybe I don't wanna find it
I make them hate, haters gon' hate, A-B-C, I'm all about cake
Born and raised, I ain't ever gon' change, I'll still take the food off your plate
You can call me the great white Hulk, came and I leave and I take shit home
Got her mad at me, can't do it on my own, now they gotta watch while the world go up in smoke

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I like my music real loud, real loud
Can you turn that shit up for me right now, right now?
Here it come, there it go, ask your homies, ask your hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low
I like my music real loud, real loud
Can you turn that shit up for me right now, right now?
Here she comes, there she goes, never chasin' after hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
Argh
I'ma get that Grammy soon, fuck your magazine
Jordan gonna hand me shoes, still fuck your magazine
Hammer team in that pack with me, hear the Jerm beat banging, with a glass of lean
When I went to every high school class would be tryna fuck the female faculty
I'm a crazy little fucker, think my head done ran away
I experiment with drugs but I won't ever fuck with yay'
I just made a million dollars, still I think I'm underpaid
Fuck with me? Kid no way, when you meet me, bitch stand up straight
Pump out raps, yeah, I got raps, tryna talk shit, what you think about that?
For the pesos, getting bank roll, I'ma lay low, chill, 'til I let that stack

[Refrain: Mac Miller]
Yeah, people lie, numbers won't, keep me high, drugs is close
Roll one up, pour a cup, watch the world go up in smoke

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I like my music real loud, real loud
Can you turn that shit up for me right now, right now?
Here it come, there it go, ask your homies, ask your hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low
I like my music real loud, real loud
Can you turn that shit up for me right now, right now?
Here she comes, there she goes, never chasin' after hoes
If you didn't, now you know, never keep your pockets low

[Verse: Roger Waters]
Bring the boys back home
Bring the boys back home
Don't leave the children on their own, no, no
Bring the boys back home

[Outro]
"Wrong, do it again!"
*Knock* "Time to go!"
"Are you feeling okay?"
"He keeps hanging up, and it's a man answering!"
"Hahahahaha!!!!!!"
Is there anybody out there?

[Chorus 1]
Your name is big brother
You say that you're watching me on the telly
Seeing me go nowhere
Your name is big brother
You say that you're tired of me protesting
Children dying everyday
My name is nobody
But I can't wait to see your face inside my door

[Chorus 2]
Your name is big brother
You say that you got me all in your notebook
Writing it down everyday
Your name is I'll see ya
I'll change if you vote me in as the pres
The President of your soul
I live in the ghetto
You just come to visit me 'round election time

[Bridge]
I live in the ghetto
Someday I will move on my feet to the other side

[Verse 1]
My name is secluded
We live in a house the size of a matchbox
Roaches live with us wall to wall

[Verse 2]
You've killed all our leaders
I don't even have to do nothing to you
You'll cause your own country to fall

[Verse 1]
Never tears or sorrows came before me in my mind
I had no problems, never a problem in my life
Never a worry on my mind
All my days before today were happy
And secure until your phone call
You were telling me goodbye

[Chorus 1]
Now I'm looking for another love
I'm looking for another pure love in my life
And I'm looking for another love
I'm looking for another pure love in my life

[Guitar solo: Jeff Beck]

[Verse 2]
Now the wheel of fate has turned
I'm worried 'bout the new love you've discovered
He is a problem in my life
I have a problem on my mind
Things you cherish most in your life
Can be taken if they're left neglected
Leaving a problem in your life

[Chorus 2]
'Cause now I'm looking for another love
I'm looking for another pure love in my life
And now I'm looking for another love
And now I'm looking for another love
I'm looking for another pure love in my life
I'm looking for another love
I'm looking for another pure love in my life

[Intro: David Gilmour]
(Ah-ah) Ooh, ooh-hoo, ooh, ooh
(Ah-ah)
(Ah-ah)
(Ooh-ma, ah, ooh-pa) Must the show go on?
(Ooh-pa, take me home, take me home, take me home)
(Ooh-ma, let me go, let me go, let me go)

[Verse: David Gilmour]
There must be some mistake, I didn't mean to let them
Take away my soul, am I too old, is it too late?
(Ooh-ma, ooh-pa) Where has the feeling gone?
(Ooh-ma, ooh-pa) Will I remember the song?

[Outro: David Gilmour]
(Ooh, ooh, ah) The show must go on

[Chorus: David Gilmour & Roger Waters]
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run

[Verse 1: David Gilmour, Roger Waters]
You better make your face up with your favourite disguise
With your button down lips and your roller blind eyes
With your empty smile and your hungry heart
Feel the bile rising from your guilty past
With your nerves in tatters as the cockleshell shatters
And the hammers batter down your door
You better run!

[Chorus: David Gilmour & Roger Waters]
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run

[Verse 2: David Gilmour, Roger Waters]
You better run all day and run all night
And keep your dirty feelings deep inside
And if you're taking your girlfriend out tonight
You better park the car well out of sight
'Cause if they catch you in the back seat trying to pick her locks
They're gonna send you back to Mother in a cardboard box
You better run!

[Synth Solo]

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse: Roger Waters]
I wanna go home
Take off this uniform and leave the show
But I'm waiting in this cell, because I have to know
(Have to know, have to know...)
Have I been guilty all this time?
(Have to know, have to know, have to know, have to know...)
(Time, time, time, time...)

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1: Prosecutor]
Good morning, Worm your honour
The crown will plainly show the prisoner
Who now stands before you
Was caught red-handed showing feelings
Showing feelings of an almost human nature
This will not do
Call the schoolmaster!

[Verse 2: The Schoolmaster]
I always said he'd come to no good in the end your honour
If they'd let me have my way I could have flayed him into shape
But my hands were tied, the bleeding hearts and artists
Let him get away with murder, let me hammer him today

[Chorus 1: Pink (and Choir)]
Crazy, toys in the attic
I am crazy, truly gone fishing
They must have taken my marbles away!
(Crazy, toys in the attic, he is crazy)

[Verse 3: Wife]
You little shit, you're in it now, I hope they throw away the key
You should have talked to me more often than you did, but no!
You had to go your own way
Have you broken any homes up lately?
"Just five minutes, Worm your honour, him and me, alone"

[Verse 4: Mother]
Babe!
Come to mother baby, let me hold you in my arms
M'lud I never wanted him to get in any trouble
Why'd he ever have to leave me?
Worm, your honour, let me take him home

[Chorus 2: Pink (and Choir)]
Crazy, over the rainbow
I am crazy, bars in the window
There must have been a door there in the wall
When I came in
(Crazy, over the rainbow, he is crazy)

[Verse 5: The Judge]
The evidence before the court is incontrovertible
There's no need for the jury to retire
In all my years of judging, I have never heard before
Of someone more deserving of the full penalty of law
The way you made them suffer, your exquisite wife and mother
Fills me with the urge to defecate
(Go on, Judge, shit on him!)
Since, my friend, you have revealed your deepest fear
I sentence you to be exposed before your peers
Tear down the wall!

[Outro: Crowd]
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!

*explosion*
*bricks crumbling*

[Verse 1]
You say you want your own life, well I do, too
You wanna lead me on?
Oh, well I'll show you
Come on girls, march it out
Show him what you're all about
Whoopin', burn the house down, show him who's the leader
Bring ya baby down, down
Go cheerleaders!

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I'm a gangster too and it takes two to tango
You don't wanna dance with me, dance with me
Honey, I'm in love with you, if you don't feel the same
Boy, you don't wanna mess with me, mess with me

[Chorus]
Why, cause I'm a jealous, jealous, jealous girl
If I can't have you baby, if I can't have you baby
Jealous, jealous, jealous girl
If I can't have you baby, no one else in this world can
(Bring ya baby down down, go cheerleader!)

[Verse 2]
You say you got your own life, good for you
You got more important things to do
Come on girls, say it loud, tell him that it's over now
Whoop! You're not off the hook, ya deceiver
I know whatcha done, done, sing cheerleader

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I'm a gangster too and it takes two to tango
You don't wanna dance with me, dance with me
Honey, I'm in love with you, if you don't feel the same
Boy, you don't wanna mess with me, mess with me

[Chorus]
Why, cause I'm a jealous, jealous, jealous girl
If I can't have you baby, if I can't have you baby
Jealous, jealous, jealous girl
If I can't have you baby, no one else in this world can
(Bring ya baby down down, go cheerleader!)

[Bridge]
Be aggressive, B-E aggressive
I said, be aggressive, B-E aggressive
B-E A-G-G-R-E-S-S-I-V-E
Whoopin' the house down, show him who's the leader
Bring ya' baby down, down, go cheerleader!
(If I can't have you, baby)
You should be my man
(If I can't have you, baby)
No one's better than I am
(If I can't have you, baby)
C'mon give it to me, bam
If I can't have you baby, no one else in this world can

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I'm a gangster too and it takes two to tango
You don't wanna dance with me, dance with me
Honey, I'm in love with you, if you don't feel the same
Boy, you don't wanna mess with me, mess with me

[Chorus]
Why, cause I'm a jealous, jealous, jealous girl
If I can't have you baby, if I can't have you baby
Jealous, jealous, jealous girl
If I can't have you baby, no one else in this world can
(Bring ya baby down down, go cheerleader!)

Why, cause I'm a jealous, jealous, jealous girl
If I can't have you baby, if I can't have you baby
Jealous, jealous, jealous girl
If I can't have you baby, no one else in this world can
(Bring ya baby down down, go cheerleader!)

[Verse]
All alone, or in twos
The ones who really love you
Walk up and down, outside the wall
Some hand in hand
And some gathered together in bands
The bleeding hearts and the artists make their stand
And when they've given you their all
Some stagger and fall, after all it's not easy
Banging your heart against some mad bugger's wall

[Outro]
Isn't this where...

[Chorus]
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them just for one day
We can be heroes just for one day

[Verse 1]
And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time
'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes, we're lovers, and that is that

[Refrain]
Though nothing will keep us together
We could steal time just for one day
We can be heroes forever and ever
What d'you say?

[Verse 2]
I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim

[Refrain]
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them forever and ever
Oh, we can be heroes just for one day

[Chorus]
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be heroes, just for one day
We can be us just for one day

[Verse 3]
I, I can remember (I remember)
Standing by the wall (By the wall)
And the guns shot above our heads (Over our heads)
And we kissed as though nothing could fall (Nothing could fall)

[Refrain]
And the shame was on the other side
Oh, we can beat them forever and ever
Then we could be heroes just for one day

[Bridge]
We can be heroes
We can be heroes
We can be heroes just for one day
We can be heroes

[Outro]
We're nothing, and nothing will help us
Maybe we're lying, then you better not stay
But we could be safer just for one day
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, just for one day

[Verse 1]
Looking out on the morning rain
I used to feel so uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord, it made me feel so tired
Before the day I met you
Life was so unkind
And you're the key to my peace of mind

[Chorus]
'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
(Woman)

[Verse 2]
When my soul was in the lost and found
You came along to claim it
I didn't know just what was wrong with me
Till your kiss helped me name it
Now I'm no longer doubtful of what I'm living for
And if I make you happy, I don't need to do more

[Chorus]
'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
(Woman)

[Verse 3]
Oh baby, what you've done to me (What you've done to me)
You made me feel so good inside (Good inside)
And I just wanna be (Wanna be)
Close to you, you make me feel so alive

[Chorus]
You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
(Woman)
You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman
(Woman)
You make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel like a natural woman

[Intro]
Life moves pretty fast
You don't stop and look around once in a while you could miss it

[Verse 1: Ka.lil (aka Khingz) of Abyssinian Creole]
Look, I've been away from my city, the city's changes ain't pretty
Babies still playing in ditchy forgotten corners
The city's forgotten its warriors
Who died young
Eyes hating the sun that's shining before us
How rotten bodies fertilizing the forest of concrete and glass
Foul hearted police aiming their gats
My head hang over beats
I hope my ghosts stay in the past
And days I couldn't play to the pad
We the same kids they'd be sending to invade Iraq
And "make it safe" with crack
I got that Gray Goose and OJ in a glass
The last day before my cousin hit the pen
Down to swing
I came back to the town just to be down with the king
And loving surroundings it seems
Just then he find out his baby cousin fell off a balcony
Images of a violent paradise is drowning me
Lost souls and I can't let go or tell no
The same scenario that rules South Othello
Black, Browns and yellow
Southsiders tell the devil "hello"
And heaven "bye"
And it hurts too much to ask why

[Hook: Abyssinian Creole]
From the places with plenty
To the space with no pity
The forces changing our city
One day at a time
If I don't change what's been given
What can I say to my children
Who gonna be claiming this city
One day...

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I grew up on Capitol Hill
With two parents and two cars
They had a beautiful marriage
We even had a swing set in our yard
My mom didn't have a job, because my dad made enough
Money that we could live comfortably and he could support us
Now, he'd commute to Tacoma, so we knew we'd be good
But then I realized everybody looked just like me in my neighborhood
I'd go to school, which was diverse
But indeed us, I got sandwiches and Capri-Sun's
And my friends ate the free lunch
It's crazy trying to look back, cause when I was growing up
I didn't understand the fact was
There's something called a social status
And my black friends weren't in my financial bracket
And then my city's divided
From neighborhood to neighborhood
We're polarized but we claim that we're progressive
The police shoot in the hood but never once in my residence
Has a white person been shot or even stopped in a Lexus?
And to think that we claim that so much has changed
Since Brown versus the Board of Education and Roe versus Wade
But around my way it all stays the same
They just figured out a way to separate the black and white face

[Hook]
From the places with plenty
To the space with no pity
The forces changing our city
One day at a time
If I don't change what's been given
What can I say to my children
Who gonna be claiming this city
One day...
From the places with plenty
To the space with no pity
The forces changing our city
One day at a time
If I don't change what's been given
What can I say to my children
Who gonna be claiming this city
One day...

[Verse 3: Gabriel Teodros of Abyssinian Creole]
Say it's the richest city in the world, right?
Images of Tent City in the shadows of Amazon's office site
In the jungle down the slide in Jose Rizal's park
There's this part in the gate, with a trail to a place over I-5
Where families survive, most my early life we've known about it
Called development? They kicked them folks out
And moved them around every chance they can since
So scared of homelessness, but ignoring them ain't gonna change it
And tearing down the 'jects ain't gonna make your ass safer
For all that paper wasted just to build up Safeco
While Garfield High School still remains like a slave boat
We gave up on hope, a long time ago, so
I wake on this floor, after pacing hours before
Mind racing like a child torn in war zones
With every side challenged
Needing to manage and understand this balance
I can't fall or falter
Brother, I'm just an author
And no amount of words offered has ever been enough to alter this system
Swallowing souls broke
My own folks roam upcoast
Holding dreams close of what America was supposed to be
But works for the rich only
This Southend in reality
Took my family back to what they was running from before
When they left that war
Same shit, different continent
Home don't exist anymore
Home don't exist anymore
The 206 that raised me just ain't the same, yo

[Sample]
All those moments
All those moments
All those moments will be lost, in time
Like tears in rain

[Intro: Prodigy]
Yeah, yeah
(Check me out) That's right
(Check me out)
Yeah, yeah (ALC)
(Don P, Mac)
Uh
Yeah

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
All I got for these niggas is expletives and slugs
All I got for these bitches is big dick and drugs
Alcohol and guns, don't be scared now you got it, thug
Smart enough to chill the fuck out until it's time to dump
Release so much rage in such a short space
I'll put your face in your cornflakes, mob-style
You gave them Goma power, your honey want it, nigga, hold it down
Hood nigga, she love my style, I knocked the cat out, nigga
I'll pull a Lufthansa, nigga, is that your bitch?
I took that back to the casa, I'm always pulling the heist, I can't help that
Bitches wanna, to know what that ride be like for just one night
I blow up mine and get low, there's too much dough out here to be broke
So I hit the curb and bend a few corners bumping this shit here
Turnt all the way up, niggas getting robbed tonight, let's be clear
Come up off of them things, a nigga gone die tonight, I leave you here
You give me your valuables, no funny moves, I swear

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Uh, uh
A man walked in with a smile on his face and a loaded .45 in his hand (In his hand)
Told the clerk "Don’t move, I didn't come here to shoot, but I will, so you must understand" Bang!
Shots in the air, no time to waste, been doin' drugs all day, now his mind erased (Gone)
Fuck the register, he better find the safe, get the money, hit his homies up, and congregate (Uh-huh)
I need bread, my kid need to be fed, this is the recession, going through depression (Whoa)
I ain't done sinning 'cause I ain't done winning (No,) gotta be fucked up to make it to the top, where the money at?
I could be next to me, Death in Venice, work at CVS, and one day you’ll manage (You'll manage)
Rejects, emotionally damaged, you kids need a shrink, let me call Rick Moranis (Okay)
Want to get a crib in Atlantis ('lantis,) knock a bitch out cold, she Rick Rambis (Whoa)
Tell Dorothy we ain't in Kansas (No,) livin' in this world, but we don't understand it (Whoa,) no
Bullshit, you can't sell that (Nope,) all these kids who get held back (Yep)
My cup filled and my L fat, thinkin', 'we just want Dave Chappelle back'
Run and tell that, I’m coming through the function with a 

[?] too disgusting for discussion (Whoa)
Yep, that's Alchemist on production, little bit Larry Fishy, it's nothing (Haha)
God vs man (Man,) lion vs lamb (Lamb,) competition ain't shit (Ain't shit)
I'ma treat you all like my bitch (My bitch,) you can start by sucking this dick!
Biotch
*Gunshot*

[Verse 1]
Gypsy gal, the hands of Harlem
Cannot hold you to its heat
Your temperature is too hot for taming
Your flaming feet are burning up the street
I'm homeless, come and take me
To the reach of your rattlin' drums
Let me know, babe, all about my fortune
Down along my restless palms

[Verse 2]
Gypsy gal, you got me swallowed
I have fallen far beneath
Your pearly eyes, so fast and slashing
And your flashing diamond teeth
The night is pitch black, come an’ make my
Pale face fit into place, ah, please!
Let me know, babe, I’m nearly drowning
If it’s you my lifelines trace

[Verse 3]
I been wondering all about me
Ever since I seen you there
On the cliffs of your wildcat charms I’m riding
I know I’m around you but I don’t know where
You have slayed me, you have made me
I got to laugh half ways off my heels
I got to know, babe, yeah will you surround me?
So I can know if I’m really real

[Intro]
I've been around this whole country
But I never yet found Fenneario

[Verse 1]
Well, as we marched down, as we marched down
Well, as we marched down to Fennerio
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove
Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O

[Verse 2]
Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O
What will your mother say to know you're going away
You're never, never, never coming back-io ?

[Verse 3]
Come a-running down your stairs
Come a-running down your stairs
Come a-running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O
Come a-running down your stairs
Combing back your yellow hair
You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-io

[Verse 4]
The lieutenant he has gone
The lieutenant he has gone
The lieutenant he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O
The lieutenant he has gone, long gone
He's a-riding down in Texas with the rodeo

[Verse 5]
Well, our captain he is dead, our captain he is dead
Our captain he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O
Well, our captain he is dead, died for a maid
He's buried somewhere in Louisiana-O

[Intro]
This is dedicated
To a Mr. Bream
A Mr. Read
A Mr. Pinty
And a Mr. Mood

[Verse 1]
I've hit rock bottom
Ooh, now I'm running away
I've made it, babe
Think what your lover would say
Think in a brotherly way
See, girl, I won't say it
Until it finds me
One day

[Verse 2]
My mind starts to derange
Distortions arrange as sight loses its range
As everyone's perspective begins to change
Ooh, I'm the same
Just something to blame
Another thing wrong with the game
And watch me as I descend
Into shame
Into
Into shame
Into
Into shame

[Bridge]
And when your heart's got no more, you're lying dead on the floor
The wounds in your back are still sore
And everyone who watched you watched on in awe
But now you see who's nothing but poor
Another lost soul who never accomplished a goal or made a light out of their lives
And they're the ones who pulled out the knife
And like that, oh, everything is gone in front of your eyes
Your hands have lost their grip on their prize
And you've got no more tries
'Cause you lost them through lies
Oh, but your lucky this time
And hopefully it'll make you seem more wise
Or otherwise
They'll leave you to your own demise

[Outro]
'Cause it's the end of something I did not want to end, beginning of hard times to come
Oh, but something that was not meant to be is done and this is the start of what was

[Chorus]
Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door
Highway 51 runs right by my baby's door
If I don't get the girl I'm loving
Won't go down to Highway 51 no more

[Verse]
Well, I know that highway like I know my hand
Yes, I know that highway like I know the back of my hand
Running from up Wisconsin way down to no man's land

Well, if I should die before my time should come
And if I should die before my time should come
Won't you bury my body out on the Highway 51

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Mary wore three links of chain
Every link was Jesus name
Keep your hand on that plow, hold on
Oh Lord, Oh Lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on

[Verse 2]
Mary, Mark, Luke and John
All these prophets so good and gone
Keep your hand on that plow, hold on
Oh Lord, Oh Lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on
Well, I never been to heaven
But I've been told streets up there
Are lined with gold
Keep your hand on that plow, hold on
Oh Lord, Oh Lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on
Oh Lord, Oh Lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on
Oh Lord, Oh Lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on

[Chorus]
There is a house down in New Orleans they call the rising sun
And it's been the ruin of many poor girl and me, oh God, I'm one

[Verse 1]
My mother was a tailor, she sewed these new blue jeans
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord, down in New Orleans

[Verse 2]
Now the only thing a gambler needs is a suitcase and a trunk
And the only time when he's satisfied is when he's on a drunk

[Verse 3]
He fills his glasses up to the brim and he'll pass the cards around
And the only pleasure he gets out of life is rambling from town to town

[Verse 4]
Oh tell my baby sister not to do what I have done
But shun that house in New Orleans they call the rising sun

[Verse 5]
Well with one foot on the platform and the other foot on the train
I'm going back to New Orleans to wear that ball and chain

[Verse 6]
I'm going back to New Orleans, my race is almost run
I'm going back to end my life down in the rising sun

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I was born in Dixie in a boomer shed
Just a little shanty by the railroad track
Freight train was it taught me how to cry
The holler of the driver was my lullaby
I got the freight train blues
Oh Lord mama, I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes
And when the whistle blows I got to go baby, don't you know
Well, it looks like I'm never going to lose the freight train blues

[Verse 2]
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama-ha
She was the only daughter of an engineer
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke
Seems a waste to get a good man broke
I got the freight train blues
Oh Lord mama, I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes
And when the whistle blows I got to go mama, don't you know
Well, it looks like I'm never going to lose the freight train blues

[Verse 3]
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train
Every place I want to go I never can go
Because you know I got the freight train blues
Oh Lord mama, I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes

[Verse 1]
Rambling out of the wild West
Leaving the towns I love the best
Thought I’d seen some ups and downs
'Til I come into New York town
People going down to the ground
Buildings going up to the sky

[Verse 2]
Wintertime in New York town
The wind blowing snow around
Walk around with nowhere to go
Somebody could freeze right to the bone
I froze right to the bone
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years
I didn’t feel so cold then

[Verse 3]
I swung on to my old guitar
Grabbed hold of a subway car
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
I landed up on the downtown side
Greenwich Village

[Verse 4]
I walked down there and ended up
In one of them coffeehouses on the block
Got on the stage to sing and play
Man there said, “Come back some other day
You sound like a hillbilly
We want folk singers here”

[Verse 5]
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day
I blowed inside out and upside down
The man there said he loved my sound
He was raving about how he loved my sound
Dollar a day’s worth

[Verse 6]
And after weeks and weeks of hanging around
I finally got a job in New York town
In a bigger place, bigger money too
Even joined the union and paid my dues

[Verse 7]
Now, a very great man once said
That some people rob you with a fountain pen
It didn’t take too long to find out
Just what he was talkin’ about
A lot of people don’t have much food on their table
But they got a lot of forks ’n’ knives
And they got to cut something

[Verse 8]
So one morning when the sun was warm
I rambled out of New York town
Pulled my cap down over my eyes
And headed out for the western skies
So long, New York
Howdy, East Orange

[Verse 1]
Well, in my time of dying don't want nobody to mourn
All I want for you to do is take my body home
Well, well, well, so I can die easy
Well, well, well
Well, well, well, so I can die easy
Jesus going to make up, Jesus going to make up
Jesus going to make up my dying bed

[Verse 2]
Well, meet me Jesus, meet me, meet me
In the middle of the air
If these wings should fail me
Lord, won't you meet me with another pair
Well, well, well, so I can die easy
Well, well, well
Well, well, well, so I can die easy
Jesus going to make up, Jesus going to make up
Jesus going to make up my dying bed

[Verse 3]
Lord, in my time of dying don't want nobody to cry
All I want you to do is take me when I die
Well, well, well, so I can die easy
Well, well, well
Well, well, well, so I can die easy
Jesus going to make up, Jesus going to make up
Jesus going to make up my dying bed

[Verse 1]
I am a man of constant sorrow
I've seen trouble all my days
I'll say goodbye to Colorado
Where I was born and partly raised

[Verse 2]
Your mother says that I'm a stranger
My face you'll never see no more
But there's one promise darling
I'll see you on God's golden shore

[Verse 3]
Through this open world I'm a-bound to ramble
Through ice and snow, sleet and rain
I'm a-bound to ride that morning railroad
Perhaps I'll die on that train

[Verse 4]
I'm a-going back to Colorado
The place that I've started from
If I'd know-ed how bad you'd treat me
Honey, I never would have come
Takes rocks and gravel, baby, make a solid road
Make a solid road
Takes rocks and gravel, baby, make a solid road
Make a solid road

Takes a good woman mama
To satisfy my weary soul

Have you ever been down on that Mobil and K. C. line
Have you ever been down on that Mobil and K. C. line?

Well I just want to ask you
If you seen that gal of mine
Don't the clouds look lonesome shining across the sea
Don't the clouds look lonesome shining across the sea
Don't my gal look good
When she's comin' after me?

[Verse 1]
I will not go down under the ground
’Cause somebody tells me that death’s coming 'round
An’ I will not carry myself down to die
When I go to my grave my head will be high

[Refrain]
Let me die in my footsteps
Before I go down under the ground

[Verse 2]
There’s been rumors of war and wars that have been
The meaning of life has been lost in the wind
And some people thinking that the end is close by
’Stead of learning to live they are learning to die

[Refrain]
Let me die in my footsteps
Before I go down under the ground

[Verse 3]
I don’t know if I’m smart but I think I can see
When someone is pulling the wool over me
And if this war comes and death’s all around
Let me die on this land ’fore I die underground

[Refrain]
Let me die in my footsteps
Before I go down under the ground

[Verse 4]
There’s always been people that have to cause fear
They’ve been talking about war now for many long years
I have read all their statements and I’ve not said a word
But now Lawd God, let my poor voice be heard

[Refrain]
Let me die in my footsteps
Before I go down under the ground

[Verse 5]
Let me drink from the waters where the mountain streams flood
Let the smell of wildflowers flow free through my blood
Let me sleep in your meadows with the green grassy leaves
Let me walk down the highway with my brother in peace

[Refrain]
Let me die in my footsteps
Before I go down under the ground

[Verse 6]
Go out in your country where the land meets the sun
See the craters and the canyons where the waterfalls run
Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Idaho
Let every state in this union seep down deep in your souls
And you’ll die in your footsteps
Before you go down under the ground

[Verse 1]
Come around you roving’ gamblers and a story I will tell
About the greatest gambler, you all should know him well
His name was Will O’Conley and he gambled all his life
He had twenty-seven children, yet he never had a wife
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows

[Verse 2]
He gambled in the White House and in the railroad yards
Wherever there was people, there was Willie and his cards
He had the reputation as the gamblingest man around
Wives would keep their husbands home when Willie came to town
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows

[Verse 3]
Sailing’ down the Mississippi to a town called New Orleans
They’re still talking’ about their card game on that Jackson River Queen
“I’ve come to win some money,” Gambling Willie says
When the game finally ended up, the whole damn boat was his
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows

[Verse 4]
Up in the Rocky Mountains in a town called Cripple Creek
There was an all-night poker game, lasted about a week
Nine hundred miners had laid their money down
When Willie finally left the room, he owned the whole damn town
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows

[Verse 5]
But Willie had a heart of gold and this I know is true
He supported all his children and all their mothers too
He wore no rings or fancy things, like other gamblers wore
He spread his money far and wide, to help the sick and the poor
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows

[Verse 6]
When you played your cards with Willie, you never really knew
Whether he was bluffing or whether he was true
He won a fortune from a man who folded in his chair
The man, he left a diamond flush, Willie didn’t even have a pair
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows

[Verse 7]
It was late one evening’ during a poker game
A man lost all his money, he said Willie was to blame
He shot poor Willie through the head, which was a tragic fate
When Willie’s cards fell on the floor, they were aces backed with eights
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows

[Verse 8]
So all you roving’ gamblers, wherever you might be
The moral of the story is very plain to see
Make your money while you can, before you have to stop
For when you pull that dead man’s hand, your gambling days are up
And it’s ride, Willie, ride
Roll, Willie, roll
Wherever you are a-gambling now, nobody really knows

[Verse 1]
Well, I was feeling sad and feeling blue
I didn’t know what in the world I wus gonna do
Them Communists they was coming around
They was in the air
They was on the ground
They wouldn’t give me no peace

[Verse 2]
So I run down most hurriedly
And joined up with the John Birch Society
I got me a secret membership card
And started off a-walking down the road
Yee-hoo, I’m a real John Bircher now!
Look out you Commies!

[Verse 3]
Now we all agree with Hitler’s views
Although he killed six million Jews
It don’t matter too much that he was a Fascist
At least you can’t say he was a Communist!
That’s to say like if you got a cold you take a shot of malaria

[Verse 4]
Well, I woos looking everywhere for them gol-darned Reds
I got up in the morning and looked under my bed
Looked in the sink, behind the door
Looked in the glove compartment of my car
Couldn’t find them

[Verse 5]
I woos looking high and low for them Reds everywhere
I woos looking in the sink and underneath the chair
I looked way up my chimney hole
I even looked deep down inside my toilet bowl
They got away

[Verse 6]
Well, I woos sitting home alone and started to sweat
Figured they woos in my T.V. set
Peeked behind the picture frame
Got a shock from my feet, hitting right up in the brain
Them Reds caused it!
I know they did them hard-core ones

[Verse 7]
Well, I quit my job so I could work all alone
Then I changed my name to Sherlock Holmes
Followed some clues from my detective bag
And discovered they woos red stripes on the American flag!
That old Betsy Ross

[Verse 8]
Well, I investigated all the books in the library
Ninety percent of them gotta be burned away
I investigated all the people that I know
Ninety-eight percent of them gotta go
The other two percent are fellow Birchers just like me

[Verse 9]
Now Eisenhower, he’s a Russian spy
Lincoln, Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy
To my knowledge there’s just one man
That’s really a true American: George Lincoln Rockwell
I know for a fact he hates Commies because he picketed the movie Exodus

[Verse 10]
Well, I finally started thinking straight
When I run out of things to investigate
Couldn’t imagine doing anything else
So now I’m sitting home investigating myself!
Hope I don’t find out anything hmm, great God!

[Verse 1]
Hollis Brown
He lived on the outside of town
Hollis Brown
He lived on the outside of town
With his wife and five children
And his cabin broken down

[Verse 2]
He looked for work and money
And he walked a ragged mile
He looked for work and money
And ya' walked a ragged mile
Your children are so hungry
That they don’t know how to smile

[Verse 3]
Your baby’s eyes look crazy
They’re a-tugging at your sleeve
Your baby’s eyes look crazy
They’re a-tugging at your sleeve
You walk the floor and wonder why
With every breath you breathe

[Verse 4]
The rats have got your flour
Bad blood it got your mare
The rats have got your flour
Bad blood it got your mare
If there’s anyone that knows
Is there anyone that cares?

[Verse 5]
He prayed to the Lord above
Oh please send you a friend
He prayed to the Lord above
Oh please send you a friend
Your empty pockets tell ya'
That you ain’t a-got no friend

[Verse 6]
Your babies are crying louder now
It’s a-poundin' on your brain
Your babies are crying louder now
It’s a-poundin' on your brain
Your wife’s screams are stabbin' ya
Like the dirty drivin' rain

[Verse 7]
Your grass is turnin' black
There’s no water in your well
Your grass is turnin' black
There’s no water in your well
You spent your last lone dollar
On seven shotgun shells

[Verse 8]
Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
That’s hanging on the wall

[Verse 9]
Your brain is a-bleedin'
And your legs can’t seem to stand
Your brain is a-bleedin'
And your legs can’t seem to stand
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
That you’re holding in your hand

[Verse 10]
There’s seven breezes blowin'
All around the cabin door
There’s seven breezes blowin'
All around the cabin door
Seven shots ring out
Like the ocean’s poundin' roar

[Verse 11]
There’s seven people dead
On a South Dakota farm
There’s seven people dead
On a South Dakota farm
Somewheres in the distance
There’s seven new people born
Oh my name it ain't nothin'
My age it means less
The country I come from
Is called the Midwest
I’s taught and brought up there
The laws to abide
And that the land that I live in
Has God on its side

Oh the history books tell it
They tell it so well
The cavalries charged
The Indians fell
The cavalries charged
The Indians died
Ah the country was young
With God on its side

The Spanish-American
War had its day
And the Civil War too
Was soon laid away
And the names of the heroes
I’s made to memorize
With guns in their hands
And God on their side
The First World War boys
It came and it went
The reason for fightin'
I never did get
But I learned to accept it
Accept it with pride
For you don’t count the dead
When God’s on your side

The Second World War
Came to an end
We forgave the Germans
And then we were friends
Though they murdered six million
In the ovens they fried
The Germans now too
Have God on their side

I’ve learned to hate the Russians
All through my whole life
If another war comes
It’s them we must fight
To hate them and fear them
To run and to hide
And accept it all bravely
With God on my side
But now we got weapons
Of chemical dust
If fire them we’re forced to
Then fire them we must
One push of the button
And a shot the world wide
And ya' never ask questions
When God’s on your side

Through many dark hour
I been thinking about this
That Jesus Christ
Was betrayed by a kiss
But I can’t think for ya'
You’ll have to decide
Whether Judas Iscariot
Had God on his side

So now as I’m leavin'
I’m weary as Hell
The confusion I’m feelin'
Ain't no tongue can tell
The words fill my head
And they fall to the floor
If God’s on our side
He’ll stop the next war
Down the street the dogs are barkin'
And the day is a-gettin' dark
As the night comes in a-falling
The dogs will lose their bark
And the silent night will shatter
From the sounds inside my mind
Yes I’m one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind

From the crossroads of my doorstep
My eyes start to fade
And I turn my head back to the room
Where my love and I have laid
And I gaze back to the street
The sidewalk and the sign
And I’m one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind

It’s a restless hungry feeling
That don’t mean no one no good
When everything I’m a-sayin'
You can say it just as good
You’re right from your side
I'm right from mine
We’re both just one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind

[Verse 1]
I got a bad disease
Up from my brain is where I bleed
Insanity it seems
Has got me by my soul to squeeze
Well all the love from me
With all the dying trees I scream
The angels in my dreams, yeah
Have turned to demons of greed, that's mean

[Chorus]
Where I go, I just don't know
I got to, got to, gotta take it slow
When I find my peace of mind
I'm gonna give you some of my good time

[Verse 2]
Today love smiled on me
It took away my pain, said please
I’ll let your ride be free
You gotta let it be, oh yeah

[Chorus]
Where I go, I just don't know
I got to, gotta, gotta take it slow
When I find my peace of mind
I'm gonna give you some of my good time

[Guitar Solo]

[Interlude]
Yeah!

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Oh so polite indeed
Well I got everything I need
Oh make my days a breeze
And take away my self destruction
It's bitter baby and it's very sweet
A holy rollercoaster but I'm on my feet
Take me to the river, let me on your shore
Well, I'll be coming back baby, I'll be coming back for more

[Bridge]
Doo doo doo doo dingle zing a dong bone
Ba-di ba-da ba-zumba crunga cong gone bad
I could not forget but I will not endeavour
Simple pleasures are much better, but I won’t regret it, never

[Chorus]
Where I go, I just don't know
I got to, got to, gotta take it slow
When I find my peace of mind
I'm gonna give you some of my good time

[Outro]
Where I go I just don't know
I might end up somewhere in Mexico
When I find my peace of mind
I'm gonna keep it for the end of time

[Verse 1]
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers’ blood
A finger fired the trigger to his name
A handle hid out in the dark
A hand set the spark
Two eyes took the aim
Behind a man’s brain
But he can’t be blamed
He’s only a pawn in their game

[Verse 2]
A South politician preaches to the poor white man
“You got more than the blacks, don’t complain
You’re better than them, you been born with white skin,” they explain
And the Negro’s name
Is used it is plain
For the politician’s gain
As he rises to fame
And the poor white remains
On the caboose of the train
But it ain't him to blame
He’s only a pawn in their game

[Verse 3]
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid
And the marshals and cops get the same
But the poor white man’s used in the hands of them all like a tool
He’s taught in his school
From the start by the rule
That the laws are with him
To protect his white skin
To keep up his hate
So he never thinks straight
'Bout the shape that he’s in
But it ain't him to blame
He’s only a pawn in their game

[Verse 4]
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
And the hoof beats pound in his brain
And he’s taught how to walk in a pack
Shoot in the back, with his fist in a clinch
To hang and to lynch
To hide 'neath the hood
To kill with no pain
Like a dog on a chain
He ain't a-got no name
But it ain't him to blame
He’s only a pawn in their game

[Verse 5]
Today, Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught
They lowered him down as a king
But when the shadowy sun sets on the one
That fired the gun
He’ll see by his grave
On the stone that remains
Carved next to his name
His epitaph plain
Only a pawn in their game

[Verse 1]
Oh, I’m sailin' away my own true love
I’m a-sailin' away in the morning
Is there somethin' I can send you from across the sea
From the place that I’ll be landing?

[Verse 2]
No, there’s nothin' you can send me, my own true love
There’s nothin' I'm a-wishing to be ownin'
Just a-carry yourself back to me unspoiled
From across that lonesome ocean

[Verse 3]
Ah, but I just thought you might want somethin' fine
Made of silver or of golden
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Or from the coast of Barcelona

[Verse 4]
Well, if I had the stars from the darkest night
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean
I’d forsake them all for your sweet kiss
For that’s all I’m a-wishin' to be ownin'

[Verse 5]
Well I might be gone a long old time
And it’s only that I’m asking
Is there somethin' I can send you to remember me by
To make your time more easy passing

[Verse 6]
Oh, how can, how can you ask me again
It only brings me sorrow
The same thing I would want today
I want again tomorrow

[Verse 7]
I got a letter on a lonesome day
It was from her ship a-sailin'
Sayin' I don’t know when I’ll be comin' back again
It depends on how I’m a-feelin'

[Verse 8]
If a-you, my love, must think that-a-way
I’m sure your mind is a-roamin'
I’m sure your thoughts are not with me
But with the country to where you’re goin'

[Verse 9]
So take heed, take heed of the western winds
Take heed of the stormy weather
And yes, there’s somethin' you can send back to me
Spanish boots of Spanish leather

[Verse 1]
Oh, the time will come up
When the winds will stop
And the breeze will cease to be breathin'
Like the stillness in the wind
Before the hurricane begins
The hour that the ship comes in

[Chorus]
And the sea will split
And the ships will hit
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
Then the tide will sound
And the waves will pound
And the mornin' will be a-breakin'

[Verse 2]
The fishes will laugh
As they swim out of the path
And the seagulls, they'll be smilin'
And the rocks on the sand
Will proudly stand
The hour that the ship comes in

[Chorus]
And the words that are used
For to get the ship confused
Will not be understood as they're spoken
For the chains of the sea
Will have busted in the night
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean

[Verse 3]
A song will lift
As the mainsail shifts
And the boat drifts on to the shoreline
And the sun will respect
Every face on the deck
The hour that the ship comes in

[Chorus]
Then the sands will roll
Out a carpet of gold
For your weary toes to be a-touchin'
And the ship's wise men
Will remind you once again
That the whole wide world is watchin'

[Verse 4]
Oh, the foes will rise
With the sleep still in their eyes
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreamin'
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal
And they'll know that it's for real
The hour that the ship comes in

[Chorus]
And they'll raise their hands
Sayin', "We'll meet all your demands"
But we'll shout from the bow, "Your days are numbered"
And like Pharoah's tribe
They'll be drowned in the tide
And like Goliath, they'll be conquered

[Verse 1]
William Zanzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
With a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger
At a Baltimore hotel society gatherin'
And the cops was called in and his weapon took from him
As they rode him in custody down to the station
And booked William Zanzinger for first-degree murder
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face
Now ain't the time for your tears

[Verse 2]
William Zanzinger, who at twenty-four years
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres
With rich wealthy parents who provide and protect him
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
And swear words and sneering, and his tongue it was a-snarling
And in a matter of minutes on bail was out walking
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize fears
Take the rag away from your face
Now ain't the time for your tears

[Verse 3]
Hattie Carroll was a maid in the kitchen
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
And never sat once at the head of the table
And didn’t even talk to the people at the table
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
That sailed through the air and came down through the room
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle
And she never done nothin' to William Zanzinger
And you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face
Now ain't the time for your tears

[Verse 4]
In the courtroom of honor, the judge pounded his gavel
To show that all’s equal and that the courts are on the level
And that the strings in the books ain’t pulled and persuaded
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Once that the cops have chased after and caught ’em
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom
Stared at the person who killed for no reason
Who just happened to be feelin' that way without warnin'
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished
And handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance
William Zanzinger with a six-month sentence
Ah, but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
Bury the rag deep in your face
For now’s the time for your tears
Oh all the money that in my whole life I did spend
Be it mine right or wrongfully
I let it slip gladly to my friends
To tie up the time most forcefully
But the bottles are done
We’ve killed each one
And the table’s full and overflowed
And the corner sign
Says it’s closin' time
So I’ll bid farewell and be down the road

Oh every girl that ever I’ve touched
I did not do it harmfully
And every girl that ever I’ve hurt
I did not do it knowingly
But to remain as friends
You need the time to make amends
And stay behind
And since my feet are now fast
And point away from the past
I’ll bid farewell and be down the line
Oh every foe that ever I faced
The cause was there before we came
And every cause that ever I fought
I fought it full without regret or shame
But the dark does die
As the curtain is drawn and somebody’s eyes
Must meet the dawn
And if I see the day
I’d only have to stay
So I’ll bid farewell in the night and be gone

Oh, every thought that’s strung a knot in my mind
I might go insane if it couldn’t be sprung
But it’s not to stand naked under unknowin' eyes
It’s for myself and my friends my stories are sung
But the time ain’t tall, if on time you depend
And no word is possessed by no special friend
And though the line is cut
It ain’t quite the end
I’ll just bid farewell 'til we meet again

Oh a false clock tries to tick out my time
To disgrace, distract, and bother me
And the dirt of gossip blows into my face
And the dust of rumors covers me
But if the arrow is straight
And the point is slick
It can pierce through dust no matter how thick
So I’ll make my stand
And remain as I am
And bid farewell and not give a damn

[Verse 1]
I ain't lookin' to compete with you
Beat or cheat or mistreat you
Simplify you, classify you
Deny, defy or crucify you
All I really want to do
Is, baby, be friends with you

[Verse 2]
No, and I ain't lookin' to fight with you
Frighten you or uptighten you
Drag you down or drain you down
Chain you down or bring you down
All I really want to do
Is, baby, be friends with you

[Verse 3]
I ain't lookin' to block you up
Shock or knock or lock you up
Analyze you, categorize you
Finalize you or advertise you
All I really want to do
Is, baby, be friends with you

[Verse 4]
I don’t wanta' straight-face you
Race or chase you, track or trace you
Or disgrace you or displace you
Or define you or confine you
All I really want to do
Is, baby, be friends with you

[Verse 5]
I don’t wanta' meet your kin
Make you spin or do you in
Or select you or dissect you
Or inspect you or reject you
All I really want to do
Is, baby, be friends with you

[Verse 6]
I don’t wanta' fake you out
Take or shake or forsake you out
I ain't lookin' for you to feel like me
See like me or be like me
All I really want to do
Is, baby, be friends with you

[Verse 1]
I woke in the mornin', wandering
Weary and worn out
I woke in the morning’, wandering
Weary and worn out
Wishin’ my long-lost lover
Would walk to me, and talk to me, tell me what it’s all about

[Verse 2]
I was standin’ at the side road
Listenin’ to the billboard knock
Standin' at the side road
Listenin’ to the billboard knock
Well, my wrist was empty
But my nerves were kickin’, tickin’ like a clock

[Verse 3]
Well I got anything you need, babe
Let me tell you in front
If I got anything you need, babe
Let me tell you in front
You can come to me sometime
Night time, day time, any time you want

[Verse 4]
Sometimes I’m thinkin' I’m
Too high to fall
Sometimes I’m thinkin' I’m
Much too high to fall
Other times I’m thinkin' I’m
So low I don’t know if I can come up at all

[Verse 5]
Black crows in the meadow
Sleepin' across a broad highway
Black crows in the meadow
Across a broad highway
Though it’s funny, honey
I'm outta' touch, don’t feel much like a scarecrow today

[Verse 1]
Far between sundown’s finish and midnight’s broken toll
We ducked inside the doorways, thunder went crashing
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds
Seemin' to be the chimes of freedom flashing
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

[Verse 2]
Through the city’s melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
With faces hidden as the walls were tightening
As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin’ rain
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake
Tolling for the luckless, they abandoned and forsaked
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

[Verse 3]
Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze
Leavin' only bells of lightning and it's thunder
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind
And the poet and the painter far behind his rightful time
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

[Verse 4]
And the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
For disrobed faceless forms of no position
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts
All down in taken-for-granted situations
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute
For the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

[Verse 5]
Even though a cloud’s white curtain in a far-off corner flared
And the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
Condemned to drift or else be kept from driftin'
Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

[Verse 6]
Starry-eyed and laughing as I recall when we were caught
Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look
Spellbound and swallowed ’til the tolling ended
Tolling for the aching whose wounds cannot be nursed
For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'

[Verse 1]
I’m just average, common too
I’m just like him, and the same as you
I’m everybody’s brother and son
I ain't different than anyone
Ain't no use a-talk to me
It’s just the same as talkin' to you

[Verse 2]
I was shadow boxing early in the day
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay
I said “Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come
26, 27, 28, 29, I’m gonna' make your face look just like mine
Five, four, three, two, one, Cassius Clay you’d better run
99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won’t even recognize you
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen”

[Verse 3]
Well, I don’t know, but I’ve been told
The streets of heaven are lined with gold
I ask ya' how things could get much worse
If the Russians happen to get up there first
Wowee! Pretty scary!

[Verse 4]
Now, I’m liberal, but to a degree
I want everybody to be free
But if you think I’ll let Barry Goldwater
Move in next door and marry my daughter
You must think I’m crazy!
I wouldn’t let him do it for all the farms in Cuba

[Verse 5]
Well, I set my monkey on the log
And ordered him to do the Dog
He wagged his tail and shook his head
And he went and did the Cat instead
He’s a weird monkey, very funky

[Verse 6]
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on
Waitin' to play tennis in the noonday sun
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
And my wig-hat was fallin' in my face
But they wouldn’t let me on the tennis court

[Verse 7]
I got a woman, she’s so mean
She sticks my boots in the washing machine
Sticks me with buckshot when I’m nude
Puts bubblegum in my food
She’s funny, wants my money, calls me “honey”

[Verse 8]
Now I got a friend who spends his life
Stabbin' my picture with a Bowie knife
Dreams of stranglin' me with a scarf
When my name comes up he pretends to barf
I got a million friends!

[Verse 9]
Now they asked me to read a poem
At the sorority sisters home
Ah got knocked down and my head was swimmin'
I wound up with the Dean of Women
Yippee! I’m a poet, and I know it
Hope I don’t blow it

[Verse 10]
I’m gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange
So I look like a walking mountain range
And I’m gonna' ride into Omaha on a horse
Out to the country club and the golf course
Carryin' The New York Times, shoot a few holes, blow their minds

[Verse 11]
Now you’re probably wonderin' by now
Just what this song is all about
What’s probably got you baffled more
Is what this thing here is for:
(plays song's riff)

It’s nothin'
It’s sumpin' I learned over in England!

[Verse 1]
Ramona
Come closer
Shut softly your watery eyes
The pangs of your sadness
Will pass as your senses will rise
Oh the flowers of the city
Though breath-like
Get death-like at times
And there’s no use in trying
To deal with the dying
Though I cannot explain that in lines

[Verse 2]
Your cracked country lips
I still wish to kiss
As to be by the strength of your skin
Your magnetic movements
Still capture the minutes I’m in
But it grieves my heart, love
To see you trying to be a part of
A world that just don’t exist
It’s all just a dream, babe
A vacuum, a scheme, babe
That sucks you into feelin' like this

[Verse 3]
I can see that your head
Has been twisted and fed
With the worthless foam from the mouth
I can tell you are torn
Between staying and returning
Back to the South
You’ve been fooled into thinking
That the finishing end is at hand
Yet there’s no one to beat you
No one to defeat you
'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad

[Verse 4]
I’ve heard you say many times
That you’re better than no one
And no one is better than you
If you really believe that
You know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose
From fixtures and forces and friends
Your sorrow does stem
That hype you and type you
Making you feel
That you gotta' be just like them

[Verse 5]
I’d forever talk to you
But soon my words
Would turn into a meaningless ring
For deep in my heart
I know there's no help I can bring
Everything passes
Everything changes
Just do what you think you should do
And someday maybe
Who knows, baby
I’ll come and be crying to you

[Verse 1]
I pounded on a farmhouse looking for a place to stay
I was mighty, mighty tired, I'd come a long, long way
I said, “Hey, hey, in there, is there anybody home?”
I was standin' on the steps feeling most alone
When out comes a farmer, he must've thought that I was nuts
He immediately looked at me and stuck a gun into my guts

[Verse 2]
I fell down to my bended knees
Saying, “I dig farmers, don’t shoot me, please!”
He cocked his rifle and begin to shout
“Are you that travelin' salesman that I have heard about?”
I said, “No! No! No! I’m a doctor and it’s true
I’m a clean-cut kid and I been to college, too”

[Verse 3]
Then in comes his daughter whose name was Rita
She looked like she stepped out of La Dolce Vita
I immediately tried to cool it with her dad
And told him what a nice, pretty farm he had
He said, “What do doctors know about farms, pray tell?”
I said, “I's born at the bottom of a wishing well”

[Verse 4]
Well, by the dirt 'neath my nails, I guess he knew I wouldn’t lie
He said “I guess you’re tired," he said it kind of sly
I said, “Yes, ten thousand miles today I drove”
He said, “I got a bed for you underneath the stove
Just one condition, you can go to sleep right now
That you don’t touch my daughter and in the morning, milk the cows”

[Verse 5]
I was sleeping like a rat when I heard something jerkin’
There stood Rita looking just like Tony Perkins
She said, “Would you like to take a shower? I’ll show you up to the door”
I said, “Oh, no, no, I’ve been through this movie before”
I knew I had to split but I did not know how
When she said “would you like to take that shower now?”

[Verse 6]
Well, I couldn’t leave unless the old man chased me out
Because I’d already promised that I’d milk his cows
I had to say somethin' to strike him very weird
So I yelled out “I like Fidel Castro and his beard”
Rita looked offended but she got out of the way
As he came charging down the stairs sayin', “What’s that I heard you say?”

[Verse 7]
I said, “I like Fidel Castro, I think you heard me right”
And I ducked as he swung at me with all his might
Rita mumbled somethin' 'bout her mother on the hill
As his fist it hit the icebox, he said he’s gonna kill me
If I don’t get out the door in two seconds flat
“You unpatriotic, rotten doctor Commie rat”

[Verse 8]
Well, he threw a Reader’s Digest at my head and I did run
I did a somersault as I seen him get his gun
And crashed through the window at a hundred miles an hour
And landed fully blast in his garden flowers
Rita said, “Come back!” as he started to load
The sun was coming up and I was running down the road

[Verse 9]
Well, I don’t figure I’ll be back there for a spell
Even though Rita moved away and got a job in a motel
He still waits for me, constant, on the sly
He wants to turn me in to the F.B.I
Me, I romp and stomping, thankful as I romp
Without freedom of speech, I might be in the swamp

[Verse 1]
Crimson flames tied through my ears
Rolling high and mighty traps
Pounced with fire on flaming roads
Using ideas as my maps
“We’ll meet on edges, soon,” said I
Proud 'neath heated brow

[Refrain]
Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now

[Verse 2]
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth
“Rip down all hate,” I screamed
Lies that life is black and white
Spoke from my skull, I dreamed
Romantic facts of musketeers
Foundationed deep, somehow

[Refrain]
Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now

[Verse 3]
Girls’ faces formed the forward path
From phony jealousy
To memorizing politics
Of ancient history
Flung down by corpse evangelists
Un-thought of, though, somehow

[Refrain]
Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now

[Verse 4]
A self-ordained professor’s tongue
Too serious to fool
Spouted out that liberty
Is just equality in school
“Equality,” I spoke the word
As if a wedding vow

[Refrain]
Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now

[Verse 5]
In a soldier’s stance, I aimed my hand
At the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not that I’d become my enemy
In the instant that I preach
My existence led by confusion boats
Mutiny from stern to bow

[Refrain]
Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now

[Verse 6]
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats
Too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking
I had something to protect
Good and bad, I define these terms
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow

[Refrain]
Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now

[Verse 1]
Go away from my window
Leave at your own chosen speed
I’m not the one you want, babe
I’m not the one you need
You say you're looking for someone
Who's never weak but always strong
To protect you and defend you
Whether you are right or wrong
Someone to open each and every door

[Refrain]
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you’re looking for, babe

[Verse 2]
Go lightly from the ledge, babe
Go lightly on the ground
I’m not the one you want, babe
I will only let you down
You say you're looking for someone
Who will promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes for you
Someone to close his heart
Someone who will die for you and more

[Refrain]
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you’re looking for, babe

[Verse 3]
Go melt back in the night
Everything inside is made of stone
There's nothing in here moving
And anyway I'm not alone
You say you're lookin' for someone
Who'll pick you up each time you fall
To gather flowers constantly
And to come each time you call
A lover for your life and nothing more

[Refrain]
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you’re looking for, babe

[Verse 1]
I am a lonesome hobo
Without family or friends
Where another man’s life might begin
That’s exactly where mine ends
I have tried my hand at bribery
Blackmail and deceit
And I’ve served time for everything
’Cept beggin' on the street

[Verse 2]
Well, once I was rather prosperous
There was nothing I did lack
I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth
And silk upon my back
But I did not trust my brother
I carried him to blame
Which led me to my fatal doom
To wander off in shame

[Verse 3]
Kind ladies and kind gentlemen
Soon I will be gone
But let me just warn you all
Before I do pass on
Stay free from petty jealousies
Live by no man’s code
And hold your judgment for yourself
Lest you wind up on this road

[Intro]
This is a story about a girl named Lucky

[Verse 1]
Early morning, she wakes up
Knock, knock, knock on the door
It's time for makeup, perfect smile
It's you they're all waiting for

[Pre-Chorus]
They go, "Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"
And they say

[Chorus]
"She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?"

[Verse 2]
Lost in an image, in a dream
But there's no one there to wake her up
And the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning
But tell me, what happens when it stops?

[Pre-Chorus]
They go, "Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?"
And they say

[Chorus]
"She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?"

[Interlude]
"Best actress, and the winner is, Lucky!"
"I'm Roger Johnson for Pop News, standing outside the arena waiting for Lucky"
"Oh my God, here she comes!"

[Bridge]
Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?
She is so lucky, but why does she cry?
If there is nothing missing in her life
Why do tears come at night?
And they say

[Chorus]
"She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?"
She's so lucky, she's a star
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?

[Intro]
Ooh, hey, yeah

[Verse 1]
Hush, just stop
There’s nothing you can do or say (Baby)
I've had enough
I'm not your property as from today (Baby)

[Pre-Chorus]
You might think that I won't make it
On my own

[Chorus]
But now I'm stronger than yesterday
Now it’s nothing but my way
My loneliness ain't killing me no more
I, I'm stronger

[Verse 2]
Than I ever thought that I could be (Baby)
I used to go with the flow
Didn't really care 'bout me

[Pre-Chorus]
You might think that I can't take it
But you're wrong

[Chorus]
'Cause now I'm stronger than yesterday
Now it’s nothing but my way
My loneliness ain't killing me no more
I, I'm stronger

[Post-Chorus]
Come on now
Oh, yeah

[Bridge]
Here I go, on my own
I don't need nobody, better off alone
Here I go, on my own now
I don't need nobody, not anybody
Here I go (Here I go, here I go, here I go...)
Alright
(Here I go, here I go, here I go) Here I go

[Chorus]
Stronger than yesterday
It’s nothing but my way
My loneliness ain't killing me no more
I, I'm stronger than yesterday
Now it’s nothing but my way
My loneliness ain't killing me no more
And I'm stronger than yesterday
Now it’s nothing but my way
My loneliness ain't killing me no more (No more)
(I'm) I, I'm stronger

[Verse 1]
John Wesley Harding
Was a friend to the poor
He traveled a'with a gun in ev'ry hand
All along this countryside
He opened a'many a door
But he was never known
To hurt an honest man

[Verse 2]
’Twas down in Chaynee County
A time they talk about
With his lady by his side
He took a stand
And soon the situation there
Was all but straightened out
For he was always known
To lend a helping hand

[Verse 3]
All across the telegraph
His name it did resound
But no charge held against him
Could they prove
And there was no man around
Who could track or chain him down
He was never known
To make a foolish move

[Verse 1]
As I went out one morning
To breathe the air around Tom Paine’s
I spied the fairest damsel
That ever did walk in chains
I offered her my hand
She took me by the arm
I knew that very instant
She meant to do me harm

[Verse 2]
“Depart from me this moment”
I told her with my voice
Said she, “But I don’t wish to”
Said I, “But you have no choice”
“I beg you, sir,” she pleaded
From the corners of her mouth
“I will secretly accept you
And together we’ll fly south”

[Verse 3]
Just then Tom Paine, himself
Came running from across the field
Shouting at this lovely girl
And commanding her to yield
And as she was letting go her grip
Up Tom Paine did run
“I’m sorry, sir,” he said to me
“I’m sorry for what she’s done”

[Verse 1]
I dreamed I saw St. Augustine
Alive as you or me
Tearing through these quarters
In the utmost misery
With a blanket underneath his arm
And a coat of solid gold
Searching for the very souls
Whom already have been sold

[Verse 2]
“Arise, arise,” he cried so loud
With a voice without restraint
“Come out, ye gifted kings and queens
And hear my sad complaint
No martyr is among ye now
Whom you can call your own
But go on your way accordingly
But know you’re not alone”

[Verse 3]
I dreamed I saw St. Augustine
Alive with fiery breath
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones
That put him out to death
Oh, I awoke in anger
So alone and terrified
I put my fingers against the glass
And bowed my head and cried

[Verse 1]
Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest
They were the best of friends
So when Frankie Lee needed money one day
Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
And placed them on a footstool
Just above the plotted plain
Sayin', “Take your pick, Frankie Boy
My loss will be your gain”

[Verse 2]
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down
And put his fingers to his chin
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him
His head began to spin
“Could ya please not stare at me like that?,” he said
“It’s just my foolish pride
But sometimes a man must be alone
And this is no place to hide”

[Verse 3]
Well, Judas, he just winked and said
“Alright, I’ll leave you here
But you’d better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want
Before they all disappear”
“I’m gonna start my pickin' right now
Just tell me where you’ll be”
Judas pointed down the road
And said, “Eternity!”

[Verse 4]
“Eternity?” said Frankie Lee
With a voice as cold as ice
“That’s right,” said Judas, “Eternity
Though you might call it ‘Paradise’”
“I don’t call it anything”
Said Frankie Lee with a smile
“All right,” said Judas Priest
“I’ll see you after a while”

[Verse 5]
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down
Feeling low and mean
When just then a passin' stranger
Burst upon the scene
Saying, “Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler
Whose father's deceased?
Well, if you are, there’s a fellow callin' you down the road
And they say his name is Priest”

[Verse 6]
“Oh, yes, he is my friend”
Said Frankie Lee in fright
“I do recall him very well
In fact, he just left my sight”
“Yes, that’s the one,” said the stranger
As quiet as a mouse
“Well, my message is, he’s down the road
Stranded in a house”

[Verse 7]
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked
He dropped everything and ran
Until he came up to the spot
Where Judas Priest did stand
“What kind of house is this,” he said
“Where I have come to roam?”
“It’s not a house,” says Judas Priest
“It’s not a house, it’s a home”

[Verse 8]
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled
He soon lost all control
Over ev’rything which he had made
While the mission bells did toll
He just stood there staring
At that big house as bright as any sun
With four and twenty windows
And a woman’s face in ev’ry one

[Verse 9]
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee
With a soulful, bounding leap
And, foaming at the mouth
He began to make his midnight creep
For sixteen nights and days he raved
But on the seventeenth he burst
Into the arms of Judas Priest
Which is where he died of thirst

[Verse 10]
No one tried to say a thing
When they carried him out in jest
Except, of course, the little neighbor boy
Who carried him to rest
And he just walked along, alone
With his guilt so well concealed
And muttered underneath his breath
“Nothing is revealed”

[Verse 11]
Well, the moral of this story
The moral of this song
Is simply that one should never be
Where one does not belong
So when you see your neighbor carrying somethin'
Help him with his load
And don’t go mistaking Paradise
For that home across the road

[Verse 1]
“Oh, help me in my weakness”
I heard the drifter say
As they carried him from the courtroom
And were taking him away
“My trip hasn’t been a pleasant one
And my time it isn’t long
And I still do not know
What it was that I’ve done wrong”

[Verse 2]
Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside
A tear came to his eye
“You fail to understand,” he said
“Why must you even try?”
Outside, the crowd was stirring
You could hear it from the door
Inside, the judge was stepping down
While the jury cried for more

[Verse 3]
“Oh, stop that cursed jury”
Cried the attendant and the nurse
“The trial was bad enough
But this is ten times worse”
Just then a bolt of lightning
Struck the courthouse out of shape
And while ev’rybody knelt to pray
The drifter did escape

[Verse 1]
Dear landlord
Please don’t put a price on my soul
My burden is heavy
My dreams are beyond control
When that steamboat whistle blows
I’m gonna give you all I got to give
And I do hope you receive it well
Depending on the way you feel that you live

[Verse 2]
Dear landlord
Please heed these words that I speak
I know you’ve suffered much
But in this you are not so unique
All of us, at times, we might work too hard
To have it too fast and too much
And anyone can fill his life up
With things he can see but he just cannot touch

[Verse 3]
Dear landlord
Please don’t dismiss my case
I’m not about to argue
I’m not about to move to no other place
Now, each of us has his own special gift
And you know this was meant to be true
And if you don’t underestimate me
I won’t underestimate you

[Verse 1]
I pity the poor immigrant
Who wishes he would’ve stayed home
Who uses all his power to do evil
But in the end is always left so alone
That man whom with his fingers cheats
And who lies with every breath
Who passionately hates his life
And likewise, fears his death

[Verse 2]
I pity the poor immigrant
Whose strength is spent in vain
Whose heaven is like Ironsides
Whose tears are like rain
Who eats but is not satisfied
Who hears but does not see
Who falls in love with wealth itself
And turns his back on me

[Verse 3]
I pity the poor immigrant
Who tramples through the mud
Who fills his mouth with laughing
And who builds his town with blood
Whose visions in the final end
Must shatter like the glass
I pity the poor immigrant
When his gladness comes to pass

[Verse 1]
There was a wicked messenger
From Eli he did come
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter
When questioned who had sent for him
He answered with his thumb
For his tongue it could not speak, but only flatter

[Verse 2]
He stayed behind the assembly hall
It was there he made his bed
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
Until one day he just appeared
With a note in his hand which read
“The soles of my feet, I swear they’re burning”

[Verse 3]
Oh, the leaves began to falling
And the seas began to part
And the people that confronted him were many
And he was told but these few words
Which opened up his heart
“If ye cannot bring good news, then don’t bring any”

[Verse 1]
Down along the cove
I spied my true love comin’ my way
Down along the cove
I spied my true love comin’ my way
I say, “Lord, have mercy, mama
It sure is good to see ya' comin' today"

[Verse 2]
Down along the cove
I spied my little bundle of joy
Down along the cove
I spied my little bundle of joy
She said, “Lord, have mercy, honey
I’m so glad you’re my boy!”

[Verse 3]
Down along the cove
We walked together hand in hand
Down along the cove
We walked together hand in hand
Ev’rybody watchin’ us a'go by
Knows we’re in love, yes, and they understand

[Verse 1]
Close your eyes, close the door
Ya' don’t have to worry anymore
I’ll be your baby tonight

[Verse 2]
Shut the light, shut the shade
Ya' don’t have to be afraid
I’ll be your baby tonight

[Bridge]
Well, that mockingbird’s gonna sail away
We’re gonna forget it
That big, fat moon is gonna shine like a spoon
But we’re gonna let it
You won’t regret it

[Verse 3]
Kick your shoes off, do not fear
Bring that bottle over here
I’ll be your baby tonight

[Intro: J. Cole]
Tick
This is for my niggas in the fourth quarter
Just watching that clock tick. Yeah

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
You said, "at what point do you start seeing bread?
Been out hustling for years, shoe box right under my bed
I move the work out my momma’s house, got me a little old crib
I always fantasize if I had went to college instead
Would I be happily married instead of broke and unwed?
My nigga made a major move I said I hope for the best
I told my sister as I kissed her cheek I’m better off dead
Fucking with this white, it’s all been downhill like a sled
Now listen, I understand they say you make your own bed
But tell me who supplied these sheets with this cheap ass thread
In denial about the feds, he can’t see past bread
Now do exactly what the man in the ski mask says, okay?
These are the times, survival my only crime
I gotta be on my grind, a lot of my homies gone
Inside of me Lord I know, it’s a lie that we gon' be fine
But momma I’m tired of crying, just lie to me one more time"

[Hook]
'Cause it’s crunch time
'Cause it’s crunch time
Shit real, man
A nigga got bills, man it’s crunch time
Shit real man a nigga got bills

[Verse 2: J Cole]
Look, scavenge these records, or these days MP3’s
Looking for the samples to put a nigga on MTV’s
This is for nigga’s with empty dreams and empty jeans
Still holding on to the word maybe
Cause this 9 to 5 shit is driving you stir-crazy
Coming home tired just to hear it from your lady
Hollering about your baby, need this and need that
And all you want is peace and quiet
Maybe some feedback, on these raps
'Cause labels ain’t hollering, and niggas ain't downloading
Nobody see your vision, they walking around blindfolded
All this time holding on to possibilities
You step outside, you smoke a blunt and then you feel the breeze
Fuck what they talking, it ain’t like life come often
Only thing worse than death is a regret-filled coffin
So try before you die or always wonder what if?
I thank the lord for this wonderful gift
Looking for strength in this crunch time

[Hook]
Looking for strength in the crunch time
This shit real dawg a nigga got bills dawg
It’s crunch time, yeah nigga it’s crunch time
This shit real dawg a nigga got bills dawg

[Outro: J. Cole]
I feel your pain nigga trust me
For all my nigga’s out there still trying to get it
Few nigga’s I know, few nigga’s I don’t know
Shout out to my nigga FilthE
Nervous Reck
Shout out to Marcus
My nigga I forgive you for all that shit you said
I understand my nigga
Still love, yeah

[Sample: Lauryn Hill]
One day, you're gonna understand...

[Intro: J. Cole]
Hey
Can I holla at you?
Let me holla at you

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Special, never forget the day I met you
We was destined for each other like a, son to his mother, or a
Sister and brother, man this bond is deep
We go a couple years and don't even speak
But know it's love though
Could never let 'em dirty your name
I got the utmost respect for you
Came back home and had to check for you
Word round town is you locked down
Some older nigga snatched you up gave you a rock now
Damn, hey could it be—
She like, "If you was me you wouldn't wait for me
Living fast and wouldn't mash the brakes for me"
Big city slicker nigga on a higher track
Bigger now but when she send a letter always write her back and
Time revealed, she feels that she settled too soon
While she see me go for mines and she admire that
We speak about time as if we could just buy it back
If only it was that simple, damn I miss you

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Can I holla at you?
Can I holla at you?
Ayy, let me holla at you!
Yeah, I know it's been a while but ain't no better time than now
Can I holla at you?
Can I holla at you?
Ayy, let me holla at you!
Yeah, I know it's been a while, but—

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
You betrayed me
The day you played my momma you played me
Can't believe I let you in my heart nigga
I shoulda, followed my instincts, a stranger in my house
Only five years old but sensed danger in my house
I was too young to scrap you, but damn if I ain't want to
I'm blowing up fast and I hope these words haunt you, uh
Thirteen years, knew you more than my real pops
Put me on to 'Pac and all the rappers that killed cops
Who woulda thought that you'd leave my momma high and dry
Last words to a bitch nigga "why you lie?"
Feeling bitter so these words might seem jumbled
When you left I watched that lady crumble
I know by now you probably a old man
But I still I feel I won't be satisfied until we throw hands
For all the ass whoppings
Heard you tryna talk, tell that punk don't call me
You ain't shit, and I'm scared it rubbed off on me

[Chorus: J. Cole]
May I holla at you?
I'll holla at you
Ayy, let me holla at you!
Yeah, I know it's been a while but ain't no better time than now
Can I holla at you?
Can I holla at you?
Ayy, let me holla at you!
Yeah, I know it's been a while, but—

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
I heard you on that shit, I hope it ain't true
Was hard to holla at you last time I came through
Could barely recognize you, naw nigga this ain't you
'Cause you ain't lookin' like that nigga that I once knew
And plus you act like you don't know me
We was homies, now you call me by my rap name
See me do my thing so you expected me to act strange
Ain't holla but you on my mind nigga
I don't forget the good times nigga
White tees in the club, jeans baggy as fuck
Sometimes I look back on my life, that was the happiest stuff
We had potential to be monumental, 'ville mentality
You know that old kill-or-be-killed mentality
I look at where you at now it's a, real fatality
'Cause where you s'posed to be is on top, close to me
Chasin' hoes like the old days, but now we overseas
Dawg, congratulations on your seed
Yo, my nigga

[Chorus: J. Cole]
Can I holla at you?
Can I holla at you?
Ayy, let me holla at you!
Yeah, I know it's been a while but ain't no better time than now
Can I holla at you?
Can I holla at you?
Ayy, let me holla at you!
Yeah, I know it's been a while, but—
Hey

This is the end station
But I can't move away from you
This is the edge of patience
But you won't prove yourself to me
Still you drain my soul and

[Chorus: Max Elto]
Even though it hurts, I can't slow down
Walls are closing in and I hit the ground
Whispers of tomorrow echo in my mind
Just one last time
Even though it hurts, I can't slow down
Walls are closing in and I hit the ground
Whispers of tomorrow echo in my mind
Just one last time
Just one last time
Just one last time

Then we're back to the start

[Verse 1]
She had a little daughter with her, it was cold out
She said “ah, I hate this motherfucker,” then she rolled out
He ain't answering his phone, she yells “what the fuck?!”
Then told her daughter “buckle up, yeah, that's for safety”
See she been stressin' lately
'Cause this nigga she done been with for the past two years
Is now the current reason for her last few tears
She text, he don't text back
When she see him she be tryna sex, he don't sex back
His heart be on jet black
She call, he don't call back, all he say is “fall back”
A nigga just need his space, so she headed to his place
'Cause she just got a call from her homegirl Rhonda
Who said he be creepin', he been fuckin' with Yolanda
“Yolanda?" "Yeah girl, Yolanda
Told you he ain't shit but you ain't listen, I was tryna–”
Click–hmmm, hung up that phone and hopped right up in that Honda
Headed to his crib, she said she fed up with this shit
“Thought this time this was the one, thought I got better at this shit
Pickin' out Mr. Right, stick it out through the fights
And long nights, for what? These niggas is all alike”
She gon' set it off, her daughter gon' witness it all tonight, damn

[Chorus]
Rise above, rise above
And you've got to
Rise above, rise above

[Verse 2]
She said she just finished school, could barely pay tuition
Now she teaches 7th grade, tryna make a difference
Aye, but the kids frustrate her, say that they don't listen
A ass like that, how the fuck they supposed to pay attention?
I'm fuckin' with you, but for real, she say they hopeless
A class full of jokesters, creatin' all the obstacles, impossible to focus
Little niggas barely read, tryna give them what they need
And they don't even try, one little boy, he caught her eye
'Cause he look just like her brother, she be havin' to call his mother
But she act like she don't care
What father? He ain't here
Now she frustrated, thinkin' that she just made the mistake of her life
Underpaid, be havin' to waitress at night
Six years of college down the drain, drinkin', tryna drown her pain
Party with her girls, feeling sorry for the world
'Cause ain't no hope for the youth, well ain't that the truth
When all your role models either rappin' or they hoop, damn

[Chorus]
Rise above, rise above
And you've got to
Rise above, rise above

[Verse 1]
Tears for ODB, drug-induced poetry
What’s the use? Strung-out from that drug abuse, woe is me
80's baby, so I know my pops was gettin’ high
In the 90's, me and mama barely gettin’ by
2000's I was concentratin’ more on gettin’ fly
Gettin’ bitches, gettin’ rich to get the shit I couldn’t buy
You know the story, you know my allegory
I was sent from Heaven with a set of horns, they’d better warn y’all
I’m here for more than just to kick some witty metaphors, dawg
This more of the type of shit you spit to set a war off
‘Cause niggas be poor, get money and still don’t know
Why the fuck they can’t cop a house, the system meant to lock us out
But I’m knockin’ down the door, strapped up with a four-four
Robin Hood, shit and yeah, I’m ‘hood rich
That’s good enough to stay in new kicks and a good whip
Get good head from a good bitch, I give two shits, I’ma tell you straight up

[Hook]
Straight up
Straight up, aye, any chance I’ma take it
Rather die before I fake it
They say life is what you make it, bitch
But I’m just tryna make it
Straight up
Straight up
Straight up, aye, any chance I’ma take it
Rather die before I fake it
They say life is what you make it, bitch

[Verse 2]
Lord have mercy on my soul, what I’ve done and what I’ve seen
My life has tumbled into that which only you could intervene
I put my heart in senseless things: money, bitches and street shit
Fascinated by beef, sad to say I won’t be shit
Grew up in this bitch without a pot to piss, no toilet
How ironic, I took a lot of shit, like a bottom bitch
Or a model chick, high off coke
They lockin’ sons up for less, I don’t care how y’all cope
But yet I still peddle this dope and these pills
I’ll never know how sittin’ comfy on that Oprah seat feels
More than likely be on Most Wanted posters, we still
Holdin’ on to old dreams of bein’ Hova, be real
We the forgotten souls, bottom of the totem poles
Left for dead, some niggas fled, people say they sold their souls
I just think they found a better way, Lord knows I never pray
But sometimes I be wishin’ I could levitate, I’ll take it straight up

[Hook]
Straight up
Straight up, aye, any chance I’ma take it
Rather die before I fake it
They say life is what you make it, bitch
But I’m just tryna make it
Straight up
Straight up
Straight up, aye, any chance I’ma take it
Rather die before I fake it
They say life is what you make it, bitch

[Outro]
Hey, hey
Cole World
2-6 faded out shit
For all my niggas still going through it
Yeah
Straight up
My niggas gotta learn something
It's 2012 nigga
And we're still killing ourselves
You don't know by now nigga
You ain't gon' never know
Real

[Intro]
Stay
Yeah
Hey
Groovy
Yeah
Yeah, hey
Stay

[Verse 1]
You can drop a "Wet Floor" sign down for the tears
God and my court date, the two things I fear
Man, they tryna give a nigga years
I'm tryna figure if I should even appear
Or should I skate town? Catch a Greyhound
Change my name right, catch a plane flight
Out the country, let them muh'fuckers hunt me
Come catch me if you want me, know they'll lock me if I stay (Stay)
But where I'ma run to?
I got a good girl, we got a son, too
And all we went through, we ain't see eye-to-eye
But what you told me way back, you was a ride-or-die
So if they give me one, or if they give me two
Or if a nigga gotta sit down and do a few
Before I go, baby, I gotta know, what would you do?
Would you find someone new or would you stay? (Stay)
Like the hoes when they lay with me
Puppy eyes when I go sayin', "Stay with me"
Aw, girl, you bad as hell and, yeah, I'd love to
But see, I got a girl I'm really makin' love to
Therefore I'm feelin' a lot more guilty when I rub you
That's why I skip all of that kissin' when I fuck you
Flush the condom down the toilet then I skate
I had you, but you can't have me, I never stay

[Interlude]
Stay
Yeah
Yeah, that's the one
(Stay)
Yeah
Stay

[Verse 2]
Ha! Life in a hometown
'Fore I could take a step, I'm gettin' grown now
And startin' to notice that I see the same hoes 'round
Guess they had to go 'round, my raps is profound
I got the flows, but yet a nigga ain't got no sound
Copped a beat machine, I'm cookin' up my own now
Got my mind on the city where it goes down
See, if I'ma get to where I'm goin', then I can't stay (Stay)
Although I love it here
I'll be damned if I sit around another year
Dreamin' dreams, hopin' somehow that they just appear
The hardest part of leavin' is to know my mother here
Oh, but I'm comin' back, oh boy, believe that
To show the little niggas, boy, you can achieve that
Got the city on my shoulders, piggyback
Hello, my name is Cole and I'm here to stay

[Outro]
Stay
Hey
(Stay)
Stay

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Livin' that life, livin' that life
Under them street lights
But it ain't bright enough to show me where I'm going
But I still find my way, and when I do I keep going, and I'm
A nigga with stripes
Try me and your family don't sleep right
Didn't think I was tough enough to make it on my own
But I could get through anything if I done made it through the storm, and umm
I'm killing that night, killing that night
Life on that East Side
Leather on chrome, television with the phone
And the top is so gone
I do it so right, I do it so right
They want me to be like
I'm in the zone, bad to the bone
Correct me if I'm wrong

[Hook]
Times is hard as it is
That's why I got guns and my guns got kids
And all I wanna do is handle my biz
And all I'm tryna do is whatever I did, Dear Lord
Everyday I've been praying to you
I hope You're hearing everything that I'm saying to You
I get money, money, money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money, money, money

[Verse 2]
I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying
I'm dying to get over
And once I get over, good Lord I know
That all my drama's over
And I thank you
And I be with them niggas
And ain't none of them broke
They ride around with that rope, and they'll hang you
And leave your mama to cope
On that Holiday note
Damnnnn,Then they put a sign on the do'
Saying you don't know shit
Or else you dying in court, mannnnn
You gotta know how it go
Or else you could end up in another bump in the road
You see

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
A prisoner of this war
We call America
Where the President is the enemy
And he already won, damn
And Armageddon and depressions already begun
So excuse my expression
But it's my aggression
Cause I'm gonna spread you some
I know my people tired
Of all the crying, all the dying
All the time, we just trying
To get our mind off the crime and find somethin' to find
And did I mention not to mention
That my life is on the line
Give me light, and I'mma shine
Give me rope, and I'mma climb
I'm hoping that the Gates'll be open when I arrive
Until then, I'm alive
My job is to survive
So Lord, keep me in your eyes
I'm tryna say

Intellectually organic herbal organism musicians tied at the mind combined energies circu…
Lating the rhythm cyclist? kennelist? manuscripts flipped with lyrical spheres
Grasping the axis of forever back
To the umbilicoda origin
When there was more to men, heart and soul
The cre…ation of civilization is my goal stroll
Down the avenue searching for something new
Didn’t know that I possessed the power to create one of the chosen few
It could be you
Just start asking yourself why you exist
And eventually there will emerge a passion
This is the moment so grasp it for what it’s worth
The musical current life line
I ride the, wave and surf
On a temper frequency unfolding mysteries
Obvious dominant prominent spectacles of personal agility
That I might lack physically, but spiritually remain intact
Incense caresses the air as the moment is captured on tracks

Chorus (second time 3rd line Whoever said that conscious rhymers can’t be flossin’?)
Hey wassup yall?
Let’s get this party hoppin
Get off that wall and have fun fool we steady rockin
Don’t take life so serious, get that neck knockin’?
Everybody get up grab their collar and pop it

To the 4:4 count I speak my, life in rhythm
Intricate intellect emerge inside of yo your stereo system
You listen as the speakers bumpin’
Thump with sound, from the heart hear it to yo ears and in time
I have found, my soul mate in words and nouns, profound in context
Delivering my passion, speaking on the complex
When the simple minded symphonies smile and sedate you
I speak on subjects that we can all relate to
Remaining faithful, following my faith and belief
That we are all one tree, branched off on separate leaves
I, reach in speech, to seek and preach my life
Teach to each who feel the beat technique of sight
You think that currency will enhance your life
But until you gain knowledge of self, money will overshadow the lie
And that ain’t tight, at all
Ego’s what clouds your vision
Your center mechanism who knows what to the day how fresh you will fall

Chrous x2 3rd line Whoever said that conscious rhymers can’t be flossin’?
Stay true to the truth and aware of the fiction
Love life for what it is, appreciate music and listen with open ears
Open eyes, see through the disguise
Congruent with the divine
Meditation will take you high
Internal instinct can sync with social
Independent art, do your part, show support to locals
Use your trifocal, of your, third eye optical
Discuss meta of the universe, and philosophical
I know dependency seems impossible to break
But I know that from reading that mistake’s a clear mind state
Will elevate your being higher than any drug
Using moderation respect your breath and show love to the
Spirit above, and develop, a greater understanding of this life force
You call your own and embellish
The moment in search for your objective
I’m not preaching, just speaking on my life from my perspective

Chorus x3

[Verse 1]
Has anyone here seen my old friend Abraham?
Can you tell me where he's gone?
Oh, he freed a lot of people
But it seems the good die young, yeah
I just looked around and he was gone

[Verse 2]
Has anyone here seen my old friend John?
Can you tell me where he's gone?
You know, he freed a lot of people
But it seems the good die young, yeah
I just looked around and he was gone

[Verse 3]
Has anybody here seen my old friend Martin?
Can you tell me where he's gone?
He freed a lot of people

I just looked around and he was gone

[Verse 4]
Has anybody here seen my friend Bobby?
Can you tell me where he's gone?
You know, he freed a lot of people
But the good, they die young, yeah
I just looked around and he was gone

Oh I, just looked around and they were gone

[Verse 1: Brian Wilson]
Where did your long hair go?
Where is the girl I used to know?
How could you lose that happy glow?
Oh, Caroline, no

[Verse 2: Brian Wilson]
Who took that look away?
I remember how you used to say
You'd never change, but that's not true

[Bridge: Brian Wilson]
Oh, Caroline, you
Break my heart
I want to go and cry
It's so sad to watch a sweet thing die
Oh, Caroline, why?

[Verse 3: Brian Wilson]
Could I ever find in you again
The things that made me love you so much then?
Could we ever bring 'em back once they have gone?
Oh, Caroline, no

[Verse: Paul McCartney & John Lennon, Paul McCartney]
Love, love me do
You know I love you
I'll always be true
So please, love me do
Whoa, love me do

[Verse: Paul McCartney & John Lennon, Paul McCartney]
Love, love me do
You know I love you
I'll always be true
So please, love me do
Whoa, love me do

[Bridge: Paul McCartney & John Lennon, Paul McCartney]
Someone to love
Somebody new
Someone to love
Someone like you

[Verse: Paul McCartney & John Lennon, Paul McCartney]
Love, love me do
You know I love you
I'll always be true
So please, love me do
Whoa, love me do

[Harmonica Solo: John Lennon]

[Verse: Paul McCartney & John Lennon, Paul McCartney]
Love, love me do
You know I love you
I'll always be true
So please, love me do
Whoa, love me do
Yeah, love me do

[Outro: Paul McCartney]
Whoa, oh, love me do
Yeah, love me do
Why don't you love me do?
Helpless she lies across the stairs
Haunting your days, consuming your prayers
There will be healing but don't force this girl to stand
As she's counting the ceilings with pale voice and trembling hands

[Chorus]
You told me life was long but now that it's gone
You find yourself on top as the leader of a flock
Called to be a rock for those below

Whispered notes from the piano in the corner of the room
Hold your throat is that healing that you're hearing in her tune
Wanting change but loving her just as she lies
Is the burden of a man who's built his life on love

[Chorus]

I'll be locked up and stored
In the lavender ward
Cause my mind is just like hers
Just as broken just as crippled just as burned
And then I find myself on top as the leader of the flock
Called to be a rock for those below

[Verse 1]
I love you, 'cause you tell me things I want to know
And it's true that it really only goes to show
That I know that I—I, I, I
Should never, never, never be blue

[Verse 2]
Now you're mine, my happiness still makes me cry
And in time, you'll understand the reason why
If I cry, it's not because I'm sad
But you're the only love that I've ever had

[Bridge]
I can't believe it's happened to me
I can't conceive of any more—misery

[Chorus]
Ask me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you

[Verse 3]
I love you, 'cause you tell me things I want to know
And it's true that it really only goes to show
That I know that I—I, I, I
Should never, never, never be blue

[Chorus]
Ask me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you

[Bridge]
I can't believe it's happened to me
I can't conceive of any more—misery

[Outro]
Ask me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you
You
You

[Verse 1]
We came to the end it seems you had heard
As we walked the city streets you never said a word
When we finally sat down your eyes were full of spite
I was desperate, I was weak, I could not put up a fight

[Chorus]
But where are you now?
Where are you now?
Do you ever think of me
In the quiet, in the crowd?

[Verse 2]
You were strangely less in pain than you were cold
Triumphant in your mind of the logic that you hold
You said no one would ever know the love that we had shared
As I took my leave to go it was clear you didn't care

[Chorus]
But where are you now?
Where are you now?
Do you ever think of me
In the quiet, in the crowd?
But where are you now?
Where are you now?
Do you ever think of me
In the quiet, in the crowd?

[Verse 3]
And I hear of your coming and your going in the town
I hear stories of your smile, I hear stories of your frown
And the darkness can descend we can relish all the pain
But I know that's what you love cause you know I love the same

[Chorus]
But where are you now?
Where are you now?
Do you ever think of me
In the quiet, in the crowd?

But where are you now?
Where are you now?
Do you ever think of me
In the quiet, in the crowd?

But where are you now?
Where are you now?
Do you ever think of me
In the quiet, in the crowd?

[Verse 1]
Last night, I said these words to my girl
I know you never even try, girl

[Chorus]
Come on (Come on), come on (Come on)
Come on (Come on), come on (Come on)
Please please me, whoa yeah, like I please you

[Verse 2]
You don't need me to show the way, love
Why do I always have to say, love?

[Chorus]
Come on (Come on), Come on (Come on)
Come on (Come on), Come on (Come on)
Please please me, whoa yeah, like I please you

[Bridge]
I don't want to sound complaining
But you know there's always rain in my heart (In my heart)
I do all the pleasing with you it's so hard to reason
With you, whoa yeah, why do you make me blue?

[Verse 3]
Last night, I said these words to my girl
I know I never even try girl

[Chorus]
Come on (Come on) Come on (Come on)
Come on (Come on) Come on (Come on)

Me, whoa yeah, like I please you

[Intro]
The world is treating me bad, misery

[Verse 1]
I'm the kind of guy
Who never used to cry
The world is treating me bad, misery

[Verse 2]
I've lost her now for sure
I won't see her no more
It's gonna be a drag, misery

[Bridge]
I'll remember all the little things we've done
Can't she see she'll always be the only one, only one

[Verse 3]
Send her back to me
'Cause everyone can see
Without her I will be in misery

[Bridge]
I'll remember all the little things we've done
She’ll remember and she’ll miss her only one, lonely one

[Verse 3 - Outro]
Send her back to me
'Cause everyone can see
Without her I will be in misery (Oh oh oh)
In misery (Ooh ooh)
My misery (La la la la la la)
Misery

[Intro]
You'll never know how much I really love you
You'll never know how much I really care

[Verse]
Listen
Do you want to know a secret?
Do you promise not to tell? Whoa oh, oh
Closer
Let me whisper in your ear
Say the words you long to hear
I'm in love with you, ooh

[Verse]
Listen (Do da do)
Do you want to know a secret? (Do da do)

Nobody knows, just we two

[Verse]
Listen (Do da do)
Do you want to know a secret? (Do da do)
Do you promise not to tell? (Do da do) Whoa oh, oh
Closer (Do da do)
Let me whisper in your ear (Do da do)
Say the words you long to hear
I'm in love with you, ooh
Ooh

[Intro]
A taste of honey!
Tasting much sweeter than wine

[Verse 1]
I dream of your first kiss, and then
I feel upon my lips again

[Chorus]
A taste of honey (A taste of honey)
Tasting much sweeter than wine

[Bridge]
I will return, yes I will return
I'll come back for the honey and you

[Verse 2]
Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart
There lingers still, though we're far apart

[Chorus]
A taste of honey (A taste of honey)
Tasting much sweeter than wine

[Bridge]
I will return, yes I will return
I'll come back (He'll come back) for the honey (For the honey) and you

[Verse 1]
There—
There's a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time when I'm alone

[Verse 2]
I think of you
And things you do
Go round my head
The things you said
Like "I love only you"

[Bridge]
In my mind there's no sorrow
Don't you know that it's so
There'll be no sad tomorrow
Don't you know that it's so

[Verse 3]
There is a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time when I'm alone

[Outro]
There's a place
There's a place
There's a place
There's a place

And I got deep pockets and she got a deep throat
We watch out for police that be in street clothes

Ay, they be like B.o.B, (What?) "how you do that in Atlanta?" (Yes)
She said she like my dougie now she jigging off my grammar
Well basically she got it down and dirty like Dianna
I got the Cali puff, you can't find that in Atlanta
I hit her with that flex till she getting preg
You heard what I said, hit her with a test, then she know what's next
I teach ya how to dougie, teach ya how to swag walk
I ain't talking about that swag that come in a plastic bag (Oh no)
This is ain't a infomercial, this does not come with a tag
I'll take the game, beat it up, and leave it on this bag
B.o.B. up on this track, in a Jason mask, so I'm finna hack
Everything in sight, nothing's left in tact
I'm, stuck to the seat with no seat-belt
Don't worry about me cause I don't need help
Ride around down A-Town up 85 with a phone on my hip
I'm, stuck to the seat with no seat-belt
Don't worry about me cause I don't need help
Ride around down A-Town up 85 with a phone on my hip, I'm gone
But my Dougie is strong, I'm ruggish like bone
And I'm gone like a buggie but I boogie like this song
And this bitch is my cologne, so you know I'm in the zone
My name is Bobby Ray and I'm a teach you how to flow

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Fishscale all over my motherfucking apartment
Damn, I got dope all on garment
Cooking dope in Trestletree, move the trap to Sun Valley
Now I’m in Gresham housing, money piling, money piling
I’m so fresh, don’t need a stylist
Buy a rental car and tint the windows
Buy a car, stop the mileage
Stuffing bricks all in a fender
Stuffing P's in the spare tire
Gucci ain’t real, you a damn liar
Say yo nigga a live wire
I'ma short circuit nigga wifi
Serve more chicken than Popeye’s
Strong purp, Popeye
One day I might die, but not soon because I’m strapped fool
I got old schools, I got new schools, I got one rule — don’t cross me
Red bottoms on my feet, courtside next to Spike Lee
Baby, I’m Spike Lee

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
All the purple, all the white
All this green, taking a flight
Up all night, nigga getting shot
Nigga getting popped, Big Guwap
Drop my top, suicide doors
Pouring up fours, just bought me a Rolls
Money over hoes, recycling your clothes
You niggas going broke, I’m sure of my goals
Wop!

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
Little Mexico we cook up dope
If a nigga broke, we sell him soap
I can see it in your eyes that you niggas going broke
‘Cause you don’t got no pres no mo’
Yo bitches gone, yo money getting low
He used to buy bricks, now he buyin’ a fo’
Money over bitches, can’t wife no ho
Money over everything, can’t go broke
We blowing gas, smoking on flights
Place your order, I’ll be there over night
I’m talking private planes
Hundred bricks of white
Still a young nigga, I live a mob life
(Let’s go!)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
All the purple, all the white
All this green, taking a flight
Up all night, nigga getting shot
Nigga getting popped, Big Guwap
Drop my top, suicide doors
Pouring up fours, just bought me a Rolls
Money over hoes, recycling your clothes
You niggas going broke, I’m sure of my goals
Wop!

[Verse 1]
Fat man looking in a blade of steel
Thin man looking at his last meal
Hollow man looking in a cotton field
For dignity

[Verse 2]
Wise man looking in a blade of grass
Young man looking in the shadows that pass
Poor man looking through painted glass
For dignity

[Verse 3]
Somebody got murdered on New Year’s Eve
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave
I went into the city, went into the town
Went into the land of the midnight sun

[Verse 4]
Searching high, searching low
Searching everywhere I know
Asking the cops wherever I go
Have you seen dignity?

[Verse 5]
Blind man breaking out of a trance
Puts both his hands in the pockets of chance
Hoping to find one circumstance
Of dignity

[Verse 6]
I went to the wedding of Mary Lou
She said, “I don’t want nobody see me talking to you”
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew
About dignity

[Verse 7]
I went down where the vultures feed
I would’ve gone deeper, but there wasn’t any need
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
Wasn’t any difference to me

[Verse 8]
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade
House on fire, debts unpaid
Gonna stand at the window, going to ask the maid
Have you seen dignity?

[Verse 9]
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors
Looking into the lost forgotten years
For dignity

[Verse 10]
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues
Said he’d give me information if his name wasn’t used
He wanted money up front, said he was abused
By dignity

[Verse 11]
Footprints running across the silver sand
Steps going down into tattoo land
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
In the border towns of despair

[Verse 12]
Got no place to fade, got no coat
I’m on the rolling river in a jerkin boat
Trying to read a note somebody wrote
About dignity

[Verse 13]
Sick man looking for the doctor’s cure
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
And into every masterpiece of literature
For dignity

[Verse 14]
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin
Bites the bullet and he looks within
For dignity

[Verse 15]
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed
Dignity never been photographed
I went into the red, went into the black
Into the valley of dry bone dreams

[Verse 16]
So many roads, so much at stake
So many dead ends, I’m at the edge of the lake
Sometimes I wonder what it’s going to take
To find dignity

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Back to the future
Yo all I need is just a snippet of the orchestra
And now we rockin' leathers and my team is dippin' Porsches
Trained in special forces I remain the same
Modeling the rugby with the horses on it, I'm lookin' gorgeous on it
A light gallop
The suit is seersucker like a scallop
Cop the land and over time you see the price pile up
My life style the dream of money though it feel nostalgic
It's sunny skies and good karma that keep the cheese surrounding (You'd be astounded motha'fucka)
I'm known to kick it like I'm Ronaldinho
My rhymes are spicy as a jalapeño, '87 fine Yovino
Cash the drift, one leaf wrap up the reefer
Now the vision seem clear, just like the cover on the beeper
Zero-10, 7:15, month of July
Shorty blowing on my dick my eyes closed, smoke in the sky
Exhale, right through my nose
North bound, headed for gods
First check, a quarter mil
Half that, split with the squad, kid

[Interlude: Action Bronson]
Damn it's like, I don't even know which way to go no more man
Just reflecting on my life now
I gotta get with it
Yo

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
Deep reflection, smoking drug as the wind blow
Ash the $50 marijuana out the window
My golden aura shine, rising past the borderline
I crush the grape like a Greek to make a gorgeous wine
Open the Dutch and let tobacco fly through the wind, the saga begin
.38 parts, vivid like photography lens
Soon to see me dip mahogany Benz
I'm into quality, monogamy with all of my gems
That means I'm, true to it
The beat I give the flu to it
Or maybe AIDS if I had it, 'cause I'm a fuckin' addict
I'm on the terrace drinkin' wine and eatin' fuckin' rabbit
To cleanse the palate, lemon segments tossed up in the salad
Spark the pepper, my mind is like a Harvard lecture
Bronsolini going Persian on the carpet texture
Ancient Roman on the architecture
Straight outta' mothafuckin' Queens, my team, we got the heart to wet ya'
A Dutch Master like Robben and Sneijder, strike like a viper
The bottom of shoe tap like a typewriter
Pipe slider, I'm a fuckin' ninja warrior
We do the drug and eat ćevapi in Astoria
I ride zebras all through the jungle, take rock and never fumble
Shoot gun, right from the waist, slide piece to make it mumble on the come through
Several grams are stuffed inside the grundle
Saw the goal line, went airborne and did a tumble
Then I landed on my feet the two G's, impressed the sand
Wipe sweat, right off my brow, next door, dig up the lamb
That's been roasting over seven hours
Bronsolini smoke the deadly sour
A fuckin' winner like I'm Kenny Powers

[Verse 1]
They shot my homie for nothing, killed my homie for nothing
I smoke blunts everyday, to try to wish it didn't happen
But I can't bring him back, cause I am only a mortal
People think I'm a god, but to me I'm only normal
I used to trap on the corner, tracksuit with the thermal
I had that TEC in the bushes, run up on me I burn you
Folks they come to Atlanta, just to ride through my zone
Wanna see where I trapped at, they wanna see what's my home
In the place that I said, everything that I meant
I got so many pounds in the apartment think I got dreads
I got money in the bed, so I sleep with the bread
If you play with Bricksquad, them might take off your head

[Chorus]
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high
I'm so high, baby girl I'm so high
She get high, your baby girl, she get fucked up
And he get high, you know that nigga fuck his nose up
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high
She so high, but bitch with me so she good night
And you so broke, you looking at us with all this ice

[Verse 2]
Bitch I bigger pay her or get bigger paid, everyday is a bigger day
Bigger nigga get a bigger gun, hit his ass in his bigger face
Bigga Rankin and I fuck with him, half the niggas he with I don't like
That young nigga 'bout trigger play, and my section looks just like nigga day
Reiterate I'm 'bout pistol play, FN what my pistol say
Shoulder deep in this cocaine, but nigga I can hold the weight
Appraise me, I'm a mill' today
A mill, and a mill, made a mill today
Say you wanna do a show, what's the rate?
Told a nigga fifty with a stiff face
Smoking on kush and I'm drinking on grape's, I feel just like I'm Pimp C
Say Gucci Mane you a murderer, so you can't get a sponsor like Pepsi
Say Pepsi, fuck you, cause I fuck with the Coca-Cola anyway
On check day it's booming, but it's real slow on rent day

[Chorus]
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high
I'm so high, baby girl I'm so high
She get high, your baby girl, she get fucked up
And he get high, you know that nigga fuck his nose up
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high
She so high, but bitch with me so she good night
And you so broke, you looking at us with all this ice

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
It's about feeling
The combination of young people, drugs, a fairly sexually charged social environment, and syncopated music
Is just all designed to draw you into you and your friends and your scene, and your hood, and your place in the cosmos
And not sell you out as a consumer
To a Hollywood or Manhattan-manufactured forms of entertainment (It's Guwop)
Huh

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm a real nigga, talkin' 'bout what I really have (Legend)
'Cause I fucked a nigga bitch, that's why he really mad (Damn)
Hit a nigga in his head, I be really glad (Bah)
Since the day I lost Dunk, I been really sad
A nigga make a hit and dip, will he really last?
A nigga say he hold you down, but will he really blast?
They say I'm worth fifteen M's, but that ain't really shit (No)
And I ain't content with what I got, got to be really rich
Sold dope on the really, was broke on the really
If you really wanna get it, then you know I'm with it
Really wanna go to war with me, not really
If you wanna get it, then you gonna get it
You worth a mil', not really really
I ain't all in your business
If it's not your girl, not really really
Then why it's hurting your feelings? (It's Gucci)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & Young Dolph]
My young niggas, they really ready, them straps cocked already
These rap niggas all really scary, talk loud, but ain't ready
We tote choppers like military, niggas gotta get passes
Your girl with me, you real embarrassed, damn, I fucked with your marriage (Really)
My young niggas, they really ready, them straps cocked already (Woah)
These rap niggas all really scary (What up, Gucci?), talk loud, but ain't ready (I swear)
We tote choppers like military, niggas gotta get passes (Uh-huh)
Your girl with me, you real embarrassed, damn, I fucked with your marriage (It's Dolph, really)

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
On the real, these rappers pussies, nah, really, straight up (For real)
But meanwhile, I'm in my traphouse with 'bout six different flavors
But fuck that, let's get to it (Yeah)
Took out my scale, broke down the bale, and my clientele ran straight through it
Drinkin' mud, riding through the city, yup
Sellin' P's out the coupe really, yup
Paid 15K for my SS and invested another fifty, yup
These rap niggas, they don't wanna see me, nah
Got your bitch with me taking off her drawers
Smokin' weed and laughin', burnin' rubber while I'm runnin' from the law
Really, fuck you, nigga, come get me (Fuck you)
I'm a Castalia nigga and all we do is get money, you feel me? (Castalia, really?)
Know it's two Glocks with me, yup
Got that boy Guwop with me, yup (Ayy)
Downtown rooftop chilling, yup
Quarter mil' on the floor, really

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & Young Dolph]
My young niggas, they really ready, them straps cocked already (Woah)
These rap niggas all really scary, talk loud, but ain't ready (It's Dolph)
We tote choppers like military, niggas gotta get passes
Your girl with me, you real embarrassed, damn, I fucked with your marriage (Really)
My young niggas, they really ready, them straps cocked already
These rap niggas all really scary, talk loud, but ain't ready (Really)
We tote choppers like military, niggas gotta get passes (Passes)
Your girl with me, you real embarrassed, damn, I fucked with your marriage (Really)

[Verse 3: Rulet 1017]
Bee, I'm bickin' back and I'm boolin' (Boolin')
Drop the top and it's foolish (It's foolish)
Finessin' game with your main bitch (Turn up)
Now my pockets is stupid (Stupid)
Fuck with Gucci, get your issue (Issue)
You pussies soft like tissue
Hundred K'll get you knocked out (Knocked out)
Put me in the ring, get boxed out
So I jump on the stage, get the team real hype (I'm hype)
Gucci throw a cup and the whole squad fight (Turn up)
Bottles on me, so we pourin' all night (Squad)
Nigga get to trippin', switch up, fight night (Squad)
I'm jumping out that coupe (That coupe), I lost my damn roof (That roof)
Thank God these boys so fly, we don't need no parachute (We gone)
So I'm chasing after figures (We runnin'), squeezin' on these triggers (Triggers)
Bank account six figures (Yeah), kick my feet up, Louie slippers (Guap)
Vacation in the Hamptons (Hamptons), rockstar, Marilyn Manson (yeah)
All for that check, I'll hold a nigga ransom (Squad)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
My young niggas, they really ready, them straps cocked already (Really)
These rap niggas all really scary, talk loud, but ain't ready (Really)
We tote choppers like military, niggas gotta get passes (Passes)
Your girl with me, you real embarrassed, damn, I fucked with your marriage (Really)
My young niggas, they really ready, them straps cocked already (Already)
These rap niggas all really scary, talk loud, but ain't ready (Really)
We tote choppers like military, niggas gotta get passes (Passes)
Your girl with me, you real embarrassed, damn, I fucked with your marriage (Really)

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I done robbed niggas, been robbed nigga
I done shot niggas, been shot at nigga
If you love your niggas you fire for your niggas
Cause Waka my nigga, I'd die for my nigga
Spent seventy-five on this Rollie'
Tote a .45 like the police
If I'm a ho, come show me
Big Gucci O.G. like Tookie
If you told her why just like Pookie
Then I'mma gonna have to kill a junky
Since Nino snitched at the end my nigga he cannot be my role model
Like Big Meech, like John Gotti
I ain't never told on nobody
Got tear drops, but nobody
Blew your brains out your head to make you think about it
I'm cancerous, I'm the dangerous
And I don't need no nigga, I can handle this
I got good aim, I don't panic quick
And I have a nigga funeral candle lit
Like Dunk say, you wanna rob nigga, well me and you probably on the same shit
This ain't a lick, and I don't know you
'Fore I shake your hand, I put a hole in it

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
You ain't gonna bring me my bread nigga
Can't interfere with my money
I'mma put change on your head nigga
Can't interfere with my money
Heard you snitching to the feds nigga
They can't interfere with my money
I ain't got time to be playing with ya'
Can't interfere with my money
Heard you ain't got no money no more
But it can't interfere with my money
Say that you running up on me nigga
But it can't interfere with my money
Fronted you some and you still ain't paid
But it can't interfere with my money
Like I'm a bitch, I'm gon' let you play
But it can't interfere with my money

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Treat the rap game like the trap game, so you can't interfere with my money
Treat these rap niggas like little kids, when you do wrong you get punished
I'm an M.C. but I'm from the street, these fuck niggas ain't one-hundred
Got monkey nuts on my handgun, so my nine hold 'bout two-hundred
Seen a YouTube, 'bout a nigga saying that he gon' do me then run it
But the only thing he gon' do is start running when I start gunning
'Fore I'm talking to you, I'm busting at you, this Russian prolly crack your bone marrow
Let your brother be your pallbearer, shoot you in your head like cousin Harold
All my niggas got pistols on 'em, all my guns got extensions on 'em
Turned your favorite rapper to a victim, homie
And no witnesses to be snitching on me
Say the nigga died with his pistol on him
Crime scene, taking pictures of him
Had a wake funeral and a shower for him
When you see the nigga, lay a flower on him

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
You ain't gonna bring me my bread nigga
Can't interfere with my money
I'mma put change on your head nigga
Can't interfere with my money
Heard you snitching to the feds nigga
They can't interfere with my money
I ain't got time to be playing with ya'
Can't interfere with my money
Heard you ain't got no money no more
But it can't interfere with my money
Say that you running up on me nigga
But it can't interfere with my money
Fronted you some and you still ain't paid
But it can't interfere with my money
Like I'm a bitch, I'm gon' let you play
But it can't interfere with my money

[Verse 3: OG Boo Dirty]
Gangster as I wanna be, mobbing to the third degree
No nigga gon' fuck with me, I keep them shooters 'round me
And I don't really fuck with nigga, why the fuck they trying me?
My hand where that nine be, two shots through your eyelids
These rap niggas getting distorted, that's why I'm glad I'm a trap nigga
Million dollar strap nigga, brains in your lap nigga
O.G. of my city, check my status nigga
Shooting like John Paxson nigga
My goons automatic nigga
When it's time to ride out, my niggas don't hide out
Choppers in the hideout, time to break the iron out
We killing for them rubber bands, bombing like Afghanistan
Pull up in a Hummer truck, spit fire out like I'm drummer boy

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
You ain't gonna bring me my bread nigga
Can't interfere with my money
I'mma put change on your head nigga
Can't interfere with my money
Heard you snitching to the feds nigga
They can't interfere with my money
I ain't got time to be playing with ya'
Can't interfere with my money
Heard you ain't got no money no more
But it can't interfere with my money
Say that you running up on me nigga
But it can't interfere with my money
Fronted you some and you still ain't paid
But it can't interfere with my money
Like I'm a bitch, I'm gon' let you play
But it can't interfere with my money

[Verse 1]
I talk so much shit I wake a dead man up
And I'm the meth man, you better call Redman up
I'm by myself man, and yes I ran my bread back up
You'll have better luck tryna rob a Brinks bank truck
Eight ounces and a Crush soda
Last month I damn near smoked a Range Rover
I buy a pint, crack the seal, and put a straw in it
I'm drinking raw out the jar, caviar sipping
I might need a new prescription
These young hoes fucking senior citizens
Dad, your little sister is granddaddy mistress, sad
Secretary sucking politicians, you mad
You know that Mr. cheating on his Mrs
Remember when I could just take a bitch to Wendy's
But now these hoes say they wanna go to Sicily
But bitch you must be silly, wanna go to Piccadilly
Cause I really feel you fake as hell, like Milli Vanilli

[Hook]
These hoes, must of these niggas go broke for these hoes
Big bad bully but he beat for these hoes
Married thirty years but he sleep with these hoes
Spending all this money, going out to eat
M.O.B. means money over bitches
These niggas say they real, but they just a bunch of bitches
Fuck the bedroom, point me to the kitchen
Baby girl, where you was when I was water wippin'
When I was water wippin', when I was water wippin'
Baby girl, where you was when I was water wippin'
When I was water wippin', when I was water wippin'
Fuck the bedroom, point me to the kitchen

[Verse 2]
Fuck the bedroom, point me to the kitchen
So many chickens in my kitchen got my palms itching
You sucking a rich nigga dick, you in a good position
You say your baby daddy broke? Bitch you really tripping
What's wrong with you, what kind of life you living?
You wanna ball, hit the mall, or just eat Church's Chicken
Gucci be really pimping, I need just thirty minutes
And if you cool baby we could fuck every Wednesday
But you must pay attention, baby you got to listen
The first rule, that you cannot have hoes in my business
You know I ball relentless, pull up in Benz and Bentley's
And I don't wanna meet your daddy, I ain't fucking friendly
I had three-hundred-fifty-thousand, I was only twenty
Your baby daddy broke, I bury his ass in fucking twenties
Yeah I'm a fat nigga, but all I ride is fucking skinny's
And I don't wanna fuck that bitch cause she too fucking skinny

[Hook]
These hoes, must of these niggas go broke for these hoes
Big bad bully but he beat for these hoes
Married thirty years but he sleep with these hoes
Spending all this money, going out to eat
M.O.B. means money over bitches
These niggas say they real, but they just a bunch of bitches
Fuck the bedroom, point me to the kitchen
Baby girl, where you was when I was water wippin'
When I was water wippin', when I was water wippin'
Baby girl, where you was when I was water wippin'
When I was water wippin', when I was water wippin'
Fuck the bedroom, point me to the kitchen
Hey yo
Action Bronson
Solace
Motha fuckin PF Cuttin
You 'bout to hear some shit

[Verse 1:Action Bronson]
Hey yo
Fry the flamingo when we dining, planters on the table
Booby shining the rarest diamonds studs around the navel
Hop out the whip both feet touch at the same time
Greenbacks consolidated with the grey nine
Red dawn cook up the fishes with the heads on
He fanned the Bronsonelli known for never folding bread wrong
Every bill facing the same direction
Shit on my feet, split up the middle
Desert wiley with the suede complexion
Fill the glass, toast the brew, smoke the basil soup
Cop and crash a hazel coup, take a nasal too
Yes indeed I smoke minoras with my people
I'm rolling up the trilogy before I light the fucking sequel
Peppers are grilled with the diploma, the smoker
The apple-wood chip thirty-eight enhancing the aroma
'95 Karl Kani on the vest set
Death threats will get your cut ripped and your chest wet

[Hook: Action Bronson & Solace]
Exquisite lyric from the vocal so we hold it down
It's word wizardry the queens niggas hold the crown
Fresh out the ground got the hookers with the golden gowns
Profound sound, pound for pound we known the go around

[Verse 2: Solace]
My every move is major, incredible intrepid flow
Rep your soul's a spectacle, but's that's just true to nature
Now who's the crew to lace ya? Timeless, the Truth will amaze ya
Euphemisms be like euthanasia we through with the flavors
I read your blueprint watch you take the foolish steps
You don't deserve my cents if you was UNICEF
The Judas left the Southern sun and god for thirty pieces
All my thesis to the wisest recognize the dirty features
We working on getting work in
You hear the shotty bursting with Lonnie be lurking
Say your prayers like Donnie McClurkin
We fly to the grave site like kamikazes
And maintain the same brain frame as Hammurabi's
So paraprofessionals know I'm a be skeptical
Never handing out respect unless it's exceptional
Yo just be strategic or get broke into pieces
By murderous paragraphs that'll leave you paraplegic

[Hook X2]

[Chorus 1: J. Cole]
Got me up all night
All I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night
Constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night
Down-and-out with these love songs
She got me up all night
Drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
All I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
Constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
Down-and-out with these love songs
She got me open all night (Uh-huh)
Got me open all night, hey

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Okay, back when I was sleeping in my mama crib
Or even back when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Paying seventeen hundred for the rent, money well spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?
Had a thing for ya, even wrote the song "Dreams" for ya
‘Cause I had dreams for ya, thoughts of a ring for ya
Childish shit, you know child and shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home, I'm grown now, and the city's my throne now, huh
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got Kriss Kross'd: totally crossed out
‘Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks crying ‘cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spill on me, while I feel on you, I'm sayin'—

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya

[Chorus 2: J. Cole]
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are
All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Well, this has got to be the longest crush ever
If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever and
Fuck it, I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wife'ing in the club, man, my homies gon' disown a nigga
Like, "Give me twenty dollars, dollars!"
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college?
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you're alone now
Can't help but feeling like I dropped the ball, cliché
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now, typically I kick game like East Bay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling: "Please play!"
For Pete's sake, homie, pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through with forever, but—

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya, yeah

[Chorus 2: J. Cole]
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are
All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)

[Chorus 1: J. Cole]
Got me up all night (All night)
All I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night (All night)
Constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night (All night)
Down-and-out with these love songs
She got me up all night (All night)
Drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
All I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
Constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
Down-and-out with these love songs
She got me open all night (Uh-huh)
Got me open all night, hey

[Outro: J. Cole]
Back when I was sleeping in my mama crib
*Space Bar Tap*

[Produced by J. Cole]

[Verse 1]
When I was seventeen
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for small town girls
And soft summer nights
We'd hide from the lights
On the village green
When I was seventeen

[Verse 2]
When I was twenty-one
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for city girls
Who lived up the stair
With all that perfumed hair
And it came undone
When I was twenty-one

[Verse 3]
When I was thirty-five
It was a very good year
It was a very good year for blue-blooded girls
Of independent means
We'd ride in limousines
Their chauffeurs would drive
When I was thirty-five

[Verse 4]
But now the days are short
I'm in the autumn of the year
And now I think of my life as vintage wine
From fine old kegs
From the brim to the dregs
It poured sweet and clear
It was a very good year

[Intro]
Shouts out to zone 6
East Atlanta stand up
Shouts out to the homey Coach-K

[Verse 1]
I’m in the ATL & I’m hot as hell with no AC
Got more green than AC, I spend 150 on my AP
I’m a asshole, kinda arrogant
An Aquarius, no Aries
Got a 1000 P’s of Asparagus
And it’s just touched from AZ
You fuck niggas don’t know me
Be accurate when you compare me
Got a AR & a AK & I’ll turn yo' ass to swiss cheese
Move smooth like a OG, give it to 'em when I go from A to B
Watching out for APD
Cause the spot been hot all goddamn week
Flashback, quantum leap
2003 and I’m in my V
Go back '99, puttin' Daytons on my Caprice
Fast forward, present time
Coming down the street in a Bentley
My pistol’s my assistant
I’ll shoot yo' ass from a distance

[Chorus]
Greasy, greasy
Don’t bring no knife to no gun fight because they greasy
Don’t buy no dope in East Atlanta cause that greasy
These niggas thirsty for that check, I swear they greasy
Young niggas greasy, OGs they greasy
West side, east side, north side, south side I swear they greasy
These niggas greasy, these bitches greasy
Young niggas thirsty for the check, I swear they greasy

[Verse 2]
Gucci Mane rock so much jewelry
That the niggas stand in and still feel worried
Better walk the yellow brick road
And ask the Wizard can you get some courage
Buy a brick and it don’t do shit
Don’t quit nigga, don’t get discouraged
Real speak, he keep talkin' shit
All of the niggas in yo clique get tortured
I’m a millionaire but I bought a Vic
Smoked it all with my bottom bitch
10 golds on my top grill, 10 golds on the bottom bitch
Actin' like you bougie
What you're Hillary Rodham bitch?
With them ol' last red bottoms
She blew a kiss, I didn’t acknowledge it
Think I need me a college chick
Good brain with that knowledge shit
Put her up on money
Switch out the bitch closet quick
Charger with a body kit
Cat suit her body bitch
Got free bricks, I got free weed
So you suck my dick you get benefits

[Chorus]
Greasy, greasy
Don’t bring no knife to no gun fight because they greasy
Don’t buy no dope in East Atlanta cause that greasy
These niggas thirsty for that check, I swear they greasy
Young niggas greasy, OGs they greasy
West side, east side, north side, south side I swear they greasy
These niggas greasy, these bitches greasy
Young niggas thirsty for the check, I swear they greasy

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
You know I work all day
To get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say
You're gonna give me everything
So why on earth should I moan
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
When I'm home, everything seems to be right
When I'm home feeling you holding me tight
Tight, yeah!

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
Ah!

[Guitar and Piano Solo: George Harrison and George Martin]

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
So why on earth should I moan
'Cause when I get you alone

When I'm home everything seems to be right
When I'm home feeling  you holding me tight
Tight, yeah!

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night

But when I get home to you

Will make me feel alright

[Outro: John Lennon]
You know I feel alright
You know I feel alright

I went from sleeping on the couch when I started
Grinding everyday I couldn't wait until I got my own apartment
Now I'm chillin in a house by the sand
Reach up in my pocket probably touch a couple grand
Growing up I was misunderstood, now this watch around my wrist got me feeling good
Went from Riverside now I'm out in Hollywood
And my buzz world wide like I knew it would
Momma I made it, your boys almost famous
Thanks for the support and I appreciate the patience
Hold up, here's a shout out to my favorites
23 years old and I'm aspiring to greatness

Yo, now I was downtown clubbin', ladies night
Seen shorty, she was crazy right
And I approach baby like: "Ma, what's your age and type?"
She looked at me and said, you's a baby, right
I told her I'm 18 and live a crazy life
Plus I'll tell you what the 80's like
And I know what ladies like
Need a man that's polite, listens and takes advice

[Verse 4: Asher Roth]
Hey ma, what's up, alright, I'm good
Come on we gone get it on tonight
I smoke, you drink, oh word, thats cool
Come on, cause we gone get high tonight

[Verse 5: King Chip]
Dropped so many jams I could do a best of
I get this money, keep the rhythm like quest love
Cleveland nigga under palm trees smoking good
You can't do nothing but respect it if you from the hood
My zip code 44108, click clack when you hear that 44 run away
I lost so many friends in my neighborhood
I know they love to see me down here doing good

[Hook: Mike Posner]
Started from the bottom now we here
Started from the bottom now the whole fucking crew is here
Started from the bottom now we here
Started from the bottom now we here
Started from the bottom now I'm here
Started from the bottom now the whole fucking crew is here
Started from the bottom now we here
Started from the bottom now we here

[Intro]
Swag, 2011
Young Nigga

[Verse 1]
Sick to my motherfucking tummy
Bitch must think I'm a motherfucking dummy
Because I dress bummy, bitch think I'm broke
Bitch, I ate one roach and I made a lot of money
Popping since Bastard, (manager) Clancy's my slave master
Thanks to them crackers, my pockets are fatter than excess shit that's weighing on Jasper
I've never popped a bottle, but I've fucked a couple models in Europe
Yup, and a couple of them swallowed
Meet me halfway, bitch I'm going all-in
And I never pull back, shout-out to my nigga Taco

[Hook]
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, (Golf Wang!)
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang

[Verse 2]
So, a couple fags threw a little hissfit
Came to Pitchfork with a couple Jada Pinkett signs
And said I was a racist homophobic
So I grabbed Lucas and filmed us kissing
Feelings getting caught, it's off, I'm pissing
You think I give a fuck? I ain't even stick my dick in yet (No homo, too soon)
And while y'all are rolling doobies
I be in my bedroom scoring movies
Still excited like a fucking newbie
Suck my dick, motherfucker, sue me
Mom got a new whip so she could scoop me
A year ago, I ain't have no hoopty
Four story home, gotta climb eight set of stairs
Just to see where my fucking roof be

[Hook]
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, (Golf Wang!)
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang

[Verse 3]
Wait a Goddamn second
I'm tripping balls, David Beckham
Would fall 'cause shit's going down
Just like Rodney King swimming lessons
Now me and Justin smoke sherm and been talking 'bout freeing perms
And purchasing weapons, naming them and aim 'em in One Direction
(wait a minute)
It sounds like midgets in a Goddamn speaker
Any time you play this shit loud
But that's just me trying to get milk now
And the grunts of the goddamn cow
Hit me on my beeper while Captain Hook suck my Peter
Pan camera, repeat procedure
And when the beat drop, have a goddamn seizure

[Hook]
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, (Golf Wang!)
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, (Golf Wang!)
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang
Fuck that, Golf Wang

[Verse 2]
Touch down in ya city where the pass at
Where the pass at? you make a nigga laugh black
Need a pass for you nigga, you'll get blast at
You just a mid-grade nigga like my last pack
I'm just a money makin' nigga you can call ASCAP
You waiting on me to fall you need to wait on your income tax check
I got so much money I left the mall with every damn bitch
And for the Panthers raise your arm up then you make a balled fist
They moved my nigga so far away cause they say he was high risk
His folks can't even come down to see him, barely can pay they damn rent
And now he frustrated, incarcerated and it got us all tense
And if them folks try to give me forty ima jump the damn fence

[Chorus]
I'm chargin $3900 for it I got them bags in
$850 you know I got that swag in
I got that mexican weed them bricks you know that trash shit
And all you gotta do is drive this shit to Athens
Bricks Squad in this bitch we known for takin'
I got a couple more 'dem squares they goin to Macon
I'ma stop by Savannah, then Augusta
And I'm a multimillionaire, but I'm from Custer

[Verse 2]
These niggas tryna hold me back
But a nigga can't never hold me back
Gucci Mane ima get up ima walk round and ima get me a stack
Walk around with these thigh pads
Damn my nigga that my bad
That you broke so damn fast
Had the same chance that I had
You feel bad but im not sad
You can talk trash but I moved on
Three homes, ten phones
Tell me where did it go wrong
All the money that I have
Aka that’s my stash
Nigga try to take my cash
Bet the nigga gon' die fast
50 bands in the brand new pants
Take $5000 and I wipe my ass
Gucci Mane fear no man
I’m a tough guy like Conan
Mojo my right hand
And R.I.P. to my dope man
I know he lookin down from Heaven

[Chorus]
I'm chargin $3900 for it I got them bags in
$850 you know I got that swag in
I got that mexican weed them bricks you know that trash shit
And all you gotta do is drive this shit to Athens
Bricks Squad in this bitch we known for takin'
I got a couple more 'dem squares they goin to Macon
I'ma stop by Savannah, then Augusta
And I'm a multimillionare, but I'm from Custer

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
It's Guwop
Four numbers

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Gucci Mane LaFlare, millionaire but don’t give no care
Tote my pistol anywhere, go to war with a grizzly bear (Huh)
Burn yo' house with yo' kids in there
Called the folks, I had mid in there
A-K & my Sig in there, drop top V12 cylinder (Go!)
Your girl never had Christian Louboutins so I bought her a pair
Really it’s not an affair 'cause she fucked a millionaire (Huh)

Extensions hanging out my britches
You can see this from a distance

Fresh-ass nigga with a dirty pistol
I’m the same nigga that fucked yo' sister
You so broke, can’t buy no pistol (Damn)
I’ll buy yo' bitch, I’ll buy yo' life
Don’t no one but yo mama miss ya (Wow)
Every day, I’m on drive nigga, never catch me in neutral
I ain’t doin' nothing in reverse
I wear Louie shoes, nigga, not Converse (Louie)
This concert is my convert
Got the right plan but the wrong person
I got yellow gold, I got rose gold
I got pink diamonds like Starburst (Brr!)
I don’t rehearse, I don’t plan first
I need a strong hook, I call the right person

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Yellowbone, butt naked
If the pussy wack, eject it
Man, all my hoes be actin' like detectives
But I don’t give a fuck and if I did, I would give it to you
That rainbow hair is two colors, rhythm and blues, yeah
I just sold Father Time a time zone
They say we runnin' out of time
Tell that to a time bomb, yeah
Then she kiss me on my bullet wound
Who are you?
'Cause motherfucker, I’m me, fuckin' right
And if she say she catching that nut, I throw a strike
I can’t believe it's butter, go get my butter knife
Shoot a nigga twice in case he live a double life
Lil Tunechi, yeah

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
Shawty pussy wet (Wet), the dope dripping wet (Wet)
I live a double life, I got a stupid dumb check (Dumb check)

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Yellowbone, butt naked
If the pussy wack, eject it
Man, all my hoes be actin' like detectives
But I don’t give a fuck and if I did, I would give it to you
That rainbow hair is two colors, rhythm and blues, yeah
I just sold Father Time a time zone
They say we runnin' out of time
Tell that to a time bomb, yeah

Who are you?
'Cause motherfucker, I’m me, fuckin' right
And if she say she catching that nut, I throw a strike
I can’t believe it's butter, go get my butter knife
Shoot a nigga twice in case he live a double life
Lil Tunechi, yeah

[Intro]
I wanna go back
I wanna go back to my home
I just wanna go back

[Verse 1]
I say, is this life, is this my time to waste?
I got all this money calling me, how the fuck I'ma turn it down?
And I done fucked around and bought too many cars now
Baby, I guess that I'm a superstar now
But I wish that I could go back
'Cause that money don't mean a thing when everybody changing

[Chorus]
Praying with they hands out
What the fuck you want from me?
I got all my niggas in here
So don't play with me, fuck a one-on-one
I don't wanna do it, wish I could go back to when I was young
Wish I could go back, go back, go back from where I came from
Yeah, and if I knew then what I knew now
I would change some

[Verse 2]
Crab niggas don’t know niggas, been here like a old nigga
When your girl see me she say, "Breezy you a cold nigga"
Motherfuck the club, tired of fake hoes and gold diggers
And why he tryna cuff your ass? Let go, nigga
In 1999, most of y’all didn't know me
Tryna call me brodi, nigga, you ain't my homie
I'm tryna cash out everybody I came up with
But these cameras steady on that fuck shit

[Chorus]
Praying with they hands out
What the fuck you want from me?
I got all my niggas in here
So don't play with me, fuck a one-on-one
I don't wanna do it, wish I could go back to when I was young
Wish I could go back, go back, go back from where I came from
Yeah, and if I knew then what I knew now
I would change some

[Bridge]
I just wanna go back to freedom
Just take away all the bullshit and rewind the truth
Now every day they want to say shit, that’s when I say, "Fuck you"
I'm no super fly no laces, I could give a fuck about you
These bitches hit me with that same old

[Chorus]
Praying with they hands out
What the fuck you want from me?
I got all my niggas in here
So don't play with me, fuck a one-on-one
I don't wanna do it, wish I could go back to when I was young (When I was, when I was)
Wish I could go back, go back, go back from where I came from (When I was, when I was)
Yeah and if I knew then what I knew now
I would change some (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
You could be my silver spring
Blue-green colors flashing
I would be your only dream
Your shining autumn ocean crashing

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't say that she's pretty
And did you say that she loved you?
Baby, I don't want to know

[Verse 2]
So I begin not to love you
Turn around, see me running
I say I loved you years ago
But tell myself you never loved me, no

[Pre-Chorus]
And don't say that she's pretty
And did you say that she loved you?
Baby, I don't want to know
Oh no, and can you tell me was it worth it?
Baby, I don't want to know

[Chorus]
Time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
Well, I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me

[Bridge]
I follow you down until the sound
Of my voice will haunt you
Give me just a chance
You'll never get away from the sound
Of the woman that loved you
Was I just a fool?
I follow you down until the sound
Of my voice will haunt you
Give me just a chance
You'll never get away from the sound
Of the woman that loved you

[Chorus]
Time cast a spell on you
But you won't forget me
I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me

[Verse]

[Ballout]
I'm ballin', No NBA
No I don't play in that game
Catch me in the fast lane
Grippin' grain, Smokin' stank
These bitches so damn lame
Since a nigga ballin' they said I change
I ain't done nothin' but stack my change
Now I'm buyin' chains, wearin' chains
I'm so up its a damn shame
Couple months ago me & my youngas' was doin our damn thang (300)
Hittin' thangs
Totin' thangs
Poppin' thangs
Reloading' thangs
We don't play games
Me & my partner, we'll blow his brains

[Hook]
(Ballout)
I'm ballin', No NBA
I ball harder than Bill Gates
I just seen a new bentley
I'm gonna get it, all grey
All these racks up in my pocket
That just make me go crazy
All these racks up in my pocket
That just make me go crazy

[Verse 2: Soulja Boy Tell'em]
50 racks in my pocket
I'm about to go dumb
Soulja Boy be ballin
On the court, like LeBron
I'm goin' in with Ballout
Your girl see me, she fall out
I made fif-ty-k today
So tonight I'm goin, all out
New Jordan's snatch that
Black cars, can't match that
Stunt with the money
Better use ya head up in the streets
I go hard up on the beat
I keep them Jordan's up on my feet
Nah, nigga don't want beef
Thumbin' thru that check
Word around town, we done went and bought a jet, flex (finesse)
I-I-I-I guess they figured out it ain't no stoppin'
We cashed out this shit, like a bank rappin'
And in my hood, man my block poppin'
Respect me like a boss, or its bodies droppin'
Gu-gu-gu-guap God, 80 racks stuffed in my robin's
Soulja Boy and Ballout they know we love money
Bum ass nigga, y'all ain't gettin' no money

[Hook]

[Part 1 | PartyIsntOver]

[Verse: Tyler The Creator]
Uhm, I said, the party isn't over
We could still dance, but I don't have no rhythm
So fuck it, take a chance with me
The party isn't over, we could still dance girl
But I don't have no rhythm
So fuck it, take a chance with a nigga
Like me, like me
Uhm, I said, the party isn't over
We could still dance, but I don't have no rhythm
So fuck it, take a chance with me
The party isn't over, we could still dance girl
But I don't have no rhythm
So fuck it, take a chance with a nigga
Like me, like me

[Part 2 | Campfire]

[Verse 1: Tyler The Creator]
Yeah, um
All I needed was a stick, grab the marshmallows
Motherfuckers getting lynched and burned
I earned it, my Flog Gnaw badge is looking good
On this brand new jacket
The donuts on the flag waving over the cabin
Now grab them graham crackers and pass them over here
Hurry, quickly I need a piece of Hersheys
Darker than the corners of the bushes we be lurking
I centered the mellow over the graham
Heated it too long now, it's melting over my hand
Fuck it, I'll bite it, I burnt it, but I liked it
Camping with my niggas, its so fucking exciting

[Interlude: Kids]
We're making s'mores by the campfire
Camp Flog Gnaw, Golf Wang summer

[Verse 2: Laetitia Sadier]
Sat by the fire
To witness gentle, but radical
Transformation ceased to be mindless
Create our own sweetness
At last growing the heart

[Interlude: Tyler, the Creator]
Yo bring the bass back in
Yeah, haha
Who ate all the fuckin' chocolate?
Oh that's Domo fat ass, haha
Yeah
I ain't trying to go home, really

[Part 3 | Bimmer]

[Hook: Tyler The Creator]
You remind me of my bimmer
A lot of trunk space, the perfect two seater
And you got a lot of drive, I’m trying to keep up
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
You remind me of my bimmer
See your ignition, baby girl I'm trying to key up
And your headlights are off, I'm trying to see 'em
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
So let me start it up and smash

[Verse 1: Tyler The Creator & (Frank Ocean)]
Pop some Tame Impala, your man got a lame Impala
(It'll get dark outside soon)
And I'm sharing Slurpees and you ain't even begin to swallow
You’re fucking nuts, green top we coupled up
Run my fingers through em as you wax and buff my muffler
Cause I fingered you, you think the fucking ring is coming up?
(Where the street lights trail, Oooooooo)
Maybe, I don’t know, I think you’re chill
(Ride for)
Riding on my pegs, and my back against your legs
And a seatbelt is needed if I get between 'em, yeah

[Hook: Tyler The Creator]
You remind me of my bimmer
A lot of trunk space, the perfect two seater
And you got a lot of drive, I’m trying to keep up
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
You remind me of my bimmer
See your ignition, baby girl I'm trying to key up
And your headlights are off, I'm trying to see 'em
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
So let me start it up and smash

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Mmmm it’ll get dark outside, soon (My baby, ride for me)
Where the street lights trail (My baby, ride for me)
You ain’t gotta lie to kick it darling
It’s cool we’re moving slow

[Bridge: Tyler The Creator]
You remind me of my bimmer
A lot of trunk space, the perfect two seater
You got a lot of drive I’m trying to keep up
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
You remind me of my bimmer, smash
You remind me of my bimmer

[Outro: Lionel]
Where you been, man?
Oh, I had a drop off to make real quick. Hey, have you seen Salem?
Oh she with that new dude, Wolf, or, Darnell, whatever his name is
Fuck that nigga, man. Hey you know where they went?
I seen 'em going down by the lake
What the fuck!
You good man? You need some sherm? I got some
I got a can of these baked beans too

[Spoken Intro]
The way she came into the place, I knew right then and there
There was something different about this girl
The way she moved her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion
As she stalked the room, I could feel the aura of her presence
Every head turned feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive, the girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

[Verse 1]
I never knew but I was walkin' the line (Hee!)
"Come go with me", I said, "I have no time" (Hee-hee!)
She said "Don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone" (Hee!)
My baby cried, she left me standin' alone (Hee! Hee!)

[Chorus]
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

[Spoken Interlude]
She came at me in sections with the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her web of sin
A touch, a kiss
A whisper of love, I was at the point of no return
Deep in the darkness of passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive, this girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

[Verse 2]
I never knew but I was livin' in vain (Hee!)
She called my house, she said "You know my name"
(You know my name!)
"And don't you pretend you never did me before"
(Don't you, don't you, baby!) (Hee!)
With tears in her eyes, my baby walked out the door
(Don't you, don't you, don't) (Hee! Hee! Hee! Hee!)

[Chorus]
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

[Alternate Chorus]
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!) (Dog gone!)
I have to pray to God, 'cause I know how lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul, but you're no damn lover friend of mine

[Ad-Libs]
Hee-hee!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Hoo!

[Bridge]
I cannot sleep alone at night
My baby left me here tonight
I cannot cope 'til it's all right
You and your manipulation, you hurt my baby

[Spoken Interlude]
And then it happened, she touched me
For the lips of a strange woman drop as a honeycomb
And her mouth was smoother than oil, but her inner spirit and words were as sharp as a two-edged sword
But I loved it, 'cause it's dangerous

[Chorus]
Dangerous (Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!) (Hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time (Oh!)
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me
Dangerous (Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!) (Hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time (Dog gone!) (Oh!)
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me
Dangerous (Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time (Woah!) (Oh, yeah!)
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me
Dangerous (Hee! Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Hoo-hee! Hoo!) (Dog gone!)
I have to pray to God, 'cause I know how lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul, but you're no damn lover friend of mine

[Outro: Ad-Libs]
Hoo!
Hoo!
Hoo!
My baby
You been, you take, uh
You don't, don't, don't
You turn, my baby
Hoo!
Hoo!
Hoo!
Hoo!
Hoo!
Hoo!
Dan'gerus
Dan'gerus, dan'gerus
Hoo!
Dan'gerus, dan'gerus
Hoo!

[Verse 1]
I was born legendary on the 12th of February
Big fat rich nigga, call me Refrigerator Perry
If I piss on your head then call it rain, do you believe it?
And your girl's a freak and I’ma leak it, I can’t keep a secret (Fuck It)
40 thou, chillin' out, under my PosturePedic mattress
Look at me now, iced out, damn I can fuck an actress
40 thou for a brick now and that's not even taxin
Turn my spot to a lean house, all I drink is Activis
And I ain’t even gotta flex to you bitch, I’m rich
Got the whole wide world shawty on my dick
Go tell your hot mouth ho she can suck my dick
I blow my nose with money ho, I’m snot nose rich
6’s on my chargers so I’m dodging potholes ho
Your nigga lost cuz he got on a Movado watch
And spill the sauce, bitch it ain’t a car that I ain’t got
Your nigga lost it but Gucci 'bout to lose his top
She found it sexy that every problem I got I address it
These niggas flexin', I pistol whip the boy that bring the message
Police interrogate me, man fuck the shit, am I arrested?
If not then let me go cuz bitch I got a show in Texas
Black nigga but I gotta stab like I’m Mexican
And I'mma hit your next of kin if I don’t have my Benjamins
Popped two mollies and it boosted my adrenaline
And your baby mama say my nuts taste like cinnamon

[Hook]
I pull up in a Bentley and I give they ass the business
Tractor trailer full of midget, nigga come and get it
Nigga you know all the cash I made on I-20
God can be my witness, I’m a real trap nigga
Pull up in the Bentley and I give they ass the business
I’m servin' by myself cuz I don’t need no co-defendant
Hand countin the money lost count at 560
Cartel wanna clip me cuz I intercept the shipment

[Verse 2]
I’ve been sellin' dope since a little boy, I ain’t have no choice
Two man operation but I ain’t have no voice
I ain’t have no Rolls Royce and I ain’t have no Porsche
But if you step on these Air Force Ones, then your ass gon' get jumped, son
Gotta Apologize to your granddaddy cuz I beat up your grandson
I’ve been jumpin out of that van boy, cuz I owe cash to the landlord
Say I whip the nigga with a pool stick, man Gucci Mane is no pool shark
All this diamonds sittin' on my chest baby, they turned me into a cold heart
You can jump in front of these bullets and act like you a Braveheart
Quick ticket to the graveyard, playin' hard but you fake heart
You with the won't bust a grape boys, mine kidnap and rape boys
Know the streets ain't safe boy, suggest you open that safe boy
You’ve been owing me since the 3rd nigga, and you don’t know it’s the 8 month
Like how your blood taste boy, cuz you lyin' to me in my face boy
Your dad say you’re a disgrace, mistake in the first place
Glock 40 on my waist, and I tote a pistol on the first date

[Hook]
I pull up in a Bentley and I give they ass the business
Tractor trailer full of midget, nigga come and get it
Nigga you know all the cash I made on I-20
God can be my witness, I’m a real trap nigga
Pull up in the Bentley and I give they ass the business
I’m servin' by myself cuz I don’t need no co-defendant
Hand countin the money lost count at 560
Cartel wanna clip me cuz I intercept the shipment

[Produced by Mike WiLL Made It]

[Verse 1]
Bitches say my diamonds be retarded
My little boy worth a mil in kindergarten
You in the VIP but ain't important
You say you want a bottle but can’t afford it
Growing up I ain’t have a lot of choices
My mama dropped me off on Moreland
She a vulture, it was better man, it was torture
If you married to a broke bitch my nigga divorce her
You don’t want these five hunnids
Then it ain’t and I can tell ya
If yo baby daddy broke then your child is a failure
Flash back to 99 now I got some shit to sell ya
Fast foward to 2009, Guwap got something to mail ya
I’m smoking gangsta kush, I’m on the toilet
They pulled us over but your girlfriend took the charges
Your boyfriend broke, can’t even buy a pair of Jordans
I’m ballin so hard I might buy a pair of Porsches

[Hook]
I’m a rich muthafucka
And she a thick muthafucka
Zone 6, muthafucka
And we some rich muthafuckas

[Verse 2]
Man I laughing to the bank again
Smoking dank no limit, it’s the tank again
Ice cream, Gucci Mane with the diamond grin
And if you really love me baby let me fuck your friend
I’m so turnt up that she tuned in
My penthouse so big she wanna move in
And my rims so big man it can’t fit
15 chains on, call me Slick Rick
Thick bitch, hill squarin' like a red nose
And these Forgis got me squattin' like a blue pitt
I got my main ho buyin more extendos
And shitin' on all my old foes, was my old goal
.44 bull frog, you a tadpole

[Hook]

[Verse 1 : Action Bronson]
Well you could, lick it, flip it, taste it if you wanna
I ain’t gonna chase you round and sweat the pussy like a sauna
Her skin shown a touch of cinnamon and chocolate cookie
Fuck it 8 times raw, I call it octopussy
White shores, a little moist right by the pussy line
Now it’s push, push, push, right in the tushy time
Smooth landing, that mean she got a baldy
She sucking pee pee, making bread just like Grimaldi
But I'm the hero, serving sausage like its San Gennaro
Forget your past and come with me because your man is zero
I’m the whole shit, vintage from the cellar
The floor is made of glass and not the slipper Cinderella
Yeah, let’s mind the beat don’t know to pass it twice with flying colors
Talking crazy on the text but now you're shy in covers
That don’t fly bitch, I thought you was a fly bitch
Turn that ass around and let me hit you with the heimlich

[Verse 2 : Hologram]
Mami can fuck me for free, or suck for a fee
Trust and you’ll see, it’s nothing to me
I need me a cutie, with a pachutie
I’m on duty, hitting the booty cause
My nigga Magic Johnson came through with a hummer
Jay fucking Steele left a rim shot like a drummer
And she was from cali so she said it’s a bummer
I gave a rim job to a nimrod, I’ve been hard
With a dumb bitch, in that 65 impala she had one switch
She had one wish, she said she wanna have my dick like a baby
No maybe, she like dark meat, white gravy
And we was uptown so I told her I’m wavy
And now I got a little message for a young lady
Wash your leather cheerio after you take a dumpington
Cause when we start to humpington
I’m going in your rumpington
One thing I won’t have twice is shit dick, say it

[Chorus]
In my mouth, in my mouth, in my mouth baby
In my mouth, in my mouth, in my mouth baby

[Verse 1: Soopafly]
See that fly skirt? That's my work
Lil' bad bitch, met her at the concert
With a crew of bitches, doin' their dance twerkin'
They bodies around, drop, make that ass work then
I moved in, like a cobra
Nigga shut it down, party over
You can ride this dick, I'm a chauffeur
I swing big bat, Sammy Sosa
You a hood rat, but I'm digging you
Fuck what you nigga do, only take a minute to
Suck on this motherfucker like you on a interview
Swag up, fresh from the top to the tennis shoes
Yea, look at my hoes
Pork chops and a bunch of Del Tacos
See my dick? That's the real drug
Beat the brakes off a bitch, Billy Club

I got a bad bitch (That's My Work)
Holdin' up traffic (That's My Work)
Catch her in the alley way (That's My Work)
Do whatever daddy say (That's My Work)

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
Pick your ass up and drop it back down
Turn around, hear me now
You pick her up, hit her off
She bring it back, to a real boss
My bitch, my ho, my bossette
Young white bitch, Farah Fawcett
Swag trippin' on her like a faucet
Just got off the pole, 'bout to give me what a boss get
Everything you give her on the flow, flow
With the same important gang, cold like the North Pole
Got a girl out of Jamaica, the paper moneymaker
Break you for everything that you got up in the bedroom
I got a bitch that you like, jeans fit right
I turnt her over night, she's an overnight dyke
She's an overnight sensation, asian persuasion
Put my dick up in her mouth, language changed into Haitian

That girl that you like (That's My Work)
I turnt her over night (That's My Work)
The one you think of (That's My Work)
Her friend fuck with G Dub (That's My Work)
That's my bitch (That's my work)

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
On the real cuz flip this, trip this
Nigga try to introduce me to my bitch
On the turf, I ain't drip saw the full dirt
Casanova, LaVert, revert
Back with another hit, better get another bitch
She's so playful, that bitch ain't faithful
Cus' I can name five different times
When the bitch went for hers, so I'm gonna get mine
I got four 'lacs, 5 Chevrolets, what it do
Even got a bulletproof, I'm tied in with the upper echelon
When you with me bitch, you get what you want
And you can bring a friend too, comment allez-vous
Little French dip for a bitch like you
Sucker punch, I don't think so
Well what do you know? When I pulled up, a little yellow bitch stood up
I threw the hood up
You know why?

That little bitch you like (That's My Work)
You know, that little shit you like (That's My Work)
Oh yea, you know I get you right (That's My Work)
Late night, I come and hit you right (That's My Work)

[Verse 4: Daz Dillinger]
That's my work!
Oh yea she naughty naughty, she a fuck good
She wanna party party hands in the air
And yea she don't stop, that’s my work
24/7 she don't stop
Hold your head back, well come on and take a shot
Cus' I'm here down until the last drop
Because you know that I know that I got work
She a bad bitch from her smirk to her skirt
In a bra T-shirt, she a born workaholic
It's so many bitches that a nigga can call it
From my iPhone to a Android
Hey yo that's my bitch
Oh yea, she employed?

Dance, dance, dance

[Verse 1]
I saw a spider, I didn't scream
'Cause I can belch the alphabet
Just double dog dare me
And I chose guitar over ballet
And I tape these suckers down
'Cause they just get in my way

[Pre-Chorus]
(The way) The way (You look) you look at me
Is kinda like a little sister
(High five) You high five (You) your goodbyes
And it leaves me nothing but blisters

[Chorus]
So I don't wanna be (Don't wanna be)
One of the boys (Don't wanna be)
One of your guys (Don't wanna be)
Just gimme a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be (Just wanna be)
One of the girls (Just wanna be)
Pretty in pearls (Just wanna be)
Not one of the boys

[Verse 2]
So over the summer, something changed
I started reading Seventeen and
Shaving my legs and
I studied Lolita religiously
And I walked right into school and caught you
Staring at me 'cause

[Pre-Chorus]
(I know) I know (What you) what you know
But now you're gonna have to take a number
(Okay) It's okay, (Maybe) maybe one day
But not until you gimme my diamond ring

[Chorus]
'Cause I don’t wanna be (Don't wanna be)
One of the boys (Don't wanna be)
One of your guys (Don't wanna be)
Just gimme a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be your (Just wanna be)
Homecoming queen (Just wanna be)
Pinup poster dream (Just wanna be)
Not one of the boys

[Bridge]
I wanna be a flower
Not a dirty weed
I wanna smell like roses
Not a baseball team
And I swear maybe one day, you're gonna wanna
Make out, make out, make out with me
Don't wanna be (Don't wanna be)
Don't wanna be (Don't wanna be)
Don't wanna... (Don't wanna be)

[Chorus]
So I don't wanna be (Don't wanna be)
One of the boys (Don't wanna be)
One of your guys (Don't wanna be)
Just gimme a chance to prove to you tonight
That I just wanna be (Just wanna be)
One of the girls (Just wanna be)
Pretty in pearls (Just wanna be)
Not one of the boys

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Real shit, I said
The name of the game
Get the change fuck the fame
If it ain't about no money, I ain't fucking with you gains
When I was cuffed in the chains
Niggas ain't give me a holla
Bail ninety five hundred, niggas ain't give me a dollar
That's the number one problem
No respect, no loyalty
Business over bitches, that's number one and most importantly
Today I fell, I know ya would be the ones that supporting me
I call the phone, ya hitting buttons avoiding me
I was in my cell boiling, like when I touchdown
I'mma kill something
That's when I caught myself, like nigga get a deal or something
Eat a mill or something, getting rich will make em sick
The main ones I thought that was real, they was fake as shit
Talking bout they never change
I needed help, they never came
Same time you making money off my name
Know whats fucked up in the game
Cause God just had to show me
Who to keep close to me and on the real you niggas owe me
Shit my mom was the one that told me
Man them niggas ain't gon' ride, when you down doing your time
They acting out here like you died
So I'm laughing with a smile
Man the game switching lanes, and I ain't dissing on you niggas, nah
I'm just spitting pain
This is real shit, flowing like the blood that's in my veins
Homie feel this cause it can happen to your boy the same
I'm the only boy to blame
Cause I was down for you niggas
I would ride, I would die, bust my pound for you niggas like
I was on cortine, living like a poor fiend
Niggas taking meds, just to kill the pain like its morphine
Yea, go ahead sleep on me
You boys dream, and I be at it chasing cabbage, serving more cream
I had to separate myself from the lames
Had to realize that me and niggas ain't the same, can't complain
I kept it a hundred, sunny or rain
Through the fame or the pain, regardless I would remain the same
But like EA sports I'm in the game
But my homies looking like four quarters the way they change
Shit, could it be the money or could it be the horse
Man I don't even know, it could be either or
Niggas get nice like Mike and try to leave they Bulls
For the love of the green, turn around and change they team
For this money dawg, I done seen some crazy things
But I'm still in good condition like maybelline
That's why I'm trynna bubble like shampoo
But on the low though, I'm on my solo like zandu

[George Harrison Cover]

[Verse 1]
I can see the turning of the key
I’ve been deceived by the clown inside of me
I thought that he was righteous but he’s vain
Oh, something’s a-telling me I wear the ball and chain

[Verse 2]
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost
He’s always off somewhere when I need him most
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill
But my heart is a-tellin’ me I love ya still

[Verse 3]
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
I see you in the streets, I begin to swoon
I love to see you dress before the mirror
Won’t you let me in your room one time ’fore I finally disappear?

[Verse 4]
Everybody’s wearing a disguise
To hide what they’ve got left behind their eyes
But me, I can’t cover what I am
Wherever the children go I’ll follow them

[Verse 5]
I march in the parade of liberty
But as long as I love you I’m not free
How long must I suffer such abuse
Won’t you let me see you smile one time before I turn you loose?

[Verse 6]
I’ve given up the game, I’ve got to leave
The pot of gold is only make-believe
The treasure can’t be found by men who search
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church

[Verse 7]
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed
I asked ya please to cross me off-a your list
My head tells me it’s time to make a change
But my heart is telling me I love ya but you’re strange

[Verse 8]
One more time at midnight, near the wall
Take off your heavy makeup and your shawl
Won’t you descend from the throne, from where you sit?
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it
Please don't wake me up too late
Tomorrow comes and I will not be late
Late today when it becomes
Tomorrow I
Will leave and go away

Goodbye. Goodbye
Goodbye. Goodbye
Goodbye. Goodbye
My love, goodbye

Songs that linger on my lips
Excite me now and linger on my mind
Leave your flowers at my door;
I leave them for
The one who waits behind

Goodbye. Goodbye
Goodbye. Goodbye
Goodbye. Goodbye
My love, goodbye
(ad lib)

Goodbye. Goodbye
Goodbye. Goodbye
Goodbye. Goodbye
My love, goodbye

Far away my lover sings
A lonely song and calls me to his side
Where the sound of lonely drums
Invited me on
I must be by his side

Goodbye. Goodbye
Goodbye. Goodbye
Goodbye. Goodbye
My love, goodbye

Goodbye
Ah, ha, ha, hi
Goodbye

[Verse 1]
Early one morning the sun was shining
I was laying in bed
Wondering if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red
Her folks they said our lives together
Sure was going to be rough
They never did like Mama's homemade dress
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
And I was standing on the side of the road
Rain falling on my shoes
Heading out for the East Coast
Lord knows I've paid some dues
Getting through
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 2]
She was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam, I guess
But I used a little too much force
We drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out West
Split up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best
She turned around to look at me
As I was walking away
I heard her say over my shoulder
"We'll meet again someday
On the avenue"
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 3]
I had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all that much
And one day the ax just fell
So I drifted down to New Orleans
Where I lucky was to be employed
Working for a while on a fishing boat
Right outside of Delacroix
But all the while I was alone
The past was close behind
I seen a lot of women
But she never escaped my mind
And I just grew
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 4]
She was working in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer
I just kept looking at the side of her face
In the spotlight, so clear
And later on, when the crowd thinned out
I was just about to do the same
She was standing there, in back of my chair
Said, "Tell me, don't I know your name?"
I muttered something underneath my breath
She studied the lines on my face
I must admit, I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces
Of my shoe
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 5]
She lit a burner on the stove
And offered me a pipe
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said
"You look like the silent type"
Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century
And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like burning coal
Pouring off of every page
Like it was written in my soul
From me to you
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 6]
I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs
There was music in the cafes at night
And revolution in the air
Then he started into dealing with slaves
And something inside of him died
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside
And when it finally, the bottom fell out
I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keeping on
Like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 7]
So now I'm going back again
I got to get to her somehow
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now
Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenter's wives
Don't know how it all got started
I don't know what they're doing with their lives
But me, I'm still on the road
A-heading for another joint
We always did feel the same
We just saw it from a different point
Of view
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 1]
Fly me to the moon
Let me play among the stars
And let me see what spring is like
On a-Jupiter and Mars
In other words, hold my hand
In other words, baby, kiss me

[Verse 2]
Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Fill my heart with song
Let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, in other words
I love you

[Intro]
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?

[Verse 1]
Ooh, each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
Take a look at yourself in the mirror and cry
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord, what you're doin' to me? (Yeah, yeah)
I have spent all my years in believin' you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord

I work hard (He works hard) every day of my life
I work 'til I ache my bones
At the end (At the end of the day) I take home
My hard-earned pay all on my own
(Goes home, goes home on his own)
I get down (Down) on my knees (Knees) and I start to pray (Praise the Lord)
'Til the tears run down from my eyes, Lord

[Chorus]
Somebody (Somebody)
Ooh, somebody (Please)
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?

No, no, no, no

I ain't gonna face no defeat (Yeah, yeah)
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
(One day) Someday I'm gonna be free, Lord

[Verse 1]
I like to see you boogie
Right across the floor
I like to do it to you
'Til you holler for more
I like to reggae
But you dance too fast for me
I'd like to make love to you
So you can make me scream

[Chorus]
So boogie on reggae woman
What is wrong with me?
Boogie on reggae woman
Baby, can't you see?

[Verse 2]
I'd like to see both of us
Fall deeply in love

Let me do it to you
Boogie on reggae woman
What you tryin' to do?

[Outro: Harmonica solo]

[Verse 1]
Just before our love got lost you said
"I am as constant as a northern star"
And I said, "Constantly in the darkness
Where's that at?
If you want me I'll be in the bar"

[Verse 2]
On the back of a cartoon coaster
In the blue TV screen light
I drew a map of Canada
Oh, Canada
With your face sketched on it twice

[Chorus]
Oh, you are in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling
And I would still be on my feet
Oh, I would still be on my feet

[Verse 3]
Oh, I am a lonely painter
I live in a box of paints
I'm frightened by the devil
And I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid

[Verse 4]
I remember that time you told me, you said
"Love is touching souls"
Surely you touched mine
'Cause part of you pours out of me
In these lines from time to time

[Chorus]
Oh, you are in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling
Still I'd be on my feet
I would still be on my feet

[Verse 5]
I met a woman, she had a mouth like yours
She knew your life
She knew your devils and your deeds
And she said, "Go to him, stay with him if you can
But be prepared to bleed"

[Chorus]
Oh, but you are in my blood, you are my holy wine
You're so bitter, bitter and so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling
Still I'd be on my feet
I would still be on my feet

[Skit: Paul Rosenberg]
Em, it's Paul, listen. Joel just called me and he told me you're in the fucking back behind his studio, shooting your gun off in the air like it's a shooting range. I told you not to fucking bring your gun around like an idiot, outside of your home, you're gonna get yourself in trouble. Don't bring your gun outside of your home, you can't carry it on you. Leave your fuckin' gun at home!

[Verse 1: Jimi Hendrix]
Well, I see hands, and I see tear-stained faces
Reaching up but not quite touching the promised land
Well, I taste tears and the precious years wasted
Saying Lord, please, send us a helping hand

[Chorus: Jimi Hendrix, (Background Singers)]
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
On the mountain stands a woman
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Hey, I feel her shining light
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Lord, must be the answer
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Thank you, Lord, and keep her alright
Got them earth blues today

[Verse 2: Jimi Hendrix]
I hear the thunder of freedom's beating heart
Sirens clashing with black earth and rocking stone
I think you better love me now, darling, it just might be too late after a while
And tell our child to bury old daddy's broken clothes

[Chorus: Jimi Hendrix, (Background Singers)]
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Hey, I see a beautiful woman
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Yes, and I feel her shining light on me
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Lord! Must be the answer
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Help me, Lord, and keep her alright for me

[Bridge: Jimi Hendrix, (Background Singers)]
(Help me, darling)
Help me, darling
(Help me, darling)
To keep the light
(Help me, darling)
Everything alright
(Help me, darling)
Keep shining bright
(Help me, darling)
Help me darling
(Help me, darling)
Help me darling
(Help me, darling)
Ooh!
(Help me, darling)
Got those earth blues today
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Oooh!
(Lord, Lord, Lord)

[Verse 3: Jimi Hendrix]
Yeah but, uh, sometimes my imagination grabs me by surprise
A queen of ebony in chains I visualize
And back on the moon, I see her portrait in a tomb
And these words are written, first woman from God's womb

[Chorus: Jimi Hendrix, (Background Singers)]
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Hey! Stands a woman
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
And I feel her shining light
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Lord, must be the answer
(Lord, Lord, Lord)
Thank you, Lord, and keep her alright
Yeah!
I think I'll be alright with my baby now
Shake these earth blues away from me, baby

[Hook: Tyga]
I'mSuper Dupa Fly

[Verse 1]
There’s colors on the street
Red, white, and blue
People shuffling their feet
People sleeping in their shoes
There’s a warning sign on the road ahead
There’s a lot of people saying we’d be better off dead
Don’t feel like Satan, but I am to them
So I try to forget it any way I can

[Chorus]
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world

[Verse 2]
I see a woman in the night
With a baby in her hand
There's an old street light
Near a garbage can
Now she put the kid away and she’s gone to get a hit
She hates her life and what she’s done to it
There’s one more kid that’ll never go to school
Never get to fall in love, never get to be cool

[Chorus]
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world

[Electric Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
We got a thousand points of light
For the homeless man
We got a kinder, gentler machine gun hand
We've got department stores and toilet paper
Got styrofoam boxes for the ozone layer
Got a man of the people says keep hope alive
Got fuel to burn, got roads to drive

[Chorus]
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world

[Electric Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Keep on rockin' in the free world

[Verse 1]
I feel unhappy, I feel so sad
I've lost the best friend that I ever had
She was my woman, I loved her so
But it's too late now, I've let her go

[Chorus]
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

[Verse 2]
We shared the years, we shared each day
In love, together, we found the way
But soon, the world had its evil way
My heart was blinded, love went astray

[Chorus]
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

[Verse 3]
It took so long to realise
And I can still hear her last goodbyes
Now, all my days are filled with tears
Wish I could go back and change these years

[Chorus]
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Break dancin', break dancin', break dance
Break dancin', break dancin', break dance
Break a nine piece off a brick and make it break dance
Choppa got you spinnin’ on your head like you break dancin’
My pistol in the club with me, I don't wanna break dance
This MAC-11 gon' make a nigga strip, like a shake down

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
My favorite weapon MAC-11, black and red patent leather lavish
Was so broke in '97, prayed a brick would come from heaven
Niggas used to laugh when I walk from Boulder Crest to Gresham
So who’s laughing last, I just pulled up in a 911
Money don’t make me, clothes don’t make me
Lot of people still ain't heard of me
They used to just know me locally, now they know me globally
Atlanta Overlook apartments, just came back from overseas
If I can do it, you can do it, you started with more than me
Mom couldn't really do much for me
So broke used to eat lunch for free
Backstabbed so many people that my boysL won’t even pass the blunt to me
Lord I hope that he forgive me, but fuck that nigga that’s history
Yeah fuck nigga I stole your bombL, hope that ends your mystery
And if it's all about the timing, my time piece cost 80 g's
Hit a lick for 80 P's, boy just go ask 

[?]

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Break dancin', break dancin', break dance
Break dancin', break dancin', break dance
Break a nine piece off a brick and make it break dance
ChoppaL got you spinnin’ on your head like you break dancin’
My pistol in the club with me, I don't wanna break dance
This MAC-11 gon' make a nigga strip, like a shake down

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
1017 for them bands, we gon' hunt ya bae
Got a rifle with my dog like a hunter bae
Red bottom add the spikes, I’m a punter!
She wanna suck all of these Snickers, she got hunger
500 horses on my motherfucking tires
I'll splat his ass up put that on fiver
Everybody with me eating, we got fiber
In the kitchen, wrapping, wrapping like a cypher
Told you one too many times, we got dimes, it’s my prime time
Ridin' with king slime, that’s my slime
K spank yo behind, we gon' drop a dime, I'm not lyin'
You's a Busta like Rhymes, never committed a crime or did no time

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Break dancin', break dancin', break dance
Break dancin', break dancin', break dance
Break a nine piece off a brick and make it break dance
Chopper got you spinnin’ on your head like you break dancin’
My pistol in the club with me, I don't wanna break dance
This MAC-11 gon' make a nigga strip, like a shake down

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
It's iced out shawty
Your bitch wanna fuck with me, I don't doubt it
Gucci Mane show man, the club so crowded
Got a mean watch on me, cost a cool 140
I'm the center of attention, watch these hoes stand round me
I took a picture with your bitch, I don't know why you allowed it
We check the strong pack in, yeah my kush is the loudest
And my name ring bells, different countries and counties
They had a bounty on my chain, how the fuck they found it
I blow so much purp that I can't stay grounded
6's on my skraight 8 Jeep, yea it's mounted
A nigga say he jack me, how the fuck that sounded?

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
200 cash, that's on the floor
I got 100 bands going out the door
Bitch kiss my ass, fuck them foes
I'm hustling hard baby, gotta get the doe
200 cash, layin' on the floor
I got 100 bands going out the door
Kiss my ass, bitch fuck them foes
I'm hustling hard bitch, I gotta get the doe

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I'm hustling hard, bitch I gotta get the doe
I'm Coca Cola sellin' soda, whippin' it in the bowl
I'm flippin', I'm flippin', I'm flippin', I'm flippin', I'm shittin' like on the commode
I'm sackin', I'm freezin', I'm flippin' that Cola, you niggas be sellin' your soul
This here shit is gettin' crazy, niggas are gettin' bold
These niggas will tell on they mama. It hit the fan, they act like hoes
I'm goin' my loop with steel-toed boots, so niggas can't step on my toes
I'm cockin' my pistol and smoking these swishers, I'm bout to lose control
I'm workin that show like I'm flippin that dope, my pockets are super swole
Ride through the trap and I got that scrap, don't know who's friend or foe
These niggas'll blow your head, I'll just pour a ounce of blow
And since you ran off with a brick then watch this stick blow off your nose

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
200 cash, that's on the floor
I got 100 bands going out the door
Bitch kiss my ass, fuck them foes
I'm hustling hard baby, gotta get the doe
200 cash, layin' on the floor
I got 100 bands going out the door
Kiss my ass, bitch fuck them foes
I'm hustling hard bitch, I gotta get the doe

[Verse 3: Rocko]
Soon as I enter, pussy niggas exit
Ball like the arena, go home with all that flexin'
Real street niggas in your area, we ain’t goin' for it, we dare ya
F'in Glock carrier, we gon' bury ya
All the bitches hysterical, they know how I kick it
Sat watchin' ass nigga, you ain't come to spend it, why the fuck you here
Poor hustlin' ass nigga, 100 bands in my ear
On the left and right pocket, 50 bands in my rear
Born champion, gladiator, conquered all my fields
Been alive for 30 years, I been getting money for 20 year
I’m with Gucci, that my brother from another mother
Brothers of the same struggle, still in the trap house, we so gutter

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
200 cash, that's on the floor
I got 100 bands going out the door
Bitch kiss my ass, fuck them foes
I'm hustling hard baby, gotta get the doe
200 cash, layin' on the floor
I got 100 bands going out the door
Kiss my ass, bitch fuck them foes
I'm hustling hard bitch, I gotta get the doe

[Verse 1]
It’s the East Atlanta summer so y'all don’t trip
I can wrap a brick up like a Christmas gift
Me and that white girl got a relationship
I got 50 mil zanny, you can take this piff
I know you see me over there with the black four fifth
And every year I’m at least good for 4, 5 mil
Can’t buy no drink from me, you ain’t got no seal
Can’t drink no pints with you cuz you pour unreal
You pour the lean so light you gotta take 4 pills
I pour the lean so dark they still sleep still
I’m not Boosie not Webbie but I’m too damn trill
R.I.P. to Lil Phat and my homeboy Slim
I made a million dollars on the same street my boy got killed
Shotgun'll make you say Big Sean ad libs
I spent 35k, man I just left Fifth's
You want stop a duck from quackin' then cut off his bill

[Chorus]
Man I’m still trappin' hard like I’m supposed to
Still chargin' bitches like I’m supposed to
You niggas still snitchin' like y'all supposed to
You niggas still hatin' like y'all supposed to
Trap house rollin' like I’m supposed to
Still gettin' money like I’m supposed to
You niggas still hatin' like y'all supposed to
You bitches still wait like y'all supposed to
I’m still chargin' bitches like I’m supposed to
I’m still testin' niggas like I’m supposed to
You niggas keep watchin' me like y'all supposed to
Keep on blockin' me like y'all supposed to

[Verse 3]
Well it was told to you and it was told to me
Got a bad rich bitch whippin' post to me
And I can’t marry her cuz money married to me
And if I die right now my son inherit the cheese
Got money in my pocket like I’m supposed to
My jeans saggin' low like I’m supposed to
Your girl chose me, man damn it’s over
You keep on textin' her, you want some closure
Big Guwap, I run you over
Your bitch so fine, she’s a hell of a soldier
I thought she chose up cuz I’m extra froze up
I got so much guap, I can stick my nose up

[Chorus]
Man I’m still trappin' hard like I’m supposed to
Still chargin' bitches like I’m supposed to
You niggas still snitchin' like y'all supposed to
You niggas still hatin' like y'all supposed to
Trap house rollin' like I’m supposed to
Still gettin' money like I’m supposed to
You niggas still hatin' like y'all supposed to
You bitches still wait like y'all supposed to
I’m still chargin' bitches like I’m supposed to
I’m still testin' niggas like I’m supposed to
You niggas keep watchin' me like y'all supposed to
Keep on blockin' me like y'all supposed to

[Verse 1: Dyme-A-Duzin]
My hands on you, you got a man, that's cool
'Cause we here (And he's not, he's not, he wouldn't want you to be lonely)
I got some plans for you, if your down
Then let me know right now, let me know right now
The universe has chosen where we're led
So my way with with words didn't get you in my bed
Some things in life are better left unsaid
So close your eyes (Eyes), open wide
Pop that thought bubble and bring it to life

[Chorus: Dyme-A-Duzin]
Does he really? Does he really? Does he really?
Does he really? Does he really? Does he really?
Does he really? Does he really? Does he really
Mean as much as you made him seem?

[Verse 2: Dyme-A-Duzin]
Lips, hands, connected by an excuse
But who knew you wanted it too
Now you're right in front of me, boo
Been stuck in reality for a long time
Would you save me, baby?
We've gone too far, but I'm as wrong as you are
But "one day" just happened to be today
Put down your guard and see it's not that hard to be
Bad, does he really?

[Chorus: Dyme-A-Duzin]
Does he really? Does he really? Does he really?
Does he really? Does he really? Does he really?
Does he really? Does he really? Does he really
Mean as much as you made him seem?
Does he really? Does he really? Does he really?
Does he really? Does he really? Does he really?
Does he really? Does he really? Does he really
Mean as much as you made him seem?

[Outro: Dyme-A-Duzin]
Lips, hands, connected by an excuse

[Verse 1 - Gucci Mane]
6's on the Charger and they said it couldn't fit
But I'mma still do it cause a nigga so hood
Wish I could and I know I should
But fuck that shit, right now I can't do it
Got a super thick chick with some real big lips
And a swear the little bitch suck the dick so good
Gonna hit this scrilla like a picnic
Take a clip, bitch, take a Twitpic, ? of a big dick
Talkin' too slick, too quick, to a new bitch
Bitch'll teach a trick to a trick, have a blue dick
'Bout the same time that Jay dropped the Blueprint
Nigga tried to say that I hit him with a pool stick
Say you got a gun, but you know you can't use it
So Icey boys, and we still tote Uzis
It's about money, it ain't never 'bout music
Yeah, he from the streets, but he still ain't Gucci
Hunnid bottles of champagne, just cooln
If groupies keep droolin', then the hoes keep choosin'
Walkin' through the mall like I'm 7 feet tall
Tryin' on shoes and I got my toolie(?)
Damn Gucci Mane, you so unruly
If I'm standing in ya way, then pussy nigga, come move me
10-17, yeah that's my movement
Got 10 young killers on the back of my ?

[Hook]
My cup so dirty
My cup so muddy

[Bridge]
Dirty cup, dirty cup
Damn I got a muddy cup

[Verse 2 - 2 Chainz]
Opposite of being broke, mane
Cocaine, dope man, got them Js smokin' out a coke can
Nigga got so much work, talkin' work
When I'm in the car, they still say I'm ridin' in the work van
Oh man, oh man, you don't really know
What it did when the spot you workin' at is really hot
And you gotta put it in the butt, but her butt ain't big enough
So you gotta go get a booty shot
Got my tooly cocked, let the 50 cal dig her down
Niggas know I pay a few bills
Your work stepped on, I got my vest on
Mufuckas already knowing what it really is
Click clack, get back
You work out, might hit him for a six pack
Work out
Get that? Might hit him for a six pack
Flip that, me and broke nigga mismatch
My rims cost 10 stacks
Pimp that, get back
If I fall off, then I motherfuckin' limp back
Pimp that, pimp what
She said where your motherfuckin' limp at
I said I had a good year baby
So where my, my motherfuckin' blimp at

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3 - Gucci Mane]
Back against the wall, I'mma ball like a dog
I don't fuck with y'all, y'all won't ever be me
Talk sweet game to a petite thing in the Jeep mane
Knock ya teeth out in the middle of the heat game
You see things, hoes see things, you a G, mane
Be all you can be, don't be like me, mane
Give you 'bout three, I'mma whoop it like free
Have a pint, have a liter, this that dirty sweet tea
By three, I was just tryin' to grind on a G, mane
Same time that Dr. Dre said "G Thang"
Damn what another nigga said 'bout me
Why these niggas still worry 'bout me
Buyin' ?? mane on the D-train when the bricks came
Damn I act a fool in the kitchen with my wrist game
Ice on my neck, got a chick and a Vette
And I'm ballin' like a player for the motherfuckin' Jets, mane
Take it to the streets, want a war with a G
Live at the gun range like my name Chief Keef
Say he got beef but you ridin' two deep
I'll knock a passenger to the damn backseat
King Louis shoes on my feet, ain't cheap
Gucci Mane street, I'm so concrete
Me and Zay's style is so unique
Got your baby brother sellin' work for me

[Chorus: 2 Chainz, Drake & A$AP Rocky]
I love bad bitches, that's my fucking problem like sucking on my dick
And yeah I like to fuck, I got a fucking problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fucking problem
And yeah I like to fuck I got a fucking problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fucking problem
And yeah I like to fuck, I got a fucking problem
If finding somebody real is your fucking problem
Bring your girls to the crib maybe we can solve it

[Verse: Trey Songz]
I love bad bitches, I'm such a savage it's ridiculous
Show me a bad bitch and I'll give her a dick to kiss
Tell her tongue it down, throat emphasis
Give me brain 'til her brain can't remember shit
I make it summer rain though she got December dick
Let her states remain and I leave my name in it
I mean I put my name on it
Got a picture perfect pussy, I'mma put a frame on it
I keep it so a hundred but positions change on it
She told me how she want it, her face I came on it
I'm never disappointed, I left her disjointed
Pancakes and eggs with some head in the morning
They say money make a nigga act nigga-ish
White hoes love nigga dick
Don't know why I always got another nigga's bitch
But I bet I'll always put it in her ribs, I beast

[Chorus: 2 Chainz, Drake & A$AP Rocky]
I love bad bitches, that's my fucking problem like sucking on my dick
And yeah I like to fuck, I got a fucking problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fucking problem
And yeah I like to fuck I got a fucking problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fucking problem
And yeah I like to fuck, I got a fucking problem
If finding somebody real is your fucking problem
Bring your girls to the crib maybe we can solve it

[Verse 1]
I could sprinkle you with game, but you just too fuckin' lame
I can put you up on something, but you still wouldn’t learn nothing
You know the game is to be sold mane, and not for you lames mane
I spent half of my life nigga sellin' crack cocaine
I’m a victim of the dope game, I don’t like to name names
I don’t like to name drop, I just like cocaine drops
All I do is drop tops, man I’m so god damn hot
If you got a old car, then go get a new one
If you don’t got no strap, go and get you two guns
Got a bitch so fine with me, she make me want 2 sons
I told her baby call me Mr. Never Ever Use A Coupon
Baby got that slow dome, my trap like a group home
I’m bad with niggas, but I’m good with bitches
Man Gucci Mane, so superstitious
Rag to riches, no pot to piss in
Three years goin' I ain’t seen no Christmas
Six months goin' I ain’t seein' no drought
Work so good they don’t ever get slow
Burglar bar doors on all my houses
I’mma put hardwood on all of my floors

[Hook]
Dog a bitch, drag a bitch, so bad I need a damn collar
Pimp nigga, ain’t turnin' shit down but my damn collar
Police pointin' at me, tryna snag me by my damn collar
Gucci Mane ain’t never graduate but I’m a trap scholar
Dog a bitch, drag a bitch so bad I need a damn collar
Pimp nigga, I ain't turnin' down shit but my damn collar
Police man be chasin', wanna grab me by my damn collar
Gucci Mane didn’t graduate, but guess what, I'm a trap scholar

[Verse 2]
Hit the club I'm clean as hell, but yeah I got them dirty dollars
Drag a bitch so bad I need a god damn dog collar
Pull up in three Phantoms like I’m Creflo damn Dollar
And if your bitch with me, no need to call, don’t even bother
Limpin', screamin', pimpin', turn my trap to a damn brothel
Deep dishs pizzas on my chargers, tryna dodge every pothole
You ain’t gotta worry bout your bitch cuz your boy got her
Said she want some dick, then guess what she gon' get a whole lot of
Knock her, then I think I need a god damn El Dorado
Big face Rollie, keep it rolling, for I leave you holy moly
I’m golden, call me goldie
Can’t none of these fuck niggas hold me
I’m a young nigga but I OG
Y'all bout to turn me to the old me
And no OC, I could OD cuz I drink so much damn codeine
I’m solo, no Co-De
And this Mac 11 is my homie's
I'm up ain't talkin' bout mollies
I'm up ain't talkin' bout coffee
Don’t give a damn about you nigga and don’t give a damn about them police

[Hook]
Dog a bitch, drag a bitch, so bad I need a damn collar
Pimp nigga, ain’t turnin' shit down but my damn collar
Police pointin' at me, tryna snag me by my damn collar
Gucci Mane ain’t never graduate but I’m a trap scholar
Dog a bitch, drag a bitch so bad I need a damn collar
Pimp nigga, I ain't turnin' down shit but my damn collar
Police man be chasin', wanna grab me by my damn collar
Gucci Mane didn't graduate, but guess what, I'm a trap scholar

[Verse 1]
Brick Squad about to walk in here
So cold I make bitch say BURR
Drinkin' on lean like a ice cold beer
Can't give you none, give you what got you here
Diamonds so big they hurt my ear
Sip codeine bitch, not Belvedere
Ballin' like a nigga on his first day out
You chain so little that it hurt my eye
Your watch ain't real, you a goddamn lie
Got some little bitty niggas, I'm a big ol' playa
I can take her to you vacation
Car collection, first placed it
Offered 10 years and he couldn't take it
Told on the whole damn operation
I'm a man bruh, so I'mma stand for
Everything I stand for
And I'm a hound dog, kinda fragile
Cause I drop down, better pipe down
EA, GA, AK to the peach state
And a bitch can't call me cheap skate
I'm worth 20 mil on Ebay
Gucci Mane ain't ballin'
Young bitch that what yo mouth say

[Bridge]
Ain't no 1 on 1 nigga
He swing, I hit you
I ain't no front for fun nigga
He ridin' with you, he die with you
I ain't finna bite my tongue nigga
Everybody know I don't fuck with you
And I ain't finna to go in no club nigga
Unless they let me in with this slug nigga

[Hook]
Pistol in the party, pistol in the party
They let me in the club, I brought my pistol to the party
Pistol in the party, pistol in the party
They let me in the club, I brought my pistol to the party

[Verse 2]
Bet a million dollars at a month nigga
Quarter mil for a lunch nigga
Hundred dollars on a blunt nigga
Take care hand, don't talk nigga
200 dollars a blunt nigga
This ain't what you want nigga
Got rifles like I'm huntin' niggas
Hand choppers and pumps nigga
Lil chump change nigga keep runnin' out the mouth
Then you gon' be in my trunk nigga
Got a young nigga, just slump niggas
But all I do is just point fingers
Had the niggas fightin' like Jerry Springer
Finger fuck a ho with my trigger finger
I know pimp niggas, I know gang bangers
Same plan, different angle
Want to tangle with Gucci
So your life you want to gamble
Got a wake for you and a funeral
And you Auntie numbers lighted candles
Big Guwap, I keep a banger
Tell the truth I don't like strangers
Trap game is a deadly game but I tote the pistol  like Jesse James

[Bridge]
Ain't no 1 on 1 nigga
He swing, I hit you
I ain't no front for fun nigga
He ridin' with you, he die with you
I ain't finna bite my tongue nigga
Everybody know I don't fuck with you
And I ain't finna to go in no club nigga
Unless they let me in with this slug nigga

[Hook]
Pistol in the party, pistol in the party
They let me in the club, I brought my pistol to the party
Pistol in the party, pistol in the party
They let me in the club, I brought my pistol to the party

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
It’s a motherfuckin' miracle
Yeah it’s a motherfuckin' miracle
I make a half to a whole one
Yeah that’s a motherfuckin' miracle
Broke nigga turn a millionaire
Yeah it’s a motherfuckin' miracle
Got 26’s on my vehicles
And it’s a motherfuckin' miracle

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Nah I ain't motherfuckin' lyrical
Got 50 bowls in my living room
My bedroom is the chicken room
I’m eatin' like it’s Thanksgiving fool
And I do it like a nigga do
I rap up but I pull the trigger too
Your best bet, get a bigger crew
I’m playin' chess while you shootin' pool
Make your next move, be your best move
Run up on Guwap, I’ma let loose
What you mad for, nigga I’m upset too
Pissy yellow jewelry jeweler in the restroom
I'm the type of nigga hit you with a bar stool
You the type of bitch that make-up, wear a costume
You little boys better go and watch some cartoons
Cuz I’m my own man, nigga I’m my own goon
And I swear I got a whip game incredible
God take my breath now if I’m scared of you
I turn your best friend to a fuckin' vegetable
But I’ma stop talkin', I ain’t tryna lecture you
I’m the president, nigga it’s election year
EA dictator, ain’t no re-elections here
Spectator nigga, ten steps ahead of you
Before I dap you up, I'd rather wet you up

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
It’s a motherfuckin' miracle
Yeah it’s a motherfuckin' miracle
I make a half to a whole one
Yeah that’s a motherfuckin' miracle
Broke nigga turn a millionaire
Yeah it’s a motherfuckin' miracle
Got 26’s on my vehicles
And it’s a motherfuckin' miracle

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
AK's, ain’t no pistols here
And we gon' wet you up here
Now is a motherfuckin miracle
How I put a hundred bands in one ear
I got 2 on, 2 hundred bands in my ear
Who this nigga here, standing mighty close to my rear, I’m just keepin' it real
I’ll go shoot his ass and his rear, damage my career
Hundred bands make me stand here
Diamonds come from Sicilys
Bitch I’m just playin', I appear, diamonds crystal clear
Oh you you got them bands, ok dear, we gon' milk you here
My big bro got tattooed tears, and those M&M's
I'm a throw back boy and a blood, I need feminins
Guwap set up shop anywhere, anytime ho
Thugga come with blocks anywhere, any kind ho
Green bells, white bells, oh that smell, yeah that smell
Very rare, we everywhere
You never dare, you in a wheelchair
I’ll take that bitch, slut that bitch
Fuck that bitch, suck that bitch
Send that bitch back to you dead broke, she like money in men
Suck you like a tick for your paper
Just to bring it back to me
She like when I shine like a glacier
My pinky rings are equator
My cups ain't no maper, I meant maple
Apple juice, purple, baby bottles, gerbler
I mean Gerber, kill shit, murder, sipper
Slupper, it’s a motherfuckin' miracle, I’m lyrical

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
It’s a motherfuckin' miracle
Yeah it’s a motherfuckin' miracle
I make a half to a whole one
Yeah that’s a motherfuckin' miracle
Broke nigga turn a millionaire
Yeah it’s a motherfuckin' miracle
Got 26's on my vehicles
And it’s a motherfuckin' miracle

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
We ain’t lookin' at the price tag, fuck that
Baby if you like that, you get that
You gon' love me, you gon' love me

You see I got enough to get your life right
Money make you come, we gon' be fuckin' all night
You gon' love me, you gon' love me

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I can’t lie, I’m into you
Baby what you finna do
Yeah I’m on some other shit
My hoes don’t wear no tennis shoes
I put you on the money, baby roll with me you never lose
I’ll take you to a island, fly you places you ain’t never flew
Every day’s a business move, your boyfriend tighter than a Jew
I’m richer than a average nigga, baby I wouldn’t lie to you
When I say you fine as fuck, baby girl I ain’t tryna flatter you
But your boyfriend is a rainbow and he tryin' to overshadow you
Gucci Mane'll splatter you, I’m the one she walkin' to
I’m sippin' Absolut, I change your longitude and latitude
Bitch show me some gratitude, what's up with this attitude
You mad these bitches jockin' me, they mad because I’m jockin' you

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
We ain’t lookin' at the price tag, fuck that
Baby if you like that, you get that
You gon' love me, you gon' love me

You see I got enough to get your life right
Money make you come, we gon' be fuckin' all night
You gon' love me, you gon' love me

[Verse 2: Verse Simmonds]
I got that Rolex, morn' sex, big dick
I got that Rolex, morn' sex, big dick
I got that Rolex, morn' sex, big dick

Handle mines in the bedroom, got you singin' somethin' like it’s iTunes

We gon' tell them all up, baller call up your job tell em' you out
Soon as you hit the door they gon' Kodak, expensive shit and they know that
I keep you fly like you on that
Louie always in contact
Some say I spoil you, but I can afford to
We gettin' money, we gettin' money
1017 and it’s time to
Turn up, roll up, burn up 'til I’m so stuck
Poppin' bands, I got Rollies
Fuckin' nigga so loaded
It’s whatever you like yeah, it’s whatever you like
Just know you shop 'til you drop, and we gonna fucking tonight

[Chorus: Verse Simmonds]
We ain’t lookin' at the price tag, fuck that

You see I got enough to get your life right

[Verse 1]
Hotel in Arizona
Made us all want to feel like stars
Rental cars with tinted windows
Leave another number for me

[Chorus]
Even if I make it through
That's just something that I have to get used to
That's just something I have to get used to

[Verse 2]
I feel some connection
Between you and me
Well I guess there's some direction
Maybe you can't see

[Chorus]
Even at the interview
That's not something that I'm going to get used to
That's not something I'm going to get used to

[Verse 3]
Hello, can you hear me
Hello, that's all there is
That's all there is

[Outro]
I guess all this history is just a mystery to me
One more worried whisper right in my ear

[Verse 1]
Well, this is a good idea
He wouldn't do it if it wasn't
He wouldn't do it if it wasn't one
Well, my friend fancies you
Oh, what a way to begin it all
You said, "They're always exciting words to hear"

[Chorus]
And they woke up together not quite realising how
Awkwardly stretching and yawning
It's always hard in the morning
And I suppose that's the price you pay
Well, oh, it isn't what it was
She's thinking he looks different today
And now there's nothing left to guess now

[Verse 2]
They left before the lights came on
Because they didn't want to ruin what it was that was brewing
Before they absolutely had to
And how can you wake up with someone you don't love
And not feel slightly fazed by it?
Oh, he had a struggle

[Chorus]
And they woke up together not quite realising how
Awkwardly stretching and yawning
It's always hard in the morning
And I suppose that's the price you pay
Well, oh, it isn't what it was
She's thinking he looks different today
And now there's nothing left to guess now

[Bridge]
Well, quick, let's leave before the lights come on
'Cause then you don't have to see
'Cause then you don't have to see what you've done
Well, quick, let's leave before the lights come on
'Cause then you don't have to see
'Cause then you don't have to see what you've done

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
I'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?
I'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?
I'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?
I'll walk you up

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
I can't be stopped
It's payday and I'm in the candy drop
So for real, Candy Rain flooding your spot
Firestone tires hot, burning the block
For pete's sake I'm a heatwave melting your dot
My ship sail, so I should move units and quick
The whip trail like a mixed, variation of chips
So when I dip, it's kinda ironic
And all I do is hotbox Hydro, call it a carpool
I'm from the west, where the Tec's is drawn like Cartoon Network
Wetshirt, a marksman will become my ex expert
Welcome to school fools, don't get an F for effort
Top Dawg money gang, winter fresh, sunny chain
Bad bitches
Angry paper, got mad riches
Who the fuck you think you're up against? Come again?
Shades darker than the bitch, but I see you niggas
And I, see you niggas, wouldn't wanna be you niggas

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Welcome to the C4
I got the bombs and the rental
Meet me on Central, and Rosecrans
Goddamn, I'm the man, for life
The left coast, bitch get it right
Welcome to the C4, got the bombs and the rental

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
It's Top Dawg
They call me Rock, boy
Shit I came a long way from selling rocks, boy
'Bout my cash money, you can call me hot boy
I throw shots, guns clap, like an encore
B's up, hoes down, that's right blood
Can't be street sweepers, get your ass mopped up
Damn, I'm in a 2008 something
Sitting on chrome buttons, nigga no bluffing
Hit a club, all eyes on my neck
Got $20,000 worth of diamonds on my chest, nigga
Fuck VIP, I'm on the floor chunking up my sets
Twisting fingers with my niggas, blowing swishers, sipping liquor, 'till I'm pissy, fucking bitches, it's so easy
Get the name, tell them the telly nothing but pipe in their belly
.380 keep it on my waist like a celly
K.Dot 'bout to bomb on you niggas, get ready motherfucker

[Hook]

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
I keep a big loaf of the toast, be careful when the toaster pop (Q)
Hashbrowns and all, shooting out tater tots
Around 8 o'clock I let it go for 8 a pop
Taking off wigs like I'm working at a beauty shop
I'm getting money, most success what I'm achieving
Being broke is childish and most of these rappers teething
Still whipping the stick-shift, bottles pop, big sips
Green hash in the back, something to make my heart skip (damn)
You ain't seen a dresser that's fresher and keep it ghetto
Had a gat utter, sing to you; Reuben Studdard
See my team rougher, y'all fat; cream puffer
Your broad serve the whole squad, call her clique fucker
Start to thinking that I'm the best, just sort of speaking
More than decent, and fucking something that's Puerto Rican
I'm cool as ever, not concerned about the weather
Getting every dollar, I'm steady stacking my cheddar
Hard as ever, y'all cats soft as a feather
Super clever, outdoing me? Nigga never
Try to fuck me out my cash, dawg I'm no pussy
Got big cajones, my nigga you can't douche me
Look, hard as a rock, look, yo I'm hard to smash
New in-dash, bump loud, speakers blast
Heard a couple of your songs, your whole shit was trash
Fucking over the game, your whole squad is ass

[Hook]

[Verse 4: BO]
Yeah, I tell 'em, I tell 'em, bang, bow, pop the man shit
As a young whippersnapper, been toting guns in my pants
Niggas bitches, niggas snitching, yeah they taking the stand
Cause a nigga on the block moves a couple of grand
Coming in wild, with 32 guns, and 10 guys, 3 Puerto Rican bitches, and a couple of 9s
Shit, BO never stopping, cause the flow is a headache, and my swag is a Oxycotin
It's Top Dawg money gang, 20 grand verte chain
Bentley GT, 3 pieces, nigga fuck a raise
Hustle like I'm broke man, advise you to do the same
Nigga rob me? Better knock it off man
Shit, these niggas teddy bear soft
They pull up to new coupe, watch me fucking knock their top off
Bone marrow falling off, Mr. Swag dance, still lean, to the left, when they taking my pants
Try to play this MC like he was light, cause you can get it worse than Harold did at that red light
Pimping 24/7 like the day to the night
Now you mad cause your girlfriend giving head right

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
Moving through the block like a centipede
No rooftop, who hot? I'mma show them where the antifreeze
I hit the dealership, and tell them hand me keys, like a grand pianist
Damage anything said, then landing on top of your bitch, oops I tripped
I'm clumsy like Michelle Williams, or Jaleel White
I feel like a Predator, and none of you Danny Glovers are ready for, Alien tactics
The god is back, they're on their knees praying like a mantis
As I perform like Santa Clause
Pause TVs in the Phantom
Bitches on my left and my right like I pant them
Dancing on the coast, emerging from the smoke
Pimping in my blood, tell doc to check my pulse
They knew that was K.Dot the gemini, with another cut like a Samurai
Anything else is uncivilized
Fucker

[Chorus]
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon

[Verse 1]
It's so noisy at the fair
But all your friends are there
And the candy floss you had
And your mother and your dad

[Chorus]
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon

[Verse 2]
There's a girl just down the aisle
Oh to turn and see her smile
You can hear the words she wrote
As you read the hidden note

[Chorus]
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon

[Verse 3]
Now you're underneath the stairs
And you're giving back some glares
To the people who you met
And it's your first cigarette

[Chorus]
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon

[Verse 4]
Now you say you're leaving home
Because you want to be alone
Ain't it funny how you feel
When you're findin' out it's real?

[Chorus]
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon
You're leavin' there too soon
Oh to live on Sugar Mountain
With the barkers and the colored balloons
You can't be 20 on Sugar Mountain
Though you're thinking that
You're leavin' there too soon

[Intro]
Something inside the cards I know is right
Don't want to live somebody else's life
This is what I want to be and this is what I give to you because I get it free
She smiles while I do my time
I could die for you
Oh, this life I choose

[Verse]
I'm here to be your only go-between
To tell you of the sights these eyes have seen
What I really want to do is turn it into motion, beauty that I can't abuse
You know that I use my senses, too

[Bridge]
You can see that it's only everywhere
I'd take it all in then I'd find a way to share

[Pre-Chorus]
Come along and go along with me
Wander with me, yo, it's all for free

[Chorus]
I could die for you; what you wanna do?
Oh, this life I choose
I could die for you; what you wanna do?
Oh, this life I choose

[Bridge]
Come again and tell me where you wanna go
What it means for me to be with you alone
Close the door and no one has to know
How we are

[Pre-Chorus]
Come along and go along with me
Wander with me, yo, it's all for free

[Chorus]
I could die for you; what you wanna do?
Oh, this life I choose
I could die for you; what you wanna do?
Oh, this life I choose, make me wanna say
I could die for you; what you wanna do?
Oh, this life I choose
I could die for you; what you wanna do?
Oh, this life I choose
{Verse 1}
I'm still the one the rappers look up to
When they want to know how to do it
And they can’t figure out why the fuck you still love
That nigga you were tryin to ruin
Probably cuz a nigga knows shit from sugar
And could see through what you doin
But you made that bed and you bathed that nigga so the mob will start a chewin
Saw a nigga more cuz I know a let ya down and the thing that we pursuin
Don’t wanna leave but gotta go right now cuz I gotta face the music
Sky can all but be blue and calm
Specially with a storm blowin
Just be strong, we done seen it before so you know we can make it through it
I know it kinda hurt but don’t let em see you sweat
Just act like there's nothing to it
They laughin right now but they gon cry later, wouldn’t tell ya it if it wasn’t true
Come here baby, it’s alright, stop boo-hooin
Daddy gon be back up that real real soon
Come here

{Hook}
WHY! Why you gotta make yo mamma cry?
Hah? Can't Stay on the street cuz thats where ya gon die

WHY! Why you gotta make yo mamma cry?
Hah? Can't Stay on the street cuz thats where ya gon die

Come here, come here

{Verse 2}
Left right. I been right. And I ain't gotta get right
I'm Real, I’m straight up like a motherfuckin pinstrip
I called but you been tied, rolled but you been like
Does a motherfucker reckon tell er gesundheit?
Tell that motherfucker you was in the big house
Tell the motherfucker what you made up and
Tell the motherfuckers how they used to treat you
Tell em what you gonna do when you get out
Shake them fuckin streets, break them fuckin beats
Knock that motherfucker down, tear that bitch to pieces
Rappers in for the spot that I’m runnin
Nigga proud of the place that you hung in
Tell me who gon be gone for that long
Then get back on top. How many niggas ever done that?
Sure that wasn't nothing but a setback
Show em just how a real nigga come back
Make him wish that he never would’ve did that
And the motherfuckin ass gon regret that
That dog gon have his day
You’ll see that when it’s over, don't fret, don’t cry no more
Come lay on daddy's shoulder

{Hook}
WHY! Why you gotta make yo mamma cry?
Hah? Can't Stay on the street cuz thats where ya gon die

Come here
Come here, let me talk to yall
Come here, come here
Come here, let me talk to yall
{Verse 3}
I’m still hard like I always was
So I imagine if a nigga ain’t have to leave
One of the coldest motherfuckers that
Ever touched the mic, ain't no tellin where I'd be
Probly some where at the top of the pile at a height that you can’t believe
And what you did and you didn’t do
During my career, We gone keep between you and me

Intro: The young kid Fox...Lupe Fiasco... Life

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
From city to city, I really did it for y'all
From the itty bitty small, to the really really tall
Where they paw, and they living in a shelter
Begging with their kids, they're too helpless to help her
If you walk in trailer park today
Or a park where the ground is too harsh to lay
Or the projects where there's no park to play
And it's too dark to read
And you're too marked to leave
Where wick only buys juicy juice and kicks
It's a trip because the youth is usually used to this
And that's strength
And you gotta be strong
When the dramas on your back
And your clothes don't match
And your father is gone
And on top of all that
The water isn't on
And your dishes don't match
The teachers say they only come to school to flunk
But there's some that only go to school for lunch
And that's life

[Hook]

This one goes out to all of the children
Hanging out of them buildings
While they just watching the asphalt grow
Now some of them got bright futures
And some will never know
Because they say it's a miracle
If we live to see 24
This is for them babies with no fathers
For the people that's starving
Living out here on these streets
To that man that's working too hard
Just to feed his family
Working 2 and 3 jobs
Ain't got time for play at all
This is his life

[Children Singing]

This is for my people out there hustling
To the family that's struggling
Living from paycheck to paycheck
?
The baby needs a pair of shoes
And on top of all that
We've got to deal with self-esteem issues
This is for the ones that go and tell
They say no matter what you do
Money can't buy you happiness
And this is for all we've sacrificed
For all of the pains
For everyday we cry
We just have to keep living our life!

[Children Singing]

[Verse 1]
I guess you've heard about the Bermuda triangle
There's something going on
Nobody seems to know just what it is
And the airforce won't let on
It might be hole down in the ocean
Yeah or a fog that won't let go
It might be some crazy people talking
Or somebody that we ought to know
Down in Bermuda, the pale blue sea
Way down in the triangle, it's easy to believe
Now here's one
You see strange shapes in moonlight
And shadows in the night
They said that wingtip seemed to brush their faces
And strangers stole their sight
Way down in the triangle
Where the sea was smooth as glass
Giving you one answer to a question
That you never thought you'd ask
Ah down in Bermuda, in the pale blue sea
Way down in Bermuda, yeah it's easy to believe
Down in the triangle, it's easy to believe

[Chorus]
They came from Galveston
They came from New Orleans
And then from Bloomington, and Delaware
They used St. Petersburg, they came from Tampa
And then from Mexico, it doesn't matter where
They all completely share
All of those ships and planes
A great big mystery that cannot be explained
Down in Bermuda, in the pale blue sea

[Verse 2]
You're feeling safe in your harbour
And everything seems certain
Right next to Palm Beach and Key Biscane
Behind a velvet curtain
But then the moon goes grey with worry
And the sea turns a pale white
You better believe something strange is going on tonight
Down in Bermuda, ah, the pale blue sea
Bermuda Triangle, yeah, it's easy to believe
Down in the Triangle, it's easy to believe

[Chorus]
They came from Galveston
They came from New Orleans
And then from Bloomington, and Delaware
Bermuda, the pale blue sea

[Intro]
It's the world's greatest, y'all
It's the world's greatest
The world's greatest

[Verse 1]
I am a mountain
I am a tall tree, oh
I am a swift wind
Sweepin' the country
I am a river
Down in the valley, oh
I am a vision
And I can see clearly

[Bridge]
If anybody ask you who I am
Just stand up tall
Look 'em in the face and say

[Chorus]
I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey, I made it
I'm the world's greatest
And I'm that little bit of hope
When my back's against the ropes
I can feel it
I'm the world's greatest

[Verse 2]
I am a giant
I am an eagle, oh
I am a lion
Down in the jungle
I am a marchin' band
I am the people, oh
I am a helpin' hand
I am a hero

[Bridge]
If anybody ask you who I am
Just stand up tall
Look 'em in the face and say

[Chorus]
I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey, I made it
I'm the world's greatest
And I'm that little bit of hope
When my back's against the ropes
I can feel it
I'm the world's greatest

[Bridge 2]
In the ring of life, I'll reign love
And the world will notice a king
Where there is darkness I'll shine a light
And the mirrors of success reflect in me

[Chorus]
I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey, I made it
I'm the world's greatest
And I'm that little bit of hope
When my back's against the ropes
I can feel it
I'm the world's greatest
I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey, I made it
I'm the world's greatest
And I'm that little bit of hope
When my back's against the ropes
I can feel it
I'm the world's greatest

[Chorus]
I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey, I made it
I'm the world's greatest
And I'm that little bit of hope
When my back's against the ropes
I can feel it
I'm the world's greatest

[Bridge 3 over Chorus]
I saw the light
At the end of a tunnel
Believe in the pot of gold
At the end of the rainbow
And faith was right there
To pull me through, yeah
Used to be locked doors
Now I can just walk on through

[Outro]
It's the greatest
Can you feel it?
Say the greatest
Can you feel it?

[Bridge 3 over Outro]
I saw the light
At the end of a tunnel
Believe in the pot of gold
At the end of the rainbow
And faith was right there
To pull me through, yeah
Used to be locked doors
Now I can just walk on through
Hey
Uh Hey
It's the greatest
I'm that star up in the sky

[Chorus]
I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey, I made it
I'm the world's greatest
And I'm that little bit of hope
When my back's against the ropes
I can feel it
I'm the world's greatest

I'ma make them become the best of friends
Them ass cheeks, girl
Them ass cheeks like twins
But which one was born first, baby?
Said, which one is older, and by how many minutes?
Girl, your ass cheeks got a mind of their own
Which one had better SAT scores, girl?
I don't know, I don't know
Baby, if your ass had a face
What expression would it be making when
I put my tongue inside that asshole and lick around like
I'm tryna have some shitty soup?
Girl, fuckin' with you is like
Fuckin' with a girl with a nice ass
That's a lot of ass
And don't forget about them titties, girl
Don't forget about them nipples, no!
They get hard when I rub 'em gently
And pinch 'em just a little bit
But I ain't tryna hurt you, girl
No, I don't wanna hurt you, girl
Unless you talk about the way that
Your pussy gon' be hurtin' after I get done with it
Girl, I'm just tryna have some fun with it, oh

'Cause I'll punch you in the motherfuckin' face
I'll hit a bitch, oh, I'll hit a bitch
But if you suck my dick good, then we can get along

Girl, how does my dick taste after a show
When I still haven't showered?
You suck on my balls, you a champion
Girl, you a champion, girl, baby, baby

Punch you, give that ass a bloody nose
Ooh, I'm fuckin' crazy
And I wouldn't marry you if you fuckin' paid me a million dollars
'Cause you ain't shit but a real good pussy
And to be honest that pussy ain't even that good
I just think it is because when you horny, everything seems incredible
You probably just a regular ass bitch and I'm trippin'
Oh, I'm on a roll, girl, I'm trippin'
Missionary, doggystyle
Ride the dick, get wild, girl

I know I'm gettin' fat, so are you down with that?
Ooh, baby, give that ass a slap, yeah, I like it, girl
And don't you try and put your tongue in my asshole
'Cause that's way too nasty for me
And I ain't gay, but I like a girl to rub on my asshole
When she sucks my dick, is that weird?
Maybe, girl, when I eat your pussy, can you feel my beard?
It's crazy, girl
I'm a nasty motherfucker
In the Gap wearin' khakis, motherfucker
And don't you dare ask me for a rubber
'Cause I don't have those
Ayy! What the fuck's wrong?
Can I talk about your ass in a song?
Have you ever seen that ass in a thong?
Ooh, get low, baby! Oh, girl

Ooh, that's some player shit
See, at the end of the night
I might get you a Gatorade 'cause, bitch, you need to catch your breath
'Cause I just fucked the shit out of you
Ooh, I fucked the shit out of you, but don't you bleed on my sheets
Girl, you bled on my sheets!
Now it's been red for a week
You bled on my sheets and stained them
My dreams have been red for a week
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And I just want you to know that you are not mine
Oh, yeah
I heard you fucked Justin Bieber
Let me tell you that's fine
Oh, baby, that's fine
But let me ask you one question, girl
Was his dick bigger than mine?
Don't tell me, "Yes," I might get depressed
Oh, I'm walkin' in Rite Aid
And I see the milk section
What kind of milk do I get? Baby, what kind of milk do I get?
There's so many choices, so much variety of milk
I couldn't help but think of you
And all the things I want to do in the milk section
Girl, me and you is like the milk section
But sometimes you need orange juice
And sometimes you need a little bit of both
But don't drink too much milk 'cause you'll be congested
Oh, and somethin' manifested in my mind
I said, "Hey! Hey! Cashier, you didn't give me the correct change"
And I can't deal with that right now
'Cause my mom gave me twenty dollars and said
"Bring back my damn change"
You gon' make that lady go insane, yeah
You gon' make her lose her mind, oh, girl
I know what you like when you think of the perfect man
I bet you didn't think of me
And that's why I hate you, girl
But love is what we makin', girl
And you a little sloppy, naked girl
You might wanna tighten that up
'Cause ain't no famous celebrity gon' fuck you
When you look like that
Oh, you gotta get good, start eatin' on the right track
And, baby, it's alright that
The first night, you let me pipe that
Never been with no white rapper
How was it?
Ooh, how was it, girl?
Was it everything you dreamed, or was it disappointin'?
Oh shit, that might need some ointment
Oh, girl, you ain't no ho, you just know what you want
And I got what you need, ooh, I got what you need
So, give that pussy to me
And I'ma do the right thing, I'ma do the white thing
And treat that pussy disrespectfully
Oh, your pussy don't get what it deserves
I'ma cum fast, it's cool, jack myself off, then I come back
Ooh, fuck that
Baby, I'll fuck you and rap in your ear at the same time
Pick a song, I'm a jukebox, girl
And I can sing to you
You got some friends? Please bring 'em too
'Cause we could have a threesome
Sorry, I think I missed that note, I missed that note
Oh, let me tell you this story
Ooh, I was walkin' at the flea market the other day
And I saw
Half-price lamps
And I scored, 'cause my livin' room's lackin' some light
So, I bargained with the nice lady and said
"Can I get four for the price of three?
It's alright, you see? Just be nice to me"
And she said, "Who the fuck you think I am?
This a 1970 vintage lamp, you can't find these anymore
Don't even sell them in stores"
That's how serious this dumb bitch was about her lamps
I said, "I know your pussy is dry, but this dick gon' make it damp
Fuckin' tramp, that's what you are
So, bitch, put them lamps in my car
And I'ma go home, and I'ma watch late-night television"
Said, I'ma watch late-night television, girl
I can't pick between Leno or Letterman
Leno or Letterman? Leno or Letterman?
And I like Fallon too, and I like Kimmel too
And I like Craig Ferguson
But I can't understand a single fuckin' word that he says, girl
All these words in my head, what happened to SNL?
It used to be so funny, and who the fuck is Fred Armisen?
Baby, baby, how'd he get that job?
But let me not spend no time hatin' on another man tryna get his
'Cause I'm just tryna get mine, and I'm gettin' off subject
Isn't this a love song? No
This is just a fuck song, whoa
So that's what I'ma do, ooh, baby
Let me tell another story
Earlier today, I was flippin' through channels on the cable when I
When I came across one of those commercials for sick dogs
And I hate that shit, I hate eatin' a cheeseburger
And watchin' a video about animal cruelty, 'cause I know that shit happens
But I like to forget it and enjoy my cheeseburger, yeah
'Cause I can't help but like it, girl
I know th—, I know they treat those cows like shit
And I ain't really with that, but I ain't no gay-ass vegetarian
I like beef, yeah, I like beef
Oh, baby, I like beef
Baby, oh, let me tell you somethin' else
And I was on the internet the other day
Did somethin' a little vain
I typed myself into Google verch—, Google ver—, Google Search... 'scuse me
And what did I see?
Oh, you ask me, what did I see? I'll tell you right now
I saw some shit
I clicked on the first picture, and I enlarged it to full screen
And what did I see? You wanna know?
What I saw was so disgusting that I wanted to retire
I'ma tell you now
What I saw, what I motherfuckin' saw
What did I see?
I had something stuck in my teeth
I think it's lettuce, girl
From that turkey burger I ate when I was out at Turkey World
Oh, baby, do you like some jerky, girl?
No, no, fuck that
Suck my motherfuckin' dick
I don't play around, I'ma take this dick, I'ma lay it down
Oh, yo, I'm not gay, I love pussy
Ooh, I dream of pussy, I draw pussy
I write about pussy like it is some type of false idol
It really is 'cause y'all be prayin' on that pussy
Y'all be worshippin' that pussy
Y'all be on Instagram commenting bitches' pictures
You thirsty for that pussy
And I ain't really with that
Oh, I ain't with that, girl, yeah, yeah
Would you fuck me?
Would you fuck me if I looked more like Channing Tatum?
Is that the type of guy you like?
*Exhale, laughter*

[Verse 1]
Come on now, don't you want to see
This thing that's happening to me
Like Moses has power over sea
So you've got a power over me

Come on now, don't you want to know
That you're a refuge, somewhere I can go
And you're air that, air that I can breathe
You're my golden opportunity

If I only could
And you know I would
And baby I, oh baby I

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh

If you're gonna break down you can break on me

[Chorus]
'Cause you're the one I love
You're the one I love

So you lost your trust
And you never should have
And you never should have
But don't break your back
If you ever see this
But don't answer that

[Chorus]
In a bulletproof vest
With the windows all closed
I'll be doing my best
I'll see you soon
In a telescope lens
And when all you want is friends
I'll see you soon

[Verse 2]
So they came for you
They came snapping at your heels
They come snapping at your heels
But don't break your back
If you ever hear this
But don't answer that

[Chorus]
In a bulletproof vest
With the windows all closed
I'll be doing my best
I'll see you soon
In a telescope lens
And when all you want is friends
I'll see you soon
I'll see you soon

[Outro]
I know, you lost your trust
I know, you lost your trust
I Know, don't lose your trust
I know, you lost your trust

[Verse 1]
Hell yeah
A blind boy sees a green girl
She drives a green car through a dream world
She meets up with a green club
And talks of saving the earth from itself
A blind boy saw a blue man
Who rides a blue bus through a nightmare
He leaves word to a blue home
But the blue seems different since she's passed away

[Pre-Chorus]
And the same boy with sunken eyes saw me
And described yellow so perfectly

[Chorus]
Said he's watching
Watching
Watching
With eyes like sky
Eyes like I've never seen

[Verse 2]
A blind boy became a kind man
Who painted white lights on a canvas
He once said he didn't write songs
Cause making music would be selfish
And back then he saw the flags fly
Seen them fight and divide for it
He said war is for those who foresee it
But what good is border to me yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
And the same man with sunken eyes saw me
And described yellow so perfectly

[Chorus]
Said he's watching
Watching
Watching
With eyes like sky
Eyes like I've never seen

[Bridge]
I said "I wish you could see the ocean"
He said "I wish you could see hope"
I said "have you ever seen the mountain?"
He said "no, but my faith could move those"
Ohhh woah
I said "I wish you could see the stars"
He told me I should see love
Love
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
Said he's watching
Watching
Watching
With eyes like sky
Eyes like I've never seen

[Intro]
Ahhhh
Ahhhh

[Chorus]
Don't you wonder sometimes
'Bout sound and vision?

[Verse]
Blue, blue, electric blue
That's the colour of my room
Where I will live
Blue, blue
Pale blinds drawn all day
Nothing to read, nothing to say
Blue, blue
I will sit right down
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
And I will sing
Waiting for the gift of sound and vision
Drifting into my solitude
Over my head

[Chorus]
Don't you wonder sometimes
'Bout sound and vision?

[Verse 1]
Easy Mac, rap slick and sensational
Foolin' fools out their shoes
Like the first of april
I'm aimin' low
With words guarentee to make them fold
I'll be remembered next december but your name will go
My name remains rhymes sent to ya brain
Attention sustain these other cats resent and complain
My minds bent and insane till the lyrics are complete
Spittin' fear in the ears to all those who compete
I never skip a beat, the kid is swisher sweet
You can picture me cheesin' then my album hits the street
With the words that sick to speak, so I spit it in my sleep
Countin' sheep, I'm about the heat
Provin' anyone wrong who was doubtin' me
They say "Malcolm please get a new career"
It appears that they fear who I'll be in a year
But I'm creatin' racket, makin' tracks up in the attic
See my life changed after I heard Illmatic
It was drastic, automatic rap and fantastic
I'm jurassic, mic melts like plastic
I got the gift and you wish that you had it
So you study hip hop and you read How-to-do's
Thinkin' that it's helpin' but you learnin' how to lose
See I was born gifted, lift or get lifted
If rappin' ain't my life then what is it

[Verse 2]
Ugh, rhymes is my dome's home on a gold throne
Spittin' sick burnin' holes in the ozone
I rock clothes that don't fit me
Flows that spit quickly
And rip cities, kickin' clowns that hit midi's
Cause I piss busy, I'm sorry you just missed me
I can't bare what you spit cause it's grizzly
I kick shit you can't spit nit wit sit quick
And let me twist back my Pit' fit
The best yet, blessed the cash wrecked
In fresh sweats with more words than last breaths
Your next guess with more swords for breast pests
Take your best guess, cause war is the next step
I got a passion for rappin'
I'm passin the has-beens who passive reactions
You askin' for action, I'm clashin' up your atoms
Your ass will get flattin' be askin' what happened

[Verse 3]
I'm sleep deprived, but managin' to keep my mind
And when rest try to find me I seek to hide
Bleed from eyes, they been open for too long
My body needs sleep but these demons is too strong
My insomnia lets me spit the monologues
Stayin' up writin' as the night is goin' on and on
Out my mind, I'm a maniac insane with rap
Raises, now the brain is scratched players playin' haters at
Traitors need to watch they back
Cause I know just where they at
Scared to rap, to where I'm at
Lookin' and I'm starin' back
Hatin's say your prayers and that
Pittsburgh that's where I'm at
We true hip hop, and we the rarest cats

[Verse 1]
Baby, I've been
Breaking glass in your room again
Listen

[Verse 2]
Don't look at the carpet
I drew something awful on it
See

[Bridge]
You're such a wonderful person
But you got problems
I'll never touch you

[Verse 1]
Hold me tight
Keep me cool
Going mad
Don't know what to do
Do I need a friend?
Well, I need one now

[Chorus]
All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe you

[Verse 2]
All I've done
I've done for me
All you gave
You gave for free
I gave nothing in return
And there's little left of me

[Chorus]
All the days of my life
All the days of my life
All the days I owe you

[Bridge]
In red-eyed pain I'm knocking on your door again
My crazy brain in tangles
Pleading for your gentle voice
Those storms keep pounding through my head and heart
I pray you'll soothe my sorry soul

[Chorus]
All the days of my life
(All the days of my life)
All the days of my life
(All the days of my life)
All the days I owe you
(Aah)
All the days of my life
(All the days of my life)
All the days of my life
(All the days of my life)
All the days I owe you
(Aah)
All the days of my life
(All the days of my life)
All the days of my life
(All the days of my life)
All the days I owe you
(Aah)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Hold ya Rollie up, hold ya Rollie up
If you’ve got a Rollie then hold it up
If you ain’t got a Rollie then step it up
If you got a Rollie then keep it up
Hold ya Rollie up, hold ya Rollie up

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Since my money fat I’m throwin stacks
Patron shots I’m throwin back
We look good, I’mma spend some racks
Turn round back and a brick squad tat
Taz brought it back but it still don’t pass
Push that Jag with a bag of cash
All this stash, and I hope it lasts
And I’ve never seen the bitch, suck dick so fast
I ain’t even know you was rich like that
How the hell a nigga pull a bitch like that?
How the hell a nigga got a watch like that?
How a nigga face to face with some shit like that?
Better have a mil, we’ve been like that
Tell the hoes how the goose is like that
Whole clique, rock ‘n’ roll looks like that
Got chick like this, so we flex like that
I’m serious, nigga, they’re curious nigga
These thugs have a bitch delirious nigga
Don’t see it, nigga, can’t hear them niggas
Don’t stand there, and don’t feel them nigga
I’m the trill nigga since a lil nigga
Only difference got it bigger, nigga
She a eye catcher let the car catch her
But it’s chainless so let the watch go

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Hold ya Rollie up, hold ya Rollie up
If you’ve got a Rollie then hold it up
If you ain’t got a Rollie then step it up
If you got a Rollie then keep it up
Hold ya Rollie up, hold ya Rollie up
If you’ve got a Rollie then hold it up
If you ain’t got a Rollie then step it up
If you got a Rollie then keep it up

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
A dope boy watch is a Rolex
Every dope boy dream to have a Rolex
Everybody in the hood want a Rolex
You better keep your pistol with your Rolex
Ride, smoking, counting in that Rolls Royce
I brought the streets back, it needed my voice
Took the nigga for a check and bought a white Porsche
Bought a gold Rollie just to match the dope
You want a Yacht Master, know your mathematics
Hold your rollie up if you a real trapper
I’m not a real rapper, I’ve got a real check
Real street nigga with a Rolex

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Hold ya Rollie up, hold ya Rollie up
If you’ve got a Rollie then hold it up
If you ain’t got a Rollie then step it up
If you got a Rollie then keep it up
Hold ya Rollie up, hold ya Rollie up
If you’ve got a Rollie then hold it up
If you ain’t got a Rollie then step it up
If you got a Rollie then keep it up

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]
There’s a plan, masterpiece, no AP
64 Gs told 'em, "freeze me"
My diamonds kick it, Jet Li
I’m balling hard, no referee
Brought Presi watches for the homies
Crime pay, fuck police
Came a long way from that Benny
Getting topped off of my Bentley!
It’s a Daytona, no Hublot
Got a pink slip, no car note
I’m balling hard, fucking up a check
Real street nigga, I ain’t gotta flex
I can count a mil, don’t break a sweat
That iced out Rollie got her pussy wet
Got your little brother throwing up the set
Got your lil sister throwing up the set
Waka Flocka Flame!

[Interlude: Waka Flocka Flame]
Drunker than a motherfucker screaming Rolex gang
If you own a Rollie, getting money, do your thang
You a broke nigga, kill yourself – Kurt Cobain
Squad!

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Hold ya Rollie up, hold ya Rollie up
If you’ve got a Rollie then hold it up
If you ain’t got a Rollie then step it up
If you got a Rollie then keep it up
Hold ya Rollie up, hold ya Rollie up
If you’ve got a Rollie then hold it up
If you ain’t got a Rollie then step it up
If you got a Rollie then keep it up

[Intro]

When uhh, you be at the lunch table
This that right here

[Verse 1]
Uh yeah
I put my team on
Now we in the game
But I remember days when I ain't have no one to lean on
I learned to hold my own
They sayin' the skys the limit
Take a hundred dollar bill and make a paper plane
And try to make a name
And when you're done giving your all
You give your everything
You got what it takes
I told the world my song
They lovin' it
You can't tell me nothin', cause my whole clique's stuntin'
Boy wassup

[Hook]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
So where you goin', your life's on a road
From the party to the plane and your name's in the light show
You find your way back home
Away from all the pressure and that women tryin' to stress you
Find a new one
You've reached a new phase
They got you lookin' at tomorrow like a new state
And not a new day
To some it may seem wrong
But fuck it, cause I'm good weed puffin'
And my whole team stuntin'
Boy wassup

[Hook]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]

Sleep when the sun come up

[Hook]
Yeah, yeah
Ha, ha, ha
Yeah

Scarface, world's mine, running back

80,000 in London, Wembley
90,000 Morocco, and I'm just getting warmed up, papo (Haha)
Catch me with RedOne in Stockholm

All of them sweet, azucar, azucar

I'm from the city, where they stretch ya like slinkys (305)
And now I'm doing shows in Helsinki (Finland)
I know what ya'll thinking, you're thinking
That you can outthink me, but you can't frankly
I'm out for the Benjies, Frankies (C-notes)
Just 'cause you ain't me, don't hate me
As a matter fact, you should thank me
Even if you don't, you're welcome Yankees
Zig-a, zig-a, zig-a, zig-a, zow
Who got the keys of the world, now?
Yours truly (Blaow)

[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I only got a couple bucks in my pocket, fuck
Spittin' out these bars like it tastes bad, yuck
I'm way too much, just shrug like, "Shucks"
Every time a hater diss a homie, I don't give a fuck
Hell yeah, it's Most Dope, bitch, just got it tatted on me
The only motherfuckers comin' to the after-party
No time for bullshit and no bad advice
Been gettin' buzzed, spittin' crack, tryna bag it tight
'Cause I'm tryna stay kinda low-key
Let all the OG's get all the glory
Always pay homage to the dudes who came before me
Hidin' from the top 'cause I heard that it was lonely
Never goin' back to the old me, so here's the new me
A lot of motherfuckers starrin' in this movie
Heard it's impossible to do me
Thumbs up, bitch, everything groovy

[Chorus]
Do you remember
When you was different from the man you are right now?
Gettin' high in the car right now (Right now)
I'm just tryna have a ball right now
Swear I want it all right now (Right now)
Do you remember
When you was different from the man you are right now?
Gettin' high in the car right now (Right now)
I'm just tryna have a ball right now
Swear I want it all right now (Right now)

[Verse 2]
If it ain't stuck in your head, I'll get the nail gun
Delivery like the dude you get your mail from
Happy shit how these bitches wag they tails
You can bet you haven't lived if you never even failed once
Takin' over shit, call me Pilgrim
And now we got fans who wanna film him
To be honest, it's a little much to comprehend
'Cause everywhere I go, they know they gotta let me in
Stay humble though, mama raised a gentleman
Told me, "Be polite when you introduced to Benjamin"
But now I'm spendin' them, actin' like the president
Try and shake the world like I'm jumpin' round some gelatin
And they think they Tempur-Pedic
I'ma get it though, best believe it
This is shit they shoulda kept a secret
But fuck it, I'ma let you see it

[Chorus]
Do you remember
When you was different from the man you are right now?
Gettin' high in the car right now (Right now)
I'm just tryna have a ball right now
Swear I want it all right now (Right now)
Do you remember
When you was different from the man you are right now?
Gettin' high in the car right now (Right now)
I'm just tryna have a ball right now
Swear I want it all right now (Right now)

[Intro: Yo-Landi Visser]
Nkosi sikelel' iAfrika

[Verse 1: Ninja, Yo-Landi Visser]
Yo, check me out now
Yo, this is why I'm hot
I don't give a fack
Yo, I'll kick a rap over someone else's track
I represent South Africa
I put it on the map
South Africa, man I heard that place is fuckin' wack
When you say South Africa
The first things that come to mind
Is yup, racism, apartheid and crime
Fuck a racist
Motherfuckers is stuck in '89
But the crimes still wildin'
Word to my 9

[Verse 2: Yo-Landi Visser]
This is why I'm hot
I don't have a job
I just make up raps then I learn them off by heart
Now I'm blowing up, yes, why?
'Cause I rhyme tight
Yo, my flow is hot
Just like the guy from Twilight
I can't believe that Kristen
Went and had a fling, yo
Now Robert is single
And ready to mingle
I'm hot 'cause my lingo
On the mic is zef
Spelt Z to the E to the motherfuckin' F

[Hook: Ninja & Yo-Landi Visser]
This is why I'm hot, this is why I'm hot
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot
This is why I'm hot, this is why I'm hot
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot
I'm hot because I'm zef
You ain't because you not
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot
I'm hot because I'm zef

Let's see what you got
Yo, hit it while it's hot

[Verse 1: Therapist]
Yo you up on some shit fuck
Cuz every word I utter's intent you faggot
Fucking with this is like punching cement
I know your type, you bluffing with tough talk you scared to brawl
Never stepping but your mouth is running marathons
Its hopeless, I'm focused, I won't miss
Any foes want to oppose get your throats slit
You can't call it, I'm flawless this shit is so sick
If I learnt from my mistakes I wouldn't know shit (get it? Damn)
Know this even if your voice is deep
Niggas sufferin' from arthritis they joints is weak
Know if cats know where the motherfuckin' turf is at
You act bad but you rhyme even worse than that
Yo funny how tables turn and life pays your dues
Earn your stripes, never be concerned with ice cuz check it out
The more money you pay for rent, is just givin' me even more reason to take this shit
The main event, servin' niggas the way y'all run through these herds with these words is distrubin' niggas
So leave it alone, I'm zoned and never leaving my throne
No need to play games I'm in a league of my own
Its therapist niggas, dismiss you dick kissers, for you to get bigger than shits slimmer than stick figures
You faggots can't stand how much love I get, but if you don't bump my shit then suck my dick
I'm taking over, I got what it takes to make it over the top you trynna diss me to stop and think it over
I'm greater than any nigga you feeling the most stepped on stage got arrested for stealing the show mothafucka
Yo my brain in the forecast, Therapist broadcast Philly to North tax(?) you really don't want that
Therapist and meddafore niggas remeber the name remember tha Game niggas

[Verse 1]
Time after time, you been copping mine
Like, "Can I have a good time at yours tonight?"
Cause every time we try to get close
There is always something that I'm thinking about

[Pre-Chorus]
(You want me)
XXXO, XXXO
(You want me)
XXXO, XXXO
(You want me)
XXXO, XXXO

[Chorus]
You want me be somebody who I'm really not
You want me be somebody who I'm really not
You want me be somebody who I'm really not
You want me be somebody who I'm really not

[Verse 2]
A knock at the door, and then we hit the floor
And all I know is you leave me wanting more
I don't let it show, but I think you know
Cause you tweeting me like Tweety Bird on your iPhone

[Pre-Chorus]
(You want me)
XXXO, XXXO
(You want me)

[Intro]
Mr. Worldwide – I’m self-made, I’m self-paid
I grew up with no daddy, I’m from Miami Dade
I’m self-made, I’m self-paid
I grew up with no daddy, I’m from Miami Dade

[Verse 1]
Mouth signed check, ass can’t cash
One-time Lebron boss, D-Wade flash
I can’t forget that boy UD, Udonis Has
I’m from Miami Dade County, born and raised there
Mouth full of golds and diamonds, but talk is cheap
There’s rules and codes, in Dade Country streets
Y’all break rules and codes to talk shit on beats
No te equivoques mi hijito, Miami’ll bring the heat

[Chorus]
I’m self-made, I’m self-paid
I grew up with no daddy, I’m from Miami Dade
I’m self-made, I’m self-paid
I grew up with no daddy, I’m from Miami Dade
Welcome to Dade County…
Welcome to, welcome to Dade County
Welcome to, welcome to Dade County
Welcome to, welcome to Dade County

[Woooooooooooooooooooh!]

[Verse 2]
Here's a deposition, watch what you speak
Who’s the definition of Miami? Me
I move cultures, don’t believe me – watch and see
Ask Barack Obama, he’ll bet the White House on me
You got money, yeah – yeah, that’s sweet
But we all know Baby and Slim really eat
You talk Miami, if you talkin’ heat
Moral of the story: don’t shit where you eat

[Chorus]
I’m self-made, I’m self-paid
I grew up with no daddy, I’m from Miami Dade
I’m self-made, I’m self-paid
I grew up with no daddy, I’m from Miami Dade
Welcome to Dade County…
Welcome to, welcome to Dade County
Welcome to, welcome to Dade County
Welcome to, welcome to Dade County

[Outro]
I had to do this for my city dog
It’s something that I love so deeply
I don’t wanna be 305 Miami Dade County
I am 305 Miami Dade County
I bleed 305 Miami Dade County
So when we show love to those
That get their city destroyed by a hurricane
And then they come down here
Y faltan al respeto
Hazme el favor y para de comer tanta pinga
Eso es lo que pasa cuando uno da la mano
Y quieren el brazo entero
Ha-ha

[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Wiz khalifa man

(How gangstas party)
How gangstas party
(How gangstas party)

[Intro]
Baby you understand me now
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
As soon as the beat drop
Within two bars, you already said I'm hot
They savor, my fruits of labor
My flow is sweeter than strawberries, oranges, and apricots
God-dammit I raised the standards of the status-quo
To go against me you gotta be more than professional
You got to go extra hard like an erection with no protection
And I be fucking all these bars
We be sexing I'm a nympho
For the instrumentals, all right, I admit it
Matter of fact I got a hot date tonight, real rap
Take this and take that from the machine
Got this money up, with no caffeine
Prepare me is Kerosene struck by a bunch of lightening
You looking at me then your sight seeing
And what that means is that this human being is fly, don't try to duplicate
I'm authentic, I see you scoping my style like forensics, that is foul
Tech! Leave 'em by the benches

[Hook]
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I see the future better than your computers
Apple software got the next 10 years scared I'm Fred Krueger
Rugers on my hip, terminate all intruders
Leave them dead inside the sewers
Shoulda' coulda' knew I was a murderer
Burning up the very sun, the rapture
The god is back, they said he'd come, but I came faster
I'm not an actor, if you play Denzel, you'll be thrown through a windshield
The nine merely is handheld, the AK is hands on
Now the battlefield I can land on one thousand mines and don't blow up because I'm the bomb
Inside your CD deck, duck for cover, guard your neck, I demand respect
If I never see a check, at least I got these rap niggas in check
Preach Tabernacle fetch the holy bible if I'm lying
King of my jungle, swear to remain humble, keep my vision tunnel
Because I don't need to get sidetracked, my producer name is Soundwave and he gives me beats by the batch

[Hook]
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
My flow cold, like Aspen
I love to show off when I'm in that Aston
Look I act a ass, but I'm not jack
A east side nigga I can get you popped at
A hundred rounds nigga stop that
You can't make that ass sit or flip-flop back
I'm too gutta nigga top that
This is lyrical homicide, not rap
So don't get it misunderstood
Say my name on your bars, shit I'm in your hood
With 45 goons 45 shugs
Chase your ass upstairs throw you of your roof
I see you big dogs, all I hear is woof
Loud talk, no bite, you niggas is puss
I'm off that bubble kush, thinking about life
Or how to make a mill and spend it all in one night
I just might...

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
...Snatch your bitch if she got a great appetite
For the top dog catalog, that means everybody
Several bodies on the shoty don't make it eight rappers
Damn I hate rappers, don't call me that
If you called it how you seen it you would call me real rap
I don't fabricate shit, all I do is keep it real
Eat, sleep, and take shits wipe me down if you will
Hold up, big truck, lurkin' with the monster grill
Four fifteens I got beat like Emmett Till
Put me in my g-mode schooling every hot-head
Tell them about the g-code, like eskimos
My arms froze, popsicle
Observing the game, I'm so official

[Intro]
Saw you for you
(Remember, remember, remember, remember)
You changed my life in so many ways  (would you remember, remember, remember, remember)
I just think back to  (would you remember, remember, remember, remember)
How I used to be and how you dealt with me (would you remember, remember, remember, remember)
Just want to thank you

[Verse 1]
Just in case I never see your face again
Just in case the worst was meant to happen
Just in case tomorrow never come, there is something you should know (should know)
I've given you every bit of the man I am (the man I am)
I know at times, it wasn't pretty, but it was all I had
I never held back, not one little bit, and the world can attest to this
And baby, you flipped my program upside down (upside down)

[Chorus]
(Listen to me now)
I was a hustler and player, girl (before I met you)
I'd drink a little something, then hit a little something (before I met you)
But how you made a (difference), look what I've been (missing)
You got my life (together) and I thank you (forever)
I really used to throw a lot (before I met you)
But I do one every night and sometimes I had two
But all of that done changed, my game, my frame of mind, you got it right
And I love you for life, girl, I love you for life

[Verse 2]
There was so many times I wasn't there for you
And for everyone of those times, I hated myself for
The way I went about it, the ups and the downs
One foot in, while the other foot's out
Loving on you, loving on another
But I ain't no different from any other brother
So what I give to you right here, right now
In this here place (is my voice, say it out)
In this here space (let my heart pour out)
As I state my case, as I break it down
To tell you where I'm coming from so you've seen the good you've done
So you've feel the change you've made, stay with me every day

[Chorus]
I was a hustler and player, girl (before I met you)
I'd drink a little something, then hit a little something (before I met you)
But how you made a (difference), look what I've been (missing)
You got my life (together) and I thank you (forever)
I really used to throw a lot (before I met you)
But I do one every night and sometimes I had two
But all of that done changed, my game, my frame of mind, you got it right
And I love you for life, girl, I love you for life

[Bridge]
Girl, if I died tonight before I wake
Know that you touched my life in oh so many ways
And sugar, if this song is I had to give, would you remember?
Remember my heart, remember it was good
Remember that I tried as long as I could
Remember that I gave 'til I had nothing else
Remember my voice

[Chorus]
I was a hustler and player, girl (before I met you)
I'd drink a little something, then hit a little something (before I met you)
But how you made a (difference), look what I've been (missing)
You got my life (together) and I thank you (forever)
I really used to throw a lot (before I met you)
But I do one every night and sometimes I had two
But all of that done changed, my game, my frame of mind, you got it right
And I love you for life, girl, I love you for life

[Outro]
Remember, remember, remember, remember
Would you remember, remember, remember, remember
Would you remember, remember, remember, remember
Would you remember, remember, remember, remember
Remember, remember, remember, remember
Would you remember, remember, remember, remember
Would you remember, remember, remember, remember
Would you remember, remember, remember, remember

[Intro: Chester Bennington]
Your lies!

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah!
I didn't think that I had a debt to pay
'Til they came to take all I had left away
You said you wouldn't put me to the test today
But I remember you saying that yesterday
There was a time when your mind wasn't out of control
Every memory and confession pouring out of your soul
Like a pill you couldn't swallow and it swallowed you whole
Another lie hard to follow 'til it followed you home
And like that

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Broken down
A victim of your lies

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You hide behind lies
You don't know why
You crossed the line
Wrapped up inside your lies
You hide behind lies
You're lost inside that cold disguise
Behind your lies

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I don't know what you thought I might say
Seems like we never would talk the right way
Every other minute I fought for my place
And drop what I made thought and you might stay so
I'm guessing that you probably know
When your inside's hollow then you ought to be cold
Like a pill I couldn't swallow and it swallowed me whole
Another lie hard to follow 'til it followed me home
And like that

[Pre-Chorus: Chester]
Broken down
A victim of your lies

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You hide behind lies
You don't know why
You crossed the line
Wrapped up inside your lies
You hide behind lies
You're lost inside that cold disguise
Behind your lies

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
You're faking, you're mistaken
If you think that you could climb out of this hole
Forsaken, what we take when
All our lies come from the power of control

[Pre-Chorus: Chester]
Broken down
A victim of your lies

[Interlude: Chester & Mike]
You hide behind lies
You don't know why
You hide behind lies
You don't know why
You hide behind lies
You don't know why
You hide behind
Wrapped up inside your lies

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
You hide behind lies
You don't know why
You crossed the line
Wrapped up inside your lies
You hide behind lies
You're lost inside that cold disguise
Behind your lies

[Intro: Lloyd]
Young Lloyd
Aye Holiday we got one
Zone 6, East Atlanta stand up
Aye baby you know how much this motherfuckin car cost?
Don't spill nothing in my shit

[Chorus: Lloyd]
I ain't makin' this shit up, ho I ain't Maybeline
I got some shit off in my cup that's gonna make ya lean

Cause I'm a fool with it, this is every day for me
She want that fly shit (fly shit, fly shit)
Expensive clothes and diamonds (diamonds, diamonds)
Just remember you in my shit (my shit my shit)
If you don't like the rules then bye bitch (bye bitch, bye bitch)

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Higher than a pilot, fresher than a stylist
You a bad bitch, I'm a take you to a island
Aggressive watch game, yeah my diamonds real violent
If you a grown lady then why you actin all childish?
Bought a new Bentley, I don't even gotta drive it
Parked outside so I jumped inside it
Lights frog-eyed'd, the seats cow hide'd
Private jet flying, smoking kush with the pilot
Head so good that it keeps me smiling
Forgiato rims so I keep on sliding
So icey boss so I keep on diamonds
And Too Short told me to keep on rhyming
2 Pac taught me to keep on riding
Biggie Smalls says yo mama be cryin
Owe me money and you keep on lyin
I'm a grab my gun, I'm a keep on firin
Ball so hard I can touch the sky
I can't even lie, I don't wear levi's
Goon came in and you took up yo chain
Fuck them niggas I'm a keep on mine
Your girl so fly and she gonna on wine
I ain't gonna tell you, nigga one time
Slide in with me, you can come in free
Or you can stand and freeze in that long ass line

[Chorus: Lloyd]
I ain't makin' this shit up, ho I ain't Maybeline
I got some shit off in my cup that's gonna make ya lean
I told er cool it, please don't make a scene
Cause I'm a fool with it, this is every day for me
She want that fly shit (fly shit, fly shit)
Expensive clothes and diamonds (diamonds, diamonds)
Just remember you in my shit (my shit my shit)
If you don't like the rules then bye bitch (bye bitch, bye bitch)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Riding down to crest and the Bentley Mulsanne
Little hand choppa and the big weed bong
Born by myself, I don't need no one
If you don't got no enemies, make you some
Sometime money can make you dumb
Money on yo head, better get yo gun
Broke ass nigga can't even make bond
I don't trust that bitch, money make er cum
Flyin to the nigga, tryna go to the prom
Smokin on kush like fuck my lungs
None of these hoes can't meet my mom
At the end of the day you want a suck her son
Leather jacket on so I feel like Fonzi
I ain't never ever had so much fun
500$ gun and a million on jewels
And I wet yo ass up like you jumped in the pool
Feds wanna get me just like Ja Rule
Five bad bitches, that's deja-vu
Wutchu gonna do with them scraps on you?
And kicks so fly, got a birds eye view
Gucci 2 times, 2 times times 2
All this money can't fit in these Tru's
This a T neck so my neck hurt too
But I pity the fool tryna try my crew

[Chorus: Lloyd]
I ain't makin' this shit up, ho I ain't Maybeline
I got some shit off in my cup that's gonna make ya lean
I told er cool it, please don't make a scene
Cause I'm a fool with it, this is every day for me
She want that fly shit (fly shit, fly shit)
Expensive clothes and diamonds (diamonds, diamonds)
Just remember you in my shit (my shit my shit)
If you don't like the rules then bye bitch (bye bitch, bye bitch)

[Chorus]
Stars are never sleeping
Dead ones and the living

[Verse 1]
We live closer to the earth
Never to the heavens
The stars are never far away
The stars are out tonight
They watch us from behind their shades
Brigitte Jack and Kate and Brad
From behind their tinted window stretch
Gleaming like blackened sunshine

[Chorus]
Stars are never sleeping
Dead ones and the living

[Verse 2]
Waiting for the first move
Satyrs and their child wives
Waiting for the last move
Soaking up our primitive world

[Chorus]
Stars are never sleeping
Dead ones and the living

[Verse 3]
Their jealousy's spilling down
The stars must stick together
We will never be rid of these stars
But I hope they live forever

[Bridge]
And they know just we do
That we toss and turn at night
They're waiting to make their moves
But the stars are out tonight

[Verse 4]
Here they are upon the stairs
Sexless and unaroused
They are stars, they're dying for you
But I hope they live forever
They burn you with their radiant smiles
Trap you with their beautiful eyes
They're broke and shamed or drunk or scared
But I hope they live forever
Their jealousy's spilling down
The stars must stick together
We will never be rid of these stars
But I hope they live forever

[Outro]
And they know just what we do
That we toss and turn at night
They're waiting to make their moves on us
But the stars are out tonight
The stars are out tonight
The stars are out tonight

[Intro: DJ Khaled]
It's so incredible
Yeah it's the DJ Khaled Khaled Khaled

I got the mothafuckin gutta on this track
I got the projects on this one!

[Chorus: Rock City]
You have no idea why you started

And boy we don't care who you calling
Nothing can save you know
Shotta youts will run up in your apartment
So you betta mind where you walking
God damn man can to your target

[Verse 1: Bun B]
See you dun push the wrong button
And Cross the wrong line
Stepped on the wrong shoe
Muthafucka it was mine
Time and time they get me out the tandem

For caveman king
You don't wanna fuck with the Southside Gotcha boys
Ya'll ain't know trill ass niggas

And pull shots on boys
Scattered like a roach
And put that on the fifth
I'm the nigga you don't wanna approach

[Verse 2: Blood Raw]
I was raised in the heart of the jungle
The belly of the beast
And this lick here sweet
I'm so flawed
You can put me on the front line
Ass back nicks
I don't represent the gun shy
Thing about the Street life
Homie I live
Wear my heart on my sleeve
And niggas gotta fear life
From the bottom to the top
East to the west
All I gotta say is Khaled
Nigga we the Best

[Chorus: Rock City]

And boy we don't care who you calling

For all the Evel Knievel people
Who try to stunt

Shoot you people while you sleeping
The grim reaper is out to lunch
Put holes in you mouth so you can't be found
And Khaled got my back
He gon shoot a hundred rounds
Bdddddddddddddah
So say hello to death
If you ever in my town

[Verse 4: Brisco]
I came from the eggs of a goddess
And the balls of a gigolo
All I had was 2 ounces
An old chevy and figuro
Blood shed apart my feet
And bad vibes got a nigga rocking voodoo deep
Lord forgive me I know not a better way
And pop has tried to stick me
Damn I need some better ye
Ring the Alarm
Tell em people come come
Look at what the fuck the Briscgun YEAH!
It's the Final Warning!

[Verse 5: Bali]
Khaled these niggas talkin

And leave a hole in his head
Like a dolphin
Fuck a hole in one
Ain't golfin'

Cause any nigga fuck wit my pocket
I'mma open his ass off
Like suicide doors
Any badass niggas
Y'all scared of that lake
I'mma tell you once don't be scared of the dre

[Chorus: Rock City]
You have no idea why you started
But guess this is your final warning
And boy we don't care who your callin
Nothing can save you know

[Verse 6: Lil Scrappy]
I'm usually cool
But know I gotta bet back

Tell em go hammer that
And it ain't gon take all day
We know where you live at
I'll bet ya hide from ya neighbors
Keep em mad shawty

Holla Khaled
And tell him I'm on the way now
I just had to hit a lick in the A-Town

[Verse 7: Shawty Lo]
Look at me it's shawty

Ya See what's Haapning

[Chorus: Rock City]
You have no idea why you started
But guess this is your final warning
And boy we don't care who your callin

So you betta mind where you walkin
God damn man can do your target
Nothin can save you know

[Hook]
Who's that lady? Who's that lady?
Beautiful lady, who's that lady?
Lovely lady, who's that lady?
Real fine lady, who's that lady?

Beautiful lady, who's that lady?

Red sauce on his shirt bowl of raviolli
Im making that cheese bowl of maccarroni
Ima make you my new tendaronni

[Left Brain]
Creep into your crib ill kill ya daughter and your son
Then I hit you up with a fucking water gun
With the odd future water gun its on the shirt

Hold up hold up.... bring it back

[Tyler, the Creator]

Niggas think the ak shit dont split

[Domo Genesis]

[Tyler, the Creator]

Bleed like a maxi pad

[Earl Sweatshirt]
Real nigga off top with it

Off top with the big men

[Intro: T.I.]
Yeah, yeah, no roof
Live life topless, can't nobody stop this

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ay, this the DR., in charge of saving artists out the ER
Bring them back to life, beats like CPR
Made the westside worldwide, no PR
Gangsta rap god, I'm the end all, be all
California love, from the Bloods to the C-Dogs
The Compton monsters make you wanna cut your MP off
The greatest in the game, haters should be ashamed
For not acknowledging the brain of the west coast king
Brought Chronic to the scene, folded pills in the lean
Now the game full of puppets, look at me: no strings
Again and again I've shown, you seen me
Piss on niggas' egos, ruin they self esteem
Sky the limit, no roof, I can do what you dream
Done it all 'fore you ever did a thing, knamean?
Tees and black jeans, no bling, just bang
Officially deranged, clinically insane
Look Eazy, ain't a damn thing changed, I promise
Still live like we did back with Straight Outta Compton
Taught niggas how to have attitudes on some hood shit
Showed them what to smoke when they were blazing that bullshit
That's why you smell the drug aroma when my record play
Not a blemish on my image, decorated resume
A legendary legacy
All that I was, you'll never be, fuck is y'all telling me?
Forever on top
Face it, you'll never be better than the Doc, ask Pac
Again, I say it's never gon' stop
Face it, you'll never be greater than the Doc, ask Pac

[Hook: Dr. Dre]
Guns blaze when I shine
Make a wish quick, no star and I'm the shooting kind
Front page all the time
You boys think sick, but I ain't got no roof on mine
(I dream topless, I live topless)
Like my girl is the game with her titties out
(I dream topless, I live topless)
Sky is the limit, I'm paid to run the city now

[Verse 2: Eminem]
My motto is live by the bottle, so why is my supply low?
Bring in a truckload with a high-low
Stay grounded, but I still reach for the sky, though
Ghetto idol, I think, but what do I know?
Shit, I know a lot more than I should
The hood stood by me just like I thought it would
Don't act like I'm Hollywood when I probably could
I don't polly, Muhammad Ali of rap, I don't lolly gag
West coast, the home of the body bag
The shotty, the mag, Los Angeles, where the party at?
You can catch me anywhere where there's Bacardi at
Yeah, Andre is back, so have a cardiac
Started back with the black, Raiders starter cap
Gangsta rap, we practically fucking started that
Everyday with this game I'm getting smarter at
Sky's the limit so every time I get on the track

[Hook]
Guns blaze when I shine
Make a wish quick, no star and I'm the shooting kind
Front page all the time
You boys think sick, but I ain't got no roof on mine
(I dream topless, I live topless)
Like my girl is the game with her titties out
(I dream topless, I live topless)
Sky is the limit, I'm paid to run the city now

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
1996, I left it all behind
'Cause I ain't got no roof on mine
I had to jump ship, I double back for my chips
My captain handle my shit
I've never been the losing kind
Grind, I feel it like it's year one
I'm a fool anywhere near square one
But ain't no glass ceilings, I crash through 'em
Ain't no coal spills, I light a match to 'em
Ain't no haters right, just say congrats to him
This is Detox, it's rehab to 'em
I bring it back years later, let it flow through 'em
Putting that Chronic in their systems like I used to do 'em
Respected so it's proven that's what I've been doing
Moving the game like weight and everybody been using
Bitch, it ain't really nothing left to say
You're tuned in to Detox, I am Dr. Dre

[Hook]
Guns blaze when I shine
Make a wish quick, no star and I'm the shooting kind
Front page all the time
You boys think sick, but I ain't got no roof on mine
(I dream topless, I live topless)
Like my girl is the game with her titties out
(I dream topless, I live topless)
Sky is the limit, I'm paid to run the city now

[Verse 3: Nas]
Your skin's your travelling bag of your existence
Yours is shabby and scab, while mine's glistenin'
Vivid on my skin, how many continents I visit then
You can journey with me to different places by listenin'
Shitting on them, your brother got it covered
We can slug it, knuckle it, however you want it, I love it
A hustler's wit, the grit, the grind
My genetic code make up, murderer by design
On Mayan calendar time, when night meets day
I'm in the light grey Bugatti like a high speed chase
Adrenaline like jogger, the jumping rope in place
Muhammed Ali hobbies, no Pilates, try'na keep the ocean by me
Hit a rich man's wife, see what these hoes can buy me
Looking forward, but it's nice to see the road behind me
Hotel's a seven star, Baguette's glowing
Keep your lid, yet dawg, the private jet Boeing, topless

[Hook]

[Male Medic]
Mr. Mathers?
Mr. Mathers!
Mr. Mathers...
Mr. Mathers, can you hear my voice?
Okay, he's not responding
I'm gonna need an 18 gauge, left AC, right away

[Female Medic]
Uh, BP is 90 over palp, respiration's at eight
Okay, I'm tubing him

[Male Medic]
DMC, this is medic 41

[Voice over radio]
Medic 41, this is DMC base, MIC. I'm Betty, go ahead

[Female Medic]
He's cold, spike a bag and grab the backboard

[Male Medic]
Okay, got it; on three... one, two
Let's move
How y'all feelin' tonight? Thank y'all for coming out to this impromptu type important performance, let me just say that right quick. I love the energy in this city - this is one of my all-time towns y'all know I stay out here. But I came here for the creativity more than anything, because creativity fuels everything

I hate business people. People get on the phone with me and tell me ya know like, 'What kind of business can you do, though? What type of business are you doing? What's the numbers? How much did you sell? What's the radio spins? How much shampoo can you sell with your face on it and shit?

Remind me again why we in this shit
Can you remind me again why we in this shit?

Remind me again why we in this shit (3x)
I know it's for more than to just get rich
Since when was making music about getting rich?
Since when was making art about getting rich?
And I know it's easy for me to say cause
Having money's not anything and not having it is

Remind me again why we in this shit
Remind me again why the Grammys couldn't suck my dick

Remind me again who's the original Superfly -
And I got love for Hov but I ain't fuckin' with that "Suit and Tie."

Remind me again
Remind me again why we in this shit -
Every nigga tryin' get rich
Every rapper tryin' get rich
And every rapper rap about fuckin' somebody else... bitch
Remind me why we in this shit -
And why the Grammys can suck my dick, suck my big, black dick

And every motherfuckin' sponsor, shit
They try to put their logos all over the concerts and shit
For a meet-and-greet, and you gotta meet the execs and their daughter
And they'll show you what they just bought her

Remind again why we in this shit -
Real niggas don't live too long in this shit. (x5)
They say either you comin' on too strong in this shit -
They always talkin' 'bout what I'm doing wrong in this shit
Well I COULD GIVE A FUCK ABOUT ANYTHING, DICK
I COULD GIVE A FUCK ABOUT ANYTHING DICK!
Remind me why we in this shit -
I lost my motherfuckin' mama
So I could give a fuck about your comments
I promise
Cause we all gonna die one day
BUT I'MMA LIVE MY LIFE MY WAY!

Remind me why we in this shit? Please? can I sell a drink for you please?
So you can help me put on a better show, Please? Corporations?
Can you please support me? I swear I'm a nice nigga now. I swear I'll put the pink polo back on. I swear to you. Please. Just for three million dollars. I need it so bad. I need a new pool in my back yard. So I tell all my fans that your shit is cool. And if they believe in me they should also believe in you. Did you get the check yet? I have to call a business manager - did the corporations send the check yet? What's my public rating right now? Are people liking me again? Enough to get money from the corporations - is it OK now? They forgot about the whole Beyonce thing right? Okay cool. Is it OK now?

Remind me why we in this shit -
Nigga I'mma make my music from my heart, and I live and I die by
Everything that I say and everything that I do
And everything that I make is what I believe to be true
And if that shit don't make sense and sound like nonsense
I don't give a fuck - cause that was my stream of conscience
And that's the way I felt at that time
And feelings was the only facts
And Racism and materialism is killing blacks
And one more thing, if I can ask -
One more thing if I can ask -
Cause in this life our life just moves too fast
And time is something you will never get back
What's your quality of life?
What's your quality of life?
And that's why I mean it when I say I hope you have a good time tonight
I hope you have a good time tonight...

LONDON! It's Louise Wilson's birthday tonight - an inspiration, not the lead instrument I'm the lead instrument. Happy birthday to Louise who taught Alexander McQueen... and Kanye West, even though she doesn't want me to put that on my resume. But I just feel sometimes like there is no good ideas and no real ideas and nothing sincere left. And everything's been so homogenized. And it's all Big Business, and there's no creativity. When really we have the ability to have a union Utopia if we just help each other, if we just use our resources and stop trying to compete against each other and
Beat each other and
Eat each other
And maybe come together and try to teach each other and
Reach each other and
Maybe try to come together and love each other
Love each other and
Love one another, man
The way you love your mother, man
The way you should love her, man
Y'already understand
Cause this is our shit
And this is our clique
Ain't nobody fresher than my motherfuckin' clique
I said ain't nobody fresher than MY MOTHERFUCKIN' CLIQUE!
Nobody feels like a G feels
When he post up his '64 on three wheels
Daddy ask me "what you wanna be when you grow up?"
A low rider with some Colt 45 in my cup

I was on my way to college and then saw
A Cadillac three-wheeling down Crenshaw
It was nineteen hundred and eighty three
I knew exactly what the fuck I wanted to be
A low rider, bass provider, drop down like a spider
Spy the hood rat and go straight inside her

But if she buttless
...bitch can't ride in my Cutlass

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Running them red lights sideways
In the parks and streets, brothers keep dying
But I drop the back and let the sparks keep flying
My daddy wanted me to take the Daytons off the Dodge
Cause the 'baseheads keep breaking in the garage
I keep sagging in my 'lac with my butt out, I strut out
Look at my two front tires, you know I cut out
I took from the ghetto what I could take
But you can't take my P.O with the metal flake
I'm a knucklehead buzzing off of alcohol
Messing up a new car for no reason at all

[Hook]
Hit the switch homeboy, Hit the swiotch
Stop acting like a little old biotch

[X2]
Front and back homeboy front and back
Blaze the sac and pass back my yack

[X2]
Three wheels homeboy, three wheels
Let me see your low rider G skills

[X2]
One switch, two switch, three switch, four
Oh my God, my battery's low!

[X2]

Cali, Cali swangin'
Sound, system bangin'

[X2]

Can't stop sporting them all-stars
Can't stop driving them gangster cars
New cars just don't appeal to me
It's 2004 and I'm a still a G
Cops don't want brothers loiterin'
Gangbangers drive by and start slaughterin'
So they talk a lot of smack and write a fat ticket
But I drive around the corner, come back and still kick it
Gotta sell wheatgerm and crack, so
I can have money just in case I break a axle
I turn my music up loud to attract a crowd
Throw the hood out the window, make the homeboys proud
Keep my kahkis creased right with my girl in my ride
I used to be local but now I'm worldwide
Afromanmusic dot com blowing up like Vietnam

[Hook]

Af-ro-man-make the Cadillac coupe pan-cake
Lock it up, cock it up
Post on threes, twist on Ds
Afro as you ride her, Cadillac walk like a spider
Smash out fast then dump her, sparks straight flying from the bumper
World. Wide. Hungry. Hustler, hit that switch don't be no buster
Hop in the coupe like a toad frog, go swoop up your role dog
Cali Swangin' K.J., Go way back like heyday
Six stray, six 'fo
A. F. R. O

[Hook]

[Chorus]
Well, I hear my train a comin'
Hear my
Hear my train a comin'

[Interlude]
Ayy ayy ayy yeah-eah

[Verse]
Well, I
Wait around the train station
Waitin' for that train
Take me, take me
Take me away
From this
Lonesome town
Lonesome town
Too bad you don't love me no more, girl
Too bad your people put me down
Hey, hey, hey

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Tears burnin' me
Tears burnin' me in my eyes
Way down
Way down in my soul
Tears burnin' me way down in my heart
Yeah
Too bad you don't love me no more, girl
Too bad you and me had to part
Had to part

[Chorus]
Well, I hear my train a comin'
Hear my train a comin'
Hear my train a comin'
Hear my train a comin'

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Well, I hear my train a comin'
Hear my train a comin'

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
You would never know
If you could ever be
If you never try
You would never see
Stayed in Africa
We ain't never leave
So there were no slaves in our history
Were no slave ships, were no misery, call me crazy, or isn't he
See I fell asleep and I had a dream, it was all black everything

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Uh, and we ain't get exploited
White man ain't feared so he did not destroy it
We ain't work for free, see they had to employ it
Built it up together so we equally appointed
First 400 years, see we actually enjoyed it
Constitution written by the W.E.B. Du Bois
Were no reconstructions, Civil War got avoided
Little black Sambo grows up to be a lawyer
Extra extra on the news stands
Black woman voted head of Ku Klux Klan
Malcolm Little dies as a old man
Martin Luther King read the eulogy for him
Followed by Bill O'Reilly who read from the Quran
President Bush sends condolences from Iran
Where FOX News reports live
That Ahmadinejad wins Mandela peace prize

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Martin luther had a dream got a movie in my head and it's
So repetative so I think that it's time to tell em it
Who's ahead of it bun b would be the president
Cause all us texas boys id do it bigger than they ever did
Not so competitive nobody would be your nemesis
Ain't no devilish sinners doing what the devil did
A muslim sits at a coffee table with the methadist
Listen to method man talking tell em what the method is
Can do it effordless he would be who your professor is
Mr ice cubes who we use to watch the defacites
Just a brief case wouldn't have ta wear a vest with it
Saving in your cheque and bank account wouldn't be so decilate
And what's a pessimist every person would be gettin chips
Wayne and sean carter would be 2 people you would never diss
To make a living strippers wouldn't have to show there nakedness
They would make 6 figures just to serve a plate of beverages
Lil kim in the lab mixin like a chemist did
Nicki minaj she the potion tell her that she messed with it
No fighting with a record label to get levarage
Gucci mane would be the c.e.o and talk with eliquence
Just like elephants everybodies pockets hella thick
Koopa wonders this but for now well say it's tenative
Reality shows stars always show intelligence
And nobody would have to beef because we all be gettin rich
I know this this type of dream seems like a stretch
But everyone of us would be the best
With plenty of money
Yea everyone of us would see the change
And we would never have to worry bout dealing with stress
Cause really none of us would be depressed
We would do what we wanted
Ya couldn't tell me that that wouldn't be freshhhh

[Hook:]

[Lupe Fiasco:]
Uh, and I know it's just a fantasy I cordially invite you to
Ask why can't it be?
Now we can do nothing bout the past
But we can do something about the future that we have
We can make fast or we can make it last
Every woman Queenin' and every man a Kingin'
When those color lines come we can't see between
We just close our eyes 'til it's all black every-THING

[Hook]

[Intro]
Hello Americans
My name is George Bush, and I'm going to do a rap for ya'll
Check it out

[Verse 1]
Bitch I'm from Texas
We're homophobic and sexist
And if these Mexicans keep coming in I'm 'a dismember 'em
You don't see me in El Paso, selling their tacos
Shit in my el baño, I'll cut off your asshole
Goddamn it, don't even talk about the faggots
If I ever seen one singing the national anthem I'ma strangle 'em
Hell nah, they can't get married, but they can fight in the military
Hopefully they'll end up buried in a cemetery
I don't even consider 'em people
Go ahead put 'em in the front lines
Next to the Negroes
But I'm not racist
Colin Powell's like my brother, alright I admit it I hate him
Where's Dick Cheney at? Probably off in Iraq
Finding some oil to tap, tell 'em I got up on that
And y'all still think it was Bin Laden
When it was us and the Masons, plotting on oil profits

[Chorus]
I'm evil
But y'all didn't know though
Now y'all stuck with a president that y'all didn't vote fo'
Unemployment is up, the economy's in a ditch
Our country's at war, but I don't give a shit, I'm rich
I'm evil
But y'all didn't know though
Now y'all stuck with a president that y'all didn't vote fo'
Unemployment is up, the economy's in a ditch
Our country's at war, but I don't give a shit, I'm rich

[Verse 2]
My brother said some racist shit a couple of years back
Then the blacks came out and started to protest and crap
And I knew I'd have little hope, cause all of sudden
The blacks got together and started to register to vote
But thank God for computers and them helping
Cause we got the last names of every single felon
We programmed the computers to find the names that were the same
Whoever came up couldn't vote on election day
Way to go Jeb, really great strategy
We got rid of the majority of black families
And I'm not even talking about Dade County
The expired military ballots are bogus, counted
I'd like to thank my cousin and the help from my pappy
My cousin owns Fox and it made me very happy
He told the entire world that I won
Before the votes were being done counted
And even though Gore had more, what matters in the end
Is the Supreme Court, and those are my dad's friends
So thank you very much, and please remember
If you don't vote, I'll see you back in November

[Chorus]
I'm evil
But y'all didn't know though
Now y'all stuck with a president that y'all didn't vote fo'
Unemployment is up, the economy's in a ditch
Our country's at war, but I don't give a shit, I'm rich
I'm evil
But y'all didn't know though
Now y'all stuck with a president that y'all didn't vote fo'
Unemployment is up, the economy's in a ditch
Our country's at war, but I don't give a shit, I'm rich

[Verse 1]
Something like tobacco road
Living on a lonely road
I will pull you out of there
We will go to Finchley fair

[Verse 2]
I will buy you feather hat
I will steal a cricket bat
Smash some windows, make a noise
We will run with dirty boys

[Chorus]
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down and the die is cast
When the die is cast and you have no choice
We will run with dirty boys

[Verse 3]
We all gone mad
We all want you
Vinny and the boys, we all go through
You got to learn to hold your tongue
This ain't the moon this is burnin' sun

[Chorus]
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down and the die is cast
When the die is cast and you have no choice
We will run with dirty boys

[Verse 1]
It's the darkest hour, you're 22
The voice of youth, the hour of dread
The darkest hour, and your voice is new
Love is lost, lost is love

[Verse 2]
Your country's new, your friends are new
Your house and even your eyes are new
Your maid is new and your accent, too
But your fear is as old as the world

[Chorus]
Say goodbye to the thrills of life
When love was good, no love was bad
Wave goodbye to the life without pain
Say hello, you're a beautiful girl

[Verse 3]
Say hello to the lunatic men
Tell them your secrets, they're like the grave
Oh, what have you done? Oh, what have you done?
Love is lost, lost is love
You know so much, it’s making you cry
You refuse to talk, but you think like mad
You've cut out your soul and the face of thought
Oh, what have you done? Oh, what have you done?

Oh, what have you done? Oh, what have you done?

[Verse 1]
Valentine told me who's to go
Feelings he's treasured most of all
The teachers and the football star

[Chorus]
It's in his tiny face
It's in his scrawny hand
Valentine told me so
He's got something to say, it's Valentine's Day
The rhythm of the crowd
Teddy and Judy down
Valentine sees it all
He's got something to say, it's Valentine's Day

[Verse 2]
Valentine told me how it feels
If all the world were under his heels
Or stumbling through the mall

[Chorus]
It's in his tiny face
It's in his scrawny hand
Valentine knows it all
He's got something to say, it's Valentine's Day

[Outro]
(Yeah)
Valentine Valentine
(Yeah) (Woo) (Woo)
Valentine Valentine
It's in his scrawny hand
It's in his icy heart
It's happening today
Valentine Valentine
It's in his scrawny hands
It's in his icy heart
It's happening today
Valentine Valentine
If you can see me I can see you

I could wear your new blue shoes
I should wear your old red dress
And walk to the crossroad, so take this knife
And meet me across the river

Just chutes and ladders
And this is the kiss
American anna fantasticalsation
From nowhere to nothing
And neither way back

Children swarm like thousands of bugs
Towards the light
The beacons above the hill
The stars to the West, the South, the North
And to the East

Now you can say I've got a gift of sorts
A fear of rear windows and swinging doors
My love of violence and tenants' sighs
If you can see me I can see you
If you can see me I can see you
I have seen these bairns wave their fists at God
Swear to destroy the beast, stamping the ground
In their excitement for tomorrow

I could wear your new blue shoes
I should wear your old red dress
And walk to the crossroad, so take this knife
And meet me across the river

I will take your lands and all that lays beneath
The dust of cold flowers, drizzle of dark ashes
I will slaughter your kind, descend from belief
I am the spirit of greed, the lord of theft
Burn all your books and the problems they make
If you can see me I can see you
If you can see me

[Intro: Nickelus F]
Out tryna to get this paper

[Chorus: Nickelus F]
We in hoodies and timbs
Out on the grind
Rain or shine
Nickels and dimes
I'm out tryna to get his paper

[Verse 1: Nickelus F]
I wake up, got money on mind
And I can't get off so I got to get on my grind
Got to get all my ducks in line
My bills in order crackers taking orders
For niggas in the race I got water
For niggas with hate I got llamas
Tissues for they mama
I'm flyer than Aladdin on a carpet
Saw A Whole New World when I made my profits
And my jasmine is a rapping
I do it the best, These niggas ain't smashing
Raw dog action
I impregenate the beat everytime I speak
A seed of my speech concives and MC! (Ho!)
Similar to me( yes),so we ain't' got to write just think
Keep it in the head like T
Spit listerine on the beat
Flossin' diamonds and me
Now peep the way I deliver on the beat
Is what you lack yeah that's why I'm so SWEET!
That's why yo chick want to pump me (right)
She want to be the chick from the other guy
Wanna be a lover I chuckle I laugh
As soon as you turn yo back I'm smashing
Hey I'm the other guy
Now you wanna rumble why
I mixed some limbs up make you a jambalaya
Wet you up
Roll you down the mountain and let your tumble drop
Throwback line for those who been listening (Uh!)
For all the new listeners that boy just filling
Niceklus is gifted nickename his Christmas

Cop yall CD at this point I bet yall get it
At this point forget it..
I'm like a preganat woman I deliver
Now pop it push it!

[Chorus: Nickelus F]
We in hoodies and timbs
Out on the grind
Rain or shine
Nickels and dimes
I'm out tryna to get his paper

[Verse 2: Drake]
(I gotta spill on this)
That's why I roll up and tend to get high
Cause my arms won't extend to the sky
Peer pressure always make me feel lesser than a 10 in they eyes
So I can only grab my pen and advise
Street legends and chicks seem to wonder
Exactly who I am
You know me if you had a job at 16 and under yup
It's Drake and Saint Nick
Take a whiff of this and faint quick
Off a sample of the flow patient
But I don't lie to rhymers
I strip walls and apply the primer
If there's a wall I'm gon' try to climb-aaa
Without a graded rope
Our navy seal Buddies yelling slurs at me
I'm always gon find another way to go
I'm minty fresh with the Green like I'm made a bathing scope
No bathing ape but I'm clean Like I'm made of soap
Begging for the fire
Buglars in hear we
We all good in the fam we like Meagan and limiya
I dress like Lou, I sell verses to label
And they give me the next joint
To sound less like you
That's something I had to say before
I'm real picky with real with lyrics
So don't use joints you probably would pay me for
I ain't' a heat busser
What up to Denik Rusha and Bei Major, Trey Songz, the street's Usher
Leak tracks and heat wax and he bust ya
And then sign ya
This is a reminder
This along the lines of Thrill is Gone still the song
I'mma mention Jay even though I feel it's wrong
We gave good ambition homegirl couldn't listen
Now she want the Snackpack back and her pudding's missin'
Bring the topic back
Please don't stop the track
Tropicana never got the hammer by my jock in-fact, I keep my money there
Mixtapes where I top em at
DJ Smallz.com you can shop at that
Speak of shopping I'm tryna get a label deal
Tryna live my dreams while awake, tryna make the fables real
No stealing cable trying to have my cable still
Better yet stolen, my grammar is golden
My grammer go harder than most rappers
There's a certain female rapper I will expose and
For once I think you should tell yo mouth to get to closing
No I didn't pen that Freestyle shit
I got a session with Digs so the beef I'm gone end that
Anybody else get the piece that I bend back
Let it marinate if you niggas dare to hate

[Verse 1]
Blue songs are like tattoos
You know I've been to sea before
Crown and anchor me
Or let me sail away

[Verse 2]
Hey, blue, there is a song for you
Ink on a pin
Underneath the skin
An empty space to fill in

[Chorus]
Well, there's so many sinking now
You gotta keep thinking
You can make it through these waves
Acid, booze, and ass
Needles, guns, and grass
Lots of laughs, lots of laughs

[Bridge]
Everybody's saying that
Hell's the hippest way to go
Well, I don't think so
But I'm gonna take a look around it, though
Blue, I love you

[Verse 3]
Blue, there is a shell for you
Inside you'll hear a sigh
A foggy lullaby
There is your song from me

[Sample]
I am the smartest man alive!

[Intro]
I tried to tell all my friends when I was a kid that I had powers
And nobody wanted to believe me
All right

[Bridge]
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm

[Verse 1]
Spent the last month feeling bad 'bout myself
I couldn't speak anything of real hope
And the day came when it hit me like lightning through my veins
A sudden change in my groove, in my walk
Hmmm, I got my lion heart and electric flowing through my brain
Shocking waves make me feel I can float
It's like the city is mine and the dark is my cape
I can't explain this sudden peace, am I woke? I sure hope

[Chorus]
I'm living my life as if I got powers
And tonight I feel immortal
I said, "Tonight I feel immortal," ohh
Tonight I feel immortal, woah

[Bridge]
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm

[Verse 2]
Bet you want to see me weak, not sort of my thing you see
I'm too damn cool, my mojo too dope
It's the same old thing getting lost day and night, young and lost in the pain
So many times I've broke this vicious cycle
Hmmm, I got my lion heart and electric flowing through my brain
Shocking waves make me feel I can float
Surely I'ma do what I want, ain't got no one to blame
I can't explain this sudden peace, am I woke? I sure hope

[Chorus]
I'm living my life as if I got powers
And tonight I feel immortal
I said tonight I feel immortal, ohh
Tonight I feel immortal, yeah

[Bridge]
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
I'm living my life as if I got powers
And tonight I feel immortal
I said tonight I feel immortal, ohh
Tonight I feel immortal, yeah-ah
Ohh, I, ohh

[Outro]
Don't Fuck with me. Fuck with me. Don't, don't fuck with me. Fuck with me

[Verse 1]
I don't believe in competition
Ain't nobody else like me around
I don't need your inquisition
It ain't that hard to figure it out

[Chorus]
Give it up now
Play it cool
Give it up now
Play it cool
All the rules that you use and abusing
No illusion can take this confusion
Give it up now
Don't let me down

[Verse 2]
Don't think too much of my disposition
You already know what's going down
Don't wanna be your exhibition, no
I don't want nobody hanging around

[Chorus]
Give it up now
Play it cool
Give it up now
Play it cool
All the rules that you use and abusing
No illusion can take this confusion
Give it up now
Don't let me down

Give it up now
Play it cool
Give it up, yeah
Play it cool
All the rules that you use and abusing
No illusion can take this confusion
Give it up now
Don't let me down

Play it cool
Play it cool
Play it cool
Play it cool

Give it up
Give it up
Give it up now
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Everyday nothing seems to change
Everywhere I go I keep seeing the same old things
And i, I can't take it no more
I would leave this town
But I ain't got no where else to go

Wake up in the morning to more, more bad news
Sometimes I feel like I was born to lose
And i, It's driving me out of my mind

Gonna catch the next train
And move on down the line

[Chorus]
I'll be ready
I'll be ready when my train pulls in
I'll be ready
I'll be ready when my train pulls in

I know my time ain't long
And i, I can't live this life again

[Verse 2]
Walking down the street you might run across a smiling face
But they'll stab you in the back as soon as you turn, walk away, And i
Oh Lord, it's bringing me down
If things don't change around here
Ain't no use in my hanging 'round

[Chorus]
I'll be ready
I'll be ready when my train pulls in
I'll be ready
I'll be ready when my train pulls in

I know my time ain't long
And i, I can't live this life again

[Verse 1]
When you're feeling down and out
When you're feeling black and blue
You should feel like you can come to me
And I'll tell you the truth

Yet somewhere we got twisted
How do we get lifted?
How did we not go insane?

For so long we've existed
Still we are resisted
Why is it we still remain?

[Chorus]
Black and blue, yeah
Black, black and blue
Oh no, don't leave me
Black and blue, yeah
Black, black and blue
Oh no, don't leave me

[Verse 2]
They say you get just what you paid for
And that you reap just what you sow
So, you won't get everything you pray for
Surprises me that you don't know, by now

I need something to hold on to
While the world is spinning 'round and 'round
It could crumble any moment
I keep my feet on solid ground, for now

[Chorus]
Black and blue, yeah
Black, black and blue
Oh no, don't leave me
Black and blue, yeah
Black, black and blue
Oh no, don't leave me

Black and blue, yeah
Black, black and blue
Oh no, don't leave me
Black and blue, yeah
Black, black and blue
Father, don't leave me

[Chorus]
Black and blue, yeah
Black, black and blue
No I won´t leave you
Black and blue, yeah

[Verse 1]
Woke up in New York City lying on the floor
Just outside of Marcy's - West 54
You're gonna know my name by the end of the night
You're gonna know my name by the end of the night

[Chorus]
Bright lights, big city going to my head
Bright lights, big city going to my head
Bright lights, big city going to my head
I don't care, cause you don't care

[Verse 2]
Start off with the bottle ended up with the bottle
Taking shots, waiting on tomorrow
Tryn' ta fill up what's hollow
You're gonna know my name
You're gonna know my name

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Got lost in the city tryna find myself
I went up a different person, came down somebody else
I know it ain't right, but it's all in my head
I'm surprised that I'm still alive, should be dead

[Hook]

[Chorus]
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh

[Verse 1]
Travis County took my picture
But no, I didn't smile
They told me I was gonna be here
For a pretty long while

One day I was walking down the street when
I should've been walking down the hall
Heard a voice calling out, saying
"Ooh, where you going, y'all?"

Now before I could've gathered my thoughts
I turned around and I saw the cops
I pointed arms up right when
He told me I better stop

[Verse 2]
They put my hands in cuffs
Oh boy, they even locked me up
When I thought that it was all a bluff
Till they started taking my stuff

Now I'm sittin' 'round in my cell
Just a looking at the wall
I didn't even get to make
My one phone call

After I was just sittin' 'round
You know I started getting down
When they let me out
All I could do is scream and shout

[Chorus]
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh

Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh

[Chorus]
I can't go on like this
Knowing that I'm just getting by
Can't go on like this
Knowing that I'm just getting high

[Verse 1]
Well, I wake up
Around ten in the morning
Feeling crazy, feeling 

[on it]
From the night before cause I was up
Till four in the morning plus some
So I take long trip
And then I take out my song scripts
When I sit down to write
I always look to God to help me see the light

But I know, that I ain't even livin' right
And I know, that I can't live by the night
But it's so hard for me just to put it down
So hard for me to pass up the crown
When it's been passed down
I'm sitting on the throne
Sometimes I feel in this world I've just been thrown
Not been showing it, and I don't know
When to slow it down

[Chorus]
I can't go on like this
Knowing that I'm just getting by
Can't go on like this
Knowing that I'm just getting high

But this is the life, life, life, life
The life
This is the life, life, the life, life, the life
This is the life, life, the life, life, the life
They tell me it's the life, life, the life, life, the life

[Verse 2]
Once again, I hit the hot spot with my so-called friends
Then I hit the ATM and then realize I ain't got no ends
Then I call up my kin, hey, my money going
I'm standing at the bar but the drinks quit flowing
Strap for gas sitting on the block
Drunk as hell tryna 'void the damn cops
And this is how it is sometimes when you fall off track
Like when your record's stretched and you try to run it back
But sometimes the stretch got to deep an impact
It makes it so hard for you not to look back
Regretting things you did in the past
I wake up in the morning tell myself it won't last
But I tend to get another glass, then I
Start to act just like an ass, then I

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
They told me that I needed some patience
But don't keep me waiting too long
They told me that I needed salvation
But who are we to lean on?

Something's going on here
Something's going wrong
Running out of time here
But I'm still waiting for something

It doesn't matter how high
As long as you're with me when we fall

[Pre-Chorus]
We're a step away from breaking down
I need something good

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, don't get me jumpin' for nothin'
Hey, hey, don't get me jumpin' for nothin'

[Verse 2]
The light is at the end of the tunnel
Or is it just a runaway train
My daddy told me, "Glitter ain't gold, young boy
So save yourself a whole lot of pain"

[Chorus]
Well, I'm numb
Yeah woman, I can't feel a thing
Well, I'm numb
Yeah woman, I can't feel a thing

[Verse 1]
She give me hard time in the day
A hard time at night
She can be so sweet till she wanna fuss and fight

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Ain't passing from the right
I'm passing to the left
Burn this whole thing down by myself

[Verse 1]
It might not be the right time
I might not be the right one
But there's something about us I want to say
'Cause there's something between us anyway

[Verse 2]
I might not be the right one
It might not be the right time
But there's something about us I've got to do
Some kind of secret I will share with you

[Refrain]
I need you more than anything in my life
I want you more than anything in my life
I'll miss you more than anyone in my life
I love you more than anyone in my life

[Verse 1]
Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

[Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like oooooh ooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize

[Chorus]
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

[Verse 2]
My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made (oh)
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like oooooh ooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize

[Chorus]
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

[Bridge]
Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

[Chorus]
I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man

[Outro]
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man

[Verse 1]
I've been a bad, bad girl
I've been careless with a delicate man
And it's a sad, sad world
When a girl will break a boy just because she can

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you tell me to deny it
I've done wrong and I want to suffer for my sins
I've come to you 'cause I need guidance to be true
And I just don't know where I can begin

[Chorus]
Ooh
What I need is a good defense
'Cause I'm feelin' like a criminal
And I need to be redeemed
To the one I've sinned against
Because he's all I ever knew of love

[Verse 2]
Heaven, help me for the way I am
Save me from these evil deeds before I get them done
I know tomorrow brings the consequence at hand
But I keep livin' this day like the next will never come

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, help me, but don't tell me to deny it
I've got to cleanse myself of all these lies 'til I'm good enough for him
I've got a lot to lose and I'm bettin' high, so I'm beggin' you
Before it ends just tell me where to begin

[Chorus]
What I need is a good defense
'Cause I'm feelin' like a criminal
And I need to be redeemed
To the one I've sinned against
Because he's all I ever knew of love

[Bridge]
Let me know the way
Before there's hell to pay
Give me room to lay the law and let me go
I've got to make a play
To make my lover stay
So, what would an angel say?
The devil wants to know

[Chorus]
What I need is a good defense
'Cause I'm feelin' like a criminal
And I need to be redeemed
To the one I've sinned against
Because he's all I ever knew of love
What I need is a good defense
'Cause I'm feelin' like a criminal
And I need to be redeemed
To the one I've sinned against
Because he's all I ever knew of love

[Verse 1]
My love is with you
Even though you're far away
You make me love you
And that's where my love will stay

Those times I get lonely
You're the one who truly knows me
I can tell it in the way you talk
You show me

[Chorus]
Why don't you please come home
Come on home, girl
You've been gone way too long
Come on home, girl

[Verse 2]
As time goes by
My days go by slower
My nights are getting colder
And my mind has gone astray
Why don't you please come home, oh
Come on home, girl
You've been gone way too long
Oh, come on home
Ooh, come home, girl
Oh, come on home, girl
Oh please come home, girl

[Chorus-Gary Clark Jr]
Oh baby, things are changing now
And I can't tell where I'll be from here on out
Ooh, it's hell
Knowing that from now
We shouldn't kiss and tell
It's so good

[Verse 1-Gary Clark Jr]
You walk up to me like a stranger, girl
And I already know your name
I can make you feel good if you want
Give me the time of day
Well, you listen to me here and now
I'll lay you down simple and plain
Won't it be good to get together, girl?
But it'll be so hard to maintain
Cause it seems like now...

[Chorus-Gary Clark Jr]
Oh baby, things are changing now
And I can't tell where I'll be from here on out
Ooh, it's hell
Knowing that from now
We shouldn't kiss and tell
It's so good

[Verse 2-Gary Clark Jr]
I told you already, girl
That I was so gone
But that sweet, sweet loving
It had me hanging on, so strung out
I know now, girl
That I can stand alone
I was put here on this earth by myself
I gotta keep moving on
Cause it seems like now...

[Verse 1]
It's taking me a little while to bounce back
I've been falling from something good
People say I took a little too long
Oh, I did, yeah

[Chorus]
Till you came along and you saved me
You saved me
With that good love

You came along and you saved me
You saved me
With that good love

[Verse 2]
It's taking me a little while to call back
I've been working on something good
So every now and then I tend to fall back
Oh Lord, I've been misunderstood

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You got it all, baby
I'm so addicted, I can't help but want it more
And more and more
You got it all, baby
I'm so addicted, I can't help but want it more
And more and more
Let's get drunk today
Let's get high tonight
Maybe in the morning
Things will be alright

I am living under
So much stress and strife
Sometimes I stop and wonder
How to enjoy my life

Hanging with my homies
Talking jive
Smoking marijuana, drinking Cult 45
Hey homeboy, let's get drunk today

Let's get drunk today
Let's get high tonight
Maybe in the morning
Things will be alright

I am living under
So much stress and strife
Sometimes I stop and wonder
How to enjoy my life
Bumping my music very loud
Limping down the sidewalk so high
Slap my brother, let's get drunk tonight

Let's get drunk today
Let's get high tonight
Maybe in the morning
Things will be alright

I am living under
So much stress and strife
Sometimes I stop and wonder
How to enjoy my life

Now I'm nice and tipsy
And I'm high-igh
Flirting with the ladies
Walking by-ie-ie
Hey pretty lady, let's hook up tonight

Let's get drunk today
Let's get high tonight
Maybe in the morning
Things will be alright

I am living under
So much stress and strife
Sometimes I stop and wonder
How to enjoy my life
Buckaa! (chicken sound :P)

[Hook 1]
You are
Face to Face now
Face to Face
You are
Face to Face now
With me
You are
Face to Face now
Face to Face
You are
Face to Face now
With me
You are
Dancing
You are
Dancing
You are
Face to Face now
Face to Face
You are
Face to Face now
With me

[Verse 1: Todd Edwards]
What's going on? Could this be my understanding?
It's not your fault I was being too demanding
I must admit, it's my pride that made me distant
All because I hoped that you'd be someone different

[Chorus 1: Todd Edwards]
There's not much I know about you
Fear will always make you blind
But the answer is in clear view
It's amazing what you'll find face to face

[Hook 2]
You are
Face to Face now
Face to Face
You are
Face to Face now
With me
You are
Face to Face now
Face to Face
You are
Face to Face now
With me

[Verse 2: Todd Edwards]
I turned away because I thought you were the problem
Tried to forget, until I hit the bottom
But when I faced you in my blank confusion
I realised you weren't wrong, it was a mere illusion

[Chorus 2: Todd Edwards]
It really didn't make sense
Just to leave this unresolved
It's not hard to go the distance
When you finally get involved face to face

[Hook 1]
You are
Face to Face now
Face to Face
You are
Face to Face now
With me
You are
Dancing
You are
Dancing
You are
Face to Face now
Face to Face
You are
Face to Face now
With me

[Chorus 2: Todd Edwards]
It really didn't make sense
Just to leave this unresolved
It's not hard to go the distance
When you finally get involved face to face

[Round 1: Eminem]
Aight, look! Any rapper saying those kind of rhymes
In this day and age, in this period of time
Tryin' to battle Eminem is worse than David Starr
Tryin' to battle Proof, Eye-Kyu, B-Fat and Bizarre

[…] That's why you beg to differ me
You ain't got no style, plus you lack delivery
Not to brag, I don't mean to boast
Look, my face is pale, but you look like you seen a ghost

[…]
You're that bitch, you couldn't slip into the zone
If I put banana peels around this fuckin' microphone
Go get a bull dozer, start from bottom to top
And tear this building down
‘Cause that's the only way you're wrecking shop
All I wanted was to borrow a few racks and a place to lay my head
But papa Douglas know he be tripping (Tripping)
He ain't wanted to have nothing to do with me
Ever since I dropped out of high school and started pimping (Pimping)
I'm blinging, oh I'm the meanest
My father thought I was a drug, the way I keep these hoes fiending
For me (Daddy you are)- Shh! Y'all shut the hell up, this my confession
Now what kind of father would put his son out on the streets?
Call me a pimp or thug, I'm still his bloods, how could he do this to me?
Church!

[Intro]

[Hook x2: Harmony]
Heal yourself, you got to heal yourself
Heal yourself, ooohhh

[Kid Capri talks]

[Verse 1: Big Daddy Kane]
Mama said don't do crack and smoke you know
Cause it will make your nose grow like Pinocchio
Since I was only 15 I had to listen
To what was said for my parent was a christian
I went to school and saw all my friends do it
But I said no cause I don't want my nose to grow
They started tripping on me, busting and flipping on me
So I had to front and say yo, true, stick it on me
I started smoking to prove I'm an adult
Now it's a habit but is it all my fault
I wished my mother would have told me the truth
Cause now I'm all based out, ma dukes

[Kid Capri]
Oh man I like the way that's going down
Now what I want you to do is kick a little Freddie Foxx

[Verse 2: Freddie Foxxx]
Everybody rise as I present to a jet black crowd
What it's like to be black and proud
In a world where white is right but not tonight
This is a black man's mic
I heard a sister say she don't like darker shades of black
On a man cause that's whack
But to my light skin sister can't you tell
You're just the surface of a dark deep well
And how can you prefer to be wit those
That sprayed you wit gun and hoses
And never put roses on the graves
Of the slaves that they treated like dirt
After all that hard work

[Kid Capri]
Clap your hands to the beat, C'mon, just clap your hands to the beat
Freak it now

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
One of the biggest lies you hear from no one else
Is when a girl tries to say she don't do it to herself
Always fantasizing but steadily denying
Last night she had to stop cause her baby was crying
She do it on the phone all alone wit a smile
Run the water, grab the shower cap and get buckwild
Soap suds on the floor, oh Al B Sure
Give it to me, give it to me, give me a little more
I'm fiending, creaming, screaming, dreaming (what else)
The girl's possessed by the basehead demon

[Hook: Harmony]

[Verse 4: MC Lyte]
In Elementary, Lyte had the Jordache look
Like me and any other kid who cared about books
But then I got wise and I begin to listen
To the whack teachers and the wick-wack system
My mother put me in Weusi Shule
Which means black school in Swahili
And there is where I learned black history
And how to be the best that I can be
I went back and now the school is closed
There is nowhere for black youth to go
To be taught by brothers and sisters who knows what it means
To be a black child or a white teen
In the end the youth is being mistreated
Which means the world is being cheated

[Verse 5: Queen Latifah]
Dane was never taught her life was worth something
But when people don't try to improve it makes me want to hurt something
You want to be somebody and be a standout
But got your handout, oh you're broke, I guess it's off to your man's house
Why is sister's giving up the bod
Today it seems not to father you too hard
They call us skeezers and you prove it to the worst
Hon, you have to earn the right to say it's ladies first

[Kid Capri]
Oh man this is Human Education Against Lies
You better know the flavor kid

[Verse 6: KRS-One]
Human Education Against Lies tries
To open the eyes of humanity before it dies
Black and white ain't the real fight
That's the only thing the media hypes
The real fight are these major corporations
Holding back on real education
Before you're a color, first you're human
Teaching humanity is what we're doing

[Kid Capri]
And just when you thought you knew everything there was to know
You didn't know anything about this, tell 'em Melodie

[Verse 7: Ms Melodie]
Daddy's home everyday since he lost his job
His new line of work is now beating up mom
Mom is scared, she doesn't know what to do
Her beautiful skin is now black and blue
She used to cry, now she's Packin' A Pan
A human war between woman and man

[Kid Capri]
Melodie, Kid Capri

[Verse 8: Jam Master Jay and DMC]
JMJ all the way, yo
Human Education Against Lies
To all the girls and to all the guys
Get paid, get it made
Get a good grade, live to a very old age
Check it out check, no disrespect
To each and every member of the opposite sexes
Yes, listen to the messages and I send some
We never knew where the poison came from
Yo, we're rapping on H.E.A.L. so we thought we like to mention
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
AIDS, we're here to make you get wise
Human Education Against Lies

[Kid Capri talks]

[Intro]
Uh...Alright
I'm on my way to OshFest

[Verse 1: Mike Posner]
Same Burn Rubber fitted from the first mixtape (Raise up)
Same best friends with me without close-up Jay
And they treat me the same as they always did
Still I'm not making beats in my dorm room shit (Alright)
I'm just a Hip-Hop kid I never really thought it would get this big (Okay, uh)
Couple dollars in my pocket just watch it
I bet that all the girls saying I'm cute (Whooo)
And no more Pa’ sitting with them and looking
And thinking that this could be my substitute (Uh)

[Hook]
But it’s the same shit, different day
Is it that I came up, I feel the same
I’m just tryin’ to live (Na, na, na, na)
Just tryin’ to live (Na, na, na, na)
I got a dime bag and a dime
She on my right arm, I feel alright
I’m just tryin’ to live (Na, na, na, na)
Just trying to live (Na, na, na, na)

[Verse 2: Blackbear]
Same shit, I’m on my own now
Still rocking, young and reckless
I changed my number from my hometown
But every time that they text it, they call me a saint
They always did, just moved to Hollywood, trying to write me a hit (Alright)
I’m just a punk rock kid
I never really thought I’d be on Posner and shit
I’m still the same, but I got some money on the side
But I bet that all the girls say that I’m fly
My crew is wildin, and I’m just smiling cause momma really paid her tithes

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mike Posner]
Babes, beats and basketball
That’s really all I ever do
Till I pick-up my suitcase
Another tour starts, I’m in a city near you
That’s babes, beats and basketball
That’s really all I ever do
Till I ṗick up my suitcase
Another tour starts, I’m in a city near you

[Hook]
But it’s the same shit, different day
Is it that I came up, I feel the same
I’m just tryin’ to live (Na, na, na, na)
Just tryin’ to live (Na, na, na, na)
I got a dime bag and a dime
She on my right arm, I feel alright
I’m just tryin’ to live (Na, na, na, na)
Just trying to live (Na, na, na, na)

[Outro]
Alright

[Verse 1]
I didn't question, I didn't know
As far as I'd seen, life was endless
When I realised I had to let go
We are mere mortals as to the rest

[Chorus 1]
It's not eternal, imperishable
While on the move
It's not eternal, interminable
Progress is the clue

[Verse 2]
I thought IBM was born with the world
The US flag would float forever
The cold opponent did pack away
The capital will have to follow

[Chorus 2]
It's not eternal, imperishable
Oh, yes, it will go
It's not eternal, interminable
The dinosaur law

[Chorus 2]
It's not eternal, imperishable
Oh, yes, it will go
It's not eternal, interminable
The dinosaur law

[Bridge]
Look at the symbols, they are alive
They move, evolve, and then they die
Michelle,

Is the ULTIMATE example of a truly strong
African American woman.

She is a caring mother, she's a loving wife,
while at the same time, she is the FIRST LADY!!!!

No matter the pressure, and stress of being
under the microscope - she is humble, loving and
sincere.

She builds and nurtures her family, while also
looking out for so many millions in so many ways

Michelle, thank you so much for every single
thing that u do for us - I am PROUD to have
my daughter grow up in a world where she has
people like you, to look upto.

Love
Beyoncé

[Intro]
Yeah man...Ursher baby

[Verse 1]
It's so crowded up in here what you doin' all alone
And It's so dark in here plus you ain't even got your phone
What kind of man would ever want to leave your side
Shame on him, you coming home with me tonight babe

[Hook]
Go missin’

Reckless abandon go ahead and card your girl

Girl to each his own
I promise if you come with me I’ll let you get home in the morning
Make up your mind girl what’s it going to be
Keep it mind we gotta leave before they turn the light on

[Hook]

Come with me shorty forget about him

So do yourself a favor tonight
Oh, girl lets go missin’

[Hook]

[Refrain]
Dem-dem-dem-free-freekdem
Dem-dem-dem-free-free-dem

[Verse 1]
I’m so tangy, people call me Mathangi
Goddess of word, bitches I’mma keep it banging
Truth is like a rotten tooth, you gotta spit it out!
Let the bottom two, let my wisdom work it out
Big on the underground, can’t knock me down
Vicki Leekx bitches, back by dope demand
I sleep on my talent and I stand by it too
I can say lots with a little words or few like
Like Adam had 'em, yeh, me, the madame
Yeah I’ll introduce you to the dooms do dooms
Come let we go, do you like my perfumes?
Made it at home with some gasoline and shrooms
Oil and water are two extremes
We like fucking carpets, you fucking brooms
Why is your tattoo some ugly looking thing?
I got many designs they're downloading on Bing
My cousin got his G.C.S.E.'s decorating
He’s handy you might need him when I finish what I’m saying
Let's be frank, you my stan, I'm your stan
I don’t care what you smoke, what you fucking drank
I'm allowed to be pissed at mates who are yanks
Cause it’s not me and you, it's the fucking banks!

[Hook]
Bring the noise when we run upon them!
Bring the noise when we run upon them!
Bring the noise when we run upon them!
Bring the noise when we run upon them!

[Refrain]
Dem-dem-dem-free-freekdem
Dem-dem-dem-free-free-dem

[Verse 2]
Truth is like a rotten tooth, you gotta spit it out
I left the bottom two, let my wisdom work it out
The world is ours, send your soldier powers
These words I announce, hope you heard 'em like cows
Alpha Kenny buddy, Roger, Charlie, and Rich
Bitch, my swag bitches, but you can’t touch this
So click, click, click, please get off my dick
Just ‘cause I know more don’t make me thick
I'm a overweight, heavyweight, female Slick Rick
If you need the trees then my shits got stick
I got bug spray, bucket, stick
Tons of the fun stuff, tons and tons of it

[Hook]
Bring the noise when we run upon them!
Bring the noise when we run upon them!
Bring the noise when we run upon them!
Bring the noise when we run upon them!

[Refrain]
Dem-dem-dem-free-freekdem
Dem-dem-dem-free-free-dem

[Verse 3]
My nan was a stan for imported liquor brands
72 bottles at her birthday got drank
I must say people I got her to freaking thank
I'm a party fucking animal, if you ain't, scram!
My uncle jumped a boat, it took him to Iran
What started as a life now it got him banned
So I came in a hurry, not a white van
Learnt that Sam, Ram, Chan, are the same man
Corrugated iron wooden shacks
Gated mansions next to XX
Boys on motor bikes next to Maybachs
We got backpacks next to cats from Kyzack
Ex-convicts and diplomats
Rapper and Russians who don't pay tax
These cards are stacked and this is out crack
Rewind, pull it, and bring it all back

[Hook]
Bring the noise when we run upon them!
Bring the noise when we run upon them!
Bring the noise when we run upon them!
Bring the noise when we run upon them!

[Refrain]
Dem-dem-dem-free-freekdem
Dem-dem-dem-free-free-dem

[Outro]
Freedom’s just another word
Choose
Nothing left to lose
Choose
Freedom’s just another word
Choose
Nothing left to lose
Choose
Freedom’s just another word
Choose
Nothing left to lose

[Intro]
How y'all feeling tonight?
Thank y'all for coming out to this impromptu-type performance I just set up
I love the energy in this city
This is one of my hometowns, y'all know I stayed out here, right?
But I came here for the creativity more than anything,
Because creativity fuels everything
I hate business people
People get on the phone with me and talk to me
Like "What kind of business can he do though?
What type of businnes are you doing? What's the numbers?
How much did you sell? What's the radio spins?
How much shampoo can you sell with your face on it and shit?"
Remind me again why we in this shit?
Can you remind me again why we in this shit?
Make it even more mellow, make it just the chords

[Verse 1]
Remind me again why we in this shit?
Remind me again why we in this shit?
Remind me again why we in this shit?
I know it's for more than just to get rich.
Since when was making music about getting rich?
Since when was making art about getting rich?
I know it's easy for me to say
Because having money's not everything and not having it is
Remind me again why we in this shit?
Remind me again why we in this shit?
Remind me again why the Grammy's could suck my dick?
Remind me who's the original superfly
And I got love for Hov but I ain't fucking with that Suit and Tie
Remind me again, remind me again why we in this shit?
Remind me again, remind me again why we in this shit?
Every nigga tryna get rich,
Every rapper tryna get rich,
And every rapper always rap about fucking somebody else bitch
Remind me again why we in this shit?
Remind me again why we in this shit?
And why the Grammys can suck my dick
Suck my dick

[Verse 2]
And every motherfucking sponsor
They tryna put they logos all over the concerts and shit
For a meet and greet
And you gotta meet the execs and they daughters
And they'll show what they just bought her
Real niggas don't live too long in this shit
Real niggas don't live too long in this shit
Real niggas don't live too long in this shit
Real niggas don't live too long in this shit
Real niggas don't live too long in this shit
They say "Ayo, you coming on too strong in this bitch"
They always talking about what I'm doing wrong in this shit
Well I can give a fuck everything
I can give a fucking anything
Remind me why we in this shit
I lost my motherfucking momma
So I can give a fuck about your comments
I promise, I promise
Cause we all gonna die one day
But I'mma live my life my way!
Remind me why we in this shit, please

[Verse 3]
Please, can I sell your drink for you, please
"So, you can help me put on a better show please, corporations?
Can you please support me? Please?
Me, Kanye West. I swear I’m a nice nigga now
I swear I’ll put the pink polo back on,
I swear to you. Please. Just for 3 million
I need it so bad. I need a pool in my backyard!
So I’ll tell all my fans your shit is cool
And if they believe in me, then they should also believe in you
"‘Did we get the check yet? Hold on, I gotta call the business manager
Did the corporations send the check?
What is my public rating? Are people liking me again?
Enough to get some money from the corporations?
Are they liking me, is it ok now?
They forgot about the whole Beyoncé thing, right?
Ok, Cool.
Is it ok now?"

[Verse 4]
Remind me why we in this shit
Remind me why we in this shit
Cause we ain't on no pile of shit
Nigga I'mma make my music from my heart
And I live and I die by everything that I say
And everything that I do
And everything that make is what I believe to be true
And if the shit don't make sense and sound like nonsense
I don't give a fuck because that was my stream of conscious
And that's the way I felt at that time
And feelings was the only facts
And racism and materialism is killing blacks
And one more thing if I can ask
One more thing if I can add

[Verse 5]
Cause in this life, our life just moves to fast
And time is somethng tht you can never get back
What's your quality of life?
What's your quality of life?
And that's why I mean it when I say I hope you have a good time tonight
I hope you have a good time tonight
London, it's Louise Wilson's birthday tonight

[Bridge]
An inspiration, not lead instruments
I'm the lead instrument, but he's background
Happy birthday to Louise who taught Alexander McQueen
My friend Louis Gold, Christopher King, Stella McCartney
And Kanye West, even though she doesn't want me to put that on my resume

[Outro]
But it's still sometimes like there's no good ideas
And no real ideas and nothing sincere left
And everything has been so homogenized
And it's all big business and it's no creativity
But really we have the ability to have a human Utopia
If we just helped each other
If we just use our resources
And stop tryna compete against each other
And tryna beat each other
And eat each other
And maybe came together and tried to teach each other
And reach each other
And reach each other
Maybe try to come together and love each other
And love each other
And love one another
Maybe try to come together and love each other
And love each other
And love each other
And love another
And love each other
And love each other
And love each other
And love another
The way you love you love your mother man
The way you should love your father man
Y'all don't really understand
Cause this is our shit
And is this our motherfucking clique
Clique, clique clique
Ain't nobody fresher than my motherfucking clique
Clique, clique, clique
I said ain't nobody fresher than my motherfucking clique
Clique, clique, clique
I said ain't nobody fresher than my motherfucking clique

[Verse]
Those who are dead are not dead
They're just living in my head
And since I fell for that spell
I am living there as well, oh

[Chorus]
Time is so short
And I'm sure
There must be something more

[Verse]
Those who are dead are not dead
They're just living in my head, oh
And since I fell for that spell
I am living there as well, oh

[Chorus]
Time is so short
And I'm sure
There must be something more

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
You thought you might be a ghost
You thought you might be a ghost
You didn't get to heaven, but you made it close
You didn't get to heaven, but you made it close
You thought you might be a ghost
You thought you might be a ghost
You didn’t get to heaven, but you made it close
You didn’t get to heaven, but you oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-ooh
Oh, oh

[Outro]
Those who are dead are not dead
They're just living in my head
Detroit

There is a resilience that rises from somewhere deep within your streets
You can't define it, but you can feel it
You can feel it overflowing from the people who call you home
From people who are always proud to declare, 'I'm from Detroit'
You took our country from it's infancy, into industry
And your name still carries with it the idea of a nation built on steel, muscle and sweat
You became the city that carried the country
The city, like the sport, is built on dreams
People who would drive to you, driven to excel
Who know nothing is accomplished without hardwork, without sacrifice
When you hurt, we hurt
Your streets witness our struggle
Your bricks are our rage through the emptiness of each house shuttered, of each factory closed
We've lived through the ups and the downs
But we remain, Detroit
We can never turn our backs on you Detroit, because we are you
My home
The home of Motown, Cadillac and Joe Louis
Through all this, we cannot be defeated, because we have never been defeated
You've built us, you've moved us, you've shaped us
Sometimes down, but never out
Take strength in us, your people
Stay up Detroit

[Verse 1]
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
Tomorrow I'll miss you
Remember I'll always be true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home everyday
And I'll send all my loving to you

[Verse 2]
I'll pretend that I'm kissing
The lips I am missing
And hope that my dreams will come true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home everyday
And I'll send all my loving to you

[Chorus 1]
All my loving I will send to you
All my loving, darling, I'll be true

[Verse 3]
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
Tomorrow I'll miss you
Remember I'll always be true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home everyday
And I'll send all my loving to you

[Chorus 2]
All my loving I will send to you
All my loving, darling, I'll be true
All my loving, all my loving, ooh
All my loving I will send to you

[Verse - Jimi Hendrix]
Have mercy, have mercy
Have mercy people, listen now
You know what it means to be left alone
Have mercy, people
Do you know what it means to be left alone?
No letter today
Not even a call on my telephone

Every, every morning
Every morning I hear the birds call my name
Every morning I hear the birds call my name
Oh little birds call me
Because my heart is so much in pain
Heaven

[Epic Solo]

[Outro - Jimi Hendrix]
Have mercy
A little loving is all in the world I need
Have mercy, have mercy now
A little loving is all in the world I need
Misunderstanding and a no good woman
They both have caused my heart to bleed
If you love me like you say
Why you treat me like you do
If you love me like you say
Why you treat me like you do

Well, I ain't no fool
Yeah, I'm cool, I know the rules

Said you'd never run around
Said you'd never stay out late
Said you'd never run around
Said you'd never stay out late

Let me tell, you pretty baby
Oh, I gotta set you straight

Said you'd never run around
Said you'd never stay out late
Said you'd never run around
Said you'd never stay out late
Let me tell you, pretty baby
Oh, I gotta set you straight
Got a call from my neighbor this morning
Told me that my baby was gone
Got a call from my neighbor this morning
Told me that my baby was gone

Took the keys to my cadillac
Left my clothes out all alone

Came home last night
With a pistol pointed at my head
Came home last night
With a pistol pointed at my head

Said, "You better fess up, oh boy
Or I swear I'm gonna shoot you dead

I didn't know something was wrong
Somethin' wrong been going on
I should've known
I didn't know somethin' been going wrong
When my neighbor called, oh yeah
I found out that little girl was staying next door

[Verse]
Baby, let me move you
Ooh baby, let me move you
Baby, let me move you
Ooh baby, let  me move you
You know you're looking so good there mama
Ooh baby, let me move you
With your pretty fine self
You know you're looking so good

I just want to move you
I just want to move you
You know you're looking so good, mama
Have you ever been moved
Come on let me move you
Have you ever been moved
You looking so good
I like the way you groove baby
I just want to move you
Tell me, have you ever been moved
Baby let me move you
Early in the morning
Let me move you
Darling, in the midnight hour
Oh baby, let me move you
Anytime, anywhere, anyhow
I just want to move you
I just want to move you
I don't care, I don't mind
It don't matter how you let me move you
Come on baby
And let me move you, ah!

Come on little girl
Take me, take me by my hand
Come on, come on tell me
I'm your sweet loving man
Come on, come on and tell me
That I'm the best man in the land

[Outro]
Good God almighty, let me move you
Little girl, come on let me move you
Let me move you
Got your body, I just want to move you
If I don't live another day
I just want to move you, little girl today

[Intro]

[Chorus]
Izabella

[Verse 1]
I’m dreaming about you every night in my bed
Every night
You know good and well darling
We got this war to fight
So I hope you're receiving me baby
You know I hope everything’s all right

[Chorus]
Izabella

[Verse 2]
Girl, I'm fighting this war for the children and you
Hey sweet darling, please give me a chance to get myself together for you
You wait for me and save your love child
When I know I may pretend true

[Chorus]
Izabella

[Verse 3]
Girl, here comes the rays of the rising sun
Oh my heart is coming by baby
I think I can feel it just begun
Keep those dreams coming in strong
Maybe one day I’ll be holding you instead of these machine guns

[Chorus]
Izabella

[Guitar Outro]

[Verse]
Hey
You don’t love me, you just want me
So let’s make it baby, so I can leave
You don’t need me, you just want to bleed me
So take out your dagger, and cut me free, cut me free
Cut me free
Hey

Hey
You don’t love me, you just want to suffocate me
So hand me your blankets and take your dirty sheets
Dirty sheets, yeah
Take your dirty sheets
Well, I must admit that you can be a pretty good artist
But I've never seen that smile painted all across your face
Baby, baby on your
Baby, on your face
Baby, on your face
Oh, I do declare you should be a rocket
You get me spaced out, laid out, look at the sun fade out
And you almost made me leave my faith outside
Hey
Look at you, all lovey-dovey when you mess around with that needle
Well I
I wonder how would your loving be otherwise
I wonder just how would your loving be, otherwise
Well dig this brother
I’m going to spank your hands and I’m going to throw away your stupid needle
I’m going to try to make love straight, for the very first and last time
Slow it down sugar, unless you in a hurry to die

[Outro]
You don’t love me girl, you just want to hurt me
So let’s hurry and get this scene over so can marry up with that old sweet
You don’t need me, you just want to see me watch you, run after that suicide ball
Bouncing across the freeway
Bang, bang! Shoot, shoot
As long as you’re yourself girl, I’ll try not to give a hoot
Oh, yeah, yes, slow down
Bang, bang! Shoot, shoot
Slow down, slow down, slow down

[Verse]
Hey gypsy boy
Where do you come from
From the land (of the) new rising sun

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey gypsy boy
Where do you plan to go to
I'm going to spread a lot of love
And of peace of mind too
Lord, may I come along

[Chorus]
May I come along
May I come along
May I come along
May I come along
May I come along
May I come along

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey gypsy boy
Where do you plan to go to
I'm going to spread a lot of love
And of peace of mind too
Lord, may I come along

[Chorus]
May I come along
May I come along
May I come along

[Verse 1]
Flames
I see electric flames you all
They are burning all over
All over me
Voodoo, Voodoo
That’s what they call it now
And you best better
Gone and let it be
But I've always been a gambling man
So you know I’m going to, going to, going to take a chance
This why because
Can’t love electric flames
Though it can fuck with me
Because I’m, I’m a Mojo Man
And I’m from
Let me tell you, I’m from Voodoo Land

[Chorus]
Mojo Man
From a far away land
Got to change anything you all, anything
With the touch of hand
You made me
Whoever you may be
Just take my voodoo ingenuity

[Verse 2]
I was raised in a land way back
Near a Fiji land
With a one eyed toad, just walking, in the palm of my hand
Devils, troubles, witches prove
Every girl to me
And old black cats, were my company
So you know I wasn't alone

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Mojo, mojo, mojo, mojo, mojo, Mojo Man now
I’m a Mojo Man
I’m going to say it
I’m a Mojo Man
I’m a Mojo Man

[Verse 1]
Whenever I want you around, yeah
All I got to do
Is call you on the phone
And you'll come running home
Yeah, that's all I got to do

[Verse 2]
And when I, I want to kiss you, yeah
All I got to do
Is whisper in your ear
The words you long to hear
And I'll be kissin' you

[Bridge]
And the same goes for me
Whenever you want me at all
I'll be here, yes, I will
Whenever you call
You just got to call on me, yeah
You just got to call on me

[Verse 2]
And when I, I want to kiss you, yeah
All I got to do
Is call you on the phone
And you'll come runnin' home
Yeah, that's all I got to do

[Bridge]
And the same goes for me
Whenever you want me at all
I'll be here, yes, I will
Whenever you call
You just got to call on me, yeah
You just got to call on me

[Spoken Intro]
Happy New Year, first of all
I hope we have about a million, or two million more of them
If we can get over this summer; hehehe
I'd like to dedicate this one to, uh
The draggy scene that's going on
All the soldiers that are fighting in Chicago and Milwaukee and New York
Oh yes, and all the soldiers fighting in Vietnam
I'd like to do a thing called "Machine Gun"

[Refrain]
Machine gun
Tearing my body all apart
Machine gun
Tearing my body all apart

[Verse 1]
Evil man make me kill you
Evil man make you kill me
Evil man make me kill you
Even though we're only families apart

[Verse 2]
Well I pick up my axe and fight like a farmer
You know what I mean?
Hey, and your bullets keep knocking me down
Hey, I pick up my axe and fight like a farmer now
Yeah, but you still blast me down, to the ground

[Verse 3]
The same way you shoot me down, baby
You'll be going just the same
Three times the pain
And your own self to blame
Hey, machine gun

[Solo]

[Verse 4]
I ain't afraid of your mess no more, babe
I ain't afraid no more
After awhile your, your cheap talk won't even cause me pain
So let your bullets fly like rain
Because I know all the time you're wrong baby
And you'll be going just the same

[Refrain]
Yeah, machine gun
Tearing my family apart
Yeah, yeah, alright
Tearing my family apart

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 5]
Don't you shoot him down
He's about to leave here
Don't you shoot him down
He's got to stay here
He ain't going nowhere
He's been shot down to the ground
Oh where he can't survive no, no

[Outro]
Yeah, that's what we don't want to hear anymore, alright
(No bullets)
At least here, huh huh
(No guns, no bombs)
Huh huh
No nothing, just let's all live and live
You know instead of killing

[Verse 1]
I don't think I'm going to go to L.A. anymore
I don't think I'm going to go to L.A. anymore
I don't know what it's like to land
And not race to your door
I don't think I'm going to go to L.A. anymore
I don't think I'm going to go to L.A. anymore
I'm not sure that I really ever could
Hold on to your hotel key
And your bedroom neighborhood
And be sleepwalking in Hollywood

[Chorus]
I'm going to steer clear
Or burn up in your atmosphere
I'm going to steer clear
Because I'd die if I saw you
I'd die if I didn't see you there
So I don't think I'm going to go to L.A. anymore

[Verse 2]
I don't think I'm going to go to L.A. anymore
I'd get lost on the boulevard at night
Without your voice to tell me
"I love you, take a right"
The ten and the two is the loneliest sight

[Chorus]
I'm going to steer clear
Or burn up in your atmosphere
I'm going to steer clear
Because I'd die if I saw you
I'd die if I didn't see you there
So I don't think I'm going to go to L.A. anymore

[Bridge]
I think I'm going to stay
Going to stay in the gray
Think I'm going to stay
And all the street lights say
"Never mind, never mind"
And the canyon lines say
"Never mind, never mind"
The sunset says
"We see this all the time"
Never mind, never you mind

[Outro]
Wherever I go, whatever I do
I wonder where I am in my relationship to you
Wherever you go, wherever you are
I watch that pretty life play out in pictures from afar
Wherever I go, whatever I do
I wonder where I am in my relationship to you
Wherever you go, wherever you are
I watch that pretty life play out in pictures from afar

[Chorus]
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, till I belong to you

[Verse 1]
Every night when everybody has fun
Here am I sitting all on my own

[Chorus]
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, till I belong to you

[Bridge]
Since you left me, I'm so alone
Now you're coming, you're coming on home
I'll be good like I know I should
You're coming home, you're coming home

[Verse 2]
Every night the tears come down from my eyes
Every day I've done nothing but cry

[Chorus]
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, till I belong to you

[Bridge]
Since you left me, I'm so alone
Now you're coming, you're coming on home
I'll be good like I know I should
You're coming home, you're coming home

[Verse 3]
So every day we'll be happy I know
Now I know that you won't leave me no more

[Chorus/Outro]
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, till I belong to you

[Verse 1]
You jump in front of my car when you
You know all the time that
Ninety miles an hour, girl, is the speed I drive
You tell me it's alright, you don't mind a little pain
You say you just want me to take you for a drive

[Chorus]
You're just like (crosstown traffic)
So hard to get through to you
(Crosstown traffic)
I don't need to run over you
(Crosstown traffic)
All you do is slow me down
And I'm trying to get on the other side of town

[Verse 2]
I'm not the only soul who's accused of hit and run
Tire tracks all across your back
I can ha, I can see you had your fun
But uh, darling can't you see my signals turn from green to red
And with you I can see a traffic jam straight up ahead

[Chorus]
You're just like (crosstown traffic)
So hard to get through to you
(Crosstown traffic)
I don't need to run over you
(Crosstown traffic)
All you do is slow me down
And I got better things on the other side of town

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
(Crosstown traffic)
Look out, (look out)
Look out baby, comin through
(Crosstown traffic)
Yeah yeah, (look out)
(Crosstown traffic)
(Yeah) yeah, (look out)
Look out, look out baby
(Crosstown traffic)
Yeah, (look out)
What's that on the street?
Move over
(Crosstown traffic)
Yeah, (look out)
Yeah! (Crosstown traffic)
Yeah, (look out)

[Verse 1]
Since she's been gone
I want no one to talk to me
It's not the same, but I'm to blame, it's plain to see
So go away, leave me alone
Don't bother me

[Verse 2]
I can't believe that she would leave me on my own
It's just not right, when every night I'm all alone
I've got no time for you right now
Don't bother me

[Bridge]
I know I'll never be the same
If I don't get her back again
Because I know she'll always be
The only girl for me

[Verse 3]
But till she's here
Please, don't come near, just stay away
I'll let you know when she's come home until that day
Don't come around, leave me alone
Don't bother me

[Guitar Solo]

[Refrain]
I've got no time for you right now
Don't bother me

[Bridge]
I know I'll never be the same
If I don't get her back again
Because I know she'll always be
The only girl for me

[Verse 3]
But till she's here
Please, don't come near, just stay away
I'll let you know when she's come home until that day
Don't come around, leave me alone
Don't bother me

[Outro]
Don't bother me
Don't bother me
Don't bother me
Don't bother me
Don't-

[Chorus]
Little child, little child
Little child, won't you dance with me?
I'm so sad and lonely
Baby take a chance with me

[Chorus]
Little child, little child
Little child, won't you dance with me?
I'm so sad and lonely
Baby take a chance with me

[Verse 1]
If you want someone
To make you feel so fine
Then we'll have some fun
When you're mine, all mine
So come, come on, come on

[Chorus]
Little child, little child
Little child, won't you dance with me?
I'm so sad and lonely
Baby take a chance with me

[Instrumental Break / Harmonica Solo]

[Verse 2]
When you're by my side
You're the only one
Don't you run and hide
Just come on, come on
Yeah come on, come on, come on

[Chorus]
Little child, little child
Little child, won't you dance with me?
I'm so sad and lonely
Baby take a chance with me (Oh yeah)
Baby take a chance with me (Oh yeah)
Baby take a chance with me (Oh yeah)

[Verse 1]
There were bells on a hill
But I never heard them ringing
No, I never heard them at all
Till there was you

[Verse 2]
There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging
No, I never saw them at all
Till there was you

[Bridge]
Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew

[Verse 3]
There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was you

[Bridge]
Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew

[Verse 3]
There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was you

[Outro]
Till there was you

[Verse 1: George Harrison]
Well, gonna write a little letter
Gonna mail it to my local DJ
It's a rocking little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven
Gotta hear it again today

[Verse 2: George Harrison]
You know my temperature's rising
And the jukebox blows a fuse
My heart's beating rhythm
And my soul keeps singing the blues
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

[Verse 3: George Harrison]
I've got a rocking pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues (Woo)
I think I caught off the writer
Sitting down by the rhythm revue
Roll over Beethoven
Rocking in two by two

[Verse 4: George Harrison]
Well if you feel it and like it
Well get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up
Just a trifle further and reel and rock it
Roll it over
Roll over Beethoven
Rocking in two by two (Woo)

[Guitar Solo: George Harrison]

[Verse 5: George Harrison]
Well early in the morning
I'm a-giving you the warning
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle
I'll play my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news

[Verse 6: George Harrison]
You know she wiggles like a glow worm
Dance like a spinning top
She's got a crazy partner
Oughta see 'em reel and rock
As long as she got a dime
The music will never stop

[Outro: George Harrison]
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Dig to these rhythm and blues

[Verse 1]
It feels so right now, hold me tight
Tell me I'm the only one, and then I might
Never be the lonely one
So hold (hold), me tight (me tight)
Tonight (tonight), tonight (tonight)
It's you, you, you, you

[Verse 2]
Hold me tight
Let me go on loving you
Tonight, tonight
Making love to only you
So hold (hold), me tight (me tight)

Being here alone tonight with you

Never be the lonely one
So hold (hold), me tight (me tight)

[Verse 1]
Look into my eyes he tells her
I'm gonna say goodbye he says, yeah
Do not cry she begs of him goodbye, yeah
All that day she thinks of his love, yeah
They whip him through the streets and alleys there
The gormless and the baying crowd right there
They can't get enough of that doomsday song
They can't get enough of it all
Listen

[Verse 2]
Listen to the whores he tells her
He fashions paper sculptures of them
Then drags them to the river's bank in the cart
Their soggy paper bodies wash ashore in the dark
And the priest stiff in hate now demanding fun begin
Of his women dressed as men for the pleasure of that priest

[Chorus]
Here I am, not quite dying
My body left to rot in a hollow tree
Its branches throwing shadows on the gallows for me
And the next day, and the next, and another day

[Verse 3]
Ignoring the pain of their particular diseases
They chase him through the alleys chase him down the steps
They haul him through the mud and they chant for his death
And drag him to the feet of the purple headed priest
First they give you everything that you want
Then they take back everything that you have
They live upon their feet and they die upon their knees
They can work with Satan while they dress like the saints
They know God exists for the Devil told them so
They scream my name aloud down into the well below

[Chorus]
Here I am, not quite dying
My body left to rot in a hollow tree
Its branches throwing shadows on the gallows for me
And the next day, and the next, and another day
Here I am, not quite dying
My body left to rot in a hollow tree
Its branches throwing shadows on the gallows for me
And the next day, and the next, and another day
Here I am, not quite dying
My body left to rot in a hollow tree
Its branches throwing shadows on the gallows for me
And the next day, and the next, and another day

[Outro]
Listen
I don't like you
But I love you
Seems that I'm always
Thinking of you
Oh, oh, oh
You treat me badly
I love you madly
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

I don't want you
But I need you
Don't want to kiss you
But I need you
Oh, oh, oh
You do me wrong now
My love is strong now
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Tied up
Tied up
I want to leave you
Don't want to stay here
Don't want to spend
Another day here
Oh, oh, oh, I want to split now
I just can quit now
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me, baby

I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me

You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me

[Verse 1]
I wanna be your lover, baby
I wanna be your man
I wanna be your lover, baby

Love you like no other, baby

Love you like no other, baby
Like no other can

[Chorus]
I wanna be your man, I wanna be your man
I wanna be your man, I wanna be your man

[Verse 2]

Let me understand
Tell me that you love me, baby

I wanna be your lover baby
I wanna be your man

[Chorus]
I wanna be your man, I wanna be your man
I wanna be your man, I wanna be your man

[Verse 1]

I wanna be your man
I wanna be your lover, baby
I wanna be your man
Love you like no other, baby
Like no other can
Love you like no other, baby
Like no other can

[Chorus]
I wanna be your man, I wanna be your man
I wanna be your man, I wanna be your man

[Outro]
I wanna be your man
Oh, I wanna be your man
Come on, I wanna be your man
Now let me be your man

[Verse 1]
If you're listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not
We just wrote it like that

[Verse 2]
When you're listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are
They just play it like that

[Chorus 1]
It doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As it's only a Northern song

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus 2]
It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When it's only a Northern song

[Verse 3]
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
You're correct
There's nobody there
And I told you there's no one there

[Chorus]
(She's got the devil in her heart)
But her eyes, they tantalize
(She's going to tear your heart apart)
Oh, her lips, they really thrill me

[Verse 1]
I'll take my chances, for romance is
So important to me
She'll never hurt me, she won't desert me
She's an angel sent to me

[Chorus]
(She's got the devil in her heart)
No, no, this I can't believe
(She's going to tear your heart apart)
No, no, nay will she deceive

[Verse 2]
I can't believe that she'll ever, ever go
Not when she hugs me and says she loves me so
She'll never hurt me, she won't desert me
Listen, can't you see?

[Chorus]
(She's got the devil in her heart)
Oh, no, no, no, this I can't believe
(She's going to tear your heart apart)
No, no, nay will she deceive

[Verse 3]
Don't take chances if your romance is
So important to you
She'll never hurt me, she won't desert me
She's an angel sent to me

[Chorus]
(She's got the devil in her heart)
No, no, no, no, this I can't believe
(She's going to tear your heart apart)
No, no, nay will she deceive

[Outro]
(She's got the devil in her heart)
'Cause she's an angel sent to me
(She's got the devil in her heart)
No, she's an angel sent to me

[Verse 1]
You know you made me cry
I see no use in wondering why
I cry for you

[Verse 2]
And now you've changed your mind
I see no reason to change mine
I cry it's through, oh

[Chorus]
You're giving me the same old line
I'm wondering why
You hurt me then
You're back again
No, no, no, not a second time

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 1]
You know you made me cry
I see no use in wondering why
I cry for you

[Verse 2]
And now you've changed your mind
I see no reason to change mine
I cry it's through, oh

[Chorus]
You're giving me the same old line
I'm wondering why
You hurt me then
You're back again
No, no, no, not a second time

[Outro]
Not a second time
Not a second time
No no no no no
Not a second time

[Verse 1]
The best things in life are free
But you can keep 'em for the birds and bees

[Intro: John Lennon]
I Dig a Pygmy by Charles Hawtrey and the Deaf Aids
Phase one, in which Doris gets her oats

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Two of us riding nowhere, spending someone's
Hard earned pay
You and me Sunday driving, not arriving
On our way back home

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Two of us sending postcards, writing letters
On my wall
You and me burning matches, lifting latches
On our way back home

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Two of us wearing raincoats, standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper, getting nowhere
On our way back home

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
You and I have memories
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead

[Verse 4: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Two of us wearing raincoats, standing solo
In the sun
You and me chasing paper, getting nowhere
On our way back home

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home

[Outro]
We're going home
You better believe it
Goodbye

[Verse 1]
I dig a pony
Well, you can celebrate anything you want
Yes, you can celebrate anything you want
Oh!

Well, you can penetrate any place you go
Yes, you can penetrate any place you go
I told you so

[Chorus]
All I want is you
Everything has got to be just like you want it to
Because

[Verse 2]
I pick a moon dog
Well, you can radiate everything you are
Yes, you can radiate everything you are
Oh, now
I roll a stoney
Well, you can imitate everyone you know
Yes, you can imitate everyone you know
I told you so

[Chorus]
All I want is you
Everything has got to be just like you want it to
Because

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Ooh, now

Well, you can indicate everything you see
Yes, you can indicate anything you see
Oh now

Well, you can syndicate any boat you row
Yeah, you can syndicate any boat you row
I told you so

[Chorus]
All I want is you
Everything has got to be just like you want it to
Because

[Outro]
You

[Verse 1]
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

[Chorus]
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

[Verse 2]
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe

[Chorus]
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

[Verse 3]
Sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my open ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on across the universe

[Chorus]
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

[Outro]
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva

[Verse 1]
All through the day
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
All through the night

Now they're frightened of leaving it
Everyone's weaving it
Coming on strong all the time
All through the day

[Chorus]
I-I-me-me-mine

Flowing more freely than wine
All through the day
I me mine

Oh, dirty Maggie Mae, they have taken her away
And she never walk down Lime Street anymore
Oh, the judge he guilty found her for robbing a homeward bounder
That dirty no good robbing Maggie Mae
This is a part of Liverpool, they returned me to
Two pounds ten a week, that was my pay

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
I've got a feeling, a feeling deep inside
Oh yeah, oh yeah, that's right

Yeah, yeah! I've got a feeling, yeah!

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
All these years I've been wandering around
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody who looked like you!
Ooh!

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
I've got a feeling, that keeps me on my toes
Oh yeah, oh yeah (Oh yeah!)
I've got a feeling, I think that everybody knows
Oh yeah, oh yeah! Oh yeah

Everybody had a good time
Everybody had a wet dream

[Verse 1]
My baby said she's traveling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm traveling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
Said she's traveling on the one after 909

[Verse 2]
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees
You're only fooling 'round, only fooling 'round with me
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
Said she's traveling on the one after 909

[Chorus]
Pick up my bags, run to the station
Railman said "You've got the wrong location"
Pick up my bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong

[Verse 1]
Well, she said she's traveling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm traveling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
She said she's traveling on the one after 909

[Chorus]
Pick up my bag, run to the station
Railman says you've got the wrong location
Pick up my bag, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong

[Verse 1]
Well, she said she's traveling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm traveling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
Said she's traveling on the one after 9-0
Said she's traveling on the one after 9-0
Said she's traveling on the one after 909

[Let It Be Version - Outro]
Oh, Danny boy, the old savanna calling

[Verse 1]
The long and winding road that leads to your door
Will never disappear, I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to your door

[Verse 2]
The wild and windy night that the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears, crying for the day
Why leave me standing here?
Let me know the way

[Bridge]
Many times I've been alone, and many times I've cried
Anyway, you'll never know the many ways I've tried

[Verse 3]
And still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here
Lead me to your door

[Orchestral Solo]

[Verse 4]
But still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here (Don't keep me waiting)
Lead me to your door

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I wanna make it cool again
I know you're feeling bad
Tell me when you're cool again

[Chorus]
Who'd have ever thought of it?
Who'd have ever dreamed
That a small-town girl like you
Would be the boss of me?

You fly through the night
With tears on your lips
Life has your mind and soul
It spins on your hips

[Pre-Chorus]
Who'd have ever thought of it?
Who'd have ever dreamed?

[Chorus]
Who'd have ever thought of it?
Who'd have ever dreamed?
That a small-town girl like you
Would be the boss of me?
Would be the boss of me?
Would be the boss of me?

[Bridge]
You looked at me and you weeped for the free blue sky
I look to the stars as they flicker and float in your eyes
And under these wings of steel the small town dies

[Pre-Chorus]
Who'd have ever thought of it?
Who'd have ever dreamed?

[Chorus]
Who'd have ever thought of it?
Who'd have ever dreamed?
That a small-town girl like you
Would be the boss of me?

[Break]

[Chorus]
Who would have ever thought of it?
Who would have ever dreamed?
That a small-town girl like you
Would be the boss of me?
Would be the boss of me?
Would be the boss of me?

That boy took my love away
Though he'll regret it someday
But this boy wants you back again

That boy isn't good for you
Though he may want you too
This boy wants you back again

Would always feel the same
If this boy gets you back again

[Intro: John Lennon]
If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
'Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
If I trust in you, oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too, oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her

[Bridge]
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I
Would be sad if our new love
Was in vain

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

[Bridge: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I
Would be sad if our new love
Was in vain

[Verse 4: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]

Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

If I fell in love with you

[Intro]
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me

[Verse 1]
I don't want to kiss or hold your hand
If it's funny try and understand
There is really nothing else I'd rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you

[Verse 2]
I don't need to hug or hold you tight
I just want to dance with you all night
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you

[Bridge]
Just to dance with you
Is everything I need
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me

[Verse 3]
If somebody tries to take my place
Let's pretend we just can't see his face
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you

[Bridge]
Just to dance with you
Is everything I need
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me

[Verse 3]
If somebody tries to take my place
Let's pretend we just can't see his face
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
I've discovered I'm in love with you
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you

[Verse 1]
I give her all my love
That's all I do
And if you saw my love
You'd love her too
I love her

[Verse 2]
She gives me everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me
And I love her

[Bridge]
A love like ours
Could never die
As long as I
Have you near me

[Verse 3]
Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her

[Chorus]
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me

[Verse 1]
Well I gave you everything I had
But you left me sitting on my own
Did you have to treat me, oh, so bad
All I do is hang my head and moan

[Chorus]
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me

[Verse 2]
If there's something I have said or done
Tell me what and I'll apologize
If you don't, I really can't go on
Holding back these tears in my eyes

[Chorus]
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me

[Verse 3]
Well I beg you on my bended knees
If you'll only listen to my pleas
Is there anything I can do
'Cause I really can't stand it, I'm so in love with you

[Chorus]
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me

[Chorus]
Any time at all, any time at all
Any time at all, all you've gotta do is call and I'll be there

[Verse 1]
If you need somebody to love
Just look into my eyes
I'll be there to make you feel right

If you're feeling sorry and sad
I'd really sympathize
Don't you be sad, just call me tonight

[Chorus]
Any time at all, any time at all
Any time at all, all you've gotta do is call and I'll be there

[Verse 2]
If the sun has faded away
I'll try to make it shine
There's nothing I won't do
When you need a shoulder to cry on
I hope it will be mine
Call me tonight, and I'll come to you

[Chorus]
Any time at all, any time at all
Any time at all, all you've gotta do is call and I'll be there

Any time at all, any time at all
Any time at all, all you've gotta do is call and I'll be there

Any time at all, all you've gotta do is call and I'll be there

[Verse 1]
I've got every reason on earth to be mad
Cause I've just lost the only girl I had
If I could get my way
I'd get myself locked up today
But I can't so I'll cry instead

[Verse 2]
I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger than my feet
I can't talk to people that I meet
If I could see you now
I'd try to make you sad somehow
But I can't so I'll cry instead

[Bridge]
Don't wanna cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away-hey
But I'll come back again someday

[Verse 3]
And when I do you better hide all the girls
I'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world
Yes, I'm gonna break 'em in two
And show you what your loving man can do
Until then I'll cry instead

[Bridge]
Don't wanna cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away-hey
But I'll come back again someday

[Verse 3]
And when I do you better hide all the girls
'Cause I'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world
Yes, I'm gonna break 'em in two
And show you what your loving man can do
Until then I'll cry instead

[Chorus]
Whoa-I, whoa-I
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home

[Verse 1]
Come on, on my way
'Cause I'm-a going to see my baby today
I've got a whole lot of things I've gotta say to her

[Chorus]
Whoa-I, whoa-I
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home

[Verse 2]
Come on if you please
I've got no time for trivialities
I've got a girl who's waiting home for me tonight

[Chorus]
Whoa-I, whoa-I
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home

[Bridge]
When I'm getting home tonight
I'm going to hold her tight
I'm going to love her till the cows come home
I bet I'll love her more
Till I walk out that door
Again

[Verse 3]
Come on, let me through
I've got so many things I've got to do
I've got no business being here with you
This way

[Chorus]
Whoa-I, whoa-I
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home, yeah
I got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home

[Intro]
Greetings people
You're now rockin' with the best
Hub City's threat
Minor of the year
K.Dot
I know the hood's been waitin', right
I'mma stop being stingy
I'mma share with y'all

[Verse]
Whoever thought young Kendrick would spit, so ignorant
Make street disciples go and get a membership
Streets revival like Creflo Dollar hustlin' on the strip
This is church
Advise you to purchase it or copy the worst
Y'all rhymes sloppy, I rhyme properly
I jam pack Monopoly dollars by puttin' 100% in every verse
Add 10% more and what do you get
A skinny nigga manipulatin' the innocent
I have no sense, ever since the Rodney King riots
Mind militant, nigga don't try it
Try to hold the peace, for I promote violence
Y'all don't rap
Y'all make a lotta noise like sirens
So I'm here to shut shit down
The four pound decorate your city
Make over your town
I'm not Diddy, but still a bad boy
'Til the reaper come get me, follow me now
Where no man has stepped, no man has repped
No man can withstand all the nights I've slept
Under my sheets, no life, thinkin' 'bout death
Fuckin' with me, you just might lose your breath
I'll take you to them pearly gates
Them golden streets
Plus a cute little casket so your body can sleep
The Hub City shit is me

[Outro]
Do you believe
It's Kendrick the God

[Intro: The Weeknd]

[Verse 1: SuaVay Nova]
Girl I'm faded girl I'm fuckin' faded
I don't see two of you I see you naked
Too much smoke in here my focus gone
Misses flower bomb come get your lotus on

You just want the drugs I just want the high
I'm seeing all of your issues from the pain all in your eyes
I can get you through yo problems girl
This that up top but ill start off from the bottom girl

Say you love me I know you love me girl
Take this sip it slow tell me you love me girl
Dont judge me girl
I'm a keep sipping Texas til you touch me girl

Faded too long
Now I'm on this rolling stone
I just can't leave it alone
It feels too much like home girl
Love me til it's gone girl

[Hook: The Weeknd & SuaVay Nova]
Love me
They want that XO shit they want that XO shit
Before they all love me
They want that XO shit well I got that XO shit
That'll make you XO quick
Until you won't love me
They want that XO shit they want that XO shit
Before they all loved me
They want that XO shit well I got that XO shit
That'll make you XO quick

[Verse 1]
This happened once before when I came to your door
No reply
They said it wasn't you
But I saw you peep through your window

[Chorus 1]
I saw the light, I saw the light
I know that you saw me
'Cause I looked up to see your face

[Verse 2]
I tried to telephone, they said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door

[Chorus 2]
I nearly died, I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place

[Bridge]
If I were you, I'd realise that I
Love you more than any other guy
And I'll forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply

[Verse 2]
I tried to telephone, they said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door

[Chorus 2]
I nearly died, I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place

[Outro]
No reply, no reply

[Verse 1]
S-I-C-K B-O-I
You should come join us nigga, we so fly
Highlighter colors, brand new sneaks
Sick Bois stick together in a pinch like cheeks
We the new Lost Boys, I'm Peter Pan
'Cause I'm in the bright green, Tinkerbell on my hand
We can run house parties, my name ain't Play
But you's a kid, you should be on your way
Colors like barkers, hoodies like Parkers
Haters on my dick, take a bite like sharkers
I'ma stay weirdo, I'm a straight hero
Haters on the side makin' numbers like zero
I'ma get flyer, numbers get higher
You would stop movin' like a flat tire
I'm not The Wire but I'm like Michael
Custom birdie green, they on dookie like fire

[Hook]
We the Sick Boi clique, we the Sick Boi clique
We the Sick Boi clique, we the Sick Boi clique
We the Sick Boi clique, we the Sick Boi clique

Sick Boi 'til I die, Sick Boi 'til I die
Sick Boi 'til I die, Sick Boi 'til I die
Sick Boi 'til I die, Sick Boi 'til I die
Sick Boi 'til I die, Sick Boi 'til I die

[Verse 2]
I'm sick like a hospital, whether you're in pain or not
I'm crazy like a swastika inside of a bagel shop
I'm the Juggernaut, bitch! Unstoppable
Think of me as hurricanes cause rappers are incomparable
Most of y'all insufferable, soundin' like a board scratch
Rappers are like ants to me, I stab 'em in the thorax
Lyrically a metaphor, Atlanta's only troubadour
Face it; only seen by a few like a unicorn
I'ma try to get my swagger right, like I'm Dolemite
Spread it all around to the kids like it's Vegemite
Get the proper etiquette, bitch you from Connecticut!
I'ma try to modify the subject like a predicate
I'm not the best rapper but I'm better than you
You with a big pickle like your name was Stu
I'm a Sick Boi, that's just how we do
Even your name's a game like you DJ Clue

[Hook]
We the Sick Boi clique, we the Sick Boi clique
We the Sick Boi clique, we the Sick Boi clique
We the Sick Boi clique, we the Sick Boi clique
We the Sick Boi clique, we the Sick Boi clique

Sick Boi 'til I die, Sick Boi 'til I die
Sick Boi 'til I die, Sick Boi 'til I die
Sick Boi 'til I die, Sick Boi 'til I die
Sick Boi 'til I die, Sick Boi 'til I die
Sick Boi 'til I die, Sick Boi 'til I die

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
When I'm walking beside her
People tell me I'm lucky
Yes, I know I'm a lucky guy
I remember the first time
I was lonely without her
Can't stop thinking about her now

[Chorus]
Every little thing she does
She does for me, yeah
And you know the things she does
She does for me, oooh

[Verse 2]
When I'm with her I'm happy
Just to know that she loves me
Yes, I know that she loves me now
There is one thing I'm sure of
I will love her forever
For I know love will never die

[Chorus]
Every little thing she does
She does for me, yeah
And you know the things she does
She does for me, oooh

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Every little thing she does
She does for me, yeah
And you know the things she does
She does for me, oooh

[Outro]
Every little thing
Every little thing

[Intro]
I'm a loser
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

[Verse 1]
Of all the love I have won or have lost
There is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end

[Chorus]
I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

[Verse 2]
Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry?

[Chorus]
I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

[Harmonica and Guitar Solos]

[Verse 3]
What have I done to deserve such a fate?
I realise I have left it too late
And so it's true, pride comes before a fall
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all

[Chorus]
I'm a loser, and I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be

[Chorus]
Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

[Verse 1]
She thinks of him
And so she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back
She's dressed in black

[Chorus]
Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

[Verse 2]
I think of her
But she thinks only of him
And though it's only a whim
She thinks of him

[Bridge]
Oh how long will it take
Till she sees the mistake she has made?

[Chorus]
Dear what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Oh how long will it take
Till she sees the mistake she has made?

[Chorus]
Dear what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

[Verse 1]
She thinks of him
And so she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back
She's dressed in black

[Chorus]
Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

[Chorus]
Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

[Verse 1]
I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

[Chorus]
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

[Verse 2]
I took my loved one over across the tracks
So she can hear my man a wailin' sax
I must admit they have a rocking band
Man, they were blowing like a hurricane

[Chorus]
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

[Verse 3]
Way down South they had a jubilee
Them Georgia folks they had a jamboree
They're drinking home brew from a wooden cup
The folks dancing there are all shook up

[Chorus]
And started playing that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

[Verse 4]
Don't care to hear them play a tango
And in the mood they take a mambo
It's way to early for a congo
So keep a rocking that piano

[Chorus]
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Oh, you got rock 'n roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

Mr. Moonlight

[Verse 1]
You came to me one summer night
And from your beam you made my dream
And from the world you sent my girl
And from above you sent us love
And now she is mine
I think you're fine
'Cause we love you, Mr. Moonlight

[Verse 2]
Mr. Moonlight, come again, please
Here I am on my knees
Begging if you please
And the night you don't come my way
I'll pray and pray more each day
'Cause we love you, Mr. Moonlight

And the night you don't come my way
Oh, I'll pray and pray more each day

Begging if you please
And the night you don't come my way
Oh, I pray and pray more each day
'Cause we love you, Mr. Moonlight
Mr. Moonlight

[Verse 1]
I don't want to spoil the party, so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here, so I will disappear
If she turns up while I'm gone, please let me know

[Verse 2]
I've had a drink or two, and I don't care
There's no fun in what I do when she's not there
I wonder what went wrong, I've waited far too long
I think I'll take a walk and look for her

[Bridge]
Though tonight she's made me sad
I still love her
If I find her, I'll be glad
I still love her

Though tonight she's made me sad

There's no fun in what I do if she's not there
I wonder what went wrong, I've waited far too long
I think I'll take a walk and look for her

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
Look what you're doing, I'm feeling blue and lonely
Would it be too much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?

[Verse 2]
You got me running, and there's no fun in it
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?

[Chorus]
I've been waiting here for you
Wondering what you're gonna do
And should you need a love that's true
It's me

[Verse 3]
Please stop your lying, you've got me crying, girl
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?

Dressed it up and they called it me

Now, today, I find you have changed your mind
Treat me like you did the night before

Love you all the time and never leave you
Please come on back to me

How was I to know you would upset me?
I didn't realize as I looked in your eyes
You told me

[Bridge]
Oh yes, you told me, you don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me and feeling like this I just can't go on anymore

[Chorus]
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride but she don't care

They're gonna put me in the movies
They're gonna make a big star out of me
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely
And all I gotta do is act naturally

[Chorus]
Well I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar, you can never tell
The movies gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well

[Verse 2]
Well I hope you'll come and see me in the movies
Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally

[Verse 3]
We'll make the scene about a man that's sad and lonely
And begging down upon his bended knee
I'll play the part and I won't need rehearsing
All I have to do is act naturally

Well I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar, you can never tell
The movies gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well

Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally

[Verse 1]
Though you've gone away this morning
You'll be back again tonight
Telling me there'll be no next time
If I just don't treat you right
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

[Verse 2]
You've tried before to leave me
But you haven't got the nerve
To walk out and make me lonely
Which is all that I deserve
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

[Bridge]
I really do, and it's nice when you believe me
If you leave me

[Verse 3]
I will follow you and bring you back where you belong
'Cause I couldn't really stand it
I admit that I was wrong
I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

[Refrain]
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

[Bridge]
I really do, and it's nice when you believe me
If you leave me

[Verse 4]
I will follow you and bring you back where you belong
'Cause I couldn't really stand it
I admit that I was wrong
I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

[Verse 1]
If you let me take your heart I will prove to you
We will never be apart if I'm part of you
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see
It is no surprise now, what you see is me

[Verse 2]
Big and black the clouds may be, time will pass away
If you put your trust in me I'll make bright your day
Look into these eyes now, tell me what you see
Don't you realise now, what you see is me
Tell me what you see

[Verse 3]
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Can't you try to see that I'm trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see
It is no surprise now, what you see is me
Tell me what you see

[Verse 4]
Listen to me one more time, how can I get through?
Can't you try to see that I'm trying to get to you?
Open up your eyes now, tell me what you see
It is no surprise now, what you see is me
Hmm

[Verse 1]
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy
The way you rock and roll
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy
When you do the stroll
Come on, Miss Lizzy
Love me before I grow too old

[Verse 2]
Come on, give me fever
Put your little hand in mine
You make me dizzy, dizzy Lizzy
Oh girl, you look so fine
Just a-rocking and a-rolling
Girl I said I wish you were mine

[Interlude]
Aw!
Aw!
Woo!

You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy
When you call my name
Oooh baby

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon baby
I want to be your loving man

[Interlude]
Ooh
Ooh
Aw!

Run and tell your mama
I want you to be my bride
Run and tell your brother
Baby, don't run and hide
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy
Girl, I want to marry you

[Verse 2]
Come on, give me fever
Put your little hand in mine, girl
You make me dizzy, dizzy Lizzy
Girl, you look so fine
You're just a-rocking and a-rolling

[Outro]

[Chorus]
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearin' me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?

[Verse 1]
The other day I saw you as I walked along the road
But when I saw him with you, I could feel my future fold
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why

[Chorus]
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearin' me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?

[Verse 2]
I met you in the morning waiting for the tides of time
But now the tide is turning, I can see that I was blind
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I used to think of no one else but you were just the same
You didn't even think of me as someone with a name
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die?
Tell me why

[Chorus]
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?

She was a working girl North of England way
Now she's hit the big time in the U.S.A.​
And if she could only hear me, this is what I'd say

[Verse 1]
Honey Pie, you are making me crazy
I'm in love, but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home

Creme tangerine and Montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
Coffee dessert, yes, you know it's good news
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

Cool cherry cream, nice apple tart
I feel your taste all the time we're apart
Coconut fudge - really blows down those blues (woo!)
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle

You might not feel it now
But when the pain cuts through
You're going to know and how
The sweat is going to fill your head
When it becomes too much
You'll shout aloud

The king of Marigold was in the kitchen
Cooking breakfast for the queen
The queen was in the parlour
Playing piano for the children of the king

So cry, baby, cry

Put on specially by the children for a lark

So cry, baby, cry
Cry, cry, cry, baby

Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number

[Verse 1]
Then there's this Welsh Rarebit wearing some brown underpants
About the shortage of grain in Hertfordshire
Everyone of them knew that as time went by
They'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower but
It's all the same thing, in this case manufactured by someone who's always
Umpteen time your father's giving it diddly-i-dee
District was leaving, intended to pay for

[Chorus]
Number nine, number nine
Who's to know?
Who was to know?

[Chorus]
Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine

[Verse 2]
I sustained nothing worse than
Also for example
Whatever you're doing
A business deal falls through
I informed him on the third night
When fortune gives

[Chorus]
Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine

[Bridge]
Right! Right!
Right, right, right, right!
Right!
Right!

[Chorus]
Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine

[Verse 3]
I've missed all of that
It makes me a few days late
Compared with, like, wow!
And weird stuff like that
Taking our sides sometimes
Floral bark
Rogue doctors have brought this specimen

I have nobody's short-cuts, aha

[Chorus]
Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine

With the situation

They are standing still

Upon the telegram

Ooh ooh

[Chorus]
Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine

Ooh

[Verse 4]
A man without terrors from beard to false
As the headmaster reported to me
My son he really can try as they do to find function
Tell what he was saying, and his voice was low and his hive high
And his eyes were low

[Pre-Chorus]
Alright!

[Chorus]
Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine

[Verse 5]
So the wife called me and we'd better go to see a surgeon
Or whatever to price it yellow underclothes
So, any road, we went to see the dentist instead
Who gave her a pair of teeth which wasn't any good at all
So instead I'd marry, join the bloody navy and went to sea

Block that kick, block that kick!

In my broken chair, my wings are broken and so is my hair
I'm not in the mood for whirling

Um da
Aaah

[Verse 6]
How?
Dogs for dogging, hands for clapping
Birds for birding and fish for fishing
Them for themming and when for whimming

Only to find the night-watchman
Unaware of his presence in the building

Onion soup

[Chorus]
Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine

Industrial output
Financial imbalance

Thrusting it between his shoulder blades

The Watusi
The Twist

El Dorado

Take this brother, may it serve you well

Maybe it's nothing
Aaah
Maybe it's nothing
What? What? Oh

[Verse 7]
Maybe even then
Exposure could be difficult thing
It's quick like rush for peace is
Because it's so much
It was like being naked
If you become naked

[Outro]
Hold that line, hold that line!
Block that kick, block that kick!

[Verse 1]
Now it's time to say good night
Good night, sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night, sleep tight

[Bridge]
Dream sweet dreams for me (Dream sweet)
Dream sweet dreams for you (Dream sweet dreams)

[Verse 2]
Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night, sleep tight
Now the moon begins to shine
Good night, sleep tight

[Bridge]
Dream sweet dreams for me (Dream sweet)
Dream sweet dreams for you (Dream sweet dreams)

[Instrumental bridge]
Mmm

[Verse 2]
Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night, sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night, sleep tight

[Bridge]
Dream sweet dreams for me (Dream sweet)
Dream sweet dreams for you (Dream sweet dreams)

[Outro]
Good night
Good night, everybody
Everybody, everywhere
Good night

[Verse 1: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Sheepdog
Standing in the rain
Bullfrog
Doing it again
Some kind of happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think you're something special when you smile?

[Verse 2: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Child-like
No one understands
Jack knife
In your sweaty hands
Some kind of innocence is measured out in years
You don't know what it's like to listen to your fears

[Chorus: John Lennon]
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely you can talk to me

[Verse 3: John Lennon, Paul McCartney & Ringo Starr]
Big man (Yeah)
Walking in the park
Wigwam
Frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is measured out in you
You think you know me but you haven't got a clue

[Chorus: John Lennon]
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely you can talk to me

[Bridge: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Wahoo woof! Woof!
Hey bulldog! Hey bulldog!
Hey bulldog! Hey bulldog!

[Speech: John Lennon]
Hey man, what's that boy?
Woof!
What do you say?
I said "woof!"
You know anymore?
Wooaah ha ha ha!
You've got it, that's it, you had it!
That's it, man, woo!
That's it! You've got it!
Don't look at me man, I only have ten children
Ah ho! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Quiet boy, quiet!
Okay
Quiet!

[Outro: John Lennon & Paul McCartney]
Hey bulldog!
Hey bulldog!

[Intro]
It's all too much
It's all too much

[Verse 1]
When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see

[Chorus]
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much

[Verse 2]
Floating down the stream of time from life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where you'd like to be

[Chorus]
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around here
All the world is birthday cake
So take a piece but not too much

[Verse 3]
Sail me on a silver sun, where I know that I'm free
Show me that I'm everywhere, and get me home for tea

[Chorus]
It's all too much for me to see
The love that's shining all around here
The more I learn, the less I know
But what I do is all too much

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much

[Outro]
It's too much
Ah, it's too much

With your long blond hair and your eyes of blue
With your long blond hair and your eyes of blue

You're too much, ah
We all get too much

Too much, too much, too much
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a, too much a, too much a
Too much a
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much, too much

[Verse 1]
I'm going to tell Aunt Mary about Uncle John
He says he had the misery it but he got a lot of fun
Oh baby
Yeeeah now baby
Woooooh baby

[Verse 2]
I saw Uncle John with long tall Sally
He saw Aunt Mary coming and he ducked back in the alley
Oh baby
Yeeeeah now baby

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
Well long tall Sally built pretty sweet
She got everything that Uncle John needs
Oh baby

[Outro]
Well, we're going to have some fun tonight

Everything's alright
Have some fun tonight
Yeah, we'll have some fun, some fun tonight

[Verse 1]
I call your name but you're not there
Was I to blame for being unfair
Oh I can't sleep at night
Since you've been gone
I never weep at night
I can't go on

[Bridge]
Don't you know I can't take it
I don't know who can
I'm not going to make it
I'm not that kind of man

[Verse 2]
Oh I can't sleep at night
But just the same
I never weep at night
I call your name
Oh!

[Bridge]
Don't you know I can't take it
I don't know who can
I'm not going to make it
I'm not that kind of man

[Verse 2]
Oh I can't sleep at night
But just the same
I never weep at night
I call your name

[Outro]
I call your name
I call your name
Woo, I call your name

[Intro]
Well, come on pretty baby, won't you walk with me?
Come on, pretty baby, won't you talk with me?
Come on pretty baby, give me one more chance
Try to save our romance!

Slow down, baby, now you're moving way too fast
You gotta gimme little lovin', gimme little loving
Ow! If you want our love to last

[Hook]
Well, I used to walk you home, baby, after school
Carry your books home, too
But now you got a boyfriend down the street
Baby what you're trying to do?

You better slow down!
Baby, now you're moving way too fast
You gotta gimme little lovin', gimme little loving
Brrr! If you want our love to last

The best little woman I ever had

Slow down!

You gotta gimme little lovin', gimme little loving
Awe! If you want our love to last

[Outro]

{Intro}

I said I'm sittin' here watchin'
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I said I'm sittin' here wonderin'
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I ain't got no matches but I sure
Got a long way to go

I'm an ole poor boy, and I'm a
Long way from home
I'm an ole poor boy, and I'm a
Long way from home
I've never been happy cause everything I
Ever did was wrong

Well, if you don't want my peaches, honey
Please don't shake my tree
If you don't want any of those peaches honey
Please don't mess around my tree
I got news for you baby
Leave me here in misery
Alright!

{Bridge}

Well, let me be your little dog
Till your big dog comes
Let me be your little dog
Till your big dog comes
And when your big dog gets here
Watch how your puppy dog runs

Well, I said I'm sittin' here watchin'
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I said I'm sittin' here watchin'
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I ain't got no matches but I sure
Got a long way to go

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Try to see it my way
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on?
While you see it your way
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
We can work it out
We can work it out

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Think of what you're saying
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright
Think of what I'm saying
We can work it out and get it straight or say good night

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
We can work it out
We can work it out

[Bridge: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Life is very short and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we might fall apart before too long

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
We can work it out
We can work it out

[Bridge: Paul McCartney & John Lennon]
Life is very short and there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend
I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again

[Verse 4: Paul McCartney]
Try to see it my way
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we might fall apart before too long

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
We can work it out
We can work it out

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Let's all get up and dance to a song
That was a hit before your mother was born
Though she was born a long, long time ago
Your mother should know (Your mother should)
Your mother should know (Know)
Sing it again
Let's all get up and dance to a song
That was a hit before your mother was born
Though she was born a long, long time ago
Your mother should know (Your mother should)
Your mother should know (Know)

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Lift up your hearts and sing me a song
That was a hit before your mother was born
Though she was born a long, long time ago
Your mother should know (Your mother should)
Your mother should know (Know)
Your mother should know (Your mother should)
Your mother should know (Know)

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Sing it again
Da da dada da da da dada dada dada da da
Da dada da da
Though she was born a long, long time ago
Your mother should know (Your mother should)
Your mother should know (Know)
Your mother should know (Your mother should)
Your mother should know (Know)
Your mother should know (Your mother should)
Your mother should know (Know)

[Verse 1]
How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people?
Now that you know who you are
What do you want to be?
And have you traveled very far?
Far as the eye can see

[Verse 2]
How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people?
How often have you been there?
Often enough to know
What did you see when you were there?
Nothing that doesn't show

[Chorus]
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man, too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo
What a thing to do
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man, too

[Verse 3]
How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people?
Tuned to a natural E
Happy to be that way
Now that you've found another key
What are you going to play?

[Chorus]
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man, too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo
What a thing to do
Baby, baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man, too
Oh, baby, you're a rich man
Baby, you're a rich man
Baby, baby you're a rich man, too

[Verse 1]
No one ever saw you moving through the dark
Leaving slips of paper somewhere in the park
Hidden from your friends, stealing all they knew
Love is thrown in airless rooms, then vile rewards for you

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm gonna tell, yes, I've gotta tell
Gotta tell the things you said
When you're talking in the dark
And I'm gonna tell the things you've done
When you're walking through the park

[Chorus 1]
Some night on the thriller’s street
Will come the silent gun
You've got a dangerous heart
You stole their trust, their moon, their sun
There'll come assassin's needle on a crowded train
I bet you feel so lonely you could die

[Verse 2]
Buildings crammed with people, landscapes filled with wrath
Gray concrete city, rain has wet the street
I want to see you clearly before you close the door
A room of bloody history, you made sure of that

[Pre-Chorus]
I can see you as a corpse hanging from a beam
I could read you like a book
I can feel you falling
I hear you moaning in your room
Oh, see if I care
Oh, please, please make it soon

[Chorus 2]
Walls have got you cornered
You've got the blues, my friend
And people don't like you
But you will leave without a sound, without an end
Oblivion shall own you
Death alone shall love you
I hope you feel so lonely you could die
Feel so lonely you could die
You feel so lonely you could die

[Verse 1]
Everyday in the week, I'm in a different city
If I stay too long, the people try to pull me down
They talk about me like a dog, talk about the clothes I wear
But they don't realize they're the ones who's square

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, and that's why you can't hold me down
I don't want to be down
I got to move on
Aw!

[Chorus]
Stone free, to do what I please
Stone free, to ride the breeze
Stone free, I can't stay
I got to, got to, got to get away right now
Yeah, alright

[Verse 2]
Listen to this baby
A woman here, a woman there, try to keep me in a plastic cage
But they don't realize it's so easy to break
Oh but sometimes I can, ha
I can feel my heart kind of running hot
That's when I got to move, before I get caught

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, and that's why, listen to me baby, you can't hold me down
I don't want to be tied down
I got to be free
Aw!

[Chorus]
I said
Stone free, to do what I please
Stone free, to ride the breeze
Stone free, I can't stay
I got to, got to, got to get away
Yeah, aw
Turn me loose baby

[Guitar solo]
Yeah, aw!
Uh huh, yeah!

[Chorus]
I said
Stone free, to ride the breeze
Stone free, to do what I please
Stone free, I can't stay
I got to, got to, got to, got to get away

[Outro]
Stone free
I'm gonna leave right now
Stone free
Don't turn on me back
Stone free
I'm going on down the highway, yeah
Stone free
Got to, got to, got to, got to, got to
Stone free
Ooh hell, bye bye baby
Stone free
Aw

[Verse 1-Jimi Hendrix]
Lord, I feel the ocean swaying me
Washing away all my pain
See where I used to be wounded
Remember the scar?
Now you can't see a thing
And I don't feel no pain, no, no

[Chorus-Jimi Hendrix]
Singing about the Valleys of Sunrise
Green and blue canyons, too
Singing about Atlantis love songs
The Valleys of Neptune is rising, rising, rising

[Verse 2-Jimi Hendrix]
Mercury liquid, emerald's shining
Now showing me where I came from, baby
Honey sun, turquoise bed he lays in
On the burning edge horizon
I'm sailing on a bluebird's mission
Bubbles and curls and tiptoes in the foam
See the wind make love to all the ocean
Tidal waves spread, and the message got home
And the message got home

[Chorus-Jimi Hendrix]
Singing about the Valley of Sunsets...
Purple and gold... the Armies of the Lord
Before ancient Egypt, there were moon trips...
The Valleys of Neptune is arising -

[Verse 3-Jimi Hendrix]
Look out east coast, but you're going to have a neighbor
A rebirth land, home of the praying hands​
We know there were kinds, so much older
And they shall rise, and tell us much more the truth of man
I see visions of sleeping peaks erupting
Releasing all hell that will shake the Earth from end to end

[Outro-Jimi Hendrix]
And this isn't bad news, good news, or any news
It's just the truth, better save your souls while you can

Singing about the New Valleys
Of the Sunrise... Rainbow clean
The world is gonna be...
Singing about getting ready for the new tide...
The Valleys of Neptune is arising

[Verse 1]
Ridin' in the drop top with the top down
Saw you switchin' lanes girl
Pull up to the red light, lookin' right
Come here, let me get your name girl
Tell me where you from, what you do, what you like
Let me pick your brain girl
And tell me how they got that pretty little face on that pretty little frame girl
But let me show you 'round, let me take you out
Bet you we could we could have some fun girl
Cause we can do it fast (fast), slow, whichever way you wanna run girl
But let me buy you drinks, better yet rings
Do it how you want it done girl
And who would've thought that you could be the one cause I

[Chorus]
I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me
This just can't be summer love, you'll see
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E)

[Verse 2]
Come on and lemme show you 'round
Let me take you out, bet you we could have some fun girl
'Cause we can dress it up, we can dress it down
Any way you want it done girl
Or we can stay home, talkin' on the phone
Rappin' 'til we see the sun girl
Do what I gotta do, just gotta show you that I'm the one girl
Well I'mma freak you right, each and every night
I know how to do it insane girl
Cause I can make it hot, make it stop
Make you wanna say my name girl
Come on baby please cause I'm on my knees
Can't get you off my brain girl
But who would've thought that you could be the one cause I

[Chorus]
I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me
This just can't be summer love, you'll see
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E)
Cause I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me
This just can't be summer love, you'll see
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E)

[Bridge]
The summer's over for the both of us
But that doesn't mean we should give up on love
You're the one I've been thinking of
And I knew the day I met you you'd be the one

[Chorus]
I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me
This just can't be summer love, you'll see
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E)
Cause I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me
This just can't be summer love, you'll see
This just can't be summer love (L-O-V-E)

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Alright now
Won't you listen?
When I first met you, didn't realize
I can't forget you or your surprise
You introduced me to my mind
And left me wanting you and your kind
Oh, yeah!

[Verse 2]
I love you
Oh, you know it
My life was empty, forever on a down
Until you took me, showed me around
My life is free now, my life is clear
I love you, sweet leaf
Though you can't hear
Oh, yeah!

[Verse 3]
Come on now
Try it out
Straight people don't know
What you're about
They put you down and shut you out
You gave to me a new belief
And soon the world
Will love you, sweet leaf
Oh, yeah, baby!

[Outro]
Come on now! Oh, yeah!
Try me out, baby! Alright!
Oh, yeah-ah
I want you part of this sweet leaf
Oh, yeah! Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh-oh, try me out
I love you, sweet leaf, oh

[Verse 1]
I fly like paper, get high like planes
If you catch me at the border I got visas in my name
If you come around here, I make 'em all day
I get one done in a second if you wait
I fly like paper, get high like planes
If you catch me at the border I got visas in my name
If you come around here, I make 'em all day
I get one done in a second if you wait

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I think sittin' on trains
Every stop I get to I'm clocking that game
Everyone's a winner we're making our fame
Bonafide hustler making my name
Sometimes I think sittin' on trains
Every stop I get to I'm clocking that game
Everyone's a winner we're making our fame
Bonafide hustler making my name

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Man I'm rollin' through the city, old school on them big boys
12 inch woofers in the trunk making big noise
Got the big toys (toys), dont make me have to flash
Let a hundred rounds go, you do a hundred yard dash
Back up in the hood where the rules dont shift
And the gangstas talk trills, sip purp and burn piff
You can call 5-0 and 5-0 might come
But by the time that they arrive all that dirt had been done
Now one things for certain, and two things for sure
Being poor is a disease, gotta hustle up a cure
Start with your head homie then use your hands
If you try it in reverse, you dont even have a chance
We worldwide worried with the hunger and the thirst
From the third world countries to the second and the first
It sounds like a verse but its more like a plan
Get your Robin Hood on, put some pressure on the man, tell it!

[Verse 4: Rich Boy]
I wake up in the morning with my bitch in the bed
She don't like the police and she sure hate the feds
I love my girl cause she gives me what I want
She ride in the trunk or either ride in the front
She looks like 22 but she really 45
Some reason she done made a whole lotta niggas cry
So bad that she make ‘em all pull they money out
Take it out they pockets and they put it in my pouch
Ouch! gotta hurt the way that girl do ya
She always wanna what take, take, take the moolah
Gimmie them pesos the cash and the credit card
Might be a broad but the lil' bitch hit ya hard

You need more than them helicopters to stop us
Excuse me, let me introduce my lady
Her name is Beretta and she mothafuckin crazy!

[Chorus]
If I could take away the pain and put a smile on your face
Baby I would, baby I would
If I could make a better way so you could see a better day
Baby I would, baby I would

[Verse 1]
I would build a doorway to the sky and hand you the keys, yeah
Let you know that you're always welcome so that you never leave, oh
Buy you all those fancy things that you only see on TV, yeah
Run away to a hideaway, we'd be living the American Dream

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's never gonna be that easy
But I know that it won't hurt us to try, oh

[Chorus]
If I could take away the pain and put a smile on your face
Baby I would, baby I would
If I could make a better way so you could see a better day
Baby I would, baby I would

[Verse 2]
I would build the love of river wide so that it never runs dry, yeah
Any time you ask me why I'm smiling, say that I'm satisfied
You got your flaws and so do I, past lovers that made you cry
And though I wanna make it right, I just can't read your mind, no

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's never gonna be that easy
But I know that it won't hurt us to try, oh

[Chorus]
If I could take away the pain and put a smile on your face
Baby I would, baby I would
If I could make a better way so you could see a better day
Baby I would, baby I would

[Bridge]
Yeah, it's not about what I want, it's all about what you need
I know that he hurt you, but that wasn't me
And I know and I know sometimes it's hard to see
That I'm where you need to be, oh

[Chorus]
If I could take away the pain and put a smile on your face
Baby I would, baby I would
If I could make a better way so you could see a better day
Baby I would, baby I would

[Verse 1]
I'm walking through the summer nights
The jukebox playing low
Yesterday everything was going too fast
Today it's moving too slow
I got no place left to turn
I got nothing left to burn
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow

[Refrain]
You left me standing in the doorway, crying
I got nothing to go back to now

[Verse 2]
The light in this place is so bad
Making me sick in the head
All the laughter is just making me sad
The stars have turned cherry red
I'm strumming on my gay guitar
Smoking a cheap cigar
The ghost of our old love has not gone away
Don't look it like it will anytime soon

[Refrain]
You left me standing in the doorway, crying
Under the midnight moon

[Verse 3]
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't
But not tonight and it won't be here
There are things I could say, but I don't
I know the mercy of God must be near
I've been riding a midnight train
Got ice water in my veins
I would be crazy if I took you back
It would go up against every rule

[Refrain]
You left me standing in the doorway, crying
Suffering like a fool

[Verse 4]
When the last rays of daylight go down
Buddy, you’ll roll no more
I can hear the church bells ringing in the yard
I wonder who they're ringing for
I know I can't win
But my heart just won't give in
Last night I danced with a stranger
But she just reminded me you were the one

[Refrain]
You left me standing in the doorway, crying
In the dark land of the sun

[Verse 5]
I eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry
And live my life on the square
And even if the flesh falls off of my face
I know someone will be there to care
It always means so much
Even the softest touch
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation
There's no words that need to be said

[Refrain]
You left me standing in the doorway, crying
Blues wrapped around my head

[Verse 1]
Lemme tell a lil' story, about this dude I knew, he said -
Used to go to school out in L.I.U, he said -
He'd make me a bet, he'd own his own jet, and he'd
Show me the city,from a bird's eye view, said he -
Came from Jamaica, he had a lil' paper
He owned a couple acres, and then I caught the vapors
That's how we got together, on the bike -
Late night, Kawasaki leathers (Ah huh!) He used to -
Wine and dine me,dom and sex and we be -
Arm and armor, 'Mani dress and see I ain't need
A leprechaun, or four leaf clover, I just -
Woke up one morning,and he copped the Rover, see? -
I knew about them girls, he had back then, but -
I was getting money, I ain't care bout them, cause -
They was getting G's, I had M's, I used to -
Split my dividends, with all my friends, cause -
I was in the lounge, they was in the Greyhound, like -
In and out of town,moving coke by the pound, like
Guess it didn't sound right, cause them bitches was mad -
Started plotting, trying to get what I had, see -
My homegirl Teisha, said that Keisha with the  -
Real black lips, used to smoke that reefer, some -
Bitch, named Dawn, used to fuck LaiQwan and
Alicia with the chinky eyes, used to be with freaky Ty
Lived across the street, from this nigga named Tiki Diamond
Yeah, chicken noodle bitches, like a pack of Ramen
They had it out for me, kidnapped my brother
At the rucker, cause he used to put it down for me

[Talking: Nicki Minaj]
Oh my God, they caught Brandon, I got his picture in the mail
He was rocking a Vanson, the note said
"Bitch, we got surveillance on the mansion and we gonna need thirty million for the ransom"

[Talking: man]

To be continued...

[Verse 1]
Under constant correction, a fraud, a fraud
Someone's perception, trying not to bore
I'm a cold-hearted kidder, applaud, applaud
If you're the highest bidder, I'm yours
You think we have pathetic sets
And we're not sure of the etiquette
Although we know they're pathetic sets
And we're not sure of the etiquette

[Chorus]
And if you found this, it's probably too late
Clinically cynical, hereditary hate
If you found this, it's probably too late
Approaching the pinnacle, I'm running out of mates

[Verse 2]
If we concentrate on being off the cuff
Not sure we're ready, but probably rough
Frightened that honesty isn't enough
And it's nothing on the early stuff

[Verse 1]
Summer days, summer nights are gone
Summer days and the summer nights are gone
I know a place where there’s still something going on
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs all out in the mud
I got a long-haired woman, she got royal Indian blood
Everybody get ready to lift up your glasses and sing
Everybody get ready to lift up your glasses and sing
Well, I’m standing on the table, I’m proposing a toast to the king
Well I’m driving in the flats in a Cadillac car
The girls all say, “You’re a worn-out star”
My pockets are loaded and I’m spending every dime
How can you say you love someone else when you know it’s me all the time?

[Verse 2]
Well, the fog’s so thick you can’t spy the land
The fog is so thick that you can’t even spy the land
What good are you, anyway, if you can’t stand up to some old businessman?
Wedding bells are ringing, the choir is beginning to sing
Yes, the wedding bells are ringing and the choir's beginning to sing
What looked good in the day, at night is another thing
She’s looking into my eyes, she’s-a holding my hand
She looking into my eyes, she’s holding my hand
She said, “You can’t repeat the past.” I said, “You can’t? What do you mean
You can’t? Of course you can.”
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
Sorry, that’s nothing you would need to know
Well, my back has been to the wall for so long, it seems like it’s stuck
Why don’t you break my heart one more time just for good luck?

[Verse 3]
I got eight carburetors, boys, I’m using ’em all
Well, I got eight carburetors and, boys, I’m using ’em all
I’m short on gas, my motor’s starting to stall
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around
My dogs are barking, there's must be someone around
I got my hammer ringing, pretty baby, but the nails ain’t going down
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace
If it’s information you want, you can get it from the police
Politician's got on his jogging shoes
He must be running for office, got no time to lose
He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity
You been rolling your eyes—you been teasing me

[Verse 4]
Standing by God’s river, my soul is beginning to shake
Standing by God’s river, my soul's beginning to shake
I’m counting on you, love, to give me a break
Well, I’m leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift
Yes, I’m leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift
Gon' break the roof in, set fire to the place as a parting gift
Summer days, summer nights are gone
Summer days, summer nights are gone
I know a place where there’s still something going on

[Verse 1]
Started from the bottom now we here
We were sellin’ things, pullin' strings - puppeteer
Started with a dollar now I’m jumping out the Lear
All my niggas behind me, you can find me in the air
In the car smokin’ loud on my way to Mr. Chow’s
I say: “ain’t it funny now, nigga, this bracelet’s fifty thou”
He say he gon’ hit me, how? I keep shooters all around me
Quicker-picker-up your bitch, that pussy wet and I be Bounty
I got all these haters frontin’ just from lookin’ at my pictures
Plottin’ on my Instagram, they wanna follow me like Twitter
On my way home…
But I’mma hit her, did I mention, 30 grand’ll get you gone
You’ll come up missing ‘cause my cake long
Where your real friends at?
Hold up, fuck that, nigga, where your girlfriend at?
She probably in the VIP where all her girlfriends at
She know that you be hatin’ on me and I still hit that, damn
You gon’ need a green card for the Cuban link (ouch)
Cancel my account, I’ll probably move the bank
When you see them hammers out you’d best not move a blink
FN57, fuck around, shoot through a tank
Bitch, shake that ass, go on, shake them titties
Bitch, shake that ass like you work at Magic City
I be bustin’ bottles, ain’t talkin’ ‘bout with Drizzy
Probably be with OVO and I be in Toronto city
With yo fake ass, and yo fake weed
Frontin’ on a real nigga, bitch say cheese
And put your flash on just to catch the AP
Diamonds thunderin’ all in that bitch, I call it KD
Hold up – hold up, wait a minute, y’all thought I was finished?
I popped twenty bottles, that was just a scrimmage
Nigga, you ain’t ballin’, you pop twenty and you finished
Got you fuckin’ up your re-up every time we in the building
‘Cause we started from the bottom now we here
Sippin’ Rosé with Rozay and it’s Belaire
I signed with MMG and did it in a year
I started with a circle and I turned it to a square, ya dig?

[Intro]
Yeah
This on some old Tommy Campos Dice Raw shit, you know?
For my niggas, though

[Verse]
Uh, you underestimated greatly
Most number ones ever, how long did it really take me?
The part I love most is they need me more than they hate me
So they never take shots, I got everybody on safety
I could load every gun with bullets that fire backwards
Probably wouldn't lose a single rapper
Niggas make threats, can't hear 'em over the laughter
Yeah, that's 'cause I'm headed to the bank, nigga
Sinatra lifestyle, I'm just bein' frank with ya
I mean, where you think she at when she ain't with ya?
Wildin', doin' shit that's way out of your budget
Owl sweaters inside her luggage, you gotta love it
Damn, this shit could go on a tape
Bitches lovin' my drive, I never give it a break
Give these niggas the look, the verse, and even the hook
That's why every song sound like Drake featurin' Drake
Str8, Y pree? Why is it always me?
Got us watchin' our words like it's wiretaps on the team
'Cause I show love, never get the same outta niggas
Guess it's funny how money can make change outta niggas
For real, some nobody started feelin' himself
A couple somebodies started killin' themself
A couple albums dropped, those are still on the shelf
I bet them shits would have popped if I was willin' to help
I got a gold trophy from the committee for validation
Bad press during the summer over allegations
I ain't lyin', my nigga, my time is money
That's why I ain't got time for a nigga whose time is coming
A lot of niggas PR stuntin' like that's the movement
And I'm the only nigga still known for the music, I swear
Fuck them niggas this year, I made Forbes list, nigga
Fuck your list, everything's lookin' gorgeous
Without me, rap is just a bunch of orphans
But if I stay, then this shit is a bunch of corpses
And me and my dread nigga from New Orleans
Stashin' money like hoarders off multi-platinum recordings
Eatin' like I’m seated at Swish, Sotto, and Joso's
Nothing Was The Same, this shit for Ezee and Coco
This shit for Karim, this shit for Jaevon
This shit for Julius, Milly Mill, boy, we do this shit for real
All them boys in my will, all them boys is my Wills
Anything happen to pop, then I got you like Uncle Phil
Weezy been on that edge, you niggas just need to chill
If anything happen to Papi, might pop a nigga for real
Comin' live from the screwface, livin' out a suitcase
But I'm feelin' good, Johnny got me pushin' two plates
My weight up, I refused to wait up, I started a new race
It's funny when you think a nigga blew up after Lupe
Niggas treat me like I've been here for 10
Some niggas been here for a couple, never been here again
I'm on my King James shit, I'm tryna win here again
A young nigga tryna win here again, man, what's up?

[Outro]
Ayy, yeah, a young nigga tryin' to win here again
If I like her, I just fly her to the city I'm in
I got her drinkin' with your boy
I got her fucked up, shorty, aww yeah

[Intro x2]
Since a shorty I was 40 and my 40's is like 80's
So by the time I die, I'm gon' be a baby

[Hook]
And so my youth sound just like lightning coming down
See my youth sound just like lightning coming down
And my youth sound just like lightning coming down
And my youth sound just like lightning coming down

[Verse 1]
From my view here, my hue veers
To a blue smeer on a white wall, what you might call my blue period
I'm two-tiered, but no tats, and I don't know what you call that
Goes on and on like two mirrors
And if you see us then you read properly then your heart knows
And your head copies
My two tears, ain't no dead bodies
They my entendres and I'm hungry
So my piece of the pie better be as big as Mahatma Gandhi's
Even my filler kills, my 13th just might be a zombie
So thrilling at bringing all that filling back
So if you died lately, put your trust in the cry baby
Free man don't drive Daisy, but that light I shed so hydrate

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
In my hot rod with my Vans on and my hand bone
And my hair long and my circle tight and my square strong
I'm in great shape with no shake-weights
Or no weight shakes and tell your mama this cake's great
Cake cake cake cake cake cake cake
And not Rihanna, my cake's paper, I rage in Harlem
I paper bait
And I take it back, cashes, asses, autograph it
Before I leave like Cassius Clay
In that big ole car, that bass shake that little bars
So my bass tape and that Drake Go, if ya wanna wake-o then Jaco’s!
Where the cake go? I blew all that for this great flow
Wish a nigga would step on this Pergo that I paid for

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Red lights, obey my headlights
That head red like peg, or Santa's sled lights
That mean I heard what she said 'fo she said what she said outta head
It's like I got a head mic'd
Like a Fed might, but I ain't fed like
Been a hands on homie, my head right
Dreadlocks, but no Red Stripe and that both ours like red bike
And the Feds know what I roll like
In a dead man, with some low-lifes
Me stopped, then your lights
I got no lights 'til the stop-sign
I got no rights like Nascar
Or a black man in the deep south
During Jim Crow with the police
That's 99 problems with a ho twice
From no life to Frankenstein, got it stitched up I'm so nice

[Hook]

[Skit: De'Ray Davis]
You keep it going, man, you keep those books rolling
You pick up all those books that you're gonna read and not remember and you roll, man
You get that associate's degree, okay?
Then you get your bachelor's
Then you get your masters
Then you get your masters' masters
Then you get your doctorate
You go, man
And then, when everybody says quit, you show them those degrees, man
When everyone says, "Hey, you're not working, you're not making any money"
You say, "You look at my degrees, and you look at my life
Yeah, I'm fifty-two, so what?
Hate all you want, but I'm smart, I'm so smart
And, and I'm in school
All these guys out here, uh, making money all these ways
And I'm spending mine to be smart
You know why?
'Cause when I die, buddy
You know what's gonna keep me warm?
That's right, those degrees"

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please, tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door

[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"

[Verse 2]
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so

[Bridge]
Oh, back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?

[Chorus]
'Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said, "Forever and always"
And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"

[Outro]
You didn't mean it baby
You said, "Forever and always", yeah

[Verse 1]
I took a chance, I took a shot
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
You took a swing, I took it hard
And down here from the ground I see who you are

[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me, then cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when you're around
And here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know, that you see, what you're doing to me
Tell me why

[Verse 2]
You could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day
Well, I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what I'm trying to say, oh

[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me, then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know, that you see, what you're doing to me
Tell me why

[Bridge]
Why do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside?
Why do you have to put down my dreams
So you're the only thing on my mind?

[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you want me, then cut me down
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I've got no one to believe in
You ask me for my love, then you push me around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why (Why)
Tell me why (Why)

[Outro]
I take a step back, let you go
I told you I'm not bulletproof
Now you know

[Verse 1]
He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine

[Chorus]
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

[Verse 2]
He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable

[Chorus]
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

[Bridge]
He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating
Intoxicating, complicated
Got away by some mistake and now

[Chorus]
I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh

[Outro]
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh
Never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Don't be so quick to walk away
Dance with me
I wanna rock your body
Please stay
Dance with me
You don't have to admit you wanna play
Dance with me
Just let me rock you
Till the break of day
Dance with me

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
Guy time, but I don't mind
Just wanna rock you, girl
I'll have whatever you have
Come on, just give it a whirl
See, I've been watching you
I like the way you move
So go ahead, girl, just do
That ass shaking thing you do

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
So you grab your girls
And you grab a couple more
And you all come meet me
In the middle of the floor
Said the air is thick, it's smelling right
So you pass to the left and you sail to the right

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Don't be so quick to walk away
Dance with me
I wanna rock your body
Please stay
Dance with me
You don't have to admit you wanna play
Dance with me
Just let me rock you
Till the break of day
Dance with me

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
I don't mean no harm
Just wanna rock you, girl
Make a move, but be calm
Let's go, let's give it a whirl
See, it appears to me
You like the way I move
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
Pull you close and share my groove

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
So you grab your girls
And you grab a couple more
And you all come meet me
In the middle of the floor
Said the air is thick, it's smelling right
So you pass to the left and you sail to the right

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Don't be so quick to walk away
Dance with me
I wanna rock your body
Please stay
Dance with me
You don't have to admit you wanna play
Dance with me
Just let me rock you
Till the break of day
Dance with me

[Post-Chorus: Vanessa Marquez & Justin Timberlake]
Talk to me, boy
No disrespect, I don't mean no harm
Talk to me, boy
I can't wait to have you in my arms
Talk to me, boy
Hurry up 'cause you're taking too long
Talk to me, boy
Bet I'll have you naked by the end of this song

[Bridge: Vanessa Marquez, Justin Timberlake and Both]
So what did you come for?
I came to dance with you
And you know that you don't wanna hit the floor
I came to romance with you
You're searching for love forever more
It's time to take a chance
If love is here on the floor, girl

[Interlude: Justin Timberlake]
Hey
Dance with me
Yeah
Come on, baby

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Don't be so quick to walk away
(Don't walk away)
(Come on and)
Dance with me
I wanna rock your body
(Let me rock your body)
Please stay
Come on and
Dance with me
You don't have to admit you wanna play
(You don't have to admit you wanna play, just)
Dance with me
Just let me rock you
(Do do do do)
Till the break of day
(Come on and)
Dance with me

[Post-Chorus: Vanessa Marquez & Justin Timberlake]
Talk to me, boy
No disrespect, I don't mean no harm
Talk to me, boy
But I can't wait to have you in my arms
Talk to me, boy
Hurry up 'cause you're taking too long
(Come on baby)
Talk to me, boy
Bet I'll have you naked by the end of this song

[Beatbox Solo]

[Breakdown: Justin Timberlake]
Don't be so quick to walk away
(Just think of me and you)
Don't be so quick to walk away
(We could do something)
Don't be so quick to walk away
(I like the way you look right now)
Don't be so quick to walk away
(Come over here baby)

[Outro: Justin Timberlake]
Are you feeling me?
Let's do something
Let's make a bet
'Cause I, gotta have you naked by the end of this song

[Intro: Pharrell Williams & Justin Timberlake]
Ladies and gentlemen
It's my pleasure to introduce to you
He's a friend of mine
Yes, yes I am
And he goes by the name... Justin
Wooo
All the way from Memphis, Tennessee
And he's got somethin' special for y'all tonight
He's gonna sing a song for y'all about this girl
Come in right here?
Yeah, come on

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake & Pharrell Williams]
On that sunny day
Didn't know I'd meet
Such a beautiful girl
Walking down the street
Seen those bright brown eyes
With tears coming down (So he said to himself)
She deserves a crown
But where is it now?
Mama, listen

[Chorus 1: Justin Timberlake]
Señorita, I feel for you
You deal with things, that you don't have to
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
But you could feel this real love
If you just lay in my...

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Running fast in my mind
Girl, don't you slow it down
If we carry on this way
This thing might leave the ground
How would you like to fly?
That's how my queen should ride
But you still deserve the crown
Or hasn't it been found?
Mama, listen

[Chorus 1: Justin Timberlake]
Señorita, I feel for you (Feel for you)
You deal with things, that you don't have to
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm (He don't love ya, baby)
But you could feel this real love (Feel it)
If you just lay in my...

[Chorus 2]
Ah, ah, arms
(Won't you lay in my)
Ah, ah, arms
(Mama, lay in my)
Ah, ah, arms
(Baby, won't you lay in my)
Ah, ah, arms

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
When I look into your eyes (Just listen, baby)
I see something that money can't buy (Just hear me, baby, oh)
And I know if you give us a try (I want you, girl)
I'll work harder for you girl (Whoa, oh)
And no longer will you ever have to...

[Chorus 1: Justin Timberlake]
(... cry) Señorita, I feel for you (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You deal with things (Deal with things), that you don't have to
(Don't have to, oh)
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
But you could feel this real love (Feel it)

[Chorus 2: Justin Timberlake]
If you just lay in my...
Ah, ah, arms
Ah, ah, arms
(Mama, lay in my)
Ah, ah, arms (Yeah)
Ah, ah, arms

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
When I look into your eyes (Just listen, baby)
I see something that money can't buy (Just hear me, baby, oh)
And I know if you give us a try (I want you, girl)
I'll work harder for you girl (Whoa, oh)
And no longer will you ever have to cry

[Interlude: Justin Timberlake]
Now listen
I wanna try somethin' right now
See, they don't do this anymore
I'mma sing something
And I want the guys to sing with me
They go:
"It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?"
And then the ladies go:
"I don't know what I'm thinking 'bout, really leaving with you"
Guys sing:
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?
And ladies:
"I don't know what I'm thinking 'bout, really leaving with you"
Feels good, don't it? Come on
"It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?"
Yeah, ladies
"I don't know what I'm thinking 'bout, really leaving with you"
(Show the good in me)
Sing it one more time:
"It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?"
And ladies:
"I don't know what I'm thinking 'bout, really leaving with you"
"It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?"
Ladies:
"I don't know what I'm thinking 'bout, really leaving with you"

[Outro: Justin Timberlake]
Gentlemen, goodnight
Ladies, good morning
And that's it

[Verse 1]
"Welcome to the real world", she said to me
Condescendingly
Take a seat, take your life
Plot it out in black and white
Well I never lived the dreams of the prom kings
And the drama queens
I'd like to think the best of me
Is still hiding up my sleeve

[Pre-Chorus]
They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side

[Chorus]
I want to run through the halls of my high school
I want to scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

[Verse 2]
So the good boys and girls take the so called right track
Faded white hats, grabbing credits and
Maybe transfers
They read all the books, but they can't find the answers
And all of our parents, they're getting older
I wonder if they've wished for anything better
While in their memories, tiny tragedies

[Pre-Chorus]
They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side

[Chorus]
I want to run through the halls of my high school
I want to scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

[Bridge]
I am invincible
I am invincible
I am invincible
As long as I'm alive

[Chorus]
I want to run through the halls of my high school
I want to scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above
I just can't wait 'til my ten year reunion
I'm going to bust down the double doors
And when I stand on these tables before you
You will know what all this time was for

[Intro]
Morey Boogie Board shit
Off the coast
Sand bars
Bam Bam

[Verse 1]
I got the mental of the Bad Lieutenant
We gamble drug money, riverboats, Cadillacs
Talkin' 'bout a prison note
Lemon zest is subtle in the fish they call the cuttle
We grew up in the gutter break your jaw like a huddle
Morey boogie boards wax the top so we stay on
Wrist strap is pitch black, 360 shades on
I won't stop until the wall's got Monet's drawn
The farmland and other animals to graze on
I'm always smoking on the potent straight from Oakland
I'm rising like a soufflé, you know you gotta serve it quick
Just dust me off with cheese, pussy straight from Persia bitch
They'll find your leg in Maine, your torso out in Jersey snitch
I rock the lenses Caminiti wore
I roll a fifty of the dour to the neck and take a city tour
Any genre got the salsa and the gritty raw
Timeless, my mother's diamonds 1954

[Hook x2]
I gotta get that dough, I want the Beamer with the racing seats
Pound the ground with my feet to make the pavement speak
And tell me secrets that she's never told a soul to
The price of living your decisions could control you

Yeah Bronsolino
Queens
Real shit
Queens

[Verse 2]
I sign my name like I'm Mantle, never sticking to the script
Be with people off the boat, seven languages and shit
Bring tradition to the street, get you lifted off your feet
Like my daughter at the park, no taking orders after dark
Cause they expect it
So wake up early, hop off the shitter
Employ a lawyer that's been bar mitzvahed
Never trust a goyim, see me sippin' spritzer, hookers with Spitzer
And Mr. Wedge, 30 dollars hollers never tip her
This condensation that be building in the weed jar is bothersome
Half of my leg covered with Robinson's
The FernGully in this dutch, me and Steele smokin'
Jail letters, pretty bitches gettin' peeled open

[Hook x2]

[Intro: Vince Staples & Earl Sweatshirt]
"What's up, nigga? Why you so depressed and sad all the time like a little bitch? What's the problem, man? Niggas want to hear you rap. Don't nobody care about how you feel, we want- we want raps, nigga."
"Raps?"

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt & Vince Staples]
My grandma's passing
But I'm too busy tryna get this fuckin' album crackin' to see her
So I apologize in advance if anything should happen (Cut that bitch off!)
And my priorities fucked up, I know it, I'm afraid I'm gonna blow it
And when them expectations raising because daddy was a poet, right?
Talk all you want, I'm takin' no advice, nigga
I'm 'bout to relish in this anguish, and I'm stressin' over payment (Cut that bitch off!)
So don't tell me that I made it, only relatively famous
In the midst of a tornado, misfitted, I'm Clark Gable
I'm not stable, (I'm not stable) abrasive as fuck and they all (Cut that bitch off!)
Pay me, I'm chuckling cross-faded in public
Heart racin' 'til blunt is lit, (Like he don't give a fuck again, right?)

[Interlude: Vince Staples]
"Hey Thebe, nigga, what's up nigga? I heard you back, I need them raps, nigga. I need the verse, I don't care about what you going through or what you gotta do nigga, I need bars, sixteen of 'em."

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
I don't fuck with too much of y'all's shit
Judgin' by the pants and the mall grip
Gully, in the vans with the dark tints
I'm a start-shit type nigga (Cut that bitch off!)
Night life livin'
Ridin' in the Jeep, I'mma side-swipe niggas
What's your life like? That's alright nigga
Hammer in the left ready when the price isn't
Right got the whip and I ain't got the license for it
And Jill got me living like my life is golden
Sitting on the sofa feeling high and dormant
If we could smoke another while the mic records it (Cut that bitch off!)
The nicest doin' it, who the fuck you staring at?
Acting like you've never seen a tooth that's carat-capped
Bars hotter than the blocks where we be at
Stuntin' these niggas gon' flop like Divac
See that nigga? And for the time being
I'mma be that nigga, believe that nigga
You see that nigga? And for the time being
I'mma be that nigga, believe that, nigga (Cut that bitch off!)

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
Promise Heron I'll put my fist up, after I get my dick sucked
Quick buck, maybe a gold chain
With that fuckin' flow that's-s so belittles, man
They tentatively tend to turn and go when I am finished
Stone cold, hardly fucking with these niggas – nigga, listen
The description doesn't fit, if not a synonym of menace
Then forget it – in turn, these critics and interns
Admittin' the shit spitted, just burn like six furnaces
Writ, it affixed, learnin' them digits and simultaneously
Dispellin' one-trick-pony myths, isn't he?
One adolescent, fuckin' six-nigga energy
And crawlin' down 'fax like a rich nigga centipede
Crack ceramic and slap a hand out of cash account
Stamp and shoutin', thrashin', these niggas done let the kraken out
Crack-a-lackin' like snap, crackle, poppin' your ammo off
Hide your face, and throw your flannels off, Sweatshirt, nigga

[Chorus: Casey Veggies & Earl Sweatshirt]
'87 rooftop, Bronson
Whippin' hoopties, tryna boost raw chronic
Brutus in that booth, double scoop, hock, vomit up
Subrocin' thud, knockin' niggas teeth-loose
Bruh, I don't fuck with no cop – rollin' with that flow swamp
Catch me over stove top – rappin' to that coke rock
Passionless in old Jive clothin', with them doors wide open
Dim the floor lights, focused like it's nothin', 'cause it's nothin', bitch

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
From a city that's recession-hit
Stress niggas could flex metal with peddle to rake pennies in
Desolate testaments, tryin' to stay Jekyll-ish
But most niggas Hyde, and Brenda just stay pregnant
Breakin' News: Death's less important when the Lakers lose
It's lead in that baby food, heads try to make it through
Fish-netted legs for them eyes that she cater to
Ride dirty as the fuckin' sky that you prayin' to
So here I sit, eye in the pyramid
God spit it like it's truth serum in that beer and then
*blow* – disappear again, reappear bearded
On top of a Lear, steerin' it into the kid's ear again
Provider of the backdrop music
For the crack rock user and the mascot, Earl
Rawer than a skinned knee cap on a blacktop
Salivary glands, lighter fluid for the matchbox
Strikin' – wait, wait, who the fuck you badder than?
Boy, oh boy, I'm bad as burnt – pollo off the grill and shit
Spitter of the Little Nick, nimble, rickrollin'
Bitch niggas pick litter, piff-blower, plus I pillage shit

[Chorus: Casey Veggies & Earl Sweatshirt]
'87 rooftop, Bronson
Whippin' hoopties, tryna boost raw chronic
Brutus in that booth, double scoop, hock, vomit up
Subrocin' thud, knockin' niggas teeth-loose
Bruh, I don't fuck with no cop – rollin' with that flow swamp
Catch me over stove top – rappin' to that coke rock
Passionless in old Jive clothin', with them doors wide open
Dim the floor lights, focused like it's nothin', 'cause it's nothin', bitch

[Verse 3: Vince Staples]
Quit with all that tough talk
Bro, we know you niggas ain't about shit
Come around, we gun 'em down
Bodies piled, Auschwitz
Bulletproof outfits, weapons concealed
I'm ready to kill – so test it, all my weapons is real
Sellin' thizz, couldn't tell 'em what the recipe is
Got 'em wishin' that they never gave these weapons to kids
Cheers, send chills up spines of fat bitches
After shows throwin' out sandwiches
Niggas get it how they live and I live for money
Other words, I'm gettin' money
Lil Boy told me when it's time to ride, they'll send up for me
Ain't nobody scarin' me, niggas ain't prepared for heat
Tools hit like pool sticks, the way I cue shit
If this was '88, I would have signed to Ruthless
'94, would've had 'em walkin' down death row
First is when the best go, hate is what the rest do
Voice inside my head told me, "Wet 'em if they test you"
So it's Raging Waters season
That yomper big as Larry Johnson, leave your momma seedless
Everybody hard until it's only God they seein'
Kitten soft but in they songs be trappin' hard as Jeezy
I don't believe it, but to each his own
I ain't trippin' long as I can reach the chrome
Heat your home like Southern California Gas, police pass
Tell 'em "Free Smalls," off Palm with the heat drawn
Strapped up long as the chief of police armed
Raised where the beasts are, north of the Beach
A couple streets past Baby J, bony niggas sprayin' K's
Ruger with the pork face, Jewish for the court case
Here to save you niggas from the sorbet, Coldchain

[Outro: Casey Veggies]
Like it's nothin', 'cause it's nothin', bitch
How many cars on the drive are actually yours?
You never go out for a ride, you keep them indoors
You got a big big mouth, a big big house
You're the king of cribs right now

A real big hit, no hard shit
I swear that won't change me one bit
Cause I wish I was someone else
Anybody else so maybe you might talk to me

Cause I wish I was not myself
Anybody else then maybe you might notice me

The world will still go on without you
The newspapers still talk about you
And if your ever low, pick up the phone
I'll be 'round, don't tell a soul

Cause I'm not you, you're bullet proof
I'm in a crowd and I can't move
Cause I wish I was someone else
Anybody else so maybe you might talk to me
Cause I wish I was not myself
Anybody else then maybe you might notice me

Let me in, let me in
Gimme the sunshine all year 'round
Lemme out, lemme out
Gimme it now, hear me out, hear me shout

Gimme the munchies , show me around
Lemme out, lemme out, gimme the reason
Gimme it now
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Gotta big big house, big big mouth
Big, big, house, big, big mouth
Big, big, house, big, big mouth
That's not helping me right now

Cause I wish I was someone else
Anybody else so maybe you might talk to me
Cause I wish I was not myself
Anybody else then maybe you might notice me

Cause I wish I was someone else
Anybody else so maybe you might talk to me
Cause I wish I was not myself
Anybody else then maybe you might notice me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Intro: Timbaland]
Mr. JT, now what you got for me?
Mr. JT, now what you got for me?

Mr. JT, now what you got, what you got?
Mr. JT, now what you got for me?

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
You're sneaky
From the corner of my eye, I saw you eyeing me
I know that you're watching
Tell me
What would you do if I encouraged you to get next to me
When nobody's watching?

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
The way your body keeps moving
Is something that makes me weak
Let's start our own little secrets
For just you and me to keep
Too late to come off shy now
You've already gone this far
So baby, make your move, take charge
Show me what you got for me

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Oh no (Girl)
Is that your hands (your hands), rubbing on me?
Oh no (Girl)
Is that your hands (your hands), feeling on me?
Oh no (Girl)
Is that your hands (your hands), rubbing on me?
If so (Girl)
If that's your hands (your hands), then tell me what you got for me

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
Baby, I can tell that you want to do more
Than just dance with me
And I don't mind you flirting
But honestly
Do you really wanna spend the whole night passing looks at me?
(Looks at me)
Come over here and get to working

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
The way your body keeps moving
Is something that makes me weak (Makes me weak)
Let's start our own little secrets (Yeah)
For just you and me to keep (Us to keep)
Too late to come off shy now
You've already gone this far
So baby, make your move, take charge (Oooh)
Show me what you got for me

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Oh no (Girl)
Is that your hands (your hands), rubbing on me?
Oh no (Girl)
Is that your hands (your hands), feeling on me?
Oh no (Girl)
Is that your hands (your hands), rubbing on me?
If so (Girl)
If that's your hands (your hands), then tell me what you got for me

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake & (Timbaland)]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(What you got?)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(What you got?)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(What you got)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge 2: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
Oh no (Girl)
Is that your hands (your hands), rubbing on me?
Oh no (Girl)
Is that your hands (your hands), feeling on me?
Oh no (Girl)
Is that your hands (your hands), rubbing on me?
If so (Girl)
If that's your hands (your hands), then tell me what you got for me
Oh, oh, oh, oh... (What you got?)

[Outro: Justin Timberlake]
Oh no...
Your hands
Feeling on me
Oh no...
Your hands
Rubbing on me
Le, do, do, do, do...

[Verse 1]
Nabokov is sun-licked now
Upon the beach at Grunewald
Brilliant and naked just
The way that authors look
Clare and Lady Manners drink
Until the other cows go home
Gossip till their lips are bleeding
Politics and all

[Chorus]
I’d rather be high
I’d rather be flying
I’d rather be dead
Or out of my head
Than training these guns on those men in the sand
I’d rather be high

[Verse 2]
The Thames was black, the tower dark
I flew to Cairo, find my regiment
City’s full of generals
And generals full of shit
I stumble to the graveyard and I
Lay down by my parents, whisper
Just remember duckies
Everybody gets got

[Chorus]
I’d rather be high
I’d rather be flying
I’d rather be dead
Or out of my head
Than training these guns on those men in the sand
I’d rather be high

[Bridge]
I’m seventeen my looks can prove it
I’m so afraid that I will lose it
I’d rather smoke and phone my ex
Be pleading for some teenage sex
Yeah

[Chorus]
I’d rather be high
I’d rather be flying
I’d rather be dead
Or out of my head
Than training these guns on the men in the sand
I’d rather be high

[Verse 1]
Cutting through the water
Hands upon the ghost
To the city of solid iron
Through the kingdom of the boats
Send your friend away now
Let him sail back home tonight

[Chorus]
Something like religion
Dancing face to face
Something like a drowning
Dancing out in space
(Hey baby)
No-one here can see you
Dancing face to face
No-one here can beat you
Dancing out in space
(Hey baby)

[Verse 2]
Silent as Georges Rodenbach
Mist and silhouette
Girl, you move like water
You’ve got stars upon your head
You’ve got my name and number
You've got to take the floor

[Chorus]
Something like religion
Dancing face to face
Something like a drowning
Dancing out in space
(Hey baby)
No-one here can see you
Dancing face to face
No-one here can beat you
Dancing out in space
(Hey baby)
Dancing face to face
Dancing out in space
(Hey baby)
Dancing face to face
Dancing out in space
(Hey baby)
Dancing face to face
Dancing out in space

[Verse 1]
I don't need no dreams when I'm by your side, ooh-ooh
Every moment takes me to paradise
Darling, let me hold you
I'll warm you in my arms and melt your fears away
Show you all the magic that a perfect love can make
I need you night and day

[Chorus]
So baby, be mine (Baby, you got to be mine), ow
And girl I'll give you all I got to give
So baby, be my girl (All the time), ooh-ooh
And we can share this ecstasy
As long as we believe in love

[Break]
Ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
I won't give you reason to change your mind
(I can't sit still, you thrill me, baby, be mine)
You are all the future that I desire
Girl, I need to hold you
Share my feelings in the heat of love's embrace
Show you all the passion burning in my heart today
It's never gonna fade

[Chorus]
So baby, be mine (Baby you got to be mine), ow
And girl I'll give you all I got to give
So baby, be my girl (All the time), ooh-ooh
You're everything this world could be
The reason that I live, oh

[Bridge]
Won't you stay with me until the morning sun
I promise you now that the dawn will be different
Lady can't you see that heaven's just begun
It's living here inside our hearts

[Verse 3]
There'll be no more mountains for us to climb
(I can't be still, you thrill me, baby, be mine)
This will be a love lasting for all time
Girl, you got to hold me
We can touch the sky and light the darkest day
Hold me, only you and I can make sweet love this way
There's no more I can say-

[Chorus]
So baby, be mine (Baby be mine, baby you got to be mine)
Ow! (Tell me that you love me all the time)
And girl I'll give you all I got to give (Say you're thinking of me)
So baby, be mine (Girl be mine, all the time)
Ooh-ooh (Show me how it should be, hold me tight)
You're everything this world could be (Every night)
The reason that I live (It's alright, every night)

[Outro]
Baby, be my girl
(Baby be mine, tell me that you love me all the time)
And girl I'll give you all I got to give
(Say you're thinking of me, girl be mine)
So baby, be mine, baby, be mine
(Show me how it should be, hold me tight)
You're everything this world could be to me
(Every night, it's alright)
C'mon, girl (Baby be mine), c'mon girl (Tell me that you love me)
Ow! (All the time) hoo! (Say you're thinking of me)
So baby, be mine (Girl be mine, show me how it should be)
You're everything this world could be to me
(Every night, it's alright)
C'mon, girl (Baby be mine), c'mon girl (Tell me that you love me)
Baby be mine (All the time), hoo! (Say you're thinking of me)
So baby, be mine, girl

[Verse 1]
Girl, you're in the kitchen, cooking me a meal
Something makes me wanna come in there and get a feel
Walk around in your T-shirt, with nothing else on
Strutting past, switching that ass, while I'm on the phone, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
Cutting up tomatoes
Fruits and vegetables and potatoes
Girl, you look so sexy while you're doing the damn thing

[Chorus]
I want sex in the kitchen, over by the stove
Put you on the counter, by the buttered rolls
Hands on the table, on your tippy toes
Girl, we'll be making love, like the restaurant was closed

[Interlude]
How would you like it, babe? (Would you like that?)
Tell me right now, babe (Yeah, I'm going to call you back)

[Verse 2]
Girl, you're in the kitchen, chilling in your robe
I'm saying to myself, she better go put on some clothes
Tickling and teasing, doing that little dance
Girl, you gon' make me lay you down and give it to you more 'gin

[Pre-Chorus]
Cutting up tomatoes
Fruits and vegetables and potatoes
Girl, you look so sexy while you're doing the damn thing

[Chorus]
I want sex in the kitchen, over by the stove
Put you on the counter, by the buttered rolls
Hands on the table, on your tippy toes
Girl, we'll be making love, like the restaurant was closed
Sex in the kitchen, over by the stove
Put you on the counter, by the buttered rolls
Hands on the table, on your tippy toes
We'll be making love, like the restaurant was closed

[Interlude]
This is what I'm ready to do
Girl, I'm ready to toss your salad
While making love, I'll be feasting you

[Verse 3]
Girl, you're in the kitchen, sweating up a storm
The oven's on 500, so you know the kitchen's warm
Girl, you know just how to get into a brother's mind
'Cause here we are still in this kitchen doing it for the third time

[Pre-Chorus]
Cutting up tomatoes
Fruits and vegetables and potatoes
Girl, you look so sexy doing the damn thing that...

[Chorus]
I want sex in the kitchen, over by the stove
Put you on the counter, by the buttered rolls
Hands on the table, on your tippy toes
We'll be making love, like the restaurant was closed
Sex in the kitchen, over by the stove
Put you on the counter, by the buttered rolls
Hands on the table, on your tippy toes
We'll be making love, like the restaurant was closed, whoa
Sex in the kitchen, over by the stove
Put you on the counter, by the buttered rolls
Hands on the table, on your tippy toes
We'll be making love, like the restaurant was closed
Sex in the kitchen, over by the stove
Put you on the counter, by the buttered rolls
Hands on the table, on your tippy toes
We'll be making love, like the restaurant was closed
Sex in the kitchen, over by the stove
Put you on the counter, by the buttered rolls
Hands on the table, on your tippy toes
We'll be making love, like the restaurant was closed

[Intro]
So so so sweet, yeah
So so so sweet (CL, CL)
Come on!
Just come and ride with me (Head bang nigga, head bang nigga)
Yeah! Cudi nice nigga!
I'm different
Yeah

[Verse 1]
What the fuck ya'll niggas ponder when you think of K-I-D-C
Another motherfucker tryna flow up 'bout the ce-ze
That's right bitch, you need to pay respect
The checks on my Nikes these ain't the only checks I hope to get
Critics talk about there ain't no talent in the land
But tell it to your man who would spread it to where he can
Y'all niggas street dreamin', that's probably where it ends
I look down at you rappers and I'm only 5'10" nigga
Tired of niggas talkin' fly shit out of they mouth
Acting like they know me and the city I'm comin' out
I’m not a Bone Thug, don’t study to rhyme fast
I rhyme at a steady pace and I'ma make the same cash
Instead of talkin' bullshit, tit for tat
Hearin' these other niggas spittin' wack on these tracks
Instead of smirking and laughing when you think of Cleveland rap
Bow down, to Kid Mesc nigga, y'all know we did that
'Cause I'm

[Chorus]
They don't know yet
But I'm not the average nigga
They don't know yet
But I'm not the average nigga
They don't know yet
But I'm not the average
'Cause they don't know yet
But I'm not the average nigga

[Verse 2]
Don't stereotype Kid Mesc dawg, I'm not them
Don't be like "Damn my nigga, you sound like him!"
What you niggas know now wish y'all niggas knew then
I'm not that nigga
I'm the other Kid!
And you best be believin' my heat gon' simmer
I'm a special deliver while it hits you in your liver
I'll make your soul shiver, lay you still at your wake
Give these pussy ass niggas a solid reason to hate
I done leaped over the gate, but y'all scared to hop it
Speakin' about all these guns but y'all lames don't pop it
My album's so hot even your moms will go cop it
It'll take you millenniums for your mark ass to top it
Look look, now check here what your boy boy speaks
"Michael Johnson with the flow, work at your own speed", oh
You can't hate on a nigga that's great
Now y'all can't fuck with me I'm tryna get this cake 'cause

[Chorus]
They don't know yet
But I'm not the average nigga
They don't know yet
But I'm not the average nigga
They don't know yet
But I'm not the average
'Cause they don't know yet
But I'm not the average nigga

[Outro]
Nana, yeah
K-I, K-I, K-I, K-I-D
K-I (oh), K-I (sing it), K-I (oh), K-I-D
K-I (rock), K-I (oh), K-I (sing it), K-I-D
K-I (rock), K-I (one), K-I (two), K-I-D
Haha
Yeah, CL
Cudi
Rock with me, rock with me, come on
Bang pop nigga
It's the real, Midwest Action
Melwisky, I see you nigga
I'm not the average, I'm not the average
They don't know
CBD13
I'm not the average, I'm not the average

Heaven… it wouldn’t be the same without you
Wouldn’t be the same without you… my, oh my
I said heaven, it wouldn’t be the same without you
Wouldn’t be the same without you… my, oh my

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
When I think of all the friends I lost
Tears fall from my eyes
Tears fall from my eyes
From my eyes…
If I could only bring ‘em back
If I could only bring ‘em back
Bring ‘em back… and I would
It’s so much goin’ through in life
By and by… my, oh my
You don’t know what I’ve been goin’ through
Things ain’t the same, and I miss you
They say you in a better place
They say you in a better place

Heaven… it wouldn’t be the same without you
Wouldn’t be the same without you… my, oh my

‘Cause they in Heaven…

Hee-hee
Ooh
G'on, girl!
Aaow!
Hee

[Verse 1]
Hey, pretty baby with the high heels on
You give me fever like I've never, ever known
You're just a product of loveliness
I like the groove of your walk, your talk, your dress

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel your fever from miles around
I'll pick you up in my car and we'll paint the town
Just kiss me baby and tell me twice
That you're the one for me

[Chorus]
The way you make me feel
The way you make me feel
You really turn me on
You really turn me on
You knock me off of my feet
You knock me off of my feet
My lonely days are gone
My lonely days are gone
Uh, uh

[Verse 2]
I like the feelin' you're givin' me
Just hold me, baby, and I'm in ecstasy
Oh, I'll be workin' from nine to five
To buy you things to keep you by my side

[Pre-Chorus]
I've never felt so in love before
Just promise, baby, you'll love me forever more
I swear I'm keepin' you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me

[Chorus]
The way you make me feel
The way you make me feel
You really turn me on
You really turn me on
You knock me off of my feet now, baby
You knock me off of my feet
My lonely days are gone
My lonely days are gone

[Interlude 1]
Acha-ooh!
G'on, girl!
G'on!
Hee-hee
Aaow!
G'on, girl!
Wooh
Wooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I've never felt so in love before
Just promise, baby, you'll love me forever more
I swear I'm keepin' you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me

[Chorus]
The way you make me feel
The way you make me feel
You really turn me on
You really turn me on
You knock me off of my feet now, baby (Hee!)
You knock me off of my feet
My lonely days are gone (Ah, ah)
(My lonely days are gone)
The way you make me fee-hee!
The way you make me feel
You really turn me on
You really turn me on
You knock me off of my feet now, baby (Hee!)
You knock me off of my feet
My lonely days are gone
My lonely days are gone

[Bridge]
Ain't nobody's business
Ain't nobody's business
The way you make me feel
Ain't nobody's business
Ain't nobody's business
But mine and my baby
You really turn me on
Hee-hee!
You knock me off of my feet
Hee-hee! Ooh!
My lonely days are gone
Give it to me
Give me some time
The way you make me feel
Come on, be my girl
I wanna be with mine
You really turn me on
Ain't nobody's business
You knock me off of my feet
Ain't nobody's business
But mine and my baby
G'on, girl! Aaow!
My lonely days are gone

[Interlude 2]
Hee-hee!
Hoo!
Choo-coo, choo-coo
Choo-coo, choo-coo, choo-coo
G'on, girl!

[Outro]
The way you make me feel (Hee-hee!)
(Hee-hee-hee!)
You really turn me on
You knock me off of my feet
My lonely days are gone
Give it to me
Give me some time
The way you make me feel
Come on, be my girl
I wanna be with mine
You really turn me on
Ain't nobody's business
You knock me off of my feet
Ain't nobody's business
But mine and my baby
G'on, girl!
My lonely days are gone
Give it to me
Give me some time
The way you make me feel
Come on, be my girl
I wanna be with mine
You really turn me on
Ain't nobody's business
You knock me off of my feet

[Verse 1]
There's always somebody taller with more of a wit
And he's equipped to enthrall her and her friends think he’s fit
And you just can't measure up though, you don't have a prayer
Wishing that you'd made the most of her when she was there

[Pre-Chorus]
They've got engaged, there's no intention of a wedding
He's pinched your bird and he'd probably kick your head in

[Chorus]
Bigger boys and stolen sweethearts
Oh, you’re better off without her anyway
You said you wasn't sad to see her go
Yeah, but I know you were though

[Verse 2]
Now you don't know what she's up to, you can only assume
If she's not in the front of the shops then they've gone to his room
Bet she's gone 'round in her school stuff, bet that’s what he likes
I know you thought she were different and you thought she were nice

[Pre-Chorus]
But she's not nice, she's pretty fucking far from nice
She’s looking at you funny, rarely looking at you twice

[Chorus]
Bigger boys and stolen sweethearts
Oh, you’re better off without her anyway
You said you wasn't sad to see her go
Yeah, but it's clear you were though

[Verse 3]
Have you heard what she has been doing? Never did it for me
He picks her up at the school gate at twenty past three
She’s been with all of the boys but never went very far
And she wagged English and Science just to go in his car

[Pre-Chorus]
They've got engaged, there's no intention of a wedding
He's pinched me bird and he'd probably kick my head in
Oh, now the girls have grown
Yeah, but I'm sure that they still carry on in similar ways

[Chorus]
Bigger boys and stolen sweethearts
Oh, I'm better off without her anyway
I said I wasn’t sad to see her go
Yeah, but I’m only pretending, you know
Yeah, I’m only pretending, you know
I was only pretending, you know
I was only pretending, you know

[Hook x7: Mystikal]
Here I go!

[Verse: Mystikal]
It can get critical, I think it's pitiful
At them local bar trying to blow with Mystikal
We black and them roll, making you fold
Your soul has just been sold, your sun has start to erode
When it's coming, ice cold, silence is gold
Now you know, cause you've just been told
Moving, grooving, improving, as I walk they hold
Rhyme stink like the funk from the scent of a dead dog
The size of the highs, eating suckers alive
Too late to cry cause you won't survive
Had a two copper chopper and a punk
Say popper jocker stopper, got you hopping like a one-legged grasshopper
Hissing, missing, dissing... believe
Mo tricks up my sleeve than Merlin the magician
Rough rhyming, house wrecking like Black and Decker
Got tools for these fools, making moves like I'm playing checkers
Bragging and ragging, gagging, sacking and ragging
Rhymes tagging like the seven deadly fists of the land dragon
Banking and jipping, can call the drank in a sipping
They got me running my lip and got 'em thinking I'm tripping
I probably school them and skeeze, then barbecue them and tease them
Slice them, dice them with beans and rise, buy it seasonal
Words of the prides, paralyse and advise
Scalpel like rhyme, get the mic circumcised
I like to outward my punch
How'd you like the pretty ones?
I gotta hunt you on a munch (yeah man)
I can't be beat on a beat, have them kissing my feet
Stop beating your bitch and wipe that hair off your teeth
I ain't popping no joke punk, more funk than a skunk
When I flow that you sunk, cause your album is broke
Come here, let me see the difference between a man and a...
I'm back from the river, you little motherf... hmm

[Hook x8]

[Verse 2: Mystikal]
Justice and brutalizing that suckers is dissing
I kick them and stick them, then I rip them, they can't mess with me
Hope your seatbelt is fastened, known for massive harassing
Confesses masses slam crashing, I'm your daily assassin
Hop hop, hardcore, listen close to the emperor
Burn, woof, burn, like a flamethrower
Rocking awesome, I'm 'bout to boss hard an long
Strong as a python, my ... bite, 209 degrees Fahrenheit
These fools about to get humbled, I stumble and fumble, MCs I crumble
Coming like a comando, I'm so deadly, you don't want to rumble
That's right, don't panic, I'm causing havoc
Searching like a torpedo, gigantic as the Titanic
Rhymes humble the drums, got them stunned and running
All those of them... they know when I'm coming!
Hard hitter, bullshitter, head splitter when bitter
Assassinate a rookie killer like Adolf Hitler
Huh, and if it's true what they said, them I'mma get ya
I'mma drag 'em to the river bad boy, you're 'bout to get a problem, back off

[Hook x8]

[Verse 3: Mystikal]
Y'all come at dingo, warriors, suckers I crush
I'm to cruel to be moved, I'm to much to be touched
Got them dangling and jangling, to that... when they hit this
Fight me like a viking, tragic like a terrorist
Thank you a lot, but I'm yet to beget
I know I rhyme to beat my enemy cause I'm the deadly friend
I'm once at the gate, I want to get in
Let's just say for all these stuff you're putting me through
This revenge, now put your head down and be silent
To you get worldwide round this shit, be quiet
I'm sick and tired of wasting time on you suckers
You're better not ready, be wasting some rhymes on you suckers
The BG splitter, 3D killer, back from the river
I'm 'bout to lay you young big mouth punks down
Without your pillow, you won't save Mystikal no' mo'
Somebody said that you were looking for me...

[Hook x8]

[Bridge 2: apl.de.ap & (will.i.am)]
Que pasa señorita, you a bronze skin mama
Me a mama son I wanna take you to Havana
We could get down every day of the semana
Dance to the music and follow the guitarra
(Clap, clap, clap, come on)
Dame un momento quelo vuelvo como peso
Take you to Philippines then you don't have to spend a peso
We got connection like a novel to Aurida
I can relate cause latin girls look Phillipina
Check your history there's no mystery between us
Destiny made it possible to be us
I know about your culture cause it's mixed with mine
We go together well just like beats and rhymes and
Tequilas and limes and celeste with pine and
I'll say one more time, I like them'

Contigo yo quiero...

[Verse 1: Sapient]
I've been obsessed with words ever since I was a little buck
Then I grew bigger and figured drawing pads weren't big enough
I wanted to use a wall, but in school was taught not to
And that graffiti was the root of all evil
It's just letters and making them unnatural shapes
So clean caps, surgical masks is actually sayin' activate
To coat our empire
Liftin' mad cans of paint from Fred Meyer's
Empty 'em out under bridges and walls of alleyways
Giving the graff task force a sour taste
The same flavor that makes haters salivate
I was more gully as a minor, caught a felony, so nowadays
I don't struggle to prove nothing to you
I get a head full of letters, I'm cutting 'em loose
Up in the booth, cousin, it ain't a gift, it's a habit
Whether good or bad, I won't regret it when I'm looking back

[Hook: Sapient]
‘Cause I'm a letterhead
I'm a letterhead
So don't sweat the technique
When I represent me; get 'em!

[Verse 2: Illmaculate]
Lunch time, I was tryin' to bring that realness back
Fuck the lunch line, 'cause I ain't have no skrill or scratch
I was on the way to Fred Meyer's just to fill my bags
Steppin' in the home improvement section with my sticky hands
That's why I got these baggy pants: to conceal the stash
But undercover security can't conceal his badge
I know every single camera that this building has
And I racked so many cans that I'm almost feelin' bad
That's exactly what a bad look ain't
‘Cause it's quite good, like the Backwood taste
And I never stole a Snickers, but I have took paint
So, hello, my name is pickers in the blackbook, thanks!
Shit, I'd be admired if I was tryin' harder
But I'm a riot starter, beef igniter
Just a street writer, but I hope to die a martyr
Freedom fighter, with a stolen Pilot marker

[Hook: Illmaculate]
Why you got all that spray paint on your finger tips?
‘Cause I'm a letterhead
I'm a letterhead
So don't sweat the technique
While I represent me

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
I was just a kid in Seattle, doin' kickflips in a flannel
With some fat caps, I racked off midget enamels
In Cali, they rhyme "Shelltoes" with "Melrose"
My posse was on Broadway, scribin' on the metros
Gettin' pound by the bus driver — "Hell nah!"
I was a letterhead, my life was graffiti
Letters I lived, I put pride in that mean street
Adventures to your ribs, I'm not goin' to the precinct
You can buff me, you can cuff me, you can't stop me
I'm young, cocky, gettin' up with my sharpie
Michelangelo with the concrete
That little ball in the paint can
Was the metronome to my heartbeat
I put my freedom on the line for the letters on the walls
Shubu, patriot, flat black up in my palm
Cherry red in my blood, I bleed the ink through my arms
It's like America: bombin' buildings and not gettin' caught

[Hook: Macklemore]
Nope, I'm not gettin' caught
‘Cause I'm a letterhead
Yes, I am, I've been tellin' you that
Don't sweat the technique
While I'm killin' these beats

[Verse 1]
Midnight in the Village
Seeger lights the candles
From Bitter End to Gaslight
Baez leaves the stage
Ochs takes notes
When the black girl and guitar
Burn together hot in rage
You've got what it takes
You say too much

[Chorus]
Oh you will set the world babe
You will set the world on fire
I can work the scene and
I can see the magazines
I can hear the nation
I can hear the nation cry
You will set the world babe
You will set the world on fire
You will set it on fire

[Verse 2]
Kennedy would kill for the lines that you’ve written
Van Ronk says to Bobby "she’s the next real thing"
Crouched in the half light, screaming like a banshee
You’re in the boat babe, we're in the water
You say too much

[Chorus]
Oh you will set the world babe
You will set the world on fire
I can work the scene and
I can see the magazines
I can hear the nation
I can hear the nation cry
You will set the world babe
You will set the world on fire
You will set it on fire

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Oh you will set the world babe
You will set the world on fire
I can work the scene and
I can see the magazines
I can hear the nation
I can hear the nation cry
You will set the world babe
You will set the world on fire
You will set it on fire
Oh you will set the world babe
You will set the world on fire
I can work the scene and
I can see the magazines
I can hear the nation
I can hear the nation cry
You will set the world babe
You will set the world on fire
You will set it on fire

[Verse 1]
Then we saw Mishima's dog
Trapped between the rocks
Blocking the waterfall
The songs of dust
The world would end
The night was always falling
The peacock in the snow

[Chorus]
And I tell myself, I don't know who I am
And I tell myself, I don't know who I am
My father ran the prison
My father ran the prison

[Verse 2]
I can only love you by hating him more
That's not the truth, it's too big a word
He believed that love is theft
Love and war, the theft of love

[Chorus]
And I tell myself, I don't know who I am
And I tell myself, I don't know who I am
My father ran the prison
My father ran the prison

[Bridge]
But I am a seer, I am a liar
I am a seer, but I am a liar

[Chorus]
My father ran the prison
My father ran the prison

[Verse 1]
For the priceless man
Who suffers gloom
So slow
Eyes were stolen
For her
A sleeping sky
Takes the moon
So slow
I would slide away
Further out to sea
Further out to sea
So she

[Verse 2]
She saw me smile
Feeling like
I’d never been
She saw me smile
Feeling like I’d never been
In love
Feeling like I’d never been
The only one and all alone
The only one and all alone
Intro:

[Notorious B.I.G]
The Fuck Happened to the home of the brave
Niggas running off headed to the grave
Black president, don't matter
Shit just getting worst life is shattered
A land of freedom is flipping out
All I want is a life without a doubt

Verse 1

[Ice Cube]
Thug life, we all been through it
Life's a struggle though it's not split
Illuminati or whatever the fuck they go by
They the reason why the world so dry
I'm just a nigga tryna live my life
Everyday staying away from the tip of a knife
Or the the fire from a fucking 9 millimeter
This damn Gangasta life is that of a cheater
I'm starting to think we living in a trash can
Jus' waiting to be swallowed up bu the Klu Klux klan
Verse 2

[Notorious B.I.G]
Every night sleeping with a common dream
That everyone be on the same team
When I die, fuck it I wanna go to hell
Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven with the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Tims and black hoodies
God'll prolly have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin' my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wished she got a fucking abortion

Verse 3

[Ice Cube]
Dope on the corner, look at the coroner
Daughter is dead, mother is mourning her
Strayed bullets, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waiting patiently but they couldn't
Bring her back, who got the footage?
Channel 9, cameras is looking
It's hard to channel your energy when you know you're crooked
Banana clip, split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dying of thirst, dying of thirst, dying of thirst
Bitch how could this get any worse than it is worst
America might as well be cursed

[Verse 1]
There's a graveyard by the station where the girls
Wear vinyl skirts and sandals from Hungary
The boys ride their Riga 1s upon the little hills
Such sadness and grief, the kids die standing
That's where we made our tryst and struggled with our guns
Would you still love me if the clocks could go backwards?
The girls would fill with blood, and the grass will be green again
Remember the dead, they were so great, some of them

[Chorus]
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
How does the grass grow? Blood, blood, blood
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Where do the boys lie? Mud, mud, mud
How does the grass grow? Blood, blood, blood

[Verse 2]
Well I lived a blind life, a white face, a prison
That you made, a life out of nothing, now I ride by
Black roads. I miss you more than you'll never, ever know
Waiting with my red eyes and my stone heart

[Chorus]
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
How does the grass grow? Blood, blood, blood
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Where do the boys lie? Mud, mud, mud
How does the grass grow? Blood, blood, blood

[Bridge]
I gaze in defeat at the stars in the night
The light in my life burnt away
There will be no tomorrow
Then you'll sigh in your sleep
And meaning returns with the day

[Chorus]
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
Where do the boys lie? Mud, mud, mud
How does the grass grow? Blood, blood, blood

[Intro: Tyler, the Creator]
Nah, no, nah, nah, fuck that. Niggas think 'cause you fucking made 'Chum' and got all personal that niggas won't go back to that old fucking 2010 shit about talking 'bout fucking everything-all. No, fuck that, nigga, I got you. Fuck that

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
Grab mittens, who have to spit blizzardous
Actually, flick cigarette ash at bitch niggas
Harassment, eight nickels of hash, delay quick, and then
Dash to Saint Nicholas pad to taste venison
Still in the business of smacking up little rappers with
Racquets you play tennis with, hated for bank lifting and
Spraying then hide away in the shade of his maimed innocence
Suitcase scented with haze and filetted sentences
Advanced apathy, smashing the man cameras up
Tan khakis, an antagonist Dan-dappered up
Ha, vagabond, had it since a Padawan
Rapping hot as fucking cattle brands wearing flannel thongs
Grab a bong, mama and some food, beer, tag along
Get a nice spanking, uh, new Sears catalog
Send them nettled critics to the bezel stop, dead and wrong
Get 'em higher than the pitch of metal tea-kettle songs
(Bitch-ass niggas!)

[Hook: Tyler, the Creator]
Four deep in a Rover cannon
Riding dirty through a Saugus canyon, niggas know that it's the
G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G, G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G
50k for the last check
But the Dollar Menu still be on deck, nigga it's the mothafuckin'
G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G, G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
Yeah, the misadventures of a shit-talker
Pissed as Rick Ross's fifth sip off his sixth lager
Known to sit and wash the sins off at the pitch alter
Hat never backwards like the print off legit manga
Get it? Like a blue pill, make ya stick longer
Or a swift fist off your chin from his wrist-launcher
Chick, chronic thrift shopper, thick like the Knicks roster
Stormed off and came straight back like pigs' posture
Pen? Naw, probably written with some used syringes
From out the rubbish bin at your local loony clinic
Watching movies in a room full of goons he rented
On the hunt for clues, more food, and some floozy women
Bruising gimmicks with the broom he usually use for Quidditch
Gooey writtens, scoot 'em to a ditch, chewed and booty-scented
Too pretentious, do pretend like he could lose with spitting
Steaming tubes of poop and twisted doobies full of euphemisms
Stupid, thought it up, jot it quick 
Thaw it out, toss it right back like a vodka fifth
Spot him on a rocket swapping dollars in for pocket lint
Then lob a wad of chicken at a copper on some Flocka shit

[Hook: Tyler, the Creator]
Posing nigga try to disrespect
Get a fucking thunder to his neck, shout out to Nak
'Cause it's the G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G, G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G
Looking bummy, posted on the block, like I ain't make
A quarter million off of socks, nigga
'Cause it's the G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G, G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G

[Outro: Tyler, the Creator]
Bitch niggas
Wolf Gang (Motherfucker)
Golf Wang, nigga (Lil bitch-ass niggas)
Trashwang, Loiter Squad

You not welcome (Motherfucker)
Circa ’08, bitch! Yeah
(O.F., nigga)

[Verse]
Holla at ya boy its Weezy Baby
They label me a problem and I probably am so I dont knock em
I pop up in a broccoli Lam' on choppers
With an ol' school bitch, she got on door knockers
And she knock on your door for that raw partner
Hollygrove Wayne, that boy a monster
Jacked for a Mazda come back in Mase-rati
Like how he? Why he? Cause I be
Moving through the city like an I.V
Tryna be monogamous but I got bitches on my dick
Like I'm the shit cause I'm the shit
So I only promise this: to my little girl I will give you the world
And to my unborn I'm tryna reason with ya moms so
If I'm not with her when you get here, its already clear
Yeah, and for their sake I'm a ball every year
I'm a pause every tear
And tattoo it on my face
Niggas know, that I got that black music on my waist
Make me put it to your ear and get that b-b-b-b-bass
Bluka bluka to ya face, closed casket
Mama can't remember shit but last saturday, what a tragedy
Flowers for the family
Powder in my nap sack
Running through the projects, tryna get a stack back
I got my SK bout to get my MAC back to pap pap at niggas who yap yap
Yup yup! and I rep that 17 hard, you know
'til a nigga ain't nothing but tomb quotes
Raw Tune, who you know go harder than dude
See these is the clues, part of my shoes
I bleed with them dudes I'm part of the crew
Don't move cause you right in the route of the gun mouth
When it talk, you know what come out- barreltone
Nigga y-y-young Wayne from out Carrollton
Yeah, I got my eyes on the sparrow
Though my path is narrow, my angels are shadows
I saddled up, and get the fucking battle
Automatics up, like nigga fuck whoever
You touch and reach, you get fucking bleached
Above the law niggas put you underneath
You call the law nigga? You fucking leech!
You Saved by the Bell, you fucking Screech
My bucket screech through the streets like a R&B singer
You ain't pimping until you fuck a R&B singer
I walked in this building with all these bangers
And all these niggas look like targets to me
What's a drought to you may be a bargain to me
Cause I just may be sitting on a carton of Ki's
I got important people thats trying to market me
So I'm gon' stop talking 'bout the white, Sike!
I know I'm not walking without a fight
So I'm swinging with all my might
We can go all night
I'm a blow all day, and I'm a blow all night
Do a verse today and do a show tonight!
Fuck a ho today, and fuck a ho tonight!
Im' a live my life like there's no tonight
I might go tonight so mama pray don't cry
Cause your prayers maybe working, mama they gon' try
Yeah,and we rock to the same lullaby
Nigga I got 10, nigga I got 5
I hope you got yours, cause nigga I got mine
I'm goin for the green bitch, Its popeye time
So I can be a paid nigga, and make that tomb stone say "I'm a made nigga"
I'm a MADE nigga

[Verse 1:  A$AP Rocky]
Used to call me Push ‘cause I pushed by the quarter
Used to push keys ‘til the D's pushed harder
Push “start” – push buttons, start the car up
Push me, push your wig back like barbers
Off with your toupee, I boss hog like two lanes
Fuck red dots but my bullets come in Blu-ray
Pussy-ass niggas and they sweet like Kool-Aid
Married to the game, tell them niggas catch the bouquet
Don’t fuck with hoes, sometimes I’d rather beat off
My kicks so fire, burn the skin up on my feet off
Tell ‘em turn the heat down, they tell me my mink off
She’s so abusive, the boy she wanna skeet off

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
Fancy, fancy, met her on Delancey
Pum-pum so good I eat her through her panties
Every Jamaican bitch always trippin’ off of Xanny
Wine Slow, so I give her gold like Santi
Bapes on my feet make the cypher complete
Margielas by the week, say my style is unique
Picking bitches by their teeth, for my bitches be heat
Put the pussy on lock, I remind 'em of sheiks
Cuttin’ niggas with my lines like a barber with Zekes
Burnin’ niggas with my rhymes, let the arsonist speak
I’m tryna have a Nicki Minaj every week
And fuck makin’ her cum, Imma fuck her ‘til she pee
And if she was a midget, I would fuck her on my knees
‘Cause that ass fat, I will fuck her ‘til she sleep
It’s Trap Lord Sunday every day of the week
A-S-A-P ‘til I D-I-E, ma’fucka

[Vere 1: Lil Wayne]
Like I dropped straight from heaven
Five strong words: rest in peace Lil Kevin
And this ain't how I was born
But this is how I live
So that's how I'll die, and do not close my eyes
So when you see me in the casket I'm a look right back at ya
Cause I don't trust none of y'all
Fuck every one of y'all
Now which one of y'all wanna brawl?
And overall I got that pistol under all of my garments
Torment, torture
Tragedy, catastrophe
No battery, just murder in the coldest temperature
And that means first degree
Even deaf motherfuckers done heard of me
I ain't gonna let you motherfuckers worry me
And tell that beef I'm Burger King
I represent that saint's sign
I'm so high I can paint signs
And if she ain't fine, she ain't mine
Thank god that I'm alive
But if he end it all today, I have done more that I can say
(Amen)

[Hook: Lil Wayne & Juelz Santana]
Let's pray (let's pray)
Ten fingers (ten fingers)
Together for forever (forever)
Let's pray (let's pray)
Together (together)
Forever, forever

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
The Lord is my shepherd
You haters can't harm me
I walk with his blessings
The angels be my army
Of course there's a weapon on my waist within arm's reach
That's my baby keep it strapped in like a car seat (yes)
Though I walk through the valley in the shadows of death
Forgive me Lord I had to carry my tech
I touch cash and get cheese
Play with that cash I bust mags, indeed
Forgive those who trespassed against me
For they know not what they do until they history
Gone, memories
Lord grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change
Like what happens when I get up with my enemies
Paybacks, penalties
Bang back, send em' these
Funerals, these people got to waste more Hennessey (yeah)
They got to pour it on the floor for ya
Maybe next time they'll pray a little more for ya

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kidd Kidd]
I pray to God not Lucifer
Devil I'm rebuking ya
Lord have mercy on my soul when I'm suited up
Daddy was a hustla, mommy was a Christian
Momma said prayers, daddy steady cookin' chicken
If I'm living life wrong, I don't wanna be right
Send me blessings to the cloud, hope I make it through the night
Dear Lord as you lay me down to sleep
I pray to the Lord my soul to keep
If I shall die before I wake
Then I pray to the Lord my soul to take
There shall be no other god before thee
Lord please forgive me of my sins if I O.D, slowly
I know I should not kill but I will
If a nigga try to shoot me and lay me still
I'm so sorry for the wrong thing's that I've done
This the end of my prayer we all say amen

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Dear God
As I begin this day, my thoughts turn to you
And I ask for your help and guidance in everything I say and do
Give me the patience that I need to keep my peace of mind
And with life's cares, I hope dear God, some happiness to find
Let me live but for today, not worrying what's ahead, for I have trust that you
Will see I get my daily bread
Give me the courage to face life's trials and not from troubles run
And let me keep this thought in mind "Thy will, not mine, be done."
And if some wish I do not get though I have prayed to thee
Please help me to believe and understand you know what's best for me
I've failed you many time, I know
But tonight when I rest
I hope that I can say, "Dear God, I've tried my best....rapper alive."

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
F'n'F up all day (all day)
Young pro is on the cut always (always)
If you represent your set when you're rolling through the jets
Take your fingers off your triggers keep your hands of your Tecs. Check it

I'm really gnarly
Really harder than tryna wheely Harleys
I will leave hardly, life of the party
Hotter than Saudis in furs in the Mojave
Don't make me catch a body

[Silenced gun shots, body hitting the floor]

F'n'F up all day (all day)
Young pro is on the cut always (always)
If you represent your set when you're rolling through the jets
Take your fingers off your triggers keep your hands of your techs. Check it

I'm really gnarly
Really harder than tryna wheely Harleys
I will leave hardly, life of the party
Hotter than Saudis in furs in the Mojave
Don't make me catch a body
First and Fifteenth probably
Playa don't trip when the clique's in the party
You trip, then it kick, like Mr. Miyagi
I brought an extra clip in event of a robbery
You flinch then it click like Clint, Dirty Harry
Don't think that my money gettin' spent on Ferraris
This game that was told is old as Ataris
You sold into slavery
The system I pimps, I limps like a Charley
Horse. Bring the chorus!

[Hook]
Ain't it boss, playa?
Homie, don't it be like that
When it be like that
When it's G like that?
Ain't it boss, playa?
Homie you can't leave like that
When you bleed like that
You won't be right back
Ain't it boss, playa?
What, you think we freeze right up
When you breeze right up?
Don't you bleed like us?
Ain't it boss, playa?
Paper makin' on top
Playa hatin' won't stop
Percolatin' on lock
Ain't it boss, playa?

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
If it's getting too hot
Better go'on out the galley
I'm a top cat, homes
Got a phone in the alley
And I locks that down
When I zone, understand me
And I drop rap poems
Like domes on the Caddy
When the top back
Go'on better stop that
Like cops when you clock that
Brougham goin' over the speed limit
You spot that
Somethin's been thrown like bones
And you combin' for baggies
And you see it's weed in his seat
Me an' my man G
Had a home in the valley
And I just left New York
And I'm goin' back to Cali
Where I chop that, yup
Gotta bone me a sal'ry
And I'm back in the cut
Still hungry as Shaggy
Like I need that
So free that the fee that
See that keep it copasetic
Don't do nothin' sudden
Push the button
Hustlin' to keep my leverage, uh!
You can't destroy me
Know who them boys be?
I ain't no employee!
I'm the boss, playa!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gemstones]
I'm pimpin' with playas that be pimpin'
I'm pimpin' this broad
But how could one man be so pimpin'?
Shit-if pimpin' is hard
Cuz goofies
Kill for that nookie even clap at they dogs
Givin' they
Heart to these chickens, I'm unstrappin' they bras
Lendin' they
Cars to these chickens even platinum cards
All in the
Mall with these chickens puttin' carats on arms
I have 'em
Posin' in pictures with my shaft in they jaws
Laughin' cuz dro in my system
Plus I'm havin' a ball
Coulda been somewhere with open liquor
Drivin' the Porsche
Ain't too many rich as flows as this in Robber Report
Properties bought
Believe I seen that watch in the sauce
Hot but his force
Monopoly's my hobby and yours'
Probably sports!
It's obvious you saw me. Get lost!
Give me some privacy
See how many rocks in that cross
You think of robbin' me
But you don't want no problems young boy
You wanna ride with me
Make a choice the option is yours
Ain't it boss, playa?

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Bishop G]
Man the game ain't the same since the 'caine done stopped
DEA's done slowed up the game 'round near Brainerd Park
'Bout the same time Greg
Got shot in the head
Nigga Pack got his momma's house
Took by the feds
But of course what you expect
When you pitchin' where you rest
Holdin' rocks beneath your tongue
Wearin' slippers on your steps
But for what? A couple pennies
Not enough to by a semi
So the corners of the dean was racin' niggas yellin 'Gimmie'
That reminds me little Kenny got shot three months ago (damn.)
Fresh out the hospital; shot three weeks ago (damn!)
Come to find out only difference from the first
Was the niggas that just got him ain't no different from the first
And I wonder whatta happened to his crazy brother Spider
Used to be my 'lil roadie back in 1995 so
Last I heard he's doin' robbin'
Shot some nigga in the Gardens
He sat in the body cast behind the glass next to the sergeant

[Hook]

[Intro: Sample]
Person 1: It's too epic
Person 2: The New York 

[?] was mind boggling
Person 3: Fast moving
Person 4: I've never seen screens that big
Person 5: It's fantastic
Person 6: It's overwhelming, all that sound and all those screens
Person 7: The Incredible New York Experience, 

[?]

[Verse 1]
I would rather grow up knowing
I wouldn't have to move so fast
I wouldn't miss the trains and the longer waits
They'd only make me feel bad
I don't think that it's right
I gotta ride for an hour or two just to see my baby
Cause I know that she calls
And I know what she wants
And she wants me closer
Oh oh oh

[Chorus]
Why do I have to live there?
To better my life
It's not fair
It's not fair
It's not fair
It's not fair
It's not fair
It's not fair

[Verse 2]
Coming out on the bedford stop
I fit right in now I'm nobody
I'm sure the night life is great
And so are jobs and the girls but I know I can find that here

[Chorus]
I don't have to live there
To better my life it's not fair
I don't have to live there
To better my life it's not fair
It's not fair
It's not fair

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Bear witness
Watch me get it in like underage club attendants
The roof go back like it's vintage
The young boy's back to burn your village, the fire touching the ceiling burn
What's God willing when HOVA retired?
Now he back, guess he got some competition on his hands
Who is that? I...am...
K-Dot, I'm claustrophobic don't put me in the box with you niggas
You can't categorize me
I'm already convinced that I'm the hottest nigga out
Any comments? I thought so
You niggas is gassed up like ALCO
Scared to play Madden on All-Pro
Step your game up
I'm here to fuck up niggas' barcodes
SoundScan'll never read your albums again (whoo!)
I take 99.9% of your fans
The last one left is your moms (and she even iffy about you...)
Ain't nothing gifted about you
Put a bullet in you, tell a doctor get it up out you
I'm 'bout to, send him right there, he shark food
Piranhas is coming I put beat on you rap dudes
I don't wait on you rap dudes
Nigga NASA couldn't reach my altitude
Sky's the limit, and your body ain't airborne...
Is it? Are you?

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
My real niggas, once again it's on
'Til we load the ammo and drop the bomb
I kick up destruction and when I'm done
My city blow them horns, it sounds like...
(Whoo-ee!)
When they blow dem horns I'm coming
Torch in hand, yes, I'm running

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I told Jay Rock, I like red too
But you gotta kill these niggas out the blue
They don't see it coming
Who ain't a part of the family tree
Do 'em like Paul Bunyan, axe about him
We travel like an ant colony, you can't count us
Sip Henny 'til my throat drown
New Benz, No Malice
Count money 'til our hands get calloused
40 caliber in the Cavalier, welcome to Los
Angeles, you might leave with bandages
Real life, no mannequin
You pull out, no panicking, you better shoot
Or have something fall on your rooftop, no raindrops
I'm talking 'bout gold bullets and black suits
No magician, no magic, POOF
Closed casket fatal attraction
Son, three hit you like John Paxson, I ain't bull-shitting
Them veterans been loved 'em
Talk about bars I got a life sentence of 'em
And I'm just like spitting cousin, ciao
No man get the best of him

[Verse 3: Punch]
The way I see, why rap?
I'm just wasting my breath
Y'all don't hear me
I'm just chasing my death
It's all over, the end's here so I'm pacing my steps
Try not to recollect what I know
These pregnant quotes meaning, they give life like semen
Be the reason my heart's bleeding
I'm coughing up blood in my palms as I recite the book of Psalms
Over a slow clap and kick drum, wis-dom
The application of your knowledge is me
Pay your tuition, this verse is like a college degree
Y'all don't hear me, y'all fear me like a doomsday prophet
When I'm focused, nothing under the moon can stop it
I leave you off the Earth's surface, that's what you get
For trying to test my patience like nurses
This ain't a verse this is a Kennedy curse
Put your brain on your lady's purses, you niggas crazy

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
My real niggas, once again it's on
'Til we load the ammo and drop the bomb
I kick up destruction and when I'm done
My city blow them horns, it sounds like...
(Whoo-ee!)
When they blow dem horns I'm coming
Torch in hand, yes, I'm running
My real niggas, once again it's on
'Til we load the ammo and drop the bomb
I kick up destruction and when I'm done
My city blow them horns, it sounds like...
(Whoo-ee!)
When they blow dem horns I'm coming
Torch in hand, yes, I'm running

[Intro: Action Bronson]
Get it together Justin, got to get it together fam
Let's go

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
Yeah, fuck the back talk
Save all that pussy shit for the cat walk
Now write your name 100 times on the blackboard
Just a white man excelling in a Black sport, like I'm Pistol Pete
You already know you a goner when I kiss your cheek
Lift your feet, like when your sister sweeps
Fine dining, drink water out the crystal creek
Straight from Queens rocking leathers like I'm Mr. Cheeks

[Interlude: Action Bronson]
Uhhhh, fly shit
Grown man shit
Do it one more time, fuck it
I'm good to go
Alright

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
Yo, I'm a wild freak, hit shorty where the child sleep
While her mother make soup with the cow feet
Shoulder pads and a leather, Beau Brummell
Hopping out the limo at the old Tunnel
Fuck sex on the beach, I want head in the streets
Spread bed on the feet
Lead on your cheek, the cadillac from 73
Aqua marine with a popular fiend, uhh
Big Bird, Farrington alumnus
Mouth like a pussy, she gum dick

[Verse 3: Action Bronson]
You see me in the green velour, facial conquistador
Then I order up a feast for four
If you see me in a leather, know it's reaching the floor
Linen flapping in the wind cause of the breezy shore, yeah
Spinal tap, you spitting gynecology rap
Eat your pussy with a plastic bag, covering that
Brothers will clap leave you hovered or jacked
If there's chicken in the building, know I'm smothering that
This tool I got will loosen up your stool a lot
Near the pee pee will make you poo-poo a lot
In the Z3 bumping U2

[Interlude: Big Body Bes]
Yo, this Big motherfucking Body, bitch

[Verse 4: Action Bronson]
Ginger ale laying in a Knicks cup
Pay thirty dollars for a dick suck
Pay a hundred dollars for the joints I rolled
Oyster bowls chilling in the cloisters
I love Black girls boisterous
Shorty's on the arm like a koi fish
On a herby white dude with the yellow fever
Yellow sneakers, see through yellow beeper

[Sample: Charlie Sheen]
Banging seven gram rocks and finishing them
Because that’s how I roll, I have one speed, I have one gear

[Interlude: Action Bronson]
Yeah, uh-huh
Feel the beat…

[Hook]
When our eyes first met, was like the fourth day in July
When you kissed my lips, I knew one day you'd be mine

[Verse 5: Action Bronson]
Watch my shorty take a shower, I want the good loving
Six ducks in a wood burning oven
Georgia Southern, her alma mater
She raised out in Queens, but moved out to Colorado
Looney Tunes, Taz on the shirt
Fuck swag, got pizzazz
Two jags, Cincinnati Zubaz
Du rag, Bay Terrace pool pass
Talked to Skip, schooled me on the ponies
Next year catch me posing at the Tonys
Folding paper wilding at the OTB
Grow the money like a Cocha tree

[Verse 6: Action Bronson]
American flags hang on walls that hide money
Put my arm through the Picasso
Kept a fortress, crib got the Tex-Mex motif, wolves howling
Two stallions pull the buggy, Clydesdale
Crack the Bud, guzzle, humidors
Uncle Moozy with the Mitsubishi
Uncle Jimmy with the funny money flossing out in AC
Randy Quaid with the turtleneck
Erma with the jungle juice, man feet
Beamer, tan seats
Smack the taco out your mouth, green couch

[Intro: Wyclef Jean]
Ladies up in here tonight
No fighting (We got the refugees up in here)
No fighting
No fighting
Shakira, Shakira

[Pre-Chorus: Wyclef Jean & Shakira]
I never really knew that she could dance like this (Hey)
She make a man wanna speak Spanish
¿Cómo se llama (Sí!), bonita? (Sí!)
Mi casa, su casa (Shakira, Shakira)
Oh baby, when you talk like that (Huh-uh) (Yeah)
You make a woman go mad (Oh)
So be wise (Sí!) and keep on (Sí!)
Reading the signs of my body (Uno, dos, tres, cuatro)
No fighting

[Chorus: Shakira  & Wyclef Jean]
I'm on tonight
You know my hips don't lie (No fighting)
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see, baby? This is perfection

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
Hey girl, I can see your body moving
And it's driving me crazy (Huh-uh)
And I didn't have the slightest idea
Until I saw you dancing (Yeah)
That when you walk up on the dance floor, nobody cannot ignore
The way you move your body, girl (Just smooth)
And everything's so unexpected, the way you right and left it
So you can keep on shaking it (Let's go)

[Pre-Chorus: Wyclef Jean & Shakira]
I never really knew that she could dance like this (Hey)
She make a man wanna speak Spanish
¿Cómo se llama (Sí!), bonita? (Sí!)
Mi casa, su casa (Shakira, Shakira)

So be wise (Sí!) and keep on (Sí!)
Reading the signs of my body
No fighting

[Chorus: Shakira  & Wyclef Jean]
I'm on tonight
You know my hips don't lie (No fighting)
And I'm starting to feel you, boy (Yeah)
Come on, let's go, real slow
Don't you see, baby? Así es perfecto
They know I'm on tonight (Yeah)
My hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see baby? This is perfection (Shakira, Shakira)

[Verse 2: Shakira & Wyclef Jean]
Oh boy, I can see your body moving
Half animal, half man
I don't, don't really know what I'm doing
But you seem to have a plan (Yeah)
My will and self-restraint
Have come to fail now, fail now
See, I'm doing what I can, but I can't, so, you know
That's a bit too hard to explain (Uno, dos, tres, cuatro)

[Bridge 1: Wyclef Jean with Shakira]
Baila en la calle de noche (Uh, yeah)
Baila en la calle de día (Let's go!)
Baila en la calle de noche (Uh, yeah)
Baila en la calle de día (Let's go!)

[Pre-Bridge: Wyclef Jean & Shakira]
I never really knew that she could dance like this (Hey)
She make a man wanna speak Spanish (Yeah)
¿Cómo se llama (Sí!), bonita? (Sí!)
Mi casa, su casa (Shakira, Shakira)
Oh baby, when you talk like that (Huh-uh) (Oh)
You know you got me hypnotized (Oh)
So be wise (Sí! Uh) and keep on (Sí! Uh)
Reading the signs of my body (Yeah)

[Bridge 2: Wyclef Jean & Shakira]
Señorita, feel the conga
Let me see you move like you come from Colombia
Yeah, oh, yeah, ladies, sí! (Yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
Mira, en Barranquilla se baila así, say it! (Yeah)
En Barranquilla se baila así (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Wyclef Jean with Shakira]
Yeah, she's so sexy, every man's fantasy
A refugee like me back with the Fugees from a third world country (Huh-uh)
I go back like when 'Pac carried crates for Humpty Humpty
We leave the whole club jazzy
Why the CIA wanna watch us?
It's the Colombians and Haitians
I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction
Bo-bop-so-bop, no more do we snatch ropes
Refugees run the seas, 'cause we own our own boats, boats (No fighting)

[Chorus: Shakira & Wyclef Jean]
I'm on tonight
My hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel you, boy
Come on, let's go, real slow
Baby, like this is perfecto (No fighting)
Oh, you know I'm on tonight
My hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
The attraction, the tension
Baby, like this is perfection

[Outro: Wyclef Jean & Shakira]
No fighting
No fighting

[Verse 1]
Lucky you were born that far away so
We could both make fun of distance
Lucky that I love a foreign land for
The lucky fact of your existence
Baby, I would climb the Andes solely
To count the freckles on your body
Never could imagine there were only
Ten million ways to love somebody

[Pre-Chorus]
Le ro lo le lo le, le ro lo le lo le
Can't you see? I'm at your feet

[Chorus 1]
Whenever, wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there and you'll be near
And that's the deal, my dear
Thereover, hereunder
You'll never have to wonder
We can always play by ear
But that's the deal, my dear

[Verse 2]
Lucky that my lips not only mumble
They spill kisses like a fountain
Lucky that my breasts are small and humble
So you don't confuse them with mountains
Lucky I have strong legs like my mother
To run for cover when I need it
And these two eyes that for no other
The day you leave will cry a river

[Pre-Chorus]
Le ro lo le lo le, le ro lo le lo le
At your feet
I'm at your feet

[Chorus 1]
Whenever, wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there and you'll be near
And that's the deal, my dear
Thereover, hereunder
You'll never have to wonder
We can always play by ear
But that's the deal, my dear

[Bridge]
Le ro le le lo le, le ro le le lo le
Think out loud, say it again
Le ro lo le lo le lo le
Tell me one more time
That you'll live
Lost in my eyes

[Chorus 2]
Whenever, wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there and you'll be near
And that's the deal, my dear
Thereover, hereunder
You've got me head over heels
There's nothing left to fear
If you really feel the way I feel

[Chorus 2]
Whenever, wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there and you'll be near
And that's the deal, my dear
Thereover, hereunder
You've got me head over heels
There's nothing left to fear
If you really feel the way I feel

I'll take you up in the sky, we'll be floating
Get you wet, like the ocean

[Verse 1]
Looking out for love
In the night so still
Oh, I'll build you a kingdom
In that house on the hill

[Chorus]
Looking out for love
Big, big love

[Verse 2]
You said that you love me
And that you always will
Oh, you beg me to keep you
In that house on the hill

Looking out for love
Big, big love

[Intro]
How are the tenders, Johnny?

[Verse]
Why don't you ask him if he's going to stay?
Why don't you ask him if he's going away?
Why don't you tell me what's going on?
Why don't you tell me who's on the phone?

Why don't you ask him what's going wrong?
Why don't you ask him who's the latest on his throne?
(Ooga-aga-ooga)

[Bridge]
Don't say that you love me (Hiyee)
Just tell me that you want me (Hiyee)
Tusk!
Just say that you want me (Hiyee)
Don't tell me that you--

[Outro]
Tusk!
(Real savage-like)
Tusk!
Tusk!
Tusk! Tusk! Tusk!

[Verse 1]
Don't be surprised if we try to be wise
Well, love is much more than good advice

[Chorus]
Oh, I rely all of my life
All of my life on my funny friends
Oh, I rely all of my life
All of my life on my funny friends

[Verse 2]
Who gives a damn if we throw the dice?
Well, love is much more than good advice

[Chorus]
Oh, I rely all of my life
All of my life on my funny friends
Oh, I rely all of my life
All of my life on my funny friends
Oh, I rely all of my life
All of my life on my funny friends
Oh, I rely all of my life
All of my life on my funny friends

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Oh, I rely all of my life
All of my life on my funny friends
Oh, I rely all of my life
All of my life on my funny friends

[Intro]
Usher, baby
I'm alone in this room
The only thing that's on my mind is you
I can't lie and say that I don't hear your call at night
Got something for you
Got plenty to go around
I guess I gotta remind you how I put it down

[Chorus]
There's too many women in here and I wanna love them all
Love them all, love them all
And I just can't pick one out of them, so I'ma love them all
Love them all, love them all

[Verse 1]
There's enough for me to go around up in this club, yeah
And there's enough for me to make sure I pleasure all these girls in this club, yeah
I'm gonna make sure it's fair
Gonna do you, you and you and you and then I'm gonna do her
Okay, let's get it straight, all my ladies get in line, yeah
I'ma take you back to school
Just raise your hand, girl, if you want me to get to you

[Chorus]
There's too many women in here and I wanna love them all
Love them all, love them all
And I just can't pick one out of them, so I'ma love them all
Love them all
'Cause they wanna love me, they wanna love me
They wanna love me, they wanna love me
'Cause they wanna love me, they wanna love me
They wanna love me, they wanna love me

[Verse 2]
These girls are gonna hate me if I give too much attention to one girl, yeah
So I might just have to double up, no, triple up, to make it through these girls, yeah
You kiss me here, touch me there, you move over, bring her here
All aboard, get up on this plane
I got a 747 kind of love, girl
And I can take you all over the world

[Chorus]
There's too many women in here and I wanna love them all
Love them all, love them all
And I just can't pick one out of them, so I'ma love them all
Love them all
'Cause they wanna love me, they wanna love me
They wanna love me, they wanna love me
'Cause they wanna love me, they wanna love me
They wanna love me, they wanna love me

[Verse 3]
Now usually, I'm a one-kind-of-girl kind of guy
Now, I'ma free-to-get-at-every-girl kind of guy
And if you down for that (I'm down)
Say, put me down for that (put me down)
I don't think you really hear me, baby
Let me break it down
'Cause lately I've been an all-up-in-love kind of guy
But now I'm a single-to-beat-it-up kind of guy
And if you down for that (I'm down)
Say, put me down for that (put me down)
Raise your hands in the air
If you want Usher, yeah

[Chorus]
There's too many women in here and I wanna love them all
Love them all, love them all
And I just can't pick one out of them, so I'ma love them all
Love them all
'Cause they wanna love me, they wanna love me
They wanna love me, they wanna love me
'Cause they wanna love me, they wanna love me
They wanna love me, they wanna love me

[Outro]
They wanna love me, they wanna love me
They wanna love me, they wanna love me

[Intro]
I'm lovin' it (ba da, ba ba ba)
I'm lovin' it (ba da, ba ba ba)
I'm lovin' it (ba da, ba ba ba)
Don't you love it too?

[Verse 2]
Yo
Hi, I'm not here to waste your time
You know this ain't a pick-up line
I just think that you're a dime
We'll just sit there, girl

[Chorus]
Well I know that heart that's in your chest
It carries pain and so much stress
But you got to let it go (Go, go, girl)
Just close your eyes, I'll grab your waist
Next think you know you have your pace
Girl you got to let it go (Go, go, girl)
I know that you wanna get down
You do deserve to get down
Been working hard all week
Just trying to make your money
Girl, go on and shake your booty
I'm lovin' it, I'm lovin' it
I'm lovin' it (ba da, ba ba ba)
I'm lovin' it (ba da, ba ba ba)

[Verse 2]
By the way, what's your sign?
I bet it is compatible with mine
Probably long lasting years down the line
I'm telling you, girl, you're a dime
We'll just sit there, girl

[Chorus]
Well I know that heart that's in your chest
It carries pain and so much stress
But you got to let it go (Go, go, girl)
Just close your eyes, I'll grab your waist
Next think you know you have your pace
Girl you got to let it go (Go, go, girl)

[Bridge]
Oh...
(Remember)
Oh...
(The first time we met)
Oh...
(Butterflies in your stomach)
Oh...
(Couldn't speak)
Oh...
(You)
Oh...
(Close your eyes)
Oh...
(It's ok)
Oh...
(I was lovin' it)
Oh...
'

[Verse 3]
How, how you do all the things you do? (How you do it?)
Like being you, you're so professional (Professional)
Not to mention, you're the baddest of your group
We'll just sit there, girl

[Chorus]
I know that you wanna get down
You do deserve to get down (Wanna get down)
Been working hard all week (Oh, yeah)
Just trying to make your money (Money)
Girl go on and shake your booty
I'm lovin' it (ba da, ba ba ba)
I'm lovin' it (ba da, ba ba ba)
(Hey..)
I'm lovin' it (ba da, ba ba ba)
(Hey..)
I'm lovin' it (ba da, ba ba ba)
(Oh...)
Don't you love it too?

[Chorus]
I'm too high, I'm too high
But I ain't touched the sky
I'm too high, I'm too high
But I ain't touched the sky

[Verse 1]
She's a girl in a dream
She sees a four eyed cartoon monster on the T.V. screen
She takes another puff and says "It's a crazy scene"
That red is green and she's a tangerine

[Chorus]
I'm too high, I'm too high
But I ain't left the ground
I'm too high, I'm too high
I hope I never ever come down

[Verse 2]
She's the girl in her life
But her world's a superficial paradise
She had a chance to make it big more than once or twice
But no dice, she wasn't very nice

[Chorus]
I'm too high, I'm too high
I can't ever touch the sky
I'm too high, I'm so high
I feel like I'm about to die

[Verse 3]
She's a girl of the past
I guess that I got to her at last
And did you hear the news about the girl today?
She passed away, what did her friend say?

[Outro]
They said she's too high, too high
Can't hang around anyway...

[Verse 1]
It was just before dawn one miserable
Morning in black Forty-Four
When the forward commander was told to sit tight
When he asked that his men be withdrawn
And the Generals gave thanks as the other ranks
Held back the enemy tanks for a while
And the Anzio bridgehead was held for the price
Of a few hundred ordinary lives

[Verse 2]
And kind old King George sent Mother a note
When he heard that Father was gone
It was, I recall, in the form of a scroll
With gold leaf and all
And I found it one day
In a drawer of old photographs, hidden away
And my eyes still grow damp to remember
His Majesty signed with his own rubber stamp

[Verse 3]
It was dark all around, there was frost in the ground
When the Tigers broke free
And no one survived
From the Royal Fusiliers Company Z
They were all left behind
Most of them dead, the rest of them dying
And that's how the High Command
Took my daddy from me

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Uh, said this a hit of liquid heroin
Marilyn Manson channelin'
Panickin', spar with Anakin
'Til one of us leave in an ambulance
Blow the smoke of the spliff in your eyes
You ain't gon' live 'til you die
Intelligent bitch on my side
She bitchin', I'm spittin' habitual lies
I hit her up when my jet land (Call her)
Got a Swisher tucked in my headband (Baller)
Front page news, I'm young Jesus
Eatin' bagels with no cable on (Let's go)
Been fuckin' hoes since when Mase was on (Okay)
I hope the Based God hear my prayers (Pray)
One day you're here, the next day you're gone
So me and Earl smokin' weed on Jay-Z's lawn
Some dope rap on your ho ass, Tony Womack
Don't hold back, no, feed your girl Cognac (Woah)
Meet a bitch, sleepin' wit' her, feverish, diva chick
Met her off Twitter, even Schindler keep a list (Okay)
Pittsburgh, broke down somewhere in a Fisker (Uh-huh)
I could pull your bitch with a whisper (Uh-huh), then diss her (Woah)
Dumbass ho (Ho)
She only dumb 'cause she love that dough (Okay)
Somewhere gettin' high readin' Juxtapoz
Hit her up, she come through, watch Adjustment Bureau
(That's a good movie)
Moms love me 'cause I'm so commercial ('Mercial)
I fuck 'em raw 'cause I know they fertile (Fertile)
In Myrtle Beach with a purple fleece (Fleece)
Hotel lobbies playin' Für Elise (Yeah)
I'm Ron Burgundy mixed with Hercules
Slap a bitch in the mouth if she curse at me (Ow)
Said Josh beard is like Paul Revere
When he walk in the room it's like God is here
I'm at a prop shop in Montauk throwin' tomahawks at civilians
I'm chillin', yeah

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
I'm on the monitor, nigga
She takin' it like a champ and I'm proud of her, nigga
I'm on the couch where that loud is burnin'
I'm shoutin', "I don't fuck with you," 'cause I don't
Never love a ho
But we could play doctor, ma, open wide for thermometer
Your cowgirl is crotch ridin' (Nigga)
With a clean, faded fro, lopsided (Uh)
Tell the label that I want a white driver (Uh)
And tell him give me space, I don't know that nigga (Nigga)
Bold-ass little fuckin' low-class villian (Villain)
Whole van tinted (Tinted), nope, can't kill him (No)
It's the Trashwang nigga (Nigga), that's what's up (Nigga)
Half pint of hope in that plastic cup (Come on)
Real nigga from the start 'til the casket shut (Uh)
Present his own case, he's a basket one (One)
Present-day based nigga, smack the judge (Judge)
Ridin' with them same niggas, ashin' blunts
While that bass make his face like he mad or somethin' (Uh)
Slide in the safe, take the cash and run (Run)
Know that if he fake I'm harrassin' him
Took the big toe so they tagged the tongue
Out here stuntin' like I'm supposed to, dog (Dog)
Blowin' more smoke than a broke exhaust
Pipe only spirit that I hold menthol (Uh)
It's Wolf Gang, bitch, like you know these paws
Livin' like it's '62 (Uh), spit and grip my genitals (Uh)
My bitch just split the Swisher, my niggas split them residuals

[Outro: Earl Sweatshirt]
Hey, it's marijuana fields, pot growin'
Blarin' Gil Scott Heron while we pill pop
Errand run and kill cop
Niggas know I feel not for 'em, stop bitchin', bruh
Stare and get that grill knocked open
Hey, it's marijuana fields, pot growin'
Blarin' Gil Scott Heron while we pill pop
Errand run and kill cop
Niggas know I feel not for 'em, stop bitchin', bruh
Stare and get that grill knocked open... nigga

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe; bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe; bitch, don't kill my vibe

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside of my soul
And you can find gold and maybe get rich
Hol' up
Trinidad Jame$ in four weeks
But now my album platinum and shit, so what?
Y'all keep the numbers
I'm more than another statistic, my nigga
This courtesy of Compton (Courtesy of Compton)
Brooklyn go hard, motherfucker
Love me on the East like I'm Chuck D
Dominicans wish that I was born there
I'm lookin' to be the god MC
You look at my hat and see thorns there
I look at the game and see porn there
I'm fuckin' this industry hard
I'm bagging this money, tea-bagging your honey
You thought I was fresh out the yard
Don't cry to me dummy, you're a lightweight
They tell me you nice and I'm like "wait"
Go get me a knife, you're looking like steak
And when the stakes are high, I stake out for days
And when the water reside, you're Bobby Boucher
But we ain't thirsty nigga, never alert me, nigga
I got a P89 in a suitcase
I know you heard me, nigga, this is a burpee, nigga
Lyrical exercise, right now, homie, I'm in the extra vibe
Pipe down, on the curb, when you heard that I got these words
To the upper echelon, that's excellent (That's excellent)

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch don't kill my vibe, bitch don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it but today I'm yelling
Bitch, don't kill my vibe; bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe; bitch, don't kill my vibe

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Up in the clouds, me and my spouse
Rumors on the ground gettin' too loud
Please turn them shits down, can't hear myself think
Turbulence, shit, almost spilled my drink
In the White House with a mink
Running through that bitch like it's my house
All up in the hall like a mall
Told you motherfuckers, all I do is ball
No, I don't 'member you, I don't intend to
Empty my memory bank
It's a million dollars in it, baby, Hilary Swank
Sittin' next to Hillary smellin' like dank
Presidential pardon, name one nigga out there harder than him
I'll wait
I've been in my wave like 20 years straight
I've been on my vibe like 20 years straight
Don't fuck up my high, fuck up my high
Nights like this, I could fuck up a pie
An still be straight (still be straight)
Fall back, bitch, I got a lot on my plate
Don't waste my breath
I don't know how many moons a nigga got left
Back to this joint, smokin' this shit like I'm tryna' prove a point
I'm the highest, the highest title, numero uno
Kill my vibe, that's your motherfuckin' funeral

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Between you and me, turn eulogy to urinals, niggas pissed off
I ministered this generation by far
Leader of the new school
On my toes like a ballerina, who knew I'd be Black Swan?
World in my palms, ironically
I am the Globetrotters' best 'cause I didn't drop the ball
Told niggas when I was 16
That I'd write a 16 to put a nigga right on the big screen
In the paddy wagon with six teens
Should have been in the pen
But now my pen write with morphine
I heal niggas, touch down with more fiends
I kill niggas, audio crack, khakis to meal ticket
Cardio lap, was running for dear life
But now I'm running the map, bitch, I'm here nigga
Picture lil' ole me giving a fuck for what a fuck nigga gotta say
Nigga, you never be Jay, never be Nas, never be Snoop nor Dre
You ain't get killed in Vegas or in a Suburban
Nigga, Puff Daddy wasn't your favorite
So many washed up with detergent
But I don't dry tears, I just aim at them on purpose
Like blah, Mini-14 like blah
Empty out another magazine like blah
Let a young nigga get by (Doot!)
I kill 'em all when they try to kill my vibe (Doot! Doot!)
I am the bad, the good god, the last the hood got
The last that would try to pass a good job
If Shawn's a black Beatle then I need a 10 second drum solo
Bitch see you at Woodstock, ah!

[Hook]
Imagine how it would be
To be at the top making cash money
Go and tour all around the world
Tell stories about all the young girls
Imagine how it would be
To be at the top making cash money
Go and tour all around the world
Tell stories about all the young girls

[Verse 1]
?, 'bout to go down
Arms won’t ?, pocket full of pounds
Text up Mags, tell him we in town
Call up Sway, tell him to come round
Show sold out, so get on down
Bungalow 8, where we go now?
Estelle in the house, twins are too
279 on the ones and twos
And the house is now insane
Look around might see ? and ?
Feelin real ? give a pound to Jane
And hurry because ? shout my name
Aw mane get us back to Hiro
Man look how far back my seat go
Goyard bag just full of beach clothes
Cause the next show right on the seashore

[Hook]
Imagine how it would be
To be at the top making cash money
Go and tour all around the world
Tell stories about all the young girls
Imagine how it would be
To be at the top making cash money
Go and tour all around the world

[Verse 2]
Now we down under, 'bout to make it jump
Sydney’s prettiest fans in the front
Hip-hop show but act like it’s punk
1500s drop the beat at once
Came for one show might stay for a month
Exchange rate sucks make sure everything’s spent
No time to pack, now we in the crunch
Leave it all behind, be in Paris by brunch
We’ll just re-up and say ?
Dior and Mastermind is on me
Hit Generation drop a couple frees
Later that night everybody say oui!
(Yes!) Bocu merci
Right after that is when we flee
Madison Square, New York City
Kick it with Ed Lover, flirt with Angie
Let’s go!

[Hook]
Imagine how it would be
To be at the top making cash money
Go and tour all around the world
Tell stories about all the young girls
Imagine how it would be
To be at the top making cash money
Go and tour all around the world
Tell stories about all the young girls

[Verse 3]
We missed the cheap steaks and other Americanas
Stop in Chicago just to kiss my momma
Now everybody hop back on the bus
Whole bunch of models chasing behind us
'Til the dinner supper everybody go nuts
Especially in Houston, Bun B whatup?
The whole west coast really give me a rush
Seattle shown up ?
Take a break in Maui, rent out a villa
Then lean back up I’m a passport killa
Pop up in Japan like my name was Godzilla
With the whole swagger clean having Harajuku  taking pictures
Yeah and who knows where we are next?
Just keep your fingers crossed 'til you see our jet
In my Trilly Truly jeans and my DRX
Keep your hands in the air, better be impressed
Now let’s go!

[Hook]
Imagine how it would be
To be at the top making cash money
Go and tour all around the world
Tell stories about all the young girls

[Verse 1]
Summertime sadness
I feel India in my bones
I can smell sunlight
I can feel the highline
Bless me
Gods bless me
Goddess of Forbidden Love
I am she
I keep one white candle
Maintain
Purity, purity

[Chorus]
Show me the way to your hiding place
I think I wanna go go there
Show me the way to your hiding place
I think I wanna go go go go there
Go to church if you scared

[Verse 2]
I lay formless
Hands tied in my sheets
Star signs say I'm rare
Chosen
By who
I-I-I-I-I
I wonder who's watchin'
Whose wing I'm under
Sweep me up and I'll go
No questions take me
I'll go!

[Chorus]
Show me the way to your hiding place
I think I wanna go go there
Show me the way to your hiding place
I think I wanna go go go go there
Go to church if you scared

[Outro]
Show me the way
Yea yea yea
Yea yea yea
Yea yea yea

[Intro]
This here is the epic tale of a broken mind
This here, this here is the epic tale of a broken mind
This here, this here is the epic tale, this here is the epic tale

[Refrain]
And I'll be by your side
And I'll be by your side

[Verse 1]
I hear my thoughts, I hear them creep
And into my mind, into my dreams
Voices in my head save me
Untie my hands, untie my feet
So I might fly, so I might fly
I might fly

[Chorus 1]
This here is the epic tale of a broken mind
This, this here's the epic tale
This here is the epic tale of a broken mind, oh
This, this here's the epic tale
This here is the epic tale of a broken mind, broken mind
This, this here's the epic tale

[Refrain]
And I'll be by your side
And I'll be by your side

[Verse 2]
Like clouds under my feet, I try not to think
Not to feel like I'm stuck in this space, I'm just me
I'm just so much more, so much more, so much
I'm so much more, I feel I'm so much more
(Feel like I'm so much more, more)

[Chorus 2]
One day I’ll live, how I lost my mind
One day if I live to tell the tale
One day if I live, how I lost my mind
One day, one day I’ll live
One day I'll live to tell the tale of how I lost my mind
One day I'll live
One day I'll live, I'll tell the tale of how I lost my mind
One day I'll live

[Refrain]
And I'll be by your side
And I'll be by your side

[Chorus 3]
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be by your side
Won't go no where, I'll stay right here by your side
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be right here by your side
Won't go nowhere, I'll stay right here
Be, I'll be right here by your side
Won't go nowhere, I'll be right her by your

[Outro]
Lost my mind, can't seem to find it, but I'll be here
But I'll be here though

[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
You live, forever

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
How 'bout them bullets ain't slow you up?
You ain't really died and we watched you grow up
At 12 months you took your first steps
Awkwardly across the kitchen floor to your best
Your first breaths that we can call words
Were in your father's lap on November 23rd
And they were, "Live for me", and he did for you
Flipped to Neutron and stayed inside the crib for you
And this commitment from your father
Imparted a deep sense of value you forever harbor
We were all so proud as we seen you getting smarter
And the bond grow deeper between a mother and a daughter
Cause you were not a martyr
(You live)

[Hook 1: Apparat]
Find out, I was just a bad dream
Goodbye

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
At six, you started reading whole books
At seven, you knew how a brain looked
And could roughly describe, all the different regions
Could tell when we was sick and even knew the reason
The world wasn't at peace, gunfire every weekend
But you were hardly there, cause you was always leaving
Field museum, planetarium, aquarium
You saw something special in that tank you were starin' in
And in those moments, as a little girl
You realized there was a bigger world
Bigger than the South Side, bigger than Chicago
You were bigger, still wanted rims on your car though
And big ass woofers in your car door
So you could wang like your daddy at the park eating sharks
Went to King where you were teased for being smart
Where you bumped into Hadiya teaching art
You live forever

[Hook 2: Apparat]
Find out, I was just a bad dream
Neither ever, nor never, goodbye
Neither ever, nor never, goodbye
Neither

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
At sixteen is when you got your scholarship
At twenty-two is when you got your doctorate
Even now it's kind of hard to believe
But your father taught you work hard, and achieve
And you complied
Accepted by every medical school you applied
But the coolest thing is when they offered you that high paying slot, you replied
"They need me in the hood," and that's where you reside
Free clinic, nobody denied
And that's where you heard the shots and quickly ran outside
And saw a man and a van and a bleeding baby in his hands
Fading fast, but you knew she could survive
Did everything you could to keep this girl alive
Stabilized until the ambulance arrived
And in that moment, where you gave your help
I bet you didn't know that you saved yourself

[Outro: Apparat & Lupe Fiasco]
Fold down your hands, give me a sign
Hooked on your lies
You live, forever
Lay down next to me, don't listen when I scream
Bury your doubts and fall asleep
Lord have mercy

[Verse 1]
Summers coming back and I wanna take you to the river
We've got our river rafts and our tire tubes to keep us up on top
And float, and float
And float, and float
Down stream

[Verse 2]
Ride on our two wheels
To deal or no deal
Dig through the dusty shed
I couldn't forget
All the drugs we did
They made us feel so good
We can walk to the parking lot of the mom and pop diner
Not one night was wasted
Not one night was wasted
I need you

[Outro]
Anybody
Oh, give me anybody
Oh, give me anybody
Oh, give me anybody

[Verse 1]
I wish you would have smiled in the bakery
Or sat on a tatty settee
At a mutual friend's gathering
And the more you keep on looking, the more it's hard to take
Love, we're in stalemate
To never meet is surely where we're bound
There's one in every town
Just there to grind you down

[Verse 2]
I wish I would have seen you in the post office
Well, maybe I did and I missed it
Too busy with the mind on clever lines
Why not the rounders pitch or the canteen?
You're slacking, love, where have you been?
Just had to go and wait until tonight

[Bridge]
To give me the invite
Don't worry, it's alright

[Verse 3]
I wish I would have seen you down in the arcade
Sipping on a lemonade
In the paper cup and chewing on the straw
And I wish I'd seen you in the bakery
But if I'd seen you in the bakery
You probably wouldn't have seen me

[Verse 1]
There’s something about your body
I’m not in a rush
But girl I’m ready to marry you
Yeah right here in the restaurant
And start on our honeymoon
While you still got your dress on
While you still got your dress on

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I ain’t trying to offend nobody
But girl dont they see you
It’s cool if they don’t
Cus hey I only see me and you
That’s why I’m all over you
While you still got your dress on
While you still got your dress on

[Chorus]
I can’t wait
Cus girl as soon as I look at your face
I see a world where our heart never breaks
To me that means that the whole world could change but not mine
I can’t wait

[Verse 2]
The way I know your body
I don’t really need much
Girl I know where to touch
Stay where you are
Drop all your worries
And you can leave all the rest on
We can do it
While you still have your dress on

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I ain’t trying to offend nobody
But girl dont they see you
It’s cool if they don’t
Cus hey I only see me and you
That’s why I’m all over you
While you still got your dress on
While you still got your dress on

[Chorus]
I can’t wait
Cus girl as soon as I look at your face
I see a world where our heart never breaks
To me that means that the whole world could change but not mine
I can’t wait

[Verse 3: Timbaland]
Let me take you
So walk with me
Through the beautiful sand as we take pictures
Hips so wide looks like it’s got whiskers
Let put a solid gold on that solid figure
Go ahead show your pretty dentures
Your pretty physique, your pretty toes
I’m pretty with you
I do a good job for that pretty picture
You the prettiest but I’m the only thing that’s missing

[Chorus]
I can’t wait
Cus girl as soon as I look at your face
I see a world where our heart never breaks
To me that means that the whole world could change but not mine
I can’t wait

[Intro]
Ooh, yeah, alright

So jam by my side

[Outro]

I wanna jam it;

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
I'm single in the streets 'bout to get it in
Talking bout some drinking and some mingling (Woah)
Can't believe what I'm seeing, man, all these girls, look (Right), look (Right)
Hmm, they got me caught y'all, I just wanna make her feel hot
Let me smell your sin girl damn you look (Right) so (Right)
No groupies, see a blonde girl with a brunette
See a nigga cruising in the red benz
That's a one, two, double up, triple up
So many surprises oh so many colors and sizes
Love them, I want them, they need me
I'm rolling, coasting

[Chorus]
I see pretty girls everywhere I go
Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go
So many colors and sizes, so many surprises
So many colors and sizes, so many surprises
So many colors and sizes, so many surprises
So many colors and sizes, so many surprises
(Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go)

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Guess what
A nigga turnt up
All the windows closed for the roast up
Club club letting out finna post up
All I need is somebody to fly with and smoke this tree
Down for doing acid
Slim up on that waist, but that ass fit (Wow)
Let me feel your skin on mine unwind speak whats on your mind
And tell me somethin that moves me
Seen all types, different continents
Nothing more intriguing than an accent
That's a one, two, double up, get it up
So many surprises, so many colors and sizes
Love it (Mmh) they're so dope, they're so dope
We're all rolling, coasting

[Chorus]
I see pretty girls everywhere I go
Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go

(So many colors and sizes, so many surprises)
Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
When you live like me you get used to fun
There's an endless supply of the beautiful ones
Open up those exotic thighs
The baddest little bitch half-Black, half-Thai
Don’t be prejudiced, cause she’s mixed
I'd still fuck the blackest bitch
That's how it is if you in my world
Light skin, white momma you a white girl
And I got that fever
And a big thick you know what I wanna feed her
Met a girl named Maria, its your turn, I love them señoritas
I like to fuck 'em, then I say fuck 'em
Lil momma can get a little something
OG Too Short don't stop
All the pretty girls call me Todd

[Chorus]
I see pretty girls everywhere I go
Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go
(Let me see that body!)
I see pretty girls everywhere I go
Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go

Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go

Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go

[Outro]
They love me
Yahm

[Too $hort]
Bitch!
What's up, shorty? You still hangin' 'round this bitch, huh?
Man, I told you I gotta do me, shawty
Say, what's up with all them people 'round here?
Man, I told you them niggas was wiggin' off them pills 'round here
Who dat?
Man, they left ol' boy leakin' last night
What boy was this?
Man, you know that bitch used to be swingin' 'round the block in all them whips, bitch thinkin' he Stunna and shit
Man, ain't that cold? What you 'bout to get into?
Man, I'm gon' listen to Tha Carter II, fuck this bullshit
Smoke one with a nigga

[Verse 1]
(Aight, aight...Uh...Slim Shady...Yo, yo, yo...)
It's only fair to warn, I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my damn umbilical cord
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a two by four board
And smash into your Honda Accord with a 4-door Ford
But I'm more toward droppin' an acapella
To chop a fella into mozzarella worse than a helicopter propeller
Got you locked in the cellar with your skeleton showing
Developing anorexia while I'm standin' next to ya
Eating a four course meal, watching you starve to death
With an IV in your veins, feeding you liquid Darvocet
Pumping you full of drugs
Pull the plugs
On the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up in an ambulance
And driven
To receiving with the asses ripped outta they pants
And given
A less than 20 percent chance
Of living
Have a possible placement
As a hospital patient
Storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived
To perform an autopsy on you while you scream "I'M STILL ALIVE!"
Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp, and
Pullin' your Adam's apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department
I've hired a arson
To set fire to carpet
And burn up your entire apartment
I'm a liar to start shit
Got your bitch wrapped around my dick
So tight you need a crowbar to pry her apart with
Motherfucker, Slim Shady bitch! Recognize!

[Verse 2]
Met a retarded kid named Greg, with a wooden leg
Snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg
Go to bed with the keg, wake up with the 40
Mixed it with Alka-Seltzer and Formula 44D
Fuck an acid tab, I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead
Wait until it absorbed in, and fell to the floor dead
No more said, case closed, end of discussion
I'm blowin' up like spontaneous human combustion
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
Cross the bombers
We blowin' up your house, killing your parents
And coming back to get your foster mommas
And I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nostradamus
Cause I ain't making no more threats
I'm doin' drive-by's in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets
I'm more or less sick in the head
Maybe more cause I smoked crack
Today, yesterday, and the day before
Saboteur, walk the block with a Labrador
Strappin' more corral for war than El Salvador
Foul style galore
Verbal cow manure
Comin' together like the eyebrow on Al B. Sure!
Motherfucker!

[Verse 3]
(Like this, like that, like this
Like this, like that, like this)
I'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless, patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beating James Todd Sr
And smackin' his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in a wild hood
As a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood
That I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed
I kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that I failed 9th grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person, don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of death
As I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind
You and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge, and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not? Blow your brain out
I'm blowing mine out
Fuck it, you only live once, you might as well die now

[Verse 4]
Yo, yo, yo!
My mom sent me up to the store with a food stamp
For a pack of cigarettes and a book at the news stand (here)
Two dudes ran up and jumped out of a blue van
I looked down at the ground and picked up a huge branch
I swung it at the first dude, the other one with him
Seen it snap so fast, it looked like it broke before it hit him
So he tried to rush, I swept his legs, pinned him, and bit him
He came back with 6 or 7 dudes screaming "GET HIM!"
I grabbed one,  lit him on fire, pinned, and bit him
The next faggot gave me his shoes like they didn't fit him
One by one I just kept dropin' 'em in a rhythm
Then I woke up swingin' the middle of the kitchen

(Damn... damn... damn...)

[Intro: Timbaland]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

But my train is on your track now
So watch out

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
With the music in the lights in the middle of the night
I’m gettin’ my way like a kid in a candy store

And by the end of the night when you hot like a light
It'll be cause you and me burned up the floor
And if you're on what I'm on, then you already know, c'mon

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
That’s what I’m talkin’ 'bout
Waitress 'til she got that tip
Sailor until I sunk that ship
Yeah, I had a hot little fire girl
But now she just smoke, that’s it
And I ain’t gon' stop 'til I get you out on top of this list

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
With the music in the lights in the middle of the night
I’m gettin’ my way like a kid in a candy store
I think you got what I want
And by the end of the night when you hot like a light
It'll be cause you and me burned up the floor
And if you're on what I'm on, then you already know, c'mon

[Verse 1]
Sank into their calculations and snorted on a stench
Of their arithmetic
Look for the boy who was hanging his head low
More trophies and ideas to follow their pretend

[Chorus]
With a scowl in his pocket and a smile on his face
He followed with obedience and fell in the nettles

[Verse 2]
Afterwards those spiky whispers said he brought his own rope
And skipped the bits they loathed
Didn’t scramble to find a dock leaf and capture back our hope
To advice, his mind had closed
He lost all of his foot holes

[Chorus]
And with a scowl in his pocket and a smile on his face
He followed with obedience and fell in the nettles
Fell in the nettles, fell in the nettles

[Verse 3]
He was a toothpick and the garlic and the cinder upon the path
Had failed to blunt or hinder the slow collapse
And clinging to the door frame, he was trapped
Off to a reminder of where he had been

[Chorus]
With a smile in his pocket and a scowl on his face
There was nowhere to flee, so sat content in the nettles

[Hook]
Ya'll dont wanna see them pop pops when this on
Cause if niggas get them pop pops
Then they gone
You know i dont pop pop at the bar
But i might send pop pops through your car
Ya'll dont want them pop pops when this on
Cause if niggas get them pop pops
Then they gone
Who is that kid with the jewels in his face
With the tools in his brace
Put the tool in your face

[Verse 1]
Got the police the hustlers and the gangstas nervous
And all these little rappers on basic service, I'm knowin
I ain't the hottest nigga out got that fire though
You gone have to put your hottest nigga out
And i ain't talkin bout when the partys over
I'm a moltov cocktail bicardi thrower
Fifteen karrot bezzled out bigari holder
Size ten alligator skin Mari loafers
And I'm just like the cops, word to the life
Cause i serve and protect
Wit a bird and a tech
And when the lights on
Gotta merge to the right
Sixteen drop in new jers

[ey]in with rice
Or in chicagow with the truck
Or in the valow with the luck
Or in lala with chuck
Or in Ghana gettin' ducks
Or in Jamaica speakin' patois in the huts

[Hook]
Ya'll dont wanna see them pop pops when this on
Cause if niggas get them pop pops
Then they gone
You know i dont pop pop at the bar
But i might send pop pops through your car
Ya'll dont want them pop pops when this on
Cause if niggas get them pop pops
Then they gone
Who is that kid with the jewelry on his arm
With the fury in his palm
Got the fury all along

[Verse 2]
Fiasco fiasco
Send shots ten blocks
Split tops i rent cops
And bend blocks and Benz drops
I been hot now shake spot
Or take shot like hen rock
My gridlock on big blocks that miss not that a
Tip yachts and flip drops
So spit out the hip hot
The wrist watch rock don't risk it watch in the ristwat with chics who sip ---
Livin so cris pop my clique cop pot
Your clique get kidknocked
Your clique stop

Send hustler to my hustlers locked in jin pop and they able to switch spots there is not
Stand back hand clap kick stomp

[Hook]
Ya'll dont wanna see them pop pops when this on
Cause if niggas get them pop pops
Then they gone
You know i dont pop pop at the bar
But i might send pop pops through your car
Ya'll dont want them pop pops when this on
Cause if niggas get them pop pops
Then they gone
Who is that kid with the jewelry on his arm
With the fury in his palm
Got the jewelry all along

[Intro]
Baby, I'm so sorry I'm late
It's been such a long day
I went to go get my nails done, I went shopping
And I'm in love with these shoes
I can't want for you to see me in them on (You're welcome)
I'm so happy to see you *muah* (You are, you are, you are, you're welcome)
How was your day?
Come in, relax
Let your hair down, please
For me, for me, for me, for me, for me

[Verse]
Ooh, you're so fine, so happy, you're mine, my girl
Your presence is a gift and I don't wanna waste no time
So tell me what you need and I got it
Material, is it physical, sexual, intellectual? Let me know
Girl, I've been waiting all day and all night
For you to come and get right, in my life
You play a special part
And I'm giving you all my heart
Are you giving me yours, I'm asking?
The liquor got me giving you the passion
Say that you'll forever be my baby
The liquor got me feeling so crazy
I never wanna think about the next girl
'Cause you made me forget about my ex-girl

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Wake up in the morning feelin' so damn good, oh man music’s so good to me
Me and my niggas bout to kick it with some bitches, and you know we bout to roll some trees
I’m feelin' it... you feelin' it
I’m feelin' it... you feelin' it
M.O.E., M.O.E., music over everything
M.O.E., M.O.E., music over everything
M.O.E., M.O.E., music over everything
M.O.E., M.O.E., music over everything

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Uh Taking my time to perfect the beats
And I still got love for the streets, king gold chains
And my nigga Wiz Khalifa, got trip in a drink
Couple bad bitches, they just want VIP
You played her fo real? Don’t bring her around me
Got girls left up in the backseat
Runnin like track meet, that’s me, leather on the 6th speed
Love it when she got her own shit together
Got shit to lose, then she with whatever
Always out of town, she my distant lover
Only pull in driveways with tints and better
Gold rims, we ghetto, on the chase for cheddar
From a jet runway, I can land wherever
Make more in a day than your salary
Nigga why you mad at me? Talk cheap, I don’t lose sleep
Man I...

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Wake up in the morning feelin' so damn good, oh man music’s so good to me
Me and my niggas bout to kick it with some bitches, and you know we bout to roll some trees
I’m feelin' it... you feelin' it
I’m feelin' it... you feelin' it
M.O.E., M.O.E., music over everything
M.O.E., M.O.E., music over everything
M.O.E., M.O.E., music over everything
M.O.E., M.O.E., music over everything

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
I roll up that Mary J, my favorite song playin'
My clothes from the runway, my kush come from the land
You’s a baller or a hustler then you know what I’m sayin'
Them haters they talkin, hear em talk, I don’t care
I’m rollin'
Probably doin 95, smoking getting mighty high
Rolling weed since ’99, smoke so much I’ll probably fly
If I don’t smoke I’ll probably die
I’m holdin'
Grippin' on the steering wheel, listening to my favorite jam
Ridin through Hollywood, I’m feeling like the fuckin man
Hundred grand to see me, kinda fore I go to sleep
That’s why I…

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Wake up in the morning feelin' so damn good, oh man music’s so good to me
Me and my niggas bout to kick it with some bitches, and you know we bout to roll some trees
I’m feelin' it... you feelin' it
I’m feelin' it... you feelin' it
M.O.E., M.O.E., music over everything
M.O.E., M.O.E., music over everything
M.O.E., M.O.E., music over everything
M.O.E., M.O.E., music over everything

[Verse 3: Tyga]
Drive fast til I'm out of gas
Getting money like this, can’t look back
She a one night stand, tryna make it last
But I be out of town soon as I hit that
15 stacks runways, living lavish, big carats
You ain't getting money like that
I put rhymes on the beat, T-Rawws on the feet
Don’t hate me ‘cause I’m where you wanna be
I do mostly what the minimum do
So my girls might be yours times 22
Ride 22 2’s and I chunk up the deuce
Everything great like a nigga Babe Ruth
Translucent roof, but her dress seem through
She just tryna make it, guess you gotta do what you gotta do
Shit I ain't gonna judge you
But don't expect me to love you, feelin' it?

[Chorus]
Bitch, I'm in the club
With the homies, tell me what's good
I'm tryna get these hoes single
And this is my single

[Verse 1]
Okay, what these niggas hollin' 'bout?
Catastrophic K-Dot, bet I bring them dollas out
Talk that shit, potty mouth, walk that shit, pep stroke
Guarantee yo girl, get sliced like Kimbo
Bitch, I'm in the club, homies blowin' indo
Turned up, throwin' up signs to the ceiling roof
Sipping on that hundred proof and I'm dressed in Gucci too
And these hoes jock a nigga so I holla, "What it do?"

[Chorus]
Where you at? Bitch, I'm in the club

[Verse 2]
Move somethin', move, move somethin'
Got these stacks full of hundreds with an icon woman
On my left, my right, my right, my left, I'm throwed
Beyonce's, two Halle's and three Keyshia Cole's
Wait a minute (Wait a minute), can I pop my tags? (Pop my tags)
Can I do the fool? (Do the fool) Can I swing my rag? (Swing my rag)
I'm a Hub City maniac, bitch, get it right
Bartender, hurry up, put them bottles on ice

[Chorus]
Bitch, I'm in the club
With the homies, tell me what's good
I'm tryna get these hoes single
And this is my single

[Verse 3]
I got a hundred dollas on me (I'm rich, bitch)
Baby girl, I know you wanted (This dick)
All righty I might be in some loafers or Nikes
Faded blazer or white tee, either way she gon' like me
I get it crackin' for no reason at all
Lookin' you see that I ball like a pupil that's soft
And I can tell you don't have what I have
Which is a lot of juice, motherfuck swag

[Chorus]
Where you at? Bitch, I'm in the club
With the homies, tell me what's good
I'm tryna get these hoes single
And this is my single
Where you at? Bitch, I'm in the club
With the homies, tell me what's good
I'm tryna get these hoes single
And this is my single

[Outro]

[Verse 1 - Lupe Fiasco]
You know wassup now
I stroll through the underworld in my uptowns
Til im over the hill
I push touch downs
It's over, I'm healed
I put my crutch down
My vision is clear
The central divison is here
They should give him a flare
Give him a float
Then give him the floor
Just gimme my ye
Gimme a yard
I give u a year
Lean on the yacht cap/ lean on the yacht cat
Gimme ya oars/ gimme your yarn

[Verse 2 - Lupe Fiasco]
Im rappin the gift
And the remedy dog
Its what I shimmy down ur chimneys for
Money drop
Ur pennies from the penthouse
Im fifty twenties from the twentieth floor
They waitin on the downfall
Of a g, like ground floor
But ima be like philly blunt
Right here like right ear
Grindin like ground beef til me and the ground meet
I get it crunk

[Hook - Lupe Fiasco]
Over the hills and through the hoods we go
With the F to the I to the A S C O
FI-IIIIIIII-ASCO, hey
Where ya goin?
Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lupe

[Verse 3 - Lupe Fiasco]
They should break in the company and take him in custody
For takin sumthin so basic and makin it uppity
So publicly so what if he hold something so stubbornly
So grudgingly up in here for something that he does so lovingly
From waitin in the basement so humbly so hungrily
Now its finna get so ugly, so utterly unpretty
So witty and so cunningly is he and there's no budgin me
Its like im next in line, theres no cuttin me
And its like I never next to nine
I never next in nine, well I never
Hold a rifle like motorcycle
You know, where bad chicks sit
Keep a nine around my waist, like ninja back seat
I mean I heat pack, like injured athlete
So sit on back, before she get on back

[Hook - Lupe Fiasco]
Over the hills and through the hoods we go
With the F to the I to the A S C O
FI-IIIIIIII-ASCO, hey
Where ya goin?
Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lupe

[Verse 4 - Lupe Fiasco]
So as long as I'm right here and as long as there's nike airs
We gon' get it on as long as light years
Or as long as light's here, right here
You will last as long as a nice pair of white airs with slight care
In other words your career as long as dyke hair
Keep it right here, y'all ball fades
I'm all braids with white hair
All man from a cold land like white bears
And I don't wanna go back to the bike chair
Then send em back when the back of that dyke's there
It's Lu, player, well let me back up like endos back of the bikes in the air
But this ain't new years, mac out the window
So when you see this player limpin
With the passenger tucked, just follow procedure
Swallow your pride, and follow the leader

[Hook - Lupe Fiasco]
Over the hills and through the hoods we go
With the F to the I to the A S C O
FI-IIIIIIII-ASCO, hey
Where ya goin?
Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lu Lupe

[Verse 1]
The smiles as she walked in the room
Have all turned into frowns
Am I too quick to assume that the love is no longer in bloom?
The tantrums and the tears play a very different tune
To what they did before, her head's red raw
And the ending doesn't sound like the happiest around
When you sobbed before
It felt much more like the product of a squabble
Now there's reason for it to be something more

[Chorus 1]
And there would be, oh, it's uncertain
Whether the curtain has shut for good
She said, "See if it's still raining, I'm not dressed for it"
And, "If you loved me–"
And I interrupted, received a scowl and stare
But still decided to stop her there

[Verse 2]
Would it be outrageous to say
We're either shouting or we're shagging?
Docked in tempestuous bays
Or at least that's how it felt yesterday
The eyes are getting heavier
And whether you're asleep or awake

[Chorus 2]
Is a mystery
Would a kiss be too much to ask?
When you fit me
As Sunday's frozen pitch fits the thermos flask
It's a pity
It just hit me, we can't go back
To the chest touching on the back

[Verse 1]
Sketchead is coming to your party
He's walking up your drive and he's swinging all his keys around
Sketchead, he's seen you with your top off
He already knows your boyfriend, retain your introductions
Sketchead, that cumbersome protagonist
The pips in your quince, the eye behind the spy hole
The itch you can't itch in your ear
And the knock that shattered your packet of peppermints

[Verse 2]
Sketchead, there's poison in his spit
He'll compliment your tits and leave you to your wits
Sketchead, convincingly insisting
The tyres were bald when you gave him the car
Sketchead, still coming to your party
Still walking up your drive and still swinging all his keys around
On his finger as a pendulum to unnerve

[Verse 3]
And then there's you, you've changed
I approached you like you were the same
But soon it was apparent a new name was required
New lips went and fired accomplishments at me
While I'm captivated by your magazine skin
The tint on your lenses obscures to begin
And you know full well
That anyone who says that they don't prefer the sequel
Will still be swinging on themselves tonight

[Intro: Tricky Stewart]
Now to sing her latest recording
It's the beautiful, Miss Rihanna

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Now this be the last time you did me wrong
No more layin' up in your arms
No calling, sayin' you want me back
I'm packin' my bags, what you think about that?

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
Stayed at home like a good girl do
But tonight, baby, you got me sad and blue
I just heard about the girl in your car, y'all kissin' at the bar
Got me cryin'

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Oh, you got me hatin' on the club
'Cause you took my love
Oh, you took my love
Now you got me like whoa
You got me hatin' on the club
'Cause you took my love
Why'd you have to take my love? Whoa
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
And you can be mad at me all you want
I ain't comin' in, I'll be waitin' out front
Comin' out the door with your girlfriend
You did me wrong, boy, tell me where our love went

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
Stayed at home like a good girl do
But tonight, baby, you got me sad and blue
I just heard about the girl in your car, y'all kissin' at the bar
Got me cryin'

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Oh, you got me hatin' on the club
'Cause you took my love
Oh, you took my love
Now you got me like whoa
You got me hatin' on the club
'Cause you took my love
Why'd you have to take my love? Whoa
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...

[Bridge: Rihanna]
Now this is the sound of a broken heart
There's only one reason why we're apart
She never woulda made it to your car
If it wasn't for the club, I'd still have my love
I'd still have my love
We would still have us
We would still have us
I'd still have my love
I'd still have my love
We would still have us
But now we're, now we're like whoa

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Ohhh, you got me hatin' on the club
'Cause you took my love
Oh, you took my love
But now, now we're like whoa
You got me hatin' on the club
You took my love
Oh, you took my love

[Outro: The-Dream]
You got her hatin', oh, you got her hatin' on the—
You got her hatin', oh, you got her hatin' on the—
You got her hatin', oh, you got her hatin' on the—
Club, club, club, club
You got her hatin', oh, you got her hatin' on the—
You got her hatin', oh, you got her hatin' on the—
You got her hatin', oh, you got her hatin' on the—

[Verse 1]
Ya hopefully hand over the Land Rover keys
Slowly and run like hosiery
I move eggs like ovaries
Closed lactose and sudairy
Who y'all suppose to be?
None of them close to me, my poetry poison til' they posing me
And little kids poking me openly
Fuck police I slip through they fingers like rosaries
Off the hook with the .38 rotaries
Get it locally move anti-socially
Twice the rapper get it from both of me jokingly
So constant and nonchalant from BIC's to Mont Blanc's
Lose conscience, Lu's not the one to confront
Worth my weight you impersonate niggas like
Miller Light spit it right in your life, terminate
I'm the worst case scenario
Bump heads for coins like Mario
Pop more rounds than Merry-Go(-rounds), from birth date to burial
In South Beach beeches going south with they mouth piece without speech
Oh now he's official from the start
They miss you, holding vigils in the dark
Go head try and stop it, couldn't block sun with Hawaiian Tropic
What's in your pockets my profits
Foxes pick me up like chop sticks, this hotness
They wanna put me in boxes like chocolates...that's nonsense
Nothin' sweet about this but the hotel room Presidential like the wrist
I know, I'm sorry I never meant to end shit
Never rental get mine freeway like Van Wyck
Peace to Francis and all my manz(iz)
Take trips to France(iz) where all my manz is
With fifths in handz(iz) rewind and chant this, niggas!

[Verse 2]
I got a bezel from embezzlin' Good Heavens! And they said I lost it in 97'
About to start using Mexicans not cause they better than just cause I get Si Senor not I need more
With chicks from Singapore from bunk beds ?
To tour room Colonials and still testimonial
And so I keep it secret, in the kitchen in the cabinet in a jar where the grease is
L-U-P speaks it til' its pieces, peanut butta like
Always being a quiet cat not the meanest motherfucker type
For a hundred grand plus, I'd be buffin' brass Knucks
Best listen to your dawgs, get Son of Sam'd up, what!
Ahead of my time, failed history passed chemistry, quiet nines in Quinine
My energy always be weaponry to unload, while there's people to holdup reputations to uphold
I'm Gung Ho with them white lines, not the kind that divides traffic
But the kind that reminds addicts, automatics to yo attic
Tecked out Porsche' in the decked out Boxter WASup!
Fed's is nice with the camera's, challengers get beat black and lavender
Women put my name across they chest like janitors
Fans of the, hustler under the stairs his fiends on the banisters WHAT!!!

[Intro]
Ah.. so much money!

Top back yeah I got my top back
Top back riding with my top back
Big ass pistol on my hip ain't gonna cock that
Top back riding with my top back

[Verse 1]
Got my top back and you know im switching lanes
Tatted on my arm Money Gang
Pull up in that black then go kill a nigga
40 for a show 100 mil a year
Shout out to my partner they watching him
300 a hour they be friends with him
He came in the club with bands on him
We turn it up took pictures with my fans on him
What's sup? Swag Daddy nigga what's up?
Kush blunts nigga what's up?
Dirty lean nigga what's up?
Top back yeah I got my top back
Lambo aventador oh my god watch that!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
They ain't gettin' money, and that's a shame
You know what I rep? Money Gang!
Stacks On Deck in the V I P
A young rich nigga all eyes on me!
Top back yeah I got my top back
Going aces of spades, gold bottles fuck the tax!
S O D Gang all up in the streets
Niggas say my name but want no beef!
Top back flexing in ferraris
White Porsches and black homies I got to go I'm sorry!
Gettin' all this money, everyday I'm stuntin'!
S O D my gang and we keep this shit 300

[Outro]
I pray to god that you never be like one of those fuck niggas
None of these pussy ass niggas
And we gon' get money everyday
And stay truth to the streets....yeahh!

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention

[Chorus]
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

[Verse 2]
No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter
You're my experimental game
Just human nature
It's not what good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey

[Chorus]
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

[Bridge]
Us girls, we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist, so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent

[Chorus]
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

[Chorus]
Im in love with Chanel
All these gold rings on my fingers you can't tell?
Im in love with Chanel
All these gold chains 'round my neck you can't tell?
Im in love with Chanel
Im in love with Chanel
Im in love with Chanel
Im in love with Chanel
Im in love with Chanel
Im in love with Chanel

[Verse 1]
Im in love with Chanel
All these gold rings on my fingers you can't tell?
I walk inside the mall and buying it by the bags
Hit my cellphone private messages going hell
Im in love with bow mane
Overseas in paris man i gotta ball mane
55 thousand dollars sitting on my tac
If it ain't a G bitch i gotta send it back
Riding through the hood in a armored car flat
Hieroglyphic jewellery and it looking like artifact
Im in love with Chanel
All my fucking jewelry shining hard you can't tell?
Sitting getting bars like you sitting in a cell
Flipping different cars like oh my god on the hill

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Shawty wanna turner she know that im popping
In the V I P Chanel what im rocking
Gucci wearbottoms in the back for a auction
22 racks when my pockets on sloppy
Pizza with the toppin' Soulja Boy quapin'
Lamborghini pedal to the metal no stoppin'
Im in love with coco
Riding through the hood and im watching for popo
Catch me in the hood with the dark black 44
Nigga talk down put his body to the flo
Shout out to MK mane thats my roro
Riding through the hood and you already know

[Chorus]
(Intro)

I’m walkin with my strap, I give a fuck a nigga searchin
Don’t keep it in the car, I got that pistol on person

One years old and he already start cursin
12 years old and he already start servin

(Hook)
If you ain’t getting money then I think you don’t deserve it
You reach for my chain you be another dead person
Big Guwap, why they call me Mr. Perfect
Then look me in my eyes when you see me cuz you’re nervous
I murk your homeboy and I smoked a pound of purple
You’re talkin to the cops, pussy nigga I know you’re worthless
Hard top Rolls, smoking kush behind the curtains
The word just came in, wutchu wanna purchase?

(Verse)
Fuck it cuz the young nigga turfin
If you ain’t getting no money then these bitches feel you’re worthless
Oh you a live-wire? Then I’mma make you short-circuit
These clown ass niggas need to go work in the circus
Million dollar nigga but I still eat Church's
You try me in these Church's then my boy then start burstin
When he died and this Boosy mama feel he didn’t deserved it
Box cutter in my pocket, I carve yo ass up like a turkey
Put that on my squad, I ain’t gon let no nigga hurt me
My gun do all my talkin and I know you niggas heard me
Old school vet like I’m fuckin James Worthy
But I’m shootin from the corner like I’m fuckin Bobby Hurley
(Hook)
If you ain’t getting money then I think you don’t deserve it
You reach for my chain you be another dead person
Big Guwap, why they call me Mr. Perfect
Then look me in my eyes when you see me cuz you’re nervous

You’re talkin to the cops, pussy nigga I know you’re worthless
Hard top Rolls, smoking kush behind the curtains
The word just came in, wutchu wanna purchase?

(Verse: Wooh Da Kid)
Money makin me, no it’s money makin Wooh Da
My youngin 13 like a 3rd world shooter
In a couple years he’ll be taking over blocks
AK47, got him takin over spots
The only thing I see in the mirror is me
Before you catch me slippin it’s gon be a first degree
Word around town you a motherfuckin hater
We fucked the same bitch, the only difference is you paid er
If you ain’t getting money you a motherfuckin joke
Reachin for my strap if a nigga going broke
Screamin adios, left from bacon from the toast
One minute here, next minute you a ghost (adios)

(Hook)
If you ain’t getting money then I think you don’t deserve it
You reach for my chain you be another dead person
Big Guwap, why they call me Mr. Perfect
Then look me in my eyes when you see me cuz you’re nervous

You’re talkin to the cops, pussy nigga I know you’re worthless
Hard top Rolls, smoking kush behind the curtains

Gucci!

[Verse 1]
Knock-knock, mothafucks, it's me, Mr. Clusterfuck
What, when, where, how, like who gives a fuck
Golf Wang M-O-B, mopping niggas ante up
Ain't been this fucking sick since brain cancer ate my Granny up
Rest in peace or lie in it, life ain't got no light in it
Darker than that closet that nigga Frankie was hiding in
Open it, dope in it, Bobby where's my fucking pipe?
Dress my little dick as Ike, twenty says I hit your wife
This is life, truthfully I just want to fly some kites
Grab Salem and Slater and go around, riding bikes
Get some ice cream, Golf Wang Roscoe's for the night
To skate around and do annoying shit that older peeps despise
Nigga fuck it though, going hard as riga mo
Got a nigga dollars and a couple cracker kids at shows
Cracked a couple kids in the head with this cast
Had a blast out in Europe, had a Swedish bitch licking toes
That's how it goes, designing clothes
Cats on everything, cats on everything
You think all this money will make a happy me?
But I'm 'bout as lonely as crackers that supermodels eat
Everybody's sparking but me, and I keep coughing
Can't keep calm in this spot's hot box and I'm getting nauseous
Hop in the car, ride to Saugus, and head straight to the office
Pissed off at Jasper because that's some faggot shit called "Pink Dolphin"
I roll here on a mean unicorn
Green hat, Vans, Golf top is the team uniform
Downing that Capri Sun, tighten my bandana up
Something like a lez, I'm forgetting my damn manners cause

[Chorus]
I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy

[Verse 2]
When you're alone thoughts start coming in
Punching in that dark lock box and they start rummaging
Shit you've got to battle with, wishing they could skedaddle
But it makes your shadow say none, fun and grab the gun again
I needed to get out of the house
So I hit the Dead Sams, and we went biking it out
In a black hoodie, with an Arizona and a bag of Skittles
Just to see what all that fucking hype is about
Now everytime you see a roach you think of me, ay?
Cause everytime I see one I think what his parents would say
In court saying I ate him, I wasn't present that day
I was with Whitney smoking, sitting at the dock of the bay

[Chorus]
I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy

[Verse 3]
Do you know how weird it is knowing I make a bunch of cheese
While my friends can't afford little pizzas from Little Caesars
And their whole goal is to roll up and smoke bowls
So I don't feel bad when they not eating
(But you still treating us, you punk bitch)
Wolf Haley got more methods than Pinkman
I'm never civil, fuck Lincoln, 'Preme out the bag it's no wrinkles
I'm okie dokie and loopy and booboo nana and caca
If you think I'm fucking koo-koo, try talking to my shrink then

[Skit: Tyler, The Creator as Dr. TC, Sam, and Wolf]
"Hey..."
"Bitch."
"I'm right here."
"Yo, who's that..?"
"That's Salem, that's my girlfriend. You stay the fuck away from her alright?"

[Chorus]
I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy
9:45 and I came back just like Jordan would
His numbers 45 if he’s Jordan sized
Still got the 45 – 45 niggas on line and everybody want a 9 (James Worthy)
George Gervin, Im finger rolling 50 blunts of purp and
I'm jumping out the gym dope Erving
I pulled up servin J’s like Bobby Hurley
Got 42 bricks James Worthy

Most of my tools whip the fours (foe’s)
Yeah the Kobes (24’s) on the jeep and Lebrons on the Rolls
Like the Jordans on the coup 21’s on the front
Make the dope do the Plastic Man Stacey Augmon dunks
Pushin on the chamber pourin like I’m shakin to break ya goals
Just broke a brick down tryna make it back wholes
It’s a sticky situation when you’re cutting dope
Duece on the four when I’m strapped let it go
I owe my whole career to the damn bowl
I need some hoes in this house but I ain’t talkin bout a whole
Dirty talkin bout dope when you swing the dance floor
And I keep money on the floor cus it bring me more flow
I'mma black me some swappy shit nigga I can go
In the bin the hood come part of me she can peel a whole
Call me Robin Hood they know I’m robbin rich out with the poles
Selling white birds and black birds 100 dozen crows
9:45 and I came back just like Jordan would
His numbers 45 if he’s Jordan sized
Still got the 45 – 45 niggas on line and everybody want a 9 (James Worthy)
George Gervin​, Im finger rolling 50 blunts of purp and
I'm jumping out the gym dope Erving
I pulled up servin J’s like Bobby Hurley
Got 42 bricks James Worthy

[Part 1 - Bow Down]

[Intro]
I'm out that H-town
Coming, coming down
I'm coming down dripping candy on the ground
H, H-town, town, I'm coming down
Coming down dripping candy on the ground

[Verse 1]
I know when you were little girls
You dreamt of being in my world
Don't forget it, don’t forget it
Respect that, bow down bitches
I took some time to live my life
But don't think I'm just his little wife
Don't get it twisted, get it twisted

Smack that trick, smack that trick

Gold everything, gold ass chain
Gold ass rings, gold ass fangs
You can see me stunt when you turn on ya screen
You can see me stunt when you turn on ya screen

[Hook]

Tell me who gon' take me off
Take me off, take me off, take me off

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
A bitch is a female dog, and they say a dog is a man's best friend
HOLLA!
Haha!

[Verse 1]
You'll be happier when I'm gone
Much too busy to worry
I'll be sad, and you'll feel bad
But I know you won't be sorry
And as I turn to go
Please don't wave goodbye
I refuse to cry
On roads that are paved
With men who behave
Like they know where they're goin'

[Verse 2]
And I'll stop along the way
And it's then I'll think of you
And I'll wonder if you knew
When I got blue
And things got weird
And I started growing
Bob Dylan's beard

[Verse 1]
You torched a Saab like a pile of leaves
I'd gone to find some better wheels
Four, five meters runnin' 'round the bend
When the government agents surround you again

[Chorus]
If Diane Young won't change your mind
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time

[Verse 2]
Out of control but you're playing a role
Do you think you can go til the 18th hole
Or will you flip-flop the day of the championship?
Try to go a little long on your own for a bit

[Chorus]
If Diane Young won't change your mind
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time

[Bridge]
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on
Baby, baby, baby, it’s a light on
Baby, baby, baby, it’s a lifetime
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on
Time, time, time, time, t-time, time
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time
Ooh, you let 'em go
Di-Di, Di-Di-Di-Di

[Chorus]
If Diane Young won't change your mind
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time

[Verse 3]
Irish and proud, baby, naturally
But you got the luck of a Kennedy
So grab the wheel, keep on holdin' it tight
'Til you're tottering off into that goodnight

[Chorus]
If Diane Young won't change your mind
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time

[Bridge]
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on
Baby, baby, baby, it’s a light on
Baby, baby, baby, it’s a lifetime
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on
Time, time, time, time, t-time, time
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time

[Verse 4]
Nobody knows what the future holds
And it’s bad enough just getting old
Live my life in self-defense
You know I love the past, ’cause I hate suspense

[Chorus]
If Diane Young won't change your mind
Baby, baby, baby, baby, right on time
To my fans

I want to thank you for listening and being patient for as long as you have. No matter what an artist's ego clouds them to believe, you are the reason why I have been able to continue to do what I love to do and that is to entertain you. My journey for inspiration may seem like masochism to others who have not been given the task to make art, but best believe it brings me nothing but joy.

Because I am a man of few words, I chose to make a viral video to show you how I felt and where I stand. I usually don't like to "spoon feed" my audience because I grew up idolizing story tellers who tell stories using symbolism, so it was in my nature to do the same. The Rolling Stone video takes place in a dimly lit studio which represents the two worlds I have been stuck in. The gloomy side represents the mainstream world while the other side represents the underground. The girl holding on represents you. As the world slowly gets familiar with my face the more you will lose interest (hence the pieces of her clothes coming off at every shot). The camera lights symbolize the crossover, and when they begin to flash I look away from the underground. Even though I don't want to, it is a step that I feel I must take to evolve as an artist.

This predicament is impossible to relate to unless you are put in that unique situation. I want you to know and understand that this does not mean what you think it means, and I made sure of that in my deal. You will continue to get what you fell in love with, and I will continue to give you what you ask for. I'll never make you wait again. With that being said expect more from me very soon leading up to Trilogy. Thank you again for your patience and loyalty, I will not disappoint.

Sincerely
Abel Tesfaye XO

[Intro]
Every time I see you in the world, you always step to my girl

[Verse 1]
Back, back, way back I used to front like Angkor Wat
Mechanicsburg, Anchorage and Dar es Salaam
While home in New York was champagne and disco
Tapes from L.A. slash San Francisco
But actually Oakland and not Alameda
Your girl was in Berkeley with her Communist reader
Mine was entombed within boombox and Walkman
I was a hoarder, but girl, that was back then

[Chorus]
The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out
What you on about?
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house
Such a modest mouse
I can't do it alone
I can't do it alone

[Refrain]
Every time I see you in the world
You always step to my girl

[Verse 2]
Ancestors told me that their girl was better
She's richer than Croesus, she's tougher than leather
I just ignore all the tales of her past life
Stale conversation deserves but a bread knife
And punks who would laugh when they saw us together
Well, they didn't know how to dress for the weather
I can still see them there, huddled on Astor
Snow falling slow to the sound of the master

[Chorus]
The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out
What you on about?
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house
Such a modest mouse
I can't do it alone
I can't do it alone

[Bridge]
Wisdom's a gift, but you'd trade it for youth
Age is an honor, it's still not the truth
We saw the stars when they hid from the world
You cursed the sun when it stepped to your girl
Maybe she's gone and I can't resurrect her
The truth is she doesn't need me to protect her
We know the true death, the true way of all flesh
Everyone's dying, but girl, you're not old yet

[Chorus]
Gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out
What you on about?
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house
Such a modest mouse
I can't do it alone
I can't do it alone
Gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out
What you on about?
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house
Such a modest mouse
I can't do it alone
I can't do it alone

[Outro]
Every time I see you in the world
You always step to my girl

Rich forever
Straight cake

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
No top on the Ferrari, cherry on top
Dopeboy diamonds, matching Reeboks
Painting on the wall cost me 2.8
Basquiat boy, what you know about cake, boy
Two week tour, bonjour, then I skate
3.5 after-party's getting raped
02 arena, nigga London felt great
Twenty thousand in attendence while I'm smoking on the sage
Had a house party, white girl's sniffin' paint
Now she on the molly, I'm just countin' all the bank
Still smokin' dank, Lenny Kravitz's estate
Rock my own sneakers boy, cake, cake, cake

[Verse 2: Rihanna]

Doggy want the kitty (yeah)
Give me a heart attack and throw it back, now watch me get it
And you knew this, but you the shit, damn girl, you pretty
Blowing out your candles, let me make a couple wishes, ah

[Verse 5: Rihanna]
Remember how you did it?
Remember how you ht it?
If you still wanna kiss it
Come, come, come and get it
Sweeter than a rice cake
Cake worth sipping
Kill it, tip it, cake, fill it
If you sexy and you know it
And you ain't afraid to show it
Put a candle on my ma'fuckin' back
Baby, blow it
Love the way you do when you do it like that
Show up with the stacks
Raining racks on my rack
Wrap it up, wrap it up
Boy, while I take this bow off
Talk that talk
Yeah, I know I'm such a show off
Daddy, make a wish
Put this cake in your face
Hahaha, and it's not even my birthday
Ow!

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Get it, ooh, it's not even her birthday (her birthday, uh)
But I wanna lick the icing off (the icing off, damn)
Give it to her in the worst way (the worst way, uh)
Can't wait to blow her candles out

[Verse]
Jezebel, wasn't born
With a silver spoon in her mouth
She prob'ly had
Less than every one of us
But when she knew how to walk, she knew
How to bring the house down
Can't blame her for her beauty
She wins with her hands down

[Verse]
Jezebel, what a belle
Looks like a princess in her new dress
"How did you get that?"
"Do you really want to know?" she said
It would seem she's on her way
It's more, more than just a dream
She put on her stockings and shoes
Had nothing to lose
She said it was worth it

[Chorus]
Reach for the top
And the sun is gonna shine
Every winter was a war, she said
I want to get what's mine

[Verse]
Jezebel, Jezebel
Won't try to deny where she came from
You can see it in her pride
And the raven in her eyes
Try show her a better way
She'll say, "You don't know
What you've been missing"
And by the time she blinks, you know
She won't be list'ning

[Chorus]
Reach for the top, she said
And the sun is gonna shine
Every winter was a war, she said
I want to get what's mine

[Verse 1]
This may come, this may come as some surprise
But I miss you
I could see through all of your lies
But still I miss you
He takes her love, but it doesn't feel like mine
He tastes her kiss, her kisses are not mine, they're not mine
He takes, but surely she can't give what I'm feeling now
She takes, but surely she doesn't know how

[Chorus]
Is it a crime?
Is it a crime?
That I still want you
And I want you to want me, too

[Verse 2]
My love is wider, wider than Victoria Lake
My love is taller, taller than the Empire State
It dives, it jumps and it ripples like the deepest ocean
I can't give you more than that, surely you want me back

[Chorus]
Is it a crime?
Is it a crime?
I still want you
And I want you to want me, too

[Verse 3]
My love is wider than Victoria Lake
Taller than the Empire State
It dives, it jumps
I can't give you more than that, surely you want me back

[Chorus]
Is it a crime?
Is it a crime?
That I still want you
And I want you to want me, too

[Bridge]
It dives, it jumps and it ripples like the deepest ocean
I can't give you more than that; surely you want it back

[Outro]
Tell me, is it a crime?

[Intro]
Never as good
No, baby

[Verse 1]
Good times they come and they go
Never going to know
What fate is going to blow
Your way just hope that it feels right
Sometimes it comes and it goes
You take it ever so slow
And then you lose it
Then it flows right to you
So we rely on the past
Special moments that last
Were they as tender
As we dare to remember
Such a fine time as this
What could equal the bliss
The thrill of the first kiss
It'll blow right to you

[Chorus]
It's never as good as the first time
It's never as good as the first time
(Never as good as the first time)

[Verse 2]
Good times they come and they go
Never going to know
It's like the weather
One day chicken, next day feathers
The rose we remember
The thorns we forget
We'd love and leave
We never spend a minute on regret
It is a possibility, the more we know the less we see
Second time, is not quite what it seems
Natural as the way we came to be
The second time, won't live up to the dream

[Chorus]
It's never as good as the first time (Never as good)
It's never as good as the first time
(Never as good as the first time)

[Bridge]
Natural as the way we came to be
Second time won't live up to the dream
It's natural as the way we came to be
The second time is not quite what it seems

[Chorus]
It's never, ooh, as good as the first time
As the first time
Never as good as the first time

[Bridge]
Natural as the way we came to be
Second time won't live up to the dream
Natural as the way we came to be
Second time is not quite what it seems

[Chorus]
It's never as good as the first time
As the first time
As good as the first time

[Verse]
I'd wash the sand off the shore
Give you the world if it was mine
Blow you right to my door
Feels fine

[Chorus]
Feels like
You're mine
Feels right
So fine
I'm yours
You're mine
Like paradise
I'd give you the world if it was mine
Feels fine
Feels like
You're mine
I'm yours
So fine
Like paradise

[Verse]
I'd wash the sand off the shore
Give you the world if it was mine
Blow you right to my door
Feels fine

[Chorus]
Feels like
You're mine
Feels right
So fine
I'm yours
You're mine
Like paradise

[Outro]
Ooh, what a life
Ooh, what a life
Ooh, what a life
Ooh, what a life
I wanna share my life
Wanna share my life with you
Wanna share my life
I wanna share my life
Wanna share my life with you
Wanna share my life
I wanna share my life
Wanna share my life with you
(Ooh, what a life)
Wanna share my life
Wanna share my life with you

Wanna share my life
Wanna share my life with you
Wanna share my life
Wanna share my life with you

[Produced by Dave Tozer, Hit Boy & Kanye West]

[Verse 1]
Last night was the last night
You'll ever spend alone
Couldn’t wait, did it in the living room
Soon as I saw you, baby, I had plans
Plans to do it 'til we have a baby
Even if the world is crazy
Pick some names, boy or girl
Then we’ll change, change the world

[Hook]
So after you change your clothes
Girl, if you change your mind
I’m ready, whatever time
It’s the beginning of forever
You don’t have to call
Sometimes you just know
It’s the beginning of forever
You don’t have to end
Keep doing it, and doing it again, oh
Keep doing it, and doing it again, oh

[Verse 2]
Last time was the last time, I was worn and done
You the best, that's why I want another one
Soon as I saw you, baby I had plans
Plans to take you to my elevator
And cook a little breakfast later
Pick a place and go there, girl
Then we’ll change, change the world

[Hook]

[Hook]
So after you change your clothes
Girl, if you change your mind
I’m ready, whatever time
It’s the beginning of forever
You don’t have to call
Sometimes you just know
It’s the beginning of forever
You don’t have to end
Keep doing it, and doing it again, oh
Keep doing it, and doing it again, oh

[Intro: Diddy]
I'll do anything for you... for you I'll change the world
No more wars, no more poverty, no more hurt, no more pain
You showed me how to love you again, for you I change the world
Pain sing...

[Hook: T-Pain]
If I could change the world
Oh, I would be the sunlight in your universe
Oh, you will think my love was really something good, baby
If I could change, if I could change
If I could change the world, the world, the world, the world

[Verse I: T-Pain]
Ooh there would be no more wars
Opportunity knockin' on doors for us, for us
Nobody ain't known each other
Buddies turning into lovers for us, for us
Oh when the moonlight turns to sunshine
Everybody waking up to abandon dreams (Uh-uh uh-uh)
Cause everybody need what they want
But don't want what they need; let's talk about unity
Changing the world!

[Hook: T-Pain]
If I could change the world (hey yeah)
Oh, I would be the sunlight in your universe (in your universe)
Oh, you will think my love was really something good, baby
If I could change (change), if I could change (yeah, change)
If I could change the world, the world, the world, the world

[Verse II: Akon]
If I could change the world
I order for the line to be erased that the border this day
This day, everyone deserves an opportunity
There be no new world order
If nobody wouldn't never got slaughtered that way
That way, that means so much more love and unity
Daughters will be close to their mothers
Sons will be raised by their fathers today
Today, a good family ain't nothing greater
Races crimes, hate crimes will never exist, I'll turn everyone into a Hershey's kiss (kiss)
And we can eat away our fear (fear), ooooh

[Hook: T-Pain, Akon & Marry J. Blige]
If I could change the world (oooh)
Oh, I would be the sunlight in your universe (hey)
Oh, you will think my love was really something good, baby
If I could change (yeah), if I could change (if I could, if I could, I would change)
If I could change the world (the world), the world (the world), the world, the world

[Verse III: Mary J. Blige]
There would be no self hate
We will all have to love everything about ourselves, so we can love everyone else
Nothing would hold us down
Because we'll all walk around with a smile and never frown and that will remove those clouds
There'll be no more self-loathing
Everyone will know in their hearts that they just fine and that's when the light's gonna shine
Everyone will understand
In order to have some peace you must believe, believe the best in you
Believe I can change

[Hook: T-Pain & Mary J. Blige & both]
If I could change the world
Oh, I would be the sunlight in your universe (sunlight in your universe)
Oh, you will think my love was really something good, baby
If I could change (Change the world), if I could change the world
If I could, if I could change the world, the world, the world, the world

[Verse]
Would you mind if I speak to my lady for a minute?
Woah I been yearning to hold your body close to mine tonight
Is that alright? I been missing you and your love
Your smile, your touch, girl
Look into your eyes and see the sun rise
So beautiful to me
You know what I'd like to see
Won't you put it on for me, put it on?
Won't you put it on for me, put it on?
Baby put it on, put it on
Baby put it on, put it on
Ooh, put it on on me
Please get your lips
Ready for me
For me, for me, for me

Walk about that bitch I need a million dollars cash
I’m tryin’ to break the bank (4x)

[Verse 1]
I’m tryn’ to break the bank fuck you niggas think
Pull up in that Bentley customize the paint
Lean in the sink I’m doing what you can’t
Nigga say they getting money but I know they ain’t
Throw up in the sink, pouring up my drink
Came out the water put that 9 in your face
50 thousand dollars made my lawyer beat the case
It ain’t really nothing shoot that nigga in his face
Bitches love the taste, niggas say your Grace
Grind through the hood Gucci on my shoelace

That was like 5 years, 2012 I’m outta here

I look in the hater face and ask what do we have here?
It’s Soulja, it’s Soulja

I’m pulling up in Ferarris , I’m yelling diamond shorty
I’m sipping lean and Bacardi remember I’m the shooter of the party
I really don’t go retarded, get me started I go hardest

[Hook]
I’m tryin’ to break the bank (8x)
Walk inside that bitch 500k cash
Walk about that bitch I need a million dollars cash
I’m tryin’ to break the bank (4x)

Hold up nigga I go in, these niggas ain’t got no win
Baddest bitches I be with they lookin like they modelin'

Before them shots hit your body make you fall e nigga
Like it’s september, thanking my daddy I’m the next Simba
Meek Milly, bitch

[Verse 2: Lee Mazin]
I ain’t lookin' at you bitches, cause I feel none of you bitches
I ain’t checkin' for you niggas, I ain’t worried 'bout you niggas
And my shit be kinda major, like I’m balling for the figures
Got 2 chains around my neck, you could see I do it different
She so bad but she go so ho, shit got real when I got that ball
Too 3d, but you can’t see me
And you can’t stick Lee cause I want it hard
The shit goes swish, and you know I did it for the win
And yeah I killed this check but fuck that shit I’ma do it again
Do it again just to quench they thirst
If you dive in put your face in first
I make 'em lick it, and yeah my girls ball hard like Steve Boss
I make 'em click it
And when I spit that shit they like I turn that pure 

[?]
And then they see that body, see that ass, that shit ridiculous
Man like fuck lee, I scream right back like fuck you too
If you want the beef first you gotta get through my fucking crew
That’s to y’all lame nasty see
Name one chick who could fuck with me
Hold up, oh wait I say, name on chick who fucking with me
If you talking shit, just be careful what come out your mouth
Aroma something erotic, make your boyfriend pay to smell it out
Or taste it, he put his face in
He like we fuck your government that shit amazing

[Verse 3: Louie V]
Yeah I’m talking me, yeah I’m talking meek
Yeah I’m talking Lee, Lil' Chino and Lil' Snup-e
Murder on every track, preferred Jahlil B
I’m talking bout Rozay too, we reppin with MMG
Cruising through south beach, in a California ferarri
Shine brighter than california, my jewelry it’s extra gaudy
Peep the way I maneuver, she says I’m smooth as a barbie
So she gave me her number, I fucked her after the party
Man I’m living life, I might do that tonight
Met them bottles of rose, the waitress put 'em on ice
Sparkles all in my section man I could give you a light
Man my niggas be stuntin like Chino were born to bike
Yes lord, the dreamchasers
We blowin money fast like we never seen paper
Now I got these new relatives, and everybody callin'
All of a sudden this shit started James Harden
I tell em talk about some money but they ain't talking
But I’ma go and get it 'till they put me in the coffin
It’s funny now that they callin me the shit
Louie V, DC, shit man, and ain’t nobody fuckin with my clique

[Verse 1]
Well, Annie's pretty neat
She always eats her meat
Joey's almost strong
Bet your life he's putting us on
Oh lordy, oh lordy
You know I need some loving
Move me, touch me

[Chorus]
John, I'm only dancing
She turns me on
But I'm only dancing
She turns me on
Don't get me wrong
I'm only dancing

[Verse 2]
Ah, Shadow love was quick and keen
Life's a well thumbed machine
Saw you watching from the stairs
You're everyone that ever cared
Oh lordy, oh lordy
You know I need some loving
Move me, touch me

[Chorus]
John, I'm only dancing
She turns me on
But I'm only dancing

Don't get me wrong

[Outro]
Dancing
Won't someone dance with me?
Touch me

[Verse 1]
I see them gathered, see them on the shore
I turned to look once more
And he who knows me not
Takes me to the belly of darkness

[Bridge]
The tears run swift and hard
And when they fall
Even, even the comfort of a stone
Would be a gain
There was a time when I thought
I would have to give up
But I´m thankful that I´m
Strong as I am and I´ll
Try to do the best I can

[Pre-Chorus]
Tears will run swift
And tears will come that fall like rain
I pray that it´s swift though
Tears will fall as cold as pain

[Chorus]
I pray to the almighty
Let me not to him do
As he has unto me
Teach my beloved children
Who have been enslaved
To reach for the light continually

[Verse 2]
So many times I prayed
So many times I´ve prayed for you
Prayed for you

[Bridge]
The tears run swift and
Hard and cold as pain
Even, even the comfort of a stone would be a gain
Had I not had the strength and wisdom of a warrior
I would have to give up
But I´m thankful that I´m
Strong as I am and I´ll
Try to do the best I can

[Pre Chorus]
Tears will run swift
And tears will come that fall like rain
I pray that it´s swift though
Tears will fall as cold as pain

[Chorus]
I pray to the almighty
Let us not do as he has unto us
Teach my beloved children I´ve been a slave
But reach for the light continually

[Outro]
Wisdom is the flame
Wisdom is the brave warrior
Who will carry us into the sun
I pray that it´s swift though
Tears will come that fall like rain
So many times, so many times

[Intro]
Uh
Uh, uh

[Verse 1]
Close my eyes before I cross the street
If a car about to hit me, then he ought to beep (Uh-huh)
Watchin' Dawson's Creek 'til I fall asleep
It's harder than it seems, I'm underwater in my dreams
I'm in awe, this jigsaw puzzle's not complete
I'm just an idea, nothin' con-cer-ete (Whoa)
I came to raise limits, get higher than plane engines
They tryna change wit' us, but come to the same difference (Okay)
Shut your pie-hole, I'm dope and I know
My voice sound like it was a sample off a vinyl
I don't mind those hatin' on my style
I tend to take the high road, get stoned and fly low
I'm no God
I don't think that I'm a human though, 'cause I'm so odd
People sellin' drugs 'cause they can't find no job
Wonder if Christ made a million off of sellin' the cross
Let bygones be bygones, my mind strong as pythons
The day that I die on will turn me to an icon
Search the world for Zion or a shoulder I can cry on
The best of all time, I'm Dylan, Dylan, Dylan
Dylan, (Dylan)

[Chorus]
Somebody do somethin'
(Somebody do somethin') Somebody do somethin'
(Somebody do somethin') Somebody do somethin'
(Somebody do somethin') Somebody do somethin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, somebody move somethin'
Yeah, yeah, somebody move somethin'
Yeah, yeah, somebody move somethin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, somebody move somethin'

[Post-Chorus]
Ah—ah, ah—ah—ah
(Whoa) Yeah
It ain't no party like aristocratic parties
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yah, yah, yah
Ah-huh, ah-huh
Said, it ain't no party like aristocratic parties
Yeah, yo

[Verse 2]
Sippin' Jameson like I was majored in whiskey flavorin'
When I'm drunk, I'll cut your head off and leave it danglin' (Whoa)
FlyLo's still tryna put me onto Ableton
Asian women love me, I look like David Duchovny
In kindergarten, used to put some condoms in my cubby
In case one of these hoes was tryna fuck me
I ain't nobody, and neither are you (Nope)
Been contemplatin' if I even still believe in the truth, I'm so stubborn
I'd rather write my own history book
Where the world don't give a fuck 'bout how you physically look
All your songs are 16's and a hook
We here to reinvent music, it's time for the revolution
I'm dyin' for the movement, tryin' not to lose it
Jewish Buddhist consumin' the views of Christianity
Wonder if Hindus like to eat fish soup
If it's true, they should hit Alaska in a igloo
I hear the fish bitin' nice right now
I can't figure out life and feel right right now
Boo, if I think it, I should say it, there's a reason that I write it down
Spit the shit that leave a diaper brown (Poo)

[Outro]
Uh, yeah (Somebody do somethin',) somebody do somethin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Somebody do somethin')
(Somebody do somethin') Uh, somebody do somethin'
(Somebody do somethin') Yeah, yeah, yeah, somebody do somethin'
And... somebody move somethin'

Yeah, yeah (Yo, yo, yo)

Go from Malibu to Paris, boo (Yeah)

So, hit me up when you pass through
I'll give you something big enough to tear your ass in two
Swag on 'em even when you dress casual
I mean, it's almost unbearable (Everybody get up)
In a hundred years not dare would I
Pull a Pharcyde, let you pass me by
Nothin' like your last guy, he too square for you
He don't smack that ass and pull your hair like that
So I'm just watchin' and waitin'
For you to salute the true big pimpin' (Okay)
Not many women can refuse this pimpin'
I'm a nice guy, but don't get it confused, get pimpin' (Everybody get up)

*lighter flick*
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse]
I'm in the crib butt-naked, bitch
She say my dick could be the next Black president
Americans hate that I'm American
Medicine, I treat it like peppermints
Ugh, I'm in the ocean getting shark pussy
Shoot you in your fucking mouth and make you talk to me
Yeah, sometimes, I need someone to talk to
'Cause I am not a human being—part two!
Getting paid show money for walkthroughs
Letting all these hoes ride my dick: carpool
My bars passed the bar exam, no law school
Cash Money Army, veteran with my war wounds
Ugh, what your man doing?
I pop his motherfucking top like a canned good
And all my niggas that I roll with are hella armed
And last night, I took a transformer
And had a dream that my dick turned to Megatron
But my girl was sleeping with Decepticons
Money talks, man, and mine talk lecture-long
P-U-S-S-Y: my second home
I be grinding on them hoes like a half-pipe
She say, "Tunechi, you the shit; you need your ass wiped"
I say, "Before you gas me up, check the gas price"
Then I make her take this dick like advice, hahaha
She seesaw it, she suck it and enjoy it
I stick it in her ass like some fucking steroids
Jose Canseco, make no mistake
Like a white boy wearing black paint, you're a fake-ass nigga
Brake pads, nigga, wait
You ain't in my weight class, nigga
Looking for the motherfucking man in the mirror
Running this shit like a faucet: Farrah
Barra-cuda, who the fuck you are?
I can make your bitch root for me like I grew her
Bodies in the sewer, tampons in manure
Ninety billion bitches on my stick like a skewer, that's swag
I'm a true Blood, bitch, no fangs
Been went pro, now I'm going pro-pane
Tell a bitch, "Get off me!" Bitch, get off me!
I got her over here blowing me like coffee
Decaffeinated, hand me that paper like I graduated
And I get head while it's decapitated, haha
Think it's a game? Nigga, come play
I'm with my killer Bs, fuck bug spray
Yeah, Young Money so gangsta
I personally know strangers, it's so strange
But this girl named Dana like to go anal
Shoot him in his head—what's that? A no-brainer
Plain ol' nigga, but a break from the norm
I wear my heart on my sleeve, so don't be breaking my arm
I'd rather wring your fucking neck before I ring the alarm
I dream to meet a serial killer that'll bring me along with him
I gotta hit 'em like redbones with long hair
Fuck with me, your ass is grass—get a lawn chair
I was fucking before my dick started growing hair
Bitches sweating me like John Mayer or warm air
Man... Nuts and bananas
You know how the tables turn, where are your table manners?
If you fake, put a egg in your shoe and scramble
No rubber, I just fucked this piano, nigga!

[Outro: Lil Wayne / Piano Outro]
Lew!
Do you!
Whoa!
Turn it up!
Mm!
Yeah!
Hello World!
As I always say...
I...
Am not...
A human being

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
(Yeah ho!) I'm strapped up, nigga, fuck a gun law
(Yeah ho!) See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk
(Yeah ho!) I don't do no arguin', I let the gun talk
(Yeah ho!) Yeah, I'm strapped up, nigga, fuck a gun law

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, fuck that nigga, ho-ass nigga
Leave that nigga with a toe tag, nigga
Barrel so long you can pole dance, nigga
Run up in ya house, where the dope at, nigga?
Murder she wrote on a notepad, nigga
Light that nigga up, smoke that nigga
Stomp that nigga, roast that nigga
I walk around with this shotgun
And this bitch bigger than me, nigga
Don't open up your fuckin' mouth
'Cause I'll pull the trigger like teeth, nigga
Shoot 'em up then leave, nigga, I smell Summer's Eve, nigga
We shoot first, it's better to give than receive, nigga

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I'm strapped up, nigga, fuck a gun law
See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk

I don't do no arguin', I let the gun talk
And there's no talkin' back, when my gun talk

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Keep that ho shit over there (Yeah ho!)
And we don't shoot in the air
I can't fuck with these niggas, man, these niggas gummy bears
Hair trigger on the gun, I pull that motherfucker's hair
It's like, man, you can't trust nobody
I don't even have a trust fund
Don't buck, nigga, don't stunt, nigga
Don't duck, nigga, 'cause I duck hunt
Bitch, rock with me, that Glock with me
That chopper with me, obviously
I'mma empty this motherfucker
That's fifty shots, approximately
Now fuck with me, get fucked over
Emergency room, rushed over
Hollow tips in the clip
My gun loaded, yours sober
I pull your card like a lawn mower
Fall back or I'm goin' forward
I see you got your gun drawn
I'll send you back to the drawin' board
Lil Tunechi

[Post-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk
That's my gun walk, nigga, that's my gun walk
See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk
You don't talk back, when I cock back
That's my gun walk, nigga, that's my gun walk
Yeah!

[Verse 3: Gudda Gudda]
Walking 'round this motherfucker limpin'
'Cause the nose on the pistol 'bout as long as Scottie Pippen's
On the molly and I'm twisted, throw your body with the fishes
Double back around that corner and embodyin' the witness
Uh, real niggas don't talk much, do drive-by's and walk-up's
Lame rappers that talk tough get a broke jaw, star-struck
I don't fuck with lame niggas, I got good aim, nigga
Pop a pill, pop you, my nickname is Pain Killer
I'm still that same nigga; Eastside, I rep that
Pussy niggas better get right, or where I see you, you get left at
Use the rifle as my crutch, that's my gun walk
Or we can hold a conversation, let the guns talk
Gudda

[Bridge: Juicy J & Lil Wayne]
I'm strapped up, nigga, fuck a gun law
See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk
I don't do no arguin', I let the gun talk
And it's no talkin' back when it go off
You speechless, you speechless
I'm strapped up, nigga, fuck a gun law
You speechless, you speechless
See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk
You speechless, you speechless
I don't do no arguin', I let the gun talk
You speechless, you speechless - when I cock back

[Post-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk
That's my gun walk, nigga, that's my gun walk
See me walking with a limp, that's my gun walk
That's my gun walk, nigga, that's my gun walk

[Intro: Juicy J]
We trippy mayne (Mayne, mayne, mayne, mayne, mayne)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, blue skies, blue skies, I see you with my red eyes
Bust your fucking grape, nigga, turn your shit to red wine
Don't fuck up my high, nigga, I'm too gone, bye nigga
She get dick, weed, and ignored: that's a D.W.I., nigga
My skin crawlin', my walls talkin', the pictures in here lookin' at me
The ground movin', I'm seein' shit, I'm blowin' like I'm stuck in traffic
I'm smoking on that strong, got me coughin' like I'm getting buried
I've been fuckin' Mary Jane, I knew her when she was just Virgin Mary
I'm stoned, Mick Jagger, I can run around Saturn
Eyes rolling back, and keep blinking like hazards
I said, "King me", king me with my mushroom crown on
I graduated to better drugs, my cap and gown on
Don't knock me off my high horse, what I do is my choice
I'm high as the scoreboard, bitch, look up at my points
I'm trippin' out, cotton mouth, I got high and fell asleep loaded
I woke up and got high again, okay, I'm reloaded, uh

[Chorus: Juicy J]
Weed, pills and that drank, that's my trippy kit, kit
That's my trippy kit, kit, that's my trippy kit, kit
Weed, pills and that drank, that's my trippy kit, kit
That's my trippy kit, kit, that's my trippy kit, kit
Weed, pills and that drank, that's my trippy kit, kit
That's my trippy kit, kit, that's my trippy kit, kit
Weed, pills and that drank, that's my trippy kit, kit

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
We trippin', uh
Shoutout to my weed man, shoutout to my lean man
Pussy ass nigga wanna spark something, I'm a gasoline can
I'm high nigga, don't blow it, I trust it far as I could throw it
I don't know if I'm coming or going, T, make my blunt a Samoan
And I see lights flashin', life passin', take a bitch home, fuck like rabbits
Styrofoam cups and wine glasses, shot glasses, hot flashes
My tongue numb, I can't talk, no balance, my spine hurts
My mind surf, my eye jerks, I try different drugs, I'm diverse
Goodbye Earth, farewell, high as Heaven, eyes low as Hell
Keep scratching, keep biting my nails
Keep lighting a L, I'm a kite in the air
I like weed brownies and cookies, I'm straight but seeing crooked
I got my trippy kit, I hope I trip and fall in some pussy
Tunechi

[Chorus: Juicy J]
Weed, pills and that drank, that's my trippy kit, kit
That's my trippy kit, kit, that's my trippy kit, kit
Weed, pills and that drank, that's my trippy kit, kit
That's my trippy kit, kit, that's my trippy kit, kit
Weed, pills and that drank, that's my trippy kit, kit
That's my trippy kit, kit, that's my trippy kit, kit
Weed, pills and that drank, that's my trippy kit, kit
That's my trippy kit, kit...

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Musty herb in a Ziploc, twistin' up top notch
Weed that I smoke, straight off a boat
Six foot bong, tryna see what I toke
This that Cali Kush, I motivate not gloat
All I need is Mary, let the models do the coke
Tryna get some Becky in the backseat of the Ghost
Hit the weed man, tell him that I need a bag
Wake up every morning and I take a drag
Take the blunt, dip it in the lean, then I laugh
In your baby mama ear, and I'm gonna smash
They call me the trippy king, don't try me nigga
Juicy J with the Taylors, Chinese eyes, nigga

[Chorus: Juicy J]
Weed, pills and that drank, that's my trippy kit, kit
That's my trippy kit, kit, that's my trippy kit, kit
Weed, pills and that drank, that's my trippy kit, kit
That's my trippy kit, kit, that's my trippy kit, kit
Weed, pills and that drank, that's my trippy kit, kit
That's my trippy kit, kit, that's my trippy kit, kit
Weed, pills and that drank, that's my trippy kit, kit
That's my trippy kit, kit, that's my trippy kit, kit

[Outro]
Man, fuck this hating bitch ass niggas

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
She's askin' "do you have the time
To listen to me whine?"
She's askin', "who's on the other line?"
You diss me everytime
I tell her, baby I'm a star, shit, I'm above the stars
And now, I done got so high, I done forgotten who you are

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
I tell her
I'm in love with you
But I can't be with you
Tomorrow I'll be back up on the first flight
Right up out of town

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Hop back in my spaceship
Girl, I gotta drop your ass off
Cause I just come to take it
Then you know I gotta take off
But I'mma be here next week
So call your company and take off
Cause she say "Wayne you ain't shit
You got me all impatient"
Cry me a river
I can hear my conscience while I sail off

[Hook: Dre]
Boy you got a problem
And you ain't foolin' no one but yourself
You're like a hot revolver
But you ain't killin' no one but yourself
And soon she's gonna find someone to love
And you gon find yourself, so all alone

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
One minute she love me, the next minute she hate me
That's two minutes of my time she done wasted
She say she pray she have Weezy F's baby
And I be having seizures, but she say she can't shake me
And my homies say she's cuter than my other bitches
And every time I'm in that pussy it feel custom-fitted
I swear I like her more than she think I do
Girl, when I think of you
My dick just start to jumpin' like a fucking kangaroo
I suck and fuck and finger you
But you want me to cling to you
And I ain't asking you to change
Cause I know I can't jingle you
I got my ways...
And you have your days...
And we gave it our best shot
But I just got grazed
I'm sorry

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I... I can't promise you that I won't let you down
And I... I can't promise you that I will be the only one around
When your hope falls down
But we're young
Open flowers in the windy fields of this war-torn world
And love, this city breathes the plague of loving things more than
Their Creators

[Verse 2]
I ran away, I could not take the burden of both me and you
It was too fast, casting love on me as if it were a spell I could not break
When it was a promise I could not make
But if I was wrong? What if I was wrong?
Oh what if I was wrong?

[Chorus]
But hold on to what you believe
In the light, when the darkness has robbed you of all your sight
And oh hold on to what you believe
In the light, when the darkness has robbed you of all your sight

[Verse 3]
Now this land means less and less to me without you breathing through its trees
At every turn, the water runs away from me
The halo disappears, I'm not whole when you're not here
So what if I was wrong? What if I was wrong?
Oh what if I was wrong?

[Chorus]
But hold on to what you believe
In the light, when the darkness has robbed you of all your sight
And oh hold on to what you believe
In the light, when the darkness has robbed you of all your sight

[Outro]
Hold on to what you believed
In the light
She sits him down in a stiff chair
Rubs his back and strokes his hair
Telling him it's okay to cry but he just sits and stares
The merciless moon outside, has nothing now he's come to realize
Only the desolation he feels, the cold distance inside

[Chorus]
But you and I now, we can be alright
Just hold on to what we know is true
You and I now, though it's cold inside
Can feel the tide turning

While the priest just sits and weeps
Lamenting the fact that he can see
Darkness and light in so much detail he has given himself over
Refusing what he knows to be real
Turns away from every meal
Starving himself of goodness
He don't think he can heal

[Chorus]
But you and I now, we can be alright
Just hold on to what we know is true
You and I now, though it's cold inside
Can feel the tide turning
"What if I've lost all I had?"
Says the stranger to his dad
And the witness is confused
He can't tell what is bad
Instead he runs up to the nearest girl
And he comments on her glorious curls
Says, "darling, come with me"
I'll show you a whole new world

[Chorus]
But you and I now, we can be alright
Just hold on to what we know is true
You and I now, though it's cold inside
Can feel the tide turning
But you and I now, we can be alright
Just hold on to what we know is true
You and I now, though it's cold inside
Can feel the tide turning

[Intro: Earl Sweatshirt]
"Oh... me? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm just tryna say somethin' before... I... I... drop it off."

[Verse 1: Vince Staples]
I feel like the Tom Sawyer for real niggas
Looking for a problem, revolver under the Hilfiger
No bluff needed, we will kill niggas
So try me if you want, bruh, I promise I'm with all of that
Late night shooters, got 'em thinking Johnny Carson back
Trying to win this white man's game with my heart intact
All off a dollar and a dream that I really had
Kind of hard to sleep when your thoughts is in the streets
Norf Norf is the side where my family stay
Big Baby Jesus, I can't wait
Until the money coming in, spend it all on guns and rims
I ain't nothing but a nigga, ain't no reason to pretend

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
Kept the sticky in a Stussy pouch
Ski mask, bloody 'Preme hoodie tossing doobies out
The window of the hoopty, night black as Paul
Mooney at the movies but the moon was out
Food was always optional
Eating nothing but hard punches to that abdominal
Closed fist chronicles, sold sniff, Momma knew
Baggies laying 'round, peanut shells at a carnival
Stomping clowns, welcome pussy niggas to the romper room
Buckshot'll cover a whole torso like a parka do
In a park at two, plotting, trying to garner loot
Split it with his big road dog, call him Marmaduke
Searching for a shard of truth and found, uh
Couple bucks bought his cousins lunch
Another Dutch, stiff collar on the button-up
Hood, rich, wild, and 'bout to run amok
Road to Hell paved with cement
Covered trussled drugs, toughen up

[Refrain: Earl Sweatshirt]
"Well, alright. Okay
If that's how you truly feel about it, then
Alright, okay
If that's how you truly feel about it, then."

[Verse 3: Earl Sweatshirt]
Vinny Stape, they stupid, think the city safe
Until that little bindi placed, headshots, red dot
Block as hot as Denny plates, fed watch, Fed watch
Opinions only pity based, deep in the Civic with the
Evilest niggas this side of the Mississippi
All courtesy of Vincent from niggas who plot against
Ear-L-double-S, hear shells from the Tec
Hear in full-effect, eat a dick and cut a check, bitch
Few niggas I'm on a first-name basis with
Address him by the alias, that trunk weighted like he
'Bout to catch a case again, eighths louder than the voice of
Satan that be plaguing him, bruh, I'm caking
Whether Hell or bad weather, high water, I'm a sailor-type
Assailant for the paper, living like I met the maker twice
Hit it 'til I'm faded right? Mami, take a hike
Or treat it like you fucking shaking dice, bitch

[Refrain: Earl Sweatshirt]
"Well, alright. Okay
If that's how you truly feel about it, then
Alright, okay
If that's how you truly feel about it, then."

[Verse 1]
Is there anyone who ever remembers
Changing their mind from the paint on a sign?
Is there anyone who really recalls ever breaking rank, at all
For something someone yelled real loud, one time?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, everyone believes
In how they think it ought to be
Oh, everyone believes
And they're not going easily

[Verse 2]
Belief is a beautiful armor
But makes for the heaviest sword
Like punching underwater
You never can hit who you're trying for
Some need the exhibition
And some have to know they tried
It's the chemical weapon for the war that's ragin' on inside

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, everyone believes
From emptiness to everything
Oh, everyone believes
And no one's going quietly

[Chorus]
We're never going to win the world
We're never going to stop the war
We're never going to beat this, if belief is what we're fighting for
We're never going to win the world
We're never going to stop the war
We're never going to beat this, if belief is what we're fighting for

[Verse 3]
Is there anyone you can remember
Ever surrendered with their life on the line?

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
We're never going to win the world
We're never going to stop the war
We're never going to beat this, if belief is what we're fighting for
We're never going to win the world
We're never going to stop the war
We're never going to beat this, if belief is what we're fighting for

[Outro]
What puts a hundred thousand children in the sand?
Belief can, belief can
What puts the folded flag inside his mother's hand?
Belief can, belief can

[Intro: Lydia Pense & Lil Wayne]
You leave your home for days and days
Yeah (Hey)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne & Lydia Pense]
Money ain't shit, bitches ain't neither (But hey)
You know I'm on that grass, don't cut on the sprinklers (But hey)
Pussy on my mind, on my breath and on my fingers (But hey)
Niggas try to bite my style, but my style a jalapeño (Hey)
I got skinny ass jeans, trucks on the pocket (But hey)
Money talks, nigga, I'm caught up in that gossip (But hey)
You know all my bitches badder, and all my swishas fatter (But hey)
I milk this shit like cattle, that's my word like Scrabble
And yo main girl is a ho, I go Wayne's World in her throat
She swallow so many nuts, you fuck around, find a squirrel in her throat
I go tapeworm in that ho, let my snake squirm in that ho
Nigga we take turns in that ho, these niggas so green they glow
I am the best thing since wet pussy, on my private jet with my chef cookin'
So big-headed, my neck crooked, my niggas foul when the ref's lookin'
My big bro is Mack Maine, so much weed I got grass stains
Deez nuts, that's baggage claim, I'm on them trees like Candy Canes
Lil Tunechi (Hey)

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz & Lydia Pense]
(But hey) Yeah, 2 Chainz (But hey)
I might book me for a show (But hey)
Charge my ass the low and pick up the whole dough (But hey)
That's hustlenomics, I was high in my class pictures (But hey)
I like math, all I did was add bitches (Hey)
Swagga galore, got your girl on all fours (But hey)
It's not doggystyle, I call it froggystyle (Hey)
You dog her out, I tell her, hop in (Hey)
2 Chainz, my first chain had a twin
Gas in my blunt, watching ESPN
And, if that pussy good I wanna see her again
Yeah, I'm from College Park and I got ya broad with me (With me)
Salt water pool, I can put a shark in it (Damn)
Everything authentic (Tru), plus I named my pistols
Last name "Fuck," first name "I Don't Give A" (Bah)
Pockets look pregnant, they 'bout to deliver
So when I start pimpin', you know the procedure, yeah

[Refrain: Lydia Pense & Lil Wayne]
You leave your home for days and days
Alright, uh (Hey)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne & Lydia Pense]
All my niggas gangstas, all my bitches freaks (But he—)
I tickle her pussy, got that pussy tickle pink (Hey)
I'm the heart of the streets, and I just skipped a beat (But hey)
And if that pussy sweet, I want that candy, trick or treat (But hey)
I got diamonds in my teeth, so all my words are precious (But—)
I'm so fuckin' hot I sssssss, I'ma need some more S's
Man I'm on some other shit, I want another bitch
That want another bitch, and I don't cuddle bitch
I hit her with that shovel dick, I got in that pussy and dug a ditch
Some people gotta punch the clock, man I rather punch a brick
'Cause I'm that nigga, and I'm so cold I just shivered
These niggas think they hard, these niggas just nipples
I pop a nigga like a 'sicle, drop a nigga like a missle
Mo' money mo' issues, I size you up then fit you
Tunechi

[Outro: Lydia Pense]
You leave your home for days and days

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I ain't lookin' back, nigga
I'm a douchebag to these pussy ass niggas
Hammer in my drawers but I nail your bitch
Blunts like fingers, I'm 'bout to make a fist
Everybody die, gon' bury me alive
Grab life by the horns, put the bullshit aside
Glock clip full like the moon in the sky
I'm at the gas station adding fuel to the fire
Life ain't shit but bitches and money
I pass that weed, like I studied
Bury me in fire and watch me phoenix
Highway to Heaven, I'm taking the scenic
You tied to the track of my train of thoughts
And controlling my thoughts is like taming sharks
And these hoes wanna kick it with me, I'm a sensei
And I got fat pockets, you niggas in shape
Tools on deck, tattoos on necks
Life is a bitch, I'll make her your ex
Better turn to God 'fore I turn to Godzilla
How the fuck you gon' talk shit to diarrhea
Motherfucker it's on, I'm just rubbing 'em wrong
Put a bug in my ear, but not in my phone
I'll have a broke motherfucker run in your home
For a crumb and a bone
And put —

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
One in ya dome
One in ya dome, one in ya dome
One in ya dome, one in ya dome
One in ya dome, one in ya dome
One in ya dome, one in ya dome
Empty stomach, full clip
I'm gon' get it, gon' get it
Empty stomach
