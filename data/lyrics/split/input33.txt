bad

[Verse 2]
Wendy, Wendy don't lose your head
Lose your head
Wendy don't believe a word he says
I can't picture you with him
His future looks awful dim

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Wendy I wouldn't hurt you like that
No no no
I thought we had our love down pat
Guess I was wrong
The farthest thing from my mind
Was the day that I'd wake up to find
My Wendy
Wendy left me alone

[Chorus] 

[3x]

[Outro]
Wendy, Wendy

Check my custom machine

[Verse 1]
Well, she's metal flake blue with a corvette grill
(Check my custom machine)
And they say it looks better when she's standing still
(Check my custom machine)

[Chorus]
When I step on the gas she goes wa aa aa
I'll let you look but don't touch my custom machine

[Verse 2]
Well, with naugahyde bucket seats in front and back
(Check my custom machine)
Everything is chrome, man, even my jack
(Check my custom machine)

[Chorus]
When I step on the gas she goes wa aa aa
I'll let you look but don't touch my custom machine

[Verse 3]
With stereophonic speaker set with vibra sonic sound

Magnesium spokes, it stands an inch off the ground
(Check my custom machine)

[Chorus]
When I step on the gas she goes wa aa aa
I'll let you look but don't touch my custom machine

[Outro]
Oo oo oo

Oooo Merry Christmas Saint Nick
Christmas comes this time each year
Oooo

[Verse 1]
Well, way up north where the air gets cold
There's a tale about Christmas that you've all been told
And a real famous cat all dressed up in red
And he spends the whole year working out on his sled

[Chorus]
It's the little Saint Nick (Ooo little Saint Nick)
It's the little Saint Nick (Ooo little Saint Nick)

[Verse 2]
Just a little bobsled we call it old Saint Nick (Ooo)
But she'll walk a toboggan with a four speed stick (Ooo)
She's candy-apple red with a ski for a wheel (Ooo)
And when Santa hits the gas, man, just watch her peel (Ooo)

[Chorus]
It's the little Saint Nick (Ooo little Saint Nick)
It's the little Saint Nick (Ooo little Saint Nick)

[Bridge]
Run, run, reindeer
Run, run, reindeer (Woah, woah-oh)
Run, run, reindeer
Run, run, reindeer
He don't miss no one

[Verse 3]
And hauling through the snow at a frightening speed (Ooo)
With a half a dozen deer with Rudy to lead (Ooo)
He's gotta wear his goggles because the snow really flies (Ooo)
And he's cruising every pad with a little surprise (Ooo)

[Chorus]
It's the little Saint Nick (Ooo little Saint Nick)
It's the little Saint Nick (Ooo little Saint Nick)

[Outro / Fadeout]
Ohh, Merry Christmas Saint Nick (Ooo)
Christmas comes this time each year
Ohh, Merry Christmas Saint Nick (Ooo)
Christmas comes this time each year
Ohh, Merry Christmas Saint Nick (Ooo)
Christmas comes this time each year

[Chorus 1]
No-go showboat no-go showboat (no-go showboat)

[Verse 1]
Well, I got a wild custom that wins every show
But it's a no-go showboat (no-go showboat)
Yeah, but everybody knows that she just don't go
She's my no-go showboat (no-go showboat)
White wall slicks with racing mags
She's just for looks, man, not for drags

[Chorus 2]
'Cause it's a no-go showboat (no-go showboat)
No-go showboat no-go showboat (no-go showboat)

[Verse 2]
Well, the guys all dig it they've got no complaints
About my no-go showboat (no-go showboat)
And the chicks really flip for that metal flake paint
On my no-go showboat (no-go showboat)
It really rates fine in the custom clan
With hand-formed panels, tuck-and-roll rear pan

[Chorus 2]
'Cause it's a no-go showboat (no-go showboat)
No-go showboat no-go showboat (no-go showboat)

[Verse 3]
Well, the engine compartment's filled with all chrome goodies
In my no-go showboat (no-go showboat)
Yeah, but everybody takes me, even old Ford woodies
In my no-go showboat (no-go showboat)
When it comes to speed, man, I'm just out of luck
I'm even shut down by the ice cream truck

[Chorus 2]
'Cause it's a no-go showboat (no-go showboat)
No-go showboat no-go showboat (no-go showboat)
No-go showboat no-go showboat (no-go showboat)
No-go showboat no-go showboat (no-go showboat)

[Intro]
Ah ah ah ah oo ooo ooo oo ahh
The girls on the beach

[Verse 1]
On the beach you'll find them there
In the sun and salty air
The girls on the beach
Are all within reach
If you know what to do

[Chorus]
How we love to lie around
Girls with tans of golden brown
The girls on the beach
Are all within reach
And one waits there for you
(Girls on the beach)

[Verse 2]
The sun in her hair
The warmth of the air
On a summer day

[Chorus]
As the sun dips out of sight
Couples on the beach at night
The girls on the beach
Are all within reach
And with the boys tonight
(Girls on the beach)

[Outro]
Girls on the beach, girls on the beach

Oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo
Ah ah ah ah ahhhhh

[Verse]
Now a young man's gone
But his legend lingers on
For so much had he to give
But his life is through
For the story told is true
For he died just as he lived
For this daring young star
Met his death while in his car
No one knows the reason why
Screaming tire, flashing fire
And gone was this young star
Oh how could they let him die
Still a young man is gone
Yet his legend lingers on
For he died without a cause
And they say that he'll
Be known for evermore
As the Rebel Without A Cause

[Intro]
He's the man with all the toys

[Verse]
Someone found a lighted house late one night
And he saw through the window a sight
A big man in a chair
And little tiny men everywhere
He's the man with all the toys
Well how thrilled that someone must have been
And he must have been tempted to go in
He stayed out in the cold
And when he left them he told
About the man with all the toys

[Outro]
He's the man with all the toys
The man with all the toys
He's the man with all the toys
The man with all the toys

[Intro]
Ooo wah
Ooo wah

[Verse 1]
Everytime I have a date there's only one place to go
That's to the drive in
It's such a groovy place to talk and maybe watch a show
Down at the drive in
Forget about the plot, it'll do very well
But make sure you see enough so you're prepared to tell

[Chorus]
About the drive in
(Ooo wah)
I love the drive in
(We love the drive in, we love the drive in)

[Verse 2]
If the windows get fogged you'll have to take a breath
(Ooo waah ooo)
Down at the drive in
(Wah wah ooo)
Or the cat dressed in white will scare you both to death
Down at the drive in
A big buttered popcorn and an extra large coke
A few chili dogs and man I'm going broke

[Chorus]
Down at the drive in
(Ooo wah)
Yeah at the drive in
(We love the drive in, we love the drive in)

[verse 3]
Don't sneak your buddies in the trunk because they might get caught
By the drive in
(Wah wah wah ooo)
And they'd look kind of stupid getting chased through the lot
(Wah ooo)
Around the drive in

[Outro]
If you say you watch the movie you're a couple of liars
And "Remember only you can prevent forest fires"
Down at the drive in
(Ooo wah)
I love the drive in
(We love the drive in, we love the drive in)
Down at the drive in
(Ooo wah)
I love the drive in
(We love the drive in, we love the drive in)
Down at the drive in
(Ooo wah)
I love the drive in
(We love the drive in, we love the drive in)

[Intro]
I want to meet Santa Claus, the real real Santa

[x3]
He wants to meet old Santa Claus

[Verse]
I took my brother to the department store
He wanted to show Santa his Christmas list
He stood in line and he shook like a leaf
He's only five and a half going on six
He said, "Is that (that Santa) really Santa Claus, really really (the real Santa) Santa Claus?
Is that (that Santa) really Santa Claus, really really Santa? (I hope he doesn't pull Santa's beard)
Is that (that Santa) really Santa Claus, really really (the real Santa) Santa?"
Hope he thinks that's Santa Claus
I picked him up and put him on Santa's lap
And then he pulled the pillow out of his shirt
He yanked the beard right on off of his chin
And in his eyes I could see he was hurt
He said, "You're not (not Santa) really Santa Claus, you're really not (the real Santa) Santa Claus
You're not (not Santa) really Santa Claus, you're really not Santa (he shouldn't have pulled Santa's beard)
You're not (not Santa) Santa Claus, you're really not (the real Santa) Santa"
He's just helping Santa Claus

[Outro]
He's just helping (helping Santa) Santa Claus, the real (the real Santa) real Santa

[x3]
He's just helping Santa Claus

[All Spoken]

Hey, will you take off that hat? You look like George Washington!
I'll throw you across the river
You'll throw me across? The what? The Pontiac?
I'll throw you across the river. I threw a silver dollar across, I can
Throw you
When you hear the countdown, everyone shut up because it's awful tight

[Bridge]
Yeah

Sitting in my car
Say t-shirts
T-shirts in my car

Oh thanks!

Is this mike on?

[Outro]
All the way from Hawthorne California we're flying over Carl Wilson who's
Going to jump 600 feet into a two foot cup
Into a damp rag
Come on
Hey look, I'm going to leave you home
Hey you guys just a second, I forgot my note
Just a second I'm going to go to the piano
O.k. let's make one Charlie
You guys ready, let's go

[Verse]
The Christmas spirit grows with each new day
And it's so close but seems so far away
And yet it comes only once a year
And before you know it, it's already here
The streets are filled with laughter
And so many hearts are gay

Everybody helps to make the spirit bright
The houses turn on their Christmas lights at night
It's worth the wait the whole year through
Just to make happy someone like you
And I'll never outgrow the thrill of Christmas day

It's worth the wait the whole year through
Just to make happy someone like you
And I'll never outgrow the thrill of Christmas day

[Outro]
It's worth the wait the whole year through
Just to make happy someone like you

[Verse 1]
Frosty the Snowman
Was a jolly happy soul
With a corn-cob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

Frosty the Snowman
Is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow
But the children know
How he came to life one day

There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around

Frosty the Snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
Frosty the Snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said, "Let's run
And we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away"

Down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there
All around the square
Saying, "Catch me if you can"

He led them down
The streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment
When he heard them holler, "Stop!"

Frosty the Snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye
Saying, "Don't you cry
I'll be back again some day"

[Verse 1]
We three kings of Orient are
Bearing gifts, we traverse far
Field and fountain
Moor and mountain
Following yonder star

[Chorus]
Oh, star of wonder, star of might
Star with royal beauty bright
Westward leading
Still proceeding
Guide us to thy perfect light

[Verse 2]
Born a babe on Bethlehem's plain
Gold we bring to crown him again
King forever, ceasing never
Over us all to reign

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Frankincense to offer have I
Incense owns a deity nigh
Prayer and praising, all men raising
Worship God on high

[Chorus]

[Verse]
I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't mean a thing if you're not here with me
I'll have a blue Christmas, that's certain
And when that blue heartache starts hurting

[Outro]

[x2]
You'll be doing all right with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas

[Chorus 1]
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

[Verse]
He's making a list
He's checking it twice
He's going to find out
Who's naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town

[Chorus 2]
He's sees you when you're sleeping
He knows if you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness' sake

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 1]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

[Verse 2]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

[Outro]
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

[Verse]
I'll be home for Christmas
You can plan on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents on the tree

[Bridge]
Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams

[Outro]

[x2]
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

[Verse 1: Mike Love]
She come out with her best friend for the summer in L.A
They took a small apartment down on the beach
Where you'll find them there every day
And I said

[Chorus 1: Brian Wilson]
California guys all can't peel their eyes
From that girl from New York City
And L.A. boys all heard the noise
About that girl from New York City

[Verse 2: Mike Love]
We'll turn them on with all the things that will be happening night and day
We'll show them such a groovy time that they'll both be deciding to stay
And let me say

[Chorus 1: Brian Wilson]
California guys all can't peel their eyes
From that girl from New York City
And L.A. boys all heard the noise
About that girl from New York City

[Chorus 2: Brian Wilson]

[x2]
California guys all can't peel their eyes
From that girl from New York City
And L.A. boys all heard the noise
About that girl from New York City

[Verse]
Let's take your car and to amusement parks USA
At Palisades in Salisbury Parks the rolly coasters are flying
At Euclid Beach on the flying turns I'll bet you can't keep her smiling
Buy your girl a cotton candy while you're down on the ground
Then take her on the twirl-a-way and spin her around
Let's take your car and mess around at the park all day
The parachutes at Riverview Park will shake us up all day
And Disneyland and P.O.P. is worth a trip to L.A
Watchin' girls in the air can really get you bad
And I'll bet the laughing lady makes you laugh like mad
Let's pick up our friends and do amusement parks USA

Hurry, hurry, hurry folks step right up to the Beach Boy circus. The best little show in town. Hurry, hurry, hurry, it's only a dime folks, one thin dime, just one tenth of a dollar. Come on in and see Stella the snake dancer (Is it real?) She walks, she talks, she wiggles on her belly like a reptile. (She looks like a fake to me) (Let's go see her) (It costs too much) Hurry, hurry, hurry folks, come on and see Stella. She shimmies, she shakes
You'll crash and burn in the bumper cars at Jersey's steel pier
You'll crack them up when you stand in front of all the crazy mirrors
At first you'll be a chicken at the jackhammer ride
But you'll do it with a girl sittin' right by your side
Let's take your car and mess around at the park all day

[Verse 1: The Beach Boys]
Should old acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind
Should old acquaintance be forgot
And days of Auld Lang Syne
For Auld Lang Syne, my dear

[Verse 2: Denny]
Hi, this is Denny, and speaking for the rest of the guys. I'd like to say that it has been a great pleasure for all of us to bring you this Christmas album. We hope you will treasure it the way we do. And if you happen to be listening to this album right now, Mike, Brian, Carl, Al and I would like to wish every one of you a very merry Christmas, and we hope the new year brings you as much happiness as this year has brought us. Thank you very much

[Outro: The Beach Boys]
May old acquaintance be forgot
And days of Auld Lang Syne

[Verse 1]
Well I walked up to her and I asked her if she wanted to dance
She looked awful nice and so I hoped she might take a chance
When we danced I held her tight
Then I walked her home that night
And all the stars were shining bright

[Chorus]
And then I kissed her

[Verse 2]
Each time I saw her I couldn't wait to see her again
I wanted to let her know that I was more than a friend
I didn't know just what to do
And so I whispered I love you
And she said that she loved me too

[Chorus]
And then I kissed her

[Bridge]
I kissed her in a way that I'd never kissed a girl before
I kissed her in a way that I hope she liked for evermore

[Verse 3]
I knew that she was mine so I gave her all the love that I had
Then one day she'll take me home to meet her mom and her dad
Then I asked her to be my bride
And always be right by my side
I felt so happy that I almost cried

[Chorus]
And then I kissed her
And then I kissed her
And then I kissed her

[Verse 1]
Down in Utah
The guys and I dig a city called Salt Lake
It's got the grooviest kids
That's why we never get tired of Salt Lake
And the way the kids talk so cool
Is an out of sight thing
And the number one radio station
Makes the town really swing yeah

[Chorus]
Salt Lake City we'll be coming soon

[Verse 2]
There's a park near the city, yeah
All the kids dig the Lagoon now
It's full of all kinds of girls
And rides and we'll be flyin' there soon now
And girl for girl
They've got the cutest of the Western states
They got the sun in the summer
And winter time the skiing is great yeah

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Outro]
We'll be coming soon

[x3]

[Verse 1]
Hi little girl, it's me
Don't you know who I am?
I met you last summer
When I came up to stay with my gran
I'm the guy-uy-uy who
Left you with tears in his eyes
You didn't answer my letters
So I figured it was just a lie

[Verse 2]
Your hair's getting longer and your shorts
Mmm they sure fit you fine
I'll bet you went out
Every night during ol' school time
But this ti-I-ime I'm not gonna count on you
I'll see you this summer
And forget you when I go back to school

[Chorus]
Girl don't tell me you'll write-ite-ite
Girl don't tell me you'll write-ite-ite
Girl don't tell me you'll write me again this time

[Verse 1]
Hi little girl, it's me
Don't you know who I am?
I met you last summer
When I came up to stay with my gran
Said I'm the guy-uy-uy who
Left you with tears in his eyes
You didn't answer my letters
So I figured it was just a lie

[Chorus]
Girl don't tell me you'll write-ite-ite
Girl don't tell me you'll write-ite-ite
Girl don't tell me you'll write me again this time

[Outro]
Girl don't tell me you'll write me again this time

[Verse 1]
When I watched you walk with him
Tears filled my eyes
And when I heard you talk with him
I couldn't stand his lies
And now before he tries it
I hope you realize it

[Chorus]
Let him run wild
He don't care (Let him run!)
Let him run wild
He'll find out (Let him run!)
Let him run wild
He don't care

[Verse 2]
(Guess you know I waited for you)
He'll do the same to other girls
That he did to you
Then one day he'll run in to one
That's gonna hurt him too
Before he makes you over
I'm gonna take you over

[Chorus]
Let him run wild
He don't care (Let him run!)
Let him run wild
He'll find out (Let him run!)
Let him run wild
He don't care

[Verse 3]
(Guess you know I waited for you girl)
All the dreams you shared with him
You might as well forget
I know you need a truer love
And that's what you'll get
And now that you don't need him
Well he can have his freedom

[Chorus]
Let him run wild
He don't care (Let him run!)
Let him run wild
He'll find out (Let him run!)
Let him run wild
He don't care (Let him run!)
Let him run wild
He'll find out (Let him run!)
Let him run wild
He don't care (Let him run!)

[Verse 1]
You're kind of small
And you're such a doll
I'm glad you're mine
You're so good to me
How come you are?
You take my hand
And you understand
When I get in a bad mood
You're so good to me
And I love it, love it

[Chorus]
You're my baby
Oh yeah
Don't mean maybe
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
I know your eyes
Are not on the guys
When we're apart
You're so true to me
How come you are?
And every night
You hold me so tight
When I kiss you goodbye
You're so good to me
And I love it, love it

[Chorus]
You're my baby
Oh yeah
Don't mean maybe
Oh yeah

[Outro]
You're my baby
Oh yeah
Don't mean maybe
Oh yeah
You're my baby
Oh yeah
Don't mean maybe
Oh yeah
You're my baby
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm bugged at my old man
Because he's making me stay in my room (Darn my dad)
I came in a little late
And my old man, he just blew his mind (Blew it bad)
Why did he sell my surfboard?
He cut off my hair last night in my sleep

[Verse 2]
I wish I could see outside
But he tacked up boards on my window (Gosh it's dark)
I can't hit the surf, can't drag
Can't do a doggone thing (Wish I could)
I tried to call up my chick
But he jerked my phone right out of the wall

[Verse 3]
They gave me some breadcrumbs
And a little glass of water
And they're out there eating steak (Smells so good)
I ripped up my wardrobe
And I'm growing a beard
Oh, when will they let me come out?

[Verse 4]
I'd listen to my radio
But he took it and he's using it in his own room (Now it's gone)
I wish I could do some homework
But I got suspended from school (Blew my cool)

[Outro]
I'm bugged at my old man
And he doesn't even know where it's at

[Verse]
You're so sleepy
Wish that he could stay
Love him so
But now it's getting late
He'll be waiting
Waiting just for you
One more summer
And your dream comes true

[Intro]
Play it like it is, Carl!
Pick it up from the third!)
(Ha!)

[Chorus 1]
Well, there's a dance spreading round like an awful disease
Hully, hully gully
You just shake your shoulders and you wiggle your knees
(Play it like it is!)
Hully, hully gully

[Chorus 1]
Well, there's a dance spreading round from coast to coast
Hully, hully gully
Well, when me and my baby do it, that's how we do it the most
Hully, hully gully

[Chorus 2]
Mama hully gully
Papa hully gully
Baby hully gully, too

[Verse 1]
Well, I went to a party now and what did they do?
Hully, hully gully
Well now everybody's doing it on their way too
Hully, hully gully
Everybody's looking like they got the shakes
Hully, hully gully
You just wiggle your shoulders, man, that's all it takes
Hully, hully gully

[Chorus 2]

(Let's tear them down!)

[Bridge]
Hully, hully gully
Do it with your left shoulder
Hully, hully gully
Do it with your other shoulder, now
Hully, hully gully
Switch your blades
Hully, hully gully

Mama hully gully
Papa hully gully
Baby hully gully too
(How about "Me and My Girl"?)

[Chorus 2]
Mama hully gully
Papa hully gully
You can hully gully too

[Outro]
(Whoa!)
(That's all ...)
(What do you know?)
(Before we bring on the star of our show this evening...)
(What else do you know?)
(Uh, he knows...)
(What?)

[Intro]
(Just groovy.)
(Beatle?)
(What is it, what is it?)
(No--hey, faster)
(It's Paul. Paul is the...)
(Who?)
(Paul!)

[Verse]
I should have known better with a girl like you
That I would love everything that you do
And I do, hey hey hey, and I do
(Faster!)
Woah-oh I should have realized what a kiss could be
That this could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see
That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're going to say you love me too, oo oo oo oo
Bow bow bow
And when I ask you to be mi-i-i-ine
You're going to say you love me too
You love me too
(Harmonics!)
You love me too

[x2]
(Great. Now, "Tell Me Why." How does that go? That's my favorite Beatles song.)
(One more time. Tell me why.)
(Who knows.)
(Hey, 7Up! I want some 7Up.)
(Hey, I got some.)
(Over here, I want some ice cubes!)

[Chorus]
Ah, Papa-oom-muh-muh-muh-muh
Ah, Papa-oom-mow-mow
Papa-oom-mow-mow

[x2]
Dit-dit-dit
Papa-oom-mow-mow

[x2]
Dit-dit-dit
Papa-oom-mow-mow

[x2]

[Bridge]
The funniest sound I ever heard
Papa-oom-mow-mow

[x2]
But I can't understand a single word
Papa-oom-mow-mow

[x2]
But if he's serious or if he's playing
Whoo, my my is all he's saying
Papa, whooo

[Intro]
(Downbeat, Denny. Denny. Downbeat!)
(What?)
(Get out of here!)
(Oh, man!)
(Oh, rock out!)

[Verse]
Standing on a mountain looking down on a city
The way I feel is a doggone pity
Teardrops falling down the mountainside
Many times I've been here, many times I've cried
We used to be so happy when we were in love
High on a mountain of love
Night after night I'm a-standing here alone
Weeping out my heart till the cold grey dawn
Praying that you're lonely and you'll come here too
Hoping just by chance that I'll get a glimpse of you
(Oh yeah!)
Trying hard to find you somewhere up above
High on a mountain of love

[Pre-Chorus]
The mountain of love, the mountain of love
You should be ashamed
You used to be a mountain of love
But you just changed your name

[Chorus]
Way down below there's a half a million people
Somewhere there's a church with a big tall steeple
Inside the church, there's an altar filled with flowers
Wedding bells are ringing and they should've been ours
That's why I'm so handy, my dream is gone above
High on a mountain of love

(Keep playing it like it is!)

High on a mountain of love

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
Way down below there's a half a million people
Somewhere there's a church with a big tall steeple
Inside the church, there's an altar filled with flowers
Wedding bells are ringing and they should've been ours
That's why I'm so handy, my dream is gone above
High on a mountain of love

[x4]

[Outro]
(What, honey?)
High on a mountain of love
(Hahahaha)
Ooh baby...
(That's good.)
One more time. Oooh baby. Ooo

[Intro]
Hey hey hey
Da da da
That's what I say

[Verse 1]
There's a man in the funny papers we all know
Alley Oop Oop, Oop Oop Oop
He lived way back a long time ago
Alley Oop Oop, Oop Oop Oop
Well he don't eat nothing but bearcat stew
Alley Oop Oop, Oop Oop Oop
Oh well this cat's name is a-Alley Oop
Alley Oop Oop, Oop Oop Oop

[Chorus]
He's the toughest man there is alive
Alley Oop
Wears clothes from a wildcat's hide
Alley Oop
He's the king of the jungle jive
Look at that caveman go!

[Verse 2]
He's got a chauffeur that's a genuine dinosaur
Alley Oop Oop, Oop Oop Oop
And he can knuckle your head before you count to four
Alley Oop Oop, Oop Oop Oop
He's got a big ugly club and a headful of hair
Alley Oop Oop, Oop Oop Oop
He's oohhhh eating grizzly bear
Alley Oop Oop, Oop Oop Oop
Forgot the words!

[Chorus]
He's the toughest man there is alive
Alley Oop
Wears clothes from a wildcat's hide
Alley Oop
He's the king of the jungle jive
Look at that caveman go!

[Verse 3]
He rides through the jungle tearing limbs offa trees
Alley Oop Oop, Oop Oop Oop
And knocking great big monsters dead on their knees
Alley Oop Oop, Oop Oop Oop
Other cats don't bug him because they know better
Alley Oop Oop, Oop Oop Oop
Because he's a mean motor scooter and a bad go-getter
Alley Oop Oop, Oop Oop Oop

[Chorus]
Well, uh, he's the toughest man there is alive
Alley Oop
Wears clothes from a wildcat's hide
Alley Oop
He's a hully gully king of jive
Well look at that caveman go!

[Bridge]
There he goes
(There he goes)
Alley Oop Oop, Oop Oop Oop
Look at that caveman go
Alley Oop Oop, Oop Oop Oop
Ride, daddy, ride
Alley Oop Oop, Oop Oop Oop
Heigh-ho, dinosaur
Alley Oop Oop, Oop Oop Oop
Oh my goodness, what a big brute he is! Hm!
Alley Oop Oop, Oop Oop Oop
Oh, how would you like a dinosaur like that, for your own? Mm!
Alley Oop Oop, Oop Oop Oop

[Verse 1]
Here I stand, head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone, I can't go on
Feeling two-foot small
(Shhhhhhhhh!)
(This is great!)
Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

[Chorus]
(Go!)
Hey! You've got to hide your love away
Hey! You've got to hide your love away
(Hey hey.)

[Verse 2]
How can I even try?
I can never win
Hear them, see them
In the state I'm in
(Be quiet)
How could she say to me
"Love will find a way"
Gather 'round, all you clowns
Let me hear you say

[Chorus]
(Hey!)
Hey! You've got to hide your love away
Hey! You've got to hide your love away

[Bridge]
Do do doooo do-do-do

(Hey!)
(What's the best Everly Brothers song? Besides, ah...)
(Go.)
("Bird Dog.")
(Who's going to fool with it?)
(You're going to fool with it. You and me.)
(You shouldn't fool with an Everly Brothers song you should do it right.)
(Just like we fooled with "Wake Up Little Susie.")
(No, ah, "Devoted To You.")
("Devoted To You." Well, Carl, do you know the guitar part?)
(Yeah.)
(You must know the guitar part.)
(Here, I've got it right here.)
(He's gotta go check the ... now.)

[Lots of chatter and laughter]
(That's it!)
(How are you going to sing a slow song like that one if nobody will shut up?)
(Hey, be quiet will ya?)
(Just die your hair bright red.)
(Hey, shh, just be quiet and let us sing it.)
(Just shut up for a little while because Brian and I are gonna sing it.)
(If you don't know it, then shut up and go home!)
(Yes!)

[Intro]
(Good to my baby)
(Good to my baby)
(Good to my baby)
(Good to my baby)

[Verse 1: Brian Wilson, Mike Love]
They think I'm bad and I treat her so mean
But all they know is from what they've seen
And when I get her alone now
You know we're happy as a couple could be
And when I give her my love it's between her and me

[Chorus: Whole Group]
She's my girl and I'm good to my baby
She's my girl and I'm good to my baby
And I know she's happy with me
(Good to my baby)
(Good to my baby)

[Verse 2: Brian Wilson, Mike Love]
Some guys may think they'd be better for her
But she knows just what she wants for sure
And when we're out with our friends now
You know that we never have to put on a show
And we stay together while other couples come and go

[Chorus: Whole Group]
She's my girl and I'm good to my baby
She's my girl and I'm good to my baby
And I know she's happy with me
(Good to my baby)
(Good to my baby)

She's my girl and I'm good to my baby

[Guitar Intro: Carl Wilson]

[Verse 1: Mike Love]
There she goes she ran in her room
She'll probably stay in there the rest of the day
It sounds like it must have been something you said
You know she's awful used to getting her way

[Chorus 1: Brian Wilson, Group]
Why don't you kiss her (Why don't you kiss her)
And while you kiss her (Tell her you miss her)
Why don't you treat her (Why don't you treat her)
Treat her nice

[Chorus 2: Group]
Don't hurt my little sister
Don't hurt my little sister
Don't hurt my little sister

[Verse 2: Mike Love]
You know she digs you and thinks you're a real groovy guy
But yet I'm not sure that I feel the same
We both know that you've been making her cry
I hope you don't think it's some kind of game

[Chorus 1: Brian Wilson, Group]
Why don't you love her (Why don't you love her)
Like her big brother (Like her big brother)
Why don't you tell her (Why don't you tell her)
Tell her you're sorry

[Chorus 2: Group]
Don't hurt my little sister
Don't hurt my little sister
Don't hurt my little sister

[Instrumental]

[Outro: Group, Brian Wilson]
Don't hurt my little sister (Why don't you love her)
Don't hurt my little sister (Like a big brother)
Don't hurt my little sister

[Verse 1]
Darling, you can count on me
Til the sun dries up the sea
Until then, I'll always be
Devoted to you

I'll be yours through endless time
I'll adore your charms sublime
Guess by now you know that I'm
Devoted to you

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll never hurt you, I'll never lie
I'll never be untrue
I'll never give you reason to cry
I'd be unhappy if you were blue

[Chorus]
Through the years, my love will grow
Like a river, it will flow
It can't die because I'm so
Devoted to you

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll never hurt you, I'll never lie
I'll never be untrue
I'll never give you reason to cry
I'd be unhappy if you were blue

[Chorus]
Through the years, my love will grow
Like a river, it will flow
It can't die because I'm so
Devoted to you

Ba ba ba ba ba

(That was beautiful.)
(Great.)
(Yay!)
(That was great.)
(Hey, Brian, I ...)

[Chorus: Group]
When I grow up to be a man

[Verse 1: Mike Love, Brian Wilson]
Will I dig the same things that turn me on as a kid?
Will I look back and say that I wish I hadn't done what I did?
Will I joke around and still dig those sounds

[Chorus: Group]
When I grow up to be a man?

[Verse 2: Mike Love, Group, Brian Wilson]
Will I look for the same things in a woman that I dig in a girl?
(fourteen, fifteen)
Will I settle down fast or will I first wanna travel the world?
(sixteen, seventeen)
Now I'm young and free, but how will it be

[Chorus: Group]
When I grow up to be a man?

[Bridge: Group]
Oooooh
Oooooh
Oooooh

[Verse 3: Mike Love, Group, Brian Wilson]
Will my kids be proud or think their old man is really a square?
(eighteen, nineteen)
When they're out having fun, yeah
Will I still want to have my share?
(twenty, twenty-one)
Will I love my wife for the rest of my life (rest of my life)

[Chorus: Group]
When I grow up to be a man?
What will I be when I grow up to be a man?

[Outro: Group, Mike Love, Brian Wilson]
(twenty-two, twenty-three)
Won't last forever
(twenty-four, twenty-five)
It's kind of sad
(twenty-six, twenty-seven)
Won't last forever
(twenty-eight, twenty-nine)
It's kind of sad
(thirty thirty-one)
Won't last forever
(thirty-two)

[Intro]
There's a story
I want you to know
About my baby
And how I love her so

[Chorus]
Oh ohhhh, there's no other
Like my baby, oh no no no
Oh, there's no other
Don't mean maybe, oh no no no

[Verse 1]
Walking down the street
In a crowd
Looking at my baby
Feeling so proud

Woah, there's no other
Like my baby, oh no no no
Woah, there's no other
Don't mean maybe, oh no no no

Whispered to her
Someday she'll be my bride

Don't mean maybe, oh no no no

[Verse 1: Mike Love]
After six hours of school I've had enough for the day
I hit the radio dial and turn it up all the way

[Chorus: Brian Wilson, Group, Mike Love]
I got to dance (Dance, dance, dance now the beat's really hot)
Right on the spot (Dance, dance, dance right there on the spot)
The beat's really hot (Dance, dance, dance now the beat's really hot)

[Verse 2: Mike Love]
When I feel put down I try to shake it off quick
With my chick by my side the radio does the trick

[Chorus: Brian Wilson, Group, Mike Love]
I got to dance (Dance, dance, dance now the beat's really hot)

[Verse 1: Brian Wilson]
Now here we are together
This would've been worth waiting forever
I always knew it'd feel this way
And please forgive my shaking
Can't you tell my heart is breaking?
Can't make myself say what I planned to say

[Chorus: Brian Wilson, Group]
Baby, please let me wonder
If I've been the one you love
Please let me wonder
If I'm who you're dreaming of
Please let me wonder, love

[Verse 2: Brian Wilson]
I built all my goals around you
That some day my love would surround you
You'll never know what we've been through
For so long I thought about it
And now I just can't live without it
This beautiful image I have of you

[Chorus: Brian Wilson, Group]
Baby, please let me wonder
If I've been the one you love
Please let me wonder
If I'm who you're dreaming of
Please let me wonder, love

[Instrumental Bridge: Lead organ and guitar]

[Chorus: Brian Wilson, Group]
Please let me wonder
If I've been the one you love
Please let me wonder
If I'm who you're dreaming of
Please let me wonder, love

[Outro: Carl Wilson]
I love you

[Intro: Brian Wilson]
I have a girlfriend
She says I'm her only one

[Verse 1: Brian Wilson]
We want to get married
But we're so young
So young
Can't marry no one
They say our love is
Just a teenage affection
But no one knows
Our hearts' direction

[Chorus: Brian Wilson]
So young
Can't marry no one
I'm I'm I'm so young
I'm I'm I'm so young
I'm I'm I'm so young
Can't marry no one, no one

Their mother's baby
Will have seen the last of me

Get around round round, I get around

Get around round round, I get a square
(Ow!)

[Verse 1]
I'm getting awfully mad driving down the street
I just don't want to be bugged sitting next to my sweets
Bom bom bom ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta
The other guys are pretty tough
So those other gats over there better not get tough

[Chorus]
I get around
Get around round round, I get around
From town to town
Get around round round, I get around
I'm a real cool head

(Anybody)
(Come on, baby!)

[?]

[Verse 2]
We always take my car although it's a heap
And we never get turned down by the chicks we pick up on
Not much...
None of the guys go steady because it wouldn't be Right Guard
To leave their best girls home on a Saturday night

[Chorus]
I get around
Get around round round, I get around
From town to town
Get around round round, I get around
I'm a real cool head
Get around round round, I get around

(Oh, that was really bad.)
(Let's do "Little Deuce Coupe" while .... Real fast, obviously.)
(I've got it, Brian. Here, Bruce, do your famous ....)
(Oh.)
(Bom bom.)
(Like this.)
(Hey, do the)
(Oh)

[Verse 3]
Well I'm not bragging, babe, so don't put me down
Well, I've got the cutest little piece in town
Well, I'm not bragging, babe, oh yeah
(... Carl ...)
(We lost it.)
She's my little deuce coupe
(Hey, Carl.)
You don't know what I got
Talk to me, baby

[x2]
Well I'm not bragging, babe, so don't put me down
But I've got the fastest set of wheels in town
When something comes up to me he don't even try
Because if I had a set of wings, man, I know she could fly
Hey
My little deuce coupe
You don't know what I
Little deuce coupe
Yeah
You don't know what I got
She's got a competition clutch with the four on the floor
And she purrs like a kitten till the lake pipes roar
Ah, bom bom bom bom
And if that ain't enough to make you flip your lid
There's one more thing: I got the pink slip daddy
Oh yeah
Da da dom da da dom ba da
(Oh, let's do "Luau"!)
(Talk to me, baby!)
She comes on like a rose, da da dap
(Do the stroll!)
She's my little deuce coupe
You don't know what I got

[Verse 1: Group, Brian Wilson, Mike Love]
Please don't let me argue anymore
I won't make you worry like before
Can't remember what we fought about
Late late last night we said it was over
But I remember when we thought it out
We both had a broken heart

[Chorus: Mike Love, Group]
Woah Baby (Kiss me Baby)
Woah Baby (Love to hold you)
Woah Baby (Kiss me baby)
Woah Baby (Love to hold you)

[Verse 2: Group, Brian Wilson, Mike Love]
As I drove away I felt a tear
It hit me I was losing someone dear
Told my folks I would be alright
Tossed and I turned, my head was so heavy
Then I wondered as it got light
Were you still awake like me?

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Oh, one more time
(And I didn't want ....)
(Hey Al, ....)
(What?)
(...)
(Al's gonna sing a 'test song.)
(Yeah, sing it for us.)
(Sing a what?)
(A 'test song. It was a protest song until you tried it. Now it's a 'test.)
(Do a little protest.)
(I can't hear you, Ally.)
(Yay, I'm gonna give Al a hand.)
(I can't hear you, Al.)
(Yay for Al.)
(Can't hear you, Al.)

Come gather round people, wherever you roam
And admit that the waters around you have grown
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone
(Right!) 

[Laughter]
If your time to you is worth saving
Then you'd better start swimming or you'll sink like a stone
(Glug.) (Wrong!)
For the times they are a-changing
Come writers and critics who prophesize with your pen
(Right!)
And keep your eyes wide, the chance won't come again
(Wrong!)
And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin
And there's no telling who that it's naming
(No!)
Because the loser now will be later to win
For the times they are a-changing

Come mothers and fathers throughout the land
("Eve of Destruction")
And don't criticize what you can't understand
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly aging
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend your hand
For the times they are a-changing

[?]
(... put on your shoes.)

[?]
(Wait a second, where's the note? ...)
Bar, Bar, Bar
(Oh shit...)
Bar, Bar, Bar
(Go back to the piano.)
(F sharp, wasn't it?)
(I can't read. 

[Laugh])
(Let's go.)
(What note? What where's the note?)
Ba ba ba, you don't know how to sing, "Ba ba black sheep, have you any wool?"
Yes sir, no sir, none, just a little
(Oh, that was cute.)

[Chorus: Mike Love]
She knows me
She knows me

[Verse 1: Brian Wilson]
Sometimes I have a weird way of showing my love
And I always expect her to know what I'm thinking of

[Chorus: Mike Love]
She knows me

[Verse 2: Brian Wilson]
I treat her so mean I don't deserve what I have
And I think that she'll forget just by making her laugh
But she knows me

[Chorus 2: Brian Wilson]
Knows me so well
That she can tell
I really love her

[Verse 3: Brian Wilson]
I get so jealous of the other guy
And then I'm not happy til' I make her break down and cry
When I look at other girls it must kill her inside
But it'd be another story if she looked at the guys
But she knows me

[Chorus 2: Brian Wilson]
Knows me so well
That she can tell
I really love her

[Instrumental - Carl's Solo]

[Chorus: Mike Love]
She knows me
She knows me

[Verse 4: Brian Wilson]
When I look at other girls it must kill her inside
But it'd be another story if she looked at the guys
'Cause she knows me

[Chorus 2: Brian Wilson]
Knows me so well
That she can tell
I really love her

[Section 1]
On and on she go dum bee-doo-da
On and on she go dum bee-doo

[Verse 1: Dennis Wilson]
I'm blessed with everything
A world to which a man can cling
So happy times when I break out in tears
In the back of my mind I still have my fears

[Verse 2: Dennis Wilson]
I live my life with her
Love her true, she knows I'm sure
I make her happy just living so plain
In the back of my mind I'm afraid it's going to change

[Bridge: Dennis Wilson]
I tried to run far way from thoughts
I should try to keep away
But they just keep coming back to me
I tried to rationalize
But some day I might realize
That things are just gonna be the way they'll be

[Verse 3: Dennis Wilson]
I know it's so hard to find
A girl who really understands your mind
What will I do if I lose her
It will always be way in the back of my mind

[Verse 1]
The river's a bed of sweet berries and flowers
Banks of thirsty lies (Please be careful)
The stream is an eyeglass of heroes
Bridged with bright replies

[Pre-Chorus]
The creek is a funnel of forgiveness
Winning every prize

[Chorus]
Steamboat of living ever faithfully ride

[Verse 2]
The river's a dream in a waltz time
Banks of jasper glaze (Have a ball and sing)
The stream is a timepiece of children
Bridged with crystal haze

[Pre-Chorus]
The creek is a trumpet of hard times
Blowing tasty days

[Chorus]
Steamboat of living ever faithfully glide

[Post-Chorus]
Don't worry mister Fulton
We'll get your steamboat rolling

[Steel Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Don't worry mister Fulton
We'll get your steamboat rolling

Hey, there's onions on this, so I hope all you guys don't mind
Hi Earl
Here's some french fries you can all split
Oh, there's kosher pickles
Thank you for the french fries, I'm really uh
Everything's going be alright Marilyn
Thank you
Oops, okay, why don't Earl talk to Brian
You stepped on my french fries
Now, after the concert in Paris
Concert?
Which was a blast
You mean that that big all thing
That was a musically
I loved that concert, that was the best concert
I had a lot of fun
It was great
I thought it was our best show we ever played
It's great
I thought it, I liked it almost
First show, I only made three mistakes
I still haven't made a mistake my whole career
We keep waiting for you to make a mistake, Brian
Where was this place, we had the lamb wherever it was
Oh, that banquet we had
Yeah
Yeah, they brought in this big all lamb and Dennis and I had to sit there holding it up
Yeah, but it had its, you know, they cooked the whole lamb and put its raw head back on
Yeah, that's right
They didn't take the - they didn't even burn the hair off it
It's sitting, looking at you like
Well the whole European
French bread
Of all of Europe, the only thing that stuck out in my mind is the bread
I - you know you know who was a great help was Dick Raising, Capitol records representative over there, one of the greatest guys I've ever met in my life
He sent us a telegram
Hey, uh, hey Carl
Yeah? Get out of here
What, uh, what was the most fascinating experience you remember? What, what's the highlight?
Gee, I don't know I think Rome, it sticks out in my mind. It was such a beautiful place, I mean the Colosseum, I've never seen anything like that ever
Looks like it
When in Rome
You know I love England
The TV work is great there
If you notice, like, "Shindig" or "Halibalu" a lot of these TV shows are going after it
There's about six of them now
Or, well, all of the TV shows are all going after this sort of thing

[Verse]
Last night I took a walk in the dark
To a place called Palisades Park
To have some fun, to see what I could see
That's where the girls are
I took a ride on the shoopty shoop
The girl I sat with almost, almost puked
And when it stopped
She was holding hands with me
My arms were flying up like a rocket ship
Down like a roller coaster
Fast like a loopty loop
Then around like a merry-go-round

[Chorus]

[x2]
We even ate at a hot dog stand
We danced around to a rocking band
And when she winked, I gave that girl a hug
In the tunnel of love
You'll never know how great it just can feel
Until it stops at the top of the Ferris Wheel
I fell in love, down at Palisades Park

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Down at Palisades Park
Yeah, yeah, yeah
When at Palisades Park

[Verse]
Silken hair, more silken hair fell on her face
And no wind was blowing (She was kinda hip)
Silken hair, more silken hair lay near her pillbox
Down at her feet (She'd been on a trip)
I peek in and when I saw she'd lost her hair
I thought I would tell her (She was goin' bald)
When she saw her shining forehead, didn't stop
She swooned to the ground (Really flipped her wig)
Laughed so hard, I blew my mind
I blew my cool and blew myself over
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
What a blow (Sha-na-na)
Sha-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na (Yeah, blow)
Sha-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na (What a blow)
Sha-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na (Yeah, blow)
Sha-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na (Mmm, what a blow)
Sha-na-na, na-na

[Interlude]
She drew a comb across her scalp
And brushed what she had left
I tried to salvage what I could
And threw it in a sack
She made a bee line to her room
And grabbed all kind o' juice
She started pouring it on her head
And thought it'd grow it back!

[Chorus/Outro]
You're too late mama
Ain't nothin' upside your head
(No more, no more, no more, no more)
Upside your head
You're too late mama
Ain't nothin' upside your head
(No more, no more, no more, no more)
Upside your head
You're too late mama
Ain't nothin' upside your head
(No more, no more, no more, no more)

[Verse 1: Mike Love, Brian Wilson]
I wake up in the mornin' just to work all through the day
That sun can get so hot that you can sweat your strength away
And oh come the night time...

[Chorus]
Gettin' hungry
Hungry for my kind of woman
I'm gettin' hungry
Soon I gotta find me a woman
I'm gettin' hungry
Searchin' for a pretty girl

[Verse 2: Mike Love, Brian Wilson]
But I still get up in the mornin' though it's so hard all day long
If it weren't for the love of a woman, I don't think I'd continue on
And oh come the night time...

[Chorus]
Gettin' hungry
Hungry for my kind of woman
I'm gettin' hungry
Soon I gotta find me a woman
I'm gettin' hungry
Searchin' for a pretty girl

[Bridge]
I'm gettin' hungry
Hungry for my kind of woman

[Chorus]
Hungry, hungry for my kind of woman
I'm gettin' hungry
Soon I gotta find me a woman
I'm gettin' hungry
Searchin' for a pretty girl...

[Verse 1]
Did you get the tape I sent you
I thought it be better in a song
Better than the used condom you sent me
Baby that was wrong
All the things a brother had to picture
I see him doing things witcha
I see his hand in the small of your back
I see his face in between
The king and queen in fact

[Refrain]
Sometimes I want to die and come back as one of your tears

If I could just disappear
Ceace to exist
Ceace to be here
Want me
If you don't want me, I'm not worth the air that I breathe
I wish I could disappear

[Refrain]
Sometimes I want to die and come back as one of your tears
(Shoodebedotedoom)

[Interlude]
I'd dying

[Refrain]
Sometimes I want to die and come back as one of your tears
Sometimes I want to die and come back as one of your tears

[Chorus]
(Sweet, sweet, honey bee)
(Eat, eat it up, eat it up, honey)

[Verse 1]
Mama, I'm telling you
As sure as I am standing here
She's my girl, and that's the way
I'm keeping it, now mama dear

[Pre-Chorus]
No good will it do you
To stand there and frown at me
The girl's got my heart
And my love's comin' down on me
My love's comin' down since I
Got a taste of wild honey

[Chorus]
(Sweet, sweet, honey bee)
You know she's got the sweetness of a honey bee
(Eat, eat it up, eat it up, honey)
Wild honey
(Sweet, sweet, honey bee)
She got it on and stung me good, yes siree
(Eat, eat it up, eat it up, honey)

[Pre-Chorus]
With all the other stud bees
Buzzin' all around her hive
She singled me out
Single-handed took me alive
Can you dig I'm gonna take my life
Eatin' up her wild honey?

[Chorus]
(Sweet, sweet, honey bee)
(Eat, eat it up, eat it up, honey)
(Sweet, sweet, honey bee)
(Eat, eat it up, eat it up, honey)

[Bridge]
Oh mama, she's sweeter
(Sweeter)
And sweeter
(And sweeter)
Sweeter, sweeter (Mmm)
(Good, good, good)
Sweet wild honey

[Chorus]
(Sweet, sweet, honey bee)
Let me tell you how she really got to my soul
(Eat, eat it up, eat it up, honey)
It ain't funny
(Sweet, sweet, honey bee)
The way she makes me wanna sing a little rock and roll
(Eat, eat it up, eat it up, honey)

[Pre-Chorus]
There's nothing quite as sweet
As a kiss of wild honey
I break my back workin'
Just to save me some money
So I can spend my life with her
Sock it to me, wild honey

[Chorus/Outro]
(Sweet, sweet, honey bee)
Wild honey, she's mine
(Eat, eat it up, eat it up, honey)
Oh, wild honey, she's mine
(Sweet, sweet, honey bee)
(Eat, eat it up, eat it up, honey)
(Sweet, sweet, honey bee)
(Eat, eat it up, eat it up, honey)...

[Verse: Mike Love]
As I sit and close my eyes
There's peace in my mind
And I'm hoping that you'll find it too
And these feelings in my heart
I know, are meant for you

[Outro]
Meant for you

[Verse 1]
Today could be a lot of fun
And precious one
I'd feel good just to walk with you
Tonight will be a special treat

You say that you been a long time needing me
And don't you know that there's so much more to come

[Chorus]

[me and you]
And I say aren't you glad now tell me you're so glad

[Bridge]
(Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo)

Today is another day
Another way to get this feeling across to you
Tonight will be another night
That's outta sight cause I know the way to get close to you
You know that I'll be a long time loving you
I hope that you'll be a long time loving me
And don't you know that there's so much more to come

[Chorus]

And I say aren't you glad now tell me you're so glad

[Me and you]

[Chorus]
We've been friends now for so many years
We've been together through the good times and the tears
Turned each other on to the good things that life has to give

[Verse]
We drift apart for a little bit of a spell
One night I get a call and I know that you're well
And days I was down you would help me get out of my hole
Let's be friends
Let's be friends

You told me when my girl was untrue
I loaned you money when the funds weren't too cool
I talked your folks out of making you cut off your hair

[Chorus]
We've been friends now for so many years
We've been together through the good times and the tears

[Verse]
Full sail full sail
Steady as you go
The wind will blow
Set sail at Frisco Bay
In a fog cold and gray
Clear sailing, day after day
Full sail full sail
Now the air is still
We lay adrift
Come upon a sea of trouble
Till the winds of change shift
My course is set
There's no turning back
But there's no going anywhere yet
Full sail full sail
Waiting for the wind to blow
The wind will blow
Does the silence of the sea
Sound warning of a storm ahead
Whispers of the breeze
Stir and disappear
To soft to hear
What's in store for me

[Bridge]
Adventure on the high seas
Put the childhood dream to the test
Find the measure of the man
Follow the sun heading west

[Outro]
Full sail
Steady as you go
Steady as you go
Full sail
Waiting for the wind to blow
The wind will blow
Hey full sail
Mmmm mmmmm
Hey full sail

[Verse 1]
(Hey hey yes I was made to love her)
I was born in Little Rock
Had a childhood sweetheart
We were always hand in han-an-an-an-and
I wore high-top shoes and shirt-tails
Suzy was in pigtails
I knew I loved her even then
(Hey hey yes I was made to love her)
Don't you know my Papa dis'proved
My Mama hooo-ooo-hoooed it
But I told them time and time again

[Chorus]
(Hey hey yes I was made to love her)
Don't you know I was made to love her
Built my world all around her
Hey hey hey

[Verse 2]
(Hey hey yes I was made to love her)
She's been my inspiration
Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years
(Hey hey yes I was made to love her)
Like a sweet magnolia tree
My love blossomed tenderly
My life grows sweeter through the years
(Hey hey yes I was made to love her)
I know that my baby loves me
My baby needs me
That's why we made it through the years

[Chorus]
(Hey hey yes I was made to love her)
I was made to love her
Worship and adore her
Hey hey hey

[Verse 3]
(Hey hey yes I was made to love her)
My little baby loves me
My baby needs me
And I know I ain't going nowhere
I was knee-high to a chimp
And the love bug bit me
And I have to be with her a thousand years
(Hey hey yes I was made to love her)
If the mountain tumbles
If this whole world crumbles
I know I'll still be standing there

[Chorus]
(Hey hey yes I was made to love her)
Cause I was made to love her
I was made to live for her
Hey hey hey

[Outro]
(Hey hey yes I was made to love her)
One by one the stars appear
The light of the day is no longer here

One by one the stars disappear
The sky grows brighter
Every minute of the sunrise

Wake the world with a brand new morning
Say hello to another fine morning
Got my face in the running water
Making my life so much brighter

Moon shines bright, asleep in my bed
Like so many people
Got a big day ahead of me

Wake the world with a brand new morning
Say hello to another fine morning
Wouldn't miss it for all of its glory
I'll be there when you're calling me
One by one the stars appear
The light of the day
Is no longer here

[Verse 1]
It's been such a long day so you better hurry home
Lit all my incense and I wish you were home
Only five minutes and you walk through my door

[Pre-Chorus]
Be here in the morning
Be here in the evening
Be here and make my life full

[Chorus]
Be here in the morning
Be here in the evening
Be here and make my life

[Verse 2]
Stay here on the weekend and unplug the phone
(Alright then)
No calls from Korthoff, Parks, or Grillo
I only hope that you come here alone

[Pre-Chorus]
Be here in the morning
Be here in the evening
Be here and make my life full

[Chorus]
Be here in the morning
Be here in the evening
Be here and make my life

Be here in the morning
Be here in the evening
Be here and make my life

[Verse 1]
You know it makes you nervous
When you wait for your boy
You wait nine months for a bundle of joy
There's a baby
Yes, there's a baby about to be born
And someday I'll put my son on my knee
And his little eyes will be looking at me
Then I'll tell him

[Chorus]

[x2]
When a man needs a woman
They make things like you, my son

[Verse 2]
A man needs a woman
Like a woman needs a man
When the two get together
Oh oh, ho ho ho ho!
Pretty soon we'll be a family of three
Then it's not going to be just you and me
We'll share all the goodies
With the one we bring in the world

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
It's automatic when I
Talk with old friends
The conversation
Turns to girls we knew
When their hair was soft and long
And the beach was the place to go

[Verse 2]
With suntanned bodies
And waves of sunshine
The California girls
And a beautiful coastline
And warmed-up weather
Let's get together and do it again

[Chorus]
Do-do-do, do-do-do
Do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do
Do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do
Dum-dee-doo-ron
Do-do-do, do-do-do
Do, do-do-do-do

[Bridge]
With a girl, the lonely sea looks good
With moonlight
Makes your night times warm
And out of sight (Been so long)

[Interlude]
Do, do, do-do-do (Been so long)
Do, do, do-do-do (So long, been so long)
Been so long
Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now
Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now
Hey now, hey now, hey now, hey now

[Verse 3]
Well I've been thinking
'Bout all the places
We've surfed and danced
And all the faces
We've missed, so let's get
Back together and do it again
(Come on and do it)

[Outro]
Do-do-do, do-do-do
Do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do
Do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do
Dum-dee-doo-ron
Do-do-do, do-do-do
Do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do
Do, do-do-do-do…

[Verse]
Everyone's riding on the rolling tide
Their hearts are heavy and the sea is wide
I'll never make it to the other side, friends of mine

[Chorus]
Oh, I long to feel your arms around me
Oh, I long to feel your arms around me
Oh, my love, oh, my love

[Intro]
Ahhhhhh oooooo

[Verse 1]
This is the way
I always dreamed it would be
The way that it is, oh oh
When you are holding me
I never had a love of my own
Maybe that's why when we're all alone

[Chorus]
I can hear music
I can hear music
The sound of the city baby seems to disappear
I can hear music
Sweet sweet music
Whenever you touch me baby
Whenever you're near

[Verse 2]
Loving you
It keeps me satisfied
And I can't explain, oh no
The way I'm feeling inside
You look at me we kiss and then
I close my eyes and here it comes again

[Chorus]
I can hear music
I can hear music
The sound of the city baby seems to disappear
I can hear music
Sweet sweet music
Whenever you touch me baby
Whenever you're near

[Verse 3]
I hear the music all the time, yeah
I hear the music, hold me tight now baby
I hear the music all the time
I hear the music
I hear the music (baby)

Ahhhhh

[Chorus]
I can hear music
I can hear music
The sound of the city baby seems to disappear
I can hear music

[Chorus ]
Bluebirds over the mountain
Seagulls over the sea-ea-ea
Bluebirds over the mountain
Bring my baby to me

[Verse 1]
A boy and a girl they once found love
To each it seemed like heaven above
He looked into her eyes and said
Ooo wee baby you're so good for my head

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Oh everyone in every land
Please give me a helping hand
If you see her all alone
Oh tell my baby "won't you please come home?"

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Oh bring my baby back
I don't know why she's been so long
But all I know is that she's gone
Oh bring my baby back to me
Well I'm in pain can't you see
A boy and a girl they once found love
To each it seemed like heaven above
I guess that's why we fell in love
And now she's gone and all I have to say is

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Bring my baby
Oooo Baby
Oooo oooo oooo oooo

[Chorus]
Anna Lee, Anna Lee, the healer
Healer with the healin' hands
Makes you well as quick as she can
You'd love to see those smilin' eyes

From a Himalayan mountainside
Up in Rishikesh
To a California beach house
Facin' towards the sea
Goes a gal who got her fame
By goin' 'round a-healin' folks

[Chorus]
Anna Lee, Anna Lee, the healer
Healer with the healin' hands
Makes you well as quick as she can
You'd love to feel those healin' hands

If you trust her with your ill, she'll quickly make you see
She can fix things up for you just like she did for me

[Outro]
Anna Lee, Anna Lee, the healer
She cures people with her hands
I'm just one of her many fans
You'd love to feel those healin' hands
Of Anna Lee
The healer, the healer, the healer, the healer

[Verse 1]
You're going out tonight
You put your real cool-looking clothes on
You're getting uptight
About some little thing I said
All that I said
"I couldn't play the game"
It shouldn't make any
Difference to you

[Verse 2]
Go walking around, now
The wind's really blowing
It's too cold to talk
I wonder if she's knowing?
She should be with me
It could set her free
Come with me, be with me
A part of me

[Chorus]
Free (Ba ba ba ba)
(Ba ba ba ba ba, ba)
Free (Ba ba ba ba)
(Ba ba ba ba ba)
Everything we will see
Everything we will be
We will be

[Verse 3]
A new child is born
The mother is still waiting
Father's over there
Anticipating
Won't you be with me?
It could set us free
Come with me, be with me
A part of me

[Chorus]
Free (Ba ba ba ba)
(Ba ba ba ba ba)
Free (Ba ba ba ba)
(Ba ba ba ba ba)

[Outro]

You haven't got time for diamonds
And you pay no mind to gold
You gave up everything you had
But there's one thing I want you to hold

[Verse 1]
Come let the power through you
Come on and let me thrill you
Mama now

[Chorus]
(Baby come on come on)
Come on baby
(Baby come on come on)
Come on baby
I just want to do it with you

Well I don't care where you want to go
Just so you go with me
And I don't care what you want to do
But make sure you do it with me
All I want to do with you
Well I just make-a some love to you

[Chorus] 

[x2]
Come on baby
(Baby come on come on)
Come on baby
(Baby come on come on)
I said baby
(Baby come on come on)
I just want to do it to you
All night lo-ong

[Verse 1]
Little bird up in a tree
Looked down and sang a song to me
Of how it began

[Refrain]
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na

[Verse 2]
The trout in the shiny brook
Gave a worm another look
And told me not to worry
About my life

[Refrain]
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na

[Verse 3]
The tree in my own backyard
Stands all alone, bears fruit for me
And it tastes so good

[Bridge]
Where's my pretty bird?
He must have flown away
If I keep singing
He'll come back someday

[Verse 4]
At dawn, the bird's still gone
Guess I'll go mow the lawn
What a day, what a day
Oh, what a beautiful day this is

[Verse 5]
Little bird up in a tree
Looked down and sang a song to me
The trout in the shiny brook
Gave a worm another look
And told me not to worry about my life

[Outro]
A little bird looked down
And sang a song-ah! To me!
A little bird looked down
And sang a song-ah! To me!
A little bird looked down
And sang a song-ah! To me!

[Chorus]
You know, you know you are
Be still and know you are

[Verse]
Your life is meant for joy
It's all so deep within, oh
Your life is beautiful
A seed becomes a tree
A mountain into a sky
This life is meant to be, oh
Now is the time, life begins
Take that simple path
And love will set you free
Live in harmony
And love will set you free, oh

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Intro]
When I was a little bitty baby
My mama done rock me in the cradle
In them old cotton fields back home
It was back in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them old cotton fields back home

[Verse 1]
Let me tell you now well got me in a fix
I caught a nail in my tire doing lickity splits
I had to walk a long long way to town
Came upon a nice old man well he had a hat on
Wait a minute mister can you give me some directions
I going to want to be right off for home

[Verse 2]
Don't care if them cotton balls get rotten
When I got you baby, who needs cotton
In them old cotton fields back home
Brother only one thing more that's going to warm you
A summer's day out in California
It's going to be those cotton fields back home

[Verse 3]
It was back in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
Give me them cotton fields
(It was back in Louisiana)
Let me hear it for the cotton fields
(Just about a mile from Texarkana)
You know that there's just no place like home

[Outro]
Well boy it sure feels good to breathe the air back home
You should have seen their faces when they seen how I grown
In them old cotton fields back home

[Intro]
I took a walk and sat down in a park
The gardener walked out and the sprinklers went on
They watered the lawn and I went to sleep

[Verse]
Ten thirty I turned my radio on
Some group was playing a musical song
It wasn't too long and I went to sleep

[Outro]
Again at the park on a nice summer day
High up above me the trees gently sway
A bird flew away and I went to sleep

[Verse 1]
I had to fix a lot of things this morning
Because they were so scrambled
But now it's okay
I tell you I've got enough to do
The afternoon was filled up with phone calls
What a hot sticky day
Yeah, yeah, yeah
The air is cooling down

[Chorus 1]
Take all the time you need, it's a lovely night
If you decide to come, you're going to do it right
Drive for a couple miles, you see a sign and turn
Left for a couple blocks, next is mine you'll turn
Left on a little road, it's a bumpy one
You see a white fence, move the gate and drive
Through on the left side, come right in and you'll
Find me in my house somewhere
Keeping busy while I wait

[Verse 2]
I get a lot of thoughts in the morning
I write them all down
If it wasn't for that
I'd forget them in a while
And lately I've been thinking about a good friend
I'd like to see more of
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I think I'll make a call

[Chorus 2]
I wrote a number down but I lost it
So I searched through my pocket book, I couldn't find it
So I sat and concentrated on the number and
Slowly it came to me so I dialed it
And I let it ring a few times, there was no answer

[Outro]
So I let it ring a little more, still no answer
So I hung up the telephone, got some paper and
Sharpened up a pencil and
Wrote a letter to my friend

[Intro]
I looked at you baby
And what did I see
I saw love in your eyes
Made me feel so warm inside

[Verse 1]
Now look at me baby
And what do you see
You see love in my eyes
Gleaming just for you

[Pre-Chorus]
And now we know it's
Time to get alone
To get alone
And just be together
We'll only be together

[Chorus]
Come and do a couple days
Just a ways
Away from the people
And safe from the people

[Verse 2]
The pine-scented air
Smells so good in the snow
In our toboggan we'll go
Screaming down the mountainside
The touch of your cheeks
When they're rosy and cold
Feels so cozy to hold
Just to take you close
And make you warm and

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Lying down on our backs
Looking at the sky
Looking down through the valley so
Deep and wide
Aren't you glad we finally got away
Glad we finally got away
Aren't you glad we finally got away
Now I looked around baby
And what do I see
I see love in your eyes
And I'm so glad that we
Finally had some

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Chorus 1]
Transcendental meditation
Can emancipate the man
And get you feeling grand

[Verse]
Fusion of the never changing wind
The ever changing wind
The never changing world

[Chorus 2]
It's good

[x3]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 1]
Cease to resist, come on say you love me
Give up your world, come on and be with me
I'm your kind, I'm your kind, and I see
Come on, come on, ooh, I love you, pretty girl
My life is yours, and you can have my world
I'm your kind, I'm your kind, and I see

[Chorus]
Never had a lesson I ever learned
I know I could never learn not to love you
Come in, now closer
Come in, closer, closer, closer, ahhhh

[Verse 2]
Submission is a gift, give it to your lover
Love and understanding is for one another
I'm your kind, I'm your kind, and I see

[Chorus]
Never had a lesson I ever learned
I know I could never learn not to love you
Come in, now closer
Come in, closer, closer, closer, ahhhh

[Outro]
Ahhh-ahhh-ahhh-ahhh-ahhhhhh
Ahhh-ahhh-ahhh-ahhh-ahhhhhh

[Verse 1]
Lots of people with no place to go
I know a place where you can go
You've got the ticket, come on slip inside
And let my song take you for a ride

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on won't you let me be
By your side from now and eternity
Because I love you, baby I do

[Chorus]
And now can't you see what has come over me
Oh, my life is growing like a big oak tree
Because I love you, baby I do
And now can't you see

[Verse 2]
Why don't you come and let me kiss and make it better
I'm not the one who come and left it later
Now you relax and let your mind go free
You won't regret the feeling you receive

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on won't you let me be
By your side from now and eternity
'Cause I love you, baby I do

[Chorus]
And now can't you see what has come over me
Oh, my life is growing like a big oak tree
'Cause I love you, baby I do
And now can't you see

[Bridge]
My love is growing
Your heart is knowing
Our love is growing

[Outro]
Mama, oh can't you see
What has come over me
For my life
Oh, baby

[Verse 1]
Fun times in Babylon
That's what I'm counting on
Before the dam goes up at the foot of the sea
Before the New Wing of the Prison Ribbon Ceremony
Before the Star of the Morning comes looking for me

[Chorus]
I would like to abuse my lungs
Smoke everything in sight with every girl I've ever loved
Ride around the wreckage on a horse knee-deep in blood
Look out, Hollywood, here I come

[Verse 2]
Fun times in Babylon
Mama, they've just begun
Before they put me to work in a government camp
Before they do my face up like a corpse and say "get up and dance"
Before the Beast comes looking for last year's rent

[Chorus]
I would like to abuse my lungs
Smoke everything in sight with every girl I've ever loved
Ride around my wreckage on a horse knee-deep in blood
Look out, Hollywood, here I come
Look out, Hollywood, here I come
Look out, Hollywood, here I come

[Verse 1]
I ran down the road, pants down to my knees
Screaming "please come help me
That Canadian shaman gave a little too much to me!"
And I'm writing a novel
Because it's never been done before
First house that I saw, I wrote house up on the door
And told the people who lived there they had to get out
"'Cause my reality is realer than yours"
And there's no time in the present
And there's a black dog on the bed
I went to the backyard to burn my only clothes
And the dog ran out and said, "You can't turn nothing
Into nothingness with me no more"
Well, I'm no doctor, but that monkey might be right
And if he is, I'll be walking him my whole life

[Verse 2]
I rode to Malibu on a dune buggy with Neil
He said, "You're gonna have to drown me down on the beach
If you ever want to write the real"
And I said, "I'm sorry
"Young man, what was your name again?"
Now everywhere I go in West Hollywood
Is filled with people pretending they don't see the actress
And the actress wishing that they could
We could do ayahuasca
Baby, if I wasn't holding all these drinks
Something 'bout the way Violet whips her hair
That makes me empty my pockets
Holding court on the corner
Burning twenties as if I was the mayor
Well I don't need any new friends, Mama
But I could really use something to do
So if you're up for it sometime
I swear you wouldn't have to be my muse

[Outro]
Heidegger and Sartre, drinking poppy tea
I could've sworn last night I passed out in my van
And now these guys are pouring one for me
I never leave the canyon 'cause I'm surrounded on all sides
By people writing novels and living on amusement rides

[Verse]
I'm thinking about this whole world
Late at night I think about
The love of this whole world
Lots of different people everywhere
And when I go anywhere
I see love, I see love, I see love

When girls get mad at boys and go
Many times they're just putting on a show
But when they leave, you wait alone
You are there like everywhere
Like everyone you see
Happy, because you're living and you're free

[Bridge]
Now, here comes another day for your love
(I'm thinking about this whole world)
(This whole world)
Love

[Outro]
Late at night I think about
The love of this whole world

[Verse 1]
If you see a flaming sword in your dreams at night
And feel inspired to assign me up to the front line
Well, give the order, you'll storm the border without me
If they tell you you're a genius, but you need some proof
Ask anybody on the payroll to go out with you
If they avoid ya, then they'll award ya, definitely

[Verse 2]
Nobody that's around you seems to get it right
How hard is it to follow just a few guidelines
And smile while you do it?
If you want a page written 'bout you in the book
But you need a food tester 'cause you cursed the cook
I'll take some wine, but you can dine without me

[Verse 3]
Without me who would let you play God
And make believe that all the blasphemy
Was coming only from me? Oh
If you're bound for the throne, but the King won't die
I can occupy the Queen, but that's for her and I
I can do her and you'll be ruler without me

[Outro]
Yeah, you can do it
But you can do it without me

[Verse 1]
Try not to think so much about
The truly staggering amount of oil that it takes to make a record
All the shipping, the vinyl, the cellophane lining, the high gloss
The tape and the gear

[Verse 2]
Try not to become too consumed
With what's a criminal volume of oil that it takes to paint a portrait
The acrylic, the varnish, aluminum tubes filled with latex
The solvents and dye

[Chorus]
Let's just call this what it is
The gentler side of mankind's death wish
When it's my time to go
Gonna leave behind things that won't decompose

[Verse 3]
Try not to dwell so much upon
How it won't be so very long from now that they laugh at us for selling
A bunch of 15-year-olds made from dinosaur bones singing 'oh yeah'
Again and again
Right up to the end

[Chorus]
Let's just call this what it is
The gentler side of mankind's death wish
When it's my time to go
Gonna leave behind things that won't decompose

[Outro]
I'll just call this what it is
My vanity gone wild with my crisis
One day this all will repeat
I sure hope they make something useful out of me

[Verse 1]
Well, you took me to the movies, you took me to the dance
You took me to your warehouse tied up in the back of your van
You said, "whip it out," and I started to shout
"I'm in love with a woman again!"
Well, you took me to your office, we went to meet your folks
We went out to the garden shed where you took off all my clothes
And I was terrified by the look in your eyes
But there's a lot to loving I don't know
Well, you took me to the ceremony to sweat out all my fear
Came across a cosmic serpent with hands woven into his hair
If he's my spirit guide, I'm gonna stay inside
I'm never sleeping in a teepee again

[Refrain]
No no, no no no no no!
(Scatting)

[Verse 2]
Well, you asked me where I came from in the middle of round ten
I thanked you for the compliment before you clarified what you meant
You said, "What the hell are you doing here?
There's a prowler in my apartment"
Trout Fishing in America made me go and buy a pole
But by the time I got around to reading the book
I was a celebrated deep sea pro
Was drinking greyhounds way below the ground
On my very own TV show
Well, we went to get some work done, so our faces finally matched
The doctor took one look at me and took a skin graft out of my ass
If this is what it takes to take you on a date
I'm gonna put my member behind glass
If I make it out alive of Hollywood and Vine
I'll build a cabin up in the Northwest

[Refrain]
No no, no no no no no!
(Scatting)

[Chorus]
Every man needs a companion
Someone to turn his thoughts to
I know I do
Every man needs a companion
Someone to console him
Like I need you

[Verse 1]
John the Baptist took Jesus Christ
Down to the river on a Friday night
They talked about Mary like a couple of boys
With nothing to lose
Too scared to try

[Chorus]
Every man needs a companion
Someone to turn his thoughts to
I know I do
Every man needs a companion
Someone to console him
Like I need you

[Verse 2]
Joseph Campbell and The Rolling Stones
Couldn't give me a myth
So I had to write my own
I got hung up on religion
Though I know it's a waste
I never liked the name "Joshua"
And I got tired of "J."

[Outro]
Every man needs a companion
Someone to console him
Like I need you

[Verse 1 - Mike Love]
The Sunday morning gospel goes good with the soul
There's blues, folk, and country, and rock like a rolling stone
The world could come together as one
If everybody under the sun

[Chorus - All Group]
Add some music to your day
(Add some music add some add some music to your day)
A bob didit a bop didit

[Verse 2 - Mike Love]
You'll hear it while you're walking by a neighbor's home
You'll hear it faintly in the distance when you're on the phone
You're sitting in a dentist's chair
And they've got music for you there, to

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - All Group and Bruce Johnston]
Add some music, music everywhere (add some music)
Add some, add some, add some, add some music (add some music)
Your doctor knows it keeps you calm
Your preacher adds it to his psalms, so

[Chorus]

[Bridge - All Group and Carl Wilson]
Music
(Add some music, add some music)
When you're alone
(Add some music, add some music)
Is like a companion
(Add some music, add some music)
For your lonely soul
Oo oo oo woo oo woo oo oo oo oooo

[Verse 4 - Brian Wilson, Al Jardine, Bruce Johnston, Mike Love]
When day is over
I close my tired eyes
Music is in my soul
At a movie you can feel it touching your heart
And on every day of the summertime
You'll hear children chasing ice cream carts
They'll play it on your wedding day
There must be about a million ways to

[Chorus]

[Outro - All Group]
Add some music to your day

[x5]

[Verse 1]
I just met a woman on my way home, she just blew my mind
My heart was pumping, I mean all the way home
Got to know the woman
Whoa, I got to know the woman
I love the way you move
You make, make me feel like a man
(You know you make me, make me feel like a man)
Love the way you're looking
You look like you like it, too
(You know you look like you like it, too)

[Chorus]

[x7]
Got to know the woman
(Mama, mama, mama, mama, oom mow mow)

[Verse 2]
If you feel the feel I feel, you dig the feel of me
(You know you look like you dig feeling me)
Love the way you feel, dear
Ah, you make a, make a man out of me
(You make, you make a man out of me)
Come on, come on, come on and do the chicken

[Bridge]
I mean
Baby, I'm going to tell you something right now
You got so much soul you blow my mind
Oh baby, there's just one thing I want to say

[Chorus]

[x9]
Everyone's in love with you
But you can't fall in love with anyone
Still everyone's in love with you
Though you can't fall in love with only one

So many people have had a love affair
Have had a love to share like mine
But I tell you people, I found something new
A love of a different kind

Everyone's in love with you
Though most just barely glimpse a part of you
They all can see your love shine through
It comes from deep within the heart of you

So many people have had their love affairs
Had their loves to share like mine
Now I tell you people I witnessed something new
A love that could only be divine

Everyone's in love with you
And though you can't belong to only one
Still everyone's in love with you
Because (because) you gave your love
(Because) Because you gave your love (you gave your love)
Because you gave your love to everyone

[Verse 1]
This car of mine
A-win I got (bought) her now she wasn't new
Old and broke down
This car of mine
There's been a lot of races we been through
No slow poke now
I never want to part with her you see
This little car means a heck of a lot to me

[Chorus]
(This car of mine, oooooo)

[Verse 2]
I remember the day
A-when I chose her over all those old broken junkers
Thought I could tell
Underneath a coat of rust she was gold
No clunker
Just couldn't wait to take her home with me
And fix her up just as new as she could be

[Chorus]

[x3]

[Bridge]
Ain't no amount of gold any mine
Would be enough to take away this car of mine

[Outro]
(This car of mine, dit til lee hup hup)
This car of mine
(Dit til lee hup hup dit til lee hup hup)
Oh his car of mine
(Dit til lee hup hup dit til lee hup hup)
She's so so fine now
(Dit til lee hup hup dit til lee hup hup)
This car, this car so fine now
(Dit til lee hup hup dit til lee hup hup)
Mmm she's so fine...

[Intro]
Deirdre

[Verse 1]
The trouble you had
It wasn't so bad
It's only life and what you're living for
Sit down right here
I'll send away your tears
Well we don't have to talk about it much more

[Hook]
Good things turn bad but it's over now
So don't look sad because you're older now
Lots of people miss Deirdre

[Verse 2]
You're back again
You still have all your friends
And they used to ask me why'd you go away, Deirdre
What could I say
That you ran away
Don't you think it's time that you stayed right near me

[Hook]
These nights, pretty nights, that were meant to be
With you and me
It's the way that we
Always had our love, Deirdre

[Bridge]
I love your red hair
Deirdre da-da-ra-ra-ra-ra
Deir-Deir-Deir-Deirdre
I'm glad you're home again

Ooh hoo
Ooh hoo
Baby 1, 2, 3 and you're back with me

[Verse 3]
Tomorrow at ten
I'll wake you and then
We'll take a bath and then I'll laugh again with Deirdre

[Hook]
You may not live with me every day
All that I care is that we find a way
To stay together with Deirdre
Deirdre da-da-ra-ra-ra-ra
Deir-Deir-Deir-Deirdre

[Intro]
Doom Bopa Doom Bopa Doom Bopa Doo Dut
Ooh wah ooh wah ooh wah

Why do fools fall in love
Why do birds sing so gay
Love is awake at the break of day
Why do they fall in love
Why does the rain fall from up above
Why do fools fall in love
Why do they fall in love
Why does my heart skip with a crazy beat
'Fore I know it will face defeat
Tell my why why
Why do they fall in love
Why do fools fall in love
Doom Bopa Doom Bopa Doom Bopa Doo Dut
Why do birds sing so gay
Love is awake at the break of day

Tell my why why
Why do they fall in love
Tell my why why
Why do they fall in love

[Chorus]
Rah rah pom pom play girl
Pom pom play girl

[Verse 1]
(Oooooo)
You see her in a short skirt down on the grass
She's wondering if the team's going to run kick or pass
(Chi chi bah oooooo)
Since she doesn't really know why she's waving her hands
She's a-thinking 'bout the boy sitting up in the stands

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
(Chi chi bah)
Just a little social clique with the other song queens
With a freshman or a sophomore she wouldn't be seen
(Chi chi bah oooooo)
She's a doll and she knows it and she thinks that her face
Will get her any body any thing and any place

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Chi chi bah (Oooooo)
Since she's the head cheerleader she dates the quarterback
And her best friend's going out with the full back
(Chi chi bah oooooo)
She might even run for an office this Spring
And that ought to really make her telephone ring

[Chorus]

[Outro]
(Chi chi bah pom pom play girl)
Wooooo
(Chi chi bah pom pom play girl)
Wooo
(Chi chi bah pom pom play girl)
Shake it

[Chorus]
Keep an eye on Summer this year
Keep an eye on Summer
Keep an eye on

[Bridge]
We said goodbye last September
Your words I still can hear

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Those things I say in my letters
You'll find them most sincere
Keep an eye on Summer this year-ear-ear
Soon we'll be graduating
And we'll be so far apart
And though you could be dating
I'm waiting and waiting
And as we look at the future
Though it be through a tear

[Chorus]

[x3]

[Verse 1 - Brian Wilson, Al Jardine]
I do them when I'm down in the tub
With avocado cream they'll take a rub
They wrinkle like a-raisins if I stay too long
I wouldn't want to do it wrong
They'll put you in the driver's seat
And to the table when you want to eat
But when you go to sit down in your chair
Something else has got to put you there

[Chorus]
Take good care of your feet, Pete
You better watch out what you eat, Pete
Better take care of your life
Because nobody else will

[Verse 2 - Al Jardine, Brian Wilson]
They'll twinkle when you fall in love
And put you there when you jump up above
When you're on the spot, get them right under you
One, then the other too
If you want to do the right thing for them
Just take a walk in the grass
But don't you catch yourself falling
Or stepping on a piece of glass
(Ouch glass)
Pete knows all the treacherous blows
The fallen arches and the cramp in the toes
He went to H. E. L. P. and got some sandals new
And dusty old saunas too

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Do do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do do

It won't be long
(Duh duh)
Until I see my love
(Duh duh)
I'll take her in
(Duh duh)
My arms again
(Duh duh)
I'll tell her I
(Duh duh)
Will never leave again
I said Louie Louie
(Duh duh)
(Duh duh duh)
(Duh duh)
Well me got to go
(Duh duh)
(Duh duh duh)
(Duh duh)
Louie Louie
(Duh duh)
(Duh duh duh)
(Duh duh)
Yeah me got to go
(Duh duh)
(Duh duh duh)
(Duh duh)
I say me got to go now
(Duh duh)
(Duh duh duh)
(Duh duh)
Me got to go

[Chorus]
Don't go near the water
Don't you think it's sad
What's happened to the water
Our water's going bad

[Verse 1]
Oceans, rivers, lakes and streams
Have all been touched by man
The poison floating out to sea
Now threatens life on land

[Chorus]
Don't go near the water
Ain't it sad
What's happened to the water
It's going bad

[Bridge]
Don't go near the water
Don't go near the water

[Verse 2]
Toothpaste and soap will make our oceans a bubble bath
So let's avoid an ecological aftermath
Beginning with me
Beginning with you

[Chorus]
Don't go near the water
To do it any wrong
To be cool with the water
Is the message of this song

[Outro]
Let's all help the water
Right away
Do what we can and ought to
Let's start today

[Verse 1]
So hard to answer future's riddle
When ahead is seeming so far behind
So hard to laugh a child-like giggle
When the tears start to torture my mind
So hard to shed the life of before
To let my soul automatically soar

[Chorus]
But I hit hard at the battle that's confronting me, yeah
Knock down all the roadblocks a-stumbling me
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down

[Verse 2]
Sew up the wounds of evolution
And the now starts to get in my way
So what if life's a revelation
If the mind speaks of only today
So real, the pain of growing in soul
Of climbing up to reality's goal

[Chorus]
But I hit hard at the battle that's confronting me, yeah
Knock down all the roadblocks a-stumbling me
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down

[Bridge]
Long promised road
Trail starts at dawn, carries on to the season's ending
Long promised road
Flows to the source, gentle force, never ending, never ending

[Verse 3]
So hard to lift the jeweled scepter
When the weight turns a smile to a frown
So hard to drink of passion nectar
When the taste of life's holding me down
So hard to plant the seed of reform
To set my sights on defeating the storm

[Chorus]
So I hit hard at the battle that's confronting me, yeah
Knock down all the roadblocks stumbling me
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down
Oh yeah

Hit hard at the battle that's confronting me, yeah
Knock down all the roadblocks stumbling me
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down, whoo yeah
Hit hard at the battle that's confronting me, yeah
Knock down all the roadblocks stumbling me, yeah
Throw off all the shackles that are binding me down

[Outro]
I'd love to see you
I'd love to see you
I'd love to see you
I'd love to see you

[Verse 1]
I used to be a famous artist
Proud as I could be
Struggling to express myself
For the whole world to see
I used to blow my mind sky high
Searching for the lost elation
Little did I know the joy I was to find
In knowing I am only me

[Chorus]
I'm singing in my heart
I'm singing in my heart
I'm singing, love to sing
I love to sing it from my heart

[Verse 2]
Oh, the creation yeah
Of a good time doing my part
With an open-hearted laugh
Of realization in my mind
And now I'm but a child who art
Erect in humility
Serving out a love for everyone I meet
In truth who are really me

[Chorus]
I'm singing in my heart
I'm singing in my heart
I'm singing, love to sing
I love to sing it down from my heart

[Bridge]
No, no, no, no, no, no
It's about time now
It's about time now
It's about time now
Don't you know now
It's about time now
It's about time now
It's about time now
Don't you know now
It's about time we get together
To be out front and love one another
Brothers, sisters, everybody
We better start to help each other now
We need it now

[Outro]
When we're sharing our love, brother
That's when we know we can shape another world
Oh no, Lord no no no no no no oh

[Chorus]
Tears in the morning
(I've got tears, I've got tears in the morning)
They ain't going to tell me what to do
No, no, those tears, I know they're just a warning
(Tears, I've got tears, I've got tears, are a warning)
Reminding me I'm missing you

[Verse 1]
So you moved out up to Europe
You packed your warmth and you took your soul
Well, I hope you do what you're damn sure of
A lonely bed here takes on the cold
Lose a wife, change my life, we're not together
A cancelled future, well, it's hard on me
Gone, you're gone, are you gone forever?
Hope you love the baby I'm never gonna see

[Chorus]
And I've got tears in the morning
(I've got tears, I've got tears in the morning)
They ain't going to tell me what to do
No, no, those tears, I know they're just a warning
(Tears, I've got tears, I've got tears, are a warning)
Reminding me I'm missing you

[Verse 2]
Well, you know I lit a candle
It's in my heart now where it glows
Day and night, feel my light, it's going to stand until
My heart believes in what you chose
I won't let nobody carry this load for me
Guess, I keep a hold on my sorrow
I've got to feel, now all that you see

[Chorus]
And I've got tears in the morning
(I've got tears, I've got tears in the morning)
They ain't going to tell me what to do
No, no, those tears, I know they're just my warning
(Tears, I've got tears, I've got tears, are a warning)
Reminding me I'm missing you
I've still got tears, tears in the morning
(I've got tears, I've got tears in the morning)
They ain't going to tell me what to do
No, no, those tears, I know they're just my warning
(Tears, I've got tears, I've got tears, are a warning)
Reminding me I'm missing you
I'm missing you

[Verse 1]
Birds fly up
And down spinning round
Flying all around
From my window
A little brown sparrow came
Fluttering down
"Le moineau est venu
Se poser à ma fenêtre"
He came to my window
And as I watched him
I found myself reeling and turning around
And the faster I ran
I ran out of breath and I fell to the ground
(Poof)

[Bridge]
He came to my window

[x3]

[Verse 2]
From their eyes
The people must look like miniature toys

[Outro]
Do do do do do

[x2]
Fly away

[x3]

[Verse 1]
Clearing skies and drying eyes
Now I see your smile
Darkness goes and softness shows
A changing style
Just in time words that rhyme
Well bless your soul
Now I'll fill your hands
With kisses and a Tootsie Roll

[Chorus]
Oh reality, it's not for me
And it makes me laugh
Oh, fantasy world and Disney girls
I'm coming back

[Verse 2]
Patti Page and summer days
On old Cape Cod
Happy times making wine
In my garage
Country shade and lemonade
Guess I'm slowing down
It's a turned back world
With a local girl
In a smaller town

[Chorus]
Open cars and clearer stars
That's what I've lacked, oh
But fantasy world and Disney girls
I'm coming back

[Bridge]
(Love) Hi Rick and Dave
Hi Pop, good morning, mom
(Love) Get up guess what
I'm in love with a girl I found
She's really swell
'Cause she likes
Church, bingo chances
And old-time dances

[Verse 3]
All my life I spent the night
With dreams of you
And the warmth I missed
And for the things I wished
They're all coming true
I've got my love to give
And a place to live
Guess I'm going to stay
It'd be a peaceful life
With a forever wife
And a kid someday

[Chorus]
Well, it's earlier nights
And pillow fights
And your soft laugh, oh
Fantasy world and Disney girls
I'm coming back

[Verse 1]
Unfolding, enveloping missiles of soul
Recall senses sadly
Mirage like soft blue, like lanterns below
To light the way gladly
Whether whistling heaven's clouds disappear
Whether wind withers memory
Whether whiteness whisks soft shadows away

[Chorus]
Feel flows (White puff, glistening, shadowy flow)
Feel goes (Black puff, glistening, shadowy glow)

[Verse 2]
Unbending, never-ending tablets of time
Record all the yearning
Unfearing, all-appearing message divine
Eases the burning
Whether willing witness waits at my mind
Whether hope dampens memory
Whether wondrous will stands tall at my side

[Chorus]
Feel flows (White puff, glistening, shadowy flow)
Feel goes (Black puff, glistening, shadowy glow)

[Verse 3]
Encasing, all-embracing wreath of repose
Engulfs all the senses
Imposing, unclosing thoughts that compose
Retire the fences
Whether wholly-heartened life fades away
Whether harps heal the memory
Whether wholly-heartened life fades away
Whether wondrous will stands tall at my side
Whether whiteness whisks soft shadows away

[Chorus]
Feel goes (White puff, glistening, shadowy flow)
Feel flows (Black puff, glistening, shadowy glow)
Feel goes (White puff, glistening, shadowy flow)
Feelings to grow (White puff, glistening, shadowy flow)

[Outro]
White puff, glistening, shadowy glow
White puff, glistening, shadowy glow
White puff, glistening, shadowy glow...

[Chorus]
All I wanna do
Is always bring good to you
To give you all the love I can
And help you in whatever you do

[Verse 1]
Sure as the sun will come around again
To start off another day
You can be sure that in my heart and soul
I'll love you in every way

[Chorus]
All I wanna do
Is bring happiness to you
I hope it makes you happy to know
My love’s with you wherever you go

[Verse 2]
Ooh, when I sit and close my eyes
A gentle thought comes in my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
My love is burning brightly (burning brightly)
Like moon and stars shine nightly

[Bridge]
All I wanna do…
All I wanna do…
All I wanna do…
All I wanna do…

[Verse 3]
Oh, let these little words of love
Come romance and light your way

[Pre-Chorus]
My love is burning brightly (burning brightly)
Like moon and stars shine nightly

[Outro]
All I wanna do…
All I wanna do…
All I wanna do…
(My love is burning brightly)
(Like moon and stars shine brightly)

[Verse 1]
If every word I said
Could make you laugh
I'd talk forever (Together, my love)
I ask the sky just what we had
It shone forever
If the song I sing to you
Could fill your heart with joy
I'd sing forever (Together, my love)

[Chorus]
Forever, forever
I've been so happy loving you
Together, my love

[Verse 2]
Let the love I have for you
Live in your heart
And beat forever (Together, my love)

[Chorus]
Forever, forever
I've been so happy loving you

[Bridge]
Baby, just let me sing it, my baby
I want to be singing, my baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, my baby
I want to be singing, my baby

[Outro]
So I'm going away
But not forever
I'm gonna love you in your way
Forever

[Verse 1]
I thought about a summer day
And how the time just floats away
Pretty things like incense and flowers
I want to make them part of

[Chorus]
Our sweet love could last forever

[x2]

[Verse 2]
I thought about a winter night
And how I'd like to hold you tight
Candlelight the warmth of a fire
We could make them part of

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Sweet love, sweet love
Like a child with his new toy
My heart is filled with joy for

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Lord knows I love her so
I feel it down inside my soul
A precious love like this can flower
There's nothing in this world like

[Chorus]

[x4]

[Verse]
I've been laying on my back
Like a freight train off a track
Trying to find a job to fit my trade

With the morning sun come around
Well I'll be covering plenty of ground
And I don't need nobody to pay my aid
Mmmm pay my aid

Now Bess and me were feeling bad
And all the good jobs they were had
I had to take to sweeping up some floors

Well I don't mind that so much
Or the changing of my luck
But you know I could be doing so much more

[Bridge]
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
Bip bip bip bip bip bip bip bip bip bip

[Outro]
Well I'll be coming home tonight
Everything will be all right
And we'll be looking at tomorrow

[Verse: Jack Rieley]
Feel the wind burn through my skin
The pain, the air is killing me
For years my limbs stretched to the sky
A nest for birds to sit and sing
But now my branches suffer
And my leaves don't bear the glow
They did so long ago
One day I was full of life
My sap was rich and I was strong
From seed to tree I grew so tall
Through wind and rain I could not fall
But now my branches suffer
And my leaves don't offer
Poetry to men of song

[Outro: Jack Rieley, Van Dyke Parks, Al Jardine]
Trees like me weren't meant to live
If all this world can give
Pollution and slow death
Oh Lord I lay me down
No life's left to be found
There's nothing left for me
Trees like me weren't meant to live
If all this earth can give
Is pollution
Trees like me weren't meant to live
(Oh Lord I lay me down)
If all this earth can give
(My branches to the ground)
Is pollution and slow death
(There's nothing left for me)
Oh Lord I lay me down
My branches to the ground
There's nothing left for me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Cooling, so cooling, cooling me

[x2]

[Chorus 1]

[x3]
Have some cool clear water
(Drink a little drip, drip, drip, drip, drink a little)
(Water cooling me)

[Pre-Chorus 1]

[Chorus 1]

[x3]

Water, water, water, water, water, water
Now, now, now, now, now

[x7]

[Pre-Chorus 1]

[Chorus 1]

[x3]

[Chorus 2]

[x2]
When the heat's got you down
Here's what you ought to
Get yourself in that cool, cool water
(Cooling so cool, cooling me)
Cool, cool water
Get yourself in that cool, cool water
(Cooling, so cool, cooling me)
Cool cool water

[Verse]
In an ocean or in a glass
Cool water is such a gas
Cooling, so cooling, cooling me
From the mountains on down to the sea
Cool water keeps on cooling me
When the nights are too hot to keep cool
I keep on dreaming about a swimming pool
When I'm just too hot to move
Cool, cool water is such a groove
In a shady spot when I'm laying down
Only thing moving are the ants on the ground

[Outro]
When I'm thirsty and I reach for a glass
Cool water tastes like such a gas
From the mountains on down to the sea
Cool, cool water keeps on cooling me

[x2]
Get yourself in that cool, cool water now
Cool, cool water keeps on cooling me

[x2]

[Chorus]
Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me

[x2]

[Verse 1]
I have no kicks against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darned fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until it sounds just like a symphony

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I took my loved one over across the tracks
So she could hear my man wailing sax
I must admit they have a rocking band
Man, they were blowing like a hurricane

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Way down south they gave a jubilee
I tell you folks they had a jamboree
And drinking beer from a wooden cup
The folks dancing got all shook up

[Chorus]

[Outro
Say, if you want to dance with me

[x3]
It's got to be some of that
If you wanna dance with me

[Verse 1]
I'm a cork on the ocean
Floating over the raging sea
How deep is the ocean?
How deep is the ocean?
I lost my way, hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2]
I'm a rock in a landslide
Rolling over the mountainside
How deep is the valley?
How deep is the valley?
It kills my soul, hey, hey, hey

[Verse 3]
I'm a leaf on a windy day
Pretty soon, I'll be blown away
How long will the wind blow?
How long will the wind blow?
Do-do, do-do-do-do-do-do, do-do
(Until I die) Until I die

[Chorus/Outro]
These things I'll be until I die
These things I'll be until I die
These things I'll be until I die
These things I'll be until I die
These things I'll be until I die
These things I'll be until I die
These things I'll be until I die
These things I'll be until I die
These things I'll be until I die...

[Verse 1]
I sailed an ocean, unsettled ocean
Through restful waters and deep commotion
Often frightened, unenlightened
Sail on, sail on sailor

[Verse 2]
I wrest the waters, fight Neptune's waters
Sail through the sorrows of life's marauders
Unrepenting, often empty
Sail on, sail on sailor

[Chorus]
Caught like a sewer rat, alone but I sail
Bought like a crust of bread, but oh do I wail
Seldom stumble, never crumble
Try to tumble, life's a rumble
Feel the stinging I've been given
Never ending, unrelenting
Heartbreak searing, always fearing
Never caring, persevering
Sail on, sail on, sailor

[Verse 3]
I work the seaways, the gale-swept seaways
Past shipwrecked daughters of wicked waters
Uninspired, drenched and tired
Wail on, wail on, sailor

[Chorus 2]
Always needing, even bleeding
Never feeding all my feelings
Damn the thunder, must I blunder
There's no wonder all I'm under
Stop the crying and the lying
And the sighing and my dying
Sail on, sail on sailor

[Outro]
Sail on, sail on sailor
Sail on, sail on sailor
Sail on, sail on sailor
Sail on, sail on sailor
Sail on, sail on sailor
Sail on, sail on sailor

[Verse 1]
Fun is in, it's no sin, it's that time again
To shed your load, hit the road on the run again
Summer skies in our eyes and a warmer sun
It's one for all, all for one, all for all out fun

[Chorus]
Got to go to it
Going to go through it
Got to get with it

[Verse 2]
Looking good
Down the hood Of a funky ride
On the way
To the tide
Just to tan your hide
In the shade
Lemonade
In the sun ocean spray
To get your face
In the race
Or lay back's no disgrace

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
It's OK to get out there and
Have some fun
By yourself maybe
Or else with a special one
Good or bad
Glad or sad
It's all going to pass
So it's OK
Let's all play
And enjoy it while it lasts

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Find a ride

[x11]
(In the sum-sum-summertime)

[x9]

[Verse]
Had to phone you
Had to phone you just to talk to you
Had to phone you just to tell you I was missing you
It lifts my spirits every single time
Sometimes you're busy for awhile
But when you get through
It makes me smile
When I phone you
California's not so far away
You're not alone, you know I'm only just a dial away
I visualize that you're looking fine
Feels so good when you come on the line

[Bridge]
You (you) you (you) you (you) you (you)

[x4]

[Chorus]

[x6]
Come on and answer the phone
Come on, come on
(I hope your home)

[Verse]
Cashmere hills filled with evergreens
Flowin' from the clouds down to meet the sea
With the granite cliff as a referee
Crimson sunsets and golden dawns
Mother deer with their newborn fawns
Under Big Sur skies and that's where I belong

[Chorus]
Big Sur I've got plans for you
Me and mine are going to
Add ourselves to your lengthy list of lovers

[Verse]
And live in canyons covered with a springtime green
While birds and flowers to be heard and seen
And on my old guitar I'll make up songs to sing
Sparklin' springs from the mountainside
Join the Big Sur river rushing to the tide
Where my kids can search for sea shells at low tide

[Chorus]
Big Sur, my astrology
It says that I am meant to be
Where the rugged mountain meets the water

[Verse]
And so while stars shine brightly and up above
Fog rolls in through a redwood grove
And to my dying fire I think I'll add a log

[Verse 1]
An eagle's nest on the head of an old redwood on one of the
Precipice-footed ridges above Ventana Creek
That jagged country which nothing but a fallen meteor will ever plow:
No horseman will ever ride there, and no hunter cross this ridge but the winged ones
No one will steal the eggs from this fortress
The she-eagle is old, her mate was shot long ago, she is now mated with a son of hers
When lightning blasted her nest she built it again on the same tree, in the splinters of the thunder bolt

In a broken shack an old man takes his time about dying
And just at the back a wild flowerbed that he'll lie in
In dawn's new light a man might venture
A horse drawn stage from Monterey

[Verse 2]
The she-eagle is older than I: she was here when the fires of eighty-five raged on these ridges
She was lately fledged and dared not hunt ahead of them, but ate scorched meat
The world has changed in her time; humanity has multiplied
But not here; men's hopes and thoughts and customs have changed, their powers are enlarged, their powers and their follies have become fantastic

Spilled down the hill a wagon load of bodies lay scattered, shipwrecked at sea
Limestone ore is all that mattered
They took it from the hills right through the cargo doors
How many ships have come and gone at Thurso's landing shore?

[Verse 3]
The unstable animal never has been changed so rapidly
The motor and the plane and the great war have gone over him
And Lenin has lived and Jehovah died: while the mother-eagle hunts the same hills, crying the same beautiful and lonely cry
And is never tired: dreams the same dreams
And hears at night the rock-slides rattle and thunder in the
Throats of these living mountains
It is good for man to try all changes, progress and corruption, powers, peace and anguish
Not to go down the dinosaur's way until all his capacities have been explored: and it is good for him
To know that his needs and nature are no more changed, in fact, in ten thousand years than the beaks of eagles

The eagle's plight, we know that nature's balance is undone
And it's the birthright of man to unify and live his life as one
A whisper of the word will let you soar with your soul

[Chorus 1]
Going to the chapel
And we're going to get married
Going to the chapel
And we're going to get married

[Chorus 2]
Gee, I really love you
And we're going to get married
Going to the chapel of love

[Verse 1]
Spring is here, the sky is blue
Birds all sing like they knew
Today's the day, we'll say, "I do"
And we'll never be lonely anymore

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 2]
Bells will ring, the sun will shine
I'll be hers and she'll be mine
We'll love until the end of time
And we'll never be lonely anymore

[Chorus 1]

[Intro - Brian Wilson]
On my way to sunny California
On my way to spend another sunny day

[Chorus]
Water, water
Get yourself in the cool, clear, water
The sun shines brightly down on Penny's place
(The sun shines brightly down on the bay)
The air's so clean it'll just take your mind away
(Take your mind away, take your mind away)

[Verse 1]
Have you ever been south of Monterey?
Barrancas carve the coast line
And the chaparral flows to the sea
'Neath waves of golden sunshine
And have you ever been north of Morro Bay?
The south coast plows the sea
And the people there are of the breed
They don't need electricity

[Chorus 2]
Water, water
Cool cascades of clear, clear water
The sun dance final scene sets the hills ablaze
(Get yourself in that water)
Horizon edges quick up the mountain's way
(Up the mountain's way, up the mountain's way)

[Verse 2]
Have you ever been down Salinas way
Where Steinbeck found the valley?
And he wrote about it the way it was in his travelin's with Charley
And have you ever walked down through the sycamores
Where the farmhouse used to be?
There, the monarch's autumn journey ends
On a windswept cyprus tree

[Chorus]
Water, water (Get, get yourself in that)
Get yourself in that cool, clear, water
(Get yourself in that, get yourself in that water)
The sun shines brightly down on Penny's place
(Get yourself in that water)
The air's so clean that it just takes your mind away
(Take your mind away, take your mind away)

[Verse 3]
Have you ever been to a festival
The Big Sur congregation?
Where Country Joe will do his show
And he'll sing about liberty
And the people there in the open air are one big family
Yeah, the people there love to sing and share
Their new found liberty

[Intro]
Hi
Trader

[Verse 1]
Trader sailed a jewelled crown
Humanity rowed the way
Exploring to command more land
Scheming how to rule the waves
Trader spied a virgin plain
And named it for velvet robes
Wrote home declaring, "There's a place
Where totally folks are free (happily completely)
Nourishment fills the prairies and the hillsides
And animals stalk the mountains and the seaside
And fish abound the lakes and birds the skies
Signed sincerely"

[Verse 2]
Trader found the jewelled land
Was occupied before he came
By humans of a second look
Who couldn't even write their names, shame
Trader said they're not as good
As folks who wear velvet robes
Wrote home again and asked, "Please help
Their breasts I see; they're not like me
Banish them from our prairies and our hillsides
Clear them from our mountains and our seaside
I want them off our lakes so please reply
Signed sincerely"

[Verse 3]
Trader, he got the crown okay
Cleared humanity from his way
He civilized all he saw
Making changes every single day, say
Shops sprang over the prairies and the hillsides
Then roads cut through the mountains to the seaside
The other kind fled to hide, by and by
And so sincerely cried

[Outro]
Making it softly
Like the evening sea, trying to be
Making it go
Creating it gently
Like a morning breeze, a life of ease
Eyes that see beyond tomorrow
Through to the time without hours
Passing the Eden of Flowers
Reason to live

Embracing together
Like the merging streams, crying dreams
Making it full
Begging intently
For a slight reprieve, a night of ease
Hands to touch beyond the sorrow
On to the force without power
Piercing the crust of the tower
Reason to live
Hoping
Like a budding rose, humbling shows
Making it
Struggling lonely
Like a desert field, break the seal, make it real
Ears to hear beyond the showers
On to the suns of tomorrows
Burning the flesh of all sorrows
Reason to live
Reason to continue
Reason to go on
Reason to live
Reason to live
Reason to live

[Verse]
I long to see you oh my love
I want to feel you near
My need is deep inside
Well I've been rolling on, I've been holding on, I'd like you to know
That it's been a long, long time

Sometimes it's hard to make it through the day
Sometimes it's hard to find my way
Sometimes it's hard to notice the changing days
When your friends have all gone
Leaving this town for another one

The night is coming round
I can feel the weight of coming down
So afraid to lose this dream
I want you to understand that I'm trying to do the best I can
It's so easy to lose my way

Sometimes it's hard to make it through the day
Sometimes it's hard to find my way
Sometimes it's hard to notice the changing days
When your friends have all gone
Leaving this town for another one
Lay your head where you may find some peace
I've been searching for my happiness
Don't you want to wake up find and take my love
I'd be happy if you'd let me know
Should I stay or go
Let me know

Woke from a dream to see reflections all around me, of new realities
Heavenly angels won't you guide me please help me to decide the path most meant for me

Sometimes it's hard to make it through the day
Sometimes it's hard to find my way
Sometimes it's hard to notice the changing days
When your friends have all gone
Leaving this town for another one

[Verse 1]
Well, back in time with just a rhythm and rhyme
Gregorian chants were a real big thing
They took that chant and added harmony
It was a different sound
But had the same meaning

[Pre-Chorus]
I know (I know) I know (I know)
It took us a long while
To go (to go) to go (to go)
And find us a rock style
I know (I know) I know (I know)
That we can take it one more mile

[Chorus]
Because
We're singing that same song
We're still singing that same song
We're singing that same song
That same song

[x2]

[Verse 2]
The rock of ages
Built that rocking sound
Until more and more people start to come around
They worshiped in church
And built that great big choir
It grew and it grew
Until it spread like fire

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Same song, oh yeah

[x4]

[Verse 1]
Love is so many things that I feel
I have only felt with you
Only with you

[Verse 2]
And then there are the things that we do
That I've only done with you
Only with you

[Bridge]
Before, love, it had always had its up and downs
Until the love I finally found

[Verse 3]
I know one thing for sure I wanna do
I wanna spend this life with you
Only with you

[Outro]
Yes, it's true
All I wanna do, ooh
Is spend my life with you, ooh
All I wanna do, ooh
Is spend my life with you, ooh
Yes, it's true, ooh
I wanna spend my life with you
All I wanna do, ooh
Is spend my life with you, ooh
All I wanna do, ooh
Is spend my life with you

[Verse]
What time is it?
How long has it been?
Bubbles and ripples floating through my mind
I must have drifted away
Since I sat down
Where have I been?
The mantra, my mantra must have took me away
It must have took me away
Maharishi gave it to me
And I wonder if it set me free
And it did
And he'll tell you
"sometimes it goes real fast
And other times it goes real slow
Any way you do it it's bound to work I know"
One, two, three, four

[Outro]
Transcendental meditation should be part of your time
It's simple, it's easy as making this rhyme
Transcendental meditation really works for me good
More, much more than I thought it would

[Verse 1]
A Pisces lady loves romance (She loves romance)
Her movements tell you at a glance (She loves to dance)
Why they say Pisces rules the dance (She's got the glance)
Whoa
She values flowers more than gold (She flows like gold)
Thinks of her men as knights of old (She's never bold)
She's very spiritual I'm told (She has never told)
Whoa

[Chorus 1]
But where's my spark in the dark?
Glow glow glow c'mon glow
The funky pretty flame in my heart
Me and my Pisces lady are apart

[Verse 2]
Her calendar is not like ours (She rules the hours)
The hieroglyphs mark changing hours (She rules the stars)
Her guiding light is from the stars (She's got the powers)
Whoa
A book of verse, a jug of wine (She's soft like wine)
She'll always tell what's on your mind (She's much like time)
By just your birthday, place and time (She's very fine)
Whoa

[Chorus 2]
'Cause it's a silent night in the sea
And if you're cosmically conscious, you'll see
Why she's a princess incarnate to me
Daughter of Neptune, the ruler of the sea

[Bridge]
The queen in Copenhag-ee (Funky pretty)
The dream of Amsterdam-ee (Pretty funky)
The cream of gay Paris-ee (Funky pretty)
The theme of U Say Ah-see (Pretty funky)
The scene in Great Britain-yee (Funky pretty)
The meaning in Los Ang-ees (Pretty funky)
The heat in Tokyo-see (Funky pretty)
The treat in Manhatt-oh-see (Pretty funky)
Yeah, yeah
Funky pretty

[Chorus 3]
She said "Don't worry, it's alright
I'm coming back when the aspects are right"
And now I look in the paper each day
Wondering what my horoscope will say

[Outro]
Funky (ooooh funky)
(Someone say why, someone say why)
I still remember funky pretty (oooooh)
(Why shouldn't my Pisces lady tell me why)
(Why can't you tell me why)

[Verse 1]
Susie Cincinnati
Got a groovy little motor car
She lives for the night
And her husband's a security guard
Her looks aren't exactly a plus
But it doesn't matter to us
Because she knows where it's at
And she gets you there in seconds flat

[Verse 2]
She knows all the honkies
And the kids are all home in bed
(Ooh, ride, Susie Cincinnati, ride)
She'd rather do this
Than anything else instead
(Ooh, ride, Susie Cincinnati)
She got the nicotine fit
And before she discovered it
Everybody in the back seat suffocated

[Chorus]
Susie Cincinnati, we thought you were a winner
(Whoa, come on, Susie! Wake yourself up)
But Susie Cincinnati, city's number one sinner
Susie Cincinnati, we thought you were a winner
But Susie Cincinnati, city's number one sinner
Susie Cincinnati, we thought you were a winner
(Get yourself together)
But Susie Cincinnati, city's number one sinner
Susie Cincinnati, we thought you were a winner
But Susie Cincinnati, city's number one sinner

[Verse 3]
She'll always pick you up
When the others go and let you down
(Ooh, ride, ooh, ride, Susie Cincinnati, ride)
In her little red cab
She's scooting all over town
(Ooh, ride, ooh, ride, Susie Cincinnati)
She's got a money meter too
All polished up, it shines for you
But it's just for looks
'Cause she'll give the ride free to you

[Outro]
Susie Cincinnati
Susie Cincinnati
Susie Cincinnati
S-S-Susie Cincinnati
S-S-Susie Cincinnati
S-S-Susie Cincinnati
S-S-S-Susie Cincinnati...

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I found my thrill
On blueberry hill
On blueberry hill
When I found you

[Chorus 1]
The moon stood still
(Moon stood still)
On blueberry hill
(Blueberry hill)
It lingered until
(Lingered until)
My dream came true

[Chorus 2]
Though we're apart
(We're apart)
I think of you still
(Think of you still)
For you were my thrill
(You were my thrill)
On blueberry hill

[Verse]
The wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows you made
Were never to be

[Chorus 2]

[Pre-Chorus 1]

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, I'm going back this summer to Ohio
I'm going to seek out all my friends I've always known
I'm going back to that farm that I remember
Well, I'm going to spend this summer back home

[Chorus]

[x2]
Back home (back home, back home, back home)
I'll spend my summer (back home)
Back home (back home)

[Verse 2]
I'm going to get up every morning before the roosters
I'll run downstairs fix my breakfast all alone
I'll milk those cows feed the chickens and the horses
Well, I'm going to spend this summer back home

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 3]
I'll eat everything that Ma puts on the table
When I get back you won't believe how I've grown
I'll hit the sack early every night thinking about tomorrow, whoa oh
Well, I'm going to spend this summer back home
Back home, back home, back home

[Chorus]

[x4]

[Verse 1]
There's a lot of things I want
A lot of things that I'd like to be
But girl I don't foresee
A rags to riches story for me
I've given up on schemes
Because everyone fell through
I've given up so many things
Don't ask me to give up on you

[Pre-Chorus]
And baby, baby
Just once in my life
Let me get what I want
Girl don't let me down

[Chorus]
Just once in my life
Let me hold onto
A good thing I found
Don't let me down
Baby, say that you'll be staying

[Verse 2]
I couldn't face the day
If you weren't here by my side
And if you went away
Then I'd be left without any pride

There's just one little dream
I've got to make come true
There's just one round I've got to win
I can't be a loser with you

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Every pot of gold
Ain't so easy to find
And if you'll stand by me
Girl, I'll give you some of mine
I can't give you the world
But I'll work hard for you girl
Well, I'll work hard
Every day
Baby, don't leave me
Now say you won't leave me
Do this for me, baby

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse]
As soon as he turned it on
The wind outside of his room
Stirred up for a few seconds
He thought to himself
"I'll climb out my window
And go sit out there with my radio"
Out the window he went
Sitting against a small stump
Behind some flowerbeds
The light from his bedroom window he could still see
The music of Bach was playing
After a while it began to sound distant
As the young prince gazed at this radio on his knee
The music was floating away from his hearing
What could be happening
He took it off of his knee
And put the radio to his ear
Nothing happened
Then the transistor left his hands
And was floating in the mid-air
Two feet off the ground
As the prince laughed
It suddenly turned around
And it was light green phosphorous in colour
Dancing back and forth
The magic transistor
Started moving down his path
He could hear the sound out
Like nothing he had ever heard before
The trees were getting closer together
And flowers glowed with tinges of magic light
As he followed thinking to himself
"What's going on?"
The transistor lifted slowly
Up to the top of a little tree
And sat there
While it slowly became louder
To where the prince could hear it clearly
Fireflies shot across the path in front of the prince
He turned around and couldn't see the light from his window
There he was watching all alone all by himself
He got a hunch to get back to his room
And he turned and ran right back

[Chorus]
Pied piper, I'd better get back in bed
I hope I'll see you again
Pied piper, I'd better get back in bed
I hope I'll see you again
Pied piper, I'd better get back in bed
Hope I'll see you again
Pied piper, you saw me running along

[Verse]
30 seconds after he was in bed, he fell back to sleep. The next morning he had forgotten all about what had happened the night before. But when night time came once again, his thoughts somehow found their way back to remembering the fascinating episode of the night before

He turned out his bedroom light and sat in his favorite chair. Thoughts danced in his head for a while. "Suppose I went to check and see if my transistor is still down there," he said. "I wonder what would happen."

[Verse]
He sat up in his open window
Looking quietly down at the path
A firefly flew in his room and flew right out again
Down jumped the prince
And he went again to find his radio
(Magic transistor radio)
(Glowing magic transistor radio)
(Glowing magic transistor radio)
As he made his way he could hear something once again
(Glowing magic transistor radio)
There was that transistor up on the same tree
Then from inside of it came a strange voice

[Spoken Word - Brian Wilson]
(Hello I'm the Pied Piper from the far away land of Night)
(Nobody knows anything about my existence)
(I only want to know kids)
(Late at night when people are sleeping)
(I go into their old radios and turn them into magic transistors)
(And fly outside with them)
(I come from such a far away land of Night)
(That I'm fascinated with the funny music I hear on your radios)
(You are the first to know of me)
(You can't see me I'm hidden)
(But you can see the green glow I make)
(I heard you laugh last night)
(I figured that you would be amused by me)
(Listen to this)

[Verse 1]

[Chorus]

[x3]
(Bow bow)
(I'm the Pied Piper)
(Bow bow bow bow bow)
(In the radio)

[Bridge]
Then the prince heard something he never knew could be

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
The hidden Pied Piper was laughing

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
As the prince moved his head back and forth with the music going on

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
When the music died down the Piper said that "every night

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
After midnight if you leave your on your transistor radio

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I'll promise to bring more magic music to you

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
No one" he said " will ever believe you so why tell of me to anyone?

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You are my only friend of night" said the Pied Piper "and I'll talk to
You again some night"

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Then the radio was glowing no more
As it fell into the hands of the fascinated prince
He ran back amazed and he hopped right back into bed
That night he dreamt all night
Mostly about his radio and his friend the Pied Piper
The prince did try what the Piper said to do
But for weeks at night
He heard nothing like the music of that magic night
"That Pied Piper must have been joking" he said
"There's nothing but Bach on this radio
I'm going to throw it back up in the attic for good"
This he sat disbelieving the young prince so loud
That two of his brothers overheard him
The next day those two brothers took the radio from the attic and turned
It on
(Dom dom kingdom)
There it was the music had to be from the Pied Piper himself

[Chorus 2]

[x2]
(My radio is radiating through the)
(Dom dom kingdom)
(Through the misty night)
(Through the misty night)

[Outro]
(Dom dom kingdom)
The prince's sisters ran in their brother's room
(My radio is radiating through the)
(Dom dom kingdom)
And they were all dancing and screaming with joy
(Through the misty night)
(Through the misty night)
But the transistor was playing too loud
And their mother heard it
(Dom dom kingdom)
"What are you doing there? What is that you're listening too?
Give me that radio at once" she said

[Chorus]
I think of going south for the winter
It's getting mighty cold
I watch the fire glow
The moon shining 'cross the snow
Maybe Florida or Mexico
Is where I ought to go

[Verse]
Somewhere where everything is green
Oo the change of scene
Might do a me good
When the swallows go
When they leave Capistrano
Fly away so gracefully
Maybe that's for me
Snowdrifts blowing up against my door
Going clear up to the roof
I could be lying on some sun-washed shore
Truth is, don't know what I'm waiting for

[Chorus]

[Outro]
South of the border
Think I'm going south
Get my life in order
Think I'm going south
For the winter
It's getting mighty cold
(Dom dom kingdom)
There it was the music had to be from the Pied Piper himself!

(My radio is radiatin' through the)
(Dom dom kingdom)
(Through the misty night)
(Through the misty night)

(Dom dom kingdom)
(My radio is radiatin' through the)
(Dom dom kingdom)
(Through the misty night)
(Through the misty night)

(Dom dom kingdom)
The prince's sisters ran in their brother's room
(My radio is radiatin' through the)
(Dom dom kingdom)
And they were all dancing and screaming with joy
(Through the misty night)
(Through the misty night)
But the transistor was playing too loud
And their mother heard it
(Dom dom kingdom)
"What are you doing there? What is that you're listening too?
Give me that radio at once" she said

A few days later the king and queen of the castle were invited to a ball
As they were leaving that evening the queen said to the young prince
Who was the eldest of the children
"Take care of the other ones tonight
And don't try to find that radio
We have it hidden away
We'll be home by midnight"
And then she said "goodbye"
The children's mother left
And the party had begun
And the children looked everywhere
High and low
Checking to see if they could find that transistor radio
They couldn't find it they couldn't find it
They looked upstairs and downstairs
All through the castle and finally
All of a sudden they heard a sound
What is that sound is it possible
Could it be the Pied Piper himself
Coming out of the magic transistor radio
Or was it just the wind whistling by the castle window
No one knows if the mysterious Pied Piper of Night
Was the one who came back to visit the princes and princesses again
But if you have a transistor radio and the lights are all out some night
Don't be very surprised if it turns to light green
And the whirling magic sound of the Pied Piper comes to visit you

[Outro]
(Bow bow)
(I'm the Pied Piper)
(Bow bow bow bow bow)
(In the radio)

[Chorus]
Good good timing
Good good timing

You need good timing
Yeah
Good good timing

[Chorus]
Dow dow

Good good timing

[Verse]
To get to you baby I went through the wringer
Ain't going to let you slip through my fingers
Going to school isn't my fondest desire
But sitting in class you set my soul on fire
God please let us go on this way
All day long I practised what to say-ay
I think about this game that I like to play-ay
When I leave you I'm so depressed
'Because you're my only happiness
God please let us go on this way
Seems we have extra-sensory perception
You can send me thoughts I'd have no objection
Now we can fly high in the sky
We'll live forever, we'll never die

[Outro]
God please let us go on this way-ay
(God please let us go on)
God please let us go on this way-ay
(God please let us go on)
God please let us go on this way-ay
(God please let us go on)
God don't let her slip through my fingers
(God please let us go on)
God please let us go on this way-ay

[Verse 1]
Well she's a roller skating child
With a ribbon in her hair
She gets my heart to beating
When I see her there
You know my heart starts smiling when she sings
She's such an angel I bet she's got wings

[Chorus]
And we'll make sweet loving when the sun goes down
We'll even do more when your mama's not around
Well oh my oh gosh oh gee
She really sends chills inside of me

[Verse 2]
They've got a record playing in the skating rink
She comes skating past me and she gives me a wink
I go and get my skates on and I catch up with her
We do it holding hands, it's so cold I go "brrr"

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Round and around and around we go
The music keeps me on my feet
It's sweet it's sweet it's sweeter than honey
When we're walking down the street
(That's right)

[Verse 3]
We run in to the kitchen and we grab a bite
Her folks let me stay with her until late at night
So many guys want a girl like mine
A love like this happens only one time

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Roller skating child

[Verse 1]
Won't you come here and lie lady Lynda with me
We can lie in the green canyon meadows
And we'll hear the birds sing in the spring

Don't you know if you'll stay lady Lynda with me
We can talk about love everafter
When you lie lady Lynda with me

[Verse 2]
Lynda, won't you say that we can be near

How's about an eight o'clock dinner
How's about a nine o'clock movie
Won't it won't it won't it be groovy
Put your loving arms around me
Aren'tcha aren'tcha glad that you found me
Do you do you like fine wine now
Don't it don't it don't it taste fine now
Can'tcha can'tcha can'tcha just hear it
Rock 'n' rock 'n' rock 'n' roll music
Get-a get-a get-a that beat now
Does it does it does it feel neat now
Will you will you will you just kiss me
When you leave me don't you just miss me
Could we could we could we get married
Enough enough enough of going steady
Disco disco discothèque mama
Show me show me show me the boogie
Start a start a start a little dance now
Take a take a take a little chance now
Come on
Listen to "Da Doo Ron Ron" now
Listen to "Be My Baby"
I know you're going to love Phil Spector

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
He sits behind his microphone
John-ny Car-son
He speaks in such a manly tone
John-ny Car-son

[Chorus]
Ed McMahon comes on and says "Here's Johhny"
Every night at eleven thirty he's so funny
It's (nice) to (have) you (on) the (show) tonight

[Verse 2]
When guests are boring he fills up the slack
John-ny Car-son
The network makes him break his back
John-ny Car-son

[Chorus]
Ed McMahon comes on and says "Here's Johhny"
Every night at eleven thirty he's so funny
Don't (you) think (he's) such (a) natural guy
The (way) he's (kept) it (up) could make you cry

Who's a man that we admire?
Johnny Carson is a real live wire

Johnny Carson is a real live wire
Who's the man that we admire?
Johnny Carson is a real live wire

[Intro]
Oo ooo ooo ooo ooo

[Verse 1]
Now the puzzle's laid out on my table
The pieces don't fit
I move from chair to chair
But that empty one's there where she used to sit
I'm sitting here going out of my mind
Cause she's gone away
She couldn't wait, now I
I'm afraid it's too late

[Chorus]
I'm waiting till my angel comes home
It's been hell being here alone
I'll be in heaven when my angel comes home
Angel, angel come home
If you see her tell my angel come home
Oo oo oo angel come home
If you see her tell my angel to come home

[Verse 2]
Does she remember
That I can't forget
Does she know I regret
I never told her how I
I wanted to hold her
I just let her go
Lonely nights thinking
It's starting to sink in
We had a way to go
We'll grow closer together
By being apart

[Chorus]
When my angel comes home
It's been hell being here alone
God tell me, why has she flown
So far away
I pray she won't stay another day
I'll be in heaven when my angel comes home
Please come home

[Outro]
Angel, come home
If you see her tell my angel come home
Hoo ooo angel, come home
If you see her tell my angel to come home
Hey hey angel, come home
If you see her tell my angel to come home
Ho oo angel come home
If you see her tell my angel to come home
Hey angel come home
If you see her tell my angel to come home
If you see that girl my angel come home
Hey hey angel come home

[Verse]
On my own again, left alone
To remember when
Her love filled my life
Made my life alive her love
Love around me

[Chorus 1]
How can I cope without the love
That I had
(all around me, love surrounds me)
Surround me
The love that I lost was more than
I could hope to find
(love surrounds me, all around me)
Around me

[Chorus]
Did I have love or did love have me
Oo love around me
But there's no
There's no love of my own

[Verse 2]
I gave up our love
But it won't disappear
Oo love around me
Desire
Seems as though
Everywhere I go
Oo love around me
Put your arms around me
Hugging and a-kissing
Making the love I've been missing

[Chorus]
All around me
But there's no
There's no love of my own

[Outro]
Love around me love surround me, no love of my own 

[3x]
Love surround me love around me
Put your love around me

[Verse 1]
My girlfriend Betty she's always ready
To help me in any way
She'll do my cooking she's always looking
For ways she can make my day
And when I'm looking at her the sound of pitter patter
On rainy days like today
Could get you feeling warmer
And you know what-a that can lead to

[Chorus]
Maybe it won't last but what do we care
My baby and I just want a good time
Might go up in smoke now but what do we care
My baby and I just want a good time

[Verse 2]
My girlfriend Penny, she's kind of skinny
And so she needs her falsies on
She don't like cooking but she's so good looking
I miss her when she's gone
And when she gets to dancing I feel just like romancing
Especially when we're dancing close
She'll do the dirty boogie
And that's when I go up in smoke

[Chorus]
Maybe it won't last but what do we care
My baby and I just want a good time
Might end up in tears now but what do we care
My baby and I just want a good time

[Bridge]
Wo wo wo wo wo wo wo uh
Wo wo wo
Woo woo woo woo woo woo woo woo
Wo wo wo

[Chorus]
Maybe it won't last but what do we care
My baby and I just want a good time
But just a few hours with nothin', whoa, what do we care
Let's have a good time

[Outro]
Good time
Oh good time
Oh good time
Goooooood tiiiiiiiiime
Hey

[Verse 1]
Sumahama
There's a lover's leap in old Japan
Where the lovers walk along the sand
Hand in hand at Sumahama
Sumahama
Born a lovely oriental daughter
Never ever having met her father
Asks some questions of her mother

[Chorus]
Tell me tell me mama
Will you ever go again to Sumahama
Perhaps you'll find love there
Somewhere between the Earth the sky and water
There at Sumahama

[Verse 2]
Sumahama
In the autumn as the leaves are falling
One can almost hear the lovers calling
From the sea at Sumahama
Sumahama
Years have past and tears have long since dried
But no amount of time could hope to hide
A love so strong from Sumahama

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Sumahama
Soko wa koi suru hitotachi ga 

[It's where the lovers]
Te ni te o totte aruita 

[Walked hand in hand]
Kireino shiroi hama 

[Beautiful white beach]

[Bridge]
Itsu itsu, mama, Sumahama ni 

[When, when, mama,]
Itsu mata iku no 

[When will you ever go again to Sumahama]
Sugita ai o sagashi ni iku 

[Go searching for the passed love]
Umi no kanata, Sumahama 

[A long way off sea, Sumahama]

[Outro]
Sumahama
There's a lover's leap in old Japan
Where the lovers walk along the sand
Hand and hand at Sumahama
Sumahama
Sumahama, aki ni ki no haga chiru yo ni 

[Sumahama, like in autumn leaves are falling]
Sabishiku kanashii koi no uta 

[Lonely sad love song]
Sumahama no umi kara 

[From the sea at Sumahama]

[Verse]
Honking honking down the gosh darn highway
Trying trying to get past them cars
Got a got a little date with an angel
She's the one that said she'd go with me
To see a little movie tonight
(Honk honk honking down the highway)
Her folks told me that she's lonely
And she loves me only
She's used to running away from guys
Praying praying that she'll hold me tight (hoo!)
And hoping hoping that she'll see the light
Who cares if I got to spend my money
Even if I have to act funny
To go and steal her heart away
(Honk honk honking down the highway)
Take it one little inch at a time now
Until we're feeling fine now
I guess I've got a way with girls

[Bridge]
Honk honk honking down the highway

[x5]
Take it one little inch at a time now
Until we're feeling fine now
I guess I've got a way with girls

[Outro]
Praying praying that she'll hold me tight (yeah)
(Honk honk honking down the highway)
And hoping hoping that she'll see the light
(Honk honk honking down the highway)
Who cares if I gotta spend the night
(Honk honk honking down the highway)

[Verse 1]
My heart was breaking
Till you started making me
Feel like a natural man
My mind was mess
Until you brought happiness
And that's not hard to understand
When I'm through working
Just fussing and cussing
I'll be there just as quick as I can

[Chorus]
Here comes the night
Hold me, squeeze me, don't ever leave me
Tell me I'm doing alright
Hold me, squeeze, me don't ever leave me
Tell me I'm doing alright
Hold me, love me, ooooo

[Verse 2]
I know living is taking and giving
Baby I'm giving you my best
One of these days you know
I'm going to go crazy
In the middle of your caress
When the day goes down
Honey I'll be around
Why don't you wear your pretty red dress

[Chorus]
Here comes the night
Hold me, squeeze me, don't ever leave me
Tell me I'm doing alright
Hold me, squeeze, me don't ever leave me
Tell me I'm doing alright
Hold me, love me, ooooo

[Verse 3]
Every morning our love is reborn
And it lives with me all day long
Things start changing
Take as a little rearranging
But our love grows on and on
Stars who shine in love
Are making you mine to love
I've never felt a love so strong

[Chorus]
Here comes the night
Hold me, squeeze me, don't ever leave me
Tell me I'm doing alright
Hold me, squeeze, me don't ever leave me
Tell me I'm doing alright
Hold me, love me, ooooo

[Verse]

[x2]
Ding (ding) dang (woo!)
Ding and a ding dong
Ding (ding) dang (woo!)
Ding and a ding dong
I love a girl, I love her so madly
I treat her so fine but she treats me so badly

[Outro]
I love a girl, I love her so madly
I treat her so fine but she treats me so badly
I love a girl, I love her so madly
I treat her so fine but she treats me so badly

[Verse 1]
Lie alone in bed at night
Feel the pull of a lonely day
Abstract music start to play
I wonder where you were today

[Chorus]
(Baby blue)
Baby baby blue
Baby blue eyes I dream of you

[Verse 2]
Late at night
When the whole world's sleeping
I dream of you
Close to you I feel your sweet heart beating
I dream of you
Late at night late at night
Honey late at night I dream of you
I dream of you

[Chorus]
Baby baby blue
Baby blue eyes I love you new
I hold you in my dreams tonight
Hold you until morning light

[Outro]
(Baby)
Baby baby blue

Baby blue eyes I dream of you

Baby blue eye I dream of you

[Verse 1]
What do the planets mean? And have you ever seen
Sunrise in the morn? It shined when you were born
Saturn has rings all around it
I searched the sky and I found it

[Chorus]
Solar system
Brings us wisdom

[Verse 2]
Then there's the Milky Way, that's where the angels play
You've seen the lover's moon, looks good in the month of June
Neptune is god of the sea-ea-ea
Pluto is too far to see-ee-ee

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
The constellations are stars that form animals
Leo and Capricorn, too
Star bright, star light
Make this wish come true tonight

[Verse 3]
If Mars had life on it I might find my wife on it
Venus the goddess of love can thank all the stars above
Mercury's close to the sun
You'll see it when day is done

[Chorus]

[x3]

[Verse 1]
The night was so young and everything still
The moon shining bright on my window sill
I think of her lips, it chills me inside
And then I think why does she have to hide

[Chorus]
Is somebody going to tell me why she has to hi-i-ide
She's passing it by, she won't even try
To make this love go where it should

[Verse 2]
The sky's turning gray, there's clouds overhead
I'm still not asleep, I'm in my bed
I think of her eyes and it makes me sigh
I think of her voice and it makes me cry

[Chorus]
Is somebody going to tell me why she has to lie-i-ie
She'd be so right to hold me tonight
Love was made for her and I

[Verse 3]
It's three o'clock I go to my sink
I pour some milk and I start to think
Is she asleep or is she awake
And does she think of the love we could make

[Chorus]
Wake up, call me baby call me tell me what's on your mi-i-ind
I've got a car and you're not too far
Please let me come over to you

[Verse 1]
The night was so young and everything still
The moon shining bright on my window sill
I think of her lips, it chills me inside
And then I think why should she hide

[Verse 1]
I'll bet he's nice
I'll bet he's twice
As nice as me and it makes me cry
Because I remember you and I
Please don't tell me if it's true
Because I'm still in love with

[Chorus]
You, pretty darling, you, my pretty darling
You, pretty darling, you, my pretty darling

[Verse 2]
I'll bet he's sweet
(Baby oooo)
I'll bet he's neat
(Baby oooo)

I'll bet he's funny and that ain't all
I'll bet he shows you quite a ball
Please don't tell me if it's true
Because I'm still in love with

[Chorus]
You, pretty darling, you, my pretty darling
You, pretty darling, you, my pretty darling

[Bridge]
Baby, don't you ever tell me that you're leaving
Now that you got me to believing
You are the sunshine and the flower
Come on and make my every hour

[Verse 1]
I'll bet he's nice
I'll bet he's twice
As nice as me and it makes me cry
'Cause I remember you and I
Please don't tell me if it's true
Because I'm still in love with

[Outro]
You, pretty darling, you, my pretty darling
(You, you my darling)
You, pretty darling, you, my pretty darling
(Well it's you my darling, you my darling)
You, pretty darling, you, my pretty darling
(Well it's you my darling, you my darling)
You, pretty darling, you, my pretty darling
(Well it's you my darling, you my darling)

[Chorus] 

[2x]
Mama's little baby loves shortening shortening
Mama's little baby loves shortening bread

[Verse 1]
Put on the skillet
Slip on the lid
Mammy's going to make us some shortening bread
And that ain't all
Our mammy's going to do
She's going to cook us some coffee, too

[Chorus] 

[3x]

[Verse 2]
I slipped in the kitchen
Raised up the lid
I stole me a mess of that shortening bread
I walked up to a pretty girl and I said
Baby how'd you like some shortening bread

[Chorus] 

[2x]

[Verse 3]
They caught me with the skillet
They caught me with the lid
They caught me with the girl eating shortening bread
Six months for the skillet
Six months for the lid
Now I'm doing time for eating shortening bread

[Chorus] 

[2x]

Shortening
Shortening bread
Shortening
Shortening bread

[Chorus] 

[2x]

[Verse 1: Brian and Marilyn]
I don't want to tell you that I care for you
And have you just ignore me
It's better that I wait and see just how you feel
And maybe you'll adore me
I know you've had so much experience
That you don't need another person in your life
I know it may sound funny
But you're the kind of woman
Who'd make a very sweet wife

[Verse 2: Brian and Marilyn]
Take your time, don't worry how you feel because
You know we've got forever
Maybe I'll come up with some idea and
You'd think that I was clever
I've never had someone I need someone
To live with and be good to
Don't worry about your past loves
And if they've never understood you

[Chorus]
Let's put our hearts together
And say we'll leave each other never
Let's see what we can cook up between us

[Outro]
Together
Together
Together you and I

[Verse 1]
I love to pick you up
Because you're still a baby to me
Cribs and cradles and bottles and toys
Are part of the joys they bring
I want to wash your face
And change your clothes and button your shoes
Walk you around and wrestle with you
Then I'm going to make you sing
In the morning I could wake you up
Feed you breakfast from a little cup

[Chorus]
I want to pick you up
Rock you back and forth and make you smile
I want to hold you close for a while

[Verse 2]
I want to tickle your feet
Drop you in your little tub
Wash your body and shampoo your hair
Be careful not to sting your eyes
When it's night I'll put you in your bed
And I'll bend and kiss you on your head

[Chorus]
I want to pick you up
Rock you back and forth and make you smile
I want to hold you close for a while

[Outro]
Pat pat pat pat pat her on her butt butt
She's going to sleep be quiet
Pat pat pat pat pat her on her butt
She's going to sleep (Little baby go to sleep)

[Verse 1]
Over the city in an airplane
I can see everything below
The houses they look so tiny
The cars look like dots
We've only got fifteen minutes to go
The clouds in the sky caress my mind so tenderly
The sun shines down on the great big beautiful sea

[Verse 2]
The sound of the engine fills my ears up
I'm hoping this rainy weather clears up
My lover is waiting at the airport
Soon she'll be kissing me hello
The woman sitting next to me tells me 'bout her guy
And I tell her all about you and I

[Chorus]
Airplane, airplane
Carry me back to her side
Airplane, airplane
I need God as my guide
Down, down on the ground
Can't wait to see her face

[Outro]
(a-1, a-2, a-1, 2, 3)
I can't wait (can't wait)
To see (her face)
I can't wait (can't wait)
To see (her face)
I can't wait (can't wait)
To see (her face)
I can't wait (can't wait)
To see (her face)
I can't wait (can't wait)
To see (her face)
I can't wait (can't wait)
To see (her face)
I can't wait (can't wait)
To see (her face)
I can't wait (can't wait)
To see (her face)
I can't wait (can't wait)
To see (her face)

[Verse 1]
Love is a woman
So treat her tenderly tonight
Love makes a woman
So give her all your love tonight

[Chorus]
A woman is love, and if you're smart
You'll tease her, please her tonight
So take my advice, you just treat her nice
And you'll find that woman is love

[Verse 2]
Love is a woman
So tell her she smells good tonight
Love is a woman
So make her feel that way tonight

[Chorus]
A woman is love, and if you're smart
You'll tease her, please her tonight
So take my advice, you just treat her nice
And you'll find a woman in love

[Bridge]
1, 2, 3 (2, 3 ahhh) She's falling in love with me
4, 5, 6 (5, 6 ahhh) She fell for all my tricks
7, 8, 9 (8, 9 ahhh) She makes me feel so fine

[Verse 1]
Love is a woman
So treat her tenderly tonight
Love is a woman
So give her all your love tonight

[Outro]
Love is a woman (dip dip dip)
Love is a woman (dip dip dip Just treat her nice)
Love is a woman (dip dip dip Take my advice)
(dip dip dip And just treat her nice)

[Verse]
Last night I went out disco dancing
Saw a foxy girl out on the floor
She's got rhythm, she's got something I need
She's got rhythm, she's got something I need
She came to my table
We both ordered something to drink (something to drink)
Before you know it, what do you think
The music started playing
Oo the music got us so excited
And we had to get up on our feet
She's got rhythm, she's got something I need
She's got rhythm, she's got something I need
The place was near closing
I offered to take her home (take her home)
But she was with someone and left me alone
But I still remember

[Outro]
Oo I know I never will forget her
And I hope I get to see her again
She's got rhythm, she's got something I need
(never will forget her)
She's got rhythm, she's got something I need
(never will forget her)
She's got rhythm, she's got something I need
(never will forget her)
She's got rhythm, she's got something I need
(never will forget her)
She's got rhythm, she's got something I need
(never will forget her)
Hey hey
Hey hey
Hey hey
Never will forget her

[x2]
Bow bow bow bow oop
Ahh ooo oohh waaa oooo

[Verse 1]
The other night they were playing our song
Hadn't heard it for oh so long
Took me back darling to that time in my car
When you cried all night cause we'd gone too far

[Chorus]
Can I ever get you back
Get you back baby
Going to get you back get you back
Get you back get you back baby
Going to get you back get you back
Can I ever get you back

[Verse 2]
I'm getting tired laying around here at night
Thinking about some other guy holding you tight
He may have money and a brand new car
May even treat you like a movie star
And no matter what he ever do for you
He can never love you like I can do
So if I leave her and you leave him

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Bow bow bow oop

[x2]
(Get you back) I'll leave her
(Get you back) and you leave him
(Get you back) can we baby
(Get you back) get it back again

[x2]

[Outro]
(Get you back) I'll leave her
(Get you back) and you leave him

[Verse 1]
Hey, little tomboy, sit here on my lap
I got things that I gotta tell you
No more skateboards, put away your baseball mitt
Your rough living days are through
You could find places to go
You could see that boys love you so
They're doing it all over the world

[Chorus]
Hey little hey little hey little tomboy
Time to turn into a girl
Hey little hey little hey little tomboy
They're doing it all over the world

[Verse 2]
Hey, little tomboy, I've had my eyes on you
Thinking what a girl you could be
Mmm, I smell perfume, let's try some cut-off jeans
Look at all the changes I see
I'm going to teach you to kiss
You're going to feel just like this
They're doing it all over the world

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
It's been my secret passion to try it
In Captain Cook fashion, I can't deny it
I want to spend my winters on the Kona coast in Hawaii
For years I saved my pennies and planned it
The great Pacific Ocean we'll span it
I want to go surfing where I dig it the most, in Hawaii

[Chorus]
(Go to Hawaii)
Hawaiian islands beckon (Hawaii)
And I'll be back here someday, I reckon
And pretty island girls greet you with a flower lei
You'll throw it back into the sea
Hoping you be coming back to Hawaii

[Verse 2]
Suntanned beauties are everywhere
Lovely island ladies with long dark hair
You're sure to find a honey waiting for you there in Hawaii
Kani and Wahini and Wahowalis, too
Get a friendly aloha from this mecca to you
They're the friendliest people anywhere in Hawaii

[Chorus]
(Go to Hawaii)
Welcome to the island mecca. (Hawaii)
I'll learn to talk like a local, I betcha
And at Lahaina look out for shooting stars
We'll watch them fall into the sea
And it will be just you and me in Hawaii

[Bridge]
Winter in the sun and surf would sure be nice
In a south sea garden of paradise
I want to spend my summer on the Kona coast in Hawaii

[Outro]
(Honolulu, Waikiki, do you want to come along with me?)
(Waimia up to Hanalai, love to take you to the islands today)

[Chorus]
It's getting late
I can't wait
Come-a-come-a little closer
You got to tell me that you'll stay

[Verse 1]
I've been praying for this moment
Since the second I laid eyes on you
Minutes seem like hours
When you're gone
Girl I'm getting tired of waiting
So stop your hesitating
I can't believe you keep me hanging on
It's getting late-ate-ate-ate
Ooo (it's getting late)
Time waits for no one
Love is a turn on

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
You got me in a situation
My love is rising high
Don't let any more love pass us by
Girl, we can make it up to paradise
Just give it a try
So hurry now and girl make up your mind

[Bridge]

[x2]
It's getting late
Don't know how much more I can stand

[Verse 3]
Girl I need your loving
I'm so tired of waiting
Come on there's no one else around
Ooo sweet girl it's getting late
So please don't hesitate
Been waiting to get your defenses down

[Verse 1]
I've been keeping my eyes on you
I finally found the nerve to talk to you
There's something that you ought to know
Don't you know that I love you so
Our life together could be eternal bliss
If we could just get close enough to kiss
And you know I'd like to get a crack at your love

[Chorus]
Crack at your love

[x2]

[Verse 2]
You make me feel so warm inside
A sense of humor you can't hide
Who taught you darling how to move that way?
And when you smile I know the world's okay
And when I see the twinkle in your eye
It sends my heart all the way to the sky
And you know I'd like to get a crack at your love

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Lonely nights, lonely days

[x2]
I'm reaching out for you
In my mind

[x2]

[Verse 3]
I'm going crazy
Would you be my baby
I'm going to need a little help from above
Would you say "no" if I asked for your love?
I can't afford to get hurt again
Like the time I remember when
But I know I'd like to get a crack at your
And you know I'd like to get a crack at your
Don't you know I'd like to get a crack at your love

[Chorus]

[repeat until fade]
Don’t you know that I love you?
Honest, I do (oh, honest, I do)
I’d never placed no one above you

Please tell me you love me (tell me you love me)
Stop drivin’ me mad
'Cause you’re the sweetest and the best thing baby (sweetest and the best thing, yeah)
That I’ve ever had

Oh, don’t you know that I love you? (you know that I love)
Honest, baby, I do
And I’d never place no one above you, no

Ooh-ooh
Hmm-hmm

Oh, you know I love you, baby
Honest, I do (honest, I do)
And I’d never place, oh-oh
No one above you, yeah, yeah, yeah
You know that I love you, baby, love you, baby (love you, baby)
Honest, I do (oh, honest, I do)
And you know that I’d never place no one above you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, baby

[Verse 1]
If you knew a-Peggy Sue
Then you'd know why I feel blue
My Peggy a-my Peggy Sue
Well I love you, girl, yes I love you, Peggy Sue

[Chorus]

[x2]
Peggy Sue, Peggy Sue
Oh how my heart yearns for you
Oh Peggy--my Peggy Sue
Well I love you, girl, yes I love you, Peggy Sue

[Verse 2]
I love you, Peggy Sue
With a love so rare and true
Oh Peggy--my-my Peggy Sue
Well I love you, girl, and I want you, Peggy Sue

[Chorus]
Peggy Sue, Peggy Sue
Pretty pretty pretty pretty Peggy Sue
My Peggy a-my Peggy Sue
Well I love you, girl, and I want you, Peggy Sue
Well I love you, girl, and I want you, Peggy Sue
(Pretty pretty pretty pretty Peggy Sue)

[Chorus 1]
Well there's nothing worse than a passing friend
Who will die on you till the bitter end
There's nothing worse than a burning heart
Or a past that tears the world apart

[Verse 1]
I've been thinking about my situation
Nothing ventured nothing left to lose
When it's easier to just say nothing
I had thought about what I might lose

[Chorus 2]
But through the child's eyes
There were feelings
Touching my violet skin
When the love games start appealing
YOu better get out and move on in

[Chorus 3]
Because there's nothing worse than a passing friend
Or a pioneer of a dying trend
Nothing worse than a silent ghost
Or to lose your head at the starting post

[Verse 2]
Ain't it always just a short vacation
When it's love it always has an end
Under the sheets of life it's just frustration
While the body goes in search again

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Bridge]
Why do you love someone
Who wants to break your heart
Why do you need someone
Who wants to tear your world apart
No no not again

[Verse 3]
I was packing up my life in cases
For a hundred years or maybe more
I've been talking to a million people
Don't you think I should have known the score

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 3]

[Outro]
No no not again

[Intro]
Why don'tcha
Come (come, come-a, come-a)
Tonight (come out tonight)
Why don'tcha
Come (come, come-a, come-a)
Tonight (come out tonight)

[Chorus 1]
Little girl, wontcha come out tonight?
They're playing our song
Little girl, wontcha come out tonight?
Please don't keep me long

[Verse 1]
I've been anticipating, seeing you all day long
And all the while I'm waiting
I find myself a-singing this little song

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2]
Soon as the music start playing
I start to thinking of you
That's when you'll hear me saying
Pretty please, baby, here's what I ask of you

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3]
Late at night when I'm sleeping
I get to dreaming of you
That's when I find myself scheming
Of ways that I can spend all my nights with you

[Chorus 2]

[x7]
Oh won'tcha
Come (come, come-a, come-a)
Tonight (come out tonight)
Oh won'tcha
Come (come, come-a, come-a)
Tonight (come out tonight)

[Chorus 1]
Late last night I got an S. O. S
The fairy tale girl's in deep in distress
She says I don't know where I am
But it's near Japan

[Chorus 2]
My engine's all burned out
My crew has all bailed out
I don't know where I am
But it's somewhere near Japan

[Verse 1]
And she said
"Rescue me
I'm somewhere in the
China Sea
I think I'm sinking fast
This call is probably my last
I'm throwing out a life line
And I'm doing it for old time's sake
Though I know you're gonna break my heart
One more time

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Bridge]
And she said "thank you dear
I think she sounded quite sincere
And when she turned to go
She said "I crave adventure don't you know

[Outro]
And now she's drifting on some Chinese junk
Her world is spinning and her hope has sunk
So I close my eyes
And somewhere near Japan
The spinning stopped and the world stood still
I broke her fall and I always will
Strung out in no man's land
Somewhere near Japan
Rescue me

[Verse]
There's something special about it
Just what, I can't quite say
But there's no doubt that it's different
From any other day
There are no words to exactly describe
What I'm speakin' of
It's just a sweet Sunday kinda love
We'll read the funnies together
And watch some T.V. too
You can do something for me
And I'll do the same for you
We'll fill the hours with things
That we both most like to do
Spending a sweet Sunday lovin' you
Why don't we unplug the phone?
Let's pretend nobody's home, quietly
Just you and me, oh how nice that will be
All through the week I'll look back upon that
Sweet Sunday time
While looking forward to that special happiness
We'll find
When we awaken to hear from a songbird up above
Sounds of a sweet Sunday kinda love

[Verse 1]
Them that's god shall get
Them that's not shall lose
So the bible says
And it still is news

[Chorus]
Momma may have
Poppa may have
God bless the child
That's got his own
That's got his own

[Verse 2]
Well, the strong gets more
While the weak ones fade
Empty pockets don't
Ever make the grade

[Chorus]
Momma may have
Poppa may have
God bless the child
That's got his own
That's got his own

[Verse 3]
You've got lots of friends
Crowding round the door
And when it's gone and
Spending ends
Rich relations will give you
A crust of bread and such
You can help yourself
But don't take too much

[Chorus]
Momma may have
Poppa may have
God bless the child
That's got his own
That's got his own

[Intro]
Ray oh ah ha
Ray oh ah ha
Radio ah ha
You know
Ray oh ah ha
Radio ah
I'm gonna make her mine
Bom bom bom ba ba bom bom bom bom

[Verse 1]
I went to Trinidad I didn't
Know just what I had 'til I
Found her

She wears a pretty smile
That compliments her shapely
Style and I found her

Island girl she's oh so pretty
Island girl I like her plenty
Island girl I'm gonna make her mine

[Chorus 1]
Island girl she makes me happy
Island girl she kinda sassy
Island girl I'm gonna make her mine

[Verse 2]
Everybody's got an island fantasy
For me it's like a Caribbean odyssey
All the people live and love there by the sea
Near the sparkling weather beneath the coco-palm tree

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3]
She's fine so fine all mine
She's so good to me
And I know (i know) our love (or love) so free (so free
That it was meant to be

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 4]
She's a real beauty from the Caribbean
Long dark hair flowing in the breeze
She's the kinda beauty makes you come alive and
We can live together for eternity
Every now and then I get this silly grin
When I'm there in her company
She says I'm crazy that I'm also very lazy
I know she loves me

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 1]
You got me calling at all hours of the night
I don't think it's right
But still I do it
You got me thinking your existence is my life
It's time to see the light
I think I'll leave it

[Chorus]
Maybe, I don't know
I tried to take it slow
But I don't know
Maybe, I don't know
But if you say it's so
We can make it go
Maybe, I don't know

[Verse 2]
Whatever made me think that we could make it good?
Did you think we ever would?
No need in lying
No, no, no
I need your guarantee so I can be assured
Do you ever think you could?
No more depriving
Na-a-na-na-na

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Chorus]
Bells are ringing, soul of France
Bells are singing of romance

[Verse 1]
C'est tres jolie en Paris in the spring
Watching all the lovers walk along the Seine
Pitch a penny in her like a wishing well
Feed the pigeons in the park near Tour-Eifelle

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
There's a chapel "Sacre Coure" in quaint Montmarte
In the open air the painters show their art
In the restaurant sip a beaujolies
What a perfect way to spend a lovely day

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Sunday morning, hear the bells of Notre Dame
Watching belles jeunes filles and the handsome gendarmes
Near the Arc De Triomphe on the Champs-Elysees
Coffee and croissants in a sidewalk cafe
Some people go to see the races at Deauville
Or weekend by the racing tides of Mont San Michelle
Some take the tour of Chartres on an autobus
While the writers and the artists never leave Mont Parnasse

[Verse 1]
When I'm behind the wheel
Horses of gas and steel
The highway is my home
In fiberglass and chrome
Fantasy car shiny Corvette
Let's take a ride you can't forget
Come on pretty lady ride with me

[Chorus 1]
In my car
I'm captain of my destiny
In my car
Pretty babe come cruise with me

[Chorus 2]
Come for a drive
And we'll arrive
Feeling alive

[Verse 2]
I'm master of my fate
When I accelerate
My new Vette is my throne
When on the road we roam we roam we roam roam
Cruising like we're in a dream
Feeling like we're still sixteen
Being a part of the great American scene

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 3]
Cruise cruise cruise with me baby
Now move move up in the stratosphere
Zoom zoom zoom with me darling now
We're still cruising after all these
Cruising after all these years

Wind blowing in my hair
I feel like a millionaire
Radio is blasting strong
We're breaking out in song
Blazing trails both near and far
Park my car behind a star
Life is full of possibilities

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 1]
I want her I need her
But I never let her know before
Kept her in the dark
Thought I lost her heart forever
She told me "just show me
The feelings that you keep inside
And I promise that
We can put it back together"

[Chorus]
She believes in love again
She belives in me
Now we've gone far beyond
The way we used to be
And in her eyes from deep inside
She finally let me see
She believes in love again
She belives in me

[Verse 2]
I woke up I spoke up
And let her know the way I feel
Changes I could make
Wouldn't have to take a lifetime
She wants me she needs me
She always let me know before
And now it's up to me
To give her all the things she needs the right way

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I just nearly blew it
How could I do it
I think about the pain I had put her through
God I'm sorry
She said she'd recover
If only I'd love her
She'd open up her soul
And share her life with me

[Chorus]

[Outro]
In her eyes from deep inside
She finally let me see that
She believes in love again
She believes in me

[Chorus 1]
Make it big
So big

[Chorus 2]
You can make it big
You can make it bigger than life
See your name spelled right
Up on the bright lights
Bright lights

[Chorus 3]
Have a little faith in yourself
In everything that you do
I know you're going to make it big if you want to
If you really want to
You can make it big

[Chorus 4]
Bright lights

[Chorus 3]

[Verse 1]
Baby, you're a superstar
I believe you're going far
Do what you want
Why don't you do what you want to

Be my little movie queen
Up there on the silver screen
Do what you want
Go on and do what you want to
Catch a plane to Hollywood
And right away
You're best buddies with Johnny B. Goode
And he says
"Baby, welcome to the neighborhood"
Now you can do what you want
Do what you wanna

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 4]

[Chorus 3]

[Chorus 4]

[Chorus 3]

[Chorus 1]

[Outro]
Oh, I know you can make it
Everybody you can make it
Yes, I know we can make it big
Darling, you can make it
I know you're going make it
Ooh, baby you can make it big

[Verse 1]
If everybody in the U.S.A
Could come with us to Californ-i-a
We could take them to a place out west
Where the good sun shines everyday
Now there's a touch of Californ-i-a
In everyone who's ever been this way
And when your telephone begins to ring
And the operator comes on the line

[Chorus]
California calling
I'll be there right away
There's some beautiful women
Going to find me one
To show me how to ride the ultimate wave

[Verse 2]
Now I've joined the surfing nation and so
I'll take a permanent vacation and go
To the golden shores of 'Frisco Bay
I'll ride them all the way to Malibu
And I'll take you boogie boarding with me
Because when we're surfing it's so great to be free
And when you're on a California beach
You might even find them windsurfing too

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
In the fifties it was "Hey Daddy O"
Then came the surfers and the Hodads you know
We had our woodies and our custom cars
And when we drove around we knew we were bad
My baby listens to my car radio
And when we're cruising lets the whole world know
And when our favorite surfing song comes on
We always let them know it's "Totally Rad!"

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
California calling
She's still on the line
There's a beautiful woman
Going to show me how
To ride them at the county line

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I'm so lonely
Really, really so lonely
I wish that you'd come comfort me whoa
I'm so broken-hearted
Since we've been parted

[Chorus]
I've wished since you went away
That you'd soon be back to stay
I'm so lonely for your love tonight

[Verse 2]
Since you left, it's been this way
Every night and every day
When will it
When will it ever change whoa

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I've spent my whole life drifting
Towards an elusive sun
I would have wandered forever
If your breeze hadn't come
And you just could be my anchor
You are my northern star
That navigates me home

[Chorus]
Don't need to search no more exotic islands
No that I found you're right where I belong
Never been so much at home as I am
Loving you is right where I belong

[Verse 2]
In my mind we're together
Even when I'm alone
My heart leaves you never
Never will our love grow old
My destination forever
You are my shining star that navigates me home

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
When you say you do
Makes me want to spend life with you
I never knew life could be so good
When you say you care

[Pre-Chorus]
Want to be right there beside you
And show the world
You've been good to me
And you know I do

[Chorus]
All my love
You are my love
Without your love I go nowhere
All my love
You are my life
You are the girl I'm dreaming of
You're the one I really love
I do love you

[x4]

[Verse 2]
When you say it's true
Lets me know we'll be forever
Insightful joy
Of a love so good

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I do love you

[repeat until fade]

[Verse]
Darling I'm lost without you
Sad with nothing to do
It's just a matter of time

[Chorus]
Whoa darling
What is it you're doing
What's that mood that's brewing
It's just a matter of time

[Bridge]
When we went our seperate ways for the first time
I was sure that it would be the last time

[Chorus]

[Outro]
It's just a matter of time

[Verse]
Male ego walking down the street
Sees something looking hot and sweet
Hey, baby would you like to meet me tonight?
Male ego is a worldwide game
We love the ladies more than wealth and fame
Lots of girls running through my brain tonight
Male ego is played by all
Chasing ladies and having a ball
Hey girl, I'm going to give you a call tonight
Don't know why we love to chase those tasty ladies
Betcha boys we'll be doing it in our eighties
Male ego's like a game of chance
The gamble starts with just a glance
You're off and running with a new romance tonight
Male ego won't ever quit
It seems to me from where I sit
We ought to do our bit to capture it tonight

[Outro]
You look nice
What's your name?
You smell nice

I can't wait 'til summer (yeah)
Cause it's gonna be a summer of love
Hey now (well it's a love thing)

[Verse 1]
People all around the world in every nation
Like to get together for some excitations
If you're a girl appreciates her recreation
Why don't you let me take you on a love vacation
Yeah I'll take you to the movies
But I'm no fool (wah wah oooo)
First, I'll get you on the beach
Or in a swimming pool
Doing unto others is the golden rule
But doing it with you would be so
Very cool

[Chorus]
Girls are always ready for a summer of love
Going out and looking for love (girls are always ready)
Girls are always ready for a summer of love (sum sum summer summer of love)
Going out and looking for love (sum sum summer summer of love)
I can't wait 'til summer (yeah)
Cause it's gonna be a summer of love
Hey now (well it's a love thing)

[Verse 2]
Every time the weather starts to getting hotter
Don't worry about it toss your clothes and hit the water
We'll be California dreaming bay watching every day
Just off the Malibu surfing USA
Now no girl ever wants to leave their
Love back home (wah wah oooo)
So if you miss him, baby
Call him on the phone
But make it quick
We're almost in a party zone
Cause summer days and nights
Aren't meant to spend alone

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Now summer is a time when there're no strings attached
But we could get together if you come on back
I'd like to tell you if it's any satisfaction
You'll always be my summer season's main attraction

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
After six hours of school I've had enough for the day
I hit the radio dial and turn it up all the way

[Chorus]
You got to dance (dance dance dance now the beat's really hot) right on
The spot

The beat's really hot
(Dance dance dance now the beat's really hot)

In my car a wild record drives me out of my tree
And I punch all the buttons for a station that swings

[Verse 1]
Don't ever say you're not afraid of any wave boy
Then turn and run for your life cause you're not thrilled boy
(Don't back down don't back down) (di di di di)
Just grit your teeth take it on but don't back down

[Chorus]
Don't back down don't back down

[x3]
From that wave

[Verse 2]
I used to laugh when I saw a surfer go under
(Don't back down don't back down) (di di di di)
Until I tried it and my ears sounded just like thunder
(Don't back down don't back down) (di di di di)
I know what it's like when you feel like backing down

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
It's just as scary as it looks and it's rough enough now
(Don't back down don't back down) (di di di di)
And if you're any kind of athlete you're tough enough now
(Don't back down don't back down) (di di di di)
You're going to find out when you start backing down

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I need a breeze blowing softly
To keep my wind vane from standing
I need a whole lot of sunshine
To keep my sundial advancing
I need some soil before my grass will grow
I need some spark to make my candle glow

[Chorus 1]
Relief I cried
There is no shuck 'n' jive
I need a mess of help to stand alone

[Verse 2]
I need a spark by a fire
To stop the cold of my winter
I need a burst of your raindrops
To keep a flow in my river
I need a call for my phone will ring
I need your song for my voice will sing
Please realize
I'm not half alive
Without a mess of help to stand alone

[Chorus 2]
(She don't know me)
(She don't know it)
(She don't know)
(She don't know me)
(She don't know it)
(She don't know)
(She don't know me)
(She don't know it)

[Verse 3]
I need the warmth of your smile
To heat my frostbitten sorrow
I need your hand on my shoulder
To lead today's to tomorrows
I need your strength to lock me to the track
I need your trust to bust the things I lack

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2] 

[x2]
I've been in this town so long that back in the city I've been taken for a lost and gone an unknown for a long, long time
Fell in love years ago with an innocent girl from the Spanish and Indian ho-home of the Heroes and Villains

Once at night, cotillion squared the fight and she was right in the rain of the bullets that eventually brought her down
But she's still dancing in the night unafraid of what a dude'll do in a town full of Heroes and Villains

In the Cantina, Margarita's keep the spirit high
There I watched her
She spun around and wound in the warmth
Her body fanned the flame of the dance-
Dance, Margarita! Don't you know that I love with you?
Dance...
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!!!

My Children were raised, you know they suddenly rise, they started slow long ago, head-to-toe; healthy, wealthy and often wise
At three score and five I'm very much alive, I still got the jive to survive with the Heroes and Villains

[Verse 1]
Here she comes
Breathing life in to my thoughts
There she goes
Leaves a portrait in my soul
Rolling in madness
She does everything to me
Wherever she goes you know the devil dances
And the gods lay down in defeat

[Chorus]
Am I living
Crazy woman can't you see
That I'm giving
Giving to you can you dig
Me

[Verse 2]
I want to live
To learn the truth before my door
Don't you know
I'm a simple man for all I know
This might be the hard way
But it's easier for me
To take all the changes that are always amazing
But to never let them fence me in

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Me I'm only searching for the things I really need
I can't rely on anyone to sow and grow my seeds
I started out on empty promise I was living on my dreams
I was a runaway son and now I'm up out of the water
And I can barely barely breathe

[Bridge]
Rolling down the road

[x5]
Listen listen
Hear the music play
Listen listen
Hear the music play yeah
Listen listen
Hear the music play
Listen listen
Hear the music play

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
People have you heard of the world plan
To know the inner nature of every man
Jesus came down to save the world from sin
Saying "Seek ye first the kingdom within"
Maharishi teaches us to meditate
To dive deep within come out and radiate
All of the saints through all creation
Sing the same song of revelation

[Chorus]
I believe it (Dig deep if you know what I mean yeah)
(I believe him)
I believe it (Dig deep if you know what I mean now)
(In my heart)
I believe it (Dig deep if you know what I mean now)
(in my soul) (Dig deep if you know what I mean now)
I believe it (Dig deep if you know what I mean now)
(Zarathustra)???
I believe it (Dig deep if you know what I mean now)
(???)
I believe it (Dig deep if you know what I mean now)
(To believe)
I believe it (Dig deep if you know what I mean now)
(Way down inside)
I believe it
He came down down down down down down down
Yes I mean down down down down
Yes he did
From the glorious kingdom

[Verse 2]
Hey-yon-du-coma-nauga-ton
Means avoid the suffering before it comes
Krishna said a long time ago
To "To let the arrow fly first pull back the bow"
Guru Dev's wisdom is just the thing

[?]
To save mankind from all this suffering
Maharishi gives a lift to every man's bible
Bringing us the news of the new revival

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Men see, cries before the road
Say can a wall bleed
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo
Tell me life is over
It begins
Within my world
You've got to believe it's so
(2-3-4-5-6-7)
Yes I believe it
Yes I believe it
Yes I beliiiiieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeve
Ooh

[Verse 3]
He came down
To make me care for my home
Gave me a song
To help the sound of my own
Showed me the way
To get through every day
I thank you my Lord
For sending this man home
Mmmmmm
Oh oh oh oh
Yeah
Ohoh
Yeah
He came down

[Chorus]
I believe it (oh yeah)
I believe it
I believe it (Down in my soul)
I believe it (Come and....my ...)
I believe it (Oh Lord this kingdom)
I believe it (To believe)
I believe it (Oh yes I believe)
I believe it (I'm talking about Jesus)
I believe it
I believe it (to believe)

[Chorus 1]
(Hey yeah Marcella)
(Hey yeah Marcella)
She's a bright girl
(Hey yeah Marcella)
Hey hey
(Hey yeah Marcella)

[Verse 1]
Mystic maiden's more than soft and sexy
She can mess my mind with the stuff that she knows
Her new found beauty goes beyond her covering
And sets a flame in her soul

[Chorus 2]
One arm over my shoulder
Sandals dance at my feet
Eyes that'll knock you right over
Ooo Marcella's so sweet

[Chorus 1]
(Hey yeah Marcella)
(Hey yeah Marcella)
She's a bright girl
(Hey yeah Marcella)
Hey hey

[Verse 2]
Brave new woman standing proud and dazzling
Grips the goal that eluded her soul
Direction bringing her to now's tomorrow
And my love for her still grows

[Chorus 2]
One arm over my shoulder
Sandals dance at my feet
Eyes that'll knock you right over
Ooo Marcella's so sweet

[Chorus 1]
(Hey yeah Marcella)

She's a bright girl
(Hey yeah Marcella)
Hey hey

[Chorus 2]
One arm over my shoulder
Sandals dance at my feet
Eyes that'll knock you right over
Ooo Marcella's so sweet

[Chorus 2]
One arm over my shoulder
Sandals dance at my feet
Eyes that'll knock you right over
Ooo Marcella's so sweet

[Chorus 3]
When she puts one arm over my shoulder
Sandals dance at my feet
Eyes that knock you right over
Ooo, Marcella's so sweet
When she puts one arm over my shoulder
Sandals dance at my feet
Eyes that knock you right over
Ooo, Marcella's so sweet
When she puts one arm over my shoulder
Sandals dance at my feet
Eyes that knock you right over
Ooo, Marcella's so sweet

[Chorus]
All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray
I've been for a walk on a winter's day
I'd be safe and warm if I was in L.A
California dreaming on such a winter's day

[Verse]
Stopped in to a church I passed along the way
Well I got down on my knees and I pretend to pray
You know the preacher likes the cold
He knows I'm gonna stay
California dreaming on such a winter's day

[Chorus]
All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray
I've been for a walk on a winter's day
I'd be safe and warm if I was in L.A
California dreaming on such a winter's day

[Outro]
California dreaming on such a winter's day

[repeat until fade]

[Verse 1]
Do you ever get the feeling that you got to get away
It's a symptom of the fever all across the u.s.a
My family doctor told me "son the flu is what you have"
But i know it's island fever and i got it real bad

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey doc i need a pain reliever
(Oooo i got it bad) i got the island fever
I got it bad i got the island fever
(Oooo i got it bad) i got the island fever
My baby caught it and i'm not quite sure how
(Oooo i got it bad) i got the island fever
She might have got it from her travel brochure now
(Oooo i got it bad)

[Chorus]
(Bow bow bow ooo)
Come on baby wouldn't it be nice (bow bow bow ooo)
If i could take you down to paradise (bow bow bow ooo)
Sweet little mama gotta get away (bow bow bow ooo)
Your daddy knows a little hideaway (bow bow bow ooo)

[Verse 2]
Hey girl i got some good advice
Drive your dad mad and
Make him take you down to paradise

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been picking up a love vibration
(Oooo i got it bad) i got the island fever
Coming from a little island nation
(Oooo i got it bad) i got the island fever
For my own self-preservation
(Oooo i got it bad) i got the island fever
Better make a quick reservation
(Oooo i got it bad)

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Hey girl i got some good advice
Drive your dad mad and
Make him take you down to paradise

[Chorus]

[Chorus 1]
Doot doot doot-doot doot

[x4]

[Verse 1]
Well she first caught my eye a-running round in shorts
But she never bothered with her hair
Just a barefooted chick with skinned up knees
Yeah she didn't care what she'd wear
(All dressed up for school)

[Chorus 2]
Dressed up for school, ooo what a turn on

[x3]
All dressed up for school

[Verse 2]
All summer long she had a crush on me
But I just couldn't care at all
But new to school threads really did it for me
Yeah she's turned into a doll
(All dressed up for school)

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 3]
Goes out every night because she's a sharp little doll
And the guys can't leave her alone
Now she hardly finds the time to talk to me
She's not the little girl I've always known
(All dressed up for school)

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 1]
Hold on dear Brother

[x3]
Oh Brother
Ooooo

[Verse 1]
Tried to close my eyes
To all around me
Oh no you just can't escape
If I lose one friend
Will I still have you

[Chorus 2]
Won't you please
Hold on dear Brother
Hold on dear Brother
Hold on dear Brother
Oh Brother
Ooooo

[Verse 2]
What can I love that isn't you
But you never understand inside of me
Till you realize a look
You never get more than you took

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3] 

[x2]
In your heart you know it love
A simple feeling that you shout
I want your love
You touch my hand
I need your love
To carry me home

[Chorus 1]
Hold on dear Brother

[x9]

[Intro]
Look at me
Funny face
That's not you
A wrinkled nose
A tear
You're crying

[Verse]
Rest your head
Cry on me
Don't be afraid
I'll stay with you
I know you'll make it

[Bridge]
And you'll make it good
And you'll make it good
And you'll make it good

[Outro]
All of my life
I haven't known much
All I know
Is what I feel
And what I feel
And what I feel
Love
I'm in love
Love
Love

[Verse 1]
He used to ride the sidewalks in a landlocked town
A solitary surfer still he got around
He had his favorite spots now
Where the best rides could be found
With posters on his wall from "surfer" magazine
His room looked like a shrine to the surfing scene
Go to hawaii out of high school was his big time college dream
(That's where the girls are)
Did you ever wonder what happened to surfer joe
He up and took a trawler down to mexico
With a pretty senorita we both used to know
You can see him catch a wave in the morning light
And sometimes you can find him on his board at night
A silouette on water as the sun dips outta sight

[Chorus]
He's still surfing
(Still surfing)
He's still surfing
(Still surfing)
You'll catch him on a wave on his way to class
Then be back there after school on his daylight glass
He's still surfing
(Still surfing)
He's still surfing
(Still surfing)
Surfers always love them summer days
With a board in the water rolling with the waves
He's still surfing

[Verse 2]
He's always been a surfer since the early days
Spending the summer searching for that perfect wave
He and his surfing senorita never seem to age
He doesn't do a whole lot with his law degree
They thought about a major oceanography
But he does a lot of thinking about how to save the sea
(That's where the waves are)
Things up north were getting kinda out of hand
So he got a break to see the ride on the sand
With his little mama seated in a surfer's never never land
You can see him catch a wave in the morning light
And sometimes you can find him on his board at night
A silhouette on water as the sun dips outta sight

[Chorus]

[Outro]
In the morning light he still surfing
On his board at night he's still surfing
In the summer days he's still surfing
Rolling with the waves he's still surfing

[Intro]
Break break shake away
Break breakaway
Now I'm free to do what I want to do

[Verse 1]
Time will not wait for me
Time is my destiny
Why change the part of me that has to be free
The love that passed me by
I found no reason why
But now each day is filled with the love
That very same love
That passed me by
And that is why
I can breakaway from that lonely life
And I can do what I want to do
And breakaway from that empty life
And my world is new
When I laid down on my bed
I heard voices in my head
Telling me now "Hey it's only a dream"
The more I thought of it
I had been out of it
And here's the answer I found instead

[Bridge]

[x3]
(Baby baby)
Found out it was in my head

[Verse 2]
And I can breakaway to the better life
Where the shackles never hold me down
I'm going to make a way for each happy day
As my life turns around

[Bridge]

[x2]
Come on we're free to breakaway
(Oh boy you jump for joy)
Now won't you come on
(When you breakaway)
You're free to breakaways
(Breakaway)

[Outro]

[x2]
Feel the vibrations
In all the sensations
Breakaway

[Chorus]
I am that, thou art that, and all this is that
I am that, thou art that, and all this is that
I am that, thou art that, and all this is that
I am that, thou art that, and all this is that
This is that
Oooo

[Verse 1]
Daybreak and I take a glide
Into the pool of peace inside
(Two ways travel by)
Two ways and I both travel by
(And that makes all the difference to me)
Life supporting waves of bliss
Mother Divine's precious kiss
Brings with love the light of wisdom
And the gift of eternal freedom
Two ways and I both travel by
(... and the nature of man...)
And that makes all the difference to me
(Krishna...)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Dusk time the shadows fall
Into the timeless time of all
Two ways and I both travel by
Golden auras glow around you
Omnipresent love surrounds you
Wisdom warming as the sun
You and I are truly one
Two ways and I both travel by
And that makes all the difference to me

[Chorus] 

[x2]

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I'll set the stage while she's still dancing
I'll make the music soft and slow
Then i'll turn down the lights
Make things just right
For every slow song that we know

[Chorus]
Over and over again
One summer night
(Do do do)
We fell in love
One summer night
I held you tight

You and i

Under the moon for love

We'll spin around this room together
I'll treat my angel really nice
We'll fall in love, we'll fall forever
Thank god for lazy summer nights

[Chorus]
Over and over again
One summer night
(Do do do)
(One summer, one summer)
I kissed your lips

Making love to wake
To find

She believes in god
And karma too
Paranormal powers
You know some people do

Tell you what's in your stars
She was down in rio
Turn the heads of state
Got them into making
This planet a better place
On copacabana
Uh huh
Oh yeah she radiate better go meditate

[Chorus]
Every-time i touch my baby
Strange things happen
Strange things happen
Everytime i touch my baby
Strange things happen to me
Strange things happen
Oh ohhh ohhhh

Every-time i touch my baby
Strange things happen to me

[Verse 2]
Met a psychic reader
With a crystal ball
Had a vision
Said we could have it all
I caught her gazing
Uh huh
At our destiny cosmically

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Strange strange strange strange strange strange strange strange strange
Strange strange strange strange strange strange strange strange strange
Strange strange strange 

[x2]
Strange strange strange strange strange strange strange strange strange
Strange strange strange strange strange

[Verse 1]
Seems like the other day
My baby went away
She went away across the sea
It's been two years or so
Since i saw my baby go
And then this letter came for me
Oh it said that we were through
She's found somebody new
Oh baby's gone what can i do

[Chorus]
(Remember)
Hey i remember
("Walking in the sand")
"Walking in the sand"
(Remember remember)
("Walking in the sand")
Walking hand in hand
("Walking in the sand")
"Walking in the sand"
(Remember remember)
("Walking in the sand")
Walking hand in hand
("Walking in the sand")

[Verse 2]
I want to know
What ever happened to
The little girl i once knew
She said that she'd be true

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Remember
Remember
"Walking in the sand" 

[X4]

[Verse 1]
There's a time a for joy
A time for tears
A time we'll treasure through the years

[Chorus]
We'll remember always
Graduation day

[Verse 2]
At the senior prom
We danced till three
And there you gave your heart to me

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Though we leave in sorrow
All the joys we've known
We can face tomorrow
Knowing we'll never walk alone

[Verse 3]
When the ivy walks
Are far behind
No matter where our paths may wind

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
Teenage gamblers
Sitting in a Rambler
Listening to the radio
And then standing in the grandstand
Following the gameplan
Watching life's plays unfold
You fell in love with a pretty cheerleader
I even married one
And we once rode a cab out in Salt Lake City
Coming up with "Fun Fun Fun"
(Fun fun fun)

[Chorus]
They say that Brian is back
Well I've known him for oh so long
They say Brian is back
Well I never knew that he was gone
Still they say "Brian is back"
I know he's had his ups and downs
Well they say "Brian is back"
But in my heart he's always been around

[Verse 2]
I still remember
His sounding sweet and tender
Singing "Danny Boy" on Grandma's lap
And those harmony highs
Could bring tears to my eyes
I guess I'm just a sentimental sap
"Good Vibrations" caused such a sensation
Not to mention old Pet Sounds
And we travelled the world
As the banners unfurled
I guess you'd have to say we got around
(We got around we got around)

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Oooooh, oo-oo-oo-ooh
Aaaaah
Been too long

Oooooh, oo-oo-oo-ooh
Aaaaah
I miss you darling, I miss you so hard

I miss you darling, I miss you so hard
Miss you so hard now
Miss you darling
Come back baby and don’t break my heart
How it goes
And I’m alone, lying down, looking up the stars
Reliving the times we shared when the moon, the stars and the music was ours

Been way too long, been way too long baby
Way too long, I’ve been way too long baby
Way too long, I can't wait too long baby
Way too long, I can't wait too long baby
Way too long, I can't wait too long baby
Way too long, been way too long baby
Way too long, can't wait too long baby
Way too long, I can't wait too long baby
Baby you know that I can't wait forever
(I’ve been way too long, been way too long baby)
Awoke in the night again we were together
(Way too long, I can't wait too long baby)
Windows of darkness are all I can see through
(Way too long, I’ve been way too long baby)
Searching the shadows, hoping to see you
(Way too long, I’ve been way too long baby)

Baby you know that I can't wait forever
(Way too long, I’ve been way too long baby)
Awoke in the night again we were together
(Way too long, I’ve been way too long baby)
Baby you know that I
(Way too long, I’ve been way too long baby)
(Way too long, I can't wait too long baby)

[Intro]
Hello

[Verse 1]
My luck was so bad
I thought I used up all the luck I had
Everytime I thought I'd get it on
Someone put me on
There's been a change
Beautiful and strange
My life's gone through a change
Somehow I know (somehow I know)
Bad luck's in the past
All good things here at last
So now we'll grow

[Pre-Chorus]
There's been a change
Mmmmm
Bad luck (no more)
No bad luck (no more)

[x3]
I got news for you

[Chorus]

[x3]
There ain't no blues
I got news for you
No bad luck (no more)

[x3]
I got news for you

[Outro]
Listen to the boys loud and clear
Come on folks withstand you fears
Sail away the choice is yours you choose
Celebrate the news
There ain't no blues
Come on, come on, come on

[repeat until fade]

[Verse]
The way I act don't seem like me
I'm not on top like I used to be
I'll give in when I know I should be strong
I still give in even though I know it's wrong, know it's wrong
I guess I'm dumb but I don't care
And breaking off wasn't hard to do
But I couldn't stay away from you
I feel love but not the way I did before
This time girl, has got to be forever more, ever more
I guess I'm dumb but I don't care
And baby since we've been apart
Maybe I've found I had a heart
I couldn't let go even if I wanted to
You must know baby now it's only you, only you
I guess I'm dumb but I don't care

[Outro]
(Guess I'm dumb)

[repeat until fade]

[Intro]
Go like this
All right, knock it off
Cindy, Oh Cindy
Bye Mom
One-two, a one-two-three

[Verse 1]
I joined the Navy to see the world
But nowhere could I find
A girl as sweet as Cindy
The girl I left behind
I've searched the wide world over
Can't get her out of my mind

[Chorus]
Cindy, oh Cindy
(C-Cindy, C-Cindy)
Cindy don't let me down
(C-Cindy, C-Cindy)
Write me a letter, dear
(C-Cindy, C-Cindy)
And I'll be homeward bound
(C-Cindy, C-Cindy)

[Verse 2]
I see her face in every wave
Her lips kiss every breeze
Her loving arms reach out to me
Through calm and stormy sea
At night I face the lonely day
Caressed by memories

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I know my Cindy's waiting for me
As I walk the decks alone
Her loving arms reach out to me
Soon I'll be heading home
Then my sailing days will be over
No more will I roam

[Chorus]

[Outro]
(C-Cindy, C-Cindy)

[repeat until fade]

[Verse 1: The Beach Boys]
I know so many people who think they can do it alone
They isolate their heads and stay in their safety zones
Now what can you tell them
And what can you say that won't make them defensive

[Chorus 1: The Beach Boys]
Hang on to your ego
Hang on, but I know that you're gonna lose the fight

[Verse 2: The Beach Boys]
They come on like they're peaceful
But inside they're so uptight
They trip through the day
And waste all their thoughts at night

[Chorus 2: The Beach Boys]
Now how can I say it
And how can I come on
When I know I'm guilty

[Chorus 1: The Beach Boys]
Hang on to your ego
Hang on, but I know that you're gonna lose the fight

[Chorus 2: The Beach Boys]
Now how can I say it
And how can I come on
When I know I'm guilty

[Chorus 1: The Beach Boys]
Hang on to your ego
Hang on, but I know that you're gonna lose the fight

[Outro: Brian Wilson's dog, Marylin Wilson, Brian Wilson & Chuck Britz]
(Bark)
Hey Chuck is it possible we could bring a horse in here without, if we
Don't screw anything up
I beg your pardon
Honest to God, now, the horse is tamed and everything

[Verse 1]
Well I've gone steady with a-lots of girls
And to all of them I tried to be true
But I'm so glad I never promised them
What I promised you

[Chorus]
And that's I do (I do, yes I do)
Take you (take you, I'll take you)
For my wife (for my, for my wife)
For the rest of my life (ah yes the rest of my life)

[Verse 2]
Well I heard from my folks
Time and time again
To make sure that I found the right one
And every time you meet
Your heart will beat
And you'll want to say

[Chorus]

[x5]

[Verse 1]
Where the sea breeze
Sways the palm trees
Paradise awaits
And so does she
Reliving love
That was like a romance
From a page in history

It was the last place
That he stopped at
On the way back to his boat
She was dancing
Met his glancing
Like they say
"It was all she wrote"

[Chorus]
You know i want to
But i can't stay (bye bye)
Girl you know i'm gonna sail away (sail away)
When the wind comes up
And when the sun goes down
I'll say "goodbye" to this old island town
Out on the water where the full moon shines
You and lahaina always on my mind

[Verse 2]
They left the dance floor
So they could spend more
Precious time near the water side
It wasn't wrong
And it wasn't right
They were two ships
Passing in the night

[Chorus]
You know i want to
But i can't stay (bye bye)
Girl you know i'm gonna sail away (sail away)
When the wind comes up
And when the sun goes down
I'll say "goodbye" to this old island town
I think about you when the full moon shines
Lahaina always on my mind 

[x3]

[Chorus]
Ooooooooow
Livin' down in L.A
Such A Beautiful day
Whoa whoa

[x2]

[Verse 1]
The skies are clear
It's a beautiful day in L.A
People in motion
Our wheels moving all kind a ways
Indoors, outdoors, in the sun
There are people everywhere having fun, fun, fun
And when the moon and stars come out at night
We'll know what to do when we turn out the lights
(turn out the lights, out the lights)
The freeways there are jammed with all kind of folks on their bikes
With fastball surfers, they're all doing their lefts and their rights
Roller skating, jogging, or a fancy bike
You can get around most anyway you really like
And when the sun is down and the stars are bright
I can hardly wait to get to hold you tight
(hold you tight, hold you tight)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Riding the fastlanes, and ballet in leisurely flight
People in motion the streets there a beautiful sight
In good times, sunshine, you'll feel alright
We'll maybe even do an afternoon delight
You're sure to get as high as the clouds above
Participating in this little dance of love (dance of love, dance of love)

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
The freeways are jammed now
The cars have disappeared from the scene
Because gone to work or to play
They use a whole another kind of machine

[Chorus]

[Intro]
Boardwalk (i wanna take you girl under the)
Boardwalk (i'm gonna take you girl under the)
Boardwalk (i wanna take you girl under the)
Boardwalk

[Verse 1]
Ah when the sun beats down and burns the tar up on the roof
And the street's so hot you're hoping this whole town is fireproof

[Chorus]
Under the boardwalk
Down by the sea (oh yeah)
I'm on a blanket with my baby
That's where i'll be

[Verse 2]
And when the sun goes down
We'll take a walk along the strand
And as the tide goes out
We'll write "i love you" right there in the sand

[Chorus]
Oh i want to go
Under the boardwalk
Down by the sea (oh yeah)
I'm on a blanket with my baby
That's where i'll be

Under the boardwalk
Under the boardwalk

[Chorus]
Oh oh ohhhh
Under the boardwalk (yeah)
Down by the sea (oh yeah)
I'm on a blanket with my baby
That's where i'll be

[Verse 3]
And when the moon is out
And it's finally cooling down
Don't have to look too far
Because my girl and i just might be found

[Chorus]
Oh oh ohhhh
Under the boardwalk (yeah)
Down by the sea (oh yeah)
On a blanket with my baby
That's where i'll be
Ooo i'm on a blanket with my pretty baby
Just you and me

[Outro]
Boardwalk (i wanna take you girl under the)
Boardwalk (i'm gonna take you girl under the) 

[x2]
Boardwalk (i wanna take you girl under)

[Verse 1]
Way back when well our master plan
Was havin' fun fun fun as america's band
Well we came out rockin' with rhonda and barbara ann
Singin' of surf and sand
Now when we look back over all the fun we had
If our lifestyle's over now it sure is sad
We gotta get back to livin' without a care
Give me sunshine water and an ozone layer
Paradise is a state of mind
Where mother nature nurtures and man is kind
We need a change now wouldn't it be nice
If we could bring back summer
Get us back our summer
Summer in paradise

[Chorus]
(Paradise)
Summer in paradise (paradise)
Summer in paradise (paradise)
Summer in paradise
They chop down the forests
And in their haste leave a trail of destruction
And toxic waste is leaving no one safe
In their home or their habitat
Can't let it go like that
Too much consumption and too much greed
When you consider all the people
That are living in need
Interdependence in this world is a natural fact
And we're all under attack
It's the eve of destruction or so they say
But mankind doesn't have to go that way
If we all get together we can make things right
And we can bring back summer
Get us back our summer
Summer in paradise

[Chorus]
(Paradise)
Summer in paradise (paradise)
Summer in paradise (paradise)
Summer in paradise

[Verse 3]
Surfers recycle now don't you know
Like everyone from california to kokomo
We're gonna keep on rocking
And raising world consciousness
We gotta fix this mess
Looked in the future and what i saw
Was a world in harmony with natural law
There's trouble now but it will be alright if we can
Bring back summer
Get us back our summer
Summer in paradise

[Chorus]
(Paradise)
Summer in paradise (paradise)
Summer in paradise (paradise)
Summer in paradise (paradise)
Summer in paradise

[Outro]
(Paradise)
Summer in paradise (paradise)
Summer in paradise 

[x3]

[Intro]
Oh Judy, do you hear me call your name
Oh Judy, do you really feel the same
Oh Judy, if I were you I'd take the blame

[Verse]
Judy, it's getting stronger every day
Oh Judy, I felt it's you in every way
My Judy, that's why you're always here to stay

[Bridge]
I love you so
I want you to know
I can't let you
Give me a chance to show

[Chorus]

[x2]
Judy, I smell love's perfume in the air
Oh Judy, I know my love will never wear
Then Judy, tell me that you really care

[Verse]
I've been overseas for almost a year
Any time now precious land should appear
I've been away from my lover so long
Look there matey, but I could be wrong

[Chorus 1]
Oh land ahoy, land ahoy, sailor boy
(Land ahoy land ahoy Papa's toy l'ahoy)
Oh land ahoy, land ahoy, sailor boy
(Land ahoy land ahoy Papa's toy l'ahoy)
Oh land ahoy, land ahoy, sailor boy
(Land ahoy land ahoy Papa's toy l'ahoy)
Oh land ahoy, land ahoy, sailor boy
(Land ahoy land ahoy Papa's toy l'ahoy)

[Chorus 2]
Listen here matey, in an hour or so
We'll be sitting on the land that we know
We'll leave this ship and run to outstretched arms
And soon we'll be living with our lover's charms

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

Giddy up

[Verse 1]
Well I'm a long tall Texan
I ride a big white horse
(He rides from Texas on a big white horse)
Well I'm a long tall Texan
I ride a big white horse
(He rides from Texas on a big white horse)
Well people look at me and say
Hurrah hurrah is that your horse?
(He rides from Texas on a big white horse)
Yeah
Well I'm a long tall Texan
I wear a ten gallon hat

Well I'm a long tall Texan

Well people look at me and say

[Bridge]
Well I was walking down the street
With my shining badge
My spurs jingling down at my feet
I seen a man a coming
Coming with a gun
And I just can't be beat

[Verse 2]
Well I'm a long tall Texan
I enforce justice for the law
(He rides from Texas to enforce the law)
Well I'm a long tall Texan
I enforce justice for the law
(He rides from Texas to enforce the law)
Well people look at me and say
Hurrah hurrah are you the law?
(He rides from Texas to enforce the law)

[Verse 1]
We don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee
We don't take our trips on LSD
We don't burn our draft cards down on Main Street
Because we like living right, and being free
We don't make a party out of loving
That's because we like holding hands and pitching woo
We don't let our hair grow long and shaggy
Like the hippies out in San Francisco do

[Chorus]
I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee
A place where even squares can have a ball
We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse
And white lightning's still the biggest thrill of all

[Verse 2]
Leather boots are still in style for manly footwear
Beads and Roman sandals won't be seen
Football's still the roughest thing on campus
And the kids there still respect the college dean

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Outro]
White lightning's still the biggest thrill of all
In Muskogee, Oklahoma, USA

[Verse 1]
On Santa Monica city pier
We watch the people who gather here
The uninvited who've lost their way
And now we're all here to stay

[Chorus 1]
And it's a strange world
There's nothing to it
Strange world
I'm getting through it
Strange world
Thinking it over
It's a strange world after all

[Verse 2]
Multi-colourful lives we run
To catch a glimpse of the setting sun
I can't imagine how life would be
If you were not here with me

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3]
Sunday morning
Skies so blue
Yo te amo
Means I love you

You can drive your car
To the county fair
Or ride your bicycle anywhere
It doesn't matter that much to me
Cause we're pretty good company

[Chorus 1]

[Verse]
Get a breath of that country air
Breathe the beauty of it everywhere
Get a look at that clear blue sky
Come on
Get a breath of that country air
Breathe the beauty of it everywhere
Mother Nature she fills my eyes
Get a breath of that country air
Breathe the beauty of it everywhere
Rise up early the day won't let you sleep

[Outro]
Ahahh-haaaa
Ahahh-haaaa
Ahahh-haaaa

[Verse 1]
When I see my baby
When I see my little girl
When I see my woman
I'm gonna tell her about the lonely hours I just spent
And say the thing we got going hope it never ends
Well I'm gonna tell that little girl a thing or two

[Chorus]
Do it right baby
(Do it right baby)
Ahhh haaa
Outta sight baby
Ahhh-ha ha
Do it right baby
(Do it right baby)
Ahhh haaa

[Verse 2]
When I see my baby
When I look in her pretty eyes
When I get with my darling baby
I say my heart will start to beat like a couple of drums
She'll get my temperature to rise to 'bout a hundred and one

[Chorus]
Do it right baby
(Do it right baby)
Ahhh haaa
Outta sight baby
Ahhh-ha ha
Do it right baby
(Do it right baby)
Ahhh haaa

[Verse 3]
A whole day away from your woman
A separation from your girl can really mess your mind
And can you dig this one thing
Well it's lucky I'm working from nine to five
I have to live with my doctors just to keep me alive
Keep on telling a thing or two

[Chorus]
Do it right baby
(Do it right baby)
Ahhh haaa
Outta sight baby
Ahhh-ha ha
Do it right baby
(Do it right baby)
Ahhh haaa

[Verse 1]
It looks like rain and it's been coming on for hours
It looks like rain I hear the rumble of thunder showers
Pretty soon the rain will play its sweet refrain
While we listen from inside
And until it stops, we'll hear the drips and drops
From beside the fireside

[Pre-Chorus]
So let it rain (pitter patter, pitter patter of the rain) (going drip
Drop drip drop)
Yeah and we'll be happy when it stops (pitter patter, pitter patter of
The rain) (going drip drop drip drop)
'Cause when it rains (pitter patter, pitter patter of the rain) (going
Drip drop drip drop)
The ways of love rise in my heart (pitter patter, pitter patter of the
Rain) (going drip drop drip drop)
We won't be sad when there is a storm (ooooo)
And we can be glad (ooooo)
'Cause we can keep warm, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Listen to the rain
Pitter patter, pitter patter of the rain (going drip drop drip drop)
Pitter patter, pitter patter, pitter patter (going drip drop drip drop)
Pitter patter oooo

[Verse 2]
A rain swept plain
Soon after springtime rains blow over
Will sprout new grain
And miles of fresh green fields of clover
Winter and its cold soon will lose its hold
With the changes spring will bring
Sun comes pouring down warming up the ground
Bringing new life with the spring

[Pre-Chorus]
So let it rain (pitter patter, pitter patter of the rain) (going drip
Drop drip drop)
Yeah and we'll be happy when it stops (pitter patter, pitter patter of
The rain) (going drip drop drip drop)
'Cause when it rains (pitter patter, pitter patter of the rain) (going
Drip drop drip drop)
The ways of love rise in my heart (pitter patter, pitter patter of the
Rain) (going drip drop drip drop)
And like the rising tides love is growing stronger (ooooo)
Let's ride out the storm just a little bit longer yeah (ooooo)

[Chorus]

[x5]

[Intro]
Oh darling
Ooh, my darling, you're so fine
Ohhhh-ahhh-ahhh

[Verse 1]
Don't know if words could say
But darling, I'll find a way
To let you know what you meant to me
Guess it was meant to be
I hold you in my heart
As life's most precious part

[Chorus]
Oh darling (oh darling)
I dream about you often my pretty darling
(My darling, you're so fine)
I love the way you soften my life with your love
Your precious love
Uh huh, oh

[Verse 2]
I was living like half a man
Then I couldn't love, but now I can
You pick me up when I'm feeling sad
More soul than I ever had
Gonna love you every single night
Cause I think you're too outta sight

[Chorus]
Oh darling (oh darling)
I dream about you often my pretty darling
(My darling, you're so fine)
I love the way you soften my life with your love
Your precious love
Uh huh huh

[Bridge]
Woah, oh, oh, oh
Every night, oh darling

[Verse 3]
Gonna love you every single night, yes I will
Cause I think you're too doggone outta sight

[Chorus]
Oh darling (oh darling)
I dream about you often my pretty darling
(My darling, you're so fine)
I love the way you soften my life with your love
Your precious love
Uh huh, oh

[Verse]
I'm doing this and I'm doing that
And I'm a-walking the floor
I drink a little of this and eat a little that
And poke my head out the door
I get thinking I'm wasting the night away
I wouldn't mind if I could get with you right away
Oh honey don't know how long it's been
But this feeling's building up inside again
I wash the dishes and I rinsed up the sink
Like a busy bee
I make up a song as I'm a-working along
No one's watching me
I wish that you were here to help me dry
When's the last time you baked me a pie
You had a way of making it come alive
It's not too late for you to take a drive

[Bridge]
(Baah ba ba ba baah ba ba)
(Baah ba ba ba baah ba ba)

[Outro]
It's not too late
I'd love just once to see you
I'd love just once to see you
I'd love just once to see you
In the nude

[Verse]
Now that I have lost my Diane
There's no plan as to where to go
It was hard to lose my Diane
Now I just miss her so
Everything is old and nothing is new
All I ever do is think of you
Memories haunt me night and day
(Ahhhhhhhhhhh)
Do you think of me, my Diane
Or have you forgotten me?
Did you think that you were chained down
And now that you are free

[Outro]
Everything is wrong and nothing is right
I want you back with all of my might
Shadows hanging over my head
I love you Diane I miss you Diane
Everything is wrong and nothing is right
I want you back with all of my might
Everything is wrong and nothing is right
I want you back with all of my might
Everything is wrong and nothing is right
I want you back with all of my might
Everything is wrong and nothing is right
I want you back with all of my might

[Verse]
It's been a long, long while
Since we've been strung out on love
And there's no mask of a smile
That can hide what we're thinkin' of
From your heart I hear
Only distant echoes of empty love
I guess this must be the matchpoint of our love
Early in the game when you broke me
Just like a serve (matchpoint matchpoint)
We shoulda walked off the court
But we both didn't have the nerve (matchpoint matchpoint)
So we volleyed a while with small talk
And a smile and as push comes to shove
I'd say this must be the matchpoint of our love

[Bridge]
No one ever held me the way you did
No one could ever love me the way you did
How could love slip away from me?

[Outro]
In life's lonely game love too often
Can let you down (matchpoint matchpoint)
And tho' no one's to blame
Love is stil the only game in town (matchpoint matchpoint)
When it's love's last play you can only say by the stars above That this
Must be the match point of our love
Da da da, da da da da da da (matchpoint matcpoint)
Da da da da da, da da da da da da (matchpoint matchpoint)
Da da da da da, da da da da da da (matchpoint matchpoint)
Da da da da da, da da da da da da (matchpoint matchpoint)

[Verse]
Why don't you run away and spend some time with me
On this summer's day, there's nowhere else I'd rather be
Why don't we feel the way we used to anymore
There's a place along the way, that maybe we could stay
And listen to the waves at my front door

You've been thinking 'bout some things we used to do
Thinking 'bout when life was still in front of you
Back where you belong, our favorite song
Won't you listen

Don't you understand the words
Are singing in the wind
I wish that we could get from there to back again

The clouds are breaking, it's a beautiful day
For a wonderful, Pacific coast getaway
The sun is shining, could we just find a way
I you just call, just fall, just fall
To the ground
Through our compromise, paradise
Is just another place up on the wall
Through the common sense of it all
We had a lot to live, we gave it all
Through the consequence of the wine
Another place in time

[Verse]
Winds of change blow 'round my door
Is this the year I've been waiting for?
Worlds in motion endlessly
Cosmic ocean flows into my heart
Part of me would like to be (would like to be)
A shining lighthouse for all to see (for all to see)
When the dark night hides the sun
Shine a light for everyone to see
Isn't that the way it should be?
I am no stranger to a world of change
There are always situations to rearrange
But there's something special 'bout this quiet dawn
It seems to sing a song to everyone
It's dawning on and on and on
Of change are here at last (are here at last)
The clouds have lifted, the storm has passed (the storm has passed)

[Outro]
Nights we've known are on the run
And there's a bright and shining sun
For everyone to see
Winds of change
(Won't last forever)
(Won't last forever)
(Won't last forever)

[Verse 1]
Let the wind blow
Let the grass grow
But don't let her go

[Chorus]
Don't take her out of my life
Don't take her out of my life

[Verse 2]
Let the moon glow
(Let the moon glow on the fallen snow)
On the fallen snow
(Let the moon glow on the fallen snow)
But I just got to know
(Let me please know, oh oh oh)

[Chorus]
Know she'll be a part of my life
Know she'll be a part of my life
Forever

[Bridge]
Let the bees make honey
Let the poor find money
Take away their sorrows
Give them sunshine tomorrow
But don't take her out of my life
Don't take her out of my life
What would I do without her, tell me now

[Verse 3]
Let the birds sing
With the coming spring
Let the church bells ring
Let the rain fall
Let the grass grow
Let the moon glow
On the fallen snow

[Chorus]
But don't take her out of my life
Please keep her a part of my life
Sometimes I realize my days are getting on
Sometimes I realize it's time to move along
And I wanna go home

Sunlight's fading and there's not much left to say
My life, I'm better off alone
My life, I'm better on my own

Driving down Pacific Coast, out on Highway One
The setting sun
Goodbye

[Verse 1]
After it's all been said
The music spinning in our head
Can't forget the feeling of
The magic of that summer in love
Ooh, I wanna take you there
Do you wanna turn back the pages
Memories and photographs
The world has changed
And yet the game
Is still the same

[Chorus]
Isn't it time we danced the night away
How about doing it just like yesterday?
Every time I think of you
And all of those things we used to do

Remember those nights we spent just you and I
Little did we know how the time would fly
Isn't it time, oh-oh-oh
Isn't it time
Whoa

[Verse 2]
The good times never have to end
And now's the time to let them happen again
And we can have ourselves a blast
The good times they, aren't only in the past

[Chorus]
Isn't it time we danced the night away
How about doing it just like yesterday?
Every time I think of you
And all of those things we used to do

Remember those nights we spent just you and I
Little did we know how the time would fly
Isn't it time, oh-oh-oh
Isn't it time
Whoa

[Bridge]
And as the sun goes down
We raise our glass to kindness
To all the good times we shared
Isn't it time we get ready and then
Isn't it time we go steady again

[Chorus]
Isn't it time we danced the night away
How about doing it just like yesterday?
Every time I think of you
And all of those things we used to do
Remember those nights we spent just you and I
Little did we know how the time would fly
Isn't it time, oh-oh-oh
Isn't it time


Isn't it time we danced the night away
How about doing it just like yesterday?
Every time I think of you
And all of those things we used to do

Remember those nights we spent just you and I
Little did we know how the time would fly
Isn't it time

[Verse 1]
Driving around, living the dream
I'm cruising the town, I'm digging the scene
I'm not gonna stress, not going to worry
Doing our best, no need to hurry
Looking ahead with anticipation
Making each day a new celebration
Seems like it could go on forever
As long as we can all stay together
We used to get around
Get up and hit up all the hot spots in town

[Chorus 1]
Spring vacation, good vibrations
Summer weather, we're back together
Easy money, ain't life funny?
Hey, what's it to ya?
Hallelujah

[Verse 2]
As for the past, that's all behind us
Happier now, look what life finds us
Singing our songs is enough reason
Harmony boys is what we believe in
Some said it wouldn't last
All we can say is we're still having a blast

[Chorus 2]
Spring vacation, good vibrations
Summer weather, we're back together
Easy money, ain't life funny?
Hey, what's it to ya?
Hallelujah

[Brdige]
Every night's a special occasion

[Chorus 3]
Spring vacation, good vibrations
Summer weather, we're back together
Easy money, ain't life funny?
Hey, what's it to ya?
Hallelujah

[Verse 1]
The private life of Bill and Sue
Can you dig what I'm telling you?
No one knows just why we care
We see their faces everywhere

[Chorus 1]
The strangest story you ever knew
The private life of Bill and Sue

[Chorus 2]
From California to Mexico
Everybody's just got to know
Dallas Texas to Monterey
Wasting time on a sunny day

[Chorus 3]
Santa Barbara to Jersey Shore
At the line in the grocery store
Everybody who ever knew
The private life of Bill and Sue

[Verse 2]
The private life of Bill and Sue
The world is wondering what they do
We watch them on our TV screen
Their lives are like a movie scene

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

[Verse 3]
Sometimes life can be so strange
Maybe we're just looking for a change

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 1]
Did you ever listen with the music missing
Turn your radio on
When the trees are swaying and the band is playing
Our favorite song

Shelter from the sunlight
Shelter from the cold night

[Chorus 1]
Just where I wanna be
Baby just you and me
Staying at home

[Chorus 2]
Summertime, take a few calls, make a little love
Thank God for shelter

[Chorus 3]
I'll give you shelter from the storm
And a house to keep you warm
I'll give you shelter through the night
And a chance to make this right

[Chorus 4]
Do you ever still think of me
And the way that we used to be
When the world was just you and me
Hanging out in our shelter

[Verse 2]
Now it's two o'clock
Lines around the block
Waiting for the parade
When the dark of night
Or the bright sunlight
Has you runnin' for shade

Together we can run and hide
Maybe we can stay inside

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

[Chorus 4]

[Outro]
Do you think that you'd ever stay
Take a page out of yesterday
If we could only find a way
Hanging out in our shelter

[Verse 1]
Bring back, bring back my baby
Daybreak over the ocean
Moonlight still on the sea
I pray the waves gentle motion
Bring my my baby back to me?
And the stars sprinkle the morning
Venus fades form my sight
Will my love be returning
Like the Sun to brightening over my life?

[Chorus 1]
Days break over the ocean
Moonlight still on the sea
I pray the waves gentle motion
Bring my my baby back to me?
Bring it back
Oh, bring it back
Bring my back my baby

[Verse 2]
Darling, if you could only
Hear this song in my heart
Then you will know why you need, never feel lonely
We'll soon be together, never to depart
And as long as there is an ocean
Long as stars are to shine
Baby you will always have my devotion, have my devotion
I'll love you pretty baby
Till then end of time

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3]
As long as there is an ocean
Moonlight still on the sea
I pray the waves gentle motion
Will bring my baby to me

Darling if you should ever
Wonder what you should do
Baby you should know I'll love you forever
Maybe little darling that will see you through
And as the sunset set over the ocean
And the world fades from you
Baby always knew my love and devotion
Will bright up the night
Because I love you

[Outro]
Bring back, bring back
Bring it back
Bring back my baby
Won't you?
Bring back, bring back
Bring it back
Bring back my baby
Won't you bring back my baby?

[Chorus 1]
We got beaches in mind
Man it's been too much time

[Verse 1]
Woke me up before dawn
Wish I could sleep some more so I could carry on
With the dream I've been meaning to make come true
And that's to get away with you
I think we all can agree
That there's no better place for us to be
We can drive on for miles till we're finally free
It'll just be you and me

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 1]
South bay surfing again
Haven't been this way in I don't know when
If I have my say we'll be back again
Where the good times never end
We got beaches in mind
Man, it's been too much time
Not a care in the world is where I want to be
With the surfers, sand and the sea
We'll find the place in the sun
Where everyone can have fun, fun fun

[Chorus 1]

[x2]

[Verse 1]
Oh, we were strangers in a really big city
Got excited by the sound of a party
Now my heart beat while the music was grooving
And if you wanted to, you couldn't keep from moving
Look around, do you believe what you seeing
The walls are moving, the ceiling's a-reeling

[Verse 2]
Couples over in the corner romancing
Oh, the boys are witness some outta sight dancing
Gotta girl giving me some lessons
And now she's gonna be my obsession
Aren't you glad we found our way in here
Put another record up on the player

[Verse 3]
Hey, there's a stoned party dancing with the police
Don't have to worry about disturbing the peace
Met a fine chick that really got to me
Good Lord, how she boogalooed to me
Oh my, how she boogalooed it to me
Come on, sock it, sock it to me
S-O-C-K-I-T to me

[Chorus 1]
Summer’s gone
Summer’s gone away
Gone away
With yesterday

[Verse 1]
Old friends have gone
They’ve gone their separate ways
Our dreams hold on
For those who still have more to say

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2]
The nights grow cold
It’s time to go
I’m thinking maybe I’ll just stay

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3]
It’s finally sinking in
One day begins
Another ends
I live them all and back again

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 4]
I’m gonna sit and watch the waves
We laugh, we cry
We live then die
And dream about our yesterday

[Chorus]
Baby, what are we going to do?
I'm so in love with you
Baby, what are we going to do?
I know you're in love with me too

[Verse 1]
Should we go on living together
Or should we get married right away?
Whatever you decide, I'll still love you, baby
An' we'll grow stronger everyday

[Chorus]
Baby, what are we going to do?
I barely have enough money for two
Baby, what are we going to do?
I don't want to regret what I've done to you

[Verse 2]
I never would've thought that this would happen
To a very careful man like me
But baby, pretty baby, we're gonna work it out, yeah
I love you, I love you, can't you see?
Baby, baby, baby
It's you, said it's you, I truly adore
Baby, baby, we're going to work it out
I hope our baby has eyes just like yours

[Verse 1]
Hey, lover, I got a sugarcane
That I want to lose in you, baby can you stand the pain?
Hey, lover, sugar, don't you see?
There's so many things that you do to me
Ooh, baby!

[Verse 2]
(Hey, lover)
All I want to see is the love in your eyes
And all I wanna hear is your sweet love sighs
(Hey, lover)
All I wanna feel is a burning flame
Tell me, tell me, baby, that you feel the same
Tell me that you feel the same way I do
Tell me that you love me, girl

[Pre-Chorus]
If this is lust, then I must confess I feel it every day
If this is wrong, then I long to be as far from right as I may

[Chorus]
Soft and wet
Soft and wet

[Synth Solo]

[Chorus]
Soft and wet
Soft and wet

[Bridge]
Every time I'm with you, you just love me to death
Ooh wee, baby, you leave me without breath
Oh, baby!
Ooh, yeah

[Verse 3]
(Hey, lover)
You're just as soft as a lion tamed
You're just as wet as the evening rain
(Hey, lover)
And I really dig it when you call my name
Your love is driving me, you're driving me insane
Crazy, baby, oh, girl
Crazy about your love!

[Chorus]
Soft and wet (You know)
You are soft and wet (Oh, sugar)
Your love is soft and wet
Ooh, soft and wet

[Verse]
You have got a strange way about you
Kind of crazy but I love you just the same
Because you, oh you make me want to do, oh everything

[Chorus]
I'm just a crazy fool, lost in the world of love
I get from crazy you
Oh, I'm so strung out thinking about the crazy things you do
Crazy you

[Verse 1]
Ever since I met you, baby
I've been wanting to lay you down
But it's so hard to get you
Baby, when you never come around
Every day that you keep it away
It only makes me want it more
Ooh baby, just say the word
And I'll be at your door

[Pre-Chorus]
What more do I have to say?
I really want to play in your river

[Chorus]
Falling, falling, falling in love
I'm falling, baby, deeper every day
(In love)
You're breaking my heart and taking me away
(In love)
I'm falling baby, girl, what can I do?
I just can't be without you

[Verse 2]
Ever since I met you, baby
There's been somethin inside of me
That keeps me wanting you
Baby, won't you set me free?
Take off these chains, girl
And I'll take off yours
There's no one in the world, baby
That I wanna love more

[Pre-Chorus]
What else do I have to say?
I really wanna play in your river

[Chorus]
Falling, falling, falling in love
I'm falling baby, deeper every day
(In love)
You're breaking my heart and taking me away
(In love)
I'm falling baby, girl, what can I do?
I just can't be without you

[Chorus]
I'm falling in love
I'm falling baby, deeper everyday
(In love)
You're breaking my heart and taking me away
(In love)
And I'm falling baby, girl, what can I do?
I just can't be without you

[Chorus]
I'm falling, I'm falling
(In love)
I'm drowning baby, in my love for you
(In love)
You're breaking my heart and taking me away
I just don't, I don't know what to say

[Outro]
In love, in love
Oh baby-girl, you're takin' me away
Oh baby, baby, oh baby, baby
In love, in love

[Verse 1]
You can live your own life and I'll live mine
I will never try to keep you down
And even if I only see you some of the time
I'm just happy when you come around
And even if the sun don't shine
I'm warm enough when
You're in these arms of mine

[Chorus]
Just as long as we're together
Every thing's alright, every thing's alright

[Verse 2]
There is nothing that will overcome the love we share
Nothing that will break us apart
Girl, I got to always have you in my hair
Gotta always have you in my heart
Oh baby, your place or mine?
I'll get the music, baby, you bring the wine

[Chorus]
Just as long as we're together
Oh girl, there's nothing better
Just as long as we're together
Every thing's alright, every thing's alright

[Bridge]
Just as long as there is you
I'll be around doing what you want me to
Just as long as there is me
I'll be around to sing that melody, sugar

[Chorus]
Just as long as we're together
Oh baby, every thing's alright
Just as long as we're together
Oh baby, every thing's alright
Just as long as we're together
Oh baby, every thing's alright

[Outro]
Don't you know there ain't better oh

[Verse 1]
You're always on my mind
Day and night, baby, all the time
(All the time)
You mean so much to me
A love like ours just hard to be
You're the wind and the rain
You've got a river that takes away my pain
And the sky that's, oh, so blue
You're everything girl, don't you know I need you
(Need you)

[Chorus]
You are the only thing that keeps me going
You are the only thing that keeps my love alive
You are the only thing that I'll ever need
You don't have to worry, you see, my love is forever

[Verse 2]
Sugar, I don't have to dream
Because you give me what I want
Girl, you know what I need
Forever until my love is through, I, I will love you
(Love you)
Oh, oh, what does it take to make you see
That you are the only one for me
I'll never, never stop loving you
Never, never stop wanting you
Never, never get enough of you, love is forever

[Chorus]
You are the only thing that keeps me going
You are the only thing, keeps my love alive
You are the only thing that I'll ever need
You don't have to worry, my love is forever

[Verse 1]
I had everything I needed
But now my life is so blue
You meant the world to me
But now you're gone and I'm so blue
Even though the sun is shining
I spend my day, I spend my day crying over you
Oh yeah, I spend my day crying over you

[Verse 2]
I feel just like the sky, oh, so blue
Oh baby, don't you know?
Baby don't you know?
I spend my nights all alone
Talking to myself, I am so blue
And everyday the feeling gets stronger
And who's to say just how much longer
I can spend my nights all alone
Talking to myself and just crying over you
I guess I'll just spend my life
So, so blue

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Up until the other day
There remained an empty space, in my bed
Then I took one look at you
And naughty things that we could do
Dance within my head

[Chorus]
Never have I ever made love before
Never have I wanted to 'til now
Lover, can't you see I want you more and more
Take me baby, yeah, I'm yours

[Verse 2]
I'll give you what you want
But please love me now
I'll do anything you want
You're the teacher, show me how

[Chorus]
Never have I ever made love before
Never have I wanted to 'til now
Lover, can't you see I want you more and more
Take me baby, yeah, I'm yours

[Intro]
You know I wanna get a little something
You didn't know
Little secret
It ain't what you got, baby
It's what you do with it
And you doing it
You doing it

[Verse 1]
My guilty pleasure is inspiring my desire
Caught in a love affair with feminine iconic style
So fine, you got good taste
But I hate to see your pretty body going to waste
Prefer to see you in the bare necessities
Like Coco de Mer or La Perla, baby
Getting me aroused in that intimate attire
Erotic fantasies, you know just what I like
Vicky got a secret, everybody knows
Lady in the street, in bed hoes and me
Wearing Cosabella
With nothing but a trench coat, nothing's better

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you're sexy
When you slip it on
Love to see you in it
If you add a little spice, you can have a lot of fun
(You know what I'm talking about)

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a freak for sexy lingerie
Wearing a teddy and a thong, the high strung lace
Sew on that garter, if you wanna make me go harder
Do G strings and pumps, a sheer baby doll
Put it on, is it on, girl?

[Verse 2]
Girl, you're a goddess, when you slip that Eres on
Don't stop, your sexy silhouette on the wall turns me on
Good God, your bod
And our bod keep deep
Don't mope when I say nice, but nasty
I wanna tell your man, I do what I say
(Put it on me)

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you're sexy
When you slip it on
Love to see you in it
If you add a little spice, you can have a lot of fun
(You know what I'm talking about)

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a freak for sexy lingerie
Wearing a teddy and a thong, the high strung lace
Sew on that garter, if you wanna make me go harder
Do G strings and pumps, a sheer baby doll
Put it on, is it on, girl?
'Cause I'm a freak for sexy lingerie
Wearing a teddy and a thong, the high strung lace
Wanna make me harder?
Put it on, here's what I want you to do
Do G strings and pumps, a sheer baby doll
Put it on, is it on, girl?

[Bridge]
What you gonna do? You gonna put it on?
Girl, you so sexy, you ain't gotta take it off
I want you to feed my fetish, slide them thigh-highs down
You looking at me, got me up
Throw them heels back on, come one
Put it on
Girl, you know you turn me on

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a freak for sexy lingerie
Wearing a teddy and a thong, the high strung lace
Sew on that garter, if you wanna make me go harder
Do G strings and pumps, a sheer baby doll
Put it on, is it on, girl?
'Cause I'm a freak for sexy lingerie
Wearing a teddy and a thong, the high strung lace
Do G strings and pumps, a sheer baby doll
Put it on, is it on, girl?
'Cause I'm a freak for sexy lingerie
Wearing a teddy and a thong, the high strung lace
Sew on that garter, if you wanna make me go harder
Do G strings and pumps, a sheer baby doll
Put it on, is it on, girl?

[Outro]
I'ma take it off, girl
I'ma put it on, girl

[Intro]
What I was saying earlier was that
I'm tired of niggas just getting shit they don't deserve

[Hook]
Tina Turn Up need a tune up

[Wayne talking]
You know, when things are different
It only means that they're not the same anymore, you know
Difference is good, very good

[Verse 2]
Oh so he ain't hear his phone ringin'?

If you was mine, you would be right here with me
Fuck that nigga, fuck that nigga

[Outro]
I asked my homies right, I was like
What do you think I should do?
And man there's only one thing to do
And I was like what's that?
They was like you...ya digg?
And not you in the meaning of me
But you in the meaning of you
Tina Turn Up, you need a tune up, ya digg?
Well I could fix her, young blacksmith
Maintenance man, M & M for short
Melt in your mouth not in your hand

[Verse 1]
Stand up everybody, this is your life
Let me take you to another world, let me take you tonight
You don't need no money, you don't need no clothes
The Second Coming, anything goes

[Chorus]
Sexuality is all you'll ever need
Sexuality, let your body be free

[Verse 2]
Come on everybody, yeah, this is your life
I'm talking about a revolution we got to organize
We don't need no segregation, we don't need no race
New age revelation, I think we got a case

[Chorus]
I'm OK as long as you are here with me
Sexuality is all we ever need
Oh baby

[Refrain]
Reproduction of a new breed, leaders stand up, organize
Reproduction of a new breed, leaders stand up, organize
Reproduction of a new breed, leaders stand up, organize
Everybody
Reproduction of a new breed, leaders stand up, organize
One time say
Reproduction of a new breed, leaders stand up, organize
Reproduction of a new breed, leaders stand up, organize

[Spoken Interlude]
We live in a world overrun by tourists
Tourists, 89 flowers on their back
Inventors of the Accu-jack
They look at life through a pocket camera
What? No flash again?
They're all a bunch of double drags who teach their kids that love is bad
Half of the staff of their brain is on vacation
Mama, are you listening?
We need a new breed, leaders stand up, organize
Don't let your children watch television until they know how to read
Or else all they'll know how to do is cuss, fight, and bleed
No child is bad from the beginning
They only imitate their atmosphere
If they're in the company of tourists, alcohol, and US history
What's to be expected is 3 minus 3
Absolutely nothing

[Refrain]
Stand up, organize
Reproduction of a new breed, leaders stand up, organize
I want to be in the new breed, stand up, organize

[Chorus]
Sexuality is all I'll ever need
Sexuality, I'm going to let my body be free
Sexuality is all I'll ever need
Sexuality, I'm going to let my body be free
Sexuality

[Verse 1]
Here we are in this big old empty room
Staring each other down
You want me just as much as I want you
Let's stop fooling around
Take me baby, kiss me all over
Play with my love
Bring out what's been in me for far too long
Baby, you know that's all I've been dreaming of

[Chorus]
Do me, baby
Like you never done before
Oh, give it to me 'til I just can't take no more
Come on and do me, baby
Like you never done before
I want you now, I just can't wait no more, can't wait, oh

[Verse 2]
Here we are looking for a reason
You to lay me down
For a love like ours is never out of season
So baby please stop teasing me
(Ooh) What you do, I can never love no other
You're the best I ever had
Whenever we're not close to one another
I just want you so bad
So...

[Chorus]
Do me, baby
Like you never done before
(No, no)
Ooh, give it to me 'til I just can't take no more
Come on, do me, baby
Like you never done before
Oooh, I want you now, I just can't wait no more, can't wait

This feeling is too strong, make me wait too long
(I want you now)

[Outro]
Baby, you're leaving me no choice
Okay, what are you going to do, you just going to sit there and watch?
Alright
Are you sure you don't want to close your eyes?
Well, isn't it supposed to take a long time?
I'm not going to stop until the war is over
Help me
There okay, okay
I'm so cold, just hold me

[Verse 1]
My little secret, my private joy
I could never let another play with my toy
My little angel from heaven above
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh I think I'm falling in love

[Chorus]
And I ain't going to tell nobody, nobody about my little pretty toy
All the other kids would love to love you but you're my little private joy
My private joy, you're my private joy
Private joy, such a pretty toy
Joy, you are my private joy

[Verse 2]
You're my little lover, Orgasmatron
Only I know, only I know, baby, what turns you on
You're my little secret neon light
Girl I want to turn it on, turn it on, turn it on every night

[Chorus]
And I ain't going to tell nobody, nobody about my little pretty toy
All the other kids would love to love you but you're my little private joy
My private joy, you're my private joy

[Intro]
A gift from Virgo

[Verse 1]
I wish I could look in your eyes
And tell you how I feel right now inside
Baby, I know that it's real
So real, so real, so real
How I wish I could be with you
How I wish, how I wish, how I wish I could be with you right now

[Verse 2]
Every morning, every afternoon, every night
I wanna be with you
It don't matter if we go to the park or watch a play
Stay in the hotel room all day
I just wanna be with you
I love everything about you from your old school tennis shoes
To the way you move when you're dancing with me

[Verse 3]
Do you remember our first kiss?
It wasn't long enough
Remember the first time we spent those weeks together?
They were not long enough
All of our conversations
All of your sweet pages
They're never long enough

[Chorus]
When it's time for me to leave
It's so hard to say goodbye
I never want to say goodbye
I never, ever want to say goodbye

[Bridge]
One day, we'll make love
Finally, I'll be yours
Only you, only you, I could love you
But it's too late, I already love you
I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you

[Chorus]
Ronnie talk to Russia, before its too late
Before it's too late
Before it's too late
Ronnie talk to Russia before its too late
Before they blow up the world

[Verse]
You go to the zoo, but you can't feed guerrillas
Can't feed guerrillas
Left-wing guerrillas
You can go to the zoo, but you can't feed guerrillas
Who want to blow up the world

[Bridge]
Ronnie if you're dead, before I get to meet you
Before I get to meet you
Before I get to meet you
Ronnie if you're dead, before I get to meet you
Don't say I didn't warn you

[Chorus]
Ronnie talk to Russia, before its too late
Before it's too late
Before it's too late
Ronnie talk to Russia before its too late
Before they blow up the world
Don't you blow up my world
I believe that harmonies are colors
Every time I paint, it sharpens my harmony
Yesterday, I tried to paint you
But the colors weren't beautiful enough
Your love goes beyond what I can say

Love, Beyoncé

[Verse 1]
Annie Christian wanted to be number one
But her kingdom never comes, thy will be done
She couldn't stand the glory, she would be second to none
The way Annie tells the story, she's his only son
Annie Christian wanted to be a big star
So she moved to Atlanta and she bought a blue car
She killed black children, and what's fair is fair
If you try and say you're crazy, everybody say electric chair
Electric chair

[Chorus]
Annie Christian, Annie Christ
Until you're crucified, I'll live my life in taxicabs
Annie Christian, Annie Christ
Until you're crucified, I'll live my life in taxicabs

[Verse 2]
Annie Christian was a whore always looking for some fun
Being good was such a bore, so she bought a gun

She tried to kill Reagan, everybody say gun control
Gun control

Annie Christian, Annie Christ
Until you're crucified, I'll live my life in taxicabs
Annie Christian, Annie Christ

Annie Christian, Annie Christ
Until you're crucified, I'll live my life in taxicabs

[Verse 1]
If you're looking for somewhere to go
Thought I'd take you to a movie show
Sitting in the back and I'll jack you off
I can't give you everything you want
But I can take you to a restaurant
If you're not hungry, I'll jack you off
If your man ain't no good
Come on over to my neighborhood
We can jump in the sack and I'll jack you off
If you're tired of the masturbator
Little girl, we can go on a date
And if you like, I'll jack you off

[Chorus]
I'll jack you off, jack you off
I'll jack you off, jack you off

[Verse 2]
I only do it for a worthy cause
Virginity or menopause
You'll have an instant heart attack if I jack you off
If you really, really want to be a star
We got to do it in your mamma's car
Naked in a Cadillac, I'll jack you off
If we can't find no place to go
Girl, I'll take you to a movie show
We can sit in the back and I'll jack you off

[Chorus]
I'll jack you off, jack you off
I'll jack you off, jack you off

[Bridge]
Alright say, we'll put some funk on here

[Chorus]
I'll jack you off, jack you off
I'll jack you off, jack you off

There's something about you, baby
It happens all the time
Whenever I'm around you, baby
I get a dirty mind
It doesn't matter where we are
Doesn't matter who's around
Doesn't matter, I just want to lay you down

[Verse 2]
In my daddy's car
It's you I really want to drive
But you never go too far
I may not be your kind of man
I may not be your style
But honey, all I want to do
Is just love you for a little while

[Verse 3]

To buy a dirty mind
Don't misunderstand me

In my daddy's car
It's you I really want to drive
Underneath the stars
I really get a dirty mind
Whenever you're around
I don't want to hurt you, baby
I only want to lay you down

[Verse 1]
Pardon me, I want to talk to you
I may be kind of shy
But I just got to tell you
What I'm going through
Someone over there says
He wants to get to know you
I don't care because
I really want to hold you
And I'm so scared

[Girl], he might do something
To you that you like
Now I've been waiting
Such a bloody long time
Just to get this close to you
Now that you're near me
I want you to hear me
I'll tell you what I want to do

[Chorus]
Oh, I want to do it
Do it all night
I want to do it
Do it to you right

[Verse 2]
Giving up so easy
Is something that I never do
But I'm so easy, so easy
When it comes to loving you
Can't you understand that I want
To hug and kiss you
I'll do anything I can just
To give you happiness
And I drown, baby, drown, baby
In your arms, come on baby
Can't you get to this?
I've been waiting such a bloody long time
And you're talking to someone else
Now that I've got your attention
There's something I want to mention

[Chorus]
Oh, I want to do it
Do it all night
I want to do it
Do it to you right
Oh, I want to do it
Do it all night
I want to do it
Do it to you right
Oh, I want to do it
Do it all night
I want to do it
Do it to you right
Oh, I want to do it
Do it all night
I want to do it
Do it to you right
Oh, I want to do it
Do it all night
I want to do it
Do it to you right

[Verse 1]
I've gotta broken heart again
Because my only supposed-to-be friend
You see, he stole my old lady away from me
And now I'm just as blue as I can be

[Verse 2]
I've gotta broken heart again
Because I ain't got no money to spend
You see, I spent it all on a long distance phone call
Begging her to please come home, yeah, yeah

[Ad lib]
Ah, yeah

[Verse 3]
It doesn't matter what I do
I can't stop, ah, thinking bout you
The little things you said
The things you do to me in bed
Oh baby, I can't get you out to my head
Oh, oh, gotta broken heart again, yeah
This time it's serious
It feels just like the end
Because once your love has gone away
There ain't nothing, nothing left to say

[Verse 1]
She saw me walking down the streets
Of your fine city
It kind of turned me on when she looked at me
And said, "come here"
Now I don't usually talk to strangers
But she looked so pretty
What can I lose
If I just give a little ear?
What's up little girl?
I ain't got time to play
Baby didn't say too much
She said, "Are you gay?"
Kinda took me by surprise
I didn't know what to do
I just looked her in her eyes
And I said, "No, are you?"
Said to myself, said
She's just a crazy, crazy, crazy little mixed up dame
She's just a victim of society
And all its games

[Pre-Chorus]
Now where I come from
We don't let society, tell us how it's supposed to be
Our clothes, our hair, we don't care
It's all about being there

[Chorus]
Everybody's going
Uptown
That's where I want to be
Uptown
Set your mind free
Uptown
Got my body hot
Get down
I don't want to stop, no

[Verse 2]
As soon as we got there
Good times were rolling
White, black, Puerto Rican
Everybody just a-freaking
Good times were rolling
She started dancing in the streets
Girl, she's just gone mad
You know, she even made love to me
Best that I ever had
I don't usually talk to strangers
This time it's all right
See, she got me hot
I couldn't stop
Good times were rolling all night
All night, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Now where I come from
We don't give a damn
We do whatever we please
It ain't about no downtown
Nowhere bound
Narrow-minded drag
It's all about being free

[Chorus]
Everybody's going
Uptown
That's where I want to be
Uptown
Set your mind free
Uptown
Got my body hot
Get down
I don't want to stop, no

[Interlude]

[Outro]
Uptown
Uptown
Everybody's going, everybody's going
Everybody got to,  got to
Uptown
Got to go, got to go-go-go
Got to go Uptown
Uptown
All now
Uptown
Got to go-go-go
Baby, got to go, got to
Uptown
Come on, come on
You, you have to, you got to go
Uptown
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I was only 16, but I guess that's no excuse
My sister was 32, lovely and loose
She don't wear no underwear
She said it only gets in her hair
And it's got a funny way of stopping the juice
My sister never made love to anyone else but me
She's the reason for my, uh, sexuality
Showed me where it's supposed to go
A blow job doesn't mean blow
Incest is everything it's said to be

[Chorus]
Oh, sister
Don't put me on the street again
Oh, sister
I just want to be your friend

[Verse 2]
I was only 16 and only half a man
My sister didn't give a goddamn
She only wanted to turn me out
She took a whip to me until I shout
"Oh, motherfucker, sister,  motherfucker
Can't you understand?"

[Chorus]
Oh, sister
Don't put me on the street again
Oh, sister
I just want to be your friend

[Outro]
I'll do what you want me to do
Don't put me on the street and make me blue
Oh, sister, ooh sister, ooh

[Verse 1]
Honey, we've been together
Honey, for too long
Honey, we've got to make it better
Honey, before we go wrong
Got to try a new position, yeah
Something that'll make it all right
New position, yeah
Let's go fishing in the river, the river of life

[Verse 2]
Honey, we can't last
We can't last
Without a shot of new spunk
Ha!
Honey, forget your past
Forget your past
You've got to try my new funk
You've got to try a new position, yeah
Something that'll make it all right
Oh, a new position, yeah, yeah
Let's go fishing in the river
The river of life
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

[Outro]
Oh, let me do you, come on let me do you, do you
Come on, let me do you
I want, I want to do you, do you
I can make you happy
I can make you H.A.P.P.Y

But I'll do you, I'll do you, do you, do you, like a
Do you, do you like a good man should
I'll do you, do you like a good man should
Honey, let's try a new position

[Verse 1]
I get delirious whenever you're near
Lose all self-control, baby just can't steer
Wheels get locked in place
Stupid look on my face
It comes to making a pass, pretty mama
I just can't win a race

[Chorus]
Because I get delirious
Delirious
Delirious

[Verse 2]
I get delirious when you hold my hand
Body gets so weak I can hardly stand
My temperature's running hot
Baby you got to stop
Because if you don't, I'm going to explode
And girl I got a lot

[Chorus]
Because I get delirious, yeah
Delirious
Delirious

[Verse 3]
I get delirious whenever you're near
Girl you gotta take control because I just can't steer
You're just too much to take
I can't stop, I ain't got no brakes
Girl you got to take me for a little ride up and down
In and out and around your lake

[Chorus]
I'm delirious
You, you, you get me delirious
Baby, lay me down
Delirious
The room, the room, the room is spinning around (Delirious)
Yeah, I'm delirious, yeah, oh I'm, oh I'm
Yeah, delirious, yeah (Delirious)
It's got me in repair, everybody you got to (Delirious)
Everybody, oh Lord, oh yeah, I'm delirious (Delirious)

[Outro]
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah (Delirious)
(Delirious)
(Delirious)
(Delirious)
(Delirious)

[Verse 1]
Excuse me but I need a mouth like yours
To help me forget the girl that just walked out my door
Funny but it seems that you're alone like me
If you are, go let's come see what we can see

[Chorus]
Ooh, little darlin' if you're
Free for a couple of hours (Free for a couple of hours)
If you ain't busy for the next seven years (Next seven years)
Say, let's pretend we're married and go all night
There ain't nothin' wrong if it feels all right
I won't stop until the morning light
Let's pretend we're married and go all night, tonight

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-we-sha-sha-coo-coo-yeah
All the hippies sing together

Excuse me but I need your chemistry
Don't you wanna be my fantasy
My girl's gone and she don't care at all
And if she did, so what?
C'mon, baby, let's b-b-ball

[Chorus]
Ooh, little darlin' if you're
Free for a couple of hours (Free for a couple of hours)
If you ain't busy for the next seven years (Next seven years)
Say, let's pretend we're married and go all night
There ain't nothin' wrong if it feels all right
I won't stop until the morning light
Let's pretend we're married and go all night, tonight

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-we-sha-sha-coo-coo-yeah
All the hippies sing together

Let's just pretend we're married, tonight

Excuse me but I need a mouth like yours
To help me forget the girl that just walked out my door
Let's pretend we're married and do it all night
I won't stop until the morning light

[Chorus]
Ooh, little darlin' if you're
Free for a couple of hours (Free for a couple of hours)
If you ain't busy for the next seven years (Next seven years)
Say, let's pretend we're married and go all night
There ain't nothin' wrong if it feels all right
I won't stop until the morning light
Let's pretend we're married and go all night, tonight
(Ooh-we-sha-sha-coo-coo-yeah)
Pretend we're married
Let's pretend we're married

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-we-sha-sha-coo-coo-yeah

Ooh-we-sha-sha-coo-coo-yeah
Oh everybody yeah

All the hippies sing together
Ooh-we-sha-sha-coo-coo-yeah
Yeah, yeah
My girl's gone and she don't care at all
And if she did, so what?
C'mon, baby, let's ball

I wanna fuck you so bad it hurts, it hurts, it hurts
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna fuck you
Yeah, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna wanna, I wanna fuck you
Look here Marsha, I'm not sayin' this just to be nasty
I sincerely wanna fuck the taste out of your mouth
Can you relate?

My girl's gone and she don't care at all
And if she did, I wouldn't care, let's ball

Whatever you heard about me is true
I change the rules and do what I wanna do
I'm in love with God, he's the only way
'Cuz you and I know we gotta die some day
If you think I'm crazy, you're probably right
But I'm gonna have fun every motherfuckin' night
If you like to fight, you're a double-drag fool
I'm goin' to another life, how 'bout you

[Verse 1]
You ask me if I love you, it's automatic
Because every time you leave me, I die, that's automatic too
You ask me to forgive you, when you know, I'm just an addict
So stop the music baby, You know, You're all I want to do
Hey

[Chorus]
A-U-T-O-matic, just tell me what to do
A-U-T-O-matic, I'm so in love with you

[Verse 2]
You ask me if I'll kiss you, it's automatic
And if you cry, me cry, boo-hoo, that's automatic too
I would never leave you, no matter what you do
Stop the music baby, you know, I'm an automatic fool
Hey

[Chorus]
A-U-T-O-matic, just tell me what to do
A-U-T-O-matic, I'm so in love with you

[Verse 3]
I'll rub your back forever, it's automatic (A-U-T-O-matic)
I'll look for a needle in a haystack, that's automatic too (A-U-T-O-matic)
I'll go down on you all night long, it's automatic
(You will?, yes I will babe)
And even when I'm right, I'll be wrong
That's automatic too (A-U-T-O-matic)
Hey

[Chorus]
A-U-T-O-matic, just tell me what to do
A-U-T-O-matic, I'm so in love with you

[Verse 4]
Hey
So in love with you, yeah (A-U-T-O-matic, just tell me what to do)
Tell me what to do babe (A-U-T-O-matic, so in love with you)
Hey
So in love with you, baby, yeah (A-U-T-O-matic, just tell me what to do)
Alright, alright
Tell me what to do baby (A-U-T-O-matic, so in love with you)
Yeah yeah yeah
Hey

[Chorus]
A-U-T-O-matic
A-U-T-O-matic
Camon baby
A-U-T-O-matic, tell me what to do
A-U-T-O-matic, so in love with you

[Verse 5]
Don't say no man has ever tasted your ice cream
Baby you're the purple star in the night supreme
You'll always be a virgin for no man deserves your love
I only pray that when you dream, I'm the one you dream of
I pray that when you dream, you dream of how we kissed
Not with our lips but with our souls
Stop me if I bore you
Why is it that I think we'd be so good in bed?
Can you hear me? Why do I love you so much?
It's so strange, I'm more comfortable around you when I'm naked
Can you hear me?
I wonder if you have any mercy, don't torture me
Stop the music baby, automatic fool
When it comes to you I'm automatic baby
There's no one else like me
I'm the best you'll ever find
No one else could understand you, you're too complex
They say nothing's perfect, but they don't know you
That's automatic too
Can you hear me? (A-U-T-O-matic)
Yes, I'm addicted to your pleasure
I'm addicted to your pain
It's automatic (A-U-T-O-matic)
Automatically insane
Undress me (A-U-T-O-matic)

[Chorus]
(A-U-T-O-matic)
Hey (A-U-T-O-matic)
(A-U-T-O-matic)
(A-U-T-O-matic)
(A-U-T-O-matic)

[Outro]
Hey
Fasten your seat belts
Prepare for take-off
(I remember how you kissed me)
(Not with your lips but with your soul)
(With you I'm never bored, talk to me some more)
(I can hear you, I'm going to have to torture you now)

[Verse 1]
This morning there was joy in my heart because I know that I loved you so
Scrambled eggs, are so boring, for you're all, all that I want to know
Kisses never lie when delivered with milk from your lips
Morning glories never cry
My love for you, baby, drips

[Chorus]
Life can be so nice
It's a wonderful world, sweet paradise (paradise)
Kiss me once, kiss me twice
Life can be so nice, so nice
Life can be so nice, so nice

[Verse 2]
No one plays the clarinet the way you play my heart
I come a thousand different ways before I even start
You're so nice

[Bridge]
Shivering madly (Shivering madly in your embrace)
Your embrace (is it better than a trip?)
Better than a trip (Morning glories never cry)
(My love is just dripping)
Morning glories crying (Scrambled eggs are boring)
Embrace (mama, you're all I want to know)
I do love you baby, (This morning there was joy in my heart)
You baby (because you know I loved you so, yeah)
Alright

[Chorus]
Life can be so nice
It's a wonderful world, sweet paradise (paradise)
Kiss me once, kiss me twice
Life can be so nice, so nice
Life can be so nice, so nice
Life can be so nice
It's a wonderful world, sweet paradise (paradise)
Kiss me once, kiss me twice
Life can be so nice, so nice
Life can be so nice, so nice

[Verse 1]
Some people tell me I got great legs
Can't figure out why you make me beg
Does not compute (Does not compute)
Don't not compute (Don't not compute)
You think you're special, well so do I
Why do special women make me cry?
Does not compute (Does not compute)
It don't not compute (Don't not compute)

[Chorus]
Must be something in the water they drink
It's been the same with every girl I've had
Must be something in the water they drink
Because why else would a woman want to treat a man so bad?

[Verse 2]
Some people think I'm kind of cute
But that don't compute when it comes to Y-O-U
It don't compute (Don't not compute)
Something mama don't compute (Don't not compute)
What's the hangup? What's the scam?
Guess you think I'm just another one, one of your fans
It don't compute (Don't not compute)
Something honey don't compute (Don't not compute)

[Chorus]
Must be something in the water they drink
It's been the same with every girl I've had
Must be something in the water they drink
Because why else would a woman want to treat a man so bad?

[Verse 3]
I've got to get to you, baby
Some people think I'm kind of smart
Why must a fellow stop with you before he starts?
It don't compute, mama (Does not compute)
Something don't compute (Don't not compute)
I'd buy you clothing, buy you fancy cars
But you got to talk to me, baby, tell me who you really are

[Chorus]
Must be something in the water they drink
It's been the same with every girl I've had
Must be something in the water they drink
Because why else would a woman want to treat a man so bad?

[Outro]
(Must be something in the water you drink)
(Does not compute)
(Don't not compute)
(Don't not compute)
(Must be something in the water you drink)
Bitch, you think you're special? (Must be something in the water you drink)
So do I
(second coming) (Must be something in the water you drink)
Why in God's name
Do you want to make me cry?
Why? Why? (Must be something in the water you drink)
I'd do anything for you, anything (Must be something in the water you drink)
Why don't you talk to me? (Must be something in the water you drink)
Tell me who you are (Must be something in the water you drink)
Don't do this to me (Must be something in the water you drink)
Please don't do this (Must be something in the water you drink)
Why? Why?
I do love you
I do
Or else I wouldn't go through all the things I do

[Verse 1]
Don't sleep until the sunrise, listen to the falling rain
Don't worry about tomorrow, don't worry about your pain
Don't cry unless you're happy, don't smile unless you're blue
Never let that lonely monster take control of you

[Chorus]
Be glad that you are free
Free to change your mind
Free to go most anywhere, anytime
Be glad that you are free
There's many a man who's not
Be glad for what you had, baby, what you've got
Be glad for what you've got

[Verse 2]
I know your heart is beating, my drummer tells me so
If you take your life for granted, your beating heart will go
So don't sleep until you're guilty, because sinners all are we
There's others doing far worse than us, so be glad that you are free

[Chorus]
Be glad that you are free
Free to change your mind
Free to go most anywhere, anytime
Be glad that you are free
There's many a man who's not
Be glad for what you had, baby, what you've got
Be glad for what you've got

[Bridge]
Soldiers are a-marching, they're writing brand new laws
Will we all fight together for the most important cause?
Will we all fight for the right to be free?

[Chorus]
Free
(Be glad that you are free)
Free to change my mind
(Free to change your mind)
Free to go most anywhere, anytime
(Free to go most anywhere, anytime)
I'm just glad, I'm just glad I'm free, yeah
(Be glad that you are free)
There's many a man who's not

Glad for what I had, baby

Glad for what I got, oh yeah

Oh I'm just glad, I'm just glad I'm free, yeah

Free to change my mind

Free to go most anywhere, anytime

[Verse 1]
Lady cab driver, can you take me for a ride?
Don't know where I'm going 'cause I don't know where I've been
Just put your foot on the gas, let's drive
Lady, don't ask questions
Promise I'll tell you no lies
Trouble winds are blowing, I'm growing cold
Get me out of here, I feel I'm going to die

[Chorus]
Lady cab driver, roll up your window fast
Lately trouble winds are blowing hard, and I don't know if I can last

[Verse 2]
Lady, I'm so lonely
I know that's not the way to be
Don't want isolation, but the air it makes me cold
Drive it, baby, drive it, drive this demon out of me
Take me to your mansion
Honey, let's go everywhere
Help me, girl, I'm drowning, mass confusion in my head
Will you accept my tears to pay the fare?

[Chorus]
Lady cab driver, roll up your window fast
Lately trouble winds are blowing hard, and I don't know if I can last, oh-oh

[Interlude]
Lady cab driver, can you take me for a ride?

[Chorus]
Lady cab driver, roll up your window fast
Lately trouble winds are blowing hard, and I don't know if I can last

[Breakdown]
This is for the cab you have to drive for no money at all
This is for why I wasn't born like my brother, handsome and tall
This is for politicians who are bored and believe in war
And this, yeah, that's for me, that's who that one's for
This is for discrimination and egotists who think supreme
And this is for whoever taught you how to kiss in designer jeans
That one's for, that one's for where you have to live
This one's for the rich, not all of 'em, just the greedy
The ones that don't know how to give
This one's for Yosemite Sam and the tourists at Disneyland
And this one, ooh, yeah, that's the one
That's for, that's for the, the creator of man
This is for the sun, the moon, the stars, the tourists at Disneyland
This is for the ocean, the sea, the shore
This is for, and that's for you, and that's who that one's for
This is for the women, so beautifully complex
This one's for love without sex
This is for the wind that blows no matter how fast or slow (Yes)
Not knowing where I'm going
This galaxy's better than not having a place to go
And now I know (I know)

You can dance if you want to
All the critics love you in New York
You don't have to keep the beat
They'll still think it's neat
In New York
You can wear what you want to, it doesn't matter
In New York
You could cut off all your hair
I don't think they'd care
In New York

[Chorus]
All the critics love you in New York

[Verse 2]
Why you can play what you want to
All the critics love you in New York
They won't say that you're naive
If you play what you believe
In New York
Purple love-amour is all you're headed for, but don't show it
The reason that you're cool
Is because you're from the old school
And they know it

All the critics love you in New York

[Verse 1]
Darling, it appears to me
That you could use a date tonight
A body that'll do you right
Tell me: am I qualified?
(I say?)
Baby, I know it's hard to believe
But this body here is free tonight
Your very own first-class flight
My plane's parked right outside, baby
Don't you want to go for a ride? (yeah)

[Chorus]
I'm an international lover, yeah that's right
Let me take you around the world
I'll buy you diamonds and pearls
Only if you're good girl

[Verse 2]
Darling, I know it's been a long time
Since you've been satisfied
I can tell by the look in your eyes
You need it real bad (real bad), you need
It so bad, so bad (real bad)
Baby, maybe if you're good girl
I'll introduce you to my ride
Don't you want to come inside?
Come on baby, I won't fly too fast, I've got so

Got to be good, you got to be good, yeah, yeah, please

[Verse 3]
Good evening. This is your pilot Prince speaking
You are flying aboard the Seduction 747
And this plane is fully equipped with anything
Your body desires
If for any reason there is a loss in cabin pressure
I will automatically drop down to apply more
To activate the flow of excitement
Extinguish all clothing materials and pull my body close to yours
Place my lips over your mouth, and kiss, kiss, normally
In the event there is overexcitement
Your seat cushion may be used as a flotation device
We ask that you please observe the "No Letting Go" sign
I anticipate a few turbulence along the way
We are now making our final approach to Satisfaction
Please bring your lips, your arms, your hips
Into the upped and locked position for landing
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
Yeah

[Outro]
(Let me take it around)
(Let it all hang out)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Welcome to Satisfaction
Please remain awake until the aircraft
Has come to a complete stop
Thank you for flying Prince International
Remember, next time you fly, fly the International Lover

[Verse 6: Cat Glover and Prince]
Talk to me, lover
Come on, tell me what you taste
Didn't your mama tell you
Life is too good to waste? (Put your love down)
Did she tell you Lovesexy
Was the glam of them all?
You can hang, you can trip on it
You surely won't fall (Put your love down)
No side effects, the feeling lasts forever
Straight up, it tastes good
It makes you feel clever (Put your love down)
You kiss your enemies
Like you know you should
Then you jerk your body like
A horny pony would (Put your love down)
You jerk your body like
A horny pony would
Now run and tell your mama about that!
And while you're at it
Tell your papa about this!

[Interlude: Prince]
Put your love down there
When you wanna get shot
Put your love down there
When you wanna get shot
Put your love down there
When you wanna get shot
Put your love down there
When you wanna get shot
Put your love down there

[Outro: Prince, Background Vocalists, & Shelia E.]
Yeah! Ho! Alphabet Street
L-Love, L-Love
L-Love, L-Love
L-Love, L-Love
L-Love, L-Love, Lovesexy
Yeah! Ho! Alphabet Street
Yeah! Ho! Alphabet Street
A, B, C, D, E, F, H
I love you

[Verse 1]
This thing we got, it's alive
It seems to transcend the physical
One touch and I'm satisfied
Must be a dream it's so magical

[Chorus]
Glam Slam thank you ma'am
You really make my day
Glam Slam thank you ma'am
I pray you'll always stay

[Verse 2]
I know I hold you too tight
(Too tight)
But I just can't seem to get close enough
(I want to hold you)
I want to hold you every night
I'm so horny and you're the stuff

[Chorus]
Glam Slam thank you ma'am
You really make my day
Glam Slam thank you ma'am
I pray you'll always stay

[Verse 3]
Heavy feather, flicka nipple
Baby scram water ripple
(I don't understand)
It means I love you
Come a butterfly straight on your skin
You go for me and I come again
Glam Slam, thank you ma'am
Sun is risen, moon is gone
Soda fizzing on the lawn
Come a butterfly straight on your skin
Glam Slam

[Chorus]
Glam Slam thank you ma'am
You really make my day
Glam Slam thank you ma'am
I pray you'll always stay

[Verse 3]
This thing we got, it's alive
It seems to transcend the physical
One touch and I'm satisfied
Must be a dream it's so magical

[Chorus]
Glam Slam thank you ma'am
You really make my day
Glam Slam thank you ma'am
I pray you'll always stay

[Outro]
Glam Slam
You will always stay
You will always stay
It's all right, it's OK

[Verse 1]
Oh, pick it up!
There's a bass guitar in this
Grenade Launcher roars in a television sky
Tell me how many young brothers must die

[Chorus]
Dance on, dance on
Dance on, dance on

[Verse 2]
Little Talk Johnny blew the big score
The gang nailed his feet to a wooden floor
Nuclear Ban never stays in tune
They all know the words but the music is doomed

[Chorus]
Dance on, dance on
Dance on, dance on
Dance on, dance on
Dance on, dance on
Dance on, dance on
Dance on, dance on

[Verse 3]
A bass guitar in spider webs, longing for the funk
Uzi gun takes his place in a wagon trunk
(get off me, punk, you ain't sexy)
Stealing ladies purses then setting them a'flame
M&M killers playing Mickey Mouse games

[Chorus]
Dance on, dance on
Dance on, dance on
Dance on, dance on
Dance on, dance on
Dance on, dance on
Dance on, dance on

[Verse 4]
It's time for new education
The former rules don't apply
We need a power structure that breeds production
Instead of jacks who vandalize
Detroit - what's happening?

[Outro]
What color is your money today?
Get your money straight
Everybody dance on

[Intro]
New Power, New Power, give it to me
Oh, it need some bottom in here
Lay it on me

[Verse 1]
Everybody on the block say it is the best
The most vital is what they say, more or less
It put my name upon my thigh
It makes me dance, It makes me cry
And when I touch it race cars burn rubber in my pants

[Chorus]
This feeling's so good in every single way
I want it morning, noon and night of every day
And if by chance I can not have it, I can't say
But with it I know heaven's just a kiss away
Kiss away

[Verse 2]
Dig me now
Anyone that's ever touched it
They don't want anything else (no they don't)
And I got to tell the world
I just can't keep it to myself
All in life becomes easier
No question is unresolved
And I'm not afraid
Come on and touch it, I know you will love it
With it I know that heaven's a butterfly kiss away

[Chorus]
This feeling's so good in every single way
I want it morning, noon and night of every day
And if by chance I can not have it - I can't say
But with it I know heaven's just a kiss away
Kiss away

[Bridge]
Lovesexy
Lovesexy
Rain is wet, sugar is sweet
Clap your hands, stomp your feet
Everybody, everybody knows (Lovesexy)
When love calls, you got to go
Lovesexy

[Verse 3]
Tonight we make love with only words
Girls first, girls first
OK so like first I would start by telling you how
Smart and intelligent the curve your behind is
And then I can tell you that I can just smell you
And race cars burn rubber in my pants
But I really dig tripping on the thought of
Being caught by someone with your beauty, style, and grace
Baby I don't care I would rip out my hair
For just two nights with your face
I don't want to make love to you
I just want to look at you
I just want to listen to you

[Verse 4]
Oh, pretty little whip, you got me dripping
Dripping all over the floor, the floor
If I come back as a woman, I want a body like yours
A body like yours
Living rooms
I think, I think you would
I think you want to play house
Yeah, I think you want to play house
(Lovesexy)

[Breakdown]
You don't mind
I think you
I think you want me to (beep) inside of you
You want (Lovesexy) me to suck around your living room
Ha Ha
Yeah, you
You want me to walk right down your halls
Mmm hmmm
(Lovesexy)

[Outro]
You want me to swivel in your love seat
Don't you baby?
You want me to write my name on your walls
You want me to write my name
Lovesexy
We make love with only words
I'll make love to you, tomorrow
Sweet dreams

[Intro]
Oooh Doggies!
Ow!
Oh, oh, oh!

[Verse 1]
We want to play in the sunshine
We want to be free
Without the help of a Margarita or Ecstasy
We want to kick like we used to
Sign up on the dotted line
We going to dance every dance
Like it's going to be the last time
We got to play in the sunshine
Turn all the lights up to 10
I want to meet you (meet you), kiss you (kiss you)
Love you (love you), and miss you (miss you)
Do it all over again, do it all over again

[Chorus]
We going to play in the sunshine
We're going to get over
I'm feeling kind of lucky tonight
I'm going to find my four leaf clover
Before my life is done
Some way, some how, I'm going to have fun

[Verse 2]
Play in the sunshine
We going to love all our enemies
Till the gorilla falls off the wall
We're going to rock him
We're going to roll him
We're going to teach him that love will make him tall (somehow)
Aah, pop goes the music
When the big white rabbit begin to talk
And the colour green will make your best friends leave ya
It will make them do the walk
But that's cool
Cuz one day, everyday will be a yellow day/holiday
And let's play

[Chorus]
We going to play in the sunshine
We're going to get over
I'm feeling kind of lucky tonight
I'm going to find my four leaf clover
Before my life is done
Some way, some how, I'm going to have fun
We going to play in the sunshine
We're going to get over
I'm feeling kind of lucky tonight
I'm going to find my four leaf clover
Before my life is done
Some way, some how, I'm going to have fun

[Outro]
(play), (play)
(play) no, (play) no, (play) no
(come on, play) no!, (play) no!, (play play play) Yes!
Drummer, do your thing
Drummer, drummer, do your thing
Drummer, drummer, drummer
Can I get some of that?
Wait  minute!
Da da da da da, da da

Let's get out of here (yeah)
(lalalalalalala play, laugh in the sunshine)
We're not afraid to (play, laugh in the sunshine)
We are going to
(play, laugh in the sunshine)
(play, laugh in the sunshine)
La la la

[Intro]
So fair she looked tonight
The brightest star appeals to your sex
Before we do anything
Let me just talk to you

[Verse 1]
When two are in love
They whisper secrets
Only they too can hear
When two are in love
When two are in love (love)
Their stomachs pound
Every time the other comes near
When two are in love

[Verse 2]
When two are in love
Falling leaves will appear to them
Like slow motion rain (slow motion, slow motion)
When two are in love
The speed of their hips
Can be faster than a runaway train
Drop, drop, drip, drop, water, water, water

[Chorus]
Come bathe with me
Let's drown each other in each others emotions
Bathe with me
Let's cover each other with perfume and lotion
Bathe with me
Let me touch your body 'til your river's an ocean
Bathe with me
Let's kiss with one synonymous notion
That nothing's forbidden and nothing's taboo
When two are in love
L.o.v.e. - l.o.v.e - can you hear me?

[Verse 3]
When two are in love
Their bodies shiver at the mere contemplation
Of penetration (let alone the act)
Let alone the actual act
When two are in love
The thought of his tongue in the V of her love
In his mind, this thought it leads the pack

[Chorus]
Come bathe with me
Let's drown each other in each others emotions
Bathe with me
Let's cover each other with perfume and lotion
Bathe with me
Let me touch your body 'til your river's an ocean
Bathe with me
Let's kiss with one synonymous notion
That nothing's forbidden and nothing's taboo
When two are in love
Love - in love - can you hear me?

[Outro]
Hold me, yeah
Just like that, don't move

[Intro]
Shut up already, damn!
Tell me who in this house know about the quake?
We do
I mean really, really
If you know how to rock say 'yeah'
Yeah
If you know how to party say 'oh yeah'
Oh yeah
But if you ain't hip to the rare house quake:
Shut up already, damn!

[Chorus]
Housequake
Everybody jump up and down
Housequake
There's a brand new groove going round
(Housequake)
In your funky town
(Housequake)
And the kick drum is the fault
You got to rock this mother, say
(Housequake)
We got to rock this mother, say
(Housequake)

[Verse 1]
We're going to show you what to do
You put your foot down on the two
You jump up on the one
Now you're having fun
You're doing the housequake
Yeah
Question:
Does anybody know about the quake?
(Yeah!)
Bullshit!
You can't get off until you make the house shake
Now everybody clap your hands
Come on
Let's jam y'all
Let's jam
Don't wait for your neighbour
Green eggs and ham

[Chorus]
Doing the housequake
There's a brand new groove going round
In your city, in your town: Housequake
And the kick drum is the fault
Housequake
(Housequake)
Housequake
You got to rock this mother
(You got to rock this mother)
Housequake, housequake
You got to rock this mother down
Come on
Housequake, housequake

[Verse 2]
Now that you got it, let's do the twist
A little bit harder than they did in '66
A little bit faster than they did in '67
Twist little sister and go to heaven
Come on you all, we got to jam
Before the police come
A groove this funky is on the run
Hey yeah!
Shake your body until your neighbours stare atcha!
Quake, quake, quake, quake, quake, quake

[Chorus]
Housequake
Everybody jump up and down
Housequake
There's a brand new groove going round
(Housequake)
In this city, in your funky town
And the saxophone is the fault
Check it out
If you can't rock steady
Shut up already, damn, you got to get off!
You know what I'm talking about?
On the one, you all say: housequake
Top of your body, let me hear you shout
Say, housequake
My lord
(Housequake)
My lord
(Housequake)
Bullshit
Louder, say it
(Housequake)
Shock-a-lock-a boom!
What was that? After shock!
Everybody, everybody
You got to rock, you got to rock
Come on

[Outro]
We're going to shake, we're going quake
Because we got the baddest groove that we could a make
We on the two, y'all
The drummer's gonna tap
We gonna see if we can rock this mother to the max
And that's a fact
Housequake
Come on say it
(Housequake)
Come on
You can't follow it
We got the baddest jam in the land
Everybody shut up, listen to the band
Housequake
Shut up already, damn

[Verse 1]
Doubts of our conviction
Follow where we go
And when the world's compassion
Ceases, still I know
For your every touch, I
Thank you so much
For your every kiss, I

[Chorus]
I wish you love
I wish you heaven
I wish you heaven

[Verse 2]
If I see eleven
You can say it's seven
Still I wish you heaven

[Chorus]
I wish you love
I wish you heaven
I wish you heaven

[Bridge]
La la la la la, do do do do do
La la la la la, do do do do do
La la la la la

[Chorus]
I wish you love
I wish you heaven
I wish you love
I wish you heaven
I wish you love
I wish you heaven
I wish you love
I wish you heaven

[Verse 1]
I think about it baby all the time, all right
It feels so good it must be a crime, all right
I want to do it baby every day, all right
In a bed, on the stairs, anywhere, all right

[Chorus]
I want to do it baby all the time, all right
Because when we do it girl, it's so divine, all right

[Verse 2]
I could be guilty for my honesty, (all right)
But I've got to tell you what you mean to me, (all right) all right
With you I swear, I'm a maniac, all right
You see it ain't no joke, just a natural fact, all right (all right)

[Chorus]
I want to do it baby all the time, all right
Because when we do it girl, it's so divine, all right
Doing it, doing it
Doing it, doing it

[Verse 2]
I could be guilty for my honesty, all right
But I gotta, I've got to tell you what you mean to me, all right
Yeah, I wanna

[Chorus]
I want to do it baby all the time, all right, yeah
'Cause when we do it girl, it's so divine, all right
I want to do it baby all the time, all right, yeah
You see it ain't no joke, it's so divine, all right, all right
I want to do you baby all the time, all right, yeah
'Cause when we do it girl, it's so divine, all right

[Verse 3]
You wanna think about it
You wanna think about it baby, all the time
(Think about it all the time) fucking on your mind
(Feels so good, must be a crime)
(Whoa, whoa, whoa)

[Outro]
Doing it, doing it
Doing it, doing it
(Come on)
(Come on)

[Chorus]
Positivity (Yes!)
Have you had your plus sign today?
Positivity (Yes!)
Do we mark you present, or do we mark you late?

[Verse 1]
Is that a good man
Walking down that street with that money in his hand
Is that a good man?
Why do you dog him
If that was your father, tell me, would you dog him then
Would you dog him?

[Chorus]
Positivity (Yes!)
Have you had your plus sign today?
Positivity (Yes!)
Do we mark you present, or do we mark you late?

[Verse 2]
Is that all your gold?
Where did it come from? What did you have to do?
Can you sleep nights?
Do you dream straight up or do you dream in W's?

[Chorus]
Positivity (Yes!)
Have you had your plus sign today?
Positivity (Yes!)
Do we mark you present, or do we mark you lat

[Post-Chorus]
Na na na na na na, so slow
Positivity (Yes)
Na na na na na na, so slow

[Verse 3]
Can a boy who drops out at school
At 13 years of age
Answer to of life and death
When it slaps him in the face?
Who's to blame when he's got no place to go
And all he's got is the sense to know
That a life of crime'll help him beat You in the race
Help him beat you in the race (Help him beat you in the race)
Positivity

[Chorus]
Positivity (Yes!)
Have you had your plus sign today?
Positivity (Yes!)
Do we mark you present, or do we mark you late?
Positivity (Yes!)
Have you had your plus sign today?
Positivity (Yes!)
Do we mark you present, or do we mark you late?

[Post-Chorus]
Na na na na na na, so slow
Positivity (Yes!)
Na na na na na na, so slow

[Verse 4]
Wave your hands for positivity y'all!
All the boys and all the girls
You are the new kings of the world!
Shall the court sing together
"In every man's life there will be a hang-up
A whirlwind designed to slow you down
It cuts like a knife and tries to get in you
This Spooky Electric sound
Give up if you want to and all is lost
Spooky Electric will be your boss"

[Verse 5]
Call People magazine, Rolling Stone
Call your next of kin, cause your ass is gone
He's got a 57 mag with the price tag still on the side
Cuzzin when Spooky say dead, you better say died
Or you can fly high right by Spooky and all that he crawls for
Spooky and all that he crawls for
Don't kiss the beast
We need love and honesty, peace and harmony
Positivity
Love and honesty, peace and harmony
I said, hold on to your soul, you got a long way to go

[Outro]
Don't kiss the beast
Be superior at least
Hold on to your soul, y'all, court, sing
Hold on to your soul, we got a long way to go
Hold on to your soul

[Verse 1]
It was 7:45 we were all in line
To greet the teacher Miss Cathleen
First was Kevin, then came Lucy, third in line was me
All of us were ordinary compared to Cynthia Rose
She always stood at the back of the line
A smile beneath her nose
Her favourite number was 20 and every single day
If you asked her what she had for breakfast
This is what she'd say

[Chorus]
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam
Butterscotch clouds, a tangerine
And a side order of ham
If you set your mind free, baby
Maybe you'd understand
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam

[Verse 2]
Cynthia wore the prettiest dress
With different colour socks
Sometimes I wondered if the mates were in her lunch box
Me and Lucy opened it when Cynthia wasn't around
Lucy cried, I almost died, you know what we found?

[Chorus]
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam
Butterscotch clouds, a tangerine
And a side order of ham
If you set your mind free, baby
Maybe you'd understand
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam

[Verse 3]
(Starfish and coffee)
Cynthia had a happy face, just like the one she'd draw
On every wall in every school
But it's all right, it's for a worthy cause
Go on, Cynthia, keep singing

[Chorus]
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam
Butterscotch clouds, a tangerine
And a side order of ham
If you set your mind free, baby
Maybe you'd understand
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam

[Outro]
(starfish in your coffee, you will love it, told you so)
(starfish in your coffee, you will love it, told you so)

[Intro: Sampled Dialogue]
"I'm not going to kill you. I want you to do me a favor
I want you to tell all your friends about me."
"What are you?"
"I'm Batman!"

[Chorus]
I've seen the future and it will be
I've seen the future and it works
And if there's life after, we will see
So I can't go like a jerk

[Verse 1]
Systematic overthrow of the underclass
Hollywood conjures images of the past
New world needs spirituality
That will last
I've seen the future and it will be

[Chorus]
I've seen the future and it will be
I've seen the future and it works
And if there's life after, we will see
So I can't go like a jerk

[Verse 2]
Yellow Smiley offers me X
Like he's drinking seven up
I would rather drink six razor blades
Razor blades from a paper cup
He can't understand, I say too tough
It's just that I've seen the future
And boy it's rough

[Chorus]
I've seen the future and it will be
I've seen the future and it works
And if there's life after, we will see
So I can't go like a jerk

[Verse 3]
I've seen the future and it will be
Wait a minute
Pretty pony standing on the avenue
Flashing a loaded pistol, too dumb to be true
Somebody told him playing cops and robbers was cool
Would our rap have been different if we only knew?

[Chorus]
I've seen the future and it will be
I've seen the future and it works
And if there's life after, we will see
So I can't go like a jerk

[Verse 4]
Systematic overthrow of the underclass
Hollywood conjures images of the past
New world needs spirituality
That will last
I've seen the future and it will be
I've seen the future and it will be
I've seen the future and it will be
I've seen the future and it will be
I've seen the future and it will be
I've seen the future and it will be

[Outro]
"Think about the future"

[Verse 1]
Young is the night
It feels so right
Now that you're mine
Let's take our time
The man in the moon is smiling
For he knows what I'm dreaming of
Tonight is the night for making slow love
The gentle breeze
It blows with ease
Let's make IT slow
Just like the wind blows
Let's make IT last forever
For a hundred times won't be enough
Tonight is the night for making slow love

[Chorus]
Slow love
So much better when we take it easy
Slow love
So much better when we take our time

[Verse 2]
Love's in your eyes (in your eyes)
Eyes never lie
Don't rush the feeling
You've got me reeling
You can see through race car drivers
Let me show you what I'm made of
Tonight is the night for making slow love

[Chorus]
Slow love
So much better when we take it easy
Slow love
So much better when we take our time

[Verse 1]
I saw your friend first
That's who I danced with
All the time I was watching you
The music rocked us
Our eyes locked-thus
Making us see a trippy picture shoo

[Chorus]
If a man is considered guilty
For what goes on in his mind
Then give me the electric chair
For all my future crimes, oh

[Verse 2]
You whispered something
It took my mind out like a
G flat major with an E in the bass
Your face looked so good
I wanted to touch your mouth
My brain is jacking all over the place

[Chorus]
If a man is considered guilty
For what goes on in his mind
Then give me the electric chair
For all my future crimes, oh

[Verse 3]
Let's take a drive, love
So we can make up our minds, love
To commit the crimes of passion
That sets us free
Me loving you, you loving me
Me loving you, you loving me
The electric chair

[Verse 4]
I saw your friend first
That's who I danced with
All the time I was watching you
The music rocked us
Our lives shocked us
Making us see a trippy picture shoot
I've got to have it
Somebody

[Chorus]
If a man is considered guilty
For what goes on in his mind
Then give me the electric chair
For all my future crimes, oh

[Outro]
You know I'm guilty, yeah
For all my future crimes
Guilty
For all my future crimes
And if you don't really love me
Then give me the electric chair, oh!
Electric chair

[Verse 1: Prince and Sheena Easton]
Orion's arms are wide enough
To hold us both together
Although we're worlds apart
I'd cross the stars for you
In the heart of a sleepless moon
I'll be with you forever
This is my destiny
'Till my life is through

[Chorus: Prince & Sheena Easton]
The arms of Orion that's where I want to be
Since you've been gone
I've been searching for a lover
In the Sea of Tranquility
I'm drowning without you here, my dear

[Verse 2: Prince and Sheena Easton]
When I am lost and feeling alone
I just look to heaven
I find my comfort there
God only knows where you are tonight
God only knows where you are tonight
Maybe time will tell me
'Til then I'll close my eyes and say a prayer for you
I'll say a prayer for you too

[Chorus: Prince & Sheena Easton]
The arms of Orion that's where I want to be
Since you've been gone
I've been searching for a lover
In the Sea of Tranquility
I'm drowning without you here, my dear

[Bridge: Prince & Sheena Easton]
Orion's heart is bright enough
To shine on both of us
The constellations never fail
To light the way for love

[Verse 1 Variation: Prince and Sheena Easton]
Orion's arms are wide enough
To hold us both together
Although we're worlds apart
I'd cross the stars for you
I'd cross the stars for you

[Chorus: Prince & Sheena Easton]
The arms of Orion that's where I want to be
Since you've been gone
I've been searching for a lover
In the Sea of Tranquility
I'm drowning without you here, my dear
The arms of Orion that's where I want to be
Since you've been gone
I've been searching for a lover
In the Sea of Tranquility
I'm drowning without you here, my dear

[Outro: Prince & Sheena Easton]
The arms of Orion
The arms of Orion
That's where I want to be
The arms of Orion
Since you've been gone
I've been drowning
Drowning
Drowning without your love
The arms of Orion
The arms of Orion

Hot thing!

[Verse 1]
Hot thing, barely 21
Hot thing, looking for big fun
Hot thing, what's your fantasy?
Hot thing, do you want to play with me?

[Verse 2]
Hot thing, baby you dance so good
Hot thing, baby I knew you would
Hot thing, tell me what you see
Hot thing, When you smile, when you smile, when you smile
Are your smiles, are your smiles for me?

[Verse 3]
Hot thing, maybe you should give your folks a call
Hot thing, tell them you're going to the Crystal Ball
Hot thing, tell them you're coming home late
If you're coming home at all
Hot thing, tell them you found a brand new baby doll
Hot thing, I can't wait to get you home
Hot thing, where we could be alone
Hot thing, I could read you poetry
And then we could make a story of our own

[Interlude]
Hot thing
Hot, hot, hot thing
Hot thing, hot thing
Hot thing, hot thing

[Verse 4]
Hot thing, barely 21
Hot thing, looking for big fun
Hot thing, what's your fantasy?
Hot thing, don't you want to play with me?

Hot thing!
Hot thing!
Hot thing, I can't wait to get you home

Hot thing

[Intro]
La da da da da da da da
La da da da da da da da

[Verse 1]
There comes a time, in every man's life
When he get's tired of fooling around
Juggling hearts in a three ring circus
Someday will drive a body down to the ground
I never imagined that love would rain on me
And make me want to settle down

[Chorus]
Baby it's true, I think I do
And I just want to tell you that I wanna with you
(Baby, if you do too)
And baby if you do too
Forever, forever, baby I want you forever
I want to keep you for the rest of my life
(You can make right)
All that is wrong in my world
(You are my savior)
You can make right
(You are my light)
You are my savior, you are my light
(Forever I want you in my life)
Forever I want you in my life

(Every man's journey)
There comes a road in every man's journey
(Don't be afraid)
A road that he's afraid to walk on his own
(I'm at that road)
I'm here to tell you that I'm at that road
(I'd rather walk it with)
And I'd rather walk it
(You than walk it alone)
With you than walk it alone
(You are my future)
You are my hero, you are my future
(No past)
When I am with you, I have no past
Oh baby my one and only desire
(Make this feeling last)
Is find some way in this dog gone world
(Sugar, it's true)
To make this feeling last
(I know I do)

[Chorus]
Oh baby it's true, I know I do
(To with you)
And I just want to tell you that
I want to with you, yeah
And baby if you do too
Forever, forever, I want you baby, baby forever

I want to keep you for the rest of my life

All that is wrong in my world

You can make right

Love sign
Love, love

[Chorus]
If you are sick of evil knocking on your door
Throw up the love sign once and forever more
If you would rather make love and have a little fun
Throw up the love sign everybody and not the gun

[Verse 1]
In a chariot of red and gold
The cool, fuzzy voice said, "Come save your soul"
Before the fear of rejection reared its head
He stood before the masses and calmly said

[Chorus]
If you are sick of evil knocking on your door
Throw up the love sign once and forever more
If you would rather make love and have a little fun
Throw up the love sign everybody and not the gun

[Verse 2]
In the day of where and why we all belong
Don't nobody want to hear a silly love song
And if they did then we would sing it on the news
While you are aiming your gun at me and I'm aiming back at you

[Chorus]
If you are sick of evil knocking on your door
Throw up the love sign once and forever more
If you would rather make love and have a little fun
Throw up the love sign everybody and not the gun

[Ad Lib]
Now
Song now
Everybody sing the song now

[Verse 3]
If you only had one year left to live
What good is the time you spend if you got no love to give?
Let's all get up off the front and find a cause to back
Then we can teach the babies replications of the act, of the act

[Chorus]
If you are sick of evil knocking on your door
Throw up the love sign once and forever more
If you would rather make love and have a little fun
Throw up the love sign everybody and not the gun
If you are sick of evil knocking on your door
Throw up the love sign once and forever more
If you would rather make love and have a little fun
Throw up the love sign everybody and not the gun

[Outro]
(Sick of evil knocking, yeah)
(Then ev..everybody, oh)
(We can have a little fun)
(Everybody, oh yeah)
(Oh yeah)
(forever more)
(Make a little love now)
(We can make love instead of guns, oh)

I'm of the mind to make some mookie
Phonebook

[Verse 1]
The phone rings, it's Vicki calling
She wants me to come to the crib
She says conversation's better than being lonely
So I try my best to ad lib
I told the joke about the woman
Who asked her lover "Why is your organ so small?"
He replied "I didn't know I was playing in a cathedral"
Vicki didn't laugh at all

[Chorus]
This is where she wants to be
I am what she wants to see
I never known a love so sweet
Still I keep Vicki waiting
(All right)

[Verse 2]
All is well in Gotham City
The sound of terror is all you hear
Sometimes a pistol takes the place of her body
Sometimes her body's here
But you see when crime is your only love
All that matter is the present, the here and now
People, people, whatever floats this joker's boat
Is whatever this joker will bang

[Chorus]
This is where she wants to be
I am what she wants to see
Never known a love so sweet
Still I keep Vicki waiting
(Oh dear)

[Verse 3]
Talk of children still frightens me
Is my character enough to be
One that deserves a copy made?
This I one day, hope to see
Until then she's held at bay
By my animal-like persistence
Or maybe she's just to proud to say
That fate brought us together
And this is where she wants to stay

[Chorus]
This is where she wants to be
I, I am what she wants to see
Never known a love so sweet
Still I keep Vicki waiting

[Chorus]
This is where she wants to be
I, I am what she wants to see
Never known
Never known a love so sweet
Still I keep Vicki waiting

[Chorus]
(All is well in Gotham town)
This is where she wants to be
I am what she wants to see
Never known a love so sweet
Still I keep Vicki
Still I keep Vicki
Still I keep Vicki waiting

[Outro]
Still I keep Vicki
Still I keep Vicki waiting
This is where she wants to be

[Verse 1]
When it's ice cream weather get the gang back together
Roll down your windows and ride
They'll be sleeping in the sand dunes dancing in the streets
They're just trying to keep the summer alive

[Chorus]
They're just trying to keep the summer alive
(Sum-sum-summer alive)
They're just trying to keep the summer alive
(Ah keep the summer)
They're just trying to keep the summer alive
(Sum-sum-summer alive)
They're just trying to keep the summer alive
(Try to keep the summer)

[Verse 2]
When it's ice cream weather all the girls will look better
The boys try to give them a ride
To the one last party before the school bell rings
They're just trying to keep the summer alive

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Lay down in the sun
And watch the clouds roll by
And being with the one you love
In the summertime

[Verse 3]
When it's last September back in school we'll remember
The cure for the wintertime blues
Grab your girl hit the road head on down to the beach
You'll be coming home with sand in your shoes

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Outro]
Keep the summer alive
(yeah yeah uh huh I know we'll keep the summer)
We'll just

[Chorus]
Trust - who do you?
Trust - what makes you a real lover?
Trust - I put this question to you
Cause I want you to be with me

[Verse 1]
Love - you cannot imagine
How much I want to give to you
Hot - I get so excited
Just thinking about all we could do
Dig it now
Another world awaits us
Another power to see
Close - don't worry about nobody else
From now on you'll be here with me

Trust - who do you?
Trust - what makes you a real lover?

Cause I want you to be with me

Money - how much'll make you happy?
You can have it all if it'll suit you right
But nothing, I said nothing can take the place
Of you and me kicking it tight, tight!
Come, it's easy
Just let yourself go - don't put up a fight
Sex - it's not that type of party
Girl, we're getting higher tonight

[Chorus]
Trust - who do you?
Trust - what makes you a real lover?
Trust - I put this question to you
Cause I want you to be with me

Trust - what makes you a real lover?
Trust - I put this question to you
Cause I want you to be with me

[Outro]
Wait, I want you with me

[Verse 1]
Before we met there must have been some others
Like storybook and fairy tale lovers
But in my life there's never been another
So perfect lover

[Chorus]
Oh ho darling
Now that I've found you
It's like a missing piece of puzzle has appeared
And now my darling
My love surrounds you
And since you came into my life my love
Perfection's never ever been so near

[Verse 2]
To love and to be loved is so inspiring
And that's why every lover's so desiring
Of the love they're seeking never retiring
Always aspiring
Love like just like moonlight glowing
Our love keeps growing

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Lying here with you in the night
Underneath the heavenly skies
Baby what a beautiful sight
Darling now hold me, hold me tight

[Chorus]

[x2]

Found you (how I love you ee ooo)

[Intro]
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
I guess you know me well, I don't like winter
But I seem to get a kick out of doing you cold
Oh, what the hell, you always surrender
What's this strange relationship that we hold on to?

[Chorus]
Baby, I just can't stand to see you happy
More than that I hate to see you sad
Honey, if you left me I just might do something rash
What's this strange relationship? (Ship, ship, ship)

[Verse 2]
I came and took your love, I took your body
I took all the self-respect you ever had
I took you for a ride and, baby, I'm sorry
The more you love me, sugar, the more it makes me mad

[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, I just can't stand to see you happy
More than that I hate to see you sad
Honey if you left me I just might do something rash
What's this strange relationship? (Ship, ship, ship)

[Verse 3]
Isn't it a shame this ain't a movie
Then you could rewrite my every line
I'll take all the blame, yo baby, I'm sorry
But I didn't like the way you were, so I had to make you mine

[Chorus]
Baby I just can't stand to see you happy
More than that I hate to see you sad
Honey if you left me I just might do something rash
What's this strange relationship? (Ship, ship, ship)

[Chorus]
Some some some of your love (won't you give me some)
Some of your love
Some some some of your love (dip de doody doo ah ah)

[Verse 1]
You gotta see my favorite little acrobat
She really got her every little move down pat
She's got my vote for number one in the class
I couldn't help but try to make a forward pass

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
There's nothing like a-romancing in the stands
Walking down the hallways a-holding hands
Punching up our jukebox favorite band
Cuddling up in summer moonlight in the sand

[Bridge]
Kiss me, baby
Hold me tight tonight

[Chorus]

[repeat until fade]

[Chorus]
You left me alone with nothing but a heartache
Don't leave me alone living with a heartache
After all this time
I still wish you were mine
I miss you every day
Come back to me and stay
Living with a heartache

[x2]

[Verse 1]
I've loved you for so long
It's hard to believe that you've really gone
I'll try to change to what I should be
I'm no good alone you know-a everyone sees

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Please come back and stay with me
Give our love a chance and maybe you'll see
My love is true like a heart of gold
I promise you a love you can hold

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
We are strangers since we've been apart
And I can't live inside this broken heart
So now I say what's on my mind
It's up to you are we wasting time

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Don't leave me living with a heartache
Mmm mmm mmm mmm

[Intro]
School days
School days
Dear old Golden Rule days

[Verse]
Up in the morning and out to school
The teacher is teaching the Golden Rule
American History and Practical Math
Studying hard and hoping to pass
And working your fingers right down the bone
The guy behind you won't leave you alone
Ring ring goes the bell
The cook in the lunchroom ready to sell
You're lucky if you can find a seat
You're fortunate if you have time to eat
Back in the classroom open your books
The teacher don't know how mean she looks
Soon as three o'clock rolls around
You finally lay your burden down
Throw down your books get out of your seat
And down the halls and into the street
Up to the corner and around the bend
Right to the juke joint you go in
Drop the coin right into the slot
You gotta hear something that's really hot
With the one you love you're making romance
And all day long you've been wanting to dance
Feeling the music from head to toe
And round and round and round you go

[Outro]
Hail hail rock and roll
Deliver me from the days of old
Long live rock and roll
The beat of the drums loud and bold
Rock rock rock and roll
The feeling is there, body and soul

[Intro]
Ready for the crush

[Chorus]
Every time you kiss me: lemon crush
Nay, I can't resist thee: lemon crush
Every time you do me: such a rush
Ooh it goes right through me: lemon crush

Of your ooh, pretty, pretty
And I'm the wildest in the city
Ooh, pretty, pretty one

[Chorus]
Every time you kiss me: lemon crush
Nay, I can't resist thee: lemon crush
Every time you do me: such a rush
Ooh it goes right through me: lemon crush

If I'm working at my jobber
I'm the victim, you're the robber
No matter how much I try to stop her
I can't help thinking about you
Lemon crush, I'm ready for the crush

[Chorus]
Every time you kiss me: lemon crush
Nay, I can't resist thee: lemon crush
Every time you do me: such a rush
Ooh it goes right through me: lemon crush

[Breakdown]

I look in the mirror
It couldn't be clearer
Something is gone from my eyes

[Chorus]
Going on

I know what is missing
Because since you've been gone
My mind keeps on reeling (mind keeps on reeling)
My heart keeps on feeling (heart keeps on feeling)
Why is my love going on (going on)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I love you

Things won't be the same till I kiss you
I'm empty
Without you

But still I can't shake it (but still I can't shake it)
Our love still lives on in my heart (in my heart)

Things won't be the same till I'm with you

[Verse 1]
Come, closer
Feel what you've been dying for
Don't be afraid, baby
Touch it and explode
Understand, understand that I love you
But more than that
I want you
Everybody always told me
Good things come to those who wait
But I've got so much on the menu
I just can't, I just can't
I can't wait baby
I can't wait baby
I can wrap my legs around you girl
'Cause sugar, you know you're just the kind of lover
That I've been looking for
Tonight why don't we skip all the foreplay, mamma
And just get down here on the floor

[Chorus]
Scandalous
I'm talking about you and me
Marvelous
Baby, baby, can't you see
Anything you've ever dreamed of
I'm willing to be
Tonight it's going to be scandalous
'Cause tonight I'm going to be your fantasy

[Verse 2]
My dearest, my dearest
(Whisper) Whisper a question
With my body (body) I'll scream a reply
Anything's acceptable
Just ask me and I'll try it
To hell with hesitation
To hell with the reasons why

[Chorus]
Scandalous
I'm talking about you and me
Marvelous
Baby, baby, can't you see
Anything you've ever dreamed of
I'm willing to be
Tonight it's going to be scandalous
'Cause tonight I'm going to be your fantasy

[Verse 3]
Oh girl, the things you make me do!
Genius is the only way to describe you
Anything you've ever dreamed of baby
Just ask me
I'll do, I'll do

Spirits rise and spirits fall
Anything you ever dreamed off, I'm willing to be
Tonight is going be scandalous
'Cause tonight I'm, tonight I'm going to be your fantasy

With a smile she brings me light
She can make my whole world bright
She brings out the sun at night
She's my sunshine

[Bridge]
Life would be full

[?]
Sailing on the sea
In a boat
Just a bended knee
And propose
That she'll be my only one

[Verse 2]
She can make you feel so fine
Like to love her all the time
It's the reason I'm a-pleasing my sunshine

[Chorus]
Some-a-day I'm
Going to marry her
Some-a-way I'm
Going to carry her
To a place where we can play in the sun

Like a full moon shining bright
She'll light up the darkest night
Will she squeeze me
How she'll please me
Sunshine

Never felt a kiss so sweet
Never could I ever meet
Someone even half as sweet as my
Sunshine

[Intro]
Dear Dad
Things didn't turn out quite like I wanted them to
Sometimes I feel like I'm going to explode
Everybody want to see you down for the count
But that isn't what being a real man's about
The brave and the bold hang around for the kill
So the bigger the hole, the bigger we fill it
Fill it!
They can hit us with all they got
But cha know what?
What?

[Verse 1]
I can't stop this feeling I got
I feel it right down to my toes
I can't stop this feeling I got
My body got to have it you know
I can't stop this feeling I got
I'll write a letter to the whole world
I can't stop this feeling I got
Every man, woman, boy and girl

[Chorus]
Can't stop this feeling I got, I can't stop this feeling I got
I can't stop this feeling I got, I can't stop this feeling I got

[Verse 2]
I can't stop this feeling I got
You know I can't sleep at night
I can't stop, you know I love it a lot
I'm talking about an everlasting light
I can't stop this feeling I got
I get to shaking all in my shoes
I can't stop this feeling I got
The doctor say there's nothing that he can do

[Chorus]
I can't stop this feeling I got, I can't stop this feeling I got
I can't stop this feeling I got, I can't stop this feeling I got
Gonna sing it now

[Bridge]
Can't stop
Try to tell me how to paint my palace
That isn't where it's at
That's like trying to tell Columbus that the world is flat
If the song we're singing truly is the best
Then that my brothers is the ultimate test
All in favor say Aye
We can change anything at all
I, I, I can't stop. can't stop
I'm in a butt kicking mood tonight ya'll

[Chorus]
Can't stop, can't stop
Can't stop this feeling I got
Can't stop this feeling I got
Can't stop this feeling I got
Can't stop this feeling I got
Can't stop this feeling I got
Can't stop this feeling I got
(no, no, no, no)
Feeling, feeling, feeling, hey!

[Intrlude]
Hey, pardon me for living, (pardon me for living)
But this is my world, (this is my world)
You can't make me change (you can't make me change)
Maybe we all got to rearrange (rearrange)
Our brains (our brains)
Only we can change the world
Only we can change the world
Only we can change the world

[Chorus]
1, 2, 1, 2, 3
I can't stop this feeling I got
I can't stop this feeling I got
I can't stop this feeling I got
Feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, yeah!
Yeah!

[Verse]
When girls get together
They like to talk about their latest love
And their description seems somehow to fit just like a glove
When girls get together
They don't waste time on things like weather and stuff
They all just play around and never seem to discuss it enough
This must have been going on prehistory
They may not ever solve the mystery
But they'll go talk until eternity
When girls get together
And bring up father or brother or men of their lives
It means so much if she's your sister or your mother or your loving wife
I guess we guys might never really know
How good we've got it but we'd like to show
Just how much that we love them so
One bright springtime morning
I overheard an elderly lady's voice
As I walked by her bench she told her friends of her great loss
After they'd gone away
Three little girls came skipping through the park
Talking of little boys and getting home before it's dark
When girls get together

[Verse 1]
Black day, stormy night
No love, no hope in sight
Don't cry, He is coming
Don't die without knowing the cross

[Verse 2]
Ghettos to the left of us
Flowers to the right
There'll be bread for all of us
If we can just bear the cross

[Verse 3]
Sweet song of salvation
A pregnant mother sings
She lives in starvation
Her children need all that she brings

[Verse 4]
We all have our problems
Some big, some are small
Soon all of our problems
Will be taken by the cross

[Verse 5]
Black day, stormy night
No love, no hope in sight
Don't cry for He's coming
Don't die without knowing the cross

[Verse 6]
Ghettos to the left of us
Flowers to the right
There'll be bread for all, y'all
If we can just, just bear the cross, yeah

[Verse 7]
We all have our problems
Some are big, some are small
Soon all of our problems, y'all
Will be taken by the cross

[Outro]
The cross
The cross

[Intro]
Lay down your funky weapon
Yeah y'all, here we go
Pumping the big noise in the 90's

[Verse 1]
Pardon me for living, but this is my world too
I can't help that what's cool to us might be strange to you
Pardon me for breathing, can we borrow some of your air?
The problem with you and your kind is that you don't know love is there

[Pre-Chorus]
Lay down your funky weapon, come join us on the floor
Making love and music's the only things worth fighting for

[Chorus]
We are the new power generation, we want to change the world
The only thing that's in our way is you
Your old fashioned music, your old ideas
We're sick and tired of you telling us what to do

[Verse 2]
Pardon me for thinking, but there's something under my hair
I bet you thought the lights were on but no one's living there
You think that if you tell enough lies they will see the truth?
I hope they bury your old ideas the same time they bury you

[Pre-Chorus]
Lay down your funky weapon, come join us on the floor
Making love and music's the only things worth fighting for

[Chorus]
We are the new power generation, we want to change the world
The only thing that's in our way is you
Your old fashioned music, your old ideas
We're sick and tired of you telling us what to do

[Interlude]
We are the new
We are the new, we are the new
Making love and music
New power, we stand

[Verse 3]
Pardon us for caring, we didn't know it was against the rules (shout it out)
If we only want to love one another
Then tell me now who's the fool (tell me, tell me)
No father, no mother, no sister, no brother, nobody can make me stop
Said if you didn't come to party child, I think you better get up of my block

[Pre-Chorus]
Lay down your funky weapon, come join us on the floor
Making love and music's the only things worth fighting for

[Chorus]
We are the new power generation, we want to change the world
The only thing that's in our way is you
Your old fashioned music, your old ideas
We're sick and tired of you telling us what to do
We are the new power generation, we want to change the world
Go on and get up off my block
The only thing that's in our way is you
Get up off my block, because
Your old fashioned music, your old ideas
Love is there if you'd just open up to it
We're sick and tired of you telling us what to do
If you'd just believe your whole world would change

[Outro]
New power generation, you've got to rearrange
We are the new power generation, you've got to give up all the fight
We are the new power generation
We got to try to love one another, baby
We are the new power generation
We are the new power generation

[Verse 4: Sheila E. and Prince]
Said the table to the chair
"You can hardly be aware
How I suffer from the heat
And from chilblains on my feet!
If we took a little walk
We might have a little talk!
Pray let us take the air!"
Said the table to the chair
Can't nobody
Said the chair to the table
"Now you know we are not able!
Fuck with us
How foolishly you talk
When you know we cannot walk!"
Can't nobody
Said the table with a sigh
"It can do no harm to try
Fuck with us
I've as many legs as you
Why can't we walk on two?"
Say, can't nobody
So they both went slowly down
Fuck with us
And walked about the town
With a cheerful bumpy sound
Can't nobody
As they toddled round and round
And everybody cried
As they hastened to their side
Fuck with us
"See the table and the chair
Have come to take the air!"
Y'all... say it y'all
But in going down an alley
To a castle in the valley
They completely lost their way
And wandered all the day
'Til to see them safely back
They paid a ducky-quack
And a beetle and a mouse
Who took them to their house
When they whispered to each other
"O delightful little brother!
Can't nobody fuck with us
What a lovely walk we've taken!
Let us dine on beans and bacon!"
So the ducky and the little brawny-
Say it, y'all
Mousey and the beetle dined
And danced upon the heads
'Til they toddled to their beds
Can't nobody fuck with us
Good God
(Can't nobody fuck with us)
(Can't nobody fuck with us)
(Can't nobody fuck with us)

[Interlude: Prince]
Revolution, baby way down low
Beautiful night, y'all say it
Beautiful night, y'all say it

Miko, Miko, hit me in the back with funk

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro: Prince]
Beautiful night, y'all say it
Beautiful night, y'all say it
Everbody feeling alright, y'all say it
Going to be a beautiful night, y'all say it
Everybody, (oh-we-oh-ooh, oh-we-oh-ooh)
Say it
(Oh-we-oh-ooh, oh-we-oh-ooh)
Say it
(Oh-we-oh-ooh, oh-we-oh-ooh)
(Oh-we-oh-ooh, oh-we-oh-ooh)
Get the horns in here
Keep singing y'all
Everybody clap your hands
Everybody clap your hands
Everbody, groove, come on
Confusion!
Yeah!

[Verse]
So what is the answer to the question of you
What do I look for, what shall I do?
Which way do I turn when I'm feeling lost?
If I sell my soul, now what will it cost?
Must I become naked? No image at all?
Shall I remain upright? Or get down and crawl?
All of the questions in my life will be answered
When I decide which road to choose
What is the answer to the question of you?

[Guitar Solo]

[Intro]
Here in Southern California there is a weather condition known as the Santa Ana Winds

[Verse 1]
Fire wind
Oh desert wind
She was born in a desert breeze
And wind her way
Through Canyon Way
From the desert to the silvery sea

In every direction
See the perfection
And see the San Gabriel Mountain scene

[Chorus]
Santa Ana winds keep blowing across my eyes
Santa Ana winds keep blowing across my eyes

[Verse 2]
Fill my sails
Oh desert wind
And hold the waves high for me
Then I will come
And test my skill
Where the Santa Ana winds blow free
In waves of elation
My part of creation
Becoming one with the boundless sea

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I am the wind
Oh desert wind
On my pilgrimage to the sea
I will prevail
I will not fail
To bring life into humanity
My song is creation
I've been through the nation
Whispering the wisdom and its purity

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Ocean lovers who like to harmonize
They're all cousins friends and brothers
And they make their Mamas cry
They're record-making heart-breaking
Just West Coast boys
What I know it's a beginning of an endless harmony
Striped shirt freedom
Brave new worlds
Go out on the road
Where there's mid-sixties screaming
And that night time holiday scheming
While a lifestyle turns to gold
Music's growing
And vibrations showing
What's it all mean
I know it means there's an endless harmony

[Outro]
And we sang God bless America
It's a land where we tour
She takes great care of us
And people love for where we sing
We sing doot doo doot, doot doo doot, doot doo doo doo

[Verse]
Old man river
Old man river
He must say something (he don't know nothing)
He don't say nothing
He just keeps rolling along
He keeps on rolling along
He don't plant taters
He don't plant cotton
And them that plants them
Are soon forgotten
That old man river
He keeps on rolling along
I wonder what she see in me
I wonder what she see in me
Yes I wonder what she sees me

I said I wonder what she sees me
I wonder what she sees me
I wonder what she sees me
Yes I wonder what she sees me
I got pistols all around da house
Drug dealer's in my living room
Pounds stash every where
You know that I'm trappin' boo'
I've been selling dope since high school
Tokin ah pistol everywhere
I swear baby I hold you down
I Dare ah Nigga.Dare ah Nigga.Dare ah Nigga
Double Dare
I guess it's just the G' in me
Do you plan your mama meeting me'
I know your daddy don't agree with me
Your baby brother smoking weed with me'
And I wonder what she see in me
I know she see the G in me
Do you plan your mama meeting me
Forever she will be with me

But I wonder what she see in me
Every time she look at me
The judge he wanna throw the book at me
I guess lil mama love's the crook me
And we will be together hopefully
But I'm not too aggressive forcefully
I woke up she say she's loving me
Tomorrow probably be the worst for me
But I wonder what she see in me
I wonder what she see in me
There's no place that she rather be
Then right here smokin' weed with me

She's right here sippin' lean with me
We gone off on A molly'
She's the life of all The party
Real boss don't get her started
But I wonder what she see in me
I wonder what she see in me
Do you have on plan's on leaving me?
Do you think that you'll be breaking me
But there ain't no way that you'll be takin' me
I gotta keep that strap with m

[Verse 1]
I saw some surfer girls in west L.A
And right away it got me thinking about my high school days
Well I was always kind of shy you know I never learned to dance
And I remember being nervous I was scared to take a chance
And it happened it was looking through my mamma's things
I found some rock and roll records and I learned to sing!

[Chorus 2]
Rock and roll to the rescue
Rock and roll to the rescue
Rock to the rescue
I said it rescued me
And it'll rescue you

[Verse 2]
Now believe it when I tell you that I never felt alive
Not till the night I started rocking to my mamma's 45
Well it was one for the money now and two for the show
Baby you better get already now and go cat go!
Yeah the long tall Sally got me bopping around the room
She sing be bop wadda loo bop a-whop bam boom

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 3]
So we got a band together now we're really quite the rage
Oh how I lose my inhibitions when I move across the stage
We're the hottest ticket going what a fantasy flight
They tell me fifty thousand people come to see us every night

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 1]
There's some talk going 'round town
That you really don't give a damn
They say you really put me down
When I'm doing the best I can
I gave you all of my love
I even gave you my body
Tell me, baby, ain't that enough?
What more do you want me to do?
I play the fool when we're together
But I cry when we're apart, yeah
I couldn't do you no better
Don't break what left of my broken heart, baby

[Chorus]
Why you wanna treat me so bad
When you know I love you?
How can you do this to me
When you know I care?
Why you wanna treat me so bad
When you know I love you?

[Verse 2]
You know, I try so hard
To keep you satisfied
Sometimes you play the part
Sometimes you're so full of pride
And if it's still good to you
Why you wanna treat me so bad?
You used to love it when I'd do you
You used to say I was the best you'd ever had
I play the fool when we're together
I give you everything I can, yeah
And if it's still good to you
There's just something that I can't understand

[Chorus]
Why you wanna treat me so bad
When you know I love you?
How can you do this to me
When you know I care?
Why you wanna treat me so bad
When you know I love you?

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
Adieu Emile, my trusted friend
We've known each other since we were 9 or 10
Together we climbed hills and trees
Learned of love and ABCs
Skinned our hearts and skinned our knees
Adieu Emile, it's hard to die
When all the birds are singing in the sky
Now that the spring is in the air
Pretty girls are everywhere
Think of me and I'll be there

[Chorus]
We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun
But the hills that we climbed were just seasons out of time
We had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun
But the hills that we climbed were just seasons out of time

[Verse 2]
Adieu Papa please pray for me
I was the black sheep of the family
You tried to teach me right from wrong
Too much wine and too much song
Wondered how I got along
Adieu Papa it's hard to die (ahhh, ahh, ahh)
When all the birds are singing in the sky (ahhh, ahh, ahh)
Now that the spring is in the air (ahhh, ahh, ahh)
Little children everywhere (ahhh, ahh, ahh)
When you see them I'll be there (ba ba)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Adieu Francoise, my trusted wife
Without you I'd have had a lonely life
You cheated lots of times but then
I forgave you in the end
Though your lover was my friend
Adieu Francoise it's hard to die (ahhh, ahh, ahh)
When all the birds are singing in the sky (ahhh, ahh, ahh)
Now that the spring is in the air (ahhh, ahh, ahh)
With your lovers everywhere (ahhh, ahh, ahh)
Just be careful I'll be there (ba, ba)

[Outro]
All our lives we had fun, we had seasons in the sun (ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba ba ba)
But the stars we could reach were just starfish on the beach (ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba ba ba)
All our lives we had fun, we had seasons in the sun (ba ba ba, ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba ba ba)
But the stars we could reach were just starfish on the beach (ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba)

[Verse 1]
I never been one to hide my feelings
Baby, you blow my mind
I painted your face upon my ceiling
I stare at it all the time
I imagine myself inside your bedroom
Oh, I imagine myself in your sky
(You) you are the reason there's bass in my boom
(Oh, you) you are the reason I'm high

[Pre-Chorus]
If you and I were just ten feet closer
Then I'd make you understand
That everything I wanna do to your body, baby
I would do to your hand
Then you'd be hip to the deep rush
Deeper than the boom of the bass
With every other flick of the pink plush
The closer we get to the space
(The closer we get to the space)

[Chorus]
The space
The space
The space
Don't you want to go? (The space)
Where the souls go (The space)
Where the tears flow (The space)
Where the love grows
Do you want to go?

[Verse 2]
I never been one for this thing obsession
But just keep your eye on my hips
The circles they may be my confession
Just say the word and I'll strip
I've had dreams of us cuddling on the planet Mars
Then when I wake up, I'm all covered in sex
With eyes that fall somewhere between rubies and stars
Don't look at me, baby, or I'll flex

[Pre-Chorus]
If you and I were just ten feet closer
Then I'd make you understand
That everything I wanna do to your body, baby
I would do to your hand
Then you'd be hip to the deep rush
Deeper than the boom of the bass
With every other flick of the pink plush
The closer we get to the space

[Chorus]
(The space) Go
(The space) Flow
(The space) Grow
Don't you want to go? (The space)
Where the souls go (The space)
Where the tears flow (The space)

[Intro]
In that soulful old man sunshine
Do-do-do

[Verse]
She looks so fresh and sweet, keeps herself soft and tender
No wonder that I can sing a song about my baby
She looks so healthy, I feel so doggone wealthy
No wonder that I can sing a song about my baby
So happy, together love is better in that soulful old man sunshine
She wakes up singing songs, of happy ever afters
Well let me just tell you about my ever-loving lady
One bright September, I can remember
The morning we walked together laughing in the sunshine

[Bridge]
Hey old man shine your love on me
Hey old man shine your love on me
Soulful old man shunshine shine your light divine on me
Hey old man shine your love on me
Then suddenly the light shines through and I see you there standing before me
Today the world is new I feel so high and so far within you, yeah

[Outro]
Morning and evening, my love is weaving
A magical thread of joy that joins our hearts together
So happy, together love is better in that soulful old man sunshine

[Verse 1]
When we're dancing close and slow
I never want to let you go, no, no
I feel your warm embrace
The softness of your face
Tell me, baby, are we here alone?

[Verse 2]
When we're kissing long and hard
I can almost taste the thoughts within your mind
Sex-related fantasy is all that my mind can see
Baby, that's honestly the way I feel

[Verse 3]
When we're dancing close and slow
I'm not afraid to let my feelings show
I want to come inside of you
I want to hold you when we're through
Can't you feel my love touching you?

[Spoken Intro]
Come
Lie down beneath my shadow
Lie down beneath my shadow with great delight
And you feel will be sweet to me
Come
My left hand under your head
While my right embraces time
Therein, my virgin, love's wine

[Loop Repeated In Background]
Pheromone make a nigga go crazy
Fuckin' around make a nigga wanna die

[Intro]
L is for lust
O is for obsession
V is for the vast way you envelop my soul
This is crazy, this is crazy
I could die from the pheromone

[Verse 1]
I can see the castle, I can see the throne
I can see the beloved and she's not alone
But it's cool like that
'Cause I'll be digging her just the same

I can see the curtain wrestled from the wall
I can see her hands tied, I can see it all
He pulls a gat
This is how they play the game
And I'm around the back
'Cause curiosity, it knows no shame

[Chorus]
Pheromone, rush over me like an ocean
Pheromone, controlling my every motion
Pheromone, I'm helpless as a pet
Pheromone, when your body's wet

[Verse 2]
I can feel the tension through the crack in the door
He begs for love while she's disgusted more
And I'm on fire, 'cause I never seen her nude before
I wanna save her (save her)
I want for watch (watch)
All my vital signs go up a couple of notches
When he unties her and she runs to the open door
He trips and grinds her (grinds her)
Right there all on the floor (on the floor)
She's so close I can touch her (touch her)

[Chorus]
Pheromone, rush over me like an ocean
Pheromone, controlling my every motion
Pheromone, I'm helpless as a pet
Pheromone, when your body's wet

[Bridge]
Her eyes are closed but there's no penetration
He just makes her point the pistol to his nose
While he masturbates and now I see a tear
Heading down towards her smile
What happens next, it all depends upon your style

[Spoken Interlude]
Oh, this is crazy baby

[Chorus]
Pheromone, rush over me like an ocean
Pheromone, controlling my every motion
Pheromone, I'm helpless as a pet
Pheromone, when your body's wet
Pheromone, rush over me like an ocean
Pheromone, controlling my every motion
Pheromone, I'm helpless as a pet
Pheromone, when your body's wet

[Verse 1]
I've held your hand so many times
But I still get the feeling I felt the very first time
I've kissed your lips and laid with you
And I cherish every moment we spend in each other's arms
I guess my eyes can only see as far as you
I only want to be with you

[Verse 2]
We've come so far in so little time
Sometimes I wonder if this is meant to be
Sometimes you are so very kind
That the nights you're not with me I'm scared
That you're gonna leave
I guess you could say that I'm just being a fool
But I only want to be with you

[Outro]
I guess you could say that I'm just being a fool
But I always, always want to be with you

[Verse 1]
I knew from the start
That I loved you with all my heart
But you were untrue
You had another lover and she looked just like you

[Chorus]
Bambi, can't you understand?
Bambi, it's better with a man

[Verse 2]
It's so hard to believe
Maybe it's because you're so young
Or maybe I'm just too naive
Who's to say, maybe you're really having fun

[Chorus]
Bambi, can't you understand?
Bambi, it's better with a man

[Verse 3]
All your lovers - they look just like you
But they can only do the things that you do
Come on, baby, and take me by the hand
I'm gonna show what it's like to be loved by a man

[Outro]
Bambi, I know what you need
Bambi, maybe you need to bleed
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
All my friends tell me
About the loves they've had
Can't they see what they're doing to me?
It makes me feel so bad
Cause I'm so alone
And brokenhearted
It ain't like my life is ended
But more like it never started
The love my friends rap about I keep anticipating
I try so hard but don't you know, my patience is fading away

[Chorus]
Still waiting
I'm waiting for that love
Still waiting
I wish on every star above
Still waiting
Waiting for the love to come around
Oh, love
Waiting for the love to come around

[Verse 2]
People say that I'm too young
Too young to fall in love
But they don't know, they really don't know
That's all that I've been dreaming of
'Cause I spend my nights just a-crying
And I spend my days just a-trying
To find that love to call my own
'Cause I'm sick and tired of being alone

[Chorus]
Still waiting
Waiting for that love
Still waiting
I wish on every star above
Still waiting
I'm waiting for the love to come around
(Waiting for the love) Don't you know that I'm waiting
(Waiting for the love) Say
(Waiting for the love) To come around now

[Bridge]
I need somebody to hold on to baby
Waiting and waiting, don't you know that I'm

[Outro]
Still waiting
I'm waiting for the love, sugar
Still waiting
If you're out there girl, please come to me
Still waiting
Don't make me cry no more
Still waiting
If you're out there, baby, please come to me
Still waiting
Wishing and wishing for days, baby
Still waiting
If you're out there, girl, please come to me
Still waiting

[Intro]
I wanna top the rose petals that whisper sweet
Come on

[Chorus]
So dark, dark, so dark
So dark, dark, so dark

[Verse 1]
Inside looking out my window
I don't see nothing but rain
Sun up in the sky just a shining (just a shining)
Still I'm lost in my shadow of pain

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Like an innocent man that's on death row
I don't understand what made you go
And wanna leave me baby
Leave me in the dark

[Ad Lib]
Can you tell me, tell me?

[Verse 2]
You took my sex and my money (money)
Took all my self esteem, yes you did
You had the nerve to think it was funny (funny)
I never knew a bitch so mean, yes sir

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You absolutely drove a man to tears
All I really know is that you sincerely
You wanna hurt me baby, oh yes you do
You wanna hurt me in the dark

[Interlude]
(Sunshine) Somebody make the sun shine
(Dark cloud) Somebody take this dark cloud away

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Just as sure as Noah built the ark
That's how sure
That's how sure I am you broke my heart

[Ad lib]
How could you, babe?
Leave me in the dark?
Baby

[Chorus]
So dark, dark, so dark

[Interlude]
Feel like the sun ain't never going to shine
You left me in the dark

[Chorus]
So dark, dark, so dark

[Interlude]
I don't know
I din't know why we ever had to part, Baby
Can't see a damn thing...

[Chorus]
So dark, dark, so dark

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I want to curse the ground you walk on
Even when I know that everything you feel I feel it too
I wanna curse you, baby, ooh
You left me in the dark

And now I want too I want to curse you, baby
For leaving me alone, alone, alone
You left me in the dark, ooh, yes you did
And now all I wanna say is

[Breakdown]
In the dark
Ow, you left me
Ow, you left me
It's like being on death row (in the dark)
I don't understand why you had to go
I don't understand why you (hurt me in the dark)
Don't understand why you (hurt me in the dark)
Don't understand why you hurt me (hurt me, hurt me)
Hurt me (hurt me in, hurt me in)
Hurt me, hurt me (hurt me in the dark)
Just leave me (in the dark)
(In the dark)

[Chorus]
So dark, dark, so dark
So dark, dark, so dark

Baby, baby, when I look at you
I get a warm feeling inside
There's something about the things you do

[Intro]
He liked to frequent this club down up on 36th
Pimps and thangs like to hang outside and cuss for kicks

[Verse 1]
Talking to no one in particular, they say: "The baddest I am tonight"
Four letter words are seldom heard with such dignity and bite
All the poets and the part time singers always hang inside
Live music from a band plays a song called "Soul Psychodelicide"
The song's a year long and had been playing for months when he
Walked into the place
No one seemed to care, an introverted this-is-it look on most of their faces
Up on the mic repeating to words, over and over again
Was this woman he had never noticed before he lost himself in the
Articulated manner in which she said them
These two words, a little bit behind the beat
I mean just enough to turn you on
For every time she said the words another one of his doubts were gone

[Verse 2]
Should he try to rap with her? Should he stand and stare?
No one else was watching her, she didn't seem to care
So over and over, she said the words til he could take no more, (no more)
He dragged her from the stage and together they ran through the back door
In the alley over by the curb he said tell me what's your name
She only said the words again and it started to rain (Rain, rain, rain)
Two words falling between the drops and the moans of his condition
Holding someone is truly believing there's joy in repetition
There's joy in repetition
There's joy in repetition
There's joy in repetition
There's joy in repetition
She said love me, love me, what she say?
She say love me, love me
Joy, why don't you love me baby, joy, why can't you love me baby
Joy, come on and love me baby, joy in repetition
Alright, joy in repetition
Alright, joy in repetition
Alright, joy in repetition
Alright, joy, all my wishes add up to one
Love me, joy, Love me, joy, Love me, joy
Love me, Love me, joy, joy, joy in repetition
Joy, joy in repetition
Joy, joy (love me) in repetition
Love me, love, joy, joy, joy in repetition
Joy, and I'm gonna say it again, joy, joy, and I'm gonna say it again
Joy, I'd like to go way up high and say, Love me, joy
I'll say Love me, joy
Joy, joy in repetition, joy in repetition
There's joy in repetition

[Verse 1]
There was one September day that Papa worked too hard
First he crucified every dandelion out in the yard
Then he screamed at baby twice for throwing rocks at passing cars
Baby didn't listen, so like a priceless work of art
He got snatched by his Papa who then opened up the closet door
And pushed the four-year-old down, onto the closet floor
Baby cried "I'm sorry, I won't do it no more
Papa said "Yeah, I know, that's what this here's for"

[Chorus 1]
Smack
Ooh Papa
Smack! Smack!
Ooh Papa, Papa
Smack
Ooh Papa
Smack! Smack
Ooh Papa, Papa

[Verse 2]
As the door closes, baby starts to cry
"Please don't lock me up again, without a reason why"
Papa just went outside and pointed a shotgun up in the sky
He said "How come I don't love my woman?"
Then he took aim and died

[Chorus 2]
Boom!
Papa
Boom! Boom!
Papa, Papa
Boom!
Papa
Boom! Boom!
Papa, Papa

[Outro]
Don't abuse children, or else they turn out like me

Fair to partly crazy, deep down we're all the same
Every single one of us knows some kind of pain
In the middle of all that's crazy, this one fact still remains
If you love somebody, your life won't be in vain
And there's always a rainbow, at the end of every rain

[Verse 1]
We've been together for quite some time
I'd think by now you'd know
It would take forever to get you off my mind
If ever you decide to go
I guess I got a little insecurity when it's concerning you
I guess I'm just afraid that if you ever leave
I'd be in a messed-up state of blue

[Chorus]
And I'd be so lonely
Without you loving me
I know it's gonna be lonely
Without you giving me every little single thing that I need
Lonely

[Verse 2]
Whatever's in your kiss, it really turns me on
'Til I go right out of my mind
And who could ever resist your accent from Paris
It gets me every time
I betcha that you never knew that in my dreams
You are the star
The only bummer is that you always want to leave
Who do you think you are

[Chorus]
Don't you know it's gonna be lonely
Without you loving me
I know it's gonna be lonely
Without you giving me every little single thing that I need
Lonely

It's gonna be lonely
Without you loving me
Giving me everything that I need
Oh pretty baby, can't you see
It's gonna be lonely

Without you loving me
I know, I know it's gonna be lonely

Oh, whatever's in your kiss
I never could resist
Oh, baby don't go!

We've been together for quite some time
It'd take forever to get you off my mind
Oh, girl!

Without you loving me
I know it's gonna be lonely
Without you by my side
Don't you know that I could die, baby
Without you loving me
Can't you see
It's gonna be lonely

It's gonna be lonely, baby
So lonely, baby

[Intro]
Lie down, fair one, and come away
Till the rain is over and gone
G-G-Gimme the beat now (Face the music)
Lead line (Face the music)

[Verse 1]
If the air is a little thick in this room tonight
I reckon it's the result of an onslaught of separatist rookies
Overcome by this colorful sight
Talking so fast that even they
Talking so fast that even they
Don't know what they mean
Of all the things that base a rhyme
How is it that you every time
Regurgitate the racist lines that keep us apart?
Thank God this ain't Monopoly
You'd make us all go back to start

[Chorus]
Race
In the space I mark human (Face the music)
Race
Face the music
We all bones when we dead
Race
In the space I mark human (Face the music)
Cut me, cut you
Both the blood is red
I gotcha
Race
Race
Check it

[Verse 2]
Three seats over there's a lady black
Entrusted to her care is a little white girl
And the fact of the matter is
Before her mama or another kid at school
Tells her about the fallacy that one race rules over the other
She'd be a much-better-off-left fool (Face the music)
If we never heard about the evils that those before us committed
Then how my dear, tell me now how my dear, tell me now how now would we know
And then the band say

[Chorus]
Race
In the space I mark human (Face the music)
Race
Face the music
We all bones when we dead
Race
In the space I mark human (Face the music)
Cut me, cut you
Both the blood is red
I gotcha

[Verse 3]
D-d-down with H-I-S-T-O-R-Y and all this BS propagandi
Keepin you from me and me from you as we grow
I don't wanna know (I don't wanna know)
Why those before us hated each other
I'd rather believe they never did
I'd rather believe (I'd rather, I'd rather believe)
That there's hope for a kid
And if he imitates the best
I guess that's what I'll try to be
And I will let the rest dissolve with my guitar underneath the sea

[Chorus]
Race
In the space I mark human (Face the music)
Race
Face the music
We all bones when we dead
Race
In the space I mark human (Face the music)
Cut me, cut you
Both the blood is red
Get it?

[Outro]
Got it

[Verse 1]
We met when she was younger
Then I had no eyes for her
A few years went by and I saw her
Now I'm gonna try for her
Look out, babe

[Chorus]
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew

[Verse 2]
How could I ever have known that
She'd be what she is today
And look at how her boyfriend holds her
I'll be moving in one day
Split, man

[Chorus]
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew
She's not the little girl I once knew

[Bridge]
La doo day pow pow pow
La doo day pow pow pow

Maybe we'll unlock the
Secrets of your mind

[Interlude]
The passion's in the mix (Serve it up, Sheila)
Drink it quick - Cindy, shit
Where'd you get that beauty mark?
Maybe you and I should be undressing
Don't all girls look the same?
They don't?
Oh, what a shame
Cindy, Cindy
I'll pay the usual fee
What's the matter, don't you like me?
(help me tell me what it's all about)

[Verse 3]
I'm talking about a long crucial wait (Cindy C Listen)
Girl, if I have to beg (She's so tired)
I'm gonna see you in (Look at me)
Your birthday suit tonight (She doesn't look as good as I do)
I'm sure you're quite intelligent (you think she does, but think again. See?)
A whiz at math and all that shit (how 'bout that?)
But I'm, I'm a tad more interested (Ah ha ha look it)
(She can't even walk in those shoes)
(I can walk better than that)
In flyin' your kite tonight (She can't even dance)
Cindy, is that alright? (I would give somethin' to know)

Oohhh Cindy C, will you play with me?
I'll pay the usual fee

Help me (aaww shit)

[Bridge]
Excuse my savoir faire
But, baby I'm dying to take you everywhere (Oh yeah?)
I wanna show you to my friends
Because baby, you're the living end (Tell me now)
Let me have a debt worth winning
I can feel your ice is thinning
Like a frozen pond in spring
Your furry melting thing awaits me
Your furry melting thing awaits me, (Oh Cindy C)
And my six-string (Will you play with me?)

[Chorus]
(Cindy, where are you?)
C'mon Cindy (Oh my God)
C'mon Cindy (Wait)
Don't you want to play with me? (Ah, yes, no, wait)
Don't you want to play with me? (Yes)
What's the matter with me, Cindy? (Nothing)

[Spoken]
Oh Cindy C, won't you play with me?

[Rap: Cat Glover]
Music is the key to set yourself free
From depression, drugs and increasing poverty
The key is to the lock, the lock is on the door
The door has a knob that you've never turned before
The jack, use the jack, it opens up the lock
Cuz there's the key to unlock the body
Place it like that to open up the door
The door to the house full of people galore
The beat won't stop 'til the JM jocks
And he jacks the box 'til the party rocks
The clock tick-tocks and the place gets hot
And believe it or not, all the troubles you forgot
It's just that easy if you want it to be
For all the fellas, and the young ladies
So ease your mind and set yourself free
To the mystifying music that we call Cindy C

[Outro]
Oh Cindy C, won't you play with me?
Oh Cindy C

[Intro]
Ooh, I can't hold it
Ow! Bang, b-b-bang, bang
Bang

[Verse 1]
You, yeah
You're such a big tease, you get me all excited
All excited then you go home
You're like ice cream
Knew I got to get you, got to get you, before you're all gone

[Chorus]
You're such a bombshell
And if I ever get you, ever get you, ever get you
There's no telling how long I'd last
Before I tick, tick bang all over you
Tick, tick-a-tick, bang, bang all over you
Tick, tick-a-tick, bang, bang, bang, tick, bang, bang

[Verse 2]
You are no cheap thrill
Every time you tick I'd rather you bang
But you leave me in a fire sweat (leave me in a fire sweat)
You're like a good pill
All I need is to, and I'm so into you, you're the best stuff that I could get

[Chorus]
You're such a bombshell
And if I ever get you, ever get you, ever get you
There's no telling how long I'd last
Before I tick, tick bang all over you
Tick, tick-a-tick, bang, bang all over you
Tick, tick-a-tick, bang, bang, bang, tick, bang, bang

[Bridge]
Ooh, I can't hold it
Ooh, it's getting all over me
Ooh, I can't hold it
Ooh, it's getting all over me

[Verse 3]
You're such a queen bee
Let me taste your honey, taste your honey, taste your honey, for it go bad
You're so slippery
Like this chain around my hip, I want a 24k relationship
So baby don't spit me out, tick, tick, bang, all over you
Tick, tick-a-tick, bang
Ooh, I can't hold it. Ooh, it's getting all over me

[Chorus]
You're such a bombshell
And if I ever get you, ever get you, ever get you
There's no telling how long I'd last
Before I tick, tick bang all over you
Tick, tick-a-tick, bang, bang all over you
Tick, tick-a-tick, bang, bang, bang, tick, bang, bang
So low, the curb looks like a skyscraper
So high, the stars are under me
So quiet, I can hear the blood rushing through my veins
So low, I feel like I'm going insane

The angels, they watch in wonder
When you made love to me
Through the rain and the thunder
You cried in ecstasy

And you were so kind
I felt sorry for all creation
Because at the time, no one was lucky
No one was lucky, no one was lucky as me

And now you're gone and I just wanna be still
So silent, I'll just let my senses sleep
It's going to be so hard to hear my voice
If I ever learn once more to speak

I'm so lost, no one can find me
And I've been looking for so long
But now I'm done
I'm so low, solo, my name is no one

[Verse 1]
I had a dream I was mugged outside your house
I had a dream in a panic you came running out
For a moment you were sure I'd die on you
For a moment I believed you loved me too
But life is never like this, and you were never strong

[Chorus]
Too much of a good thing won't be good for long
Although you made my heart sing, to stay with you would be wrong
Too much of a good thing won't be good anymore
Watch where I tread before I fall

[Verse 2]
We talk maybe twenty times a day
And still I never say what I want to say
I thought I wouldn't need to
I guess I read you wrong

[Chorus]
Too much of a good thing won't be good for long
Although you made my heart sing, to stay with you would be wrong
Too much of a good thing won't be good anymore
Watch where I tread before I fall

[Bridge]
You refuse to see this, don’t see it anymore
I have made a decision not to answer your calls
Cause I put everything out there and I got nothing at all

[Outro]
Too much of a good thing isn't good and you know
I watch where I walk before I fall
Before I fall

[Intro]
It's the little old lady from Pasadena

[Verse 1]
It's the little old lady from Pasadena
(Go granny, go granny, go granny, go!)
Has a pretty little flower bed of white gardenias
(Go granny, go granny, go granny, go!)
But parked in a rickety old garage
Is a brand new shiny red super stocked Dodge

[Chorus]
And everybody's saying that there's nobody meaner
Than the little old lady from Pasadena
She drives real fast and she drives real hard
She's the terror of Colorado Boulevard
It's the little old lady from Pasadena

[Verse 2]
If you see her on the street just getting her kicks now
(Go granny, go granny, go granny, go!)
With her four speed stick and a four-two-six now
(Go granny, go granny, go granny, go!)
She's going to get a ticket now sooner or later
Because she can't keep her foot off the accelerator

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Verse 3]
You'll see her all the time don't try to choose her
(Go granny, go granny, go granny, go!)
You might drive a go-er but you'll never lose her
(Go granny, go granny, go granny, go!)
The guys come to race her from all around
But she'll give them a length then she'll shut them down

[Chorus]

[Outro]
(Go granny, go granny, go granny, go!)

[Verse 1]
I don't have much to give, but I don't care for gold
What use is money, when you need someone to hold?
Don't have direction, I'm just rolling down this road
Waiting for you to bring me in from out the cold

[Pre-Chorus]
You'll never know the endless nights
The rhyming of the rain
Or how it feels to fall behind
And watch you call his name

[Chorus]
Pack up and leave everything
Don't you see what I can bring?
Can't keep this beating heart at bay
Set my midnight sorrow free
I will give you all of me
Just leave your lover, leave him for me
Leave your lover, leave him for me

[Verse 2]
We sit in bars and raise our drinks to growing old
Oh, I'm in love with you and you will never know
But if I can't have you I'll walk this life alone
Spare you the rising storm and let the rivers flow

[Pre-Chorus]
You'll never know the endless nights
The rhyming of the rain
Or how it feels to fall behind
And watch you call his name

[Chorus]
Pack up and leave everything
Don't you see what I can bring?
Can't keep this beating heart at bay
Set my midnight sorrow free
I will give you all of me
Just leave your lover, leave him for me
Leave your lover, leave him for me

[Verse]
Our Father
Which art in heaven
Hallowed be
Thy name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done
On earth
As it is
In heaven
Give us this day our daily bread
And forgive us
Our debts
As we forgive our debtors
And lead us not
Into temptation
But deliver us
From evil
For Thine
Is the kingdom
And the power
And the glory
Forever
Amen!
Amen!

[Chorus]
Love, come quick
Love, come in a hurry
There are thieves in the temple, tonight

[Verse 1]
They don't care where they kick
Just as long as they hurt you
There are thieves in the temple, tonight
Love, if you're there, come save me
From all this cold despair
I can hang when you're around
But I'll surely die if you're not there

[Chorus]
Love, come quick
Love, come in a hurry
There are thieves in the temple, tonight

[Verse 2]
I feel like they're looking for my soul (Soul)
Like a poor man looking for gold (Gold)
There are thieves in the temple, tonight
Voices from the sky say, "Rely
On your best friend to pull you through"
But even if I wanted to, I couldn't really, truly
'Cause my only friend is you
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, come on

[Chorus]
There are thieves in the temple, tonight

[Verse 3]
Kicking me in my heart
Tearing me all apart (Tearing me, tearing me)
(Tearing me, tearing me all apart)
'Cause me and you could have been
A work of art (Thieves in the temple)

[Bridge]
Baby, don't you know I'm holding on
The best that I can
Love, please help me be
The better man
Better than the thieves
(Thieves in the temple)
In the temple, tonight
Oh, thieves in the temple
(Tonight) Tonight, hurt me

[Chorus]
Love, come quick
Love, come in a hurry
There are thieves in the temple, tonight
(Thieves in the temple)

[Outro]
You said you loved me (Thieves in the temple)
You said I was your friend (Thieves in the temple)
You were supposed to take care of me
Love come quick (Thieves in the temple)
You lie! Lie! Lie! (Love, come in a hurry)
(Thieves in the temple, tonight)

[Intro: Vanity and Prince]
Ready or not, here I come
Come on
Come on

[Verse 1: Prince]
All my life I've kept my feelings deep inside
Never was a reason to let somebody know
"Lover here, lover there" - Who cried? Who cared? Foolish pride
"Never was a good seat at any of this man's shows"

[Pre-Chorus: Prince]
Until now all I wanted to do is
Do do do what I do, and
Bang bang bang on the drummer
And love so-and-so

[Chorus: Prince]
But now I've got to let it go (let it go)
Lay back and let the vibe just flow
I wanna just let it go (let it go)
Lay back and let my feelings show (let it go)
I'm ready for the real
Give me something I can feel

[Verse 2: Prince]
All my life this heart's been under lock and key
My curtains were drawn, there wasn't nobody home
Trigger here, Trigger there - everybody's high except for me
Better off dead if I couldn't be alone

[Pre-Chorus: Prince]
Until now all I wanted to do is
Do do do what I do, and
Bang bang bang on the drummer
And love so-and-so

[Chorus: Prince]
But now I've got to let it go (let it go)
Lay back and let the vibe just flow
I wanna just let it go (let it go)
Lay back and let my feelings show (let it go)
I'm ready for the real
Give me something I can feel

[Verse 3: Prince]
Fourteen years and tears I've longed to sing my song
But a horse couldn't drag your ass to put me on
But now I've got an army and we're three million strong
This song will ring in your ears when we are gone

[Pre-Chorus: Prince]
Until now all I wanted to do is
Do do do what I do, and
Bang bang bang on the drummer
And love so-and-so

[Chorus: Prince]
But now I've got to let it go (let it go)
Lay back and let the vibe just flow
I wanna just let it go (let it go)
Lay back and let my feelings show (let it go)
I'm ready for the real
Give me something I can feel

[Outro: Prince]
I am ready for the real
Come a little closer
Let it go
Lay back an' let the vibe just flow

[Spoken]
Come on
Come on
Don't be shy, it's only you and I
Isn't that what you want?
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Come on then
Keep going
Keep going
Oh yeah
Keep going
Yeah
Yeah, here I come
Now
Come
Imagine what you look like from across the room
You're almost there
Come
Oh yeah

[Outro]
I love you

[Intro]
Hey, yeah

[Verse 1]
Carjack used to fix flat tires
Cadillac used to be a Benz
Big joints never gotcha higher
Freebase cost you in the end

[Chorus]
I'm just a no-name reporter
I wish I had nothing to say
Looking through my new camcorder
Trying to find a crime that pays
I get hit by mortars, everywhere I go I'm loitering
Chaos and disorder ruining my world today

[Verse 2]
He's gay, used to mean he's happy
Nowadays happy ain't allowed
You're played, used to mean top forty
Now forty days of being played ain't proud

[Chorus]
I'm just a no-name reporter
I wish I had nothing to say
Looking through my new camcorder
Trying to find a crime that pays
I get hit by mortars, everywhere I go I'm loitering
Chaos and disorder ruining my world today

[Refrain]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Safe sex used to mean no babies
When intercourse used to mean fun
If I had fifteen ladies
I would only fuck with one

[Chorus]
I get hit by a mortar, everywhere I go I'm loitering
Chaos and disorder ruining my world today

[Refrain]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I've been sleeping with the lights on
Cause the darkness is surrounding you
This is my world, this is my choice
And you're the drug that gets me through

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been waiting for an answer
Because I built this bed for two
I'm just hanging on your answer
I built this bed for me and you

[Chorus]
Can't you see that I am yours?
So will you be my life support?
You're my life support
You're my life support

[Verse 2]
Sick of waking up in darkness
When the sky is always painted blue
There's a method to my madness
It’s clear that you don’t have a clue

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been waiting for an answer
Because I built this bed for two
I'm just hanging on your answer
I built this bed for me and you

[Chorus]
Can't you see that I am yours?
So will you be my life support?
You're my life support
You're my life support

[Outro]
Can't you see that I am yours?
So will you be my life support?
I've been sleeping with the lights on
Cause the darkness is surrounding you

[Chorus: The Beach Boys & (Annette Funicello)]
Uh, huh, She loves the monkey's uncle
Yeah, yeah, She loves the monkey's uncle
Whoa, whoa, She loves the monkey's uncle
(And the monkey's uncle's ape for me!)

[Verse 1: (The Beach Boys) & Annette Funicello]
I don't care what the whole world thinks!
(She loves the monkey's uncle!)
Call us a couple of "missing links"
(She loves the monkey's uncle!)
Love all these monkeyshines
Every day is Valentine's
I love the monkey's uncle
And the monkey's uncle's ape for me!
(Ape for me!)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: (The Beach Boys) & Annette Funicello]
This in my heart jumps like a clown
(She loves the monkey's uncle!)
Feels like the circus just came to town!
(She loves the monkey's uncle!)
I live in a "jungle gym"
In order to be with him
I love the monkey's uncle
And I wish I were the monkey's aunt!
(Monkey's aunt!)

[Bridge: The Beach Boys & (Annette Funicello)]
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
(On the day he marries me)

[Both]: What a nutty family tree!
A bride!
A groom!
A chimpanzee!

[Verse 3: (The Beach Boys) & Annette Funicello]
Let them say he's the booby prize!
(She loves the monkey's uncle!)
He is the guy I idolize!
(She loves the monkey's uncle!)
Love all those monkeyshines
Every day is Valentine's
I love the monkey's uncle
And the monkey's uncle's ape for me!
(Ape for me!)

[Outro: The Beach Boys & Annette Funicello]
Uh, huh, She (I) loves (love) the monkey's uncle
Yeah, yeah, She (I) loves (love) the monkey's uncle
Whoa, whoa, She (I) loves (love) the monkey's uncle
And I'm mad about his chimpanzee!!!

[Verse 1]
You lift my heart up when the rest of me is down
You, you enchant me even when you're not around
If there are boundaries, I will try to knock them down
I’m latching on, babe, now I know what I have found

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel we're close enough
Could I lock in your love?
I feel we’re close enough
Could I lock in your love?

[Chorus]
Now I’ve got you in my space
I won’t let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I’m latching on to you

[Verse 2]
I’m so encaptured, got me wrapped up in your touch
Feel so enamored, hold me tight within your clutch
How do you do it? You got me losing every breath
What did you give me to make my heart beat out my chest?

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel we're close enough
Could I lock in your love?
I feel we’re close enough
Could I lock in your love?

[Chorus]
Now I’ve got you in my space
I won’t let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I’m latching on to you

[Chorus]
Now I’ve got you in my space
I won’t let go of you
Got you shackled in my embrace
I’m latching on to you

I’m latching on to you

[Verse]
There's a story told of a very gentle boy
And the girl who wore his ring
Through the wintery snow
The world they knew was one
For their hearts were full of spring
As the days grew old
And the nights passed into time
And the weeks and years took wind
Gentle boy, tender girl
Their love remained still young
For their hearts were full of spring
Then one day they died
And their graves were side by side
On a hill where robins sing
And they say violets
Grow there the whole year round
For their hearts were full of spring

[Verse 1]
The tired day is gone
The hotel lights are on
There's stillness in the night, the city's sleeping
As you lie there in your bed
A tune stays in your head
This sleepy lullaby comes softly creeping
Since I can't be there tonight
To hold and squeeze you tight
Oh baby

[Chorus]
This song wants to sleep with you
This song wants to sleep with you
This song's going to sleep with you tonight

[Verse 2]
The melody comes near
And whispers in your ear
Through the misty nights some distant train goes reeling
If I could be anywhere
I'd wish that I was there
And if you should hear 'I love you' that's me singing
This song's a little blue
Because songs get lonely too
Whoa baby

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Soft serenade, gives you soul sweet dreams
Pull down the shade, nothing's wrong
(Can't you feel it, can't you feel it)
Guardian angels watch, over you at night
That's really me, and my song, and my soul
The telephone wires hiss
To bring someone a kiss
This melancholy tune is softly fading
Sweet dreams keep coming on
Deep into the dawn
Oh baby

[Chorus]

[Outro]
This sleepy lullaby comes softly creeping
This melancholy tune is softly fading
Oh, whoa oh
(This song's going to sleep with you
This song's going to sleep with you)

[Verse 1]
I've got to get out of here
This town’s no longer fun
And I’m falling closer, falling closer
Closer to the sun
I've got to get out of here
Come kiss another face
Cause it hurts too bad, it hurts too bad
And I don’t like the taste

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You say it’s over, leaving me so far from sober
Now sun is colder, I lean on a stranger’s shoulder
I walk the streets and there are beats and cities smoulder
Without a trace I’m under

[Chorus]
And God knows I try
Looking for lovers at night
But each time I do
It only reminds me of you
It only reminds me of you

[Verse 2]
I've got to get out of here
Cause you never want me back
You are moving on, moving on
And I’m stuck on the track
I've gotta get out of here
Before I self-destruct
And I don’t want, I don’t want
My heart to ever stop

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I walk the streets and there are beats and cities smoulder
Without a trace I’m under

[Chorus x2]

[Intro]
One two three four

[Verse]
If you see me walking down the street
And I start to cry
(Each time we meet)
Walk on by
Walk on by
Foolish pride
I break down and cry
Cry
Cry

[Verse 1]
Anyone can tell I love you
Anyone can tell I care
Twice an hour I'm thinking of you
Around your waist I want to be there

[Chorus]
On your heavenly body I swear
I like it there

[Verse 2]
Anyone can see what's come over me
Don't you know it's 'cause of you
I'm in a daze but that's the way it's gotta be
Let me count the ways I'm digging you
Digging you, baby
I'm digging you, baby
I hope you're digging me too

[Chorus]
Baby, I like it there
I like it there
I like it there
On your heavenly body I swear
I like it there

[Verse 3]
Can I count the ways that I'm digging you/
I hope you're digging me too

[Chorus]
Baby, I like it there
I like it there
I like it there, that's right
On your heavenly body I swear
I like it there

[Bridge]
Every damn day I please you
What can I say Shakespeare hasn't said before?
Like an embryo, baby
Don't abort this dire need for you
All my emotional ejaculate on the floor (On the floor)
And what's more, what's more
Your heavenly body, baby
I swear (I swear), I swear
I like it there
Yeah

[Chorus]
I like it there
I like it there
I like it there
On your heavenly body I swear
I like it there

[Verse 1]
Dinner with Delores
Must be some kind of sin
Like a Brontosaurus
She was packing it in
The first night we dined
And by the next time
This girl was eating all but the tip

And by the stroke of midnight
She wanted some more (More)
Showing dirty movies
Like some kind of whore
But she was wasting her time
'Cause there wasn't a line
That would make me come 'round her door

[Verse 2]
Dinner with Delores
Must be some kind of sin
Her bell's just a-broken (Bell's just broken)
Since 1984
(Dancing) Dancing like a white girl (White girl)
On disco dirty floors
Damn, Delores, pick another subject please
Introduce the carpet to something other than your knees
Like a real confession
No one could be more made up than you
Nothings left for guessing
What a shame (boo hoo) boo hoo

[Guitar solo]

[Outro]
I'd call you a friend
But it must be a sin
And I've run out of cheeks to turn

Dinner with Delores
No more, that's the end

[Verse 1]
Are you taken by surprise
When your fellow man decides
That what you're doing isn't right
Do you listen, know you're right
Well, you can keep on telling lies
That keep you deaf from people's cries
Well, there's something you should see
We got love to keep us free

[Pre-Chorus]
We got love, we got love
We got love and we going to change our world, that's right
We got love, we got love
We got love and we going to change our world, that's right

[Chorus]
I made my home out in the city
Just to see what I could find
Though my heart was in my country
I was not there to close my eyes
Said, I've been tired of all the same
Must've been a Siren in my head
I've been riding all my feelings
All this running and my temperature won't change

[Verse 2]
Say, you reap just what you sow
The wise men all have told us so
Trust those feelings deep within
How you must treat your fellow man
Evolution isn't strange
Nature itself demands a change
The universe is on our side
We can't hold back the coming tide

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Once was this ball
With a line straight down the middle
One side was black and the other one white
And they both understood so little

That they spent their whole lives trying to tell each other what time it was
And all along it did not matter what either said
Because, because

[Chorus]
You only know what you know
You only see what your heart will show
You only love when your soul remembers
We all come from the same December
And in the end, that's where we'll go
So let's go

[Verse 2]
Once was a golden idol that went to the winners
Needless to say it didn't make 'em feel any less a sinner
'Cause the very next morning, the whole damn world was the same, yes it was
The idol's still shining, but the voice inside, it said
"There ain't no winners in this game."

[Chorus]
You only know what you know
You only see what your heart will show
You only love when your soul remembers
We all come from the same December
And in the end, that's where we'll go
So let's go

[Verse 3]
There once was an angel
Who most certainly watched over me
But if it got me through the day
Is it crazy?
Yeah, I'll be crazy

[Bridge]
Until the demons fall as far as anyone can fall
When they reap what they done sowed, I'll be standing tall
We spend our whole lives trying to dog the other man
When what we need to do is try to give him all we can

[Chorus]
You only know what you know, and uh
You only see what your heart will show, and uh
You only love when your soul remembers
We all come from the same December
And in the end, that's where we'll go
So let's go

[Outro]
Let's go

[Intro]
We're together again (oh darling)
We're together again (oh darling)

[Verse]
Out of all the times you made me cry
Out of all the times you made me sigh
Still we're together again (we're together again)
We're together again (we're together again)
I didn't want ever want you to go
Darling I can't help but let the whole world know
That we're together again (we're together again)
We're together, together again

[Bridge]
I didn't mean to ever leave you alone
I didn't mean to ever do you wrong
Now that you're back where you belong
I'm going to love you all night long
We're together again (oh darling)
We're together again (we're together again)

[x4]

[Outro]
Darling
We're together again

[repeat until fade]

I travel the world, city to city don’t know where Imma stop
And I wake up every morning
Like where am I
Where am I

[Verse one: Tyga]
My deadbeat love what he does
For release are kiss and hugs
They offer drugs off to clubs
Cigarettes smoking some bube
But what he does none above
Just watching them drunk is fun
Gotta get buzzed
No groupie love on the tour bus
Knockin on wood take her to the woodshop
Pop plenty much
Livin in this fixer up
Plus the air conditioner sucks
Driver drivin' slow hard this tolls slippery roads now I’m just wishing
I was back at home

[Hook]
I travel the world, city to city don’t know where Imma a stop
And I wake up every morning like where am I
Where am I
Can’t getch yo money don’t even try I fly by
If you looking for me I’m in the sky
Like where am I
Where am I

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Half asleep but still I dream
Wishing she was next to me
But I don’t gotta girlfriend
Tonight Miss Ouri Ashley
She will be come lay with me
We can watch some MTV
Flipping through some magazines
Look it’s me, don’t look at me
I’m to bright to see luminous, don’t you agree?
A man ain’t nothing
'til that man out hustling
Gurl trying to get me busted
Cleand or something sayin
Im in trouble cops lookin for the suspect (what you say?)
Well fuck 'em Cuz I..

[Hook]
I travel the world, city to city don’t know where Imma a stop
And I wake up every morning like where am I
Where am I
Can’t getch yo money don’t even try I fly by
If you looking for me I’m in the sky
Like where am I
Where am I

[Verse 3: Tyga]
Shit, we doing a hundred
I don’t think this prevost is made for it
Feeling the three wheel motion any minute bus flip over
And we’ll be rolling in the road found dead in Oklahoma
Only hung over so he doesn’t notice what’s approaching
Oh shit, here comes eighteen wheeler towing
I’m ready to jump out this motherfucker, driver please let door open
Shit is hopeless
Getting closer
Eyes closing
Collision notices
In the ocean floating where the boats is
Thank god told at least

[Hook]
I travel the world, city to city don’t know where Imma a stop
And I wake up every morning like where am I
Where am I
Can’t getch yo money don’t even try I fly by
If you looking for me I’m in the sky
Like where am I
Where am I

[Outro: Tyga]
Genesis 24:56
Do not detain me, now that the lord has granted success to my journey
Send me on my way
So I may go to my master

[Verse 1]
An Indian woman buried her grandpa in the Black Hills
When she was young he used to tell her
That these hills belonged to her still
And even though injustice took them hills away
"One day we'll get 'em back," he said
"And the sun's gonna shine that day
"When we say, right the wrong

Before she laid him down to rest
She heard his voice in the wilderness
Saying "I got six feet of it back
"And now we can right the wrong

[Chorus]
Right the wrong
Hear the song
Before long you won't hear nothing but the crackle of flames
Right the wrong
Hear the song
Would you rather die knowing that you did or keep living in shame

[Verse 2]
Did you hear the one about the boy just 17
Three years hard time for stealing ice cream
First offense and all his dreams are gone
How long before they right the wrong?

[Chorus]
Right the wrong
Hear the song
Before long you won't hear nothing but the crackle of flames
Right the wrong
Hear the song
Would you rather die knowing that you did or keep living in shame

[Verse 3]
Two, three, uh

One, two, one-two, come on
Right the wrong baby

Far be it from me to say
It seem like we could stop the flow of snow in the sky today
But I guess the weather man he likes the rain
Ain't that insane
Now sing

[Chorus]
Right the wrong
Hear the song
Before long you won't hear nothing but the crackle of flames
Right the wrong
Hear the song
Would you rather die knowing that you did or keep living in shame

[Verse 4]
Come on, come on, come on
Did you hear me baby?
Right the wrong
I'm six feet in the grave
I'm six feet in the grave

[Chorus]
Right the wrong
Hear the song
Before long you won't hear nothing but the crackle of flames
Right the wrong
Hear the song
Would you rather die knowing that you did or keep living in shame

[Outro]
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
(Right the wrong, right the wrong)
This young man with a talented soul
(Right the wrong, right the wrong)
Died when he wanted to
(Right the wrong, right the wrong)
The 

[life/light]that lives
(Right the wrong, right the wrong)
So he shall not be pitied
Nor shall the guilty be forgiven
Until they find it in their hearts to
Right the wrong

Yeah, baby

Watch them attack each and every vulture
Or do you wants forget that P-R-O starts via pro
Teaching things in life you'll never know
What for they dabble they don't understand
They caught me coming from the other Minnesota
My flavour will burn their ears
A-when it comes to music this sir is no stranger
Is the same kids you compliment
The same ones that you were meant
To rob an education from
In a private school as opposed to one
That yearly spits out another group of fools
Into a system designed to fail
Wait a minute, I just got some e-mail
Somebody selling 12 CDs for a dollar
Make me wanna holler (yeah)
Alright to the maximum

[Chorus 2]
I don't need you to tell me what clothes to wear
I don't want suggestions about my hair
If the whole world buys your bullshit I don't care

You fake players walking streets in mean mug
I be making records getting (mmmh) in the hot tub
(Rock) In this Minneapolis snow I'm felling
Ready set to blow up like Mt. Saint Helen
On your cord snoring your flow boring
Sort of like channel 5 at 4 in the morning
(Rock) Adult 

[made under / 

[...] on the par] give up hope
Grab the devil by the throat
Make him play the scapegoat

(Rock) In the running with the bucket of cuttings
Wishing I had duckets to live like Kirby Puckett
(Rock) Here comes the rumors I'm down with NPG
I sign the contract, I'm doing the LP
But woe, what a minute bro' go slow
Ten dollars for the blow, no dollars for the ho
(Rock) In the club trick holding
Looking for a black magic 

[woman gang] strong 

[with/is] dick holding

[Chorus 1]
I rock (rock rock) therefore I am

[Verse 1]
It's just around the corner, it's just around the block
This love that I've been waiting for, a Love solid as rock
A Love that reaffirms that we are not alone
A Love so bright inside you it glows
And night and day would run together, and all things would be fine
Still would stand all hate around us
Still would stand all time
Still would stand all time

[Verse 2]
It's not a thousand years away, it's not that far my brother
When men will fight injustice instead of one another
Its not that far if we all say yes and only try
Then Heaven on Earth we will find

(All time)
(Still, still would stand all time)

[Verse 3]
No one man will be ruler, therefore love must rule us all
Dishonesty, anger, fear, jealousy and greed will fall
Love can save us all

[Verse 4]
Oh, love, Love, oh Love if you would just please give us a sign
Still would stand all time
Heaven, heaven on Earth we all want to find (We all want to find it)
Still (Still) would stand all time

[Verse 5]
We are not alone people (We're not alone)
Tell me can you see the light (Can ya see the light)
If you just open your eyes (Still would stand all time)
So much you will know, so much you will show
Love, Love, its not that far away if we all say yes and give it a try
(Got ta give it...a try...yes!) still would stand all time (I say still)
(So many times) so many times, I thought I could not make it
(Still would stand all time)
Life was closing in I just knew, I just knew I couldn't take it
That's when Love opened it's arms, and if you dont go in child
Still would stand all time (Still would stand all time)
You better run to the light, leave your past behind
All things will be fine
Still would stand all time

[Verse 1]
From out of the darkness, before there was time
There came a sound that enters the mind
Through a door that's deep in your soul
Through every pore of your body it goes
And in a light too bright to behold
Is a truth more shiny than gold

[Chorus]
And as sure as this candle burns
Every soul must return
Into the light, into the light

[Verse 2]
From out of the light there comes a story
Open your mind and feel the glory
What's the hurry to die without trying?
If you could sell your worries (Sell your worries)
Would anyone buy 'em? (Oh no)
And for every flower that grows, even a baby knows

[Chorus]
And as sure as this candle burns
Every soul must return
Into the light, into the light

[Verse 1: Prince]
I will walk this road, I will, I will
It's going to be hard but I know I will, I will
People come and they'll go, but I still, I still
Face up to the truth and just grow, I will, I will

[Verse 2: Prince and Rosie Gaines]
I will fight this fight, I will, I will
I will sleep tonight, I will, I will
I've been down before, but I still, I still
Remember what I came for, I will, I will

[Verse 3: Prince and Rosie Gaines]
I will get to you, I will, I will
And then I'll help you get through, I will, I will
You have preyed on many a fool, until, until
No one cared about you, but I will, I will

[Chorus]
Everybody wants to find Graffiti Bridge
Something to believe in, a reason to believe that there's a heaven above
Everybody wants to find Graffiti Bridge
Everybody's looking for
Everybody's looking for
Everybody's looking for love

[Verse 1]
Everybody wants to find the perfect one
Someone that makes you happy, someone that makes you laugh when you want to cry
Everybody wants to find the perfect one
Everybody's looking for
Everybody's looking for
Everybody's looking for love

[Verse 2]
The love of a boy, the love of a girl
The love that comes from a warm heart in a cold cold world
Everybody wants to find Graffiti Bridge
Something to believe in, a reason to believe that there's a heaven above
Everybody wants to find Graffiti Bridge
Everybody's looking for
Everybody's looking for
Everybody's looking for love

[Chorus]
Everybody wants to find Graffiti Bridge
(people throw away your arms of fire)
A bridge of many colors
A bridge that leads them to a love they know is real
(let democracy take you higher)
Everybody wants to find Graffiti Bridge
Everybody's looking for (if you believe)
Everybody's looking for (wave your hands)
Everybody's looking for love (on the power of love)

(Love is shining)
(everybody wants to find Graffiti Bridge)

There's a future (sure, you're right) a future worth fighting for
I'm a living witness
Everybody wants to find Graffiti Bridge
Ooo, everything's gonna be alright, alright, alright
Everybody's looking for
Everybody's looking for
Everybody's looking for love

[Outro]
There is a future (a future worth fighting for)
Worth fighting for
Yes it is, I know it is
Everything will be alright
Everybody wants to find Graffiti Bridge

[Verse 1: Mavis Staples]
Don't pick my apples, don't pick my peaches
(we are the new power generation)
Leave my tree alone...leave it alone...leave it alone
(we are the new power generation)
Don't you look at me
(we are the new power generation)
If you're sad and you know it and you think you want to blow it
Let your feelings out, love is there

[Bridge]
Just go!

[T.C. Ellis]
Kid! Yo Kid!
I got to do this, I got the noise, I got to do this

[Prince]
So pump the big noise, come on in the house

[Verse 2: T.C. Ellis]
This here rap's about the true confession
If you listen close you about to learn a lesson
You must know failure before success
Now this is the failure I must confess (well)
I was hanging onto life trying deal with this
Playing the games, almost got dismissed
Cocaine was the thing that I took on
And nowhere was the place that I was going (preacher, cmon on)
I must tell the truth, I cannot lie
I was headed for the kill, steal, destroy, and die
Top to the bottom to bottom to top
Success is where I'm headed there is no doubt
Success is something that we all want
But the truth is what we need to reach our point
I had to give this message the so-called truth
I hope it's something in it that's there for you
(Love to the left of me, love to the right
Come on make a noise somebody
Party tonight 

[oh yeah!]
Love to the left of me, love to the right
Come on make a noise somebody
Party tonight 

[oh yeah!])

[Verse 3: T.C. Ellis]
Like I told ya before, I'm a tell you again
Success is something that's deep within
So remember the truth you can't go wrong
The flesh is weak and the spirit is strong
I know it to do this rap, and I know its right
Because I did it in the name of Jesus Christ
(come on somebody lets party tonight)
Party tonight! (oh yeah!)

[Outro: Robin Power]
You want me to what?? (shake!)
What? (shake! shake!)
Awww, right

The New Power Generation has just taken control

[Refrain]
Dig you better dead, I'd dig you better dead
(I'd dig you)
Dig you better dead, I'd dig you better dead
Dig you better dead, I'd dig you better dead
(I'd dig you)
Dig you better dead, I'd dig you better dead

[Verse 1]
A long time ago, you took six months a walking
Talking on the other side
What started as an experiment turned into a heaven-sent
Message that saved your ass from dying

[Chorus]
Somebody said "In life there's always peaks and valleys"
And if you're lost they won't show you the way
That same somebody said "I'd dig you better dead"
But I'd much rather see if your God is what you say, say, say

[Verse 2]
And with the awesome power they struck
First they offered up the buck
Right in the middle, right in the middle they stuck (right in the middle)
A toke or two, what the fuck? (what the fuck?)
One minute you're hot
Tell the truth and you're not
That's the noose that they hang on a goose like you

[Chorus]
Somebody said "In life there's always peaks and valleys"
And if you're lost they won't show you the way
That same somebody said "I'd dig you better dead"
But I'd much rather see if your God is what you say, say, say

[Refrain]
Dig you better dead, I'd dig you better dead
Dig you better dead, I'd dig you better dead
Dig you better dead, I'd dig you better dead
Dig you better dead, I'd dig you better dead

[Verse 3]
And whatever you do, don't make somebody happy
Don't dress too freaky and make their daughters stare
Then you'll find out how deep the valley truly be
If you plan on catching the bus, you better have plenty fare

[Chorus]
Somebody said "In life there's always peaks and valleys"
And if you're lost they won't show you the way
That same somebody said "I'd dig you better dead"
But I'd much rather see if your God is what you say, say, say

[Refrain]
Dig you better dead, I'd dig you better dead
Dig you better dead, I'd dig you better dead
Dig you better dead, I'd dig you better dead
Dig you better dead, I'd dig you better dead

[Chorus]
Somebody said "In life there's always peaks and valleys"
And if you're lost they won't show you the way
That same somebody said "I'd dig you better dead"
But I'd much rather see if your God is what you say, say, say

[Refrain]
Dig you better dead, I'd dig you better dead
Dig you better dead, I'd dig you better dead
Dig you better dead, I'd dig you better dead
Dig you better dead, I'd dig you better dead

[Verse 1]
As bombs explode around us and hate advances on the right
The only thing that matters, baby, is the love that we make Tonight
As little babies in make-up terrorize the western world
The only thing that matters, baby, is love between a boy and girl

[Chorus]
Oh, expert lover, my baby
You ever had a Crystal Ball?
Undercover, no maybe
All for fun and fun for all

[Verse 2]
I can't remember my baby's voice because she ain't talking no more
Only the sound of love and prayer echo from the yellow floor
Yellow floor
Huh, she's saying:
"Dear Jesus, save us from temptation
Dear Jesus, save us from hell
Save us from the madness that threatens us all
Can you hear us? It's hard to tell
In your name we pray"

[Chorus]
Oh, expert lover, my baby
You ever had a Crystal Ball?
Undercover, no maybe
All for fun and fun for all

As soldiers draw swords of sorrow
My baby draws pictures of sex (Yes, she does)
All over the walls in graphic detail: sex

[Verse 1]
What if half the things ever said
Turned out to be a lie
How will you know the Truth?
If you were given all the answers
And you stopped to wonder why
But how will you know the Truth?

[Chorus]
Everybody's got a right to love
Everybody's got a right to lie
But the choice you make it ain't no piece of cake
It ain't no motherfuckin' piece of pie

[Verse 2]
What if Time's only reason
Was to give us all something to fear?
And if so you all, the end of the journey's so clear
Questionnaire: What did you stand for?
Questionnaire: Who did you save?
When it gets right down to wait a minute
When it gets right down to the nitty of the gritty
When it gets right down to it you take more than you gave

[Chorus]
Everybody's got a right to love
Everybody's got a right to lie
But the choice you make it ain't no piece of cake
It ain't no motherfuckin' piece of pie

[Bridge]
Mmmm oh
Got to (Going to?) tell the truth you all
Got to tell the truth
Got to tell the truth you all
Got to tell the truth
Got to tell the truth you all
Got to tell the truth

[Outro]
If there was just one day
That everybody tell the truth
We'd all trade bank accounts and move to Neptune

[Verse 1]
Don't play me
I'm over 30 and I don't smoke weed
I put my ass away
And the music I play
Ain’t the type of stereo you're trying to feed
Don't play me

I'm in the news again
For paying dues my friend

I've been to the mountaintop and it ain’t what you say
Don't play me

My only competition is, well, me in the past
If time, time, time existed moving ever so fast
Don't play me

[Verse 4]
You couldn't play enough of me now
To make me feel like a star
Don't play me I already do in my car
Don't play me

[Verse 5]
Don't be mad at me
The curtain puller in the game
Maybe all—how you call us?—"niggas" ain't the same
It's all good when you know the only fame
Is the light that comes from God and the joy you get to say His name
Don't play me

[Verse 6]
Don't play me
I've seen the mountaintop and it ain't what you say
Don't play me
I already got laid

"The Original Gang of Four"
Mary, Claire, Denise, and Belle
Circle of amour

[Verse 2]
Tenth grade, Central in September
That was a year I remember
On this chilly cold afternoon
I overheard the gang in the locker room
Rendezvous, Mary's house
Dirty words and wine
Needless rot say they all spend the day
Just counting time, counting time
Halfway through her history class
Denise she kindly raised her hand and asked
If she could be excused
("Can I be excused?")
Then she ran from school (Ran from school) in a hurry
The other girls, ooh they knew
This is what friends are really for
Mary, Claire, Denise, and Belle
Circle of amour

[Verse 3]
Circle of amour
Imagination showed a window
(Imagination)
On a cold September day
(Ooh)
Leaves are brown
(Brown)
Passion sounds
(Ooh)
Memories seldom stray
Four hands in the place where the V connect
Gang of four, circle of sex
In the vicious race to maturity
They almost faint from ecstasy
Sweat upon the necks of dames
No loser in this circle game
Because the memories are worth so much more
(So much more)
Mary, Claire, Denise, and Belle
Circle of amour

[Outro]
(Ooh)
Mary, Claire, Denise, and Belle
Mary, Claire, Denise, and Belle
Circle of amour
Mary, Claire, Denise, and Belle
Mary, Claire, Denise, and Belle
Circle of amour
Circle of amour

[Verse 1]
Using a special code he accessed his mind
In search of the reason why
In passion and fashion, he began traveling time
Third eye, third eye, third eye

[Verse 2]
The serpent approves
Then appears between Adam's thighs
And he tries to release upon Eve the nectar
The injector tries
He tries, he tries, he tries

[Verse 3]
So abduction complete
All stand on their feet
Look at one another and cry
What have we done?
Could this be the fun
On the dotted line for which I did sign?

[Verse 4]
I resign from the notion
Because yours was the potion
That I'm supposed to die for
I resign

[Verse 5]
In self-pity so dark
This shitty and stark
Realization is all that will soothe
Ultimately the only one
That can save you is you
Your God is inside and for that God you will do
Whatever it takes
If nothing else is true
The only one that can save you is you, yeah

[Outro]
(Shoobedoop)

[Intro]
Well

[Verse 1]
Dionne
You should have held my hand
You should have let me be your man
Dionne
You should have closed your eyes
You should have held on with both hands to your prize

[Chorus]
Dionne
You should have let me down easy
If you had no plans to please me
Dionne

[Verse 2]
Dionne
I could have been the one
I could have shown you the Champs-Élysées under the sun
Dionne, Dionne
I could have whispered your name
I could have whispered your name if only for fun

[Chorus]
Dionne
You should have let me down easy
If you had no plans to please me
Dionne

[Verse 3]
Dionne, Dionne
We could have shared a martini
We could have danced to Mancini, 'til dawn
Dionne
I should have broke down and kissed you
I should have...
I just miss you
Dionne

[Intro]
Oh, she said

[?]
(Hut!)

[Verse 1]
She said - "Man in a uniform
Tonight that's what I want you to be"
She said - "Third time this week you wore that old suit
But I don't give a damn, you see?
Because man in a uniform do funny things to me"
And I said - "It's third time, but I don't mind
Because that sister just so damn fine, ah"

[Chorus]
Man in a uniform (Hut!)
That's what I am
Man in a uniform, uh
That's what I am

[Verse 2]
She said - "Man in a uniform
Suffering every stroke of my hand
From the dusk until the early morning
You will grant this girl's demands" (Why?)
Because she need to be drunk with pride
Wait a minute, I'm going to tell you why
To make up, to make up
To make up for the emptiness that she feel inside
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on

[Chorus]
Man in a uniform (Hut!)
That's what I am
Man in a uniform, uh
That's what I am

[Verse 3]
Man in a uniform
She said - "tonight (tonight)
I want your attention" (attention)
She said - "tonight I want your violent tongue
To swallow my stench and be loyal to me
She'll never be free
Until you do me like a man in a uniform" (Hut!)

[Chorus]
Man in a uniform (Hut!)
That's what I am
Man in a uniform, uh
That's what I am

[Refrain]
This is what it's like in the Dream Factory, oh!

[Verse 1]
Hollyrock ain't all it seems (Lordy)
Don't get to serious, it's just a dream
Don't forget your friends, they're all you have got (Lordy)
Listen to the story of a man I am not
Party all night, hanging out
In the streets more than I be at home
I take a pill to wipe away my doubts
But a pill can't cure my being alone
Vodka and seven straight to my brain
Put me under false impressions, hide all my pain
Somebody help me, I'm losing control

[Refrain]
This is what it's like in the Dream Factory, oh!

[Verse 2]
Everybody got the big dreams (Hey Lordy)
But nobody got the bucks
Love and trust will help you make it in a world (Everybody)
Where there ain't no love, ain't no love
Dig
A man came up to me, smile in his eyes
He told me I was a saint
So I'm quitting my friends much to their surprise
I can't live up to the picture that they paint
Ah somebody help me, I'm losing control (Ow!)

[Refrain]
Guess I'm just a sucker in the dream factory, oh!

[Bridge]
La, la, la, la, la (Sucker)
Got to drive
(It's just a dream)
Look out
Do you want to party?
Do want a pill?
How about a false impression?
(Thrills, spills, chills)

[Refrain]
This is what it's like in the Dream Factory, oh!

[Verse 3]
Ow! Yeah
Up a little bit
(Dream factory, oh)
Party all night, hang up on the side, I said "Uh"
(Do you wanna party?)
I can't make up my mind
(How about a false impression?)
I can't seem to live with no pictures (Thrills, spills, chills)
Somebody got to help me! (Just a sucker)
I'm losing control (Just a sucker)
Guess I'm just a sucker in the dream factory, oh!

[Outro]
Guess I'm just a sucker in the dream factory, oh!
(Just a sucker, motherfucker!)

[Verse 1]
I saw a friend of mine today
In an ad saying what would do my body good
I told him he was wasting time I say
If God wanted milk in me
The breast I suck would have a line around the hood

[Pre-Chorus]
No member of the animal kingdom nurses past maturity
No member of the animal kingdom ever did a thing to me
It's why I don't eat red meat or white fish
Don't give me no blue cheese
We're all members of the animal kingdom
Leave your brothers and sisters in the sea

[Chorus]
Animal, animal kingdom
Animal, animal kingdom

[Verse 2]
Who told us we should eat the swine?
You can bet your final money it damn sure wasn't no friend of mine
What about the clams on the shore?
Souls in progress, here come the fisherman - soul no more

[Pre-Chorus]
No member of the animal kingdom nurses past maturity
No member of the animal kingdom ever did a thing to me
It's why I don't eat no red meat or white fish
Don't give me no blue cheese
We're all members of the animal kingdom
Leave your brothers and sisters in the sea

[Chorus]
Animal, animal kingdom
Animal, animal kingdom
Animal, animal kingdom
Animal, animal kingdom
Animal, animal kingdom
Animal, animal kingdom

[Chorus 1]
Cool as the other side of the pillow
Smooth as another glass of wine, oh yes sir
I'm so glad you're my baby, oh yeah
I'm so glad that you're mine

[Chorus 2]
Bad as Bonnie when she ran with Barrow, yeah
When you kiss me, feels like I'm committing a crime, oh yeah
You use furniture in new ways, yes you do
I can't find the adjectives enough to say
I'm so glad you are my baby
Okay, yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus 1]
Cool as the other side of the pillow, oh baby
So smooth there's another glass of wine
Bubbly, bubbly
I'm so glad you are mine, you are my baby
Oh yes I am
Oh yes I am
Oh yes I am
I'm so glad  you are mine

[Outro]
Cool as the other side of the pillow
Smooth, I want to drink you all out
How did you learn that trick with the chair?
I don't care
Just as long as you do it again
Cool as the other side, cool as the other side, cool as the other
Cool as the other, cools as the other side
As the other side of the pillow, baby
Cool
Cool
Glass of wine
I'll get tipsy and I ... 

[whistling]
Cool as the other side of the pillow
Cool

[Intro]
Hey!
"Down on it" 

[repeats in background]

[Spoken Intro]
Say baby, what you waiting on?
For you, uh, ain't no other fish in the sea
What you waiting on?
Acknowledge me

[Chorus]
Acknowledge me, don't dog me anymore
I was here in the beginning and I'll be here forever more
Acknowledge me, I only want to be your friend
I can make you happy baby, over and over again

[Verse 1]
Saw you at the party, you were looking so fly
Everybody wanted your number, you wanted mine
You came right up to me in one wink of an eye
You told me that you think of me both day and night and that is why
I've got to know how can you give your body to another
When your mind is here with me?
You need a friend much more than a lover
That's all I ever said I wanted to be

[Chorus]
Acknowledge me, don't dog me anymore
I was here in the beginning and I'll be here forever more
Acknowledge me, I only want to be your friend
I can make you happy baby, over and over again

[Verse 2]
I'm waiting for the phone call, but it just don't ring
I'm looking for a letter or a sign from heaven or anything
Everyday that goes by is another day I want you more
I'd give a million dollars to see you baby standing at my door
I'll lay you down and tell you stories
About the way that we could be
And when you are ready to feel the glory (Feel the glory)
I will only want to love you when it's something that you need

[Chorus]
Acknowledge me, don't dog me anymore
I was here in the beginning and I'll be here forever more
Acknowledge me, I only want to be your friend
I can make you happy baby, over and over again

[Verse 3]
Not that you care for a silly rhyme fronting an old cliché (Yeah) (Yeah)
But look at me baby, what can I say?
There ain't another fish in the sea (Yeah)
I could be singing a song any style, any way
Ain't nothing but a trick to me (Blow)
But I'm going to blow this horn until you are on your knees
Begging me please, please, please
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme love I can count on
Gimme, gimme body I can't go without
Uh, slaves for one another (Hey!)
Yeah baby, that's what I do believe I am talking about
So let me know how you want to go? (Yeah)
You want to get with that or this? (Yeah)
Uh, acknowledge me, baby
You got to or you can...kiss
How can you give your body to another? (How can you, baby?)
When your mind is here with me (It's here with me)
You need a friend much more than a lover (you need a friend)
That's all I ever said I wanted to be
(That's all I ever, ever want to be baby)
(Acknowledge me, me, me, oh yeah!)
Acknowledge, acknowledge, acknowledge, acknowledge me

[Chorus]
Acknowledge me, don't dog me anymore
I was here in the beginning and I'll be here forever more
Acknowledge me, I only want to be your friend
I can make you happy baby, over and over again
Acknowledge me, don't dog me anymore
I was here in the beginning and I'll be here forever more
Acknowledge me, I only want to be your friend
I can make you happy baby, over and over again

[Verse 4]
Come on pretty baby, sit your butt on the chair there
And let me run agenda in and out of your hair fair
Agenda for the morning, noon and night, so prepare there
You could come alone or tell a friend, I don't care bear
This a funky party so you need to be open
Giving up all I need so I don't need to be hoping
And even if we're dealing with that time of the month
It's fourth and goal and I ain't about to punt
Cuz as soon as you be strolling in your Lagerfeld blazer
You need to know how many ways a brother can praise you
Too bad for hell, too good to let heaven raise you
And if you want to see my dream, I need you for days and days
Baby doll, can you get the hell away
From that thing you call a man and then we can play
The kind of music that'll make your big butt sway
To the back, to the forth
When it's all said a better brother should be more
Thank the Lord
Huh, for a body like that, titties swinging like a door
Gimme to times just to thank my Savior
Girl, what can I say, you got the crazy flavor
I'm giving you plenty propers so you got to score
The only one that's going to make you holler for more
Like a whore, I'm yours
Acknowledge me, baby, what are you waiting for?

[Outro]
"Down on it" 

[repeats in background]
Welcome, this is where I live 

[fades out]
This is where I dream my dreams
Tonight we'll make love until the world stops turning
You are small but very strong, you move like a cat

[Chorus]
Fascination
I want you
Fascination
I want you, I do

[Verse 1]
Fascination chamber lands on the round that kills
The art you hoped to mirror like
Leaves blood upon the sill
The dream you keep dreaming, is better than the life you lead
The papers run out a day and Thirteen hours, Before the weed, it's so high

[Chorus]
Fascination
Still I want you
Fascination
Still I want you, I do

[Verse 2]
The head you thought was rolling, is now reason to be bored
The rapper that gave that head will thank his manager before the lord
And the headache that you moan about feels much better than the treatment would
The pills going to leave a side effect
That'll take another pill to correct
And the whole thing is leaving you feeling less than good
And you still high

[Chorus]
Fascination
Still I want you
Fascination
Still I want you, I do

[Bridge]
Do you mind if I just watch you shake it
Shake it
Shake it
Shake it
Shake it
...Nation
I want you
Fascination
I want you, I do

[Verse 3]
The most vital thing you thought
Is the epitome of doom
You can wake-up in cold sweat
Because one of them is in you're room
Singing on the tele
Making more bucks than sense
So called king gives birth to so called ... prince
A breakup's bitter taste
Still here when the love is gone
And the breaks you wish for
Finally comes among in song
Working it out
Work, work, work, working it out
Fascination

[Verse 1]
Ripopgodazippa, ripopgodazippa
If you flick of the pink plush, then this brother trippa
Start down at the bass then stop at the treble
Circle the midrange and up go me levels
"Precious" by Chanté is rocking the box
This cannot be foreplay cuz this be to hot
Up go the left thigh on me shoulder there
Up go the right and me blood pressure there
With my tongue in the cheek of the gold underwear
One yank of the teeth and they off on the chair

[Chorus]
Ripopgodazippa, ripopgodazippa
If you flick of the pink plush, then this brother trippa
My girlie, how in the world did you learn this that you know?
Ripopgodazippa, etc. etc. so

[Verse 2]
This bench that I normally use for the weights
My girl, she lay me down and try my soul to take
And devilish this night she was before as I'm laying there
She take it all the way down her throat, right down to the hair
She wouldn't move a muscle for what seemed like days
My heart stop beating and I died this way

[Chorus]
Ripopgodazippa, ripopgodazippa
If you flick of the pink plush, then this brother trippa
My girlie, how in the world did you learn this that you know?
Ripopgodazippa, etc. etc. so
Ripopgodazippa

[Verse 3]
I lay me girl down on the fake lamb fur
It's fake but it's still soft as what's between her
Lavender oil come from the bottle like I do
Whenever I think about me zippa ripping so good
All down the body and devil between the thighs
Ripop go zippa and you get a big surprise

[Chorus]
Ripopgodazippa, ripopgodazippa
If you flick of the pink plush, then this brother trippa
My girlie, how in the world did you learn this that you know?
Ripopgodazippa, etc. etc. so
Ripopgodazippa

[Verse 4]
Instead of walking inside, I just knock on the door
I take a look around until she begging me "More, more, more!"
When I finally come inside, I'm standing perfectly still
"I can't take no more!" Pump you then I will
"I just want to call your name, but I don't know what to say"

[Bridge]
Ripopgodazippa
If you're always with me
You'll never have to call me
Touche, touche
Hey

[Chorus]
Ripopgodazippa, ripopgodazippa
If you flick of the pink plush, then this brother trippa
My girlie, how in the world did you learn this that you know?
Ripopgodazippa, etc. etc. so

[Verse 1]
Walking up the stairs
Chelsea afternoon
Sweet wind blew
And not a moment too soon, hoo
I cried when I realized
That sweet wind was you

[Verse 2]
Spirits come and spirits go
Some stick around for the aftershow
I don't have to say I miss you
(Don't have to say I miss you)
'Cause I think you already know, oh

[Verse 3]
If you ever lose someone dear to you
Never say the words
"They're gone"
And they'll come back, yeah
They'll come back, yeah
They'll come back
Tears go here
Tears go here
Tears go here

[Verse 1]
When the things you know are right
Are far from what they seem
When the past becomes the future
And time becomes a dream
When the light of God is the only thing in life that will redeem

[Refrain]
Welcome, welcome to the dawn
Welcome to the dawn

[Verse 2]
When the voices you hear commands you
To entertain thee absurd
And when you do the action unlocks
The apocalypse of that you've heard of
When the day lies before you
Seems the darkness in a word

[Refrain]
Welcome, welcome to the dawn
Welcome to the dawn

[Verse 3]
Every piece a puzzle and every name a clue
Every charge you make is karma
So be careful what you do

[Refrain]
Welcome, welcome to the dawn
Welcome to the dawn
Thank you

[Intro]
(Ah yeah, ah yeah) 

[repeat sample in song]
Hide the bone
(Oh yeah) 

[repeat sample in song]

[Verse 1]
I can't hold it any longer
It's getting harder every day
The need for you is getting stronger
Than my need to play

[Chorus]
Playing hard to get is getting hard to play
How can I be cool falling every day?
Playing hard to get is getting hard to play
How can I resist? Love has got me saying, baby
"Give it up - bang, bang - before it be gone!"
Hide the bone

[Verse 2]
Oh, when you whisper that you want me
Press your body close to mine
I feel the fire burning and I just wanna surrender
I wanna surrender every time, hey!

[Chorus]
Playing hard to get is getting hard to play
How can I be cool falling every day?
Playing hard to get is getting hard to play
How can I resist? Love has got me saying, baby
"Give it up - bang, bang - before it be gone!"
Hide the bone

[Interlude]
Hide the bone
Hey baby
(Bone)

[Verse 3]
You are going to ruin my reputation
I'm used to making all the rules
But I can't control this situation (I can't control it)
When it comes to me and you
You are breaking down my resistance
I won't ever be the same, oh no (Oh no)
You kiss away all my defenses
This time the hunter is captured by the game (Bone)

[Chorus]
Playing hard to get is getting hard to play
How can I be cool falling every day?
Playing hard to get is getting hard to play
How can I resist? Love has got me saying, baby
"Give it up - bang, bang - before it be gone!"
Hide the bone

[Interlude]
Ah yeah, hey
(Bone)
Whatever you do - keep it moving
Whatever you do - don't stop

[Outro]
Don't stop the groove
(Let's hide the bone)
Bone (Let's hide the bone)
What you stopping for, nigga?
I didn't tell you to stop
(Let's hide the bone)

[Intro]
Well, well, well
Maybe I'll meet you tomorrow
Oooh
(The most beautiful girl in the world)
On the deep blue sea

[Verse 1]
Perhaps you noticed that I never look you in the eye
I'm just afraid that I might die of my love for you
I want to kiss you, but baby, I dare not try
Or my dreams most surely will come true
So that's why

[Chorus 1]
Please don't hold my hand because I will
Damn sure understand and kill
The other boys in the band who want you tomorrow, tomorrow

[Interlude]
They can't tap it - not tomorrow
(The most beautiful girl in the world)
You are mine tomorrow

[Verse 2]
On a deep blue sea I want to be swept away
With you I could pass the time of every night and every day
(All time)
Never remembering the songs to sing
Let alone what notes to play
I'm going to die of my love for you, baby

[Chorus 2]
Stay with me tonight, my dear
But please don't hold me tight because I fear
My heart just might feel joy instead of sorrow tomorrow

[Interlude]
I don't want to be happy - not tomorrow (not tomorrow)
(The most beautiful girl in the world)
I would rather cry tomorrow

[Bridge]
Tomorrow is the day I say after today
That you and I can play like we want
With under garments thrown, the seed can be sown
Slippery in the sauna
(Oh)

[Verse 3]
If I could just look you in the eye
But baby, I dare not try
Because then my dreams will surely come true (All time)

[Chorus 1]
Please don't hold my hand because I will
Damn sure understand and kill
The other boys in the band who want you tomorrow, tomorrow

[Outro]
Tomorrow
(The most beautiful girl in the world)

Get free, yeah

[Refrain: Kirk John & Morris Hayes]
NPG get rowdy, get rowdy now
NPG get rowdy, get rowdy now

[Verse 1: Prince]
Once again I don't follow trends, they just follow me
Just like the Israelites through the Red Sea
It might take you some time but you will want to see
The undisputed truth and get free

[Refrain: Kirk John & Morris Hayes]
NPG get rowdy, get rowdy now
NPG get rowdy, get rowdy now

[Sample: Chuck D]
Once again, back is the incredible

[Verse 2: Prince]
At the very core of thinking I originate
That's why you'll never know my thinking or my fate
Invisible, unless of course you are my mate
If not, you think you see me, I disintegrate
Disintegrate my thoughts from yours
You can feel me coming out of everyone of your pores
Reintegrating where I am understood and adored
You're just to my subject , that's why you're out of touch
So what's this claim, out of what?
My dear, I am the touch

[Ad lib: Chuck D.]
Ooh, hear me, feel me
Ooh, hear me, feel me

[Refrain: Kirk John & Morris Hayes]
NPG (get funky)
NPG get rowdy, get rowdy now

[Verse 3: Prince]
I can give you power (power) I can take it away
I can make you dance, 'cause this guitar I play
Heavy rotation
Never made my world go 'round
Commercialization, commercialization of the music
Is what brought it down

[Verse 4: Prince]
My level is now what you must learn to rise above
Talk to D'Angelo or better yet ?uestlove
It might take y'all some time but you will learn to see
The undisputed truth and get free (Get free)

[Refrain: Kirk John & Morris Hayes]
NPG get rowdy, get rowdy now
NPG get rowdy, get rowdy now

Funky
NPG, New power generation
Free nation, free nation, check it

Come on, come all to the download ball, off
There's no curfew to hurt you, no substitutions
School's now in session
Put down the Smith & Wessons
Real renegades don't invite grenades to make the grade
This is a brain raid
Who rise above the lies, raise above these days
New ways disguised as a craze
Uh, gotcha back against the status they throwin' up at us
Back against the wall again
High trees catch a lot of wind, oh
Last band standing
Gotta knock my over standing according to planning
And look up in the sky
No cable wire
Whoa, God bless the child
God bless the child
So funky
Bass

[Intro]
The greatest romance that's ever been sold

[Verse 1]
So what do you know, you and me
Finally face to face
Checking each other up and down
In all of the obvious places
Was there ever a reason for us to be apart?
The air that fills up this room says not hardly

[Pre-Chorus]
So this is where you end
And you and I begin
(This is where you and I, you and I begin)

[Chorus]
The greatest romance that's ever been sold
The greatest romance that's ever been sold

[Verse 2]
Baby baby, now your mind is open
To poetry seldom heard
Your heart has never been broken
Until you have heard these words
Your body was designed to respond to mine
In spite of your desire to mold me

[Pre-Chorus]
And in the middle of it all
We kiss and like rain (like rain) we fall into

[Chorus]
The greatest romance that's ever been sold
Baby, baby baby
The greatest romance that's ever been sold

[Bridge]
Oh, I know you can feel me, I know that you can dance
But what do you know about the greatest romance?
Not what you think, but what you believe
What was the real reason that Adam never left Eve?
And if the truth sounds like a memory
Then you know it was meant to be (meant to be), meant to be
Leave your inhibitions behind, come on, come on and see

[Pre-Chorus]
So this is where you end (this is where you end)
And you and I begin (you)

[Chorus]
The greatest romance that's ever been sold
The greatest romance that's ever been sold

[Breakdown]
I know you can feel me, I know you can dance
But what do you know about the greatest romance?
(The greatest romance that's ever been sold)
Not what you think, but what you believe
Can you tell me the reason, the reason that Adam never left Eve
(The greatest romance that's ever been sold)
The greatest, listen to me, uh
You brought me the grapes from the vine, oh yes you did
(The greatest romance) Can I talk to you
(That's ever been sold) Listen

You help me to remember the secrets of time
And you, you, you, you offer me your love
Your love, your love, so divine
And in return, girl, in return I will surrender
Oh yeah, I will surrender, oh, yes I will

[Outro]
The greatest romance that's ever been sold

[Intro]
Oh baby
Right back here in my arms
Right back here in my arms

[Verse 1]
Don't want you to write me no letters
Don't want you calling my phone
I just want you, I just want you
I just want you right back here in my arms

[Verse 2]
I ain't checking for the sweet talk, baby (Right)
Talkin' 'bout how you're missin' my charms (Right)
I just want you, I just want you
I just want you right back here in my arms
I just want you, I just want you
I just want you right back here in my arms

[Hook]
Right back here in my arms
(Oh baby)
Right back here in my arms
(Oh baby)

[Verse 3]
I know you got a lot on your mind (Right)
That's why I wanna give you some time (Right)
Till I get to, till I get to
Till I get to hug that body so fine
I know you need a little space, just a little
That's why I ain't showing my face (Right)
I just want you, I just want you
I just want you right back here in my arms

[Hook]
Oh baby
Right back here in my arms
Right back here in my arms
Right back right back
Right back here in my arms
Right back here in my arms

[Verse 4]
No, no, no to the postman bringing me letters
You know a brother gonna feel much better
If he keep his mind on, you know, whatever
Anything as long as it is making it wetter
Because I can't stop thinking about what we do
There ought to be a law against the hoochie ooh! (Ooh!)
(Can we groove?)
I don't want to do you no harm
I just want you right back here in my arms
Oh baby (Right back here in my arms)
Don't want you to write me no letters
I just want you, I just want you
I just want you right back here in my arms

[Hook]
Right back here in my arms
I just want you right back here in my arms
Right back here in my arms

[Outro]
I'll try to write you back
(Right back here in my arms)

[Intro]
Somebody's somebody
Somewhere, someone

[Verse 1]
It's 2 o'clock in the morning and I just can't sleep
Outside the rain is pouring, I'm lonely as can be
Maybe tonight'll be different than the nights before
I need to feel someone beside me, I can't be alone no more

[Chorus]
Tonight I want to  be somebody's somebody
Tonight I want to  belong to someone
(Someone)
Tonight I want to  be somebody's somebody
Tonight I want somebody that'll do it until the job gets done
(Oh yeah)

[Verse 2]
This big old world can be so empty living in it all alone
I realize, in its best disguise, a pretty house don't make a home
There's a hunger deep inside of me, how the fire burns
I want to  give good love to someone and get good love in return, oh

[Chorus]
Tonight I want to  be somebody's somebody
(Somebody's somebody)
Tonight I want to  belong to someone
(Someone)
Tonight I want to  be somebody's somebody
(I want to be somebody's somebody)
Tonight I want somebody that'll do it until the job gets done
(Oh yeah)

[Spoken Interlude]
Someone to hold me in that hour midnight
Someone to console me when things ain't goin' too right
Someone to bring me dinner sometime, yeah
(Mine, all mine)
Somebody to can call all mine

[Verse 3]
It's 2:05 in the morning and I got no one to call
I'm longin' to hear another voice inside these lonely walls
(Lonely walls)
Maybe tonight'll be different than the nights before (Maybe not)
I need to feel someone beside me
I cannot be alone no more (No more, no more!)

[Chorus]
Tonight I want to  be somebody's somebody
(Somebody's somebody)
Tonight I want to  belong to someone
(I don't want to be alone)
Tonight I want to  be somebody's somebody
(I don't want to wait another day, no)
Tonight I want somebody that'll do it until the job gets done
(I'll do it over and over and over and over, yeah)
Tonight I want to  be somebody's somebody
(Ooh, I don't want to wait, no!)
Tonight I want to  belong to someone
(Can I belong to you, baby? Oh yeah!)
Tonight I want to  be somebody's somebody
(Ooh, slow, deep and long)
Tonight I want somebody that'll do it until the job gets done
(Do me over and over and over and over)
Tonight I want to  be somebody's somebody

[Outro]
Oh yeah
If you're out there, come on, baby
I'll keep it hot for you
(Tonight I want to  be somebody's somebody)
Come on, baby
(Tonight I want somebody that'll do it until the job gets done, oh yeah)
Done
Somebody's somebody

[Intro: Prince]
Let's see, body oil:  check
Incense: check
Environmental records: double check!
I'ma get some serious drawers tonight, think I ain't?
Let's see, if I tell Gilbert and 'Rome to meet me eleven then I creep at ten that'll give me an hour of free reign
More drawers
(More drawers)

[Verse: Prince]
9:30: getting dressed
I had a couple sips of wine
Boo! I swear to God
My suit was hanging fine
Everybody at the club freaked
When I stepped from the limousine
They said: "Ooh, it's good to see you"
I said: "Oh, it's good to be seen
You know what I mean?"

[Spoken Interlude: Prince]
Tell you what's good
It's a good thing we live close 'cause I almost suffocated in that car
Next time I won't wear so much Paco Rabanne or whatever that stuff is
I wonder if they got potato chips up in this...
Man, this ain't like them house parties we used to go to
That's alright, I'm clean

[Chorus: Prince]
Tonight, hey, I'm a movie star
I see myself on a silver screen, huh
Tonight, it don't matter who you are
I'm the only star on the scene
You know what I mean?

[Spoken Interlude: Prince]
Man, I hate making movies
But I like that money, think I don't? Hmph
Check me out
I just walk in, don't even find a seat
Just threw my coat right on the floor
Grab somebody for a quick dance
Boy or girl, it don't matter no more, I'm hot!
Hahaha, shit
Mix was right
Bold, Lord
Ouch! Ha, ha
Baby, do you want to, do you want to get off?

[Chorus: Prince]
Tonight, I'm a movie star
I see myself up on the silver screen
Tonight, it don't matter
I'm the star on the scene
Ouch!

[Spoken Interlude: Prince]
Mix was right
On the one the kick drum hit the triple beat
Baby, I was popping
Did one spin, did a second, did the splits
Came up, looked around, the joint was hopping
Hopping! The joint was hopping!
Somebody say "Movie Star!"

[Skit: Prince and Susannah Melvoin]
So check it out, you wanna dance?
Are you wearing that Paco Rabbit or whatever you call it?
Oh wow, that's dog
What? Speak up, I can't hear over that suit
Maybe you can hear this?
Am I supposed to be impressed?
That's right, Rolls Royce
Check it out, baby
You want to dance now?
Maybe next song
Yeah right, dance floor is not big enough, fat cow

[Outro: Prince and Susannah Melvoin]
Ooh, the mix, it's about the mix
Ooh baby, I like that, but the kid going to show you a few tricks
Can I play with you?
Baby, let's creep, I had enough of this action
Bartender, on the house
Give everybody in here something
Man, I don't care
I got money to spare, you're cute and your music's thumping
Yo baby, get the check
"Yo baby" my behind, I need my money
Say Brother Carothers, can I get some credit?
No? Much money I done spent in this nasty joint?
You need to be slapped!
Darling, shall we leave now?
Go to Hades, boy!
So you like my crib?
It's not mine, it's rented
Say, how much did you have to drink?
What's the biggest lake you've ever been in?
So, do you like environmental records?
Crickets chirping, water rushing
Supposed to make you horny
It just make me want to go to the bathroom
Actually this one's not bad, check it out
So like, what's your name?
Zzzzzzz
Oh wow, that's dog!

[Verse]
Feeling mighty blue
By myself
One old lonesome shoe
By myself
Now that love's behind me
You'll find me
By myself
I just sit and stare
At the floor
Just don't seem to care
Anymore
Since my baby's gone
Got a padlock on my door
That old black cat
Keeps hanging around
But I am not blaming him
Because things are bad
It isn't his fault
I've gone and lost
The only love
I ever had

[Outro]
Love
Love
I miss him so
It's no lie
And I'm so "double o"
I could die
So I'll be
Just me here
By myself

[Intro: Prince]
Hot with you

[Chorus: Prince]
I wanna get hot with you
Get you underneath the cream and ooh
Get you doing things you thought you'd never do
Make you suck your tongue and say "ooh"
I wanna get hot with you
Take you upstairs to the fourteenth room
Multicolored lights and an ocean view
Ooh, I wanna get hot with you

[Refrain: Prince]
I wanna get hot with you

Like dance in front of my headlights
On a hot summer night, nude
I wanna get hot with you

[Chorus: Prince]
I wanna get hot with you
Get you underneath the cream and ooh
Get you doing things you thought you'd never do
Make you suck your tongue and say "ooh"

So I can prove that I'm the only one that brings out
The freak in you
I want to get hot with you

[Refrain: Eve]
I wanna get hot with you
I wanna get hot with you
I wanna get hot with you
I wanna get hot with you

[Verse 3: Eve]
Know the body banging, got you singing
Ignore the shouts from the neighbors, telephone ringing
Put me in positions thought I'd never do proper
Created a machine, now you know you can't stop her
Trying to turn me out, never happen, so start this
I'm supposed to tremble 'cause they call you 'The Artist'?
Let's wild out, can you handle ruff riding?
Treat you like a freak of the week and had you hiding from me
I do whatever you like, if you could take it
If I could be your girlfriend, you could catch me naked
Can't front sexually, I'd like a sample
But I don't think that I'm ready for you to make me an example
I mean , come on, why front on
I'd never place time, queen in your life
I'm there whenever
The things that you feeling for me, mutual
That I'm ready to call you daddy
Even get hot wit you

[Verse 4: Prince]
Meet me early morning in a fourth dimension plane
Astral traveling hottie, I know you know my game
Underneath the cream I'll meet you
And then we'll rearrange
Everything you know of love
I'll give you reason to change

[Refrain: Prince]
Hot with you
I wanna get hot with you
(I wanna, wanna)
I wanna get hot with you
(I want you)

[Verse 5: Prince]
I want to get hot with you
I wanna steal a kiss in the middle of an
Overcrowded room, yeah
That's what I wanna do, ay-yi-yi
I wanna get hot with you
Hot with you, ooh

[Chorus: Prince]
I wanna get hot with you
Get you underneath the cream and ooh
Get you doing things you thought you'd never do
Make you suck your tongue and say "ooh"
I wanna get hot with you
Take you upstairs to the fourteenth room
Multicolored lights and an ocean view
Ooh, I wanna get hot with you

[Verse 6: Prince]
Take a drive to the ocean
And drown you in a wave
(Hot with you)
Of a hundred thousand compliments, boo
I want you every day
(Hot with you)
And to be cool
And the only way to do that is every night
(Hot with you)
Get hot, get hot (Hot) with you (Hot)
Yeah baby

[Chorus]
I wanna get hot with you
Get you underneath the cream and ooh
Get you doing things you thought you'd never do (Never)

[Spoken Intro]
Listen to the drummer but you still wanna have fun, it shouldn't be work
Two, three, baby

[Verse 1]
I know life is much to drink, I was there
I know right now it's hard to think, I don't care
But it's time for you and me to wonder, why we are here
Maybe we should roll to the rock and rumble
Calhoun Square
Let's roll

[Chorus]
Meet me there
If you dare
Calhoun Square!

[Verse 2]
It don't matter clothes you are wearing or your hair
If you are freaky, they don't care and they don't stare
(Ain't nobody looking at you)
All that matters if you are happy
And if you are there
(Are you there?)
Don't you want to roll to the rock and rumble
Calhoun Square?
(Don't you want to? Come on now)

[Ad Lib]
Hey!

[Chorus]
Meet me there
If you dare
Calhoun Square!

[Verse 3]
Walk through veils of many colors if you dare
(Do you dare?)
Jasmine, peach and love for others in the air
(It's all in the air)
Don't be shocked to see your mother in the chair
(Sit down, baby)
Everybody roll to the rock and rumble
Calhoun Square
(Oh Lord)

[Ad Lib]
Hey, come on
Here me now
Calhoun Square, Calhoun Square

[Chorus]
Meet me there
If you dare
Calhoun Square!

No, no, leave the Chanel around your neck - please, baby, please
Now do something I've never seen before

Crawl over to me on your stomach - more, baby, more

[Outro: Prince]
Baby, baby
Baby, how you want to, how you want to be done?
Just say the word and we can start from number one
And go the distance, baby, till you tell me to stop

Picked up my paper today
Give you one guess what they say
Now we got to learn how to play
Interactive

[Verse 2: Prince]
Another cross in need of a road
Another loop in need of a hole
Another body in need of a soul
Interactive
Ain't that a bitch?

[Chorus: Prince and Mayte]
Tell me what to do and I'll do it
I don't care just as long as we get to it
Up and down, around and all through it
Baby, baby, baby, let's do it

Interactive

[Breakdown: Prince]
(As long as we get to it, to it, to it)
Yeah, yeah
I work twice as hard (Interactive, interactive)
To follow you no matter how far
To you I'm probably worth no more than the strings on this guitar
Ain't that a bitch?

[Outro: Prince]
Ow!
Interactive
Oh, oh
One more, one more

[Verse 1]
Say I don't mind
What you do to me
If you waste my time
Then it's meant to be
I called your number (Yes I did)
Like you told me to

[Chorus]
Like a puppet on a string
I'm going to dance and I'm going to sing
I will do most anything
If you promise me da bang, bang, bang!

[Verse 2]
Don't want to lie
I just want to do it
But some other guy (Baby)
Has beat me to it
If you are in love (Well)
We're two of a kind (Yes we are)
What good is your body, baby
Without your mind (Not much)

[Chorus]
Like a puppet on a string
I'm going to dance and I'm going to sing
I will do most anything
If you promise me da bang, bang, bang!

[Ad Lib]
Hit me, niggas!

Without the cool
When you try to fake it (Baby)
And you wanna get through (you know what I'm talking about)

I will do most anything
If you promise me da bang, bang, bang!

[Outro]
Bang, bang, bang!

[Verse 1]
Take my name, I don't need it
Nothing stays the same anyway
Take my fame, I can't use it
My girlfriend calls me lame, the game was over yesterday

[Chorus]
Tell me, what's my name?
Tell me, what's my name?
What's my name?

[Verse 2]
Take this bass, I can't play it
It only makes me wish for the way it used to be
You could slap my face, but I got to say it
You never would have drank my coffee if I had never served you cream

[Chorus]
Now tell me, what's your name?
Tell me, what's your name?
What's your name?
What's your name?
Come on!

[Verse 3]
Do you dream in color or do you discriminate?
Do you love others, do you love or do you hate?
Do you worship fire or do you worship a dove?
Do you live a liar or do you live for love?

[Outro]
What's your name?
What's my name?
What's your name?

[Verse 1]
Some days I feel tangerine
Some days I feel blue
Some days I just wanna black out
Everything I felt for you

Even though I take your picture
Everywhere I go
I use it for a coaster
And drink the overflow

[Verse 2]
Some days I make a lot of money
And give it all away
To take my mind off the tangerine color
Of your négligée

Beggars can't be choosy
And they don't know how to serve
You got a different phone number
And a lot of nerve

[Outro]
Some days I feel tangerine
Some days I miss you too

[Verse 1: Prince & Gwen Stefani]
So far, so pleased
I like the way you touch me
I like the way you tease
No car, no keys
I had to get us stranded
If you know what I mean

Big scar on my knee
Begging for a kiss is such a dull routine
Still I'm so far, so far
So far, so pleased

[Verse 2: Prince & Gwen Stefani]
So far, so fine
I find another beauty mark with every glass of red wine
So fast the time
Every time I have to go, I go and lose my mind
It's hard, okay
That's what happens
When a boy and girl don't get to play
So far, so far, so far, so pleased

[Guitar Solo]

[Ad libs: Prince]
Yeah
Come on, come on

[Verse 3: Prince & Gwen Stefani]
So far, so pleased
I like the way you touch me
I like the way you tease
No car, no keys
I could spend the night and leave at 10:15
So far, so far, so far, so pleased
Ooh yeah
So far, so pleased
Ooh-hoo

[Verse 1]
Baby, you got to be from a different world
Because  just one look from you could make an army surrender
Baby, you have got to rescue me
Girl, girl
A prisoner in love with the opposite gender

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain't saying you're better, baby
But I ain't saying you are not
I ain't saying anything until you stop
Never forget that
Because baby, I will be your jack
Of all trades
A mind and body well made

[Chorus]
Crucial: baby, our love has got to be
Crucial: everything from A to Z
Crucial: you've got to show me everything, everything, everything

[Verse 2]
Is that Old Man River knocking at your door
Saying that we got to let more than our feelings show?
Baby, tonight don't hold nothing back, I know you've got some more
I will give you mine if you give me yours

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain't saying you're better, baby
But I ain't saying you are not
I ain't saying anything until you stop
Never forget that
Baby, don't hold me back because baby, I baby I need a jack for all trades
A mind and body well made

[Chorus]
Crucial: our love has got to be
Crucial: every little thing from A to Z
Crucial: you have got to show me everything, everything, everything

[Verse 1]
I want to be an honest man
I will be your slave, just understand
How much I need you
And if I died
We will be together side by side

[Verse 2]
With you I know I can stand, stand
With you I can be an honest man

[Intro]
Ah-ooh, ah-ah-ooh, ah-ah-ooh, ah-ah-oh-ooh
Ah-ooh, ah-ah-ooh, ah-ah-ooh, ah-ah-oh-ooh

[Verse 1]
It's late and I'm running out of clever things to say
The kind that will bring a girl like you to tears
There's only one more glass of this rosé
Let's throw it on the fire with our past
And dance the night away until

[Chorus]
The sun, the moon and stars
Don't seem as far as they did yesterday
The sun, the moon and stars
In love we are forever, always

[Verse 2]
It's late and I think it's about time for you and me to get closer
To get closer than we ever did before (ooh)
Whenever there's a tide you can let it ride inside your interior
Lay back, relax upon my shore, oh
Ooh baby, I want to make love to you right here
One inside the other one, no fear, we're here until

[Chorus]
The sun, the moon and stars
Don't seem as far as they did yesterday
The sun, the moon and stars
In love we are forever, always

[Bridge]
Blow out this candle sunlight
And come lay down next to me
And paint another rainbow ooh-wee
Eclipse this light with ecstasy

[Verse 3]
Come on, come on
Let's lay down, I'm walking out of what to say
That kind of lucky rhyme make a chippy want to say
"Whisper in the belly" to me rocking rosé
Do you like I do, come on and dance the night away

Let's lay before they get to close the door
You and me, we got to get out on the floor
Come on, let the tide ride in and off the shore
I want to love you once again and then some more

Lay your head back I got my hand behind your head
Like you do the limbo supple on the bouncy bed
Let's bouncing on the summer spring and when you start to fall
You come like a cold winter due in Montréal

[Chorus]
The sun, the moon and stars
Don't seem as far as they did yesterday
The sun, the moon and stars
In love we are forever, always

The sun, the moon and stars
Don't seem as far as they did yesterday
The sun, the moon and stars
In love we are forever, always

The sun, the moon and stars
Don't seem as far as they did yesterday
The sun, the moon and stars
In love we are forever, always

[Verse 1]
Baby, you take a walk
Take a walk and leave me behind
Baby, you are going to walk, yeah
Gonna walk right out of your mind
We were meant to be
Got no reason, reason to lie
Baby, you take a walk
Think I'm going to talk sexual suicide

[Verse 2]
Baby, if you only knew
All the love, want a love that's deep in my heart
Ooh baby, me and you
Wouldn't be nothing could tear us apart
Honey, uh, every night
Cool surrender, lost in my arms
You, you feel so right
Doing it in the cuff, sound your alarm
Baby, come take a walk
People gonna talk sexual suicide

[Bridge]
No body like my body, baby
Ain't no ride like my ride
Super skinny-minded baby if you try to leave me:
Sexual suicide

[Verse 3]
Sugar, ain't it a shame
That you won't play the game
You got too much pride
You, you make your bed
But you gotta sleep with the sexual, sexual suicide
Suicide, sexual, sexual suicide

[Outro]
(Sexual, uh-huh, sexual suicide)
(Sexual, uh-huh, sexual suicide)
Girl
(Sexual, uh-huh, sexual suicide)
(Sexual, uh-huh, sexual suicide)
If you take a walk
(Sexual, uh-huh, sexual suicide)
People gonna talk
(Sexual, uh-huh, sexual suicide)
Somebody flip me over
Any liars in the house?
No?
Hey!
Eric

[Intro]
Every day's a winding road, is a winding road, is a winding road, oh
(Winding road, baby)

[Verse 1]
I hitched a ride with a crazy horse showgirl
She says she been down this road more than twice (Times)
She wanted to know if I could tell the future (Future, future)
I said, "I've never been there, but the brochure looks nice" (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Jump in, let's go (Let's go, baby)
Lay back, enjoy the show
Everybody gets high (High)
Everybody gets low (Low)
These are the days when anything goes

[Chorus]
Every day is a winding road
I get a little bit closer
Every day is a faded sign
I get a little bit closer to feeling fine

[Verse 2]
Listen now
She got a daughter she calls Easter (Alright)
She was born on a Tuesday night (She was)
I was just wondering people feel so all alone (All alone)
Feeling like a stranger in their own life

[Pre-Chorus]
Jump in, let's go (Let's go, babe)
Lay back, enjoy the show
Everybody gets high (High)
Everybody gets low (Low)
These are the days when anything goes

[Chorus]
Every day is a winding road
I get a little bit closer
Every day is a faded sign
I get a little bit closer to feeling fine

[Break]
(Life is a winding road)
Life is a winding road, is a winding road (Jump in)

[Verse 3]
I've been swimming in a sea of anarchy
I've been living on compliments and herbal tea
I've been wondering if all the things I'd ever seen
Were ever real (Ever real, ever real)
Were ever real, were ever really happening

Welcome to the Dawn
You have just accessed the Wild Experience

[Hook]
Hold, hold, hold onto your wigs!

[Verse 1]
Break down! Huh, this is a bust (Hold onto your wigs!)
All you sorry motherfuckers up against the wall
If you don't play, bite the dust
Cuz in a couple of simple fucking phrases
I'm going to hip you to the fucking plays of
The brand new mad style - you all say!
(These are the days of wild)
Hell yeah!

[Hook]
Hold, hold, hold onto your wigs!

[Verse 2]
Pop guns and weed? Brother please!
We're too wise for nonsense
The other 90's was better suited for that biz
Back when Dick was fucking Liz
Before soda pop had fizz
Don't blame it on your jockstrap full of jizz
Mentality so insane
I got a TEC-9, too, and it's called my brain
Shoot another brother? Not today
Death from envy is the only way
I can tear shit up you all, that's my style
These are the days of wild, put 'em up!

[Hook]
Hold, hold, hold onto your wigs!

[Verse 3]
Hooker, bitch and ho, I don't think so
I only knew one and never told her though
I thought about it many times (Diss me?)
That's the kind of shit to make you check your mind
Is your blood type the type that flows?
Is your blood type the type just stereo?
A woman every day should be thanked
Not disrespected, not raped or spanked
And if a woman ever said I did
She's a motherfucking liar and I'm a set-up kid
I'ma tear shit up you all, that's my style
These are the days of wild!

[Hook]
Hold, hold, hold onto your wigs!

[Verse 4]
Tennis shoes and caps, now that's phat
Up until the day another want to laugh behind your back
Saying we all look the same
God bless America, home of the brave
I'd rather dress to make a woman stare
I'm putting on something that another won't dare
It's a freezer burn compared to cool
If you still got loot, then who's the fool?
Everybody want to take the stand
Mind your own motherfucker, let a man be a man
I'ma tear shit up  you all, that's my style
These are the days of wild - put'em up!

[Hook]
Hold, hold, hold onto your wigs!

Welcome to the Dawn
You have just accessed

[Chorus]
Why you screaming?
You know I'm not a man of war
Break the gold chain that I gave you
Throw it down on the floor
Instead of this seven page letter
I wish I had peace of mind
My friends tell me, "You should go get her"
But loving you, loving you, loving you
Is a waste of time

[Ad lib]
Oh yes it is, a waste of time, ooh

[Verse 1]
I need to get out of this city
I need to get you out of my head
I need to get away from the words that you said to me
Oh baby
(Why you screaming? You know I'm not a man of war)
How could you think that I could put something
Inside of someone that I put inside you, inside you?
Even if I tried to, if I tried to
I couldn't 'cause I still smell like the last time that we...
I...
But lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you is a waste of time
(Waste of time) Oh yes it is
Lovin' you's a waste of time, baby, ooh

[Verse 2]
I need to feel wanted again
I need to feel love is alive, yeah
I need to hear you say that you ain't looking for another reason to make me cry
(Why you screaming? You know I'm not a man of war)
I've been trying to make you happy, baby, ever since we were sophomores
But lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you is a waste of time, oh yes it is
Oh, is a waste of time, waste of time, waste of time

[Verse 3]
And if there is no future then there is no past
And all we've got is right now
Oh girl, let's make it last, make it last, make it last, ooh

[Chorus]
Why you screaming?
You know I'm not a man of war
Break the gold chain that I gave you
Throw it down on the floor
Instead of this seven page letter
I wish I had peace of mind
My friends tell me, "You should go get her"
But loving you, loving you, loving you's a waste of time
(A waste of time) Waste of time

[Verse 4]
I need to get out of this city
I need to get you out of my head
I need to
I need to get away from the words that you said to me
I need to
I need to feel wanted again
Oh, I need to, huh, feel no sin, hear me

[Chorus]
Why you screaming?
You know I'm not a man of war
Break the gold chain that I gave you
Throw it down on the floor
Instead of this seven page letter
I wish I had peace of mind
My friends tell me, "You should go get her"
But loving you, loving you, loving you is a waste of time

[Outro]
You know I'm not a man of war

[Intro]
With the accurate understanding of God and His law
They went about the work of building
A new nation
The rainbow children

[Verse 1]
Wise one who understood the law
That was handed down from God long ago
Reflected the true meaning to his woman every day
And she surrendered her discerning of it into his care and keeping
For she trusted he would lead in the right way
Her children in subjection to her, she in subjection to the wise one
The wise one in subjection to the Almighty God
Forever is in subjection to God

[Chorus]
Just like the sun, the rainbow children rise
Flying upon the wings of the new translation
See them fly, fly, covenant will be kept this time
Just like the sun, the rainbow children rise

[Refrain]
Rainbow children it's time to rise
Rainbow children it's time to rise

[Verse 2]
As prophesied, the wise one and his woman
Were tempted by the resistor
He knowing full well the wise one's love for God
Assimilated the woman first and only
Quite naturally chaos ensued
And shield far verbally
Were banished
From the rainbow forever

[Chorus]
Just like the sun, the rainbow children rise
Flying upon the wings of the new translation
See them fly, fly, covenant will be kept this time
Just like the sun, the rainbow children rise

[Verse 3]
Who is your real father?
The everlasting one
The one who came from nothing
And nothing is what everything comes
The one who commands your armor
With the simple phrase 'I am'
Every time that she obeys
She gives birth to the Son of Man, who is this?
Reproduction of a new breed leaders, stand up - organize!
Reproduction of a new breed leaders, stand up - organize!
Understand others before denials
Do you dream it like
A person the people found so
Never changing one piece of it
To feel like one with the flow
The scales within become unbalanced
And thus began the fall
The sin of one within
The count of sin of one and all

[Refrain]
Rainbow children it's time to rise
Rainbow children it's time to rise

[Outro]
Wise one who understood the law
That was handed down from God long ago
Held fast in his belief
That the Lord would bring him another one
Who loved him so

[Intro]
Oh, baby
Oh, baby

[Verse 1]
How many times have you called my number
Wishing I was someone else?
How many times did my heart tumble
Feeling sorry for myself?
How many times have I kissed you
And smelled another man's perfume?
How many lonely nights I missed you
Wishing for ya body in my lonely room? (lonely room)

[Chorus]
Baby, if you break my heart one more time
It'll be the last heart you will ever break
I've taken all I can take
Baby, this heart wasn't made to break

[Verse 2]
How many times can you hurt me (hurt me)
Before your conscience makes you stop? (stop, stop, oh)
You made it all, why now desert me?
Baby, you know you can never cop (never cop), never cop
A body that'll do you like I do
You got to get your thing together sister
I'm tired of being your fool

[Chorus]
Baby, if you break my heart one more time
It'll be the last heart you will ever break
I've taken all I can take
Baby, this heart wasn't made to break

[Bridge]
Baby, don't you break my heart
No, no, don't do it!

[Chorus]
Baby, if you break my heart one more time
It'll be the last heart you will ever break
I've taken all I can take
Baby, this heart wasn't made to break

[Verse 3]
(When yo fix your mouth to tell that lie)
When you fix your mouth to tell a brand new lie
(Never before told, by and by)
Never ignore the truth, by and by
(False words should never be spoken)
False words should never be, never be spoken
(My heart should never be broken)
And baby, my heart should never be, never be broken

[Chorus]
Baby, if you break my heart one more time
It'll be the last heart you will ever break
I've taken all I can take
Baby, this heart wasn't made to break

This funky joint in the city
Baby knows
Where the freaks come out to play
Baby knows
Venezuelan, black and pretty
Baby knows
The kind that make you wanna pay, yeah

[Chorus: Sheryl Crow & Prince]
Baby knows
She got the long dark legs
Baby knows
She got the butt that go 'round
Baby knows
This kind of poochie make you beg
Baby knows
Turn a dog into a hound

[Verse 2: Sheryl Crow and Prince]
Baby knows
She tell me what I wanna hear
Baby knows
She stroke me up and never down
Baby knows
Whispering sexiness in my ear
Baby knows
I'm just a junkie for the sound
Baby knows
She make you call your boys
Baby knows
In a powwow to scope a plan
Baby knows
How to ditch her man in a trunk of a Lexus
A perplexing hex this witch has flexed

[Chorus: Sheryl Crow & Prince]
Baby knows
She got the long dark legs
Baby knows
She got the butt that go 'round
Baby knows
This kind of poochie make you beg
Baby knows
Turn a dog into a hound

[Interlude: Prince and Sheryl Crow]
Oh, baby, oh, baby

Baby knows
She knows how to make you feel
Baby knows
Like your stuff ain't brown tonight
Baby knows
And her perfume, it smells like the weekend

[Verse 3: Sheryl Crow and Prince]
Baby knows
This funky joint way down in the city
Baby knows
Where the girls sing along to the hip-hop all night long
Baby knows
White girls, black girls, Latinas, oh so pretty
Don't make me give you this ring, baby, oh oh oh

[Chorus: Sheryl Crow & Prince]
Baby knows
She got the long dark legs
Baby knows
She got the butt that go 'round
Baby knows
This kind of poochie make you beg
Baby knows

Baby knows
This kind of poochie make you beg

Turn a dog into a hound

[Outro: Prince]
Give me your number and I call you
I know you didn't just turn me down

[Verse 1]
I could tell from the moment you walked in the room
That it wasn't your dress you had on
That wasn't your perfume
And what happened to the ring that I gave you?
What am I to assume?

[Refrain]
I love you, but I just don't trust you anymore

[Verse 2]
You could tell from the moment you looked in my eyes
That I could see right through you
You must apologize
I've always given you the best in life
Even in the wrong, it was right
I know you trust me, but you don't love me anymore, no

[Verse 3]
I remember meeting you here in the good ol' days
I would never pick the flower of my favorite protégée
Maybe if I would have
Then you would not treat me this way
You tricked me, but you will not anymore, no no

[Refrain]
I love you, but I just don't trust you anymore

[Verse 1]
I never thought you would be the one
That I'd want to run to
I never thought you would be the one
That would make me care
And even though you done me wrong
For some strange reason I can't explain
I get happy knowing you phoned
Because your voice could kill my every pain

[Refrain]
Why do we play this silly game?

[Verse 2]
I never thought you would be the one
That I'd want to give to
A diamond ring, anything
That you ask me to
But there you were, bragging to your friends
Making up a story that's so lame
That I was down to be your sugar daddy
One way ticket to ghetto fame

[Refrain]
Why do we play this silly game?

[Verse 3]
Every other night you weren't at home
Out in the streets, just acting grown
Never with a bodyguard or chaperon
Then I hear a rumor that breaks my heart
Instead of taking care of yourself
You are tearing yourself apart
Now why you want to
(Why you want to, why you want to)
Now why you want to go and do that, love?

[Refrain]
Why do we play this silly game?

[Verse 4]
I never thought you would be the one
(That I'd want to run to) that I'd want to run to
I never thought you'd be the one
That would make me care
No matter how far I run
I'll never be the same (I'll never be the same)
In the end, in the end, there's only us to blame

[Refrain]
Why do we play this
Why do we play this silly
Why do we play this silly game?

Tell me why
Oh why
Why do we play this silly game?

[Intro]
What am I going to do?!

Wishing I was kin to your PoomPoom

Every day and night, girl (PoomPoom)

[Verse 3]
Hey little shorty, what your name is?
Catching all this wreck in the music biz
How'd you get that body my crew be macking?
How'd you get dem eyes? Dem all you lashes?
Honey, you number to on my chart
Before you get to one, you got to audition:
You got yo audition for the part (Boom)
Now what's your doctor's name? (PoomPoom)

[Chorus]
PoomPoom
I can't stop thinking about you (PoomPoom)
Every day and night, girl (PoomPoom)
PoomPoom
I can't stop thinking about you (PoomPoom)
(PoomPoom)

[Verse 4]
4:59, huh, could you be so kind
To tick a little faster so I could, so I could, so I could find
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock
A better way to spend this precious, this precious time
Than occupying my mind with the PoomPoom

[Chorus]
Thinking about your PoomPoom
Oh no, can't stop thinking about you (PoomPoom)
(Hold it right there, shorty)
Every day and night, girl (PoomPoom)
(Don't you move now - what your name is?)
What am I going to do? (PoomPoom)
(What your ame is?)
What am I going to do? (you looking good to me)

Ooh, ooh! (PoomPoom)

PoomPoom PoomPoom PoomPoom PoomPoom PoomPoom
PoomPoom Poom
PoomPoom PoomPoom PoomPoom PoomPoom PoomPoom
PoomPoom Poom

[Verse 1]
Okay, let me say this quick before I start to cry
You are the only one that I gave in to, the one I fantasize for
And time away from you has taught me
What I should have known
That this hole I'm trying to fill with another yeah, it's growin'
And I got your package
But when I tried to write back I bailed
See, trying to express the future, sometimes language fails
And over this time I've learned
My life force is increased by knowing you
Every door that closes, another one opens
Strange but true
Strange but true

[Verse 2]
No regrets because I forget the unfamiliar faces
Those petty lies and alibis, just gold diggers chasing
Dreams of sovereignty, they're tryin' to come between you and me
A curse therein set forces a chain of events
That only freed me when I remembered
Where I was and who I am
The only Prince that will ever rule this holy land
All understand and all stand under this affirmation now
By the power invested in me by God
All negativity bows
Strange but true
Let's see what you can do

[Verse 3]
You may have lost me, but I found myself
The ones who love me without condition, this is my wealth
And with these words I will win
Repeat them over and over again
All understand and all stand under this affirmation now
By the power invested in me by God
All negativity bows
All negativity bows
All negativity bows
Strange but true
Let's see what you can do
Strange but true
Let's see what you can do
All negativity bows

[Outro]
Strange but true
All negativity bows
Strange but true
Let's see what you can do
All negativity bows
All negativity bows
Strange but true
Strange but true
Strange but true
Strange but true

The sleazy one?
Yo, I know Big Juice is in there, girl

Oh, get it on
Girl, I think we better leave
Because if we don't, I think I might have to have another one
Then I might change my name
To... ?
What's my name? Margarita
Y'all help me find Juice, I'm trying, I can't find him
Are you still looking for him?
Yeah, he's just... you know
He's up in here somewhere, I can't find him though
(No no, definitely not seen him)
Girl, let's go, I smell like an ashtray
(It's time to go)
We ain't going nowhere
Sir, I'm sorry
This club has a very strict dress code
We do not accept bluejeans
What you mean?
It don't take Stevie Wonder to see I got on the right clothes in here
I need to get up in this club
Hell, I could buy every one of you
We're not for sale!

[Intro]
Ooh

[Verse 1]
Wherever you go, whatever you do
Oh please, remember that I'll always be there for you
You don't have to call, you don't have to say
Just think about me and I'll be on my way
I don't have to worry, I'm sure you'll be fine
'Cause if you stay happy, then what's yours is mine

[Chorus]
Wherever you go, whatever you do
Remember that I'll always be there for you
(Oh baby)

[Verse 2]
Wherever you are, think of your dreams
Ooh please, remember life ain't always what it seems
For each rainy day that comes your way
The sun will come shining and you'll be okay
Keep on smiling, every girl and boy
Remember when you were children, you had toys
Wherever you are, think of your dreams
Remember that dreams become the life you lead

[Verse 3]
Whatever you play, it's okay to lose
Ooh sometimes as long as you learn from every game you choose
If one thing is sure, you'll always endure
If you try your best at everything you do
Say what you mean and mean what you say
The price for a broken heart, it's too much to pay
And nothing is worth it, if you don't have to try
The higher the stakes, the higher the sky

[Chorus]
Wherever you go, whatever you do
Please remember that I'll always be there for you

[Verse 1]
And now I'd like to turn your heart to a tale of sheer delight
A song of adulation, love, and fear
No one loved him better, no one better sacrificed
She gave her angels that summer night

[Verse 2]
Fate as she designed it took her from her man
Destiny and love don't always go hand in hand
(Hand in hand)
As the world lay waiting like an embryo in a womb
She gave her angels that night in June
(She gave her angels)

[Verse 3]
She gave her angels to a man because her man had none
To watch over him 'til she returned
(Her man, her lover, her so)
Her father for all these things he meant to her, she felt it right
She gave her angels that summer night
She gave her angels that summer night

[Chorus]
If she could be the muse to the Pharaoh
Then one day she might be queen

[Verse 1]
If like Sheba, she then could bring presents and wine
The helix, he might get between them in other words, intertwine
With the ebony and milk of her thighs
If she could be muse and let him decide
Perhaps, she'll let him decide, she could be muse to the Pharaoh
There is nothing he wouldn't give her see
For the future of the nation rests in her belly
And if the Proverbs of the 31 and verse 10
Becomes the song she sings again and again
She might be queen

[Chorus]
If she could be the muse to the Pharaoh
Then one day she might be queen

[Verse 2]
Take a load off sweetie darling
Let me run agenda through your hair
There's so much information for the next generation
Who's going to drop it if you're not there?
And whether the enemy makes a run on the palace
Or whether the enemy does not?
The children will be laced with the protection
Of the word of God, the opposite of NATO is OTAN
And if the number 13 is such a bad luck number
When there's no such thing as luck
Then the berries, talons, arrows, and stars
Are all superstitions, what the
Get busy big baby, cause when the devil come
Dem devil come dressed as light
Maybe they gone fool the untrained mind
But nobody I know gone bite
Like a thief in the night my Lord come and strike
Leave nothing but ashes to the left, dust to the right
Holocaust aside, many lived and died
But when all truth is told, would you rather be dead or be sold?
Sold to the one who can now mate the displaced bloodline
With the white jail bait, thinking like the keys on
Prince's piano will be just fine
So, there it is for all to see
Now what's beyond you and me
Depends, my friends, primarily
On how you view your role in eternity

[Outro]
If she could be the muse to the Pharaoh
Then one day she might be queen

[Verse]
Love, like a rose in bloom
All of the rainbow children will feel it soon
To the east, word traveled about this energy
Until it reached the banished ones
Who just wanted this love to cease
They now fallen into
The resistor's dream
And they built a digital garden
Or so it seemed
In this brilliant darkness
So-called angels of light
Lies, lies, lies, lies, lies
And all the rainbow children will stand and fight
For everlasting, everlasting life
For the one who sits on the right
For the one who sits on the right
For the one who sits on the right
For him we're willing to do the work

[Spoken]
The banished ones approaching
The palace shouted obscenities
They tried to confuse the rainbow children
And dethrone their king
Using the lies promoted by the whose papers
Hella visions, and scagazines
The banished ones constructed a digital garden
Around the palace that extended throughout the world
Furthermore they demanded compensation for their time
Spent in the palace before the exile, this was noise
"So be it," said the wise one
And gladly obliged with an invisible deed
The banished ones accepted
And returned to their place of birth in mendacity
As for the rainbow children
They began deconstructing the digital garden
Door to door they went in search of those willing to do the work

[Intro]
It's courtin' time

But they come true when I'm near you
You're a genie in disguise
Full of wonder and surprise and

[Chorus]
Betcha by golly wow (Wow, wow)
You're the one that I've been waiting for forever
And ever will my love for you keep growing strong
Keep growing strong

[Verse 2]
If I could, I'd catch a falling star
To shine on you so I know where you are
Paint a rainbow in your favorite shade
To show I love you, thinking of you
Write your name across the sky
Anything you ask, I'll try because

Betcha by golly wow (Wow, wow)
You're the one that I've been waiting for forever

And ever will my love for you keep growing strong!

[Spoken Interlude]
Baby, sometimes
A man can't find words to express all the things he feels inside
But every just so often
The words of another who's truly in love seem to work out fine

To say I love you (I love you)
To say I'm thinking of you!

Betcha by golly wow (Wow, wow)
You're the one that I've been waiting for forever

In goes the truth and out goes the lie
And before the beach gets too sandy

Pussy pussy (Control man)
(Here come the drums)

[Intro]
Uh, yeah, uh
Good morning ladies and gentlemen
Boys and motherfucking girls
This is your captain with no name speaking
And I'm here to rock your world
With a tale that will soon be classic
About a woman you already know
No prostitute she, but the mayor of your brain
Pussy Control

[Chorus]
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
(Pussy, Pussy, Pussy, Pussy Control)
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
(Pussy, Pussy, Pussy, Pussy Control)

[Verse 1]
Our story begins in a schoolyard
A little girl skipping rope with her friends
A tisket, a tasket, no lunch in her basket
Just school books for the fight she would be in
One day over this hoodie
She got beat for some clothes and a rep
With her chin up, she scolded "All you all's molded
When I'm rich, on your neck I will step"
And step she did to the straight A's
Then college, a master degree
She hired the heifers that jumped her
And made everyone of them work for free?
No! Why?
So what if my sisters are trifling?
They just don't know
She said "Mama didn't tell'em what she told me
'Girl, you need Pussy Control'"

[Chorus]
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
(Pussy, Pussy, Pussy, Pussy Control)
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
(Pussy, Pussy, Pussy, Pussy Control)

[Verse 2]
Pussy got bank in her pockets
Before she got dick in her drawers
If brother didn't have good and plenty of his own
In love Pussy never did fall
And this fool named Trick want to stick her
Uh, talking more shit than a bit
About how he going to make Pussy a star
If she come and sing a lick on his hit
Pussy said "Nigga, you crazy if you don't know
Every woman in the world ain't a freak (Pussy)
You can go platinum for times
Still couldn't make what I make in a week (Pussy)
So push up on somebody that want hear that
Cuz this somebody here don't want to know (Pussy)
Boy, you better act like you understand
When you roll with Pussy Control"

[Chorus]
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
(Pussy, Pussy, Pussy, Pussy Control)
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
(Pussy, Pussy, Pussy, Pussy Control)

[Breakdwon]
Breakdown
(Pussy)

[Verse 3]
With one more verse to the story
I need another piece of your ear
I want to hip you all to the reason
I'm known as the Player of the Year
Cuz I met this girl named Pussy
At the club - International Balls (Pussy)
She was rolling for deep
Tree sisters and a weepy-eyed white girl driving a Hog
I pulled up right beside her
And my electric top went down (Pussy)
I said "Motherfucker, I know your reputation
And I'm astounded that you are here
I fear you are lonely and you want to know (Pussy)
A 12 o'clock straight up nigga
That don't give a shit that you are Pussy Control
Well I'm that nigga, at least I want to be
But it's going to be hard as hell (Pussy)
To keep my mind off a body
That would make every rich man want to sell, sell, sell
Can I tell you what I'm thinking that you already know?
You need a motherfucker that respects your name"
Now say it, Pussy Control

[Chorus]
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
(Pussy, Pussy, Pussy, Pussy Control)
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
(Pussy, Pussy, Pussy, Pussy Control)

[Spoken Interlude]
And the moral of this motherfucker is
Ladies, make them act like they know
You are, was, and always will be Pussy Control

[Chorus]
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
(Pussy, Pussy, Pussy, Pussy Control)
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
(Pussy, Pussy, Pussy, Pussy Control)

[Spoken Interlude]
Peace and be wild
Say what, huh?
Oh no, don't you think about calling her a ho
You juvenile delinquent
Best sit your ass down
Talking about Pussy Control
(Pussy, Pussy, Pussy, Pussy Control)
Huh, can you dig it?

[Chorus]
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
(Pussy, Pussy, Pussy, Pussy Control)
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
(Pussy, Pussy, Pussy, Pussy Control)

[Intro]
Never say die, never say why (Oh yeah)

[Chorus]
Make your mama happy
Make somebody proud
Never say die, never say why
Stand up, touch the clouds

[Verse 1]
Billy got a test in geometry
He didn't study night before
He wants a steady job and a salary
So I guess he got to study more
That's why we are saying

[Chorus]
Make your mama happy
Make somebody proud
Never say die, never say why
Stand up, touch the clouds

[Verse 2]
Annie went to college, got a Ph.D
Drive a BMW
All the things Annie ever wanted to be
She was when she finished school
That's why we are saying

[Chorus]
Make your mama happy
Make somebody proud
Never say die, never say why
Stand up, touch the clouds

[Interlude]
(Yeah, yeah)
(Somebody proud)

[Verse 3]
People of tomorrow want a better way
It gets harder and harder every day
Don't let them fool you, don't you let them say
You are any less than they are
Baby, you are here to stay!

[Outro]
Oh yeah
Happy
Make your mama happy

[Verse 1]
Last night when I left you fast a sleeping
I should have contemplated suicide
For the smile upon your face that's well worth keeping
By morning smears for every tear you cry
I could manage a week or two without those kisses
It'd be hard, but something tells me I could try

[Chorus]
For that matter, whatever to make you reconsider
Is there truth when you make love to a lie?
Excuse me, but is this really goodbye?

[Verse 2]
Why did I ever let you in this morning?
Why didI let you come inside my door?
I should have known without that smile adorning your face
A kiss was not what you came for
That's when your hand reached out to touch me gently
At least that's how it happened in my mind

[Chorus]
For that matter, whatever to make you reconsider
Is there truth when you make love to a lie?
Excuse me, but is this really goodbye?

[Bridge]
You can't begin to understand how I think about you
(Everything)
Everything I want to do, I cannot do without you
However wrong you want, I'll be
Just please don't leave
(Don't leave)
If it means this life without you, baby
I swear I'll spend it on my knees
Excuse me, but is this really goodbye?

[Verse 3]
Last night when I left you I was so sure
We'd be together forever and four days
And now my shade of blue couldn't get no bluer
I don't even know what I did to make you go away
I could possibly stage a front and play the cool one
(Cool one)
Heart in my hand trying to hold back every cry
But who would applaud me when it's you, my one and only
Who ever gave me a good reason not to die

[Chorus]
Excuse me, but is this really...
(Goodbye)
Excuse me, but is this really...
(Goodbye)
Excuse me, but is this really goodbye?

[Outro]
(Goodbye)
Goodbye, goodbye
(Goodbye)
Goodbye
(Goodbye)

[Verse]
In a pale blue spotlight
A figure spins around
A voice calls out to you
"Baby, do you like the sound?"
The undulating acrobat ready to do your bidding says
"Come, you must let me dress you
But first I must do a fitting
Do you like fast?
Do you like it slow?
I know it's better if we make it up as we go
And oh, by the way tell me now what's your name?"
I'll let it sweeten my tongue just once and never speak it again
Since this is our little secret
Just once and I'll never speak it again, this is our little secret

[Outro]
Untarnished memory in a pale blue spotlight
Let me hear you scream, if you are ready for
One nite alone with me

[Verse 1]
Every time I watch the other people news
I see a false picture of myself, another one of you
They try to tell us what we want, what to believe
Didn't that happen in the Garden
When somebody spoke to Eve?

[Chorus]
But I'm willing to do the Work
Willing to do what I got to do
I'm willing to do The Work
Tell me now what about you?

[Verse 2]
Look around and tell me your Sun is Risen
When your brothers and sisters are in the Fall
What is left give when your work is done?
What do we own besides the right to crawl?
See we're living in a system that the devil designed
And suffering from this devil's most heinous crime
He's tried to keep us from the reason we were born
That is to be the living truth in human form

[Chorus]
But I'm willing to do the Work
Willing to do what I got to do
I'm willing to do The Work
Tell me now what about you?

[Verse 3]
This work is not an easy task
But this is the work we must do for Revelation to come to pass
This work is the kind that turns your back on the Ruling Class
By putting them in their place just like the past
Taste it, ain't it sweet sweet?
Gotta lot of work to do
Nothing can stop us
We got to go through it to get to it
I heard somebody say

[Chorus]
But I'm willing to do the Work
Willing to do what I got to do
I'm willing to do The Work
Tell me now what about you?

[Outro]
Thank you

[Verse 1: Milenia]
There's a place I want to go
Where the milk and honey flow
Without God, it wasn't there
Now I feel it everywhere

[Refrain:  Prince & Milenia]
Feel it, feel it
Can't you feel it?

[Verse 2: Prince]
When I was lost and couldn't see my way
I used to follow what everybody say
Now I know that it's written in the heart
Now I'm ready, I'm ready to start

[Chorus: Prince & Milenia]
Without God, it wasn't there
Now I feel it everywhere

[Verse 2: Prince & Milenia]
We were always meant to be
In paradise eternally
Before the truth, I did not care
Now I feel it everywhere

[Refrain: Prince & Milenia]
Feel it
Feel it
Feel it everywhere
Feel it
Feel it

[Outro: Prince]
Can you feel it, feel it?
This mighty good feeling everywhere
We've got so much work to do everywhere

[Spoken]
To all his good brothers
The wise one spoke highly of his muse
Because her love for the one true God
Was growing with every passing day
So he said to all a good night
Sent them to bed early
And invited his muse to join him
In the sensual everafter

[Verse 1]
I know that I'm not going to sleep tonight
'Cause you are not by my side and that ain't right
I thought that we bought this bed for two
But what good is it if I'm not with you

[Chorus]
Give me a page on my two-way
I'll hit you back with no delay
When you hear all I've got to say
You are gonna see me
Whether in person or the phone
I've got to get you all alone
And when I do baby, oh it's on
You are gonna see me
You are gonna see me

[Verse 2]
There's never a minute that I find
That you don't ever cross my mind
If you could just hold me tight you'd see
There's nothing harder for you than me

[Chorus]
Give me a page on my two-way
I'll hit you back with no delay
When you hear all I've got to say
You are gonna see me
Whether in person or the phone
I've got to get you all alone
And when I do baby it's on
You are gonna see me
You are gonna see me

[Bridge]
Give me a page on my two-way
I'll hit you back with no delay

[Verse 3]
You are the reason I took a rope and lassoed the moon
To prove that when it comes to you
There's nothing I won't do
I'd stare into the sun if you would be mine
It's not so great a leap since to all others I am blind

[Outro]
I know that I'm not going to sleep tonight

[Verse 1]
Want to get lost in the mellow, mellow of my mind
Chop a tree, pay the cost
I rather have a glass of you that's fine
Come on over baby 'round 7, chill in your favorite chair
You can watch a tape of this mellow after party
Macy and Common were there
Besides, you know it takes awhile for me to do my hair

[Chorus]
Come on get lost in the mellow, mellow
Come on get lost in the mellow, mellow

[Interlude]
How's that feel?

[Verse 2]
Where you want to eat tonight baby?
I know this dope spot called one another
Or maybe we might swing by the egg
The perfect place to play house, I could smother you
I just might be running lines, there's just so much you can find
In the mellow of my mind

[Chorus]
Come on get lost in the mellow, mellow
Come on get lost in the mellow, mellow

[Bridge]
This rainbow psychedelia
Come on get lost in the mellow, mellow
There ain't nothing to be afraid of
Just you and me in the mellow of my mind

[Verse 3]
I want to get lost in the composition of you
Let the rhythm play only the notes you want me to
I'm a good learner and once I understand
I'll stand under you and let you show me
How you want your man to be
I could dance for you a little comical minuet
If you desire I'll shed my attire, anything to get you wet
Shower, my flower?
So much to do, so little time
So choose wisely and you can find thee
In the mellow of my mind

[Chorus]
Come on get lost in the mellow, mellow
Come on get lost in the mellow, mellow

[Verse 4]
Can I sing to you while you bring yourself to joy?
I'll go slow at first, while you quench your thirst
Wet circles round the toy
While you bring yourself to joy

[Verse 1]
Imagine a young woman running for her very life
Tr-tr-trying to get away from the one who loves her
This young woman: your wife
Into an alley cold and rainy
October just before dawn
Leaping atop a mountain of bricks
Her clothes now covered with sick
The danger hardly gone
She turns and curses the day she met you
And that she wishes she was never born

[Verse 2]
Say it's just a dream
You open up your eyes
And come to realize
You simply imagined this
So you lean over and give her a kiss

[Chorus]
Here on earth, here on earth
With you it's not so bad
Here on earth, here on earth
I don't feel so sad
Stay right here
Here on earth

[Verse 1]
If you ain't got no place to stay
Come on baby 'round this way
Stay with me baby
But let me tell you how it's going to be

[Chorus]
There's a theocratic order
There's a theocratic order now

[Verse 2]
This is how it's going to be
If you want to be with me
Ain't no room for disagree
1+1+1 is 3
Take your time and think it trough
If this is what you want to do
I ain't really that hard to please
'Cause 1+1+1 is 3
Stroke your hair a hundred times
Let me see what I can find

[Chorus]
There's a theocratic order
There's a theocratic order now

[Interlude]
The Banished Ones:
"We are the Banished Ones and we have come to dance
If you will not let us, we'll have to kick your pants!"

[Verse 3]
Who's that knocking on your door?
Didn't we throw you out before?
I'm about to get rowdy!
I'm about to get rowdy, now!
Make me want to do something
We could be surrounded in the palace
"Everybody wants to get you!"
I don't care
How many you all just came to dance?
Let me see you shake your pants
We don't give a duck what you got on
You just need too work that sexy body all nite long
Come on
Where them Banished Ones at?
"Said they around the back"
Don't cut them no slack
"I'm going to tap, tap, tap"
But should I keep this party going?
"Brother you know that!"
Moneyapolis, sing-Rainbow Children, raise your hands
If we can't do it, nobody can!

[Outro]
Here they come you all
Rally around the palace now
You know what we got to do!

How'd that fool get up in here?
Snagglevoice

[Verse 1]
I heard the news from a friend of mine and yours
She said the smell of missing me
Was coming from your pores!
She said I broke your heart so bad
I didn't deserve you back
But don't you have to have a heart first before you get it broken?
Don't you have to want to tell the truth before a word is spoken?

[Refrain]
So what about the heartbreak?
Everybody's had one see

[Verse 2]
The fault of mine goes from LA to the streets of NYC
But I ain't crying about payments overdue
I got some milk but no drop is spilled
Over things you put me through
Can't you see we are all just trying
Trying to get this hustle on
Looking for the righteous to buy in
'Til we right everyone of the wrongs

[Refrain]
So what about the heartbreak?
Everybody's had one see

[Outro]
Have a heart

[Verse 1]
That's my favorite time with you
Just after we make a movie
The kind that requires
The title "Parental Advisory"
Let's brush our teeth in the same sink
Don't worry girl it's cool
We can pose in the mirror
I'm digging you digging on me digging on you

[Verse 2]
We hooked up now, I can try her
I can put my load in the dryer
So much we can share
The same height, weight, and body fluid
We hooked up now, we can do it
Been waiting baby
Been waiting baby
It's so hard to bear
The objects in the mirror
The objects in the mirror are closer
Than they appear

[Verse 1]
He was not or never had been in favor
Of setting our people free
If it wasn't for the Thirteenth Amendment
We woulda been born in slavery
He was not or never had been in favor
Of letting us vote so you see
Abraham Lincoln was a racist who said
"You cannot escape from history"

[Chorus]
Like the snow coming down the mountain
That landed on Wounded Knee
Nobody wants to take the weight
The responsibility

[Verse 2]
Hear the joyous sound of freedom
The Harlem Renaissance
Hear Duke Ellington and his band
Kick another jungle jam
Ooh, do you wanna dance?
Who's that lurking in the shadows?
Mr. John Hammond with his pen in hand
Saying "Sign your kingdom over to me
And be known throughout the land!"
But, you ain't got no money, you ain't got no cash
So you sign your name and he claims innocence
Just like every snowflake in an avalanche

[Chorus]
Like the snow coming down the mountain
That landed on Wounded Knee
Nobody wants to take the weight
The responsibility

[Spoken: NPG Operator]
This experience will cover courtship, sex, commitment
Fetishes, loneliness, vindication, love and hate
Welcome.. welcom.. welco.. welc.. wel.. we.. w..
Welcome to The Dawn
You have just accessed the Gold Experience
Press Gold to begin

[Intro]
Da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da

[Verse 1]
If I leave my front door open
Would you come and visit me?
Just to slander my name hoping
That I would pack my bags and leave

[Verse 2]
If I did would you remember
To feed the dove and clean the cage?
And never count in front of the children
Lest they die of old age

[Chorus]
I don't really know why we have to go our separate ways
Separate ways
Whether or not we grow after the seeds are sown
Only time can say

[Verse 3]
Can I offer you baklava
Or a bagel with cream cheese?
Will we say grace to our father
Holding hands down on our knees?

[Verse 4]
Are we better off just fighting?
You on your side, me on mine
Are the words that I keep writing
Only pearls before the swine?

[Chorus]
What makes men claim that you're a friend
When you are not at all?
They just want
They knock you down and then
They lift you up again, just to see you fall


But like a bird I'll keep on singing
A song that never leaves your mind
If nothing else you've taught me one thing
"Never cast your pearls before the swine"

[Refrain]
So young and beautiful
So young and beautiful

[Verse 1]
You're so young and beautiful
You're so full of life everybody knows
That's you they try to take advantage of you
But you don't have to do what the others do

[Verse 2]
You're so cool the world at your feet
They only want your virginity
Keep your clothes on and your chastity
Until you find the one that's worth it baby

[Refrain]
So young and beautiful
So young and beautiful

[Verse 3]
You're so fine my heart's just pounding
If I had the chance to lay you down
I'd probably take a rain check 'til next summer
Because I don't want to be like all your other lovers

[Refrain]
Young and beautiful
Young and beautiful

[Verse 4]
So young and beautiful
I'm hipping you to the game darling
So that you will always remain
Young and beautiful
Young and beautiful
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Let me go, boys, let me go
Push my boat from the highest cliff to the sea below
Rocks are waiting, boys, if rocks await
Swoop down from the sky and catch me like a bird of prey

[Chorus]
Now my feet won't touch the ground
Now my head won't stop
You wait a lifetime to be found
Now my feet won't touch the ground

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Singing, now my feet won't touch the ground
Now my head won't stop
You wait a lifetime to be found
Now my feet won't touch the ground
Now my feet won't touch the ground

[Chorus]
I've got the world on a string
Sitting on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world, what a life, I'm in love

[Verse 1]
I've got a song that I sing
I can make the rain go
Anytime I move my finger
Lucky me, can't you see, I'm in love

[Pre-Chorus]
Life is a beautiful thing
As long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly so-and-so
If I should ever let it go

[Chorus]
I've got the world on a string
Sitting on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world, what a life, I'm in love

[Pre-Chorus]
Life is a beautiful thing
As long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly so-and-so
If I should ever let it go

[Chorus]
I got the world on a string
Sitting on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world
And this is the life
Hey now
I'm so in love

[Martin Luther King, Jr.]
I come to this magnificent house of worship tonight
Because my conscience leaves me no other choice
A true revolution of values will lay hand on the world order
And say of war;
"This way of settling differences is not just
This business of burning human beings with napalm
Of filling our nation's homes with orphans and widows
Of injecting poisonous drugs of hate
Into the veins of peoples normally humane
Of sending men home from dark and bloody battlefields
Physically handicapped and psychologically deranged
Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love"

Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love"
Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love"
Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love"
Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love"

[Chorus]
I'm swimming in the smoke
Of bridges I have burned
So, don't apologize
I'm losing what I don't deserve
The blame is mine, alone
For bridges I have burned
So, don't apologize
I'm losing what I don't deserve
What I don't deserve

[Verse 1]
When you feel you're alone, cut off from this cruel world
Your instincts telling you to run
Listen to your heart, those angel voices
They'll sing to you, they'll be your guide back home

[Chorus]
When life leaves us blind
Love keeps us kind
It keeps us kind

[Verse 2]
When you've suffered enough and your spirit is breaking
You're growing desperate from the fight
Remember you're loved and you always will be
This melody will bring you right back home

[Chorus]
When life leaves us blind
Love keeps us kind
When life leaves us blind
Love keeps us kind

[Verse 1]
Don't look now but there's another rocky road
Another heavy "Why?" of the much too heavy, heavy load
But today I'm going to face it, yeah, 'cause I'm sick of dealing any other way
Nobody said the race was fair but I'm going to keep running just the same

[Chorus]
Today, today is the first day of the rest of my life

[Verse 2]
Don't look now but here comes another heartbreak
Benefit of the doubt I'll give it, control of my life I've got to take
'Cause I'm alive and that's reason enough for me to bust a smile
I have arrived and now I want to stay for a little while

[Chorus]
Today, today is the first day of the rest of my life
Let's go

[Chorus]
Today, today is the first day of the rest of my life
Today, today is the first day of the rest of my life

[Verse 1]
Without a word of warning
The blues walked in this morning
And circled around my lonely room
I didn't know why I had that sad and lonely feeling
Until my baby called and said we were through, ooh

[Chorus]
For yesterday this time I sang a love song
But today I'm singing the blues

[Verse 2]
Now, it strikes me kind of funny how love can be this way
We were lovers last night, honey
But I'm alone again today
And it strikes me kind of funny how fate can be unfair
I come right on the losing end in every, every love affair
Yes, it must be, it must be meant for me that I should be the one
Be the one to always lose

[Chorus]
For yesterday, yesterday this time I sang a love song
Oh, oh, but right now I'm singing the blues, oh yeah

[Intro]
Mmm-mmm
Ooh wee
Fellas would you look at that thing
Have you ever?

[Verse 1]
You just got back from Paris
You probably went to buy some clothes
You are on your way to Nell's in New York
Gonna meet who? Heaven knows

[Pre-Chorus]
But it ain't about where you're coming
Ain't about where you go
Ain't about who you've been with
'Cause it isn't about who you know

[Chorus]
It's about that walk
Can we talk about it?
It's about that walk
I want to shout about it, ooh wee

[Verse 2]
Ass like a fine cut diamond
Mounted on two legs of stone
The prison I could do some time in
If I ever got that ass alone

[Pre-Chorus]
But for now I'll just keep my shirt on
'Cause I ain't about losing cool
Said, it ain't about losing sleep, for that matter
Baby, that nothing that I do

[Chorus]
It's about that walk
I wanna talk about it
It's about that walk
I want to shout about it, ooh wee

[Bridge]
Oh yeah baby
(Anything else let me do that work, shake it) (Ooh)
Mmm, mmm-mmm
Fellas have you ever

[Pre-Chorus]
But it ain't about where you're coming
Ain't about where you go
Ain't about who you been with
Don't care about who you know

[Chorus]
It's about that walk, yeah
I want to talk about it
Baby, baby, baby about the walk
Ooh shout about it, shout about it, ooh wee

[Outro]
Oh Lord, Lord
Girl, you know you got the walk
Girl, you know I got the talk
Run
Lord have mercy
Eyh
Keep playing
Ugh
Vegas on the sea
Ooh-(what what)
Remember about that ending?
On the one
Ugh

[Verse 1]
Spoke to me
I can't believe it, but she spoke to me
Close to me
I never thought I'd get her close to me

Now the moon and the sun belong to me
All my wildest hopes, my crazy dreams
But they seem more like reality

[Verse 2]
Fantasy
This girl fulfills my every fantasy
She must be
Specially designed by heaven just for me (just for me)

My friends look at her, they see mystery
But I look at her and I see a masterpiece
Can it be, I mean really did she?

[Chorus]
Spoke to me
I can't believe it, but she spoke to me

[Verse 2]
Spoke to me
I can't believe it, but she spoke to me
And if she hurts me
I'll take it all with open arms you see (you think I won't?)

'Cause like the track under a subway train
She could roll all over me and I'd still be the same

[Chorus]
'Cause today is the day she spoke to me
I can't believe it, but she spoke to me
Close to me
I never thought I'd get her close to me, whoa

[Outro]
If I'm stuck in some groovy wet dream
Don't pinch me
I don't want to wake up
I'm digging the scene (I'm digging, digging)
Yeah, baby

[Chorus]
It took five women to get you off of my mind
It took five months, a plenty good wasted time
But it just took five minutes when I saw your face again
To fall in love all over, I guess with you I'll never win

[Verse 1]
March was a cold one in more ways than one
Went down to the nightclub looking for the sun
Looking for a light that could brighten up a day
That's been darker than a hole since you went away

[Verse 2]
April usually brings showers
This time it was a hurting kind
This woman said she wanted my baby
I told her I'd have to be deaf, dumb, and blind
To fall in love with someone that I barely knew
The baby would never really have a father
'Cause I still, 'cause I still, 'cause I still, still, still, huh
Be stuck on you

[Bridge]
It took five women to get you off of my mind
Get off my mind, baby
Falling in love all over, you I'll never win

[Verse 3]
May was her name, she was a-jumping
Jumping from plane to plane
Actress or model or something
Can't even remember her first name

[Verse 4]
June brought an Easter bunny
Needless to say, hmph, that girl was late
Told a made-up story to a busy-body
Of our only date, what a sketch

[Verse 5]
July was a heartbreak, extraordinary
Said I met this woman whose kiss was something scary
It felt so much, so much like yours
But it only made me, made me want you more
She's gone, she's gone but you're still here
I want you very, huh, it's you I fear

[Chorus]
Said it took five women, yes it did, to get you off my mind
It took five months, five months, a plenty good wasted time
But it just took five minutes and I saw your face again
I fell in love all over with you, I guess I'll never win
(I'll never win)

[Verse 1]
Another Friday night
Another tired line
Baby, you sure look good
Hey baby, what's your sign?

How many ask for your number
Before they even know your name?
How many out there tired of playing
This silly old time game?

[Chorus]
Hey, and when the lights go down
And it's just you two
That's when you and your lover, yeah
Do what they're supposed to

That's when you feel the heat
Hotter than July
That's when you and your baby, baby, baby
When your baby get it right
That's when your baby get it right

[Verse 2]
How can you tell him no
When he loves you so?
He'll buy you anything
Anything you want

His eyes all aglow
He'll know you're good to go
Dinner, dinner, dinner in the finest restaurant, yeah
Girl, you'd better know
Reel him in until he do it a couple times in a row
It's just the same, it's just a game
Go back to do whatever, he'll sleep outside your door

[Chorus]
When the lights go down, yeah
And it's just you two
That's when you hear the sounds
Of what true lovers do, yeah

And when you feel the heat, oh
Hotter than July
That's when you and your baby
When your baby get it right
When your baby get it right

[Outro]
That's when your baby get it right
That's when your baby plays with it right
Baby, get it right

[Verse 1]
What's a single woman with no real man to do?
Trying to raise your kid when he couldn't give a damn about you
All my cares and troubles dive right off my window sill
Every time I pop my little pill

[Verse 2]
A pixie does my laundry and the universe my will
All my cares and troubles dive right off my window sill
All my cares and troubles dive right off my window sill
Every time I pop my little pill

[Verse]
Is it me or did the room just get darker?
Is it me or did I just lay down and die?
Is this a dream or did the world just crumble at my very feet?
How in heaven will I ever be all right?

[Chorus]
There is lonely
And there is lonely
And then there's how I feel right now
Perhaps only Cain when he'd slain his brother
Could ever come close to knowing how

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
There is lonely
And there is lonely
And then there is how I feel right now
Perhaps only Cain when he'd slain his brother
Could ever come close to knowing how
There is lonely
And there is lonely
And then there is how I feel right now

[Verse 1: Promise]
I Promise, I try College
Did it but I quit it they couldn't define knowledge
For me, I got it, So I’m honest
He living, Spitting Wisdom with some of the top artists
Who are not flawless, but my part is
Yet they don't see what I'm doing is not (?)
They like, Promise, why bother
Well living in the sewer, it’s filled up with hot garbage

[Hook: Promise]
As long as I got a pen and a microphone
And sweet beats to recite my songs you know
You got me
You got me
You got me
Give me a stage to recite my poems
Lights low when the mic is on
You got me
You got me
You got me

[Verse 2: Drake]
If this don't sell, Imma make it sell
And criticism's invited, I take it well
My savings account got a vacant smell
And priorities shift when you take a L
Every time I feel like leaving
Somebody'll play Comeback Season
And that'll give me enough of a reason
To stand outside trying to jingle my keys and
I guess I'm attached to her
Can't fathom going back to a bachelor
When you've been in a Range since you started high school
It’s hard going back to the Acura
Yeah, yeah
So Imma stick around as the rain trickle down and the cars get sold
These rappers is all thickle but a ways it could sound
Full of loud and go and put her face to the town

[Hook: Promise & Drake]
As long as I got a pen and a microphone
And sweet beats to recite my songs you know
You got me
You got me
You got me
Give me a stage to recite my poems
Lights low when the mic is on
You got me
You got me
You got me

[Verse 3: Sacario]
You got me
And you got me
And you got me
When I said I’m not a rapper it's not cause I am
It’s cause my momma said I'm not like them
I don't look like them
I don't act like them
Only way you know I rap is if you see me rappin’
And I am the truth I can't lie
Hand on the bible in the booth with punch lines
And New York City dumb high
Too much champagne
Threw it up like gang signs
You wanna know if you got me?
Then watch me
But watch me through a train, I
Cause I am Sacario
The same guy
Who flow like
Flow like agua
We don't like no fake, nada
Rappin' ass actor,you need an Oscar
And the world know who I are
Why you think Promise featured a pop star?
Sacario

[Hook: Promise]
As long as I got a pen and a microphone
And sweet beats to recite my songs you know
You got me
You got me
You got me
Give me a stage to recite my poems
Lights low when the mic is on
You got me
You got me
You got me

[Verse 1]
The sun set in my heart this evening
Because an old friend of mine got lost in the jive
Little did she know, when you're stuck in the snow
Nobody gets out alive

[Verse 2]
Tears fall gently in my garden
As I wait in vain for my sweet baby to call
I guess what my own brother told me was true
He had been with my sweet baby and she never really loved me at all

[Verse 3]
Night fell so dark this evening
The moon wasn't shining nowhere
Sometimes that old light in the alley would light up this old heart of mine
But now I'm wondering if there's someone up there who really cares

[Verse 4]
The night fell darkest in Persia
What used to flow blue is now flowing black
Many a doctor can try, but only heaven knows why
When it comes to love
Why do some men, why do some men turn their backs?
Can't somebody please tell me?

[Verse 5]
Maybe the morning air will make me feel better
Oh, I hope better than I feel right now
Last night a stranger took my picture and then he, uh
He asked if I'd buy it, huh
I said I guess I don't know how

[Chorus]
Old, old friends for sale
Get 'em while the gettin' is hot
But you better watch out, they'll kiss you
Until they get what you got
And they'll show you the friends that they're not
Old friends for sale

[Intro]
Hey!

[Verse 1]
What a night, what a city
Girl, you show is looking pretty
Tryin' to catch a cool one
Checking for a little fun

[Chorus]
Sarah
Oh Sarah, honey, is that you?
Is that you, baby?

[Verse 2]
Got your good shoes on
Ribbon in your hair
That skirt ain't talking too long
Can see your underwear

[Chorus]
Sarah
Oh Sarah, honey, is that you?
I bet it's you, baby

[Interlude]
Hey!

[Verse 3]
Girl, I hate to be the one
To tell you that your day is done
Best to get your shit and go on
Or Tina won't be alone

I'd never raise my hand to you
No telling what my foot'll do (watch out)
Ah, I'm kidding baby, that's a joke
Maybe I just got my heart broke
There's only one thing left to do

[Chorus]
Sarah
Oh Sarah, honey, is that you?
Is that you?

[Outro]
Yeah!
Oh!
Yeah! Ow! Ow!
Is that you, baby, is that you?
I think it's you
Good, one more take

[Verse 1]
Extraordinary
The love you make to me it's some kind of scary
I would be a fool to leave you
For I was born to love you
This is true

[Verse 2]
Extraordinary
The way you make me feel
I'm so very glad it's real
And not a dream
Even though it seems I'm dreaming

[Bridge]
People try to break us up
There were times a little rough
But we survived 'cause we had a love

[Verse 3]
Extraordinary
I'd give the world to you
Each and every thing you do is so very nice
You make my clock tick twelve twice
Then disappear time and everything else
When you are near
Extraordinary, oh

[Verse]
Rock-a-bye your baby with a Dixie melody
When you croon, croon a tune from the heart of Dixie
And just place my cradle, mammy mine
Right on the Mason-Dixon line
And swing it from Virginia
To Tennessee with all the love that's in you
Weep no more, my lady
Sing that song for me
Little joy, just as though
You had me on your knee
A million baby kisses I'm gonna deliver
The minute that you sing that Swanee River
Rock-a-bye your rock-a-bye baby with a Dixie melody

[Bridge]
Oh, people want my fair lady
Why don't you sing the song for me?
And little joy just as though
You're happy right now
A million baby kisses I said, said I'm gonna deliver
The minute that you sing that Swanee River
Rock-a-bye your rock-a-bye baby with a Dixie melody
One more time, yeah

[Outro]
A million baby kisses I'm gonna deliver
The minute that you sing that Swanee River
Rock-a-bye your rock-a-bye baby with a Dixie melody, oh

Hey mommy

[Verse 1]
Through the gates
Knock on the door
Put your clothes in a pile on the floor
Take your pick from the Japanese robes and sandals
Drink champagne from a glass with chocolate handles

3121
You can come if you want to

Butterflies scared that they're going to be awake all night long
Dancing in your belly like a ballerina
In spite of your efforts to calm them down

[Chorus]
Oh, don't you want to come?
3121
It's gonna be so much fun
3121
That's where the party be

Un instant, je vous connecte

[Spoken Intro: Mayte]
Nuestra presentacion especial comenzara en breve
Pero antes un mensaje de nuestros auspiciadores

[Intro: Prince]
Uh, yeah
Uh
Good morning ladies and gentlemen
"What hotel number is she in?"
Boys and motherfucking girls
"319, 319"
"Cool"
This is your captain with no name speaking
And I'm here to rock your world
With a tale that will soon be classic
About a woman you already know
No prostitute she, but the mayor of your brain
Pussy Control
Are you ready?

[Chorus: Prince]
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh

[Verse 1: Prince]
Our story begins in a schoolyard
A little girl skipping rope with her friends
A tisket, a tasket, no lunch in her basket
Just school books for the fight she would be in
One day over this hoodie
She got beat for some clothes and her rep
With her chin up, she scolded "All y'all's molded
When I'm rich, on your neck I will step"
And step she did to the straight A's
Then college, the master degree
She hired the heifers that jumped her
And made everyone of them work for free?
No! Why?
So what if my sisters are trifling?
They just don't know
She said "Mama didn't tell'em what she told me
'Girl, you need Pussy Control'"
Are you ready?

[Chorus: Prince]
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh

[Verse 2: Prince]
Pussy got bank in her pockets
Before she got dick in her drawers
If brother didn't have good and plenty of his own
In love Pussy never did fall
And this fool named Trick want to stick her
Uh, talking more shit than a bit
'Bout how he going to make Pussy a star
If she come and sing a lick on his hit
Pussy said "Nigga, you crazy if you don't know
Every woman in the world ain't a freak
You can go platinum four times
Still couldn't make what I make in a week
So push up on somebody want to hear that
Cuz this somebody here don't want to know
Boy, you better act like you understand
When you roll with Pussy Control"
Are you ready?

[Chorus: Prince]
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh

[Verse 3: Prince]
With one more verse to the story
I need another piece of your ear
I want to hip you all to the reason
I'm known as the player of the year
'Cause I met this girl named Pussy
At the Club International Balls
She was rolling four-deep
Three sisters and a weepy-eyed white girl driving her haul
I pulled up right beside her
And my electric top went down
I said Motherfucker, I know your reputation
And I'm astounded that you're here
I fear you're lonely and you want to know
A 12 o'clock straight up nigga
That don't give a shit that you're Pussy Control
Well I'm that nigga, at least I want to be
But it's going to be hard as hell
To keep my mind off a body
That would make every rich man
Want to sell, sell, sell
75, we need another.. 85, 85 here, sold!
Can I tell you what I'm thinking that you already know?
You need a motherfucker that respects your name"
Now say it, Pussy Control
Are you ready?

[Chorus: Prince]
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh
Aaah, Pussy Control, oh

[Spoken Interlude: Prince]
And the moral of this motherfucker is
Ladies, make'em act like they know
You are, was, and always will be Pussy Control
Are you ready?
Peace and be wild
Aaah, Pussy Control
Say what, huh?
Oh
Oh no, don't you think about calling her a ho
Are you ready?
You juvenile delinquent
Best sit your ass down
Talking about Pussy Control
Huh, can you dig it?

[Outro: Prince]
Aaah, Pussy Control
Are you ready?
Oh
Are you ready?
Aaah, Pussy Control
Are you ready?
Oh
Are you ready?

[Intro]
Ow!
Come on!
Yeah!
C-c-c-c-c-come on!

[Verse 1]
Would you please look at this mother next to me
Fronting more booty than Peru got keys
Damn, if I don't get that
Wait right there and I'll be right back
Got a new trick in the back of my car
It's kinda like a movie but you're the star
Lights, camera, make a scene

[Hook]
The Endorphinmachine
Go baby
The Endorphinmachine
Yeah, go baby (Go baby)

[Verse 2]
Tippy, tippy, tin my friend or shall we begin?
Step right up and I'll strap you in
Don't be shy, this won't hurt a bit
Unless of course you don't believe in it
As sure as the dippy dippy wave of my 'do
You'll believe in something before this night is through
Press one for the money, press two for the dream
And get ready for something that You've never seen

[Hook]
The Endorphinmachine
Go baby
The Endorphinmachine
Yeah, go baby (Go baby)

[Ad lib]
Tommy Barbarella, turn it on
Uh huh, uh huh

[Verse 3]
Hold up, wait a minute
Ain't no good unless somebody else is in it
You there with the cynical disposition
Perhaps you'd like to join us in a mission
Of fishing for logic in a think tank
Unless, of course, you're feeling like a punk and take the bank
But every now and then there comes a time you must defend
Your right to die and live again, live again, live again
Get up, get up, get in
The Endorphinmachine

[Chorus]
It's alright, baby (Go Baby)
Don't be shy (The Endorphinmachine)
Yeah, I ain't going to hurt you
Go baby
Come on, come on (Endorphinmachine)
Well, I told ya (Go baby)
The Endorphinmachine
Go baby, go baby, go, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Don't make me!

Que viva para siempre el Poder de la Nueva Generacion

[Verse 1: Prince]
There's a mountain, and it's mighty high
You cannot see the top, unless you fly
And there's a molehill of proven ground
There ain't no where to go if you hang around

[Chorus: Prince]
Everybody wants to sell what's already been sold
Everybody wants to tell what's already been told
What's the use of money if you ain't gonna break the mold?
Even at the center of fire, there is cold
All that glitters ain't gold
All that glitters ain't gold

[Verse 2: Prince]
There's an ocean of despair
There are people livin' there
They're unhappy each and every day
But hell is not fashion so whatcha tryin' to say?

[Chorus: Prince]
Everybody wants to sell what's already been sold
Everybody wants to tell what's already been told
What's the use of money if you ain't gonna break the mold?
Even at the center of fire, there is cold
All that glitters ain't gold, no no
All that glitters ain't gold, no no

[Verse 3: Prince]
There's a lady, 99 years old
If she led a good life, heaven takes her soul
Now that's a theory, and if you don't wanna know
Step aside and make a way for those who want to go

[Chorus: Prince]
Everybody wants to sell what's already been sold (Sold)
Everybody wants to tell what's already been told (Told)
What's the use of bein' young if you ain't gonna get old? (Old)
Even at the center of fire, there is cold (Cold)
All that glitters (glitters) ain't gold, no, no, no
No, no
All that glitters ain't gold (Hey, alright)
All that glitters
All that glitters
All that glitters
Ain't gold

Could you be the most beautiful girl in the world?
It's plain to see you're the reason that God made a girl

[Verse 1]
When the day turns into the last day of all time
I can say I hope you are in these arms of mine
And when the night falls before that day I will cry
I will cry tears of joy cuz after you all one can do is die, oh

Could you be the most beautiful girl in the world?
Could you be?
It's plain to see you're the reason that God made a girl
Oh, yes you are

I can try but when I do I see you and I'm devoured, oh yes

Oh, I could bow (bow down) and feel proud in the light of this power
Oh yes, oh

Could you be the most beautiful girl in the world?

If this is the same avenue my ancestors fought to liberate
How come I can't buy a piece of it even if my credit's straight?
If all the water's dirty and I wanna lay the pipe, my dammy
The river that I drink from, will it be the same as your mammy?

In the daytime, ha, I think not!
I'd rather do U after school like some homework
Ah... am I getting you hot? (Hot)
In my bedroom (No!) cuz then we'd have to stop (Please don't stop)
I'd rather wait until everyone's fast asleep
Then do it in the kitchen on the table top, oh!
We gotta break it on down (down, down, down)

Shhh - break it down
I don't want nobody else to hear the sounds

Besides, I can be your fire baby, yeah
Dripping all over you like a ball of wax, relax and let go!

[Verse 1]
How beautiful do the words have to be
Before they conquer every heart?
How will you know if I'm even in the right key
If you make me stop before I start?

[Chorus]
If I came back as a dolphin
Would you listen to me then?
Would you let me be your friend?
Would you let me in?
You can cut off all my fins
But to your ways I will not bend
I'll die before I let you tell me how to swim
And I'll come back again as a dolphin

[Verse 2]
Why does my brother have to go hungry
When you told him there was food for all?
This is the man that stands next to the man
That stands to catch you when you fall (Oh!)

[Chorus]
If I came back as a dolphin
Would you listen to me then?
Would you let me be your friend?
Would you let me in?
You can cut off all my fins
But to your ways I will not bend
I'll die before I let you tell me how to swim
And I'll come back again as a dolphin

[Bridge]
If I'm under water, will you find me? (Find me)
Will you shine a light and try to guide me?
It's happened before, I've knocked on your door
But you wouldn't let me in
How beautiful do the words have to be
Before they conquer every heart? (Oh!)

[Chorus]
If I came back as a dolphin
Would you listen to me then?
Would you let me be your friend?
Would you let me in?
You can cut off all my fins
But to your ways I will not bend
I'll die before I let you tell me how to swim
And I'll come back again as a dolphin

[Verse 2]
Three, four, three, four, 99
She the new hero cuz she's so divine
Unaffected by the system, she'd rather die
Than write a rap for some big booty heffa gettin' by
On that booty, instead of doin' duty
Aspire to be higher I admire so I fire
Cuz it's flyer to be hungry than phat
And take it from this sister, y'all take it from that
It's flyer to be hungry than phat
The ride up front is better when You've been in the back
And that's a fact
This ain't about this y'all, it ain't about that
This ain't about the booty movin' pumpin' the max
This ain't about this, that, what, where, or how
This about the freaks doin' everything they wanna do now!

Now you want to play? (Get funky)

[Verse 3]
40, 45, snake's alive
Say one thing, do another, it's time
We chill on that
No, I don't need a gat
I'd rather see your self-checkin' ass up to bat for another swing
Anybody can sing
There's more to genius than the word, my sister anything I would bring
Or would u rather dine alone well
If you change your mind, you can reach me on your video phone
It's a dime, as in dollars, and that's my two bloody cents
This ain't about this, that, what, where, or how
This about the freaks doin' everything they wanna do now!

[Chorus]
Now! (1 2 3 4, come on, come on, freaks on the floor)
(Go go yeah) (Now) (Go go yeah)

Sixty seven sixty seven
Freaks dance like they're in heaven
DJ don't stop the music, DJ don't stop the music
Fill us with de dope track, lick us, twist us, roll us in your mouth
Light us up and take a hit, light us up and take a hit
Mmm, suck us til we're dry
And when we're lookin' like a roach, hit the lights
Before u say goodnight though
Let's make a toast yo
This ain't about this, that, what, where, or how
This about the freaks doin' everything they wanna do now!

[Verse 2]
I got a good shot, put your leg on the chair (Like that?)
You know you're too hot when you play with your hair (Ha ha ha)
I like it
I just want to holler, scream, and shout
When you let your fingers do the walking in and out and all about
319

[Interlude]
Ah hoochie, don't do that
You.. you.. you make me want to dance!
Now watch this

Come here, where you going?

Oh

[Verse 1]
After a month of just being alone he said, "I wonder what L.A.'s thinking"
Streets he roamed in search of a poem amongst the wild and drinking
When he sees cool dark skin in hot virgin white
The search was over at least for tonight
When she co-signed and then told him she was ...

[Chorus]
Shy - Cool dark skin in hot virgin white
Shy - Lips say won't but her body say might
Shy - Looks like we're going to take the long way home tonight
Oh baby (Shy)

[Verse 2]
After a look much louder than words she said, "I passed my initiation
A friend of mine, he got killed and in retaliation
I shot the boy ("Pop! Pop!"), huh, twice in the head
No regrets, no sorrow - I'm going back tomorrow to make sure he's dead
Cuz if I don't, they'll call me a chicken, but you can call me ... "

[Chorus]
Shy - Cool dark skin in hot virgin white
Shy - Lips say won't but her body say might
Shy - Looks like we're going to take the long way home tonight
Oh baby (Shy)

[Bridge]
Shy - Lips say no but the body say might
Looks like we're going to take the long way home..
Looks like we're going to take the long way home..
Looks like we're going to take the long way home tonight

[Verse 3]
The girl was rough, but he called her bluff
And he told her not to know was better
Fact or fiction he wondered
And that's when the rain and thunder got wetter
And at the top of the page he wrote ...

[Chorus]
Shy - Cool dark skin in hot virgin white
Shy - Looks like we're going to take the long way home tonight
Shy - Cool dark skin in hot virgin white
Shy - Lips say won't but her body say might
Shy - Looks like we're going to take the long way home tonight
(Oh, say it now, yeah)
(Shy, shy!)
(Shy)

[Outro]
Ooh baby, don't you want to be alone tonight?
Shy - Yeah (Oh yes)
Shy (Shy)
Shy - Looks like we're going to take the long way home tonight

[Verse 1]
Billy Jack Bitch (Billy Jack, Billy Jack)(Bitch)
What if I called you silly names
Just like the ones that you call me?
What if I filled your eyes with tears
So many that you cannot see?

[Chorus]
Billy Jack Bitch - Do you ever really cry? (Billy Jack Bitch)
Billy Jack Bitch - Do you ever really try? (Billy Jack Bitch)
Billy Jack Bitch - Do you ever wonder why? (Billy Jack Bitch)
Billy Jack Bitch (Billy Jack Bitch)
(Billy Jack Bitch)

[Verse 2]
What if I told you that you're worth
Only half of what you be?
Would you come forth and tell no lies?
Would you come forth and talk to me?

[Chorus]
Billy Jack Bitch - Do you ever really cry? (Billy Jack Bitch)
Billy Jack Bitch - Do you ever really try? (Billy Jack Bitch)
Billy Jack Bitch - Do you ever wonder why? (Billy Jack Bitch)
Billy Jack Bitch (Billy Jack Bitch)
(Billy Jack Bitch)

[Verse 3]
What distortion could you let your pen forget today?
What misfortune left your heart so broken you only say
Words intended to belittle or dismay?
What if I say you lie?
Billy Jack Bitch (Well)
Open letters aren't the only things that open wounds
Long hard shiny rocket ships can fly you to the moon
Whenever evil wants to groove
Come let me fly you to the moon
Then you can see how love will bloom
Joy - it's in the dictionary
See "J" Billy Jack Bitch

[Chorus]
Do you ever really cry? (Do you ever really cry Billy Jack Bitch?)
Do you ever really try? (Do you ever really try Billy Jack Bitch?)
Do you ever wonder why? (Do you ever wonder why Billy Jack Bitch?)
Oh, Billy Jack Bitch (Billy Jack Bitch)
Billy, Billy, oh yeah yeah yeah!
(Do you ever really cry Billy Jack Bitch?)
(Do you ever really try Billy Jack Bitch?) Cry, cry
(Do you ever wonder why Billy Jack Bitch?) Try, try

(Billy Jack Bitch)
Ha ha ha ha ha
Y'all some tight motherfuckers

[Intro: Rain Ivana]
You have just accessed the Hate Experience
Do you wish to change your entry?
Very well, please enjoy your experience

[Verse 1: Prince]
I never thought that you would be the one
After all the things that we've been through
You gave your body to another in the name of fun
I hope you had some baby, if not, boo hoo

[Chorus: Prince]
It's so sad but I hate you like a day without sunshine
It's so bad but I hate you 'cause you're all that's ever on my mind
Honey, I hate you
Now everyday would be a waste of time
'Cause I hate you

[Verse 2: Prince]
I never thought that I could feel this way
To fall in love was a table reserved for fools
Say you're sorry if you wanna but it's all in vain
I'm out the door sweet baby, that's right, we're through

[Chorus: Prince]
It's so sad but I hate you like a day without sunshine
It's so bad but I hate you 'cause you're all that's ever on my mind
Honey, I hate you
Now everyday would be a waste of time
'Cause I hate you

[Spoken Interlude: Prince]
This court is now in session
Would the defendant please rise?
State your name for the court
Never mind
Billy Jack Bitch
You're being charged with one to many counts of heartbreaking
In the first degree
I don't give a damn about the others
My main concern is you and me
Your honor, may I call to the stand my one and only witness?
A girl that know damn well she didn't have no damn business
I know what  did, how you did it and, uh, who you did it with
So you might as well plead guilty 'cause you sure can't plead the fifth
Now raise your right hand
Do you swear to tell the whole truth
Not the half truth like you used to so help you God?
Nod your head one time if you hear me
If you don't, I'll have to use the rod
Anything to make you see that uh.. you re going to miss me
Yeah, you're gonna miss me
Uh, uh, uh, oh!
If it please the court
I'd like to have the defendant place her hands behind her back
So I can tie her up tight and get into the act
The act of showing her how good it used to be
I want it to be so good she falls back in love with me
Close your eyes
I'm gonna cover your ass with this sheet
And I want you to pump your hips like you used to
And, baby, you better stay on the beat
Did you do to your other man the same things that you did to me?
Right now I hate you so much I wanna make love until you see
That it's killin' me, baby, to be without you
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was to be with you, ow!

[Outro: Prince]
I hate you
I hate you
Because I love you
Because I love you
But I can't love you
I can't love you
Because I hate you
I hate you
Because I love you
I love you, baby
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you 'cause you're all that's ever on my mind
I hate you because I love you

[Verse 1]
Heard about the party now
Just east of Harlem
Doug E's going to be there
But you got to call him

Even the soldiers
Need a break sometimes
Listen to the groove, y'all
Let it unwind your mind

No intoxication
Unless you see what I see
Dancing hot and sweaty
Right in front of me

Oh, call it what you like
I'm going to call it how it be
This is just another one of God's gifts
Musicology

[Chorus]
You gotta keep the party movin'
Just like I told you
Kick the old school joint
For the true funk soldiers
Musicology

[Verse 2]
Wish I had a dollar
For every time they say
Don't you miss the feeling music gave you
Back in the day?

Let's Groove "September"
Earth, Wind and Fire
"Hot Pants" by James
Sly is gonna take you higher

Minor keys and drugs
Don't make a roller skate jam
Take your pick, turntable or a band?
Lordy

If it ain't Chuck D or Jam Master Jay
Know what? They're losing
'Cause we got a PhD in
Advanced Body Movin'

[Chorus]
Keep the party movin'
Just like I told you
Kick the old-school joints
For the true funk soldiers
Musicology!
All right
Hold it down, band

[Spoken Interlude]
"Get back! Move, get back!
Don't you touch my stereo, these are my records!
Don't touch, ever touch, these are my records!"

[Refrain]
Musicology
Musicology

[Breakdown]
Everybody get down!
Upstroke!
Old-school joints
For the true funk soldiers
Good God
Keep the party movin'
Keep the party movin'
Uh, don't stop dancin'
Keep, keep, keep the party movin'
Musicology
Keep the party movin'
Just like I told ya
Kick the old-school joints
For the true funk soldiers
Musicology

For the true funk soldiers
Good God
On the one, y'all
Don't you hear this old school joint?
Don't you ever touch my stereo
He said I got good and plenty of what you need the most
And that's time

[Outro]
If I was your girlfriend
Seventeen days
Watch it now
Uh
Oh Yeah
Rockin' you coast to coast...
Little red corvette
Hip and lips, chips and whips

[Chorus]
She knew which fork to use but she couldn't dance
So he hipped her to the funk in exchange for the finance
Who's pimping who if nobody gets a second chance?
This is the story of illusion, coma, pimp, and circumstance

[Verse 1]
She was older but rich beyond compare
Drop a thousand dollars at the salon just to get her hair did
He was good at compliments, better in the bunk
She laced him with a crib in Paris, he hipped her to the funk

Way too fine he was for her
A dirty dog in expensive fur
As long as she's providing chips and whips
We can do this funky thing

As long as she was playing the host
He figured he would make the most of them hips and lips
He hooked her up, rocked her coast to coast
(Ugly) So ugly, rich beyond compare
She's dropped a couple hundred thousand dollars on a silver whip
Just to match the colour of her hair
She said "I got plenty of what you need
Put the spoon down honey, came on, let mama feed you"

[Chorus]
She knew which fork to use but she couldn't dance
So he hipped her to the funk in exchange for the finance
Who's pimping who if nobody gets a second chance?
This is the story of illusion, coma, pimp, and circumstance

[Verse 2]
Where was I? Oh yeah
A gentleman he was
He never spoke about her nose
So prominent because in the dark it'd glow
If she was only tan instead of so lily white
Her name was Doris but he called her "Fluo"
As in "-Rescent" - That ain't right
Fluorescent every night
A situation bound to fail
As sure as Doris's skin was pale
Money might talk, but what does it say?
You better get busy if you want to get paid
"Boy, I was fine back in the day"

[Chorus]
She knew which fork to use but she couldn't dance
So he hipped her to the funk in exchange for the finance
Who's pimping who if nobody gets a second chance?
This is the story of illusion, coma, pimp, and circumstance

[Verse 3]
He spent her money oh so well
Take a bath in cold Cristal
He took a trip to burn an old flame in Frisco, like wow
But Doris caught him in her arms
She shrugged her shoulders and said "No harm"
Just put your name on this pre-nup and we can all hit the disco

[Chorus]
She knew which fork to use but she couldn't dance
So he hipped her to the funk in exchange for the finance
Who's pimping who if nobody gets a second chance?
This is the story of illusion, coma, pimp, and circumstance

She knew which fork to use but she couldn't dance
So he hipped her to the funk in exchange for the finance
Who's pimping who if nobody gets a second chance?
This is the story of illusion, coma, pimp, and circumstance

[Outro]
Now, dance
Dance

[Verse 1]
It's only been a hour since you left me
But it feels like a million days
If I had a magic wand I could turn back time
I'd never let you go away

I didn't have the heart to say I'm sorry
Now I haven't got a heart at all
I could tolerate the pain if I could talk to my best friend
But you won't even call
You won't even call

[Verse 2]
I'm contemplating pulling out my suitcase
And packing everything I own
I didn't back then but I do know now
Wherever you are is home
I'd crawl on my belly and beg you
But you're so far away

[Refrain]
Only been gone for an hour
But it seems like a million days
A million days
A million days

[Breakdown]
It's only been a hour since you left me
I wish I had somebody to blame
But you're the perfect picture of what love should look like
And I want to be your frame

[Refrain]
It's only been a hour but it feels like a million days

[Outro]
A million days
One hundred thousand million days
Come home, come home baby
I can't take this no more

A million days
Well, come home girl oh yeah
Baby, baby, baby, baby
A million days
I know I shouldn't put my faith in heroes
But I can't see you any other way
A million days
It's only been a hour since you left me girl
Feels like a million, feels like a million days
Come on home, baby

[Intro]
This is the life of the party
We going to do it right

[Verse 1]
So you're having a party?
Goody for you
All the beautiful people going to be there
Yeah, that's cool
You know you're gonna have a good time
Because you got the news
That the life o' the party
Is going to party with you
We're doing our own thing
'Til the sun come up
Sweet Candy going to be there
Yeah, it's gonna be rough
She ain't got no off switch
And neither do I
When you read it in the paper tomorrow
You gonna hang your head and cry

[Chorus]
We gonna have us a party
All are welcome too
We ain't down with nobody
Don't party like we do
Once we get it started
We gotta go all night
This is the life o' the party
We gon' do it right

[Verse 2]
Why party in your own yard
When you can party in mine?
All the beautiful people gonna be there
Putting the I in fine
Throw the records out my window
CDs out the door
Might as well give it to the milkman
But we don't want it no more
Everybody can smell this funk y'all
Down in Atlanta, GA
Everybody, even Dre and 'em
Know it's okay
Hey, we don't need any tripping
You all on this special day
We just call and let you know
You better not come if you can't stay

[Chorus]
We gonna have us a party
All are welcome too
We ain't down with nobody
Don't party like we do
Once we get it started
We gotta go all night
This is the life o' the party
We gon' do it right, horns

[Verse 3]
What's it gonna take to get your booty soaking wet?
You and me closer baby, that's a bet
I'm the life of the party
As long as I got your body
Shaking like a leaf on a tree
Cutie, come dance with me
You and me, we got mad chemistry
Don't it make you wanna holler?
Come with the life of the party, y'all
We're still making dollars
Twenty-five years to life
The judge sentenced me to hard labor with a knife
Making cuts for you all
Keeping the party packed and wall to wall
I don't care what they say
"He don't play the hits no more
Plus I thought he was gay"
But it ain't nothing if it ain't fun
My voice is getting higher
And I ain't never had my nose done
That's the other guy
All the purple hippies bang your head on the one

[Chorus]
We gonna have us a party
All are welcome too
We ain't down with nobody
Don't party like we do
Once we get it started
We gotta go all night
This is the life o' the party
We gon' do it right

We gonna have us a party
All are welcome too
We ain't down with nobody
Don't party like we do
Once we get it started
We gotta go all night
This is the life o' the party
We gon' do it right

[Outro]
Life o' the party
Life o' the party

[Intro]
Call, call my name
Call it, call my name

[Verse 1]
I've heard your voice this morning
Calling out my name
It had been so long, since I've heard
That it didn't really sound quite the same, no

But it let me know that my name
Had never really been spoken before
Before the day I carried you
Through the bridal path door

And ever since that day I haven't wanted anyone but you
And anybody who really knows me knows the truth
That I

[Chorus]
I just can't stop writing songs about you
I love you so much
I just can't wait to get my arms around you
And feel your touch
If I don't see you real soon, baby girl
I might go insane
I know it's only been three hours
But I love it when you call my name, yes I do

[Verse 2]
I heard a voice on the news saying
People wanna stop the war (Stop the war)
If they had a love as sweet as you
They'd forget what they were fighting for

What's the matter with the world today?
The land of the free, somebody lied
They can bug my phone and peep around my home
They'll only see you and me making love inside

[Chorus]
I just can't stop writing songs about you
I love you so much
I just can't wait to get my arms around you
And feel your touch
If I don't see you real soon, baby girl
I might go insane
I know it's only been three hours
But I love it when you call my name, yes I do

[Verse 3]
I never seen the moon look so lovely
As the night I saw it with you
Let me know I'd never seen the moon before
So many speak of the moon
As though it had no flaws
But to compare it to a beauty like yours
Would give one pause
Nothing about you is false
That's why your love is real
That's why your love is real love
God forbid if you belonged to another
I'd have to steal you

I'd have to take you from your man
I might be tempted to break the law 'round here
Because your beauty it gives one pause
It slows me down

[Chorus]
I just can't stop writing songs about you
I love you so much
I just can't wait to get my arms around you
And feel your touch
If I don't see you real soon, baby girl
I might go insane, right
I know it's only been three hours
But I love it when you call my name, yes I do

[Outro]
I love it when you call my name
Call, call my name
Call it, call my name

[Verse 1]
As war drums beat in Babylon
Cinnamon Girl starts to pray
I never heard a prayer like this one
Never before that day

[Pre-Chorus]
Tearful words of love for people she had never met before
Asking God to grant them mercy in this face of a holy war

[Chorus]
Cinnamon Girl
Cinnamon Girl

[Verse 2]
Cinnamon Girl of mixed heritage
Never knew the meaning of color lines
9-1-1 turned that all around
When she got accused of this crime

[Pre-Chorus]
So began the mass illusion, war on terror alibi
What's the use when the God of Confusion keeps on telling the same lie?

[Chorus]
Cinnamon Girl
Cinnamon Girl

[Bridge]
Don't cry, don't shed no tears
One night won't make us feel
'Cause we know how this movie's ending

[Chorus]
Cinnamon Girl
Cinnamon Girl

[Verse 3]
As war drums beat in Babylon
And scorch the blood red sky
Militants bomb the foreign gun
Both side's children die

[Pre-Chorus]
Cinnamon Girl opens the book she knows will settle all the scores
Then she prays after the war that there will not be any more

[Chorus]
Cinnamon Girl
Cinnamon Girl
Cinnamon Girl
Don't worry, baby, it's gonna be alright
Cinnamon Girl

[Verse]
I can't wait until I see my, my baby's face
When I tell him that I'm through
Yes, I'm through with him
Because he's been running round
And I got to, to put him down
I can't wait to see the look
The look in his eyes
I wonder if he'll cry
When I tell him this is goodbye, yes it is
Or will he try to change my mind
And make me stay? yeah
Or will he turn around
And, with a smile on his face
Just walk away?
Just walk away
I can't wait until I see my, my baby's face
Got to find out what I mean
What I mean to him
Because just one tear is all he's got to, to shed for me
And I know that l will run, yes I'll run to him
I'll hold him tight
Never, never let him go, no-o-o

[Outro]
And I can't wait until I see my, my baby's face
You know, I just can't wait until I see my baby's, baby's face
You know, I just can't wait until I see my, my baby's face
I can't wait until I

[Verse 1]
If you leave her now
You are never going to see her again, never
Now she's going to need a shoulder to cry on
She's going to need a friend

She's going to need a pillow case
Something to put those tears on
And I've got some purple satin laces
One second later than the second you're gone

She's going to miss you at first
But then she's gonna buy me things
That's when I'm going to a lay her
'Cross my piano stool and sing to her

[Chorus]
Honey, I tried to tell him
That you were the marrying kind
A faithful one-man woman
The best he would ever find
I guess he wasn't trying to hear that
So there ain't nothin' left to say
I tried to tell him if you run to me I
I won't run away

[Verse 2]
If you leave her now
You'll never get another glimpse
I'm going to lace her with enough ice to recap the polls
There might be another solar eclipse

She's gonna find out what I like on my eggs
My bathwater, how I like to be touched
I'm going to put her on the same diet Missy went on
You know she eat too much

Tonight, she's gonna miss you at first
Then she'll get used to me
All of the tricks I would try
To make her take this ring and make love to me

[Chorus]
I tried, honey, I tried to tell him
That you were the marrying kind
A faithful one-man woman
The best he would ever find
I guess he wasn't trying to hear that
So there ain't nothing left to say
I tried to tell him if you run to me
I won't run away

[Outro]
Run away
Run away, ah ah
Don't run away

[Chorus]
If I was the man in your life
I'd make you happy, I'd treat you right
I'd buy you flowers every single day
I'd give you power, I'd do whatever you say

[Verse 1]
I heard a rumor that you are man he said he'd do you wrong
And you are so vain you'd think that you are the one behind this song
Sure you know he got plenty lyrics, yeah, up his sleeve
And after he got what he want he just go up and leave
And Sunday chocolate on the roof right after his game
He like the Lakers but the Sixers on when he came
If he's with another now you best believe the party's crackin'
You are getting played girl, you better get your mack on

[Pre-Chorus]
And do onto others as they do onto you
You call me on the day that you and him are just too through
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
If I was the man in your life
I'd make you happy, I'd treat you right
I'd buy you flowers every single day
I'd give you power, I'd do whatever you say

[Verse 2]
Was it you that I saw outside the liquor store
Waiting on that fool to purchase what you been dying for?
And before I see you drop a spill I have to bring you down
Now you got that chocolate barracuda hangin' 'round
Hangin' 'round your neck like a cheap gold chain
He don't deserve to say that he ever knew your name
Much less he get to smell the perfume I gave you
Please don't tell me that you all got down

[Pre-Chorus]
Better do onto others as they do onto you
You call me on the day that you and him are just too through

[Chorus]
If I was the man in your life
I'd make you happy, I'd treat you right
I'd buy you flowers every single day
I'd give you power, I'd do whatever you say
Do whatever you say

[Verse 1]
Come on, baby
Ooh, ooh
Don't make me sleep on the couch
No, no, no
Love Jones is on the TV again, baby
Ooh, I wanna go down south, yeah

[Verse 2]
Come on, baby
Come on, baby
It's so undignified to sleep alone
Oh, yes it is
That's what all the people ain't got nobody do
You know they do
Talking on the telephone

[Verse 3]
Don't make me crash
Don't you do it baby
(Don't you do it, uh-uh)
Don't make me sleep without your kiss
Oh darling, without your kiss
(Don't you make me do it)
Tossing and a-turning
Every inch of me yearning

[Refrain]
Don't you make me
Don't you make me
Don't you make me
Don't you make me
Don't you make me
Don't you make me
Don't you make me
Don't you make me suffer for this

[Verse 4]
I know, I know, I know, I know that
We agreed to be married
(You know I know)
Shouldn't let me unzip your dress
Why'd you do it, baby
Why'd you do it, oh yeah
Confess you tease, unless you please me
Don't make me
Don't make me sleep on the couch

[Verse 1]
Two sevens together
Like time, indefinite
Trying to catch the glass before it falls
Without a frown
Can you turn up the stereo?
I want to play you this old song, it's about love
Can I do that?

[Verse 2]
Did we remember to water the plants today?
I forgot to look up at the moon because
I was too busy, said I was too busy
I was too busy
Looking at you babe
Still it's nice to know
That, uh when bodies wear out
We can get another

[Verse 3]
What does that one thing have to do
With the other one?
I don't know
I was just thinking about my mother
You know what
Turn the stereo back down
Ain't nothing worse than an old worn out love song
Tell me do you like my hair this way
Remember all the way back in the day
When we would compare whose afro was the roundest

[Verse 4]
Mirrored tiles above the bed
Fishing nets and posters all over the wall, oh yes
Sometimes, sometimes I just want to go sit out on the stoop
And, uh, play my guitar
Just watch all, all the cars go by

[Verse 1]
Imagine holding Planet Earth
In the palm of your hand
With no regard for your place of birth
Or claim to any land
The only thing between us now
Is the truth we understand
If Planet Earth was in the palm of your hand

[Verse 2]
Fifty years from now
What will they say about us here?
Did we care for the water and
The fragile atmosphere?
There are only two kind of folk
And the difference they make
The ones that give and the ones that take

[Chorus]
Just like the countless bodies
That revolve around the sun
Planet Earth must now come into balance with the one
That caused it all to be
Then we'll see His kingdom come
So shall it be written, shall be sung

[Verse 3]
Imagine you could rid the Earth
Of anyone you choose
Which ones would you need the most
And which ones would you lose?
Do we want to judge another
Lest we be judged too?
Careful now, the next one might be you

[Chorus]
Just like the countless bodies
That revolve around the sun
Planet Earth must now (right now) come into balance with the one
That caused it all to be
And then we'll see His kingdom come
So shall it be written, shall be sung

[Verse 4]
Imagine sending your first born
Off to fight a war
With no good reason how it started
Or what they are fighting for
And if they're blessed to make it home
Will they still be poor?
Pray for peace right now and forever more

[Chorus]
Just like the countless bodies
That revolve around the sun
Planet Earth must now come into balance with the one
That caused it all to be
Then we'll see His kingdom come
So shall it be written, shall be sung
Say it one more time

Just like the countless bodies
That revolve around the sun
Planet Earth must now come into balance with the one
That caused it all to be
Then we'll see His kingdom come (see His kingdom come)
So shall it be written, shall be sung (shall be sung)
Oh yeah, yeah

So shall it be written, shall be sung

[Humming]

[Verse 1]
When I was a child, I heard voices
Some would sing and some would scream
You soon find you have few choices
I learned the voices died with me
When I was a child, I'd sit for hours
Staring into open flame
Something in it had a power
Could barely tear my eyes away

[Hook]
All you have is your fire
And the place you need to reach
Don't you ever tame your demons
But always keep them on a leash

[Humming]

[Verse 2]
When I was sixteen, my senses fooled me
Thought gasoline was on my clothes
I knew that something would always rule me
I knew this scent was mine alone

[Hook]
All you have is your fire
And the place you need to reach
Don't you ever tame your demons
Always keep them on a leash

[Bridge]
When I was a man, I thought it ended
When I knew love's perfect ache
But my peace has always depended
On all the ashes in my wake

[Outro]
All you have is your fire
And the place you need to reach
Don't you ever tame your demons
But always keep them on a leash

[Spoken]
One after the other, the Banished Ones fled
As they watched from the distance
The destruction of the Digital Garden
With no more fruit to bear from its trees
The Haze was finally broken
With the rains came the awareness that never again
Would anyone ever lay claim to the treasures of the Rainbow Children
As though awakened from a dream
The Muse opened her eyes
This time as Queen

[Verse 1: Kip Blachshire]
Brother, dear brother, I came as quickly as I could
The digital haze is broken
The banished ones are gone for good
Gone for good

[Verse 2: Prince and Milenia]
Now there must be a wedding
A Wedding
Now there must be a feast
A feast, a feast, a smorgasbord at least
A brunch, a munch of cake if just a piece
Not just a vat of chitlins
Or turkey meat you see
We are what we eat, so we must eat a leaf
We'll dine under a tree
Unless it snows

[Verse 1]
With this one I can be what I want to be
I don't have to live up to no one's fantasy
I could write another three hundred melodies
To her it's just three, cause this one
She loves me for me
With this one I don't even have to comb my hair
I can wear what I want to or nothing, she don't care
I don't even have to take her on the rollercoaster, see

[Chorus]
Cause this one, this one
She loves me for me

[Verse 2]
In the morning
When I rise and see her eyes
Look deep into mine
I find a better place
This one I can tell all my secrets to
I don't need to make her swear, she would never tell any who
Besides I'm the only one she ever wants to see

[Chorus]
Cause this one, this one
She loves me for me

[Bridge]
When the night falls
And she calls
I run to her side
'Cause she got the ride that I like to ride
I like to ride it

[Verse 3]
This one I can take over my mamma's house
And I don't have to worry what goes in and out her mouth
All she needs is a little gratuity
She don't like no beef

[Chorus]
She just loves me for me
She just loves me for me

[Chorus]
This one, this one, ooh
She loves me for me

Welcome, you have just accessed
The Akashic Records Genetic Information Division
This program is required for those wishing
To obtain a marriage blessing from the Kingdom
When you wish to begin this program
Place your right hand on the scanner
And tightly clench up your butt cheeks
As you might feel a slight electrical shock
Please, select the race history you desire
You have selected African American, this is your history

[Spoken: Prince]
First of all, the term, black and white is a fallacy
It simply is another way of saying, this or that
Let's examine the term, this or that in its ultimate form
Which is, this means the truth or that which is resistant to it
When a minority realizes its similarities on a higher level
Not just black but people of color and higher, still indigenous
And even higher, still from the tribe of and yet higher
The rainbow children, when this understanding comes
The so-called minority becomes a majority in the wink of an eye
This action will cause a reaction or resistance
The source of this resistance must be banished
As it is in direct conflict with the initial action
It cannot be assimilated, for its very nature is resistance
In other words, one cannot serve two masters
You are either this, or that which is not this
End of part one, to continue, select the program
Family name and type in the current government
Name you wish history on

London, England sometime in the early 1600s
We have the God given right to run out of our colonies
Anyone who does not bow down to our law, hear, hear
Come on, come on keep it moving here, what's your name boy?
Abu Cah
Well it ain't now, it's Tom Lynch

[Verse 1: Prince]
Mirror, mirror what you see?
Have I still got those dark clouds over me?
Or am I really feeling what I feel?
The last days of the Devil's deal
Mirror, what you see?

[Verse 2: Prince]
Devil, devil, what you know?
You been here since 1914 but now you got to go
You been hiding behind corporate eyes
You want to war but you can't fight
Devil, you got to go, yes sir

[Chorus: Prince]
Bridge
You might say, "What you mad about?"
But you still got your family name
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Rosen Bloom
I'll be John Blackwell just the same
What's your family name?

[Verse 3: Prince]
Teacher, teacher what you say?
Did we really come over in a boat?
Did it really go down that way?
Or did I arrive before you, ruin Thanksgiving Day?
Teacher, what you say?

[Verse 5: Prince]
Preacher, preacher, is it true
That Jesus wants me to give my money to the likes of you?
Ride around in your Lexus Coupe
Drive us to the cleaners in a pinstripe suit
Preacher, that ain't truth

[Chorus: Prince]
To the bridge
You might say, "What you mad about?
But you still got your family name
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Pearlman
You can call me Clay
Can I play?

[Verse 6: Prince]
People, people what's your name?
Maybe, we should start all over
Let everybody get in the game
Put up a one gloved fist
Make a sound, Violet Brown

[Outro: Prince and Martin Luther King Jr.]
You might say, "What you mad about?
You still got your Family name
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Gold Struck
We found this tape in the Akashic records
This is Thomas Jefferson
My fellow Americans, if there is a just God
We're going to pay for this
Black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics
We'll be able to join hands in the words of the old Negro spiritual
Free at last, free at last, thank God Almighty, we are free at last

[Verse 1]
I knew this dude
He was very cool
He used to rule
Until he went to school
Not a normal school
That breeds a fool
But the ones that teaches
Men aren't fit to rule
That's when he took his pearly crown
He raised it up and spun it 'round
And tossed into the deep blue underground
No longer lead by the ways of men
He looked for the kingdom deep within
That's when the drums in his head began to pound

[Chorus]
Don't let nobody bring you down
Accurate knowledge of Christ and the Father
Will bring the Everlasting Now
Join the party, make a sound
Share the truth, preach the good news
Don't let nobody bring you down
The Everlasting Now

[Verse 2]
Now turn the page, at an early age
This brother on stage, he was all the rage
He taught an integrated world to sing
The color you are don't mean a thing
Everybody's a star all the everyday people sang
He changed the funk, put it in a bag
Then he changed the colors of the flag
But you can't teach a dog new tricks if his tail don't wag
Don't know matter how much money u made
All the cars you got and all the women you laid
Mess with the flag and to them you are still a spade

[Chorus]
Don't let nobody bring you down
Accurate knowledge of Christ and the Father
Will bring the Everlasting Now
Join the party, make a sound
Share the truth, preach the good news
Don't let nobody bring you down
The Everlasting Now

[Verse 3]
See this girl in her make-believe world
Plastic boobs and clip-on curls
Around the pole see her big butt twirl
There are the dreams that do unfurl
Never everlasting
Don't let anybody bring u down
The Everlasting Now
Watch that girl in her make-believe world
Plastic boobs and clip-on curls
'Round the pole see her big butt twirl
Electric beaches skin do bake
Vanilla fudge and wedding cake
If you should die before you wake
You got any last requests to make?

[Chorus 2]
The Everlasting Now
The Everlasting Now
The Everlasting Now
Johnny B. Well and bring the beat

[Verse 4]
From this day forward until times indefinite, those who love Christ are the
Ones who benefit. All the players' ice melted into one platinum chain and in
A downward spiral it dropped down the chain
You know, this is funky but I wish he'd play like he used to, old scraggly head."
Don't let nobody bring you down
Accurate knowledge of Christ and the Father
Will bring the Everlasting Now
Join the party, come on make a sound
Share the truth, preach the good news
Don't let nobody bring you down
The Everlasting Now

[Chorus 2]
The Everlasting Now
The Everlasting Now
The Everlasting Now
Johnny B. Well and bring the beat

[Verse 1]
What if another universe, complete with sun and moon
An entire galaxy and, what's worse, you and I too soon
Find each other expanding beyond this dirty room
Butterscotch mountains, sunshine

[Refrain]
Boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom

[Verse 2]
Run your fingers up and down the obelisk in the earth
Down to 33 RPMs where the primordial gives birth
Or else we lie neck high, you and I in one another's grooves
Volcano magic, sometimes we go

[Refrain]
Boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom

[Verse 3]
Everybody knows what happens when you worship from afar
The ebb and flow of angels dancing around the star
And if the sunrise is still in question, the answer's in the dark
Celibate mushroom canopy

[Guitar solo]

[Refrain]
Boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom

[Intro]
Uh, get it on
Right on

[Verse 1]
A zero point approaches and the field around you drop
Thoughts become reality and it feels like time has stopped
When all that's on the radio is electromagnetic pop
Steady your teeth and gnash

[Refrain]
Compassion
Get it on
Compassion
Right on

[Verse 2]
When the love for the greater number freezes over and cools
And everyone around you acts like a bloody fool
No sanctity to the left of you, no righteousness to the right
The only thing that's left in fashion

[Refrain]
Compassion
Get it on
Compassion

[Chorus]
Whatever skin you're in
We all need to be friends
All happy again
So much better than nothing
Everybody can win
With a little faith in men
Beginning of an end
The start of a brand new something

[Verse 3]
When ego, fear, and judgment become the rule of law
Watch the polar ice caps heat up, melt down, and thaw
When the greedy one forgets that he's the reason for it all
The only gold that's so worth stashin'

[Refrain]
Compassion
Get it on
Compassion
Right on

[Bridge]
When the highest seat in office, no love can be found
Nature will rise against nature and get down
Ooh
Ow
Come on

[Chorus]
Whatever skin you're in
We all need to be friends
All happy again
So much better than nothing
Everybody can win
With a little faith in man
Beginning of an end
The start of a brand new something

[Verse 4]
If you got compassion
Let's get back in fashion
The new international anthem

[Chorus]
Whatever skin you're in
We all need to be friends
All happy again
So much better than nothing
Everybody can win
With a little faith in men
Beginning of an end
The start of a brand new something

[Chorus]
Whatever skin you're in
(Whatever skin you're in)
We all need to be friends
(Black and white and yellow, we can be friends)
All happy again
It's so much better than nothing
Everybody, everybody can win with a little faith in men
Beginning of the end to start up a brand new somethin'
Ooh ooh, to start up a brand new somethin', yeah
Whatever skin you're in

[Verse 1]
If your last December came
What would you do?
Will anybody remember
To remember you?
Did you stand tall?
Or did you fall?
Did you give your all?

[Verse 2]
Did you ever find a reason
Why you had to die?
Or did you just plan on leaving
Without wondering why?
Was it everything it seemed?
Or did it feel like a dream?
Did you feel redeemed?

[Chorus]
In the name of the father
In the name of the son
We need to come together
Come together as one

[Verse 3]
Did you love somebody
But got no love in return?
Did you understand the real meaning of love?
That it just is and never yearns?
When the truth arrives
We'll be lost on the other side?
Will you still be alive?

[Chorus]
In the name of the father
In the name of the son
We need to come together
Come together as one

[Verse 4]
In your life did you just give a little
Or did you give all that you had?
Were you just somewhere in the middle?
Not too good, not too bad?

[Chorus]
In the name of the father
In the name of the son
We need to come together
Come together as one

[Chorus]
In the name of the father
In the name of the son
We need to come together
Come together as one

[Chorus]
In the name of the father
In the name of the son
We need to come together
Come together as one

[Intro]
Ouh uuuh
Come on

[Verse 1]
I don't hardly know her
But I think I could love her
I hope she walks over
Because I've been waiting to show her
Crimson and clover
Over and over

[Interlude]
Baby, I think I love you
I wanna know for sure
Come here and sock it to me one time
You move me
(Here we go, ooh)

[Verse 2]
Inside your sweet thing
Makes me want to sing
What a beautiful feeling
Crimson and clover
Over and over
Ooh

[Outro]
Baby I, I think I love you
But I want to know for sure
Oh come here, sock it to me one time
Ah, you move me, look out

[Guitar solo]

[Intro]
Uh-huh
The morning after

[Verse 1]
It didn't hit me until the morning after
All eye remember was a kiss and then you were gone
And then I missed your smile, the sound of your laughter
And now I'm sleeping on the side you slept on

[Verse 2]
At first I felt the only reason you left me
Was the proposition that I spoke in your ear
I ain't a doctor but I know this ain't healthy
Instead of counting sheep, I'm counting tears

[Verse 3]
I coulda drove you home but you wouldn't let me
I didn't care how far, or if it was near
Ain't trying to push you because I know you just met me
I'm just wishing that you were here

[Verse 4]
I'm not the kind of man that's sad and lonely
It's just that something tells me your the one
Even if you love somebody else it's only
(You're the one)
Better if I get the chance the moment you're done

[Verse 5]
Please don't tell me that you lost my number
Just come back over if you don't want to call
I've got some music that will make you rhumba
We can jam baby all night long

[Outro]
Ahh, the morning after
Oh
The morning after
Ahh
Ahh, the morning after
It didn't hit me 'til the morning after

[Spoken Intro]
I wanna talk about it
A colonized mind

[Verse 1]
Upload: the evolution principle
See a rock on the shore and say
"It's always been there"
Download: no responsibility
Do what you want, nobody cares

Upload: the master race idea
Genetically disposed to rule the world
Download: a future full of isolated
Full of isolated boys and girls

Upload: a two-party system
The lesser of two dangers, illusion of choice
Download: a veiled form of fascism
Nothing really ever changes
You never had a voice

[Ad lib]
Listen to me one time

[Chorus]
If you look, you’re sure going to find
Throughout mankind's history
A colonized mind
The one in power makes law
Under which the colonized fall
But without God
It's just the blind leading the blind

[Verse 2]
Upload: a joint venture record deal
It's just another way for the man to steal
While he's sticking you with the bill
Download: the temporary acquisition
Of fleeting fame and fortune
Nothing to leave in your will, hey hey hey hey

Wait a minute

Upload: a child with no father
Download: no respect for authority
Upload: a child with no mother
Download: a hard time showing love

[Chorus]
If you look, you’re sure going to find
Through mankind's history
A colonized mind
The one in power makes laws
Under which the colonized fall
But without God
It's just the blind leading the blind

[Intro]
Feel better, feel good, feel wonderful
Feel better, feel good, feel wonderful, hey

[Verse 1]
I could tell by the color of your energy field
You thought this game was over chemical peel
You tried to do me like my good brother Steve
But I got another funky trick up my sleeve

Expecting me to freak on you a little bit more
But you get nothing but well-wishes and flowers galore
I mean no harm, I still got your back
You can come and drink my wine, as a matter of fact

[Chorus]
Feel better, feel good, feel wonderful
Feel better, feel good, feel wonderful

[Verse 2]
I don't know what you thought when you spit in my face
But this dimension ain't the time or the place
I don't know who told you you could stand next to me
But I got a guitar that could part the sea
Don't mean no disrespect, I ain't trying to brag
But that might be the same one that tapped on the crag
And brought forth water that quenched your thirst
And will keep feeding you, but first things first

[Chorus]
Feel better, feel good, feel wonderful
Feel better, feel good, feel wonderful

Sing it, feel better
Feel good

[Verse 3]
If you think about how much time it took
For you to try to get a page in my book
I feel so good right now I just can't recall
What the ---- I was thinking when I threw you the ball

It hit three bystanders after you touched it
Now they want to sue me, but they love me too much
'Cause they know I wish them heaven and all of its gold
Same to you, come on let's groove to the purple rock and roll

[Chorus]
Feel better, feel good, feel wonderful
Feel better, feel good, feel wonderful, yeah
Feel better
(Feel better, baby)
Feel good, feel wonderful
(Y'all ready?)
(Yup)

[Outro]
C’mon
Better than good, better than good
You know you should feel wonderful
Keep your mind in a vertical motion
Always looking up
Hit me!
Feel better, feel good, feel wonderful
Feel better, feel good, feel wonderful
Feel better, feel good, feel wonderful

[Verse 1]
Hey baby, what's your name?
Do you wanna play a game?
Play it like we don't know when
We'll ever get to play again

Experimental, so brand new
The things I wanna do with you
Like a physical kind of blue
Come on, baby, let's get to it

[Chorus]
I want a lover that can improvise
I need a lover that can make me cry
Yeah, uh huh, listen

[Verse 2]
Baby, I don't care what you
Learned in lovemaking school
You and me, we about to jam
Make love like the first woman and man
I don't want to know ahead of time
The notes you play should be a reaction to mine
Nothing planned or contrived
Then both of us will arrive... destination

[Chorus]
I wanna feel like I've been hypnotized
If you think you can, then let's go for a ride
Let's go for a ride
Let's go

[Outro]
Do it to me, baby
Yeah
Now dig

Love like jazz
Love like jazz
Love like jazz
Love like jazz

[Intro]
I’ll say goodbye to all that old friends
Just for you, just for you
If we can be together, just we two

[Verse]
I’ll stay at home all week and weekends
If you’ll be there with me
Our lust will be a drift, you just wait and see
I’ll forget the old days
When running around was fun
Through the years and always
You’ll be the only one

[Outro]
I’ll save my love and my affection
Just for you, I’ll be true
As long as I may live, I’ll live just for you

[Intro]
Groove
Oh
Where am I?

[Verse 1]
Universe of paradoxical design
Reality of merely in the mind
In my head or in some German town
She said, "You want a four leaf clover in the ground?"

Ain't superstitious, and I don't believe in luck
But I heard the thunder before the lightning struck
I couldn't read the writing 'cause it was so small
But according to the document she got on the wall

[Chorus]
She gets down like the wall of Berlin
I come 'round about a quarter to ten
We just met or at least we pretend
It's so fresh knocking down the wall of Berlin
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ahh
Where am I?

[Verse 2]
Galaxy of monumental delight
Or parallel hologram copyright?
The call comes unexpected like a mugger in the park
And the sound of the train interrupts the question mark

[Chorus]
Who you gonna be tonight, baby?
Wall of Berlin
A quarter to ten
Oh
Wall of Berlin
Come on
Uh, ahh
I like it
Who you gonna be tonight?

[Verse 3]
Is that the Queen of Sheba or an alien dream?
The marks on the table say somewhere in between
Not one for rituals, but one thing I have found
Everything's better when you come around

[Chorus]
To get down like the wall of Berlin
I come 'round about a quarter to ten
We just met or, uh, at least we pretend
It's so fresh knocking down the wall of Berlin

Knock it, baby
Wall of Berlin

Wall of Berlin

Ow!
Wall of Berlin

On the one

[Verse 1]
Here she come, the most popular girl in the whole wide world today
You don't know if she would, but what's good is she'd come and look your way
You're standing over there trying to be gangster, copping your favorite lean
You give her the head nod
Oh my god, you're the craziest thing she's ever seen

[Chorus]
But you’re dancing
And she's loving you all night long
In your little world, she's your best girl
It's all money, ain't nothing wrong

You’re dancing
Oh, she's loving you all night long
Funky dollar bill, it's real, y'all
Easy come, easy gone

[Verse 2]
Where you go, everybody want to know
So they can put it in a magazine
Next to the ad for the latest fad
In black hair care – Vaseline
With this car, these rims, this grill
You'll be the illest on the scene
Whatever whatever, all you need is your music
And you'll be a party machine

[Chorus]
'Cause you'll be dancing
Mm, she'll be loving you all night long
In your little world, she's your best girl
It's money, ain't nothing wrong

You're dancing, yes, you are
She's loving you all night long
Funky dollar bill, it's real, y'all
Easy come, easy gone

Mmm
One, two

[Verse 3]
How many times you look for happy
And you never see the rich folks there?
But if the DJ really dropped a needle
All the true players just don't care

When all the news just give me the blues
And make you wanna pop a pill
What difference does it make who gots the most bank?
It's just ink and chlorophyll

[Chorus]
Everybody's dancing, ooh Lord
And loving you all night long
In your little world, she's your best girl
It's all money, ain't nothing wrong

You're dancing, oohee
And loving you all night long
Funky dollar bill, it's real, y'all
Easy come, easy gone

Dancing, dancing
She’s loving you all night long
In your little world, she's your best girl
Your best girl, oh, it’s my name, my name

Dancing, yes sir
Loving you all night long
Easy come, easy gone

We got this
Nah, we got this
Listen

[Outro]
Pawns aside, who's the king of two and fo’
Wit’ hot sauce from the bay to Baltimo'?
Take your woman ‘fore she hit the front do’
And whoop your whole crew 'cause they fat and slow
Short
Oh, yeah, right, exactly
That’s all you got to rhyme with that?
Let me see

Dancing, whoo
Loving you all night long
It's all money
Ain't nothing wrong
Dancing
Loving you all night long
Easy come, easy gone
Dancing
Loving you all night long
It’s all money
Ain’t nothing wrong
Dancing
Loving you all night long

[Intro]
Oh yeah
Oh, whoa
Oh-ooh
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I was born, raised on the same plantation
In the United States of the red, white and blue
Never knew that I was different
'Til Dr. King was on a balcony lyin' in a bloody pool

I expected so much more from a loving
A loving, lovin' society
A truthful explanation, you know what?
I got another, another conspiracy

[Chorus]
If it was just a dream, listen
Call me, call me a dreamer too

[Verse 2]
More rewards and accolades than anyone before or after
Twenty-first century, oh what a shame, what a shame, race, race still matters
A race to what? And where we goin'?
We in the same boat, but I'm the only one rowin'

[Chorus]
Last time I checked, you were sleepin'
But you can call me a dreamer too
Uh, what’s up with this

[Ad libs]
Yeah
Oh
Yeah
Ow
Uh

[Verse 3]
Peanut butter logic, served on a bread of lies
Don't go down too easy when you've seen your father cry
Have you ever clutched the steerin' wheel in your car too tight
Prayin' that the police sirens just pass you by that night?
While the helicopter circles us, theory's gettin' deep
Think they're sprayin' chemicals over the city while we sleep

[Chorus]
From now on I'm stayin' awake
You can call me a dreamer too

[Outro]
Oh, I got one eye open for the devils
Oh yeah, oh yeah, no
Come on! Come on!
Wake up
Please wake up
So what's it feel like?
Do you feel like?
You must be dreaming
Time to wake up
Wake up, wake up
I pledge allegiance to...

[Verse 1]
If I never get to hold your hand
If I never get to be your man
That's okay, 'cause I've got other plans
Right now, right now, oh

[Verse 2]
If I never get to kiss your lips
If I never get to feel your hips close to me
That's okay, I ain't gonna trip
Not now, no how

[Chorus]
'Cause I've got forever
Forever, oh
Eternity is just one kiss away
So they say

[Verse 2]
The opera, Jill Scott or the fair (fair)
Cyprus, if I never get to take you swimming there
If you never know how much I care, oh
I swear (I swear) Know what? It's not fair (Not fair)
No (No)

[Verse 3]
If I never get to make you laugh, ooh
If we never get to take a bubble bath
Y’see, I don't want to part with you, not tonight
If you gonna be a part of my past
I just won't, I just won't
Listen

[Chorus]
I just want forever, oh
I just want forever
Eternity is just one kiss away
What'd you say?

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Forever

[Spoken Interlude]
So many things
We can do in the new world
I can be your future lover
You can be my future girl

[Verse 4]
If I never get to see your smile
Underneath the white veil, walking up the aisle
I just might go crazy, I might go wild
So let me tell you, baby
Stop looking at me like that
Unless you want me to bite that

[Chorus]
Forever, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Forever
Eternity is just one kiss away
What you say?

Forever
Forever
A million tomorrows
Is better than one day
Forever

[Outro]
I don't want to kiss your lips
Until I get to your... hips

[Chorus 1]
Baby, here I am
By the railroad tracks
Waiting for my baby
Because he's coming back
Coming back to me
On the 503
And it won't be long
No, it won't be long

[Verse 1]
I've been so lonesome
Since the man has been gone
There isn't a thing worth mentioning
Nothing been going on

[Chorus 2]
And that's why I know
When the whistle blows
Yeah, that it won't be long
No, no, it won't be long

[Verse 2]
My daddy told me
When he said goodbye
Yes, he did
"I'll be back, baby
Baby, by and by,"
And that's why I waited
So doggone long, yeah
Can't you see how happy I am?
Because the man is coming home

[Chorus 1]
Baby, here I am
By the railroad tracks
Waiting for my baby
Because he's coming back
Coming back to me
On the 503
And it won't be long
No, it won't be long

[Verse 3]
I haven't had no loving
Since you know when
He's a long-gone rooster
And I'm a lonesome hen

[Chorus 2]
And that's why I know
When the whistle blows
Yeah, that it won't be long
No, no, it won't be long

[Bridge]
Mmm, and I'm so excited
My knees are shaking, yeah
Mr. Engineer
Don't you keep me waiting!
You hear me?
Telling you:
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!

[Chorus 1]
Baby, here I am
By the railroad tracks
Waiting for my baby
Because he's coming back
Coming back to me
On the 503
And it won't be long
No, it won't be long

[Chorus 3]
Ahh, yeah, I know
When the whistle blows
Hey, that it won't be long
No, no, it won't be long
I don't know about you, but
I know, yeah, I know
That it won't be long
No, no, it won't be long
Said it won't be long
No, it won't be long

[Verse]
Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
There's a land that I heard of
Once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dream you dare to dream
Really do come true
Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far
Behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me
Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why then, oh
Why can't I?

[Outro]
If happy little bluebirds fly
Beyond the rainbow
Why, oh Why can't I?

[Intro]
(Oh Yeah)
Yeah
Uh uh

[Verse 1]
Getting dirty at the club again
I'm usually 'round your waist like a chain but then
I got that call
So I jumped in my car

[Chorus]
I love you, baby
But not like I love my guitar
Uh huh
Not like I love my guitar
No

[Verse 2]
You couldn't do it all by yourself
You had to go and get somebody else
You're high enough to call me
But you can't reach the bar

[Chorus]
I love you, baby
But not like I love my guitar
No
Not like I love my guitar

[Ad lib]
Oh, listen, turn it up
Uh uh, yeah, now dig

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I tried to warn you that it's hard to be a star
Especially when you're driving other people's car
I would have gave you mine, girl
But you took it too far

[Chorus]
I love you, baby, huh
But just not like I love my guitar - whoo, uh uh
Not like I love my guitar
Oh

[Verse 4]
I know you love me and you want to be friends
And if you don't, at least you need to pretend
We're still together
Even if we don't get that far

[Chorus]
I love you, baby
But not like I love this guitar
I love you, baby, I love you, baby
Not like I love my guitar

[Outro]
I love you, baby, and I wish you well (I wish you well)
I'll write a letter when I learn how to spell
Until that day, you can go to... 

[laugh]
I love you, baby.... you know the rest

[Guitar Solo]
Aah aah aah

[Verse 1]
I know you are out there
I can feel your eyes on me
Seen that face a thousand times
If only in my dreams

I know you really want me
I can feel your hands on me
I really want to touch you too
In a way I'm much to shy to speak

[Chorus 1]
And even though
I'm all alone
For what it's worth
You're somewhere here on Earth
And I like it

[Verse 2]
I know you're out there
I can feel you getting closer to me
I'm just wondering what you're waiting for
You know I am free
In this digital age, you could just page me
I know it's the rage, but it just don't engage me
Like the face to face
Do you want to do this at yours, or my place?

[Chorus 2]
It's been so long
Since I been with somebody
Like a million years
Now you're here on Earth
You're here, you're here

[Modified Chorus 1]
Somewhere here on Earth
And I like it, I like it

[Verse 3]
Listen, I know you hear me
Like a whisper in your ear
You don't have to fear me
You're everything I hold so dear

I know you already love me
You're probably just too cool to say
Somebody somewhere put you down
But that's okay, that's okay

[Chorus 3]
'Cause whatever you feel
It's time to heal
No, no more hurt
As long as I'm here on Earth

[Verse 1]
I love, and you love
We love, sweet love
I look and you look
And we found sweet love
And now we know

[Chorus]
Love is the only thing that matters at all
After all

[Verse 2]
I kiss, and you kiss
Each kiss, sweet lips
I tease and you squeeze
And we find sweet bliss
That's how we know

[Chorus]
Love is the only thing that matters at all
After all

[Bridge]
I'm lucky
And you're lucky, too, uh-huh
We're lucky
And we know it's true
Love is so wonderful

[Verse 3]
I give, and you give
We live, for love
Each night, each day
We love sweet love
'Cause ain't it so?

[Outro]
Love is the only thing that matters at all
After all, y'all
Love is the only thing that matters at all
After all, y'all

[Verse 1]
I know I ain't the first to tell you
I sure bet I won't be the last
I know you're in a hurry, baby
So let me make this fast

[Chorus]
I got a lot of money
I don't want to spend it on me
I like pretty things
You're just as pretty as you can be

So if you ain't busy later
And you want some company
I ain't trying to be a hater
I'm the one, I'm the one, the one you wanna see
You wanna see
You see

[Verse 2]
Look around you, baby
You know you've seen it all before
Every nickel in this club looking for a dime
Nothing less, nothing more
Too tall to be talked down to
Too over it to be put under
Any spell a blind fisherman could cast
That's why I come like thunder to tell you

[Chorus]
I got a lot of money
But I don't want to spend it on me
I like pretty things
And you're just as pretty as you can be (oh, oh)

So if you ain't busy later
And you want some company
I ain't trying to be a hater
But I'm the one, I'm the one, the one you want to see
You want to see

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
You don't need to fix your hair
For somebody you don't care for
You don't need to shave your legs
If it ain't me that's knocking at your door, oh

I know you ain't a concubine
I know you ain't a one night stand
I don't wanna waste your time

[Bridge]
If you wanna get creamy
I'm the one you wanna see
Ooh, the one you wanna see, baby
Oh, the one you wanna see
I'm the one you wanna see

[Outro]
Coming on you like thunder
I'm the one you wanna see

[Verse 1]
Say I bet you never thought you'd find a sweet lover
You'd never find a girl like me
I say
I bet you never thought you'd find a sweet lover
You'd never find a girl like me

[Chorus]
Oh, oh
Oh yeah
Sweet lover, yeah

[Verse 2]
Ah, no matter how I treat you, baby
You like it
And I know because you told me so
I said no matter how I treat you, baby
You like it
And I know it, because you told me so

[Chorus]
Oh, oh
Oh yeah
Sweet, sweet lover, yeah

[Bridge]
Oh yeah!
I've got my hooks in you
Uh-huh
Hmm, but I guess you've got me, too

[Verse 3]
Because I never ever thought I'd find a sweet, sweet lover
I'd never find a man like you
I say I never, never ever thought I'd find a sweet sweet lover
I'd never find a man like you

[Chorus]
Oh, oh
Oh yeah
Mmm, sweet lover, yeah

[Bridge]
Oh yeah!
I've got my hooks in you
Uh-huh
Hmm, but I guess you've got me, too

[Verse 4]
Oh, oh I never, never thought I'd find a sweet lover
I'd never find a man like you
I say I never, never, never thought I'd find a sweet sweet lover
I'd never find a man like you

[Chorus]
Oh, oh
Mmm, oh yeah
Sweet, sweet lover, yeah
Oh, oh
Oh yeah
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet lover, yeah
Oh, oh
Oh, oh yeah
Sweet lover, yeah, yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
Never knew the softness of his tender kiss
Don't know if he's weak or strong
All I know is he's in every dream I dream
All night long

[Verse 2]
Mmm, never heard him speak a single word of love
Never knew his favorite song
Because he only speaks to me in dreams I dream
All night long

[Bridge]
When I'm asleep, he tells me he's in love with me
And how much he needs me to be near
But at best, a dream is just a fantasy
If I touch his hand, he'll disappear
No, no, no, no, no, no

[Verse 3]
I don't need a lover that's just a memory
Fate, how could you be so wrong?
Now I've got to find a man who's haunting me
All night long

[Outro]
All night long
All night long
All night long

[Verse 1]
If you ever need me
You know where to call me
And if you ever want me
You know where to write me
But you never call me
And no, you never write me
So, who needs you?
Who needs you?
Take a pen, a pencil
A hand, a little item
Or the telephone, dear
Why you want to fight them
How much can it cost you
Why don't you get lost, dear?
Who needs you?
Who needs you?

[Pre-Chorus]
You came on like a big deal
And all that you could beg me
Listen Mister Big Wheel
All you do is drag me

[Chorus]
When I really need you
You just can't be found, dear
And when I really want you
You're nowhere around, dear
So, all this big production
Leads to one deduction
Who needs you?
Who needs you?

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I've heard it said my lovers look alike
Could it be that I was looking for you?
They were cool, but something wasn't right
They had me fooled for a minute and then I saw the truth

[Chorus]
None of them got what it takes
To be a future baby mama
Gotta bend in the wind, but don't break
To keep your man
Show me one of them and I'll make her mine
With no more drama
Future baby mama

[Verse 2]
I've heard it said I won't treat you right
(You know that ain't right)
But they ain't sure, 'cause they don't know nothing about you
(You know you want me)
You're too secure to ever wanna fuss and fight
(That's right)
That's why your man never ever got a reason to doubt you

[Chorus]
None of them got what it takes
To be a future baby mama, hey
Gotta bend in the wind, but don't break
To keep your man, hey hey hey
Show me one of them and I'll make her mine
With no more drama
Future baby mama

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I know you might be fine, but I've seen it all before
Cinderella was a waste of time and, oops, she's out the door
To build a house together, the thing that matters more
Is under the floor
A strong foundation that lasts forever more

[Bridge]
I want to make you happy, baby (Oh, yes)
Happier than happy itself (Oh, yes)
You know what?
If you'll ever need a hand, call me I'll help
'Cause I got you, anywhere you wanna go, uh huh (Oh yes)

Paris, London, Africa, San Lucas Mexico, you see
I know what you want ( know, I know)
What every good woman wants
A man so in love with you
He can't help but to flaunt you
Deep down I know what you want
You want your girlfriends to hate you
'Cause they can't get your man

[Chorus]
None of them got what it takes
To be a future baby mama
Gotta bend in the wind, but don't break
To keep your man
Show me one of them and I'll make her mine
With no more drama
Future baby mama, well well

Future baby mama
Future baby mama
Baby mama
Baby mama

[Verse 1]
Tell me if you love me
Right now
Tell me if you want me
Right now
You make me think you like it when we kiss
But still you never say so
So if you're only playing
Let´s stop
Because you're nearly blowing my top
And if you can say you do
But if you don't
Baby, tell me right now

[Bridge]
You've got a smile I love
And you have a style I love
And your caress is all my heart is dreaming of
But if you keep stalling by the time we click
I'll be turning gray and you'll be walking with a stick

[Verse 2]
So if we're gonna make it
Let's start
Because you're overworking my heart
I confess that I'm with you
And you with me
But tell me right now

[Bridge]
You've got, you've got the smile I love
And God knows you have a style I love
And your caress is all my heart is dreaming of
But if you keep stalling by the time we click
I'll be turning gray and you'll be walking with a stick

[Outro]
So if we're going to make it
We've gotta start
Because you're overworking my heart
And you're the guy that I love
That I can't deny
And all you ever give me
Is just an alibi
And baby I've decided now it's do or die
So tell me if you love me
Oh, tell me if you love me
Oh, I want to know now
I want to know now
Yes, right now
Mmm-hmm

[Verse 1]
Just let me love you tonight
Forget about tomorrow
My darling won't you hold me tight

[Chorus]
And never let
Never let me go

[Verse 2]
Dry your eyes
No tears, no sorrow
Cling to me with all your might

[Chorus]
And never let me go

[Bridge]
A million times or more
We said we'd never never never never part
Ah but lately
Lately I find
That you're a stranger
A stranger in my heart
Give me give me give me

[Verse 3]
Give me the night
In summer or in springtime
To tell the world
That you're every bit of mine

[Outro]
And you'll never
Oh, never let me go
No, you'll never let me go

[Intro]
Mister, mister
Love you, mister
Come on

[Chorus]
Call Mr. Goodnight
He'll make you feel alright
Make you throw your head back and holla
So nice, so nice

Better not tell your girlfriend
You can try with all your might (3121)
Just can't keep a secret
About goodnight, goodnight

[Verse 1]
Hey, baby, hey baby, hey, baby, sitting all alone in my courtyard
Looking as if you have every right
All over the world they call me Prince
But you can call me Mr. Goodnight
Surely the dandies that escort you places
Imparted a rumor or two
About the parade of lovely faces
That follow me, surely they do?

What say you to that, with lips so inviting?
It's all I can do not to stare
What say you to them, past, present and future
That you don't care (I don't care)

If so, you'll be the first and I'll give you the keys
To the whip of your dreams, alright?
All over the world they call me Prince (yeah)
But you can call me Mr. Goodnight

[Chorus]
Call Mr. Goodnight
He'll make you feel alright
Make you throw your head back and holla
So nice, so nice

Better not tell your girlfriend
You can try with all your might
Just can't keep a secret
About goodnight, goodnight

[Verse 2]
Now I don't want to put to you to sleep with a bunch of chatter
And a rap that really don't matter
But now that you know who I am, you need to make plans
And all your other pennies should scatter (scatter)

A limousine about to pick you up
And then take you to a private jet (too fine) (yeah)
And then you going to meet a little Spanish man
Who will offer you wine and Moet

In an hour or two, you'll be taken to a suite
That will rival your wildest dreams
And on the bed three dresses to choose one, pick one
Then you get a call from me (ring)

Tell me which dress you chose
So I can put on, put on my matching suit
All the real guys hold your hands up
You know how Mr. Goodnight do

[Chorus]
Call Mr. Goodnight
He'll make you feel alright
Make you throw your head back and holla
So nice, so nice
Better not tell your girlfriend
You can try with all your might (3121)
Just can't keep a secret
'Bout goodnight, goodnight

[Bridge]
I love you, baby
I don't want nobody else
Call Mr Goodnight (You can call him) (any time at all)
Call Mr Goodnight (yeah, yeah, yeah) (I love you, mister)

[Verse 3]
MP3, Mike Philly in the band got jams at midnight
Before the main attraction, you see
Slow it down somewhere here on Earth
Just to check how your reaction be

And if your heartbeat goes up a notch or two
There ain't no telling what I might do
But I got a mind full of good intentions
And a mouth full of Raisinets (better not tell you)

We can watch Chocolat on the big screen
Before we convene in the pool (yeah)
The waterfall'll wash your cares away
Already I love you, I do

[Chorus]
Call Mr. Goodnight
He'll make you feel alright (Mister, mister)
Make you throw your head back and holla
So nice, so nice

Better not tell your girlfriend
You can try with all your might
Just can't keep a secret
About goodnight, goodnight

[Verse 4]
The energy in this field's been known to flicker lights, 'ight
A symphony with no rest, a capella moans and a bridge of sighs (goodnight) (call, call)
Undeterred, nevertheless, a masterpiece on butterscotch thighs (call, call)
Turn off the lights, turn off the lights
It's time for Mr. Goodnight

[Chorus 1]
Are you sure your prayers
Haven't been answered?
Now, think
Sister, think

[Verse 1]
But don't you dare
Say the good Lord
Didn't stop to hear you
He hears and sees
Everything you do
Stop right now
And take the inventory
You'll come up
With a different story

[Chorus 2]
Because He sees
Every move you make
Every wiggle of you head
Every wink of your eye
He sees
The laugh you're laughing
And hears tears you cry

[Chorus 3]
You may not know
How to pray
But He loves you
When you try
So raise your voices high
And the Lord will hear you
Hear you

[Verse 2]
He sees every move you make
Every wiggle of you head
Every wink of your eye
He sees
The laugh you're laughing
And hears tears you cry

[Chorus 1]

[x2]

[Verse 3]
Don't you dare
Say the good Lord
Didn't stop to hear you
He hears and sees
Everything you do
Stop right now
And take the inventory
You'll come up
With a different story

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

[Outro]
Oh! Raise your voices high
And the Lord will hear you
Hear you
Oh! Raise your voices high
And the Lord will hear you

[Verse]
Mmm, maybe I'm a fool
For loving you so
And maybe, maybe I'm a fool
I don't, I don't really know
Mmm, but I can't
I can't stop loving you, darling, oh yes
Though I tried, oh yes
And maybe, maybe your goodbye was so mean
So mean and unfair
Though you made me cry
My love's still there
Mhm, and I know
I know that I'll long for your kisses, oh
Until I die
Oh yes, until I die

[Bridge]
Well, I said all of my friends
All of my friends have told me
They said
"Aretha, why don't you find
You really need to find somebody new"
Yeah, oh yeah
But what they don't know
What they just don't know is in my heart
I'd missing, oh
That that someone was you
So, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Outro]
So if you should decide
If you should decide to try me once more
All you got to do
All you got to do is knock on my door
And I'll say
I'll say that I've taken you back
If taking you back would be foolish
Then maybe, oh, maybe I'm a fool
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse]
It ain't necessarily so
It ain't necessarily so
The things that you're liable
To read in the Bible
It ain't necessarily so
Now David was small but, oh my
Yes, David was small but, oh my
He fought big Goliath
Who lay, lay down and dieth
Yes, David was small
But, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa my
You've ever heard about Jonah?
He lived in a whale
You've ever heard about Jonah?
He lived, lived in a whale
And he made his home in that fish's abdomen
Yes Jonah, he lived in a whale
To get into heaven
Don't snap for a seven
Live clean and don't have no fault
And take me, yeah, take that gospel
Whenever it's possible
But with a little grain of salt
Methuselah lived 900 years
Methuselah lived 9,900 years
But tell me who, who calls that living
When no gal is given to no man
What's 900 years?

[Bridge]
That's why I say that it ain't
It ain't necessarily
It ain't, no, necessarily
It ain't, it ain't necessarily so

[Outro]
Ain't necessarily so
Ain't necessarily so
Ain't necessarily
Ain't necessarily
Ain't necessarily

[Verse 1]
Because I turned my eye toward you
Because I seek your hand
Every other woman envies you
And me, every other man

A massive circle of jealousy
Is coming 'round again
Those prickly fingered scalawags
That masquerade as friends

[Verse 2]
Make a promise this very night
That they will no longer pose
A threat to either one of us
Then let the chapter close

For all the midnights in the world
This one will serve us better
If you choose to be my girl

[Verse 3]
Like Zuzu's petals
A wonderful life, the two of us shall lead
The children of the future've all the
Spiritual food they need
The secrets that the ones before
With grace, they've come and shown
Together with love for one another
We shall make them known

[Verse 4]
With the love and happy days
I number the grains of sand
Writing twelve times ever more
If I could be your man
Amethyst and rubies
Crystals and black pearls
I trade them all, just to spend with you
All the midnights in the world
All the midnights in the world

[Verse 1]
You made me love you
I didn't wanna do it
Didn't wanna do it
You made me love you
And all the time you knew it
I guess you always knew it

[Bridge]
You made me happy sometimes
Oh,and you made me glad
Ah, but there were, there were times, dear
That you made me feel so bad, oh oh

[Verse 2]
Now, you, you made me sigh for
I didn't wanna tell ya
Just couldn't find it in my heart to tell ya
I want, I want a love that's true
You know I do, oh yes I do, indeed, I do
Ah yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Now, give me, give me, give me
Ah, give me what I cry for
'Cause you know you got the kind of kisses
Oh, that I'd lay down and die for, yeah
Now, you know, you know you made me, oh, love you

[Intro]
A model... Used to be a role model
I dunno
Come on, Chelsea!
I dunno
Come on (Uh-huh)
Ah, go ahead now, Chelsea! Go ahead now!
This for Jersey right here
Go ahead now!
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)

[Chorus]
Chelsea Rodgers was a model
Though she really rocked the role, yes, she did
Kept her tears up in her, bottled
Poured them out to save your soul

[Verse 1]
Ask her what she liked the most
She said, she liked to talk to Jimi's ghost, ow
Fantasy or bragger's boast (This girl is fly)
Chelsea's fly, like coast to coast (Mmm)
Hollywood or Times Square
If the party's fly, my girl is there (yes, she is)
Earth boots on and flowers in her hair
21st Century hippy, Chelsea don't care

[Chorus]
Chelsea Rodgers was a model
Thought she really rocked her role, yes, she did
Kept her tears up in a bottle
Poured them out to save her soul

[Verse 2]
Try to catch her if you can (Come on now together)
But you never see her with one man (Uh, a brother got to jump in the water)
He must be baptized, according to the master plan
Before she give up the good thang
Go ahead, Chelsea! (Go ahead, Chelsea!)

No cut diamonds, and designer shoes (Uh, no-no)
'Cause she's too original from her head down to her feet
(Rehab) (If you want to) Chelsea don't eat no meat
Still got butt like a leather seat
Go ahead, Chelsea! (Go ahead, Chelsea!)

[Chorus]
Chelsea Rodgers was a model
Plus she really rocked her role, yes, she did
She kept her tears up in a bottle
Poured them out to save a soul

[Bridge]
Go ahead, Chelsea!
(Speak on it horns)
Come on

[Verse 3]
Next to her they just a fool
Chelsea read more books than a few
Moses was a Pharaoh in the 18th Dynasty
And Mo' was chilling in Carthage in 33 BCE
And the day that we stop counting, we live as long as a tree
Go ahead, Chelsea, teach me! Go ahead, Chelsea

Make a promise to your higher self
And get true knowledge then fame and wealth
You don't be chasing nobody's ghost
Of everything, make the most (Come on)

[Chorus]
Chelsea Rodgers was a model
Thought she really rocked her role
Kept her tears up in her, bottled, yes, she did
Poured them out to save your soul

[Chorus]
Chelsea Rodgers was a model
Thought she really rocked her role, yes, she did
Kept her tears up in her, bottled
Poured them out to save your soul

[Interlude]
Shake it like a Juicy Juice
Shake it like a Juicy Juice
Shake it like a Juicy Juice
Shake it like a Juicy Juice

[Chorus]
Chelsea Rodgers was a model
Thought she really rocked the role
Kept her tears up in her, bottled
Poured them out to save her soul

Chelsea Rodgers was a model
Poured them out to save her soul

[Verse]
I hate to say, I told you so
Though you deserve it, because you know
You left me crying, for someone new
But all the heartache, came back to you
Now you’re begging me to take you back
I told you so, I told you so

[Verse]
When you were king and riding high
You thought your new love would never die
While you were laughing, I cried alone
You wouldn't even, throw me a bone
Now you’re begging me to take you back
I told you so, I told you so

[Bridge]
The things you sew, I know you should have reap
I told you so, I told you so
You outta learn to look before you leap
I told you so, I told you so
You can’t win when you’re a jumping jack
I told you so, I told you so

[Verse]
I hate to say, I told you so
But listen closely, I'll say it slow
When you were leaving, I told you then
You needn't ever, come back again
So let me tell you with a last goodbye
I told you so, I told you so
So let me, let me, tell you with a last goodbye
I told you so, I told you so

[Verse]
I've looked around, all over town
And I'm so lonely, and so blue
I've looked around and all over
But I can't find nobody like you, you, you, yeah
Now, it's all so lonely, since you went away
And I don't know what to do
I've looked around all over, over
I just can't find nobody, nobody like you

[Bridge]
Tears seem to fall when I'm away, oh, when I'm away from you
And I've tried to understand the reason why
And now I know it's all, it's all because I love you, I love you so much
My heart is yours until the day that I die

[Outro]
And oh, why don't you hold me
Hold me and never, never let me go?
Why don't you, why don't you love me, love me
And vanish all thoughts of sorrow?
I love you, I love you, just can't find nobody like you

[Verse 1]
Sitting on the floor of an all-white room
Feeling like the color blue
Thinking about the words that I can use
To get this through to you

A million mistakes and then some
I've made with the ones before
I've probably passed my expiration date
But still I adore you
Adore you

Looking for the energy to take you there
The places that you wanna go
Knowing if I do, you're fully aware
The press will turn it in to a show (A show)

Everyone expects this outcome
But still they jump for all the crew
I guess I should be happy, but I'm still not
Sure that you really love me
(Love me, love me, love me) You love me

[Chorus]
Like the Lion of Judah (Judah)
I strike my enemies down
As my God is living
Surely the trumpet will sound

There was one who would stand by my side
Through the good and the bad
Let that one stand with pride
The best that I've ever had
Like the Lion of Judah

[Verse 2]
Driving away with a smile on my face
Wind blowing through my hair
Wondering how you'll feel when you find out
How much I really care (I care)

Hoping that the tears roll down your face (Down your face)
Your body grasps who we are (Who are we?)
Two gypsy beggars who only by Vegas
Came to be a star
(A super star) A star
That's what we are

[Chorus]
Like the Lion of Judah (Judah)
I strike my enemies down
As my God is living
Surely the trumpet will sound
Lion of Judah
Lion of Judah

[Guitar solo]

[Outro]
Like the Lion of Judah (Judah)
I strike my enemies down
Like the Lion of Judah (Judah)
Surely you, going to hear the trumpet sound
Hear the trumpet will sound (oh)
Lion... Judah... Judah
The Lion of Judah

[Verse 1]
I know why I've waited
I know why I've been blue, yeah
'Cause I've been waiting here for somebody, baby
Ah, yeah, exactly like you, uh-huh
Why should we spend all of our money
On a show or two
When nobody makes those love scenes, honey
Ah, exactly like you

[Bridge]
Now you make me feel so grand
I wanna give this world to you
And you make me understand
These foolish little dreams I'm dreaming
And schemes I'm scheming, yeah

[Verse 2]
I know why my daddy
Taught me to be true, yeah
'Cause he was keeping me here for somebody, somebody, somebody
Exactly like you

[Bridge]
Now you make me feel so grand
I wanna hand this great big wide world to you
And you make me understand
That these foolish little dreams I'm dreaming
And oh, schemes I'm scheming, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
I know why my daddy, yeah
The man taught me to be true, uh-huh
'Cause he was saving me here for somebody, somebody, somebody
Exactly like you
Oh, exactly, ah baby
Like you
Exactly like you
Nobody, nobody, nobody but you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Exactly, exactly, exactly, oh, like you
Oh baby
Somebody, somebody like you

[Verse 1]
It’s so heartbreaking when the one you love
Is in love with somebody else
When somebody you’ve been dreaming of
Is in love with somebody else
You can’t keep on smiling over rainy’s due
Keep on walking though you have got to hold in your shoe

[Chorus]
But it’s so heartbreaking when the one you love
Is in love with somebody else

[Verse 2]
John thought Jennie really love him true
Till he caught her kissing with Bill
John is so lonesome, don’t know what he’ll do
Since Jane went over the hills
So there goes Johnnie with a broken heart
He is just too good for nothing since they’re apart

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Oh, it’s so heartbreaking when you’re love is gone
And your dream love go up in smoke
And it’s so frightening, baby, when you love someone
And he thinks your love is a joke
Oh, you got to keep on living till the day you die
But you’re so disgusted that you wonder why

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
I said that it’s so heartbreaking when the one you love
Is in love with somebody else
It hurts so bad, yes it does
So heartbreaking when the one you love
Is in love with somebody else
That man really turn just back on
So heartbreaking when the one you love
Is in love with somebody else

[Intro]
Now, listen here, girls
I’m going to tell you what I want right now

[Verse 1]
I want a rough lover
I want a man
I want a rough, tough lover
And I’ll find him if I can
He’s got to bite nails
Fight bears
And if I get sassy
Be a man who dares
To shut me up and kiss me so I know he cares
I want a man

[Verse 2]
Don’t want a mean daddy
I want a boss
I want a mean, sweet daddy
Who the devil wouldn't cross
He’s got to spit fire
Chew iron
Get mad and start roaring like a mountain lion
Then whisper that he loves me so I know he’s mine
I want a man

[Bridge]
I’m looking for a guy who’s brave and strong
But weak for me
I’m looking for a guy who’ll ride around
But never, never set me free

[Verse 3]
I want a rough lover
I want a man
I want a rough, tough lover
With a sentimental plan
So he can kiss nice
Hug tight
He’s got to be sweet and gentle
Day and night
But mean enough to make me wanna to treat him right
I want a man, oh yeah

[Bridge]
I’m looking for a guy who’s brave and strong
But weak for me
I’m looking for a guy who’ll ride around
But never, never set me free

[Verse 4]
I want a rough lover
I want a man
I want a rough, tough lover
With a sentimental plan
So he can kiss nice
Hug tight
He’s got to be sweet and gentle
Day and night
But mean enough to make me wanna to treat him right
I want a man

[Outro]
I want a man
I don’t want no cream puff, baby
I don’t want no butterfly
I want a man
Oh, yes, I do
Oh, yes, I do

[Intro]
Come with it
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ahh)

[Verse 1]
The main problem with war
Is that nobody ever wins
The next generation grows up
And learns how to do it all over again
No matter who started the argument
Just matters how each one ends
How many people really want resolution?

[Verse 2]
The main problem with people
Is they never do what they say (They say)
One minute they want peace (Want peace)
Then do everything to make it go away
Dropping bombs on each other
In the act of saving face
Tell me now, people, how is that resolution?

[Chorus]
Either you do or you don't
Either you will or you won't
Making amends (Make amends)
Is a difficult pill to swallow

[Verse 3]
What can we lose if we try?
With no water, a flower dies
With no one to lead, resolution will follow (Ohh, yes it will)
Resolution

[Bridge]
Love is like a circle
No beginning and no end
A broken heart will mend
If you love it like your best friend

Handle your heart with care
It's as delicate as the wind
When the storms come again
Pray for resolution

[Chorus]
Either you do or you don't
Either you will or you won't
Making amends (Make amends)
Is a difficult pill to swallow

[Outro]
Will you want resolution?
(Either you do or you don't)
Come on, everybody
All over the world (La, la, la, la, la)
All over the world (Do, do, do, do, do)
Tell me
How many people really want resolution?

[Intro]
Wooo!

[Chorus]
It don't matter who you get with
'Cause it just ain't meant to be
It really don't matter
'Cause you never shoulda woulda
Ever coulda been like me

I can get you what you want
Anything at all, girl, all you got to say is "please"
Ask your mother, your sister, your brother
There will never be another
Never be another like me

[Verse 1]
Late afternoon slipped outta my bed
Turned up the stereo, about to raise the dead
Slipped in the bathroom, put some olive oil in my hair
Walked in the closet, trying to find something to wear
Then I check my email, see where the party be
Change the names to protect the guilty and get ready to creep
Should I bring somebody or dance alone?
It don't matter to me, y'all, 'cause tonight it's on, c'mon

[Chorus]
It really don't matter who you get with
'Cause it just ain't meant to be
It really don't matter
'Cause you never shoulda woulda
Ever coulda been like me (Baby)

I can get you what you want
Anything at all, girl, all you got to say is "please"
Ask your mother, your sister, your brother
There will never be another
Never be another like me

[Verse 2]
'Bout a half past ten and I'm on my way
Heard you had a fine little Puerto Rican DJ
(Oh Mamacita)
Listen, if she ain't got Prince's new song, gonna be a scene
'Cause I can't stand nobody cussing at me when I'm clean

Arms all around me soon as I hit the door
Good thing I ate my spinach, you're thicker than before
Oh, what's this boy looking at? Why he making that face?
Don't he know I got crazy fools with me
Ready to tear up this place?

[Chorus]
It really don't matter who you get with
'Cause it just ain't meant to be
(Be like Don Cornelius or Rick James)
It really don't matter
'Cause you never shoulda woulda
Ever coulda been like me

I can get you what you want
Anything at all, girl, all you got to say is "please" (oh Lord)
Ask your mother, your sister, your brother
There will never be another
Never be another like me

[Bridge]
Can't you see this is inevitable?
What's the use in wasting time, mama?
You and me, we could be comfortable
All it takes is you to make up your mind

[Interlude]
Uh, so now what's the matter, huh?
You and me, we both dimes, said we were
All them other pennies should scatter, said they should
We ought not waste this time, that's why

[Chorus]
It really don't matter who you get with
'Cause it just ain't meant to be
It really don't matter (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause you never shoulda woulda
Ever coulda been like me

I can get you what you want
Anything at all, girl, all you got to say is "please"
(You gotta stop being average, it doesn't last)
Ask your mother, your sister, your brother
There will never be another
Never be another like me (What you waiting for?)

[Interlude]
What you waiting for, what you waiting for?
(Never be another like me)
So what you thicker than before?
That's a'ight
(What you waiting for, what you waiting for?)
I like 'em healthy, baby, and what's more
(Never be another like me)
Let's get out on this dance floor
Whoo!

[Chorus]
It really don't matter who you get with
'Cause it just ain't meant to be
Never be another, never be another like me
I can get you what you want
Anything at all, girl, all you got to say is "please"
Never be another, never be another like me
Never be another, never be another like me

Never be another like me
Never be another like me
Never be another, never be another like me

[Outro]
What you waiting for? What you waiting for?
What you waiting for? What you waiting for?
What you waiting for? What you waiting for?
What you waiting for? What you waiting for?
Never be another, never be another
Never be another, never be another like me

[Verse 1]
Up in the morning, out on the job
Work like the devil for my pay
While that lucky old sun's got nothing to do
But roll, roll around heaven all day

[Verse 2]
Now, I've got to, work for my family, and toil for my kids
Sweat until I'm wrinkled and gray, gray
While that lucky old sun's got nothing to do
But roll around heaven all day

[Bridge]
Good Lord up above, don't you know I'm pining?
Tears all in, all in my eyes
Send down Your cloud with a silver lining
And lift me to paradise, oh

[Verse 3]
Show me, show me that river, and take me across
And wash all of my troubles, wash them away
While that lucky old sun ain't got nothing to do
But roll around Your heaven all day

[Bridge]
Now, good Lord, dear Lord
Can't you see, can't you see that I'm trying?
Tears all in, all in my eyes
Now send down Your cloud with a silver lining
And lift me, lift me to paradise, and oh yeah

[Verse 4]
Show me, show me that river, and Lord, take me across
And I wonder will You wash all of my troubles, Lord, wash them away
While that lucky old sun's got nothing to do
But roll, roll around heaven all day

[Outro]
That lucky old sun ain't got nothing to do
But roll, roll, roll around heaven all day, yeah

[Verse 1]
Nevermind the bird feed honey, just tell me your name
You won't have that long if I get my way in this game
My reputation precedes me, call it claim to fame
They know me around the world, you want me just the same
Why should you be satisfied with just heaven and earth?
When you look around there's so much more to the universe
Maybe every shining star is just another part
If you and I could ever open up our dirty hearts

[Ad libs]
Oh, open up
Oh yeah
Listen

[Verse 2]
All of us in minerals and chemicals of space
You carry within your womb, that's how we got to this place
This might seem a bit serious, but if it turns you on
Come with me now let's get nice 'til serious is gone
Why should you be satisfied with just heaven and earth?
When you look around there's so much more to the universe
Maybe every shining star is just another part
If you and I could ever open up our dirty hearts

[Ad libs]
Oh c'mon
Get nice

[Verse 3]
Love is much too small a word for what you feel for me
If you ever let me explore your anatomy
You and I lost in each other: prisoners yet free
Come on darling let's get to the beginning endlessly

[Ad libs]
Let's get down
Beginning endlessly
Let's get down
Come on
Oooh wee
Come on
Can't you see that I wantcha?
Come on
Can't you see that I wantcha?

[Verse 3]
History is full of praise for another's history
More and more than the one that became before both you and me
Left alone with our devices, whatever will be will be
A brand new story in the making beginning endlessly

[Outro]
Love is much to small a word,for what you feel for me
If ever you you let me be, let me be your man
Ooh baby!
Understand
I want to
I want to be your man
Get on down, come on
Beginning endlessly

[Verse 1]
We played the game of stay away
But it cost more than I can pay
Without you I can’t make my way
I surrender, dear

[Verse 2]
Now, I may seem proud, and I may act gay
But it’s just a pose, oh, I’m not that way
Because deep down, deep down in my heart, I say
I surrender, dear

[Bridge]
Mmm, little mean things we were doing
Must have been part of the game
And lending a spice to the wooing
Oh, but I don’t care who’s to blame, blame

[Verse 3]
When stars appear and shadows fall
Why then you’ll hear my poor heart call?
To you my love, my life, my all
I surrender, dear

[Outro]
Oh, I, I surrender, dear
Oh, yeah, yeah, I
Oh, I surrender, yeah, dear, yeah, yeah

[Intro: Prince and Q-Tip]
I got a box o' chocolates that'll rock the socks
Off any girl that want to come my way

[Verse 1: Prince]
So, what's the deal, yo, you fronting keep it real
Do you want to get funky with me?
If you think I got something that you want
Sugar, nothing here comes for free

Let me see if you remember my name
You can try to get it, but I can't let you hit it
'Cause you never going to be the same, uh uh

[Chorus: Prince]
I got a box o' chocolates that'll rock the socks

And I ain't got no time to waste if she ain't making bank
And scared of what a brother got to say

[Refrain: Prince]
She want the b-o-x o' chocolate everyday

[Verse 2: Prince]
So what's the deal? Are you sporting some wheels
Or are you riding in a limousine?
This ain't prom night and I don't wanna fight
So you better get your dirty clean, uh

You're gonna get a chance to prove it
You best believe if you want to get with me
It takes a real woman to do it, uh huh

[Chorus: Prince]

She want the b-o-x o' chocolate everyday

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
How can I make you mine, if I had the sweetest kind
I can sugar brush you in my arms, you're my love divine
I'm your Willy Wonka, golden ticket is yours
Don't you waste, not one taste, from my ladle it pours
They say the sweetness you’ll eat up, but the bitter is betta
Takin' bites from the box, you never know what you getta
But you keep trying and trying, 'cause the flavor is fun
So many variations from the contents of one
Where the drums?

[Verse 4: Prince]
So what's the deal? Are you gay or popping pills?
Why you still wanna take my hand?
This discotheque is about to make me a wreck
My feet are singing louder than the band

I see you got the feeling, flashing lights up on the ceiling
Say you gotta get your weekend now
What difference does it make?
You know you can't make chocolate cake
If ain't nobody ever showed you how

[Chorus: Prince]
I got a box o' chocolates that'll rock the socks
Off any girl that wanna come my way
And I ain't got no time to waste if she ain't making bank
And scared of what a brother got to say

I got a box o' chocolates that'll rock the socks
Off any girl that wanna come my way
And I ain't got no time to waste if she ain't making bank
And scared of what a brother got to say

[Refrain: Prince]
She want the b-o-x o' chocolate everyday

[Outro: Prince]

Girl that want to come my way

[Intro]
Gather around me, everybody
Gather around me, while I preach some

[Verse 1]
The topic will be sin
And that's what I'm aging
If you want to hear my story
Then settle back and just sit tight
While I start reviewing
The attitude of doing right

[Chorus]
You got to ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive
E-lim-i-nate the negative
And latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with mister in between

[Verse 2]
You got to spread joy up to the maximum
Bring gloom down to the minimum
And have faith, or pandemonium
Liable to walk upon the scene
To illustrate my last remark
Jonah in the whale, noah in the ark
What did they do, just when everything looked so dark?
Man, they said, we better

[Chorus]
You got to ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive
E-lim-i-nate the negative
And latch on to the affirmative
Don't mess with mister in between

[Intro]
Well, all right

[Verse 1]
I had a dream last night
That I was flying for the first time
And in the dream I could pilot my flight
With the thoughts in my mind
Since there wasn't any up or down
Everybody was all around
When we sang, we all sang together
Oh, what a beautiful sound

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, sha la la la la
This is the future soul song
Ooh, ooh, sha la la la la
This is the future soul song

[Verse 2]
I had a dream last night that I was singing
And the sound of my voice
Seemed to come from every mountain top like it had no choice
And when my voice rose, so did the sun
When the trees sang the harmony as one
Every living soul sang the most beautiful melody ever sung

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, sha la la la la
This is the future soul song
Ooh, ooh, sha la la la la
This is the future soul song

[Verse 3]
Before the war the only words and language said
Let there be light
Those that can see it are the ones who believe it
And put up no fight
And in the absence of fear and control
Is the sound of the surrendering soul
Louder than the dogmatic persecution
I sing it like you got that right

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, sha la la la la
This is the future soul song
Ooh, ooh, sha la la la la
This is the future soul song

[Outro]
Listen to me now
I hear sighs, I hear whispers
Ooh, ooh, sha la la la la
This is between me and my Lord
You can go right on ahead and stare
'Cause never was and never will there be
Ooh, ooh, sha la la la la
Any little shame in my tree
You should do you, guess what
This is the future soul song
And let me do me

[Intro]
I like it when you dance for me, hallelujah
Oh, funky congregation
Let us bow our heads in prayer
(You)
And thank the Almighty for you, baby
(Thank you, thank you)
Glory, glory, hallelujah
I like it, I like it
I like it when you dance for me

[Verse 1]
I like it when you dance 'cause it gets me hot
I like it when you shake everything you got
I like it when you dance 'cause it's so sexy
I like it when you dance for me

I like it when you think I'm all alone
You're the voice I hear on the telephone
Telling me all your deepest fantasies
I like it when you dance for me, hallelujah

[Chorus]
I like it when you dance for me
I like it when you dance for me

[Verse 2]
I like it when I hear a knock on my door
You are standing there in your Christian Dior
Dark sunglasses in the pale moonlight
I like it when the scene is right (Oh oh)

You can take your wrap and lay it on the chair
If anybody finds it, I don't care
What we do together makes history
I like it when you dance for me, hallelujah

[Chorus]
Oh oh, I like it when you dance for me
Oh, I like it when you dance for me

Dance, dance, dance. dance for me
Dance, dance
I like it when you dance for me

[Verse 3]
Your flamenco eyes are all like jazz
With every other sip of what's in your glass
The sexier you get
The more you into my stash
I like it when you dance for me
Hallelujah
I like it when you
Dance for me
I like it when you dance for me

[Bridge]
You don’t need directions, and you don’t need cash
From your Jimmy Choo’s to your ultra lash
Least that I can do, baby, is get half
It’s worth it when you dance for me!
Hallelujah

Now dance
Dance for me
Now dance
Dance for me

[Verse 4]
I like it when you dance 'cause it gets me hot
I like it when you shake everything you got
I like it when you dance 'cause it's so sexy
I like it when you dance for me
(Say it again)
I like it when you dance 'cause it gets me hot
I like it when you shake everything you got
I like it when you dance 'cause it's so sexy
I like it when you dance for me
Hallelujah
Oh lady, shake it now
Make me wanna (I like it when you dance for me)
Make me wanna pick up maracas and just shake
I like it when you dance for me
I like it when you dance for me

[Outro]
Dance
Dance
I like it when you dance for me
I like it when you dance for me

[Verse 1]
Wheels go down
About to land and another dream of you
All night long
Out of town
I had to go but now I need a cup of something
Black and strong
Beside me
I was used to waking up with you here
Now you're gone
Why oh why
Didn't you hurry along with me this time?
Right or wrong

[Chorus 1]
As a matter of fact, I can't stop thinking about you, babe
When we're together, everything is cool
Beautiful lover, friend, I'll never leave you again
You and me, we're sticky like glue

[Verse 2]
Bright blue eyes
Staring down into mine saying
"Good morning, how are you?"
I can't lie
Waking up in a plane without a warning
Ain't too cool
Cast ashore
Without a paddle and no more excuses
We just drown
What's the score?
If you still really want to be my Muse then
Come around

[Chorus 2]
As a matter of fact I just can't live without you, babe
I'm wondering if you feel the same way too
I'm hugging this pillow tight
The way we did last night
The sweat of each other, sticky like glue

[Verse 3]
Sticky, sticky, 1, 2
That was the coolest movie ever
The one we saw last night
The closer you got to me
The less we saw, alright
The scene you remember the most is none of 'em
That ain't a boast, girl
I'm just in front of them others, I am a gracious host
Everybody under me, make a toast

[Chorus 1]
As a matter of fact, I can't stop thinking about you, babe
Sexiest man alive
When we're together, everything is cool
People Magazine ain't even in the top five
Beautiful lover, friend, I'll never leave you again
You and me, we're sticky
You and me, we're sticky
Sticky sticky
You and me, we're sticky like glue

[Breakdown]
Breakdown
Uh, get it
Oh, sticky like glue
All right that's the part
I got something I want to say to you, babe
You might want to dig me later
I think you better dig me now
Listen
I can't get to sleep unless your body
Unless your body is right here next to me
It's crazy baby, I know we're dysfunctional
But I, I, I, I just can't, can't see myself
Myself with another, girl
Oh, what in the world is wrong with me?
I don't know what's wrong with me, babe
Tell me what to do, is it me or you?
We fight so much and then we're through
It might come as a shock to you
But I, I, I, I, I still love you, yes, I do
Sticky like glue, sticky, sticky
Don't you think I ain't when I am?
One more thing and then I'm out
You get us wet with your pride
Then you hang us both outside to cry, cry
What's that sound?
Sticky like glue
Said it must be raining, raining tears, tears, tears
But you need to dry your eyes
Sticky like glue
Please, please, please don't cry
Cause we ain't, I ain't, going nowhere, no
Somebody needs to tell that girl
One more time, now
Sticky like glue

[Intro]
Act, Act of God, act, act

[Verse 1]
Dirty fat banker sold a house today
Sold at auction wants the family out the way
Kick them on the street, cause he couldn't pay the tax
Call it an act of God
(Act of God)

[Verse 2]
I get a million dollars people hear me sang
Got to give the banker half of everything
(Half of everything)
Didn't the founding fathers holler about the same thing?
(Yes they did)
Call it an Act of God

[Chorus]
But I got news for you
Freedom ain't free
They lock you in a cell if you try to be
But the ones who say "no," make history
Call it an Act of God
(Act of God)

[Verse 3]
Tax dollars build a plane drop a bomb
Supposedly to keep us all safe from Saddam
Bringing bad news to another woman
Call it an Act of God
(Act of God)

[Chorus]
But I got news for you
Freedom ain't free
They lock you in a cell if you try to be
But the ones who say "no" make history
Call it an Act of God
(Act of God)

[Bridge]
Funny how nobody's holy books are the same
Everybody's God got a different name
The day that it's over is the end of the game
And they call it an Act of God

[Chorus]
Hey, it will be all over
When the people are free
Free to be who and what they want to be
Wherever we go it's up to you and me
Call it an Act of God
(Act of God)

[Verse 4]
We so tired said we through with fear
There never was no hell or boogie man here
If he was seen, look; he was in your mirror
Call it an act of God

[Outro]
Call it what you want except an Act of God
Call it what you want except an Act of God
Call it what you want except an Act of God
Call it an act of God
Oh Lord
Call it what you want except an Act of God
Call it what you want except an Act of God
Call it what you want except an Act of God
Call it what you want except an Act of God
Call it what you want except an Act of God

[Verse 1]
Take me to the vineyards of Lavaux
Want to see the mountains where the waters flow
Life back home depresses me, just another form of slavery
The cost of freedom is anything but free

[Verse 2]
I don't care if they are covered with snow
I don't care if the road is narrow, if it is I'll know
It was always meant to be, still in love I must believe
Whatever path I choose will lead me home

[Interlude]
Lead me home
Lavaux

[Verse 3]
Take me to the streets of Portugal
That might be my destiny to see the waterfall
Tears or rain, they're all the same
The only way to win this game
To let everybody play and share the ball

[Verse 4]
Ain't nobody got no chains on me
They got no chains on me
I'm flying higher than any mountain, deeper than any sea
A paradox is box's key, I'm the why in mystery
And you're gonna unlock the secrets if you please

[Bridge]
Come take me to an assembly in New York
To speak of the brand new everlasting wonder war
To win or lose is so absurd
And the only casualties the word
The word

[Verse 5]
Revolution time has come today
I say it took a black face to see the same decay
Like the chocolate of Vevey, in the sun they'll melt away
As for me, I'll laugh and go to the mountains where the waters flow
Back to the vineyards of Lavaux

[Outro]
Lavaux
Lavaux
Lavaux
Lavaux

[Verse 1]
After a long journey, the final mile
Wish that we walk together all the while
After a mild labor, we both smile
All of the battles that we lost, both of us in denial

[Chorus]
'Cause nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
Nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
'Cause nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
Nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you

[Verse 2]
Another sun is rising
To bed with no delay
The both of us go despising
Not enough time to play
Memories come and then they go
Somewhere far away
Why can't we just get lost together
And spend each and every day doing it?

[Chorus]
'Cause nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
Nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
'Cause nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
Nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you

[Verse 3]
We have danced with royalty
And pimps of the like
You can't please everybody
But such is life
If there was only one thing
In this world that were true
Nothing is better in this world
Than to walk in sand with you

[Chorus]
'Cause nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
Nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
'Cause nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
Nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
'Cause nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
Nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
'Cause nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
Nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
'Cause nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
Nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
'Cause nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
Nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
'Cause nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
Nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
'Cause nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
Nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you

[Intro]
Oooh baby
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I see your picture wherever I go
I'm not here to lecture, just letting you know
I know you're busy, the world's calling you
If you don't answer what will you do?

[Chorus]
You wander the wilderness
Searching for a king
Will you settle for a prince
And a sea of everything?

[Verse 2]
I read your letter, every word
No one writes better, at least none that I've heard
You sound so happy or is this a charade?
Will you still feel the same when the spotlight fades?

[Chorus]
Will you wander the wilderness
Searching for a king
Will you settle for a prince
And a sea of everything?

[Verse 3]
You and me are like two ships passing
Never reaching shore
If we ever, ooh, if we ever did
We'd just want more

[Verse 4]
No reason to care what people say
For the keys are so far, so far, so far away
No need to say, no need
To say I'd die without you, without you
Because I made, I made, what will you do?

[Chorus]
You wander the wilderness
Searching for a king
Will you settle for this
And a sea of everything?
Will you wander the wilderness
Searching for a king
Will you settle for this
And a sea of everything?

[Intro]
Ooh, oh, yeah
Oooh, Lord
(Here)

[Verse 1]
How beautiful are you?
There's more than a thousand replies
Could it be your lips or your golden eyes?

[Verse 2]
When I think of an answer
That's when I get so surprised
Another wonder of the world, realized
That's why

[Chorus]
I just don't want you here
I just don't want you near me, baby, no
'Cause I'm scared I'll cry and love you like crazy
Flying above all fears
I haven't seen any tears, not lately
(No, no)
I don't want to land, not even maybe

[Verse 3]
How desperate am I?
I wonder if you are what keeps me alive
Alone I can't get as high, even though I've tried
Oh

[Verse 4]
It's different when you're grown
The wine don't taste the same when you're alone
The size of the bed now seems like the biggest that I've ever known
Oh

[Chorus]
I just don't want you here
I just don't want you near me, baby, oh no
'Cause I'm scared I'll cry and love you like crazy
But I'm flying above all fears
(So high)
I haven't seen any tears, not lately
(No, no)
I don't want to land not even maybe

[Bridge]
There's so much more for you and me to explore
Ooh baby baby
When you walk through that door
I am gonna give you what you waited for

[Spoken Interlude]
Listen baby, let me break this down
I am going to say this once
Then I am going to leave this town
If you can learn to open your eyes under water
Then you and me won't drown without each other
I promise I'll see you on the other side
If you just believe in me and trust this ride
The quickest way, baby
You and me, sincere
Right now, I just don't want you here
(I don't, here, I don't, here, I don't want...)
I just want you here
(don't make me want you)

[Chorus]
I just want you here
I just want you near me, baby
I'm scared I'll cry and love you like crazy
I'm flying above all fears
(So high)
I haven't seen any tears, not lately, no
I don't want to land, not even maybe
Here

[Outro]
Don't listen to me, no
I just need you here
Oh, Lord
I just want you here
I just want you, want you here
Donny Hathaway's "Song For You" ain't the same without you
Here

[Verse 1]
Tonight I love everybody
Everybody loves me
The beat you're giving is the rhythm of life
Everybody get happy
If you really come to party
This is the place to be
Tonight I love everybody
Everybody loves me

[Chorus]
Everybody loves me
Everybody loves me
Everybody loves me

[Verse 2]
Tonight the stars are out
There's music in the air
The sounds of joy and celebration
Are drowning out despair
If you're the king of hate
Or if you're the queen of misery
Tonight I love everybody
Everybody loves me

[Chorus]
Everybody loves me
Everybody loves me
Everybody loves me

[Verse 3]
This party's sick
We're gonna rock this whole town
Get the police quick
Don't let them shut us down

[Ad lib]
Don't do it
No
Rock it

[Verse 4]
Tonight I love everybody
That's right, everyone
I don't care what you came here for
As long as you have fun

[Chorus]
Everybody get free
Everybody get free
Everybody get free
Everybody love me

[Verse 5]
There ain't no shame
In having a good time
There's only us to blame
If we make it up right
Oh, I ain't lying

[Refrain]
There ain't nothing to it
But to do it
There ain't nothing to it
But to do it

[Bridge]
Shake it like you don't know better
Woop de woop
Shake it like you don't know better
Woop de woop

[Refrain]
There ain't nothing to it
But to do it

[Chorus]
Everybody loves me
Everybody loves me
Everybody loves me
Everybody loves me
Everybody loves me
Everybody loves me

[Refrain]
There ain't nothing to it
But to do it
There ain't nothing to it
But to do it
There ain't nothing to it
But to do it

[Outro]
Tonight I love everybody
Everybody loves me
Tonight I love everybody
Everybody loves me
Tonight I love everybody
Everybody loves me

Everybody loves me

[Verse 1]
Oooh, they tell me that into each life
Some rain has sure got to fall
Oooh, they tell me here, that everybody
Has sure, has sure got to cry sometime (cry
And, oh, if some rain (some rain
If some rain has got to fall (some rain
On everybody, and I’ve had enough rain in my life
Then I’m so glad right now
I got a little love around me
To keep the rain off my head, yeah, yeah
And I believe it’s, I believe it’s
I believe it’s because (tell me what do you believe

On the other night, as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you, I held you in my arms, yeah
But when I woke up and found out I was mistaken, yeah
You know that I hung my (you know that I hung my
Hung my head and I cried (head and I cried

And you’ll never, never, never know, ah, how much I need you
I don’t want you to take my (oh baby, don’t you take my
Take my sunshine away (shining away

[Verse 2]
You told me once, you did it, that you really loved me
And no one else could ever, could ever come between, yeah
But now you’re thinking about to leaving me (leaving
For another, yeah (leaving
If you do you know you’re going to shatter
Shatter every one of my dreams (all of my dreams

[Chorus]

[x2]

[Chorus]
Hey, Valentina, tell your mama
She should give me a call
When she get tired of running
After you down the hall

[Verse 1]
Before you came onto the scene
It was a Hollywood mess
(Hey, Valentina)
Your mama was a movie queen
She was one of the best

Around the world even girls adored her
Mexican bombshell
Come to conquer the west

[Chorus]
Hey, Valentina, tell your mama

Rock and roll meeting
Oh, Valentina, tell your mama
She should give me a call, yes she should

[Verse 2]
Your uncle Sam used to hold it down every day

After you down the hall

[Post-Chorus]
All worn out
Late night feedings (Late night)
Rock and roll meeting

[Bridge]
Curvier than a fender Stratocaster guitar
Reality bender: from no green card to superstar
Broken up slang even when
The king of Hollywood ain't that tall
Sho' as Betty's ugly, your mama's bigger than 'em all
Hear me, y'all (Hey, Valentina)
(Hey, Valentina)

[Guitar Solo]

[Ad Lib]
Give me a call
Walkin' down that funky hall, yeah

Oh, that's all

Hey, Valentina, tell your mama
She should give me a call

[Spoken Intro]
Turn it up

[Refrain]
You need to, you need to
You need to lay it down
You need to, you need to
You need to lay it down

[Chorus]
You need to lay it down
And let me show you how
We do this thing
Up in funky town
From the heart of Minnesota
Here come the Purple Yoda
Guaranteed to bring the dirty new sound
Come on, now

[Refrain]
You need to, you need to
(What, What, What)
You need to lay it down
(What, What, What)
You need to, you need to

You need to lay it down

[Verse 1]
You need to shut it up
Your cup ain't full enough
Let me show you what I learned
From laying in the cut
You need a six string
And let that sucker ring
The holy funk 'n roll
Let it get the people up

[Refrain]

You need to, you need to
(Get up)
You need to lay it down

To say this name borders on blasphemy
Everybody wants to be me
If your girlfriend didn't have the surgery
Maybe she could see what I see

[Refrain]
You need to, you need to
You need to lay it down
You need to, you need to
You need to lay it down

[Chorus]
You need to lay it down

Yours ain't really the grove we dance to
We need something more funky to move to
Y'all know what I'm talking 'bout
That purple bounce, bounce
Rio de Janeiro
Euro and and soon Amero
This dirty little groove for you
Let's do it now, come on, boo

[Ad lib]
Bounce, bounce
Come on, now, come on, now

[Chorus]
You need to lay it down
And let me show you how

From the heart of Minnesota
Here come the Purple Yoda
Guaranteed to bring the dirty new sound
Come on, now

Let's go

[Intro]
Oooh-oh
Mmm-oh
Time, time
Oooh-oh

[Verse 1]
This might seem strange since so much time has passed
And since only one of us still looks the same
Your words, not mine, baby
You're still fine, yes, you are
Like wine, you get better with time

[Verse 2]
So young and so naïve
That I never once believed
That the memory of you would go through me
Like wind going through the trees

Either you believe, baby
That I could not deceive you
You and I, side by side
Or somewhere in between

[Verse 3]
I don't know
I don't know if this is a bore
But I just can no longer ignore
This fact so sublime
You get better with time

[Verse 4]
Anyone who's met you agrees
That no one forgets you, most of all, not me
You can claim you're humble and hide
But when it's true, my dear, it's not pride
No
No, no

[Verse 5]
A jury of my peers would find me
Guilty of so many crimes
If I chose not to remind you
That you get better with time

Oh, this might seem absurd
To someone so cultured
And to one who would grace any stage
Listen to me now
When the hair that frames that face
Dark brown or silvery lace
What is age but a cage, never mind
You will be blind to not know
That you get better with time

[Verse 1]
Too many teardrops for one heart to be crying (I just can’t stand it
Too many teardrops for one heart to carry on, yest it is (I just can’t stand it
You’re way on top now, baby, since you left me, yeah
And you’re always laughing down at me, yes sir
But, o-o-o-oh, watch out baby, I’m gonna get there, yeah
And we’ll be together in just a little while, yes we will
And we’ll be gathering tears from way up here, oh yeah

[Chorus]
I want to see you cry, yeah, 96 tears, yes I do (96, it just won’t do

[Bridge]
I’ll be on top, and you’ll be there just looking up
I can always get up here, and I might not be waving down

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Ooh, try to get a hundred baby (96, it just won’t do
96 teardrops from you (96, it just won’t do
Oh oh, can you get a hundred, baby? yeah (can you make your tears one hundred?
96 teardrops from you, ooo, ah, ooo, ah, ooo (can you get a million, baby?
Get a million, yeah, yeah (96, it just won’t do
Can you get a million tears together? (can you make your tears one hundred?
From 96 tears, oh baby (can you get a million, baby?
‘Cause baby there ain’t just won’t do (96, it just won’t do
Ooo, just won’t, ooo, do, baby (can you make your tears one hundred?

[Intro]
Ooh, this my song
Huh
Ooh, this my song
Alright, look here, y'all
Flop hats, hot pants and gold medallions
Fake grills, huh, to the side
Look out

[Chorus]
Every once in a while you need some old school company
Somebody that appreciates a sexy groove and an old school melody
When God, His son, and the love of family ruled in the community
The songs you sing lift you up to Heaven, a Heaven we can believe in

[Verse 1]
Everybody's talking 'bout hard times like it just started yesterday
People I know, they've been struggling at least it seems that way
Fat cats on Wall Street, they got a bailout
Why somebody else got to wait?
700 billion but my old neighborhood, ain't nothin' changed but the date, listen

[Chorus]
Every once in a while you need some old school company
Somebody that appreciates a sexy groove and an old school melody, dig
When God, His son, and the love of family ruled in the community
The songs you sing lift you up to Heaven, a Heaven we can believe in

[Verse 2]
Ain't nothing ever came from complaining 'cept a bitter heart, that's true
Follow along and you going to want to do something before the next chorus is through
The songs we sang, they used to mean something
Now every other one's just mean
Rather than reminisce, I'm telling you this: it's time for a brand new scene, oh

[Chorus]
Every once in a while you need some old school company
Somebody that appreciates a sexy groove and an old school melody (Old school melody)
When God, His son, and the love of family ruled in the community
(it ruled, y'all, yes it did)
The songs we used to sang lift you up to Heaven, a Heaven we can believe in

[Verse 3]
Everybody's sinking in the quicksand created by the keepers of time
Cast aside by using ancient tricks that changing your state of mind
Got you catering the whims of the flesh before
Before you get your paper right
Call me old-fashioned, but back in the day wasn't no shorties in sight

[Chorus]
'Cause every day need some, ooh
(Old school company) We need it
Sexy groove
(Old school melody)
While we were pleadin'
Ruled in the community
Lift you up, a heaven we can believe in
(Believe me, baby)

[Verse 4]
First come job, then come marriage
Before shorty come out with the baby carriage
Call me old-fashioned, just clap your hands, just clap your hands
Radio used to be local, untouched by, untouched by the man
Songs we used to sang used to mean something
Now they just bland, like the drummer

[Chorus]
(Old school company) Where's the real drummer?
(Old school melody) Where's the real drummer?
Michael B., Mint Condition, Morris Day
(Ruled in the community)
And Jellybean wishing Sheila E
(Life you up) And brother John
And sometimes me until the dawn

[Interlude]
If the white house is black, we got to take the radio back
Power to the people
Power to the people

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 5]
New world hippies say we don't care
Make the party strip to their underwear
Turn the lights off so they don't stare
Somebody blindfold Billy, he's so square

Christina Milian playin' "Truth or Dare?"
Maxwell and CeeLo, they gonna end up there
Pickin' out the number, nickel, dime, don't care
As long as she havin' fun, nobody scared

[Chorus]
I got a pocket full of, I got a pocket full of plenty good time
(Old school company)
Whoa Lord, and Nicole's on the line
(Old school melody)
No baby, you can't get in, uh, Lord
And neither can your man
(Ruled n the community)
You see, we got this girl with this abusive thing goin' on
I'm just a bad mamajama, and y'all can't understand
Oh! Hit it

[Interlude]
The new Minneapolis sound
Honey collected, drop the needle down
(Old school company)
(The old school melody)
Well, how do you do?
See, there ain't another like me up in this chocolate box
You gotta dance for me, baby, if you wanna see me rock
Call the government man, tell him we got to be free
Valentina, tonight? Huh, I'm busy
So tell your mama 77 Beverly Park gets better with time, mm
We got the old school company, y'all, dancin' in the dark
I don't mind, I say I don't mind
Put this thing on repeat
Go back to one and just move your feet and
Tell your friends Prince and the Minneapolis sound
We can't be beat, suckas!

[Outro]
Old school company
The old school melody
Ruled in the community
Lift you up, a heaven we can believe in

[Spoken Intro]
Hey, sugar
I know it’s been a minute
But I got to, I got to get up
Come on
Let’s talk about what you got

I don’t think you understand
It makes me
Can I talk a lil’ bit, oh
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Baby, you got something that would make
A many brother mighty proud
I gotta say it loud (I got to say it loud)
You got a dozen little sexy tricks
That a dozen cities in this U.S. won’t, won't even allow
Never do you boast like the other chicks
Who think they’re fine and loved, said loved the floor
And what I dig the most is that you keep it in your hand
Until I, until I, until I want it

[Chorus]
If ever, whenever you need someone to take a shower with
Call me up please
Extra lovable, honey don’t you wanna, don’t you wanna
Take a bath with me?

[Verse 2]
Baby, you could turn anybody on, I wait my turn however long
Even if it takes eternity
Time can pass away but every day I make a play
Just hear you say the same about me
Baby, I know my rap is strong
Not as strong as your perfume
That’s okay, I like it
Not as much as I would like a chance to see you dancing naked
Oh, I’d really want to see you dance

[Chorus]
If ever, whenever you need someone to take a shower with
Call me up please
Extra lovable, honey don’t you wanna, don’t you wanna
Take a bath with me?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Sugar baby, you’re so fine
But see, you had me meet between the lines
Might be kinda popular but if you want, I’m yours
You can ask what we’re gonna do
I think you’d better shut the door
You know what I’m talking about, baby
Oh, let me hear you say
Come on
Scandalous

[Chorus]
If ever, whenever you need someone to take a shower with
Call me up please
Extra lovable, honey don’t you wanna, don’t you wanna
Take a bath with me?
It brings big tears into my eyes
When I began, when I began to realize
That I've cried so much, oh since you've been gone
I guess I'll drown in, drown in my own tears

I've been crying just like a child
These tears of mine, these tears are running wild
And if you don't think, if you don't think that you'll be home soon
Baby, I'm gonna drown, oh yeah, in my own tears

Here without you
I get so lonely and I so get blue, yes I do
It seems to keep raining
Raining, raining more and more

Here without you, baby
I so get lonely and I get so blue
Whatever the time I look around it's raining
More and more and more and more and more

Why can't you, why can't you, why can't you come on home?
Because I don't wanna be, I don't want to be here all alone
Listen, if you don't think, If you don't think that you're coming home soon, you got to be a 

[?]
I believe I'm gonna drown this morning
I'll tell you that I'm gonna, gonna drown this evening
Don't let him let me, don't let him let me, don't let him let me, don't let him let me
Drown in my own tears
I don't wanna drown in my own tears
I'm gonna drown in my, oh, in my own tears
Tears, my tears, tears
Oh, don't let him do it, don't let him do it
I don't want to drown in my own tears

[Intro]
Nine out of ten mortals agree today
Too much fame causes spiritual decay
Yeah!
Ow!
Ow ow ow!

[Verse 1]
To all the punks who believe
That life imitates music
No more candy for you
We can't hang with you
To all the punks who want to be rock stars
And do what they do
There's no future for you
That's the life of a fool

[Refrain]
No more candy, no more candy for you
We're too funky, and you can't handle our groove
Get it now!

[Verse 2]
To all the freaks in the magazines
Uh, who never paid no dues
No more candy for you
You can't sing, it's true
To all the freaks walking into walls
Somebody put a spell on you
No more candy for you
I guess the devil got a brand new fool

[Refrain]
No more candy, no more candy for you
We're too funky, and you can't handle our groove

[Bridge]
No more candy
No more candy
No more candy
No more candy

[Refrain]
No more candy, no more candy for you

[Ad lib]
Look out, sugar
Ooh

[Refrain]
No more candy, no more candy for you

[Verse 3]
To all the haters on the internet
Somebody's looking at you
No more candy for you
They got your number now, fool
To all the suckers winning anything
And thanking the lord for what you do
No more candy for you, no more candy for you

[Refrain]
No more candy, no more candy for you
No more candy for you, yeah

[Outro]
No more candy, no more candy for you
I'm too funky, and you can't handle my groove
No more candy, no more candy for you, no more candy for you

[Verse 1]
You're a no good heartbreaker
You're a liar and you're a cheat
And I don't know why
I let you do these things to me
My friends keep telling me
That you ain't no good
But oh, they don't know
That I'd leave you if I could
I guess I'm uptight
And I'm stuck like glue

[Chorus]
'Cause I ain't never
I ain't never, I ain't never, no, no
Loved a man, the way that I, I love you

[Verse 2]
Some time ago I thought
You had run out of fools
But I was so wrong
You got one that you'll never lose
The way you treat me is a shame
How could you hurt me so bad?
Baby, you know that I'm the best thing
That you ever had

[Pre-Chorus]
Kiss me once again
Don't you never, never say that we we're through

[Chorus]
'Cause I ain't never
Never, Never, no, no
Loved a man, the way that I, I love you

[Bridge]
I can't sleep at night
And I can't eat a bite
I guess I'll never be free
Since you got, your hooks, in me
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
I ain't never loved a man
I ain't never loved a man, baby
Ain't never had a man hurt me so bad, no
Well, this is what I'm gonna do about it
I tell you, I'm gonna hold on to it
Yeah, I'm gonna hold on to it, yeah

[Intro]
Only you can hear my soul serenade

[Verse]
I want to be free to fly away and sing to the world
About my soul serenade, my soul serenade
When you're not around there's a lonely sound
In my soul serenade, in my soul serenade
Everyone but you adores me
But do you know pretty soon they bore me
Let me tell you right now that they bore me
They bore me with their pretty little words
Those pretty little words of devotion
But oh, let me tell you right now
My message to 'em this evening
Is they can jump in anybody's ocean

[Outro]
Because only you hear my soul
My soul serenade, my soul serenade
My soul serenade, my soul serenade

[Verse 1]
If I lose this dream (This dream)
I don't know what I'm going to do
If I lose this dream (This dream)
I'm dreaming about for me and you

[Bridge]
If it goes away I might as well hang it up
'Cause I don't know
If I have the heart or mind
To make it true, to help it grow
And I only know, I only know, I only know

[Verse 2]
If I lose this dream (This dream)
It's goodbye love and happiness, yes
You're the one I need
I don't want a love that's second best

[Bridge]
There've been things all of my life
I wanted to do that made me blue
Help me hold onto this dream
For sometimes dreams often come true
And they all come true, they all come true
For me and you
(Wait a minute, baby)

[Chorus]
Don't let me lose this dream
Baby, baby, hold on
Don't let me lose my dream
Baby, baby, be strong

[Verse 3]
You say that, uh, you believe that what I say is true
And that I'm the one and only girl for you
Just tell me that no matter what the people say
You're in my corner all the way

[Chorus]
And I won't let me lose this dream
Baby, baby, hold on
Don't let me lose my dream
Baby, baby, be strong
Don't me, ooh baby
Baby, baby, hold on

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, baby, this is just to say
How much I'm going to miss you
But believe while I'm away
That I didn't mean to hurt you
Don't you know that I'd rather hurt myself?
(I'd hurt myself, I'd hurt myself)

[Verse]
Baby, baby, baby (Baby)
Think of me sometimes (Baby)
Because if loving you was so wrong (Baby)
Then I'm guilty of this crime
(Guilty, I'm guilty, I'm guilty)
I'm bewildered, I'm lonely, and I'm loveless
Without you to hold my hand
(Reach out for me, boy)
If you'd just understand
(Reach out to me, right now)
Those that we love, we foolishly make cry
Then sometimes feel it's best to say goodbye, goodbye
But what's inside can't be denied
The power (Power of love)
The power of love (Power of love)
Is my only guide
Baby (Oh)
Baby (Oh)
Baby (Oh)

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, baby, this is just to say
How much I'm going to miss you
But believe while I'm away
(I need you, I need you, I need you)
That I really didn't mean, I didn't mean, I didn't mean to hurt you
Don't you know that, that I'd rather hurt myself?
(I'd hurt myself)

[Outro]
Baby, I need you, I need you, I need you
If I did you wrong, if I did you wrong
(I'd hurt myself)
I need you, I need you, I need you
If I did you wrong
(I'd hurt myself)

[Verse 1]
I don't want nobody, always
Sittin' around me and my man
I don't want nobody, always
Sittin' right there
Lookin' at me and that man
Be it my mother, my brother, or my sister
Would you believe, I'll get up, put on some clothes
Go out and help them find somebody for theirself if I can
Yes I will

[Bridge]
Now, I don't mind company
Because company's alright with me every once in awhile
Yes it is
I say I don't mind company
Because company's alright with me every once in awhile
Yeah
But oh, oh, when me and that man get to lovin'
I tell you, girl, I dig you, but I just don't have time
To sit, and chit, and sit and chit-chat and smile

[Chorus]
Don't send me no doctor
Fillin' me up with all of those pills
I got me a man named Doctor Feelgood
And oh, yeah, that man takes care of all of my pains and my ills
His name is Doctor Feelgood in the morning
And takin' care of business is really this man's game
And after one visit to Dr. Feelgood
You'll understand why Feelgood is his name

[Outro]
Oh! Yeah! Ooh!
Good God almighty, the man sure makes me feel real
Good!

[Chorus]
Everybody get in the groove and let the good times roll
I'm going to stay here 'til I soothe my soul
If it takes all night long

[Verse]
Yeah, it might be one o'clock and it might be three
Time don't mean that much to me
I ain't had this much fun since I don't know when
And I might not feel this good again

[Chorus]
Oh, get in the groove and let the good times roll
I'm going to stay here 'til I soothe my soul
If it takes all night long, yeah

[Bridge]
All night
Takes all day
All night and all day

[Chorus]
I'm gonna get in the groove and let the good times roll
Stay here still I soothe my soul
If it takes all night long

[Verse]
Yeah, it might be one o'clock and it might be three
I don't care 'cause time means nothing to me
I ain't been swingin' since I don't know when
And I might not be swingin' this way again

[Chorus]
Oh, get in the groove and let the good times roll
You can stay here 'til you soothe your soul
If it takes all night long, yeah

[Outro]
All night
All day
All night and all day
I'm gonna stay here
I ain't gonna move
Go on, soul brother
Help me find the groove
I don't care who's knocking on my door
Somebody answer

[Verse 1]
Take me to heart, and I'll always love you
And nobody can make me do wrong
Take me for granted, leaving love unshown
Makes willpower weak and temptation strong

[Pre-Chorus]
A woman's only human
You should understand
She's not just a plaything
She's flesh and blood just like her man

[Chorus]
If you want a do right, home days woman
(Do right, do right, do right, do right woman)
You've got to be a do right, home nights man
(Do right, do right, do right, do right man, man)

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, they say that it's a man's world
But you can't prove that by me
And as long as we're together, baby
Show some respect for me

[Chorus]
If you want a do right, home days woman
(Do right, do right, do right, do right woman)
You've got to be a do right, home nights man
(Do right, do right, do right, do right man, man)

[Pre-Chorus]
A woman's only human
You should understand
She's not just a plaything
She's flesh and blood just like her man

[Chorus]
If you want a do right, home days woman
(Do right, do right, do right, do right woman)
You've got to be a do right, home nights man
(Why don't you? Why don't you? Why don't you? Why don't you?)
You got to be a do right, home nights man

[Chorus]
Save me, somebody save me
Save me, somebody save me, yeah

[Verse 1]
Promised myself after the first romance
I wouldn't give you a second chance
They say if you seek, you're sure to find
But the closer I get to you, baby
You drive me stone outta my mind

[Chorus]
Save me oh, yeah
Save me, yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
Those who love always give the most
We're crying together from coast to coast
Love leaves us cold and hurt inside
These tears of ours, unjustified

[Chorus]
Begging you to, save me
Yeah, I need somebody to save me, yeah, hey hey hey

[Verse 3]
Your love said you needed me
You abused my love, set me free
You didn't need, you didn't want me
Somebody help me, this man wants to taunt me
I'm begging you to, oh

[Chorus]
Save me, yeah
Please save me

[Verse 4]
Calling the Caped Crusader, Green Hornet, Kato, too
I'm in so much trouble I don't know what to do
If you think anything about me

[Outro]
Save me, oh yeah, yeah, come on
I just said, save me, baby, come on
Save me, save me
Oh, save me
Oh, save me

[Hook]
You better think (think)
Think about what you're trying to do to me
Think (think, think)
Let your mind go, let yourself be free

[Verse 1]
Let's go back, let's go back
Let's go way on way back when
I didn't even know you
You couldn't have been too much more than ten (just a child)
I ain't no psychiatrist, I ain't no doctor with degrees
But it don't take too much high IQ to see what you're doing to me

[Hook]
You better think (think)
Think about what you're trying to do to me
Yeah, think (think, think)
Let your mind go, let yourself be free

[Chorus]
'Cause freedom (freedom)
Stands for freedom (freedom)
Oh freedom
Yeah freedom, right now
Freedom (freedom)
Oh oh freedom (freedom)
Give me some freedom
Oh oh freedom, right now

[Link]
Yeah, think about it!
You, think about it!

[Verse 2]
There ain't nothing you could ask
I could answer you but I won't (I won't)
But I was gonna change, but I'm not
If you keep doing things I don't

[Hook]
You better think (think)
Think about what you're trying to do to me
Oh oh-oh-oh think (What you're tryna to do to me)
(Think)
Let your mind go, let yourself be free

[Verse 3]
People walking around everyday
Playing games and taking scores
Trying to make other people lose their minds
Well, be careful, you're goin' to lose yours

[Chorus]
Oh, think (think)
Think about what you're trying to do to me
Wooh! Think (think)
Let your mind go, let yourself be free

[Bridge]
You need me (need me)
And I need you (don't you know?)
Without each other
There ain't nothing neither can do

[Outro to fade]
Oh yeah, think about me
(What you're tryin' do to me)
When I'm gone baby
Think about it right now
Yeah, right now
(Think about, forgiveness) Oh
(Think about, forgiveness) Yeah right now
(Think about, forgiveness)
(Think about it ) Please baby, baby, baby
(Think about, forgiveness) Oh, think about baby
(Think about, forgiveness) Yeah, ooh...

Mockingbird

[Chorus]
Everybody have you heard
He's going to buy me a mockingbird
Well now, if that mockingbird don't sing
He's going to buy me a diamond ring
And if that diamond ring don't shine
He's going to surely break this heart of mine
And that's why I can't tell him that sad thing

[Verse 1]
Oh, I know I love him and I can't tell him so

And that's why I can't tell him that sad thing
Oh oh oh, I, everybody have you heard
He's going to buy me a mockingbird
Said now, if that mockingbird don't sing
He's going to buy me a diamond ring

[Verse 1]
(I say a little prayer for you)
The moment I wake up
Before I put on my makeup (Makeup)
I say a little (Prayer for you)
And while I'm combing my hair now
And wondering what dress to wear now (Wear now)
I say a little (Prayer for you)

[Chorus]
(Forever) Forever, (And ever) yeah
(You'll stay in my heart and I will love you)

[Verse 1]
My love has no beginning, my love has no end
No front, no back, and my love won't bend
And I'm in the middle, lost in a spin

[Chorus]
Loving you
And you don't know, you don't know, you don't know, you don't know
You don't know how glad I am

[Verse 2]
My love has no bottom, my love has no top
My love won't rise, and my love won't drop
And I'm in the middle, and I can't stop

[Chorus]
Loving you
And you don't know, you don't know, you don't know
You don't know how glad I am

[Bridge]
I wish I were a poet, so that I could express
What I, what I'd like to say
I wish I were an artist, so that I could paint a picture
Of how I feel (How I feel), see what I feel (What I feel) today

[Verse 3]
My love has no walls on either side
That makes my love wider than wide
And I'm in the middle, and I can't hide

[Outro]
Loving you
And you don't know, you couldn't, you don't know
You couldn't, you don't know just how glad I am
And you don't know, you don't know, you don't know, you don't know
How glad I am

[Intro]
There's an old friend that
I once heard say
Something that touched my heart
And it began this way

[Verse 1]
I was born by the river
In a little tent
And just like the river
I've been running ever since

[Chorus]
He said it's been a long time coming
But I know my change is gonna come, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
He said it's been too hard livin'
But I'm afraid to die
I might not be if I knew what was up there
Beyond the sky

[Chorus]
It's been a long, long time coming
But I know my change is got to come, oh yeah

[Verse 4]
I went, I went to my brother
And I asked him, "Brother
Could you help me, please?"
He said, "Good sister
I'd like to but I'm not able"
And when I, when I looked around
I was right back down
Down on my bended knees, yes I was, oh

[Verse 5]
There've been times that I thought
I thought that I wouldn't last for long
But somehow, right now
I believe that I'm able, I'm able to carry on
I tell you that it's been a long
And oh, it's been an uphill journey, all the way

[Chorus]
But I know, I know, I know
I know my change is gonna come

[Verse 6]
Sometimes
I had to cry all night long, yes I did
Sometimes
I had to give up right, for what I knew was wrong
Yes. it's been an uphill journey
It's sure's been a long way coming, yes it has
It's been real hard, every step of the way
But I believe, I believe

[Chorus]
This evening my change is come
Yeah, I tell you that my change is come

[Verse 1]
Sometimes you love me
Like a good man oughta
Sometimes you hurt me so bad
My tears run like water
Ya get me out
Not before your friends
And then ya disown me, baby
Until we're alone again

[Chorus]
Your love is like a see saw
Your love is like a see saw, baby
Your love is like a see saw
Going up (Up)
Down (Down)
And all around
Like a see saw

[Verse 2]
Sometimes you tell me
You're gon' be my sweet candy man
And then sometimes, baby
Never know where I stand
Ya lift me up
When I'm on the ground
But as soon as I get uptown
You send me tumblin' down

[Chorus]
Now your love is like a see saw
Your love is like a see saw, baby
Your love is like a see saw
Going up (Up)
Down (Down)
And all around
It's like a see saw

[Bridge]
When I kiss ya and I like it
And I ask you to kiss me again
When I reach for you, you jump clean outta sight
Ya change just like the wind
That ain't right, that ain't right, that ain't right
(It ain't right) It ain't right, baby

[Outro]
Your love is like a see saw
Your love is like a see saw, baby
You love is like a see saw
Going up (Up)
Down (Down)
And all around
It's like a see saw
Your love is like a see saw
Your love is like a see saw, baby
You love is like a see saw
Going up (Up)
Down (Down)
And all around
It's like a see saw, yeah, ah baby (See saw)

[Verse 1]
If you see me walking down the street
And I start to cry each time we meet

[Chorus]
Walk on by, walk on by
Just make believe
That you don't see the tears
Just let me grieve
In private because each time I see you
I break down and cry
Walk on by
(Don't stop)
And walk on by
(Don't stop)
And walk on by

[Verse 2]
I just can't get over losing you
And so if I seem broken and blue

[Chorus]
Walk on by, walk on by
'Cause foolish pride
Is all that I have left
So let me hide
The tears and the sadness you gave me
When you said goodbye
Walk on by
(Don't stop)
Walk on by
(Don't stop)
Walk on by
(Don't stop)

[Break]

[Chorus]
Walk on by, walk on by
This foolish pride
Is all that I have left
So let me hide
The tears and the sadness you gave me
When you said goodbye
Walk on by
(Don't stop)
Walk on by
(Don't stop)

[Outro]
Now you know you gotta go so walk on by
(Don't, no, don't, don't stop)
Make believe you never see the tears I cry
(Don't, no, don't, don't stop)
Now you know you gotta go so walk on by
(Don't, no, don't, don't stop)
Make believe you never see the tears I cry
(Don't, no, don't, don't stop)

[Chorus 1]
Prove it, Prove it, Prove it, Prove it to me

[Verse 1]
Prove
That it won't bother me
To become your used to be
Prove
That I can just Ignore
All the love we shared before

Prove it to my starving Heart
Prove it to my starving Heart
Prove it now before we part
Prove it now before we part

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2]
Prove
The loneliness I'll find
Will be only in my mind
Prove
That all these tears that fall
Aren't really tears at all
Prove that I don't want to die
Prove that I don't want to die
Now that you say, "It's goodbye
Now that you say, "It's goodbye

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3]
Before you walk out that door
Prove, I won't love you no more
Prove that i'll forget your kiss
In your arms, I'll never miss
Never Miss
Now let me see you
Prove it
Just let me see you
Prove it

[Chorus 2]
Prove,that I don't want to die
Now, That you say, "It's Goodbye

[Verse 1]
In the evening, when the sun goes down
You’re gonna find me, doing
What I’m doing right now, and next just sitting around

[Chorus]
The night life, it ain’t no good life
But it’s my life, yes it is

[Verse 2]
And all good people, good people, just like you and me
They’re sitting around dreaming
Sitting around dreaming about that used to be

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Oh, listen to the blues, to the blues and what they’re playing
I wonder tonight, are you really listening to the blues
To the blues and what they’re saying
What they seem to be playing to me that’s, that many people have loved
And they seem to be saying to me that many people have lost
Well, listen, they might not to have loved at all
If they had know that they couldn’t pay the cost
Oh, they tell me, yeah, they tell me, yeah, they tell me, yeah, they tell me
They tell me that life is just an empty scene
They say that is older than the oldest broken hearts
And they tell me that is newer than the newest stood dreams

[Chorus]
You know the night time

Every night I cry, every night I sigh
Every night I wonder why
You treat me cold
Yet you won't let me go

Every little hurt counts (every little hurt counts)
Every little hurt counts

You say you're coming home
Yet you never phone, leave me all alone
My love is strong for you, and I'd do wrong for you

And I just can't go on giving my life away

Yet you hurt me, desert me

Oh, come back to me (come back to me)
And I'll make you see (I'll make you see)
That I can give you all
The things that you wanted before
If you will stay, stay with me

Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts
Every, every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts

[Prince]
Hello?

(Vanessa)
Hello, Prince?

[Prince]
Yes?

(Vanessa)
This is Vanessa Bartholomew

[Prince]
Where have you been?

(Vanessa)
I've been trying to interview you now for a long time

[Prince]
No...
(Vanessa)
You're a hard man to track down
I hope you don't mind I'm recording our conversati–

[Prince hangs up]

(Vanessa)
...Hello?
Son of a bitch hung up

[Verse 1]
Out of the womb I slipped
Between two vaginal lips
Pushed to the light of a sight
A fetus into a child
In the spring of the suns
But not the wet 'n' wild
Journey conceived
My fathers sperm giving my mother a seed
Implanted it in the ovaries
Of eternity and entity
Organism in the system of creation
Sperm swimming in the lake
Fluids that make
Being in the congruent state
Through movement i was able to generate
Enough energy to surpass fate
And become part of human race
Waiting for the cervical canal to dilate
Silently, silently searching for a trace of a base
That I can call my own
And aware my surroundings built under my creators
Sanctuary was my home
Binding with this life with force I would twist my body
Communicating with my mother pounding on her uterus
With my underdeveloped kick
The pulsation was my snare
The moment we share was rare
One breath, one life, one love
Push came to shove
I didn't want to budge by the force form above
Let me know, it was the time to go, told me so
A baby boy
With the the ovum of the X and Y chromosome
Being born within the ozone
At the throne of the dome
Called Earth birthed to a child of the cosmos

[Chorus]
Earthlings
Gossip, talk walk the same

[?]
Melodramatic soap opera drama
And short change themselves for other's opinions, It's a shame
Earthlings
Gossip, talk walk the same

[?]
Melodramatic soap opera drama
And short change themselves for other's opinions, It's a shame

[Verse 2]
I'm an outsider, outcast
Put in the public school system with my peers
I honestly couldn't last
Always passed
But felt like I was from a different planet
Knew my origin, the question that others took for granted
Don't forget where you came from
From the Fallopian tube
From the flesh of your mother's breast
You used to hang from
We got a nation held to ransom
Killed in selfish ways
And today
Let's start the planning of enhancements for our grandsons
Offsprings, daughters bending Marauders and handguns
...

[Chorus]
Earthlings
Gossip, talk walk the same

[?]
Melodramatic soap opera drama
And short change themselves for other's opinions, It's a shame
Earthlings
Gossip, talk walk the same

[?]
Melodramatic soap opera drama
And short change themselves for other's opinions, It's a shame
Earthlings
Gossip, talk walk the same

[?]
Melodramatic soap opera drama
And short change themselves for other's opinions, It's a shame
Earthlings
Gossip, talk walk the same

[?]
Melodramatic soap opera drama
And short change themselves for other's opinions, It's a shame

[Verse 1]
Someday, someway, you'll realize that you've been blind
Yes darling, you're going to need me again
And it's just a matter of time
Go on, go on until you've reached the end of the line
Because I know that you'll pass my way again
And it's just a little matter of time

[Bridge]
After I gave you everything I had
You laughed, you laughed and you called me a clown
Remember in your search for fortune and fame
What goes up is coming down

[Outro]
I said I know
And that something you did to me makes me know
That someday you'll wake up and find
That my love was a true, true love
And it's just a matter of time

[Chorus]
Hello (Hello) sunshine
So glad to see you sunshine
Hello (Hello) sunshine
It's been dark for a very long time

[Verse 1]
I can't explain what I've been through (No, no)
Trying to live my life without you
People say I act so strange (Oh yeah)
But you got the power to make me change

[Chorus]
Hello (Hello) sunshine
I'm so glad to see you sunshine
Hello (Hello) sunshine
It's been dark for a very long time

[Bridge]
Without you sunshine (Without you sunshine)
The world is such a lonely place (Oh yeah)
And without you sunshine (Without you sunshine)
My heart was filled with an empty space (Oh yeah)
Without you sunshine (Without you sunshine)
The wind and the rain (Oh yeah)
The wonders of spring don't mean a thing
Without you, baby
Without you, baby
Without you, baby
Without you, baby (Without you)

[Verse 2]
Now I know everything is alright (You know)
No more pain and no more sleepless nights (Oh yeah)
My days were dark but now I see (Oh yeah)
Because my sunshine has come home to me

[Outro]
Without you sunshine (Without you sunshine)
The world is such a lonely place (Oh yeah)
And without you sunshine (Without you sunshine)
My heart was filled with an empty space (Oh yeah)
Without you sunshine (Without you sunshine)
The wind and the rain (Oh yeah)
It don't mean a thing (Don't mean a thing)
The wonders of spring (Don't mean a thing)
Without you, baby (Don't mean a thing)
Without you, baby (Without you sunshine)
Oh, without you, baby (Oh yeah)
Oh, without you, baby (Without you sunshine)
Oh, without you, baby (Oh yeah)

[Verse 1]
Sure you haven't got the wrong number?
You sure it's me you want to talk to tonight?
Everyone in town's got your number
Everybody's got you pegged right

[Chorus]
Is that why you got in touch with me?
I guess you must be running out of fools

[Verse 2]
When you went and left me there crying
Your goodbye was even colder than ice
It didn't bother you I was crying
And now you want to break my heart twice

[Chorus]
Is that why you got in touch with me?
I guess you must be running out of fools

[Bridge]
Guess you got back (Guess you got)
To my name (To my name)
In your little black book
Well, listen
Tell you what (Tell you what)
Bet you forgot (You forgot)
How I even look

[Verse 3]
So go ahead with all your sweet talking
Go ahead for all the good it can do
Have yourself a dime's worth of talking
And then I'm going to hang right up on you

[Chorus]
Because this time, you're not, you're not getting through to me
I guess you must be running out of fools

[Outro]
Even fools like me
Even fools like me
I said you're running out of fools
Even old fools like me

[Verse]
Nothing you could say could tear me away from my guy
(My guy)
Nothing you could do because I'm stuck like glue to my guy
(My guy)
I'm sticking to my guy like a stamp to a letter
Like birds of a feather we stick together
I'm telling you from the start I can't be torn apart from my guy
Nothing you could do could make me untrue to my guy
(My guy)
Nothing you could buy could make me tell a lie to my guy
(My guy)
I gave my guy my word of honor to be faithful, and I'm going to
You best be believing I won't be deceiving my guy

[Bridge]
As a matter of opinion I think he's tops
My opinion is he's the cream of the crop;
As a matter of taste to be exact he's my ideal as a matter of fact

[Chorus] 

[x3]
No muscle-bound man could take my hand from my guy
(My guy)
No handsome face could ever take the place of my guy
(My guy)
He may not be a movie star, but when it comes to being happy we are
There's not a man today who could take me away from my guy
(What you say, Tell me more)

[Intro]
Two sides
Two sides of love can make me wonder
Can lift me up or pull me under
The different ways that you can be bother me

[Verse]
Because there are sometimes
You treat me nice and whisper so sweetly
You make me feel you’re mine completely
And when you hold me like you do then I love you
But then there goes times
You smile at girls
Start me wonder if worth being fail and so down
You make me feel you don’t want me around

[Chorus] 

[x2]
You’re making me a girl with two sides
One part of me can never, ever trust you
The other part keeps wanting just you
So if you find I’m acting strange
Then you’re the one who made me change

[Outro]
You took my love and you tore it all apart
Took my heart right from the start
You’re making me a girl with two si

[Intro]
I'm looking for a love-maker
I ain't looking for no heartbreaker

[Verse 1]
It ain't no fooling around with this
Ain't no fooling around with that
You've been playing the scene long enough
To know just where it's at
Some people call me selfish because I want you to myself
But it better be a crazy day in July if I catch you with someone else

[Chorus]
I wanna see a change in you, baby
I wanna see a change right away
I wanna see a change in you, baby
I wanna see a change in you today
If you don't, this girl is gonna make you pay
If you don't, this girl is gonna make you pay
I wanna see a big change in you, baby
A big change in you, baby
A big change in you, baby
A big change in you, baby

[Verse 2]
I hope you've been busy 'bout what you know
'Cause they say you gotta reap what you sow
And you say you know that I'm for you
When you had a choice of quite a few
Well, you just picked out what you wanted
And it was me you said you liked
And I must admit you got good taste
So great to get over right

[Chorus]
I wanna see a change in you, baby
I wanna see a change in you today
I wanna see a change in you, baby
I wanna see a change in you today
If you don't, this girl is gonna make you pay
I wanna see a big change in you, baby
A big change in you, baby
A big change in you, baby
A big change in you, baby

[Outro]
I'm looking for a love-maker
Can't use no heartbreakers

I wanna see a big change in you, baby
A big change in you, baby
A big change in you, baby
A big change in you, baby
I wanna see a big change in you, baby
A big change in you, baby
A big change in you, baby
A big change in you, baby
I wonder
My darling
Where are you again tonight?
Are you holding someone else real tight?
Baby, I wonder

My heart...
My heart is aching
I believe that I'm a fool
To let it go on breaking
Maybe I wake up and find now that I'm mistaken
Oh but right now, I wonder

I've been through
Lover's Lane
And I'm living life
Just the same
I've been travelling
Nowhere faced
And what I wanna know
What I want to know is will it last?
Oh oh I wonder
I wonder
My darling
Will you think of me?
Will you think of me again tonight?
Or are you holding someone else real tight?
Ouh yeah-he-he baby I wonder

I've been through...
I've been through Lover's Lane
And I'm living life...
Living in just the same
I've been travelling...
Been travelling but nowhere faced
And what I wanna know right now
What I want to know is will it last?

I wonder, I wonder, I wonder, I wonder
My my my my my my my darling
Will you think of me?
Will you think of me every day?
Although I may be a million miles away
Right now I wonder
Although I...
Although I may be a million miles away
Baby, baby, I wonder

[Verse 1]
I don’t need no diamonds (She don’t need)
And I don’t need no money (She don’t need, she don’t)
Some people live in castles with sixty or seventy rooms (She don’t)
Some people dream about a penthouse tall or a mansion on the moon

[Chorus]
But I got me a little one room paradise
And the man I love (And the man I love)
And that’s all I need now
And the man I love (And the man I love)

[Verse 2]
Some girls are crazy about diamonds (Diamonds)
And some go wild about pearls (Go wild)
Some girls go for a lot of loot
From a checkbook that ain't hers (Sure ain't hers)

[Chorus]
But I got me a little one room paradise
And the man I love (And the man I love)
And that’s all I need now
And the man I love (And the man I love)

[Bridge]
Now, if one day he lucks up on a magic pot of gold (Pot of gold)
I wouldn't mind a little diamond ring or a fur coat for the cold (Ooh)
But if it meant I had to lose just what I've got right now (Right now)
Then I don’t need no gold anyhow (No, no, oh)

[Verse 3]
I can’t make love with no diamonds (diamonds)
Give them all to somebody else (anybody)
And what good is one hundred rooms if you’re there all by yourself (Yes, you)

[Chorus]
So I’ll take me my little one room paradise
And the man I love (And the man I love)
Well, that’s all I need now
And the man I love (And the man I love)

[Outro]
I don’t need no diamonds (She don’t need no diamonds)
Said I don’t need no money (She don’t need no money, she don’t)

[Verse]
You've been running around
This I know, yeah
I ought to pack my things
And let you go
But baby

[Chorus]
I don't know what to do
I can't see myself
Going away to stay
Whoa, no, I can't see myself leaving you

[Verse 2]
You've been running around
With every girl in town
Yes, you have
If I just had the power
I'd put you right down
Whoa, oh, my love

[Chorus]
I don't know what to do
Cause I can't see myself
Going away to stay
Oh no, I can't see myself leaving you, no

[Bridge]
True love is so hard to find
Tell me, tell me that I've got mine
If I go searching for another
I'd just be wasting my time, yeah, hey

[Verse 3]
I say we're through
Because I love you
Yes, I do
If I leave you, baby
What would I do?
Whoa, oh, oh, my love

[Chorus]
I wouldn't know what to do
'Cause I can't see myself leaving you
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
I can't see myself leaving you, no
I can't see myself leaving you

[Outro]
Whoa, no
I can't see myself leaving you, no
I can't see myself (I can't see myself)
Leaving you (I can't see myself)
Oh no (I can't see myself)
I can't see myself (I can't see myself)
Oh no (I can't see myself)

[Verse]
I have got the blues for the highway
Rambling blues, I got to go
I better start running
Because walking for me is much too slow, oh, yes it is
I’m undecided whether to go or stay
It’s true I love you baby but I can not make it this way
Oh, baby, I just can’t make it this way, oh no, I can’t

[Bridge]
You have got me worried every night and day, oh yes, I do now
Well I’m just plain and tired sick of your funky ways
Yeah, hey, baby, yeah
Tell them about it
I understand you
Yeah, tell them about it, yeah, oh

[Outro]
So long baby, baby, goodbye
I’m going start rambling, going to be rambling till the day I die
Yeah, baby, gonna ramble ramble ramble ramble
Get into something until the day I die, yes I am
Oh, so long, oh, so long
Tell them about it, tell them about it right now
So long baby, oh yeah
Tell the story, rambling
I’m going to be rambling
Till the day I die, yeah, oh yeah
You got it baby, you got it
So long baby, oh

[Verse 1]
I've been all across the country
And I've stayed in every town
You see, I'm trying to find my baby
And he ain't nowhere around, I can't understand it
You know which way I'm heading, if my baby can’t be found
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Well, I spoke to the river
And the river, the river spoke back to me
It said, "Oh! You look so lonely, and so much full of misery
Yes, you do now
If you can't find your baby
Come on, girl, and make your home with me, oh yeah"

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I don't want to leave him
No, I know, I know he’s still alive
And someday, I'm going to find him
And he's gonna take me for a ride - yes, he will now
And then we'll live forever and ever and ever
Forever and ever among the tides
Oh, yes, we will

[Outro]
Just in case I don't find him, I'm going to take that river's invitation
River's invitation
Oh, oh, the river! Oh, oh, the river
Oh, the river, yeah, oh, river's invitation
Yeah, the river

[Intro]
Oh pitiful
Feel so sorry for me
Pitiful
It's pitiful
Feel so sorry for me
Though you do not love me you see
You still won't set me free
Oh set me free

[Verse]
I wonder why I wondered why you do me like you do
I wonder why you do me like you do
When you know that I love you baby
And you know I wouldn't do it to you
No no
It looks like it makes you happy
Just to see me cry
Please have mercy on this
Vacant heart of mine
You're trying to see how mean you can be
I would do my dog better that the way you do me

[Outro ]
Pitiful
Feel so sorry for myself
Pitiful
Feel so sorry for myself
When you know that you don't want me baby
But you ain't gonna let me have nobody else now are ya

[Verse 1]
I say I'll move the mountains
And I'll move the mountains
If he wants them out of the way
Crazy, he calls me
Sure, I'm crazy
Crazy in love, I'd say

[Verse 2]
I say I'll go through fire, yes
And I will kill fire
As he wants it, so it shall be
Crazy, he calls me
Sure, I'm crazy
Crazy in love, you see

[Bridge]
Like the wind that shakes the bough
He moves me with a smile
The very difficult, I will do right now
The impossible will take a little while

[Verse 3]
And I say I'll care forever
And I really will care forever
Even if I, even if I
Even if I have to hold up the sky
Crazy, he calls me
Well, maybe, baby, maybe, I'm crazy
Sure, crazy in love am I

[Outro]
Crazy in love am I
And I will move the mountains

[Verse 1]
People say I'm the life of the party
Because I tell a joke or two
Well, although I may be laughing loud and hearty
Deep inside I'm blue

[Chorus]
So take a good look at my face
You'll see that my smile seems out of place
And if you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears

[Refrain]
I need you, need you

[Verse 2]
Since you left
If you see me with someone else
Acting like I'm having big fun
Well, although he may look fine
He's not a really man
You're the only one

[Chorus]
So take a good look at my face
You'll see that my smile seems out of place
And if you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears

[Bridge]
I'm masquerading
My hope is fading
Since you put me down
My smile is my make-up
I wear since my break up with you

[Chorus]
Baby, take just a, one good look at my face
And see that my smile seems out of place
And if you look closer, it's so easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
Oh baby, take just one look at my face
You'll see that my smile is out of place
And if you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of those tears
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh
One look at my face
You'll see that my smile seems out of place
And if you look closer...

[Verse 1]
That's life, that's what all the people say
You're riding high in April
Shot down in May
But I know I'm gonna change that tune
When I'm back on top, back on top in June
I said that's life, and as funny as it may seem
Some people get their kicks
Stomping on a dream
But I don't let it, let it get me down
Cause this fine all world it keeps spinning around

[Chorus 1]
I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate
A poet, a pawn and a queen
I've been up and down and over and out
And I know one thing
Each time I find myself, flat on my face
I pick myself up and get back in the race

[Chorus 2]
That's life
I tell you, I can't deny it

[Verse 2]
I thought of quitting baby
But my heart just ain't going to buy it
And if I didn't think it was worth one single try
I'd jump right on a big bird and then I'd fly

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
Many times I thought of cutting out
But my heart won't buy it
But if there's nothing shaking come this here July
I'm going to roll myself up in a big ball and die
My, My
Ain't nobody
(No...)
Going to turn me around no more
(No...)
Ain't nobody
(No...)
Going to turn me around
(No...)
Well I've learned my lesson and now I've see
Love ain't the thing for me
Ain't nobody
(Nobody, nobody, no...)
Don't turn me around
Turn me around
Turn me around
Turn me around

Ain't nobody

Gonna talk sweet talk to me (No...)
(No...)
Ain't nobody (No...)

Gonna tell me how sweet love can be (No...)

I'm gonna take my love and put in on the shelf
Ain't gonna give it to nobody else
Ain't nobody
(Nobody, nobody, no...) Who's gonna turn me around
(Turn me around) Turn me around
Turn me around
Turn me around (Turn me around)
Love you've been so doggone mean
You shattered every one of my dreams
And you know I can't love nobody else
But still you left me here all by myself
Turned me around
You turned me around
You turned me around
You turned me around

I've learned my lesson and now I see
Love ain't the thing for me
Ain't nobody
(Nobody, nobody, no...) Baby who's gonna turn me around

Turn me around (Turn me around)

Love, you've been so doggone mean
Love, you shattered every one of my dreams
You turn me around, stone around
You turn me around, stone around
You turn me around

[Verse 1]
If you've gotta make a fool of somebody
If you had to make a fool of someone
Tell me why did you hurt me
Because I'm the one that worries
Now, tell you I am the one who loves you truly

[Verse 2]
If you've gotta make a fool of somebody
If you've got to make a fool of anyone, yeah

Because I, I was the one, the who loved him
Oh, oh, I, I was the one who cared

Daytime, nighttime, anytime at all

Just to be with you, darling, you know
Any place you go, how could you hurt me so?
You hurt me so, yeah, you hurt me so
Oh, hurt me so

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
If you have to make a fool of somebody, yeah
If you really have to make a fool of anyone, yeah
Why, tell me why did you have to hurt me, yeah
Because I was the one, I was the one who loved you
Now, tell you that I was the one
I was the one standing by your side
I, I, I, I, I was the one, the one who really loved you, yeah
I was the one, the one who wiped your tears when you cried
Do you remember? I am the one

[Verse 1]
I have had my fun, if I don't get well no more
I want to tell you I've had big fun, if I don't get well no more
You see, my health is failing
And I'm going down slow, yes I am

[Verse 2]
Now what I want you to do for me is
Somebody write my father, tell him the shape that I'm in, oh yeah
Oh only tonight would somebody call my father
Tell him, tell him the shape that I'm in, oh yeah
And while you're talking to him
Tell him to pray for me, and tell him to forgive me, forgive me for all my sins, forgive me for my sins

[Verse 3]
Tell him that early one morning
Look for my, look for my clothes home
Tell him early one morning
Look for, to look for my clothes home, yeah
And tell him just in case, he don't see my body
All he can do, all he can do is stand there and moan
And I believe he can do it, yes he can, yeah, yes he can, yeah

[Verse 4]
Early one morning, I'm comin' on home, and I believe I'll make it there, yes I do, yes I do
I tell ya, I tell ya that early one morning, I'm goin' on home, and I believe to my soul, yeah, I'm gon' make it there, yes I do
Awww, but just in case, he don't see my body, let him know his child has gone out of this world somewhere
Right now I'm going down, oh oh, I'm going down real slow

[Verse]
It’s knowing that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk (free to walk, free to walk, free to walk, free to walk)
That makes me know that I can leave
My sleeping bag behind your couch (yes it’ll be right there)
Yes it does (yes it’ll be right there)
It’s knowing I’m not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And your ink stains that have dried upon some line
Keeps you on the back roads (back roads)
By the rivers of my memory (memory)
It keeps you ever gentle on my mind (gentle on my mind, yeah)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, oh (gentle on my mind, yeah)
It’s not clinging to some rocks and ivy planted
On some column now that binds me, no, it don’t
Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we fit together walking
We did it, baby
It’s knowing that the world will not be cursing or forgiving
When they turn around and find
That you’re moving on the back roads (back roads)
You’re still on my memory (memory)
You’re ever gentle on my mind (gentle on my mind, yeah)
Yes, I’m baby (gentle on my mind, yeah)

[Outro]
Yeah, you are gentle (gentle on my mind, yeah)
You are gentle (gentle on my mind, yeah)
You are gentle and gentle (gentle on my mind, yeah)
You are gentle on the back roads (gentle on my mind, yeah)
Yeah, yeah (gentle on my mind, yeah)
You are gentle on my mind (gentle on my mind, yeah)
Say that, babe (gentle on my mind, yeah)
You are gentle on my mind (gentle on my mind, yeah)
Yeah (gentle on my mind, yeah)
If you want my lovin'
If you really do
Don't be afraid baby
Just ask me
You know I'm gonna give it to you

Oh and I do declare (I do)
I wanna see you with it
Stretch out your arms little boy
You're gonna get it
'Cause I love you
(Baby, baby baby I love you)

Ain't no doubt about it
Baby I love you
(Baby, baby baby I love you)
I love you I love you
I love you, I love you
Baby I love you

If you feel you wanna kiss me
Go right ahead I don't mind
All you got to do is
Snap your fingers
And I'll come runnin'
I ain't lyin' (I ain't lyin')
And I heard you once
Little boy you know you got it
I'd deny my own self
Before I see you without it
'Cause I love you
(Baby, baby baby I love you)
Ain't no doubt about it
Baby I love you
(Baby, baby baby I love you)
I love you I love you

Baby I love you

Someday you might want to run away
And leave me sitting here crying
But if it's all the same to you baby
I'm gonna stop you from saying goodbye
(Goodbye)
Baby I love you

Said I want you

(Baby, baby)
Don't let you...

[Verse]
So long I hope we'll meet again
One day
And I'm hoping maybe then you'll say
Darling I found out I was wrong
So long
You leave me here to cry
It will never be goodbye
Because you been mine so long
All alone
With my memories of you
I can dream that you're lonely like me too
You're my home
Even though we're far apart
I'm gonna keep you in my heart
So long, so long baby
Gee, I really hate to see you go
Because you are all and everything in my world and you know
That you been mine all mine so long
But baby I gotta say so long

[Verse 1]
Each time I hold somebody new
My arms grow cold thinking of you
No one can take your place
Darling, in my embrace
I'll never be free

[Verse 2]
And when my lips burn with desire
No other kiss puts out the fire
Though I may try and try
No one can satisfy this longing in me

[Bridge]
I'll never be free from your smile so tender
The sweet surrender in your eyes
Tell me, how can I be free when you know I'm gonna still remember
How you thrill me, thrill me with a smile

[Verse 3]
Just like a chain bound to my heart
Your love remains, baby, when we're apart
Each kiss I gave to you
Made me a slave to you
I'll never be free

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
I'll never be free from your smile so tender
Or the sweet surrender in your eyes
Tell me, how can I be free when I still remember
How you thrill me, thrill me with a smile

[Outro]
Just like a chain bound to my heart
Your love remains, baby, whenever we're apart
Each kiss I gave to you
Made me a slave to you, yes, it did
I'll never, never, never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, never, ever, ever be free
Baby, I'll never, ever, ever, ever be free

[Intro]
To be young, gifted and black
Oh, what a lovely precious thing
Oh, when you're, yes, yes, when you're
When you're young
Yeah, thank you, Jesus
Gifted and black
Open your heart is all I need

[Verse]
In this whole world, you know
There are millions of boys and girls
Who are young, gifted and black
With their souls intact, and that's a fact
"You are young, gifted and black"
We must begin to tell our young
"There's a world waiting for you, you
Yours is the quest that's just begun"
When you're feeling real low
Here's a great truth you should remember and know
That you're young, gifted and black
You got your soul intact, oh, and that's a fact

[Outro]
You're young, gifted and black
Oh, it's a mighty sweet thing, yes, it is now
Young, gifted and black
Oh, my sisters
Young, gifted and black
You're young and you're black, you got your soul intact
You got the future, don't you know it's a fact?
Young, gifted and black
Young

[Verse 1]
To make you laugh, I would be a fool for you
Although the people turn and stare
I really don't care
I would give my everything to keep you, boy
It breaks my heart when you're not there
I'll stage a ballet on a tabletop
Command performance finger size
And although I ain't got no tune
My show ain't gonna fly
I will find the music there in your eyes

[Chorus]
Oh me, oh my, I'm a fool for you, baby (Baby, now)
Oh me oh my (Fool for you, I)
I am crazy, baby (Crazy, baby)
Oh me, oh my (Me oh my)
Yeah, I'm a fool for you, baby
Come on, let your love light shine on me (Shine on me)

[Verse 2]
We'll blow a genie from a cigarette
And then we'll take a magic carpet ride
Yes we will
And we'll tell our smoky friend, hey, don't you forget
Because you've got to keep us side by side, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh me, oh my (Me oh my)
I am a fool for you, baby (Be your)
Oh me, oh my (Fool for you, I)
You know that I am crazy (Crazy) baby, yes you do (Crazy, baby)
Oh me, oh my (Me oh my)
Oh, I'm a fool for you, baby (Fool, need your)
Come on, let your love light shine on me (Shine)
Would you do that? (On me)
Come on, let your love light shine
Just a little bit right on me (Shine on me)

[Outro]
Oh, lover let your love light
Shine on me (Shine on me)
Oh, hear me now
Oh me, me oh my
I'm a fool, oh, for you, baby (Fool now)
Oh, me oh my (I)
You know that I'm crazy, baby (Crazy, baby)
Oh me, oh my

[Intro]
Oh yeah, what'd you think was going to happen?
Come on!

[Chorus]
We gets up, everybody gets down
Make a sound, make a sound
We gets up when we come to your town

So you feel the gift
All the competition, they got to quit

[Chorus]
We gets up, everybody gets down
Make a sound, make a sound
We gets up when we come to your town

Ain't no one can stop us, how you think you could?

[Chorus]
We gets up, everybody gets down
Make a sound, make a sound
We gets up when we come to your town
I said the lost is found

[Bridge]
Yeah, NPG, New Power Soul, K-k-k-kick it!

[Chorus]
Daydreaming and I'm thinking of you
Daydreaming and I'm thinking of you
Daydreaming and I'm thinking of you
Daydreaming and I'm thinking of you
Look at my mind floating away

[Verse 1]
He's the kind of guy that would say
Hey, baby, let's get away
Let's go some place, huh
Where, I don't care
He's the kind of guy that you give your everything
You trust your heart, share all of your love
'Til death do you part
I want to be what he wants
When he wants it and whenever he needs it
And when he's lonesome and feeling love starved
I'll be there to feed it
I'm loving him a little bit more each day
Turns me right on when I hear him say

[Refrain]
Hey, baby, let's get away
Let's go somewhere far
Baby, can we
Where, I don't care
Hey, baby, let's get away
Let's go somewhere far
Baby, can we
Where, I don't care

[Verse 2]
I want to be what he wants when he wants it
And whenever he needs it
And when he's lonesome and feeling love starved
I'll be there to feed it
Loving him a little bit more each day
It turns me right on when I hear him say

[Refrain]
Hey, baby, let's get away
Let's go somewhere far
Baby, can we
Where, I don't care
Hey, baby, let's get away
Let's go somewhere far
Baby, can we
Where, I don't care

[Chorus]
Daydreaming and I'm thinking of you
Daydreaming and I'm thinking of you
Daydreaming and I'm thinking of you
Daydreaming and I'm thinking of you
Look at my love floating away

[Outro]
Daydreaming (Thinking of you)
Daydreaming (Thinking of you)

Day—

[Verse 1]
Rock steady, baby

Sit yourself down in your car and take a ride
And while you're moving rock steady
Rock steady, baby

[Chorus]
Let's call this song exactly what it is

[Verse 1]
Billy Ray was a preacher's son
And when his daddy would visit he'd come along
When they gather 'round the parlour talking
That's when Billy would take me walking
Through the back yard we'd go walking
Then he'd look into my eyes
Lord knows, to my surprise

[Chorus]
The only one who could ever reach me
(Was the son of a preacher man)
The only boy who could ever teach me
(Was the son of a preacher man)
Yes he was (Hallelujah)
Yeah, he was (Hallelujah)
Ohh, he was (Ohh Hallelujah)

[Verse 2]
Being good isn't always easy
No matter how hard I try
When he started sweet-talking to me
He keeps 'n tellin' me "Everything is all right" (Sock it to me)
Baby baby "Everything is all right"
(Ohh Sock it to me)
Can I sneak away again tonight now

[Chorus]
The only one who could ever reach me
(Was the son of a preacher man)
I tell you that the only boy who could ever teach me
(Was the son of a preacher man)
Yes he was (Hallelujah)
Yeah, he was (Hallelujah)
Ohh, he was (Haaaa)

[Verse 3]
Hmmmm
How well I remember
The look that was in his eyes
Stealing kisses from me on the sly
Taking time to make time
Telling me that he's all mine
Learning from each other's knowing
Looking to see how much we're growing

[Chorus]

[Intro]
Big white mansion
Top of the road
Latest fashion
Happy, don't you know?

[Verse 1]
Here I am in New York, yeah
See the girl bold and fair
What's in your backpack today?
Will it take my blues away?
That's OK, "you gotta run"
Huh, check it, I don't need you to have some fun
Coming from the land of snow
I guess I'm kind of used to cold

[Chorus]
But one day I'll have a big white mansion
At the top of the road
I'm going to wear the latest fashion
I'm going to be happy, don't you know?

[Verse 2]
I could use a new guitar
Sing a tune at Chazz' bar
Maybe meet a debutante
Be a toy, do what she want (Tell me what you wanna do?)
9 o'clock, see John K
"But you don't rock, come another day" (When?)
Come another day
Spirit so low reaching up for ground (Reaching up for ground)
One day I'm going to make it in this lonely town

[Chorus]
But one day I'll have a big white mansion
At the top of the road
I'm going to wear the latest fashion
I'm going to be happy, don't you know?

[Verse 3]
Hey there, what's your name? (What's your name, cutie?)
And can you tell me how to play the game? ("I am a winner") (Listen to this)
Do I really have to cut my hair? (No)
Now that's a cross I could never bear (How about them publishing rights?)
Sell my publishing? What a laugh! (Ha ha)
I don't know Bo but I do know math (I do know math)
Back to Minneapolis, there you go
You can't find your house underneath the snow

[Chorus]
Because you're living in a big white mansion (Oh yes)
At the top of the road
You're wearing the latest fashion
Trying to be happy, don't you know? (Trying to be happy, happy)

[Outro]
Big white, big white mansion (Big white mansion)
At the top of the road
You and me wearing Versace, Gucci (Latest fashion)
Hoochies, they all wanna do me (Happy, don't you know?)
But am I really happy?
Big white mansion
(Yeah, maybe one day)
("Yo, Anita!") 

[Martin sample]
("Yo, check out that ass!")

[Verse 1]
At the dark end of the street
That's where we always meet
Hiding in shadows where we don't belong
Living in darkness to hide our wrong
You and me at the dark end of the street
I know that time's going to take its toll
We have to pay for the love we stole
It's a sin and we know it's wrong
Oh but our love keeps a coming on strong
But tonight we will meet at the dark end of the street

[Chorus]
They're going to find us yes they're going to find us
They're going to find us oh some day
You and me at the dark end of the street you and me

[Verse 2]
And when the daylight roll around
And by ten we're both downtown
If we should meet you just walk right on by
Oh my darling now please don't you cry
Tonight we'll meet at the dark end of the street you and me

[Chorus]
They're going to find us yes they're going to find us
They're going to find us oh some day
You and me at the dark end of the street you and me

[Verse 1]
Turn down the lights, turn down the bed
Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me, tell me no lies
Just hold me close, don't patronize
Don't patronize me

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
I can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart (My heart) and I'll feel the power
But you won't, no, you won't

[Interlude]
Because I can't make you love me if you don't
Do you?
Do you love me?
Look at me

[Verse 2]
I'll close my eyes, then I won't see
The love you don't feel, when you're holding me (Hold me)
Morning will come and I'll do what's right (Do it right, do it right)
Just give me 'til then to give up this fight
And I will, I will give up this fight
Oh, yes I will

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't make you love me if you don't
I can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart (My heart) and I'll feel the power
But you won't, no, you won't
Tell me why, tell me why you don't?

[Bridge]
(I can't make you love me if you don't)
Come here, baby
(I can't make your heart feel something it won't)
Talk to me, tell me where you want to be kissed
Talk to me, tell me how you want me to do this
In this bedroom/church, you can guess the offering
I offer you (My heart)
I offer you sexual relations (But you won't)
But you won't (You won't)
Tell me what's up baby? Am I moving to fast?
Not only do I want to be the first
I want to be the last, the last, is that so bad?
I, I want to... you know
I want to, I want to
I want to make you love me (Do you love me?)
Come on, baby, you can take it (My heart)
(Come on and take it)
It's real love - I want to make it (I want to)
But you won't love me, love me (But you won't)
You won't love me, baby (You won't)
What's a man to do? What is this man gonna do?
I can't make you love me if you don't
I want you to (Love me) love me
I need you to (Kiss me, yeah)
Oh, darlin', love me
Love me, love me, love me

[Outro]
Turn down the lights, turn down the bed
Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me, tell me no lies
Just hold me close between your thighs
Ooh (I can't make you love me)

[Intro: Prince]
Damned if I do

[Verse 1: Prince]
Tell me what's up with the teenage indecision
I'm mad in love but you won't give me permission
You said, "Be here at nine"
Then scream at me for not giving you more time
More time

[Chorus: Prince]
Damned if I do
Damned if I don't
You say you want me to love you
But when I try, you won't
Maybe, maybe we should say goodbye
Damned if I do

[Verse 2: Prince]
Tell me the truth
How many you do it to?
I smell vermouth everytime I don't get to kiss you
Enough's enough
If you don't want my lovin' then I'll give up
I'll give up

[Chorus: Prince]
Damned if I do
Damned if I don't
You say you want me to love you
But when I try, you won't
Maybe, maybe we should say goodbye
Goodbye

[Bridge: Prince]
Damned if I don't try to make you see yourself the way I do
Open minded, worldly, always ready for taboo

[Verse 3: Prince]
Tell me what's up
Are we gonna go to heaven?
I'll fill your cup
I won't do it like Kevin

[Chorus: Prince]
Damned if I do
Damned if I don't
You say you want me to love you
But when I try, you won't
Maybe, maybe we should say goodbye
Damned if I do, damned if I don't
Baby, maybe we should say goodbye
Maybe we should say, "I do"

[Outro: Mayte and Unidentified Friend]
Tu siempre estas hablando de lo que tenemos que hacer
Bueno, tu sabes
Pero lo que tienes que hacer
Que?
Es buscarte una menta para la boca porque apestas!
Que es lo que tu estas diciendo?
Por favor... cometelas todas!
A mi no me apesta la boca!

[Verse 1]
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom (Words of wisdom)
Let it be

[Verse 2]
And when the broken-hearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer
Let it be
For though they may be parted
There is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer
Let it be

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
There will be an answer
Let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom (Whisper words of wisdom)
Let it be

[Break]

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom (Whisper words of wisdom)
Let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom (Whisper words of wisdom)
Let it be

[Verse 3]
And when the night is cloudy
There is still a light that shines on me
Shine until tomorrow
Let it be
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
There will be an answer
Let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, leave it alone, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

[Intro]
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put our two hearts together again

[Verse]
We sat on the wall of happiness
We sat on the wall of love
We sat on the wall of security so high above
With his arms all around me
It was like a fairy tale
Two people so in love
Tell me, how could it fail?

[Pre-Chorus]

Couldn't put our two hearts together again
Couldn't put our two hearts together again

[Intro: Scrap D.]
Turn off that weak jam, man
Come on, huh
Mr. Happy's here, huh, and we're bugging

[Chorus: Prince]
I will take care of you
Whatever you want, I do it right
Oh, I will take care of you
Mr. Happy every day and night, oh

[Verse 1: Prince]
I got some money, I got some juice
But somethings funny, I ain't got you
I comes to party (Yeah), don't wanna be alone
I need somebody - somebody grown

[Chorus: Prince]
I will take care of you
Whatever you want, I do it right
Oh, I will take care of you
Mr. Happy every day and night, oh

[Verse 2: Prince]
Sugarbaby, with the curly hair
Dancing crazy, underwear
Witcha name on it, looking fine ("Bought a house next to Prince") (Fine)
Keep smacking that booty and you'll be mine

[Chorus: Prince]
I will take care of you
Whatever you want, I do it right
Oh, I will take care of you
Mr. Happy every day and night, oh

[Verse 3: Scrap D.]
Pump it up, pump it up
Brown man, puffing on a weak jam
Understand this is 80 proof
Guaranteed to get your girl loose if she douche
Throw your set up to the roof, huh
Third finger down, if you're wild, make a sound
Look at my people getting on down (Get down, get down)
Skip the Remy and let me have some Mary Tyler Moore of that new power soul
Coming from the midwest passing every test with a fuzztone remote control

[Chorus: Prince]
I will take care of you
Whatever you want, I do it right
Oh, I will take care of you
Mr. Happy every day and night, oh

[Verse 4: Scrap D.]
I'll make your love come down like a freaking elevator
In the middle of the night, body vibrating like a pager
You play the drink, baby, I'll play the chaser
Do I love you? I can't love you because I hate you
See, you got this bad case of the sad face
Dinner at 8 then intercourse at my place
Keep the drapes open, VCR, the whole bit
I know it sound sick, but baby, let's make a flick
Mr. Happy, babydoll, I came to do damage (I will take care of you)
Rock your world, knock your brain to another planet
You know my North Pole can generate heat
Been thinking about me? Hmm, I can see them stains in your sheets
Before the reputation, they all used to pass me (I will take care of you)
Yeah?
Now they stop to ask me
For real?
Straight up, the lifestyle of Mr. Happy
Yeah

[Outro: Prince]
I will take care of you
Whatever you want, I do it right, oh
Mr. Happy every day and night
(Yeah)
("Microphone check")

[Verse 1]
If ever i would leave you, it wouldn't be in summer
Seeing you in summer, I never would go
Your hair streaked with sunlight, your arms red as flame
Your face with a luster that puts gold to shame

[Verse 2]
And if I'd ever leave you, it couldn't be in autumn
Just how i'd leave in autumn, I never, never would know
I've seen how you sparkle when fall nips the air
I know you in autumn and I must be there

[Bridge]
Oh would I leave you running merrily, merrily, merrily through the snow?
Or on a wintry evening when you catch the fire's glow?

[Verse 3]
If ever i would leave you, it wouldn't be in springtime
Knowing how in springtime I'm bewitched, bewitched, bewitched by you so
Oh, no, not in springtime, summer, winter, or fall
If ever i would leave, leave you at all

[Verse 1]
I pulled into Nazareth, I was feeling about half past dead
I just need some place where I can lay my head
Hey, mister, can you tell me where a girl might find a bed?
(can you tell me)
He just grinned and shook my hand, and "No," was all he said

[Chorus]
Take a load off Annie, take a load off for free
Take a load off Annie, and, and, and put the weight on me

[Verse 2]
I picked up my bag, I went looking for a place to hide
When I saw Carmen and the Devil walking side by side
I said, "Hey, Carmen, come on, let's go downtown
She said, "Well I gotta go, but m'friend can stick around

[Chorus]
Take a load off Annie, take a load off for free
Take a load off Annie, and, and, and

[Verse 3]
Go down, Moses, there's nothing that you can say
It's just like all Luke waiting, waiting on Judgement Day
Well, Luke, my friend, what about Anna Lee?
He said, Do me a favor, stay an' keep Anna Lee some company

[Chorus]
Take a load off Annie, take a load off for free
Take a load off Annie, and, and, and put the weight on me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 4]
Catch me a cannon ball, now take me on down the line
My bag is sinking low, and I believe that it's about time
To get in touch with Annie, you know she's the one
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone?

[Chorus]
Take a load off Annie, take a load off for free
Take a load off Annie, take a load off for free

[Verse 1]
To these walls I talk
Telling them what I wasn't strong enough to say
To these walls I talk
Telling them how I cried the day you went away

[Chorus]
How did we ever lose communication?
How did we ever lose each other's sound?
Baby, if you wanna, we can fix the situation
Maybe we can stop the rain from coming down

[Verse 2]
In this bed I scream
Lonely nights I lay awake thinking of you
And if I'm cursed with a dream
A thousand times I feel whatever I've put you through

[Bridge]
Tell me, how're we gonna put this back together?
How're we gonna think with the same mind?
Knowing all along that life is so much better
Living and loving together all the time
Living and loving
In this bed I, in this bed I, in this bed I scream

[Verse 3]
In this car I drive
I'm looking for the road that leads back To the soul we shared
With my very life
I'd gladly be the body upon the cross we bear
(Cross we bear)

[Chorus]
How did we ever lose communication?
How did we ever lose each other's sound?
Baby, if you wanna, we can fix the situation
Maybe we can stop the rain from coming down

[Outro]
Maybe we can't, maybe we can
Stop the rain, stop the rain
In this bed I, in this bed I, in this bed I scream
I scream
In this bed I scream

[Verse 1]
Baby, no one could have told me
How could they have told me
When they didn't know?

[Chorus]
I'd sit down and cry, baby
I'd sit down and cry, baby
Sit down and cry my heart out
Over you, oh

[Verse 2]
No one, no one could have warned me
That you would scar me yeah
And hurt me so bad

[Chorus]
And that I'd sit down and cry, baby
I'd sit down and cry, baby
I'd sit down and cry my heart out
Over you

[Verse 3]
Oh, who would ever believe?
That lips sweet as yours
Sweeter than the honey
From the bees

Tell, who would ever believe?
That those same sweet lips
Would lie, lie like
Lie like you lied to me, yeah

Baby, no one, no one could ever told me
I wouldn't hear it
That you would have sold me, yeah
Down the river so fast

[Chorus]
I'd sit down and cry, baby
I'd sit down and cry, baby
Sit down and cry my heart out
Over you, oh

And that I'd sit down and cry, baby
I'd sit down and cry, baby
I'd sit down and cry my heart out
Over you

Sex in the summer, getting it on
Give me that number, we can party all night long

[Chorus]
Sex in the summer, getting it on
Give me that number, we can party all night long
Checking for bikinis, laying in the sand
Rub it like a genie, living while we can

[Verse 1]
Afternoon in the city, somewhere in July
Policemen acting... yeah, you know, de-elevate a brother's high
The mama's in the short dress, blowing in the breeze
The papa's just a-praying for the gust that will bust that butt out, please, oh!

[Chorus]
Sex in the summer, getting it on
Give me that number, we can party all night long
Checking for bikinis, laying in the sand
Rub it like a genie, living while we can

[Verse 2]
Everybody's got a black book in case of emergency
In case the sun is shining at the beach and the honeys are out to play
The cool boys just a-watching all the pretty moves you make
Fronting in the sun, jamming for the one lover that you wanna take home

[Chorus]
Sex in the summer, getting it on
Give me that number, we can party all night long
Checking for bikinis, laying in the sand
Rub it like a genie, living while we can

[Verse 3]
Checking out Mahalia's greatest - "In The Upper Room"
When my boy Kirk calls singing
"Hope we get together soon (soon, soon)
We can fire up the Honda and pick up Rhonda
We can jam on a brand new tune
Improvise all through the night, it'll be just like having

[Chorus]
Sex in the summer, getting it on
Give me that number, we can party all night long
Checking for bikinis, laying in the sand
Rub it like a genie, living while we can

[Verse 4]
Can't you feel the new day dawning? All believers will see
An end to suffering and every disease
Every waking hour will soon be spent kissing each other
Angelic sisters and brothers
Clap your hands for one another, we'll be having

[Chorus]
Sex in the summer, getting it on
Give me that number, we can party all night long
Checking for bikinis, laying in the sand
Rub it like a genie, living while we can

[Intro]
Come here, baby
Come and get your come on

[Chorus]
Oh, I see this is what you wanted
One kiss at a time
(I got to be) I got to be up on it
If I want to make you mine

[Verse 1]
This is something every girl should know
Every part of you comes alive when you take it slow
And every nervous twitch that happens when my tongue is there
Your lips, up and down your back and every single hair
It all makes up the beauty of your grand design
Every man has got a duty, and tonight I want to do mine

[Chorus]
Oh, I see this is what you wanted
One kiss at a time
(I got to be) I got to be up on it
If I want to make you mine

[Verse 2]
This is something every man should see
Give your woman what she wants and give her what she needs
(What she needs)
(What she needs)
(What she needs)
Ask her in a whisper that only two can hear
What can I do, what can I say, baby? Forget your every single fear
Slowly I pull your strap down and touch you as if to heal (heal)
Layer by layer, inch by inch, until your true love is revealed

[Chorus]
Oh, I see this is what you wanted
One kiss at a time
(I got to be) I got to be up on it
If I want to make you mine

[Verse 3]
If every man could love their woman the way that I love you
Time would stop and the sky would fall
And all could see the glory of what true love can bring
That's what I sing
Oh, I see

[Chorus]
(Oh, I see) Mmm, this is what you wanted
One kiss at a time
I got to be on my knees, I.. I.. I.. I gotta please
If I want to make you mine

[Bridge]
Only, only, only way to get your come on, all night long
One kiss at a time (And I know that's right)
(I gotta stay) I gotta stay, 

[good and long] (Now come on)
On this Valentine

[Outro]
Come on (Come and get your come on)
Get your come on, baby
One kiss at a time
Come on, baby, let's get this on
One kiss at a time
Uh huh, yeah
One kiss at a time
One kiss at a time

[Intro]
I love you (I love you)
And I love you (I love you)

Baby will you call me the moment you get there?
Hey baby, um-hum

My dearest, my dearest of all darling (ah-ooo)
I know, I know, I know, I know we’ve got to part (ah-ooo)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
It really doesn’t hurt me that bad yeah (ah-ooo)
Because you’re taking me with you
And I’m keeping you right-a here in my heart
It’s all because I love you (I love you)
Woo-hoo, and I love you (I love you)

Call me (the moment)
The moment (you get there)
You get there? yeah, yeah, baby, yeah

[Verse 1]
Loving you in silence, knowing that it's right
Under your gaze I ponder this love tonight
Unbothered by the chaos swirling around outside
In your arms is where I want to live and die

[Chorus]
Some place where your face is all that I see
Where the love we make intoxicates intensively
In a mirror where your sweet reflection used to be
There is hope
There is joy
My soul sanctuary
My soul sanctuary

[Verse 2]
Loving you in silence, neverending kiss
Under your gaze I can peacefully exist
Sanctuary, baby, nothing compares to this
In my darkest hour you can be my bliss
(Bliss)

[Chorus]
All of me I give to thee down at your feet
The reassurance in your rhythm speaks to me
Over and over your screams are like a prayer
In the dark
You are there (you are there)
My soul sanctuary
Ooh, my soul sanctuary

[Bridge]
Loving you in passion unmolested in this garden
Mango and nectarine, sweet honeydew, I beg your pardon
My mouth runneth over from ecstasy
It's true (it's true), baby, I love the taste of you

[Verse 1]
Loving you in silence, knowing that it's right
Under your gaze I ponder this love tonight
Unbothered by the chaos swirling around outside
In your arms is where I want
I want to live and die

[Chorus]
Some place where your face is all that I see
Where the love we make intoxicates intensively
In a mirror where your sweet reflections used to be
There is hope
There is joy
My soul sanctuary
My soul sanctuary
My soul sanctuary
Oh, my soul sanctuary
Soul sanctuary

[Verse 1]
This is my same old coat
These are my same old shoes
It was the same old me
With the same old blues
Oh, then you touched my life
Just by holding my hand
When I look in the mirror
I see a brand new girl, ah, man

And I get the same old grins
But now the joke is on you
It happened somehow with you
Every day of my life
I'm as fresh as morning dew

Since I found you, baby (I'm slippin')
I got me a brand new style

April fools, April fools, April fools, April fools
April fools, April fools, April fools, April fools

[Verse 1]
In an April dream
Once you came to me
You smiled, I looked into your eyes and I knew
I'd be loving you, and
Then you touched my hand, and I knew
April dreams could come true

[Chorus]
Are we just April fools
Who can't see all the danger around us?
Are we just April fools?
I don't care, true love has found us now
(April fool, true love's found us now) Woo, yes, it has
(April fool, true love's found us now) Uh-huh

Little did we know where the road would lead
Here we are, a million miles away
From the past, traveling so fast, and
There is no turning back if our sweet April dream doesn't last

Are we just April fools (Are we just April fools?)
Who can't see all the danger around us?
Are we just April fools? (Are we just April fools?)

Who can't see all the danger around us?
Are we just April fools? (Are we just April fools?)

[Intro: Prince]
Ow, ow
Stop it, baby
Uh

[Verse 1: Prince]
You're a VIP at least to me
Come here and show me some ID
I know you're fine from head to pumps
If you were mine we'd bump, bump, bump

You're much too young to peep my stash
You're trying to write checks your body can't cash
You can't hang with this, girl, look out

[Chorus: Prince]
Lolita, you're sweeter
But you'll never make a cheater out of me
Watch out, now

[Verse 2: Prince]
Cool together, yes, I must admit
Long time ago, we'd be the shh... uh oh
Like Frank and Ava, we'd paint the town
Just on the floor, gettin' way down
Dom Perignon and caviar
The finest clothes and fancy cars
You know, one of them '56 pink Caddies, baby
Oh, look out

[Chorus: Prince]
Lolita, you're sweeter
But you'll never make a cheater out of me
No, you won't, hey, hey, hey
C'mon
Lolita

[Verse 3: Prince]
Your eyes, your mouth
Your curly hair
You're bad no doubt
I must beware
You get a brother in trouble, girl
What?

[Chorus: Prince]
Lolita, you're sweeter
But I won't mislead you
I'll feed you, if it'll please you
But then I'll say "see you"
You're a fine mama mia
But you'll never ever ever
No, you'll never ever ever
No, you'll never make a cheater out of me

Hellhounds barking around my door

Unless you want to dance

[Intro]
First snow in Kokomo

[Verse 1]
The first snow in Kokomo
Off an Indiana highway, I was on my way to Kokomo
A funny friend named Chuck slipped and bumped his head (Oops)
And as we picked him up, asked us had his nose turned red
That was the first snow in Kokomo
Kenny learning to blow his horn
I was feeling right up to it
Could it be done? Yes, I could do it
That first snow in Kokomo (First snow)
Jimmy Dee playing a bass, he was learning to play
Applegate discovered a coronet, almost right away
Reggie expecting a baby, and was Freddie kinda blue (Blue)
That was the first snow in Kokomo

[Verse 2]
Jimmy Dee has put his bass away (Put away)
And I wonder if Applegate ever learned to play
Kenny is really, really blowing his horn
And a baby named Moishe has been born (Pretty little baby)
Freddie's getting ready to make things right (Right on, Freddie)
Since that first snow, that first snow in Kokomo

[Outro]
First snow in Kokomo
First snow in Kokomo
First snow in Kokomo

[Verse]
The long and winding road that leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before It always leads me here
Leads me to your door
The wild and windy night the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears crying for the day
Why leave me standing here, let me know the way
Many times I have been alone and many times I have cried
Anyway you will never know the many ways I've tried, but
Still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here, lead me to you door

[Verse 1]
At 42,000 feet above the sea
That's where you and I first came to be
From the dust of the earth and the knowledge tree
Te amo corazón

[Verse 2]
At last I can tell you what I've known so long
My heart's been crying out to sing this song
I don't care who knows it
'Cause there's nothing wrong
Te amo corazón

[Bridge]
I'm so scared of losing you
I really don't know what I'd do
Can't bear the thought of another day apart
My heart, my heart, corazón

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Once when I first laid eyes on you
I saw heaven and earth anew
Everyone else saw my brown eyes no longer blue
Te amo corazón

[Verse 4]
At first I couldn't find the words to say
How much you changed me in every way
I just want to thank you
Each and every day
Te amo corazón

[Verse 1]
I gave my heart and soul to you, boy
Didn't I do it, baby?
Didn't I do it, baby?
I gave you the love that you never ever knew, boy
Didn't I do that, baby?
Didn't I do that, baby?

[Pre-Chorus]
I've cried so many times and that's no lie (I've cried so many times and that's no lie)
It seems to make you laugh each time I cry (It seems to make you laugh each time I cry)
Baby, can you dig it?

[Chorus]
Didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I?
(Yes you did, yes you did, yes you did)
And tell me, didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I?
(Yes you did, yes you did, yes you did)

[Verse 2]
I thought that love of yours was true, boy
Didn't I think that, baby?
You know that I thought that, baby
But this time I am really leavin' you, boy
Don't you know that, baby?
I know you know that, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Ten times or more, I've walked out that door (Ten times or more, you walked out the door, yes you did)
But just be sure you get it straight this time, baby, there won't be no more
Baby, can you dig it?

[Chorus]
And didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I?
(Yes you did, yes you did, yes you did)
Oh, oh, didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I?
(Yes you did, yes you did, yes you did)

[Bridge]
(Didn't I do it to you?) Didn't I do it?
(Didn't I do it to you?) Didn't I do it?
(Didn't I put it on you?) Didn't I do it? Didn't I do it?
(Didn't I do it to you?) Didn't I do it?
(Didn't I do it to you?) Hey, didn't I do it?
(Didn't I put it on you?) Didn't I, didn't I?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, how many times did I walk out that door? (Ten times or more, you walked out the door, yes you did)
(But just be sure you get it straight this time, baby, there won't be no more)
Baby, can you dig it?
Baby, can you dig it?

[Chorus]
Didn't I blow your mind this time, baby, didn't I?
(Yes you did, yes you did, yes you did)
Oh, didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I?
(Yes you did, yes you did, yes you did)

[Outro]
Now, didn't I blow your mind this time, didn't I?
Blow your mind this time, didn't I? (Oh yeah)
Blow your mind this time, didn't I?
Blow your mind this time, didn't I?

Hanging down from my window those are my wind chimes
(Wind chimes, wind chimes, wind chimes)
In the late afternoon you're hung up on wind chimes
(Wind chimes, wind chimes, wind chimes)

[Section 2]
Though it's hard I try not to look at my wind chimes
(Wind chimes, wind chimes, wind chimes)
Now and then, a tear rolls off my cheek...

[Section 1]
On a warm breeze the little bells, tink-a-lin wind chimes
(Wind chimes, wind chimes, wind chimes)
Close your eyes and lean back, listen to wind chimes
(Wind chimes, wind chimes, wind chimes)

[Section 2]
It's so peaceful, close to a lullaby

[Instrumental Break]

[Section 3]

Whisperin' wind send my wind chimes a-tink-a-lin
Whisperin' wind send my wind chimes a-tink-a-lin
Whisperin' wind send my wind chimes a-tink-a-lin

[Verse]
There’s a place for us
Somewhere there is a place for us
Peace and quiet and open air
It waits for us somewhere
There is a time for us
I know that there is a time for us
Time together with just a little bit of time to spare
Time to learn, oh, time to care
Somewhere
We’ll find a new, a new way of living
We’ll find a way of forgiving
Somewhere
There is, there is a place for us
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
There is a place for us
Hold my hand and we’re halfway there
Hold on to my hand and I’ll, I’ll take you there
Someday, some, somewhere
I’ll take you somewhere

[Intro]
I got a call the other day
It was my sister Carolyn, saying
"Aretha, come by when you can
I've got something that I wanna say"

[Bridge]
And when I got there, she said
"You know, rather than go through a long drawn out thing
I think the melody on the box will help me explain"

[Chorus]
Gotta find me an angel
To fly away with me
Gotta find me an angel
Ooh, and set me free

[Verse]
My heart is without a home
I don't want to be alone
I gotta find me an angel
In my life, in my life
Too long have I loved
So unattached within
So much that I know
That I need somebody so
So I will just go on
Hoping that I find me someone
Gotta find me an angel in my life
In my life, in my life
I know there must be someone
Somewhere for me
Oh, I lived too long
Without the love of someone
And there's no misery
Ooh, ooh, like the misery
I feel in me

[Chorus]
I gotta find me an angel in
In my life
(You'll meet him, now don't you worry)
In my life
(Keep looking and just keep cooking)
In my life
(He'll be there, now don't you worry)
In my life
The sister from Texas
Who's been many places
That's who I am

Don't get yourself uptight
Just trying to please me
I'm down with the flame

"Here for the moment, gone forever"
"Here for the moment, gone forever"
"Here for the moment, gone forever"
Said the sister from Texas

Hard luck nights just like I see
I don't try to color it over with rose
Do you know that pride can kill ya?
I don't try to spike my pains with my nose
"People are: Here for the moment, gone forever"
"Here for the moment, then we're gone forever"
"Here for the moment, gone forever"
Said the sister from Texas
I've seen 'em come and go
For as long as I been here
Yeah! There just ain't very much more now
That can make me cry
Yeah, yeah!
Woman was born to love
And to lose man and vice versa
There's just one more thing I gotta get up to
And that's the real, that I was born to die

Yeah, yeah, hey, hey
But I'm in there fighting everyday
Because I got a few more dreams in me
Yes I have!
And I wonder will the day come when every man
With a heartbeat will knows that he's free?

"Yeah, people are: Here for the moment"
"Then they're gone forever"
"(Forever) Here for the moment"
"(Forever) Gone forever"
"(Forever) Here for the moment"
(Forever) Then they're gone forever"
Said the sister from Texas

"Yeah, here for the moment"
"(Forever) Gone forever"
"(Forever) Here for the moment"
"(Forever) Gone forever"
"(Forever) Here for the moment"
"(Forever) Gone forever"
Said the sister from Texas
"Yeah, here for the moment"
"Gone forever"
"(Forever) Here for the moment"
"(Forever) Gone forever"
"(Forever) Here for the moment"
"(Forever) Gone forever"
Said the sister from Texas

"Here for the moment"
"Gone forever"
"(Forever) Here for the moment"
"(Forever) Gone forever"
"(Forever) Here for the moment"
"(Forever) Gone forever"
Said the sister from Texas

[Intro: Prince and Támar Davis]
Baby ooh
Yes
Let's go

[Verse 1: Prince and Támar Davis]
I've been waiting for you baby all night long
I've been waiting for you baby all night long
So I could get somebody to play this song
Come on
The jam has got a beat like it's making love
The jam has got a beat like it's making love
'Cause your the only one I've been thinking of
Oh yeah
Whoa

[Chorus: Prince and Támar Davis]
Come into my room of incense and candles
I've got something that you won't know how to handle
You can tell me nuh-uh but you know how this man do
I'ma want it all night long

[Post-Chorus: Támar Davis & Prince]
Come on, come on
I want it all night long

[Verse 2: Prince and Támar Davis]
I'm glad we're compatible, mature and grown
Mature and grown
'Cause this is not something you can do alone
Oh, there's a dance floor, but we can use a table
(Yes we can)
I've gotta have a partner that's willing and able
Willing and able

[Chorus: Prince and Támar Davis]
Come into my room of incense and candles
I've got something that you won't know how to handle
You can tell me nuh-uh but you know how this man do
I'ma want it all night long

[Bridge 1: Prince and Támar Davis]
Once you try to seduce me, it grows and grows
Your mind will never deny what your body knows
I know you want to take off all your clothes
But please don't do it

[Verse 3: Prince and Támar Davis]
I got a cool idea, my darling, let's go outside
I wanna smother you with something shiny as the rims upon my ride
I wanna look for the milky way and, uh, when I find it
I'm going to make you scream my name as if it was divine
(Prince)
But we both know that we gotta praise the one who made ya
Give props to your mama for the healthy food she must have gave ya
For the meek at heart these words they might sound like a sinner
But the truth is that you're sitting on every one of your dinners
But that's fine, 'cause I'm blind
About blind as a cat in the dark
It might come to in the morning after roaming in the park
Hard to understand always changing plans
Harder than hell to handle
One scent alone make it worth your while the price of Prince's candle

[Bridge 2: Prince and Támar Davis]
All night
Circles of flowers or pyramids of sand
Violet colored diamonds
You got to understand
Incense and candles
Wherever you can
You got to make this woman
Lust for this man

[Chorus: Prince and Támar Davis]
Come into my room of incense and candles
I've got something that you won't know how to handle
(Come on, come on)
You can tell me na-uh but you know how this man do
I'ma want it all night long
(All night long)
Come into my room of incense and candles
I've got something that you won't know how to handle
(Come on, come on)
You can tell me na-uh but you know how this man do
I'ma want it all night long
(Oooh)
Come into my room of incense and candles
I've got something that you won't know how to handle
You can tell me na-uh but you know how this man do
I'ma want it all night long
(All night long)
Come into my room of incense and candles
I've got something that you won't know how to handle
(Come on, come on)
You can tell me na-uh but you know how this man do
I'ma want it all night long

[Verse 1]
I can feel your blackness, and your manhood, and your love
I can touch your whiteness, and your oranges, and your power

[Chorus]
Spain (Spain)
Yes, Mister Spain (Spain)
They going to put a star beside your name
Yes, they are, Mister Spain

[Verse 2]
I can speak your own language - if you listen, you will hear
I understand your crying, I understand your fear
And I know that you're lonely (Lonely), yes, I do (Yes, I do...)
And I know what you're missing (Missing) - baby, you do, too

[Chorus]
Mister Spain
No, don't do that, Mister Spain
Don't you put another needle in your vein, oh
Mister Spain, please

[Verse 3]
I can feel it raining on your secrets and your dreams
And I understand your reasons, and I know what you mean
Yes I do, yes I do, yes I do

[Chorus]
Spain (Spain)
Please, Mister Spain (Spain)
Don't you let nobody's daughter feel your shame
(I love you, Mister Spain)
Your shame, your shame, Mister Spain
(I love you, Mister Spain, ooh, ooh)

[Bridge]
Spain, Spain, Spain

[Verse 4]
I can feel your blackness, and your manhood, and your love
I can touch your whiteness, and your oranges, and your power
So let me hear your laughter, right away
You can turn around now, it's okay

[Outro]
Mister Spain
Ooh, Mister Spain
They're going to put a star beside your name
Laugh, laugh, Mister Spain
Laugh, Mister Spain
Whoa-oh, laugh, Mister Spain
Laugh, Mister Spain
Laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh, oh, Mister Spain
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, oh-oh oh-oh-oh-whoa

[Verse 1]
Don’t play that song for me
Cause it brings back memories
Of days that I once knew
The days that I spent with you
Oh no! Don’t let them play it (oh no!)
It fills my heart with pain (it hurts!)
Please stop it right away
'Cause I remember just a’ what he said

[Chorus]
He said, darling (darling I, I love you)
And I know that he lied (darling I, I love you)
You know that you lied (darling I, I love you)
You know that you lied (you lied)
Lied (you lied)
You lied (to me)

[Verse 2]
Hey mister, don’t play it no more
Don’t play it no more
I can’t stand it
Don’t play it no more (no more)
No more (no more)
No more (can’t stand it)
I remember on our first date
He kissed me and he walked away
I was only seventeen
I never dreamed he’d be so mean

[Chorus]
He told me darling (darling, I love you)
Baby, baby, you lied (darling, I need you)
You, you lied (darling, i love you)
You know that you lied (you lied)
Lied (you lied)
Lied, lied (to me)

[Outro]
O-o-oh darling (darling, I love you)
You know that you lied, yeah (darling, I need you)
You know i know you lied (darling, I love you)
Darling, you lied (you lied)
You lied (you lied)
You lied. You’re all that i need. You lied (to me)
O-u-o-o-o-oh, you lied (don’t play it no more)
Hey baby don’t play it no more (wo-o-oh, don’t play it no more)
Don’t do it. Don’t play it no more (wo-o-oh, for me)
No more (for me)
I can’t stand it no more (don’t play it no more)
Ouh! Hey! Don’t play it no more (wo-o-oh, don’t play it no more)

[Verse 1]
If you get anything out of life
You got to put up with the toils and strife
Ooh, well just pushed our love a little bit too far
We forgot to remember how blessed we were, now
And the girl over there telling me what she sees
You don't have to worry, baby
She ain't going to get next to me
Yes, she don't mean a thing at all
And I thought it over, yes I did

[Chorus]
That's the way that I feel about you, baby
That's the way that I feel about you, baby
That's the way that I feel about you, baby
That's the way that I feel about you, baby, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
I know you've been hurt just like many others too
But that's the sacrifice that life is gonna put us all through
Trust in me, I'll trust in you and have no fear
Sometimes, I look at you, baby and wonder if God sent you here
And I thought it over, yes I did, well, well, well, well

[Chorus]
That's the way that I feel about you, baby
And I hope you don't mind if I get weak and cry for you sometimes
That's the way that I feel about you, baby
That's the way that I feel about you, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Please, please, please, babe, if you hear my love knocking at your door
Open up, boy, because the world ain't giving up much out here no more
I know you've been hurt, so have many others too
All we gotta do is look back over the years, shine through
Shine through the light and put us all through, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Ah, that's the way that I feel about you, baby
That's the way that I feel about you in my heart for you, baby
Yeah, yeah, that's the way, that's the way, that's the way
Ah, that's the way I feel about you, baby

[Bridge]
I get a little weak now and I cry sometimes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't mind, I don't mind
I love you baby, love you baby, love you baby, love you baby, yeah

[Outro]
That's the way I feel, let me just talk about it a little while
You'll see right now, that's the way that I, that's the way that I
That's the way that I, that's the way that I, that's the way
Yeah, that's the way, that's the way, that is the way, oh
I feel about you, baby
That's the way that I, that's the way I
That's the way that I, that's the way I, oh
That's the way that I, I feel about you, baby, ooh, baby
Think about you all the time and I'm so glad
I'm so glad, I'm so glad, I'm so glad, so glad, I'm so glad
So glad to know you're my love now, baby
Stay my baby, say you gonna do that for me, sure
Say you gonna do that for me now that I have been alone
Let me know that that's the way
Let me know that that's the way
That you'd be, that you'd be always true
The way I feel...

[Verse 1]
I have had my fun if I never get well no more
I have had my fun if I never get well no more
All of my health is failing
Lord, I'm going down slow

[Verse 2]
I'm going down slow
Please write my father and tell her the shape I'm in
Please write my father and tell her the shape I'm in
Tell him to pray for me
Forgive me for my sin
For all of my sin

[Verse 3]
Early one morning, look for my clothes back home
Early one morning, look for my clothes back home
'Cause all of my health is failing
Lord, I'm going down slow
All he can do is moan

[Bridge]
All of my health is failing
Lord, I'm going down slow
I'm going down slow

[Verse 4]
Early one morning, I'm coming home and I believe that Im gonna make it there
Early one morning, I'm coming home and I believe that Im gonna make it there
If he doesnt see my body
Lord, I'm going down slow

[Verse 1]
Everyone knew but me, that soon
You would be calling it off and gone
Everyone pitied me, had so much sympathy
They didn't think i'd be strong

[Chorus]
Oh, i'm... oh, i'm pulling on... (pulling!)
Yeah! (moving!) i'm moving on
(I'm... Pulling!) pulling on! (moving!) pulling on in

[Verse 2]
If i'd meant to you what you lead me to believing
Baby, you wouldn't be gone, no
Turned your back on me (freezing!)
Just as cold as you can be... (yeah!)
I ain't been sitting here all alone

[Chorus]
Baby, cause i'm... hey, I'm pulling on... (pulling!)
Yeah... (moving!) and I'm moving
(I'm... Pulling!) oh, yes I am! (moving!) moving on
(Pulling! pulling! pulling! Pulling!)

[Bridge]
I'm pulling harder and harder
I'm moving higher and higher
I'm pulling harder and harder

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm... (pulling!) I'm pulling on! (moving!) moving on in
(I'm... pulling!) pulling on! (moving) moving!

[Verse 3]
So glad i'm free, found a man for me
Let me tell you while you're moving on:
Instead of begging you
I should have helped you pack your bags
And move along! Oh, cause

[Chorus]
Oh, cause i'm... (pulling!) pulling on... (moving!) moving on in!
(I'm... pulling!) oh, oh, no! (moving!) moving

[Outro]
(Moving! Higher! pulling! Harder!)
(Moving!) higher! (higher!) moving!
(Pulling!) pulling! (harder!) harder!
(Moving!) pulling! (higher!) higher!
(Pulling!) pulling! (harder!) harder!
(Moving!) pulling! (higher!) higher!
(Pulling!) moving! (harder!) harder!
(Moving!) pulling! (higher!) higher!
(Pulling!) moving! (harder!) harder!

(Pulling!) well

[Verse]
There I go, there I go, there I go
There I go
Pretty baby, you are the soul who snaps my control
Such a funny thing but every time you're near me
I never can behave
You give me a smile and then I'm wrapped up in your magic
There's music all around me, crazy music
Music that keeps calling me so very close to you
Turns me your slave
Come and do with me any little thing you want to
Anything baby, just let me get next to you
Am I insane or do I really see heaven in your eyes?
Bright as stars that shine up above you in the clear blue skies
How I worry about you
Just can't live my life without you
Baby come here, don't have no fear
Oh, is there a wonder why
I'm really feeling in the mood for love?
So tell me why stop to think
About this weather, my dear?
This little dream might fade away
There I go talking out of my head again, oh baby
Won't you come and put our two hearts together?
That would make me strong and brave
Oh when we are one, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
If there's a cloud up above us
Go on and let it rain
I'm sure our love together will endure a hurricane
Oh my baby
Won't you please let me love you
And give a relief from this awful misery?
What is all this talk about loving me, my sweet?
I am not afraid, not anymore, not like before
Can't you understand me?
Now baby, please pull yourself together, do it soon
My soul's on fire, come on and take me
I'll be what you make me, my darling, my sweet
Oh baby, you make me feel so good
Let me take you by the hand
Come let us visit out there
In that new promised land
Maybe there we can find
A good place to use a loving state of mind
I'm so tired of being without
And never knowing what love's about

[Bridge]
James Moody, you can come on in man
And you can blow now if you want to

[Outro]
We're through

[Chorus]
(You and me) will always be joined together for eternity
(You and me) will always be joined together for eternity

[Verse 1]
We've got each others love and understanding
And that's what it takes to make love grow
We've got our strength, and our love for all mankind
But most of all, we've got peace of mind
I know people are gonna try and knock us down
But we're gonna be strong, ain't going let nobody turn us around

[Chorus]
(You and me) will always be joined together for eternity, yeah, now
(You and me) will always be joined together for eternity

[Verse 2]
You know temptation, it works on us too
But we're too strong to let it get us down
I've got your love, baby, and you've got mine
And the lord knows we're gonna be together 'til the end of time, hey, hey
I know people are gonna try to knock us down
But we're gonna be strong, ain't going let nobody turn us around, oh!

[Chorus]
(You and me) will always be joined together for eternity
(You and me) will always be joined together for eternity
(You and me) will always be joined together for eternity
(You and me) will always be joined together for eternity

[Intro: Prince]
Ooh
Ooh
Ow!
Uh

[Verse 1: Prince & Támar Davis]
Stop telling me what you want me to hear
Stop telling me what you want me to fear
Stop trippin' on something you overheard
Love is winning without a word
Stop giving me your wish list
Love is free from all this

[Chorus: Prince & Támar Davis]
Like a bird flyin' over the hilltops
Love is like the sky, you know it never stops
From the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks
Love is whatever, whatever, you want it to be

[Verse 2: Prince & Támar Davis]
Love is not a game you can play on the floor
You gotta stop keepin' score
If you wanna, If you wanna play me like you did before
You better stop and walk out the door
You can skate around the issue if you like
But who's gonna get you high in the middle of the night?

[Chorus: Prince & Támar Davis]
Like a bird flyin' over the hilltops
Love is like the sky, you know it never stops
From the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks
Love is whatever, whatever, you want it to be

[Post-Chorus: Prince]
I see you standing with your back on the wall
You better, better get your hands up and clap if that's all
And, uh, if you don't wanna get yours, then let me get mine
See, ain't gonna be no drama 'cause we have a good time

[Verse 3:Prince & Támar Davis]
What's the point of giving me ultimatums?
Smiling at my friends when you really hate 'em
Trying to convince me that I should too
What's the point?

Stop worryin' about what people say
When it ain't gonna stop 'em anyway
Love can do anything if you try
Come on, spread your wings and let's fly, fly so high

[Chorus: Prince & Támar Davis]
Flyin' over the hilltops
Love is like the sky, you know it never stops
From the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks
Love is whatever, whatever, whatever

[Chorus: Prince & Támar Davis]
Like a bird flyin' over the hilltops
Love is like the sky, you know it never stops
From the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks
Love is whatever, whatever, you want it to be
Whatever you want it to be
Whatever you want it to be
Whatever you want it to be
Alright
Let's skate

[Post-Chorus: Prince]
Uh
C'mon
I see you standing with your back on the wall
Better get your hands up and clap if that's all
If you don't wanna get yours, then let me get mine
Ain't gonna be no drama 'cause we have a good time
Bounce
Aww, shake that thing, c'mon
Ahh, bounce it baby
Aww, shake that thing c'mon
Good god

[Verse 1]
One more time you hurt me
You thought you you had your victory
One more reason for you to worry
Cause you got the best of me
You should never count your chickens
Before you eggs get hatched
I believe it, mm, to my soul
You finally met your match
Tell me now

[Chorus]
When this battle is over
Who will wear the crown
When this battle is over

[Intro]
That's all, that's all I want from you
That's all, that's all I want from you
That's all, that's all I want from you
That's all, that's all I want from you

[Verse 1]
All i want is a little bit of love that slowly grows and grows, (slowly, slowly...)
Not one that comes and goes - that's all I want from you... (still!)
A sunny day with hopes up to the sky
A kiss, and no goodbyes,  that's all I want from you...
Don't let me down, oh, show me that you care;
Remember when you give, you always get your share...
Don't let me down, I have no time to waste;
Tomorrow may not come (may not come!), when dreamers dream (may not come!) too late...

[Chorus]
A little love that slowly grows and grows, (slowly, slowly...)
Not one that comes and goes, that's all I want from you...

[Verse 2]
Don't let me down! Show me that you care!
Remember when you give, you always get your share...
Don't let me down, i have no time to waste;
Tomorrow may not come... (may not come!) dreamers dream... (may not come!) late...

[Chorus]
A little love that slowly grows and grows, (slowly, slowly...)
Not one that comes and goes - that's all i want from you... (still!)

[Outro]
Baby, that's all! (that's all, that's all i want from you...)
Baby! (that's all, that's all i want from you...)
(That's all, that's all i want from you...)
Ooh, baby! (that's all, that's all i want from you... Slowly, slowly...)

[Verse 1]
When my friends told me you had someone new
I didn't believe a single word was true
I showed them all I had a faith in you
I just kept on saying

[Chorus]
Oh, no, not my baby
Oh, no, not my sweet baby
You're not like those other guys
Who lead you on and tell you lies

[Verse 2]
My mama told me when rumors spread
There's truth somewhere and I should use my head
But I didn't listen to what she said
I kept right on saying

[Chorus]
Oh, no, not my baby
Oh, no, not my sweet baby
You're not like those other boys
Who play with hearts like they were toys

[Verse 3]
Well, you might have had a last minute fling
But I am sure it didn't mean a thing
'Cause yesterday you gave me your ring
And i'm so glad that i kept on saying

[Chorus]
Oh, no, not my baby
Oh, no, not my sweet baby
You're not like those other guys
Who lead you on and tell you lies

[Outro]
Oh, no, not my baby
Oh, no, not my sweet baby
Oh, no, not my sweet baby

[Verse 1]
Before we get started
Are we all alone?
'Cause I'm about to get open-hearted
It's time to send your company home and turn off your cell phone
Baby, can't you see, I just wanna get you satisfied
(Satisfied)

[Verse 2]
This is gonna be a long night (Long)
A little bit longer afternoon (Afternoon)
Girl, if we get this thing right (Ooh)
Ooh, you gonna get satisfied real soon
(Can't you see) Baby, can't you see I'm just trying
That I wanna get you satisfied
(Satisfied)

[Bridge]
I ain't talking about nothing physical
'Cause foreplay starts in the mind (In the mind)
I'm just tryin' to get you to think about doing things
That you've always wanted but could never find

[Verse 3]
I'm going to seek this thing like a buried treasure (Seek)
Like Columbus sailing over the sea (and destroy)
Until I discover the land beyond expertise and chastity, ooh
I'm just trying, trying, I'm just trying to get you satisfied
(Satisfied)
(Satisfied)

[Outro]
I'm sure you had another lover (Another lover)
Well, let me tell you baby, all tricks aside
I can get you out of your body
Have you ever felt like you were dying and felt satisfied?

[Verse 1]
You must have heard it on the news this morning
"Congratulations! A new star is born!"
Sun to his shadow, rose to a thorn
But there ain't no fury like a woman scorned

[Verse 2]
Y'all must have dug it, when you did your thing
It's like a song, everybody wanna sing
When the music's over, your ears ring
With a voice that says, "Queen got no King"
Got no King

[Bridge]
He got a message saying, you tried to reach him on the phone
He didn't want to answer 'cause he's so afraid
You'd probably tell him just to leave you alone

[Verse 3]
I bet you heard he got another band
They're making money, they're making plans
You feel left out but you need to understand
Word on the street: he's still your man
He's still your man
He's still your man, girl

[Verse 4]
Look out, here comes your rainy day
Now you think you got a good reason to say
Everything that's in your heart, come what may
Even though his might get broken

[Verse 5]
Who's the guilty one when there ain't no judge or jury?
Shadow to the sun, next to the one
Hell ain't got no fury

[Verse 6]
Will the roses the dead keep sending
Repair the heart in need of mending
Will this song have a happy ending?
Only the woman knows, only she knows

[Verse 7]
Two sides to every story
One man's gloom, another man's glory
Sun to his shadow, rose to a thorn
Ain't no fury like a woman scorned

Oh no
Ain't no fury like a woman scorned
Oh no
Ain't no fury like a woman scorned
No fury like a woman scorned

[Verse 1]
Sweet, sweet bitter love
The taste still lingers
Going through my, my helpless fingers
You slipped away

[Verse 2]
Sweet, sweet bitter love
What joy you taught me
What pain you brought me
So short a stay

[Chorus]
My magic dreams have lost their spells
Where there was hope
There's an empty shell

[Verse 3]
Oh, sweet sweet bitter love
Why have you awaken
And then forsaken
A trusting heart like mine

[Chorus]
My magic dreams have lost their spells
Where there was hope
There's an empty shell

[Verse 4]
Sweet, sweet, sweet bitter love
Why have you awaken
And then forsaken
A trusting heart like mine
A trusting heart like mine

[Verse]
In a room full of harlots and fantasy
Destiny beckoned us there
Curious child on the balcony
We took the dare
Careless I was to caress thee
Yet never regretting the time
The joy that we shared, it was meant to be
And not a crime
No, it's not a crime
If memory serves us, we will align
To the truth that we most often share
Curious child, you are on my mind
Do you care?

[Verse 1]
I may get weary
Women do get weary
Wearing the same shabby dress
But to one who's weary
Try a little, try a little tenderness, oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
I may be waiting
Just anticipating
All of the things I may never possess
Mmm, but while I'm waiting
Try a little, try a little tenderness

[Bridge]
Now I may be, I may be sentimental
But I wanna say that I've had my griefs, oh, and I've had my cares
And just a good word, soft and gentle
Makes it, makes it easier, easier to bear

[Outro]
Now I might regret it
Oh, but don't let me forget it
Love's all my whole, whole happiness
Mmm, but it's so, so easy
Try a little, oh, try a little tenderness
Tender, tender, tenderness

[Verse 1]
What is this new exaltation
That I just can't explain?
What are these new inspirations
That I can't get outta my brain?

How am I going to sleep with this feeling
Rushing all through my veins?
Get up, come on let's do something
Don't you wanna go get saved?

[Verse 2]
The night is calling you to act
Act upon every urge
You can't get no satisfaction
If you ain't got the courage

I don't know what you're afraid of
I don't know what you've heard
Get up, come on let's do something
Don't you wanna know the word?

[Chorus]
Who's going to save us when them spiders get next to you?
Spinning their sticky webs around what you do
We gotta safeguard against forked tongue
And the treachery of the wicked one
Get up, come on let's do something

[Verse 3]
Don't matter how far you have to
The truth has got to be told
Don't matter how shiny your lips
They'll never be streets of gold

They might try to get us crazy
'Cause they don't know what I've heard
We got this new exaltation
I'm talking about the word

[Chorus]
Who's going to save us when them spiders get next to you?
Spinning their sticky webs around what you do
We gotta safeguard against forked tongue
And the treachery of the wicked one
Get up, come on let's do something

[Outro]
Get up, come on let's do something
No reason to feel this pain
Get up, come on let's do something
Come on, go, let's get saved
Get up, come on let's do something
No reason to feel this pain
Get up, come on let's do something
Come on, go, let's get saved
Get up, come on let's do something
Get up, come on let's do something
Get up, come on let's do something
Get up, come on let's do something
Don't you want to hear the word?

[Intro]
Ooh aah ooh
Ooh aah ooh

[Verse 1]
The email left so clearly upon a computer screen
Read like a threat that crept into her like a sex machine
Wanted: any woman who's first name begins with a "Z"
From the sound of the keys, a pawn makes a move
Her reply brings on the groove

[Chorus]
W-w-w-dot-emale-dot-com
The king takes the pawn
W-w-w-dot-emale-dot-com
It's on, it's on, it's on

[Verse 2]
He couldn't wait to tell her until after he got the nail'er
Her love would only even the score
It seemed her darling fella
He stole a hella lot of bucks from the corner store
The declaration of war that followed
She never believed, oh
In the darkest corners where widows mourn
That's where he whispered her name
He said, "We can do it here, my dear
But I fear your tears will fall like rain"
(They fall like)
"Because I must tell you
(Tell you)
While I'm deep in your smell
You got the man I want to inflict with pain
I'm running a game with my paper
I'm turning the boy to vapor
Now I wanna do the same to you
If you don't tattoo my name upon your train"

[Chorus]
W-w-w-dot-emale-dot-com
The king takes the pawn
W-w-w-dot-emale-dot-com
It's on, it's on, it's on
W-w-w-dot-emale-dot-com
The king takes the pawn
W-w-w-dot-emale-dot-com
It's on, it's on, it's on

[Outro]
It's on

[Spoken Intro]
If the wind blew every petal from your precious red rose
Would you be afraid of what you'd find inside?

[Chorus]
When I'm alone in my room
I can't stop dreaming about you, dreaming about you
When I'm alone in my room
I can't stop dreaming about you, dreaming about you
And every time I do what I need to do
I can't stop dreaming about you, dreaming about you

[Verse 1]
Revolving around every word that is spoken
Like the planets around the sun
I want you
Your tongue is a great persuader
Yeah, you got me sold
And when I'm alone in my room just watching a rose
I dream about you, I dream about you

[Chorus]
When I'm alone in my room
I can't stop dreaming about you, dreaming about you
When I'm alone in my room
I can't stop dreaming about you, dreaming about you
And every time I do what I need to do
I can't stop dreaming about you, dreaming about you

[Verse 2]
When my sane twin reigns
Claiming your aim is to maim my subconscious into being with you
I dream about you
Betting on the notion that if my lustier twin prevails
Like the ruins of Rome, I'll lie helpless at your feet
Yeah, when I'm alone
I dream about you, I dream about you

[Bridge]
I dream about you, baby
When I'm alone in my room
I dream about you, my baby
I dream about you, you, you

[Outro]
(And here we stand)
And here we stand amidst your core (you)
Like the petals on this rose I adore (you)
The inside (The inside)
If the inside is kind
Kind in a sense that one would come from all
And the wish that you wish will come true if you call
But if not, (you will fall) you will fall
And I'll still be alone (Just dreaming about you)
With this ball in my stomach just dreaming about you (Dreaming about you)

[Intro: Támar Davis and Prince]
Wake up
You're beautiful, loved, and blessed
You feel me?
I think I do

[Verse 1: Támar Davis and Prince]
When you found me I was just a piece of clay
I was formless, you gave me a new name
With the breath of life I now live abundantly
All I needed was the potter's hand
And the blood on Calvary

But too much power
Can sometimes turn to shame
Too much desire
Sometimes makes you feel the same (Come on)
But forgiveness is how you win the game
I begged for truth, now I know the truth
And that is when you came and said I was

[Chorus: Támar Davis & Prince]
Beautiful, loved and blessed
I'm better than the day before
'Cause you made me confess that I am
Beautiful, loved and blessed
When you're free, you're really free indeed
All you gotta do is just plant the seed

[Verse 2: Prince & Támar Davis]
A constant battle to stay ahead of the game
Is anybody famous when everybody wants fame?
Always trying to break you down thinkin' that it'll raise 'em up
I just wanna be happy, come, take this bitter cup from me

If I were to ever write down my life story
I could truly say with all the fame and glory
I was just a piece of clay in need of the potter's hand
'Cause when you whispered in my ear
The words I so now understand, oh

[Chorus: Támar Davis & Prince]
Beautiful, loved, and blessed
I'm better than the day before
'Cause you made me confess that I am
Beautiful, loved, and blessed
When you're free, you're really free indeed
All you gotta do is just plant the seed

[Bridge: Támar Davis]
Everything you made you said, "That's good"
Before the fall of man you said, "That's good"
Every time I walk in faith, that's good
You let me see another day, that's good

Before the Earth was made you said "Támar
I will lead the way and you'll go far"
Knowledge and understanding
Understanding is good
And when I wake up in the morning
All I hear in my hood is people saying that they're

[Chorus: Támar Davis & Prince]
Beautiful, loved, and blessed
Will you rescue me from the darkness?
And now I just must confess
That I am beautiful, loved, and blessed
Oh, when you're free you're free indeed
All you gotta do is just plant the seed

[Post-Chorus: Támar Davis]
Hey, hey, hey
Wake up, it's a new day
Hey, hey, hey
Wave your hands in the air and say
Hey, hey, hey
Wake up it's a new day
Hey, hey, hey
Wave your hands in the air and say

[Chorus: Támar Davis & Prince]
Beautiful, loved, and blessed
You rescued me from the
Darkness in the wilderness
That's why I am beautiful, loved, and blessed
No matter what the challenge
I'll always pass the test

[Outro: Támar Davis & Prince]
That's why I am
That's why I am
That's why I am
I don't mean to put nobody down
Still I must confess that I am
Beautiful, oh
When you wanna give up
Don't 'cause you know
You've always got a friend
That's why I am
That's why I am
That's why I am
Beautiful, beautiful
That's why I am
That's why I am
That's why I am
Beautiful, beautiful
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful

[Intro: Prince]
If you want to we can kick it, baby, joint to joint

[Chorus: Prince]
(Sex me) - Uh, yeah (Safe), joint to joint
(Sex me) - Uh, yeah (Safe), kick it, baby, joint to joint
(Sex me) - Uh, yeah (Safe), joint to joint
(Sex me) - Uh, yeah

[Verse 1: Prince]
Before I melt the wax to quizzical
Let me just say that you are physically
The most toned one I've ever seen
You're making me proud to be a human be-i-ng (Uh-huh)
And if we're ever naked in the same machine
I'm gonna lick it, baby, joint to joint

[Chorus: Prince]
(Sex me) - Uh, yeah (Safe), joint to joint
(Sex me) - Uh, yeah (Safe), kick it, baby, joint to joint
(Sex me) - Uh, yeah (Safe), joint to joint
(Sex me) - Uh, yeah

[Verse 2: Prince]
So first I need a picture of your mother
To verify the fact that there's not another
One in the universe so supreme
Damn, you got the rock to give a brother cream (Cream)
And if we're ever naked in the same machine
I'm gonna lick it, baby, joint to joint

[Chorus: Prince]
(Sex me) - Uh, yeah (Safe), joint to joint
(Sex, sex, sex me) - If you want to we can kick it, baby, joint to joint
(Sex me) - Oh yeah, I got some hot sauce, joint to joint (Ha ha ha)
(Sex me) - Said kick it baby, joint to joint (Right on, ha ha ha)
(Sex me) - Yeah (Safe)
(Come upstairs to my room)

[Refrain: Prince]
Joint to joint
Joint to joint

[Verse 3: Ninety-9]
I never sucked sour splints from a chew stick
Don't lick bics because fire sticks to flame (Flame)
Get wicks to catch brothers who choose to let burns remain
Now I see all Dicks, Toms ,and Harrys are not the same
Some dipped in my lower lip, sipped a supple poison (Poison, poison, poison)

[Refrain: Prince]
Joint to joint
Joint to joint
Joint to joint
Joint to joint

[Verse 3: Prince]
Joint to joint, nothing comes for free
If you show your love, you can get with me
You can get with me, you can get with me
Joint to joint
Up the stairs to my lovely room
Stroke your face and you're under soon
Sitting in the corner in your underwear
Letting me caress yo' nappy hair
Joint to joint, nothin' comes for free
If you show your love, you can get with me
And if you light my candle, we can share the stone
Flames of desire, sweet gypsy moans
Sweet gypsy moans

[Refrain: Prince]
Joint to joint
Joint to joint
Joint to joint
Joint to joint
Joint to joint
Joint to joint

[Verse 4: Prince]
Joint to joint, nothing comes for free
Oh great, now you think you're my soulmate
You don't even know what kind of cereal I like
Wrong
Captain Crunch with soy milk
Because cows are for calves
You'd probably take me for half
You don't love me, you're a faker
You just want me for my acres
(Na na, na na na na)

[Refrain: Prince]
Joint to joint
Joint to joint
Joint to joint
Joint to joint
Joint to joint
Joint to joint

[Verse 4: Prince]
Joint to joint, nothing comes for free (Sex me)
If you show your love, you can get with me
(Na na, na na na na) (Nothing comes for free)
If we're ever naked in the same machine
Baby, we can kick it joint to joint

[Outro: HM Buff & Prince]
Where to?
I-- I don't know
An..anywhere, just drive
It's me
I'm just driving
Listen, I need to get witchuyou
No, I mean for, I mean for good
I'm serious this time
Nah, that's all over now, you know it
I front sometimes, but you know, this is as quiet as it's kept
Listen, I just gotta get outta here, that's all
Let me call you back, alright?
Yeah, yeah, later

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna give you my love
'Cause I don't wanna lose my mind
I don't wanna give you my love
'Cause if I do it's gonna be the last time
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
'Cause I never want to feel this way again
If I can't be your lover
I don't wanna be your friend, no
I don't wanna be friends, no
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna hold your hand, no
(I don't wanna hold your hand)
'Cause I would just follow you everywhere, oh oh oh
I don't wanna see you dance
(I don't wanna see you, girl)
'Cause I don't even really want to take the chance
Of fallin' in love with you, baby

[Chorus]
If you ever said those beautiful words to me
"If I wanna be your fantasy," yes
I wanna dance, yes

[Interlude]
Let's dance, sugar
Ooh ooh ooh, oh
I don't wanna give you my love
Oh baby, this must be temptation
'Cause I just can't get you off my mind
I try and try
But when I close my eyes
I see you every time

[Verse 3]
I don't wanna go too fast, ooh
'Cause if I do I just might stay
(Stay with me)
I'd stay with you, baby
I guess I better make it last
(Make it last)
The longer that I feel this way
(The longer that you feel this way, girl)
Ooh oh

[Chorus]
'Cause I never want to feel this way again
If I can't be your lover
I don't wanna be your friend, no
I don't wanna be friends, no

[Outro]
I don't wanna give you my love
No
I don't wanna give you my love
Oh-oh honey, baby
(No no no)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, baby
Are you gonna really just stand there
And act like you don't want this, baby?
If you do then you know I just don't care
Oh baby, I could find another
Just like you anywhere
Oh baby, they might not have your hips, girl
And all that pretty hair, oh
At least they won't spend all day in the mirror
Tryin' to find somethin' to wear
At least, they won't wanna make love
Like you do on the stairs, against the pole, on the north corner of the...
Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, it's just not fair
It's just not fair!
Oww!

[Verse 1]
Look outside your window
Tell me now what you see
Coming up the mountain
For a new philosophy

Every single color
Every race and every creed
Looking for the truth, y'all
That's going to set somebody free

[Chorus]
Get on the boat
Get on the boat, people
Get on the boat now
We got room for a hundred more

Get on the boat
Get on the boat, people
Get on the boat now
We got room for a hundred more

[Verse 2]
All across the nation
People doing what they can
To avoid the tribulation
That will be great throughout the land

Everything in darkness
Must come out into the light
When we love each other
That's the only way it's gonna be right

[Chorus]
Get on the boat
Get on the boat, people
Get on the boat now
We got room for a hundred more

Get on the boat (oh yeah)
Get on the boat, people
Get on the boat now
We got room for a hundred more
Good God

[Ad lib]
Say it again
Bridge

[Bridge]
We were meant to live together
Underneath the sun
I can't think of nothing better
Don't you wanna come?
Get on the boat

[Verse 3]
Nevermind what time it is
The party's just begun
No te alejes de este momento de inspiracion
You can let your hair down
Let the music move your feet
Panamama bring the drama
Dancing to the beat
Maceo

[Saxophone Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
What's the harm in listening to the hopeful words we say
If it moves your heart you know you better get in without delay

[Chorus]
Get on the boat
Get on the boat, people
Get on the boat now
We got room for a hundred more

[Ad lib]
Dance to the beat
Ray, Ray, Ray

[Trumpet Solo]

[Ad lib]
Lead line: horns, hit me now

[Chorus]
Get on the boat
Get on the boat, people
Get on the boat now
We got room for a hundred more

Get on the boat
Get on the boat, people
Get on the boat now
We got room for a hundred more

[Bridge]
We were meant to live together
Underneath the sun
I can't think of nothing better
Don't you want to come?
Get on the boat
Oh yeah

[Chorus]
Get on the boat (get on)
Get on the boat, people (c'mon, c'mon)
Get on the boat now
We got room for a hundred more

Get on the boat
Get on the boat, people
Get on the boat now
We got room for a hundred more

[Outro]
Every color, every creed
C'mon c'mon
Come with me
Hallelujah!
Good lord
Lead line, lead line
Can't stand it
Keep it going, keep it going

[Intro]
Let's go down to the holy river
If we drown then we'll be delivered

[Verse 1]
You can still see the picture upon the wall
One eye staring at nothin' at all
The other one trying to focus through all your tears
You can try and try but there's nothin' to hide
You can't run from yourself and what's inside
You got to find the answers to the questions that you most fear

So over and over you ask your soul
Why'd you come down to a world so cold?
And the voice inside says tonight the truth will be told

[Verse 2]
You surrounded yourself with all the wrong faces
Spending your time in all the wrong places
Putting your faith in things that only make you cry
People say they love you when they want to help
But how can they when you can't help yourself?
The more they say they love you, the more you just want to die
So here we go again, the self-analysis
Have another glass of Port and, uh, forget this
The band's playing at the club tonight and they're bound to groove
There you are, you think you're high
You can't ask yourself because you'd only lie
If you had a dollar for every time you tried

[Verse 3]
You can't call nobody 'cause they'll tell you straight up
Come and make love when you really hate 'em
Relationships based on the physical are over and done
They're over and done
Oooh (Over and done)
Oooh
You'd rather have fun
Oooh
With only one, with only one
Only one
One
(One)

[Verse 4]
And then it hit you like a fist on a wall
Who gave you life when there was none at all?
Who gave the sun permission to rise up everyday? (Ooh, oh yes)
Let me tell it (Go on)
If you ask God to love you longer
Every breath you take will make you stronger
Keeping you happy (Happy) and proud to call His name (Go on and say it)
Jesus (Jesus)
So over and over you ask your soul
Why'd you come down to a world so cold?
And the voice inside says tonight the truth will be told
And this time I was listening, hear me

[Chorus]
Let's go down to the holy river
If we drown then we'll be delivered (Yes we will)
If we don't then we'll never see the light (No)
If you die before you try
You'll have to come back and face the light (Oh yes)
When you believe it, you got a good reason to cry (Oh my, my)

[Verse 5]
So I went on down to the holy river
I called my girl and told her I had something to give her
I asked her to marry me and she said yes, I cried
Oh, that night I drowned in her tears and mine
And instead of a glass of sorrow and wine
Looking back you all, I don't miss nothing except the time
And when I see that picture upon the wall
The one eye staring at nothing at all
My eyes trying to focus but these are much different tears
Oh, yes they are

[Chorus]
Let's go down to the holy river
Let's go down to the holy river
Let's go down to the holy river
Let's go down to the holy river

[Outro]
Let's go down to the holy river
Let's go down to the holy river
Let's go down to the holy river

[Chorus]
I can't wait no more, no
Let's have a baby
What are we living for?
Tell me
Let's make love, let's make love

[Verse 1]
So long have I gazed into your eyes
Wondering what they'd look like on a newborn child
I cannot lie when my hand is on your thighs
I'm thinking, isn't it a miracle that life comes from inside?
So long I have listened to your voice
Wondering what it would sound like coming from a girl or a boy
Isn't it funny that when you're truly in love
How just the thought of such things can bring you so much joy?

[Chorus]
And I can't wait no more, oh no
Let's have a baby
Oh girl, come and shut the door, go on, shut it
Let's make love
You want to make love?

[Verse 2]
I'm leaving it up to you
I'll do what you want to do
But you got to understand
You're my woman and I'm your man
I can't even go for a ride
Believe me, honey, I've tried
Without thinking about a little baby
A baby sitting right by my side
And if anybody in the whole wide world
Ever thought that they could do that for me
They are one mistaken girl
Because baby, you got me, you got me open, yes you do
And we're doing just fine
If you really love me, baby
If you can find the time

[Chorus]
I can't wait no more
Let's have a baby
Don't you want to?
What are we living for? Tell me, tell me
Let's have a baby
Come on, come on and shut the door, girl
You know what I want to do
Let's make love

[Verse 1]
How did I ever come this far without you, baby?
What was I thinking, what was I trying to be?
Never did you ever give me reason to doubt you, baby
You are my destiny and this I truly see

[Chorus]
I can see we're like two petals from the same flower, baby
We're like two branches from the same tree
Whenever I look in your eyes, I can see a paradise
You're my saviour, you're all I ever need
Saviour

[Verse 2]
I used to say, no one lover could have me, no one lover
That was before my eyes had seen the light
To make love with another, uh uh, I couldn't do it, no way
(Couldn't do it)
You're my saviour (saviour), you're the only one that does it right

[Chorus]
I can see we're like two petals from the same flower, baby
We're like two branches from the same tree
Whenever I look in your eyes, I can see a paradise
You're my saviour, you're all I ever need
Saviour

[Bridge]
What would I be without your love around me?
(Oh, what would I be, oh, without your love?)
What would I see, you constantly astound me
(Oh baby, you know you constantly astound me)
Saviour
Saviour
Saviour
Saviour
Yeah!
Well, oh!
(Saviour)

[Verse 3]
Oh, how did I (how did I) come this far
Without you, baby? (without you, baby) I don't know
What was I thinking (what was I thinking)
What was I trying to be? (I don't know)
But what I do know is that...

[Chorus]
(Can't you see we're like) We're like two petals from the same flower, baby
We're like two branches from the same tree
(two drops of water from the same sea)
Whenever I look in your eyes, I can see a paradise
You're my saviour, you're all I
You're my saviour, you're all I ever
You're my saviour, you're all I ever need (Saviour)
Saviour, you're all I ever need

[Outro]
Saviour, you (I do)
You are my flower, baby (flower)
Ooh, every, every hour (hour)
Oh, yes you are
Won't you come and just (Won't you come and just)
Rain, I said rain!
(Won't you come and just)
Rain, rain, rain!
(Rain some of your sweet love down on me?)
Down on me!
Down on me!
Saviour! Saviour! Saviour!
Yeah!
Down on me!
Yeah!
Down on me!
Yeah!
Down on me!

[Verse 1]
If I ever held a hand
It was only because I'd never held your hand
That was part of the plan
I had to get it right if I was to be your man
And if I ever kissed your lips
I needed time to cross the others off my list
(Off my list)
A higher high to the trip
(Trip)
I wanted you to go, that was my wish
Yes it was
(Ooh my)

[Chorus]
Friend, lover, sister, mother, wife
Air, food, water, love of my life

[Verse 2]
If I ever shared a bed
It was only because I wanted to live up to what the people said, oh yes
(What they say, what they say?)
Now I'm living instead
Everyday just to say you're the only one who's in my head
(The only one)
Oh yes you are
And if I ever made you cry
All I have to do is think about it and I just want to die
(I just want to die)
(I just want to break down and die, die, die, die)
How I'd ever make it by
(I don't know)
Without you, baby
(Without you, baby)
I don't know (No!)
I hope I never have to try, yeah
(Please don't ever leave me)
Oh, listen to me

[Chorus]
Friend, lover, sister, mother, wife
My sweet, sweet wife
Air, food, water, love of my life

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
The eyes of my child I see every time you look at me
(I see a sweet baby smile)
A sweet baby smile like a light that shines for all to see

[Verse 3]
If I ever held a hand
It was only because I'd never held yours
That was part, part of the plan
I had to get it right if I was to be your man

[Chorus]
Friend, lover, sister, mother, wife
Air, food, water, love of my life
Friend, lover, sister, mother, wife
Air, food, water, love of my life
Teacher (Teacher), healer (Healer), feeler (Feeler), sight for sore eyes
(Let me look at your eyes, you're so pretty)
Oh, yes you are, baby
(Ooh my)
Don't you know you're my friend, my lover, my sister, love of my life?
(Mother, wife)
Yeah, baby, yes you are
(I'll stay with you forever)
(I'll stay with you forever)
'Til death do us part, baby
(Yes sir!)
Air (Te amo), food (Te amo), water (Te amo), love (Love of my life)
You are the only, only love of my life
My friend, lover, sister, mother, wife

[Chorus]
Everybody keeps trying to break my heart
Everybody except for me
I just want a chance to play the part
The part of someone truly free

[Verse 1]
Like candle slowly burning, I can feel my world unravel
Hemisphere upon hemisphere lie beneath my soul, soul
My enemies kept it turning, but now they pound the gavel
And judging me accordingly, I know, I know

[Chorus]
Everybody keeps trying to break my heart
Everybody except for me
I just want a chance to play the part
The part of someone truly free

[Verse 2]
Burning slowly candle, handle careless they did
Merrily down three heartbreak boulevards
Like fashion statements, they lie "you be looking so good tonight, kid"
I do my best to party, it's just that everybody keeps trying to break my heart

[Chorus]
Everybody keeps trying to break my heart
Everybody except for me
I just want a chance to play the part
The part of someone truly free

[Bridge]
Except for me (Except for me)
I just want a chance to play
(Just want to be free)

[Verse 3]
Slowly candle burns, where'd they learn hypnosis?
How'd they keep me under for so long?
Break the bread I earn, just keep me far from closest
I need their kind to illustrate what's wrong - what's wrong?
Well, I'll tell you they just keep trying to break my heart
They just keep trying to break my heart, ow!
(Everybody)
(Everybody)

[Chorus]
Everybody keeps trying to break my heart
Everybody except for me
I just want a chance to play the part
The part of someone truly free

[Outro]
But I can't let you break my heart
(Everybody keeps trying to break my heart)
Slave! (Everybody keeps trying to break my heart)
Slave! Slave! (Everybody keeps trying to break my heart)
Slave!

New world
New world
New world
New world

[Verse 1]
When the sharpest vibration
Saves you from obliteration
The intelligence of your bed reacts
Covering you head to toe with an air-filled sack

[Chorus]
When the lines blur every boy and girl
How we gonna make it in this brave new world?
Love for one another
New world
Love for one another
New world

[Verse 2]
When you wanna find some isolation
But the tracker you got from vaccination (Keeps playing)
Keeps playing "You'll Never Walk Alone" (Over and over)
They're always listening, especially on the phone

[Chorus]
When the lines blur every boy and girl
How we gonna make it in this brave new world?
Love for one another
New world
Love for one another
New world

[Interlude]
Wait a minute
New world

[Verse 3]
Did you hear about the new pill? It feels like sex
Guaranteed to thrill with no ill side-effects
A pill that will stop the wrinkles, a pill that will stop the pain
A pill that will make a baby never seek political gain
What's it all for when you can alter biology?
Who or what, then my friend, will you and I be?
Who or what, then my friend, will you and I be?

[Verse 4]
When the sharpest vibration
Saves you from obliteration
When the melting pot stirs, how you going to take it?
When you can't tell him from her, how you going to fake it?

[Chorus]
Ooh, when the lines blur every boy and girl
How we gonna make it in this brave new world?
Love for one another
New world, ooh
Love for one another
(Take it, fake it)
Love for one another
New world
New world

[Verse 1]
Skylark
Have you anything to say to me?
Won't you tell me where my love can be?
Is there a meadow in the mist
Where someone's waiting to be kissed?

[Verse 2]
Skylark
Have you seen a valley green with spring?
Where my heart can go a journeying
Over the shadows and the rain
To a blossom covered lane

[Bridge]
And in your lonely flight
Haven't you heard the music in the night?
Wonderful music, faint as a will o' the wisp
Crazy as a loon, sad as a gypsy serenading the moon

[Verse 3]
Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

[Verse 4]
Oh skylark
I don't know if you can find these things
But my heart is riding on your wings
So if you see them anywhere
Won't you lead me there?

[Chorus]
I need someone, hey baby, let me love you
Please don’t push me away
Let me in your life
I wasn’t there when she hurt you
So why should i have to pay?
Baby, let me in your life

[Verse 1]
I want to share your tomorrow
So I must beg, beg you for today
And if she’s the cause of your sorrow
Be glad that she’s gone away

[Chorus]
I need someone, hey baby, let me love you
Please don’t push me away
Let me in your life
I wasn’t there when she hurt you
So why should I have to pay?
Baby, let me in your life

'Cause I, I want to share your tomorrow
And so, and so i must beg, beg you for today
And if she’s the cause of your sorrow
Be glad that she’s gone away, yeah

[Outro]
Let me in your life, come on baby
Let me in your life, na na na, baby
Let me in your life, ah ah ah, baby
Let me in your life, yeah, baby
Let me in your life, ah ah, baby
Let me in your life, yeah, baby

[Chorus]
There ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
There ain't nothing like the real thing
There ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
There ain't nothing like the real thing

[Verse 1]
I see your picture hangin' on the wall
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name
I realize it's just a picture in a frame
And I read your letters, you're not here
They don't move me, they don't groove me like when I hear
Your sweet voice whispering in my ear

[Chorus]
There ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
There ain't nothing like the real thing

[Bridge]
No other sound is quite the same as your name
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better
Let's stay together
Together, baby
Together, yeah
Together, oh, together

[Verse 2]
I've got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone
I'm well aware nothing takes the place of your being there

[Outro]
There ain't nothing, there ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
There ain't nothing like the real thing
(Not like the real thing)
There ain't nothing like the real thing
(Not like the real thing)
Oh, oh oh, there ain't nothing like the real thing
(Not like the real thing)
There ain't nothing like the real thing
(Not like the real thing)
The real, the real, there ain't nothing like the real thing
(Not like the real thing)
The real, the real, the real, the real thing
Oh, the real thing
(Not like the real thing)
(Not like the real thing)

[Chorus]
I’m in love, yes I am
I’m in love, yes I am, uh
I’m in love, hey baby, hey, you know I am
I’m in love, uh, huh, you know I am

[Verse 1]
Friends all wonder what’s come over me
I’m as happy as any girl could be

[Chorus]
(Love, love, love) I’m in love
(Love, love, love) believe me I am

(Love, love, love) hoo, whoa, whoa, whoa

[Verse 2]
And i’m so glad that it’s me who had to change
I’m sprouting and blooming like the last summer rose

[Chorus]
(Love, love, love) I’m in love

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Can you take me home
Where we can be alone?
Can you make me happy
'Til my pain is gone?
Can you get me excited?
Excited enough to thank the God above...

[Chorus]
For the human body
Yeah, yeah, yeah
For the human body
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Can you get me excited
'Til my love is long?
Can you let me ride it (Oh yeah)
'Til the early morning?

[Verse 1]
Though you don’t call anymore
I sit and wait in vain
I guess I'll rap on your door (your door)
Tap on your window pane (tap on your window pane)
I want to tell you, baby
Changes I’ve been going through
Missing you, listen you

[Chorus]
'Til you come back to me that’s what I’m gonna do

[Verse 2]
Why did you have to decide
You had to set me free?
I’m going to swallow my pride (my pride)
I’m going to beg you to please, baby please see me (baby won't you see me?)
I’m going to walk by myself
Just to prove that my love is true
All for you baby

[Chorus]
'Til you come back to me that’s what I’m gonna do

[Bridge]
Living for you, my dear
Is like living in a world of constant fear
Hear my plea (hear my plea)
I’ve got to make you see (make you see)
That our love is dying (our love is dying)

[Verse 3]
Although your phone you ignore
Somehow I must, somehow I must, how I must explain
I’m going to rap on your door (your door)
Tap on your window pane (tap on your window pane)
I’m going to camp by your steps
Until I get through to you (uuuh)
I’ve got to change your view, baby

[Chorus]
'Til you come back to me that’s what I’m gonna do
'Til you come back to me that’s what I’m gonna do
'Til you come back to me that’s what I’m gonna do

Tap on your window pane (tap on)
Open out baby, I’m gonna rap on your door (tap on)
Tap on your, tap on your (tap on)
Tap on your , tap on your window pane (tap on your window pane)
I’m going to rap on your door (tap on)

[Intro]
Nigga like me smoke weed everyday
Nigga like me high all the time
Shut the fuck up man
It's Taylor's! Ugh

[Verse 1]
One shot, one kill, what the deal?
Learned this from my OG, shit is real
Made niggas, paid niggas, all around
One phone call, brr, it's going down
Clique full of psychos, goon in some tight clothes
Need my paper straight, no typos
Right flows, but really I don't write
I'm in the studio all night
Make sure the shit you call a dream is what I really call my life
From my city, Harlem Nights, you niggas silly - this the 'burg
Not Philly, shout them niggas though that wheelie on them bikes
These niggas fans, they just sittin'
Talk about plans they ain't been in
Even rock brands they don't fit in
Ain't got to go to France, spend 100 bands
Gotta understand, damn!

[Hook]
I can't stand fake niggas
I can't stand fake niggas
I can't stand fake niggas

[Verse 2]
Walk it how I talk it, if I roll it, I'mma spark it
If she bad, I tell her park it, I'mma hit it like a target
Oh shit! He blowing up your phone again
Must ain't let him know, you ain't coming home again
Leave that man alone, could be doing better
Do it on your own, could be on a jet, flying 'round the globe
Baby we gonna smoke a whole zone
Burning kush till her eyes gone
Cellphone by the remote control
When your girlfriends call, they just get the dial tone
Paper wild long
Try to draw the line between personal and business
But these niggas in their feelings like bitches
Mobbing through these trenches, always on a mission
Rules to the game, starve the competition
Khalifa Kush keep me high, to where I don’t wanna speak
Broke and jail - two things I don't wanna be
You talk tough, but your clique is nervous
Wash 'em up, get that quick detergent
Then we done with 'em
There's gotta be somebody to blame
It's a shame, shame, shame

[Outro]
I can't stand fake niggas
I can't stand fake niggas
I can't stand fake niggas
What? What?
I can't stand fake niggas
I can't stand fake niggas
Fake ass, niggas, shit
Dawg, damn, woah
28 Grams, 28, and a bag in my hand
God, Damn!
Ho
Hahahahaha
Hol up, hol up, hol up
Man when my hair get long you niggas in trouble
Just warning you now

[Intro]
(Dead like Elvis)
Check, check, one-two, check
You know what he's saying?

[Refrain]
Face down!
Face down!

[Verse 1]
Somebody once told him that he wouldn't take Prince through the ringer
Let him go down as a washed up singer
Ain't that a bitch?
Thinkin' all along that he wanted to be rich
Never respected the root of all evil and he still don't to this day, huh
Bury him face down, let the motherfuckers kiss a ass, OK?

[Refrain]
Face down!
Face down!

[Verse 2]
Told them he wanted to sing a song about a black child going buck wild
And they just laughed in his face
Talk to your lawyer but you got no case
What you need to do is keep your place
Next time you pull a card, it better be an ace motherfucker
Or you can lay face down (Face down!)

[Refrain]
Face down!
Face down!

[Verse 3]
Him and her meaning who I'm singing about
And his psychoanalyst kinda saw the catalyst
As the devil with the blue jeans on, huh
Ain't it kinda funny when you see the dawn?
Sign the name they gave you
But when them motherfuckers turn around ass up, you're what?

[Refrain]
Face down! One-two
Face down! New Power Generation in the house, bury them all
Face down! Yes, oh Lord
Face down!

[Outro]

[Intro]
Baby you're so special
And I'm a man's woman, always, yes I am
I feel so special to have a man like you
Oh

[Verse 1]
You're more than just a joy, baby
Oh, you're more than just a joy, baby
Loving you tenderly is what I need for me
Oh, the way you warm my buns
Honey begins to run

[Verse 2]
You're more than just a joy, baby
Takes my kind of woman to understand you, baby
I'm sweet-willing proof
Your one woman stock, best of breed
You know when I show I'll be just what my baby needs, oh

[Verse 3]
You make it so easy
So easy to please me
I've had so many to find out
I really haven't had any
Your sincerity, baby, makes me true
I'm gonna stretch on out right here
And just go ahead and do what i've got to do

[Non-lyrical Vocalizing]

[Verse 4]
Give me good feelings beyond my mind's belief
But when it's finally over
I must confess that I'm relieved
You're more than just a joy, baby
You're more than just a joy, baby

[Intro]
Hey girl, I bet you didn't know I had both eyes on you
It's true
And you know what? I seen all those other guys too
Baby, frankly, I don't give a damn

[Verse 1]
Many guys have come to you
With a line that wasn't true
And you'd pass them by (Pass them by)
Though you're in the center ring
And their lines don't mean a thing
Why don't you let me try? (Let me try)
Now I don't wear a diamond ring
I don't even know a song to sing
All I know is

[Chorus]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la means I love you
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la means I love you

[Verse 2]
If I ever saw a girl
That I needed in this world
You are the one for me
Let me hold you in my arms
Going to fill you with my charms
I'm sure that you will see (You will see)
The things I am saying are true
And the way I want to explain them to you
Baby, can you listen to me?

[Chorus]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la means I love you
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la means I love you

[Bridge]
So there, the book is open
What you want to do?
Can you do-o-o me, baby, like I want to do you?
Come here, let me hold you in my arms
Let me fill you with my charms
The things I am saying are true
And the way I explain them to you
Yes, to you!

[Chorus]
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la means I love you
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la means I love you
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la means I love you
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la means I love you

[Outro]
I love you, I really, really love you
Ooh listen to me, baby
Ooh, I love you, I love you, love you
Ooh, take my hand, girl
You got to understand
I want to be, I want to be, I want to be your man
You know where to find me when you make up that mind

[Verse 1]
Your eyes don’t shine like they used to shine
And the thrill is gone when your lips meet mine

[Refrain]
I’m afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love

[Verse 2]
Your kiss don’t mean what it used, what it used to mean
It once was inspired, now it’s just another routine

[Refrain]
I’m afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love, and so is love

[Bridge]
I guess I’ll have to play Pagliacci
And get myself a clown’s disguise
And then I’ll learn to laugh, laugh like Pagliacci
Oh, with tears all in my eyes

[Verse 3]
Hey baby, your kiss don’t mean
What it used, what it used to mean
It once was inspired, now it’s just an everytime routine

[Refrain]
I’m so afraid the masquerade is over
And so is love
And so is love
With pen in hand
You sign your name
Today at five
I might be on that train
(Hou hou-hou hou-hou)
And you'll be free
And I will be alone
(Alone)
Oh-oh alone
(Alone)

If you think we can't find
That a love we once knew
If you think that I can't make
It all up to you
Then I'll be gone
You'll be on your own
(Your own)
All on your own
(Your own)
And this is what I wanna know
Can you take good care of the children
Can you take them to school every day
(Every every every)
Can you teach them how
To catch the fish and keep all of the bullies away
(Take the bullies all in away)
Can you keep them away
(Take the bullies all in away)

And tonight as you laid
In your lonely lonely bed
And you try to tell me that when you look at that pillow
Where I laid my head
With your heart on fire
(Fire)
Would you have no desire
(Have no desire)
To kiss me
(Kiss me)
To kiss and kiss and kiss and kiss and kiss me
(Honey, honey, honey, woooh)

And if you can forget
The good times we had (But just let me to feel you)
If you think that not do

[Verse 1]
Style is not something that comes in a bottle
Style is more like Jackie O. when she was doing Aristotle

Style is like a second cousin to class

Style is loving yourself until everyone else does too

You got it! - Style (say what?)
You got it! - Style (Come on)

Try to dress up every Sunday morning bright
Style don't get married then break the vow in a year
Style is keeping a promise
Raise your hand you all if you hear me
(Style)
(Style)
Style is not biting style when You can't find the funk
Style is the face you make on a Michael Jordan dunk
Style ain't the jeep you bought when you know your broke ass got bills
Style is letting your lover drive while you talk on the phone and chill

[Chorus]
You got it! - Style (Come on)
You got it! - Style (say what?)
You got it! - Style (Come on)
You got it! - Style (Check it)

[Verse 4]
Bridge
Style is a gold-tooth smile with an attitude
Style is a peaceful wild posting the rude
Style is growing your own food
Style is a non-violent march
Style is an accurate account of what's inside every heart (Style)

Style is a man that cries
Style is the glow in a pregnant woman's eyes

Style is when all black men are free
Style is you and me

[Intro]
Do it like she like
Do it like she like it
Do it like she like
Do it like she like it
Do it like she like
Do it like she like it
Do it like she like
Do it like she like it

[Chorus]
Do it like she like it
So your baby don't want to sleep around
Give her what she want when she want
When it come to you, she down

[Verse 1]
Baby let me read her journal
Or should I say: she turned around and it was gone
The innuendo reads eternal
Or should I say: every other page I'm on

[Verse 2]
When she come to cook your dinner
You can ask her if what I say is true
The secret will remain within her
But her shade of red will turn yours blue

[Chorus]
Do it like she like it
So your baby don't want to sleep around
Give her what she want when she want
When it come to you, she down

[Verse 3]
Maybe you recall last summer
When you saw her riding in my car
A kiss or two later she was back in your bed
Smelling like a fallen star
Just because she's fine
You think she don't wine and dine with everyone you know
Oh, long as you're fooled, I'm cool
She says she going to put me in a video
You need to

[Chorus]
Do it like she like it
So your baby don't wanna sleep around
(I'm watching you, baby) (Do it like she like it, do it)
Give her what she want when she want it
When it come to you, she down
(Do it like she like)

[Post-Chorus]
Sleep around, sleep around
Sleep around, sleep around

[Bridge]
I'm the one who sent the herbs and a book on how to use them
I'm the one who pointed out her fears and how to lose them
And if a difference love will make
This advice you ought to take

[Verse 1]
Baby let me read her journal
Or should I say: she turned around and it was gone
The innuendo reads eternal
Or should I say: every other page I'm on

[Hook]
You need to
Do it like she like, do it like she like it (Sleep around)
Do it like she like, do it like she like it (Sleep around)
Do it like she like, do it like she like it (Sleep around)
Do it like she like it, like it, like it

[Chorus]
Do it like she like it
So your baby don't want to sleep around
Give her what she want when she want
When it come to you, she down

[Post-Chorus]
Sleep around, sleep around
Sleep around, sleep around

[Chorus]
Do it like she like it
So your baby don't want to sleep around
Give her what she want when she want
When it come to you, she down

[Post-Chorus]
Sleep around, sleep around
Sleep around, sleep around

[Hook]
Do it like she like
Do it like she like it
Do it like she like
Do it like she like it
Do it like she like
Do it like she like it
Do it like she like
Do it like she like it

[Outro]
(Sleep around)
(Sleep around)
(Sleep around)
(Sleep around)
(Sleep around)
Do it like she like
Do it like she like
Do it like she like
Do it like she like
Do it like she like
Do it like she like it
Do it like she like
Do it
Do it
Do it
Do it
Do it
Do it
Do it
Do it
Do it
Do it
Do it like she like it (Sleep around)

Sound of silver, talk to me
Makes you want to feel like a teenager
Until you remember the feelings of
A real-life emotional teenager
Then you think again

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
The crowd sees me out dancing
Carefree and romancing
Oh, I'm happy with my someone new

[Chorus]
I'm laughing on the outside
Crying on the inside
'Cause I'm still in love with you

[Verse 2]
They see me night and daytime
Oh, I'm having such a gay time
But they don't know what I go through

[Chorus]
I'm laughing on the outside
Crying on the inside
'Cause I'm still in love with you

[Bridge]
No one knows it's just a pose
Pretending I'm glad we're apart
And when I cry, my eyes are dry
All of the tears are in my heart

[Verse 3]
So, darling, can't we make up?
Ever, ever since our breakup
Make believe is all I do

[Chorus]
I'm laughing on the outside
Crying on the inside
'Cause I'm still in love with you

[Outro]
Mhm, I'm still laughing on the outside
But every day I'm crying on the inside
Because I'm still, still in love with you

[Intro: Scrap D.]
Da, da, da, da
Da, da, da, da, da
(Yeah y'all, it's like that y'all, it's like "Bet Your Life")
Yeah
It's like rolling in a Bronco pumping them pumps
You know what I'm saying?
On Broadway or something, you know what I'm saying?
Yo yo, straight up
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Scrap D.]
Hey yo, call the paddywagon, I've seen a black boy cash stacking
Smirk on my face screaming, "Fuck the Grand Dragon"
For the fast cash, we be thinking to slow
Clowning each others on the damn talk shows
I don't wanna house but I gotta stick and rob
I got a disease, it's called "Can't find a job"
Smoking on the herbs help me see a little better
Looking for a job in this cold ass weather

[Chorus: Prince]
Watch out, I'm trying to get my shit together (Da, da, da, da, da, da, da)
Yeah - da, da, da, da (Da, da, da, da, da, da, da)
(Got to keep it going, gotta keep it going)
It's been kind of lonely (Da, da, da, da, da, da, da)
Da, da, da, da (Da, da, da, da, da, da)
(Got to keep it going, got to keep it going)

[Verse 2: Scrap D.]
Hey yo, as soon as I come home, I'm stressed by my mama
Questioning my whereabouts like I'm the Unabomber
Question mark, comma, freeze all the drama
Intensive care flows for all you hoes smacked with trauma
As I sit back with my blunt and gin
Grab a pen, write a song about a million black men
Trying to blame all this violence on gangs
What about those fools who kill for nothing and hijack planes?
(Let me hear you...)

[Chorus: Prince]
Get your shit together (Da, da, da, da, da, da, da)
Da, da, da, da (Da, da, da, da, da, da, da)
(Got to keep it going, got to keep it going)
Da, da, da, da (Da, da, da, da, da, da, da)
Da, da, da, da (Da, da, da, da, da, da)
(Got to keep it going, got to keep it going)

[Verse 3: Scrap D.]
Yo, I'm going for the gold like an Olympic sprinter
Fuck the bullshit, steaks for dinner this winter
Yo, I've seen a murder scene that left a fool scarred
Plus I saw a prisonyard way before a schoolyard
Time's rough plus time's running out
My mom said if I trip one more time, I'm getting kicked out
And I ain't trying to make excuses
But looking for a job in the ghetto is fucking useless (Let me hear you sing)

[Chorus: Prince]
Get your shit together, straight up (Da, da, da, da, da, da, da)
Yeah, uh - da, da, da, da (Da, da, da, da, da, da, da)
(Let me hear you sing)
Da, da, da, da (Da, da, da, da, da, da, da)
Da, da, da, da (Da, da, da, da, da, da)

[Bridge: Prince]
Ask yourself your destination
What the source of your inspiration be
And you will find a spirit trying to get back to the mind
How you was in your mama's belly
Live and let live was the order of the day
What you say?
Loving one another is the only way!

[Chorus: Prince]
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da
If you believe in one thing, if you believe in to things
(Da, da, da, da, da, da, da)
If you believe in anything then let me hear you sing
"Da, da, da, da, da, da, da"
Keep on believing (Da, da, da, da, da, da)

[Outro: Prince & Scrap D.]
Lord
(Yeah you all, it's like that y'all, it's like "Bet Your Life")
(Yeah you all)
(Come on)
(Yeah you all)
(Yeah you all)
(It's like "Bet Your Life")
(Yeah you all, it's like "Bet Your Life")
(Yeah you all, it's like "Bet Your Life")
(Yeah you all, it's like "Bet Your Life")
(Yeah)

[Sampled AOL Greeting]
Welcome, you've got mail

[Pre-Chorus]
It was Sunday night
Instead of doing what I usually do...

[Chorus]
I scan my computer looking for a site
Somebody to talk to, funny and bright
I scan my computer looking for a site
Make believe it's a better world, a better life

[Verse 1]
Nothing on TV I ain't seen before
Another murder on the news, I can't take no more
Evil Incorporated, blowing up bombs and things
I have a child, huh, I have a lot to explain
I could write a letter but who would I send it to?

[Pre-Chorus]
It was Sunday night
Instead of doing what I usually do...

[Chorus]
I scan my computer looking for a site
Somebody to talk to, funny and bright
I scan my computer looking for a site
Make believe it's a better world, a better life

[Verse 2]
I called an old friend of mine just the other day
No congratulations, no respect paid
All she did was wonder if the rumors were true
I said - "No, I ain't dead yet, but uh.. what about you?"
I can count my friends with a peace sign: one, two

[Pre-Chorus]
It was Sunday night
Instead of doing what I usually do...

[Chorus]
I scan my computer looking for a site
Somebody to talk to, funny and bright
I scan my computer looking for a site
Make believe it's a better world, a better life

[Bridge]
I got no mail, my computer
I told them I don't want to see a doctor unless he's lonely too

[Pre-Chorus]
It was Sunday night
Instead of doing what I usually do...

[Chorus]
I scan my computer looking for a site
Somebody to talk to, funny and bright
I scan my computer looking for a site
Make believe it's a better world, a better life

[Outro]
A better life
A better life
A better life
A better life
A better life

[Sampled AOL Farewell]
Goodbye

[Verse 1]
If God had a name, what would it be
And would we call it to His face
If we were faced with Him and all His glory?
What would you ask if you had just one question?

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, God is great
Yeah, yeah, God is good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

[Chorus]
What if God was one of us?
Just a slave like one of us?
Just a stranger on the bus
Trying to make His way home

[Verse 2]
If God had a face, what would it look like
And would you want to see it
If seeing meant that you would have to believe in things like heaven
And Jesus and the saints and all the prophets?

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, God is great
Yeah, yeah, God is good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

[Chorus]
What if God was one of us?
Just a slave like one of us?
Just a stranger on the bus
Trying to make His way home

[Pre-Chorus]
And yeah, yeah, God is great
Yeah, yeah, God is good
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

[Chorus]
What if God was one of us?
Just a slave like one of us?
Just a stranger on the bus
Trying to make His way home
Like a holy rolling stone
Back up to heaven all alone
Nobody calling on the phone
Except for the Pope maybe in Rome

[Outro]
But He ain't home, He ain't home, He ain't home!
No, no, no
He ain't home!
No, no, no
He ain't home!
Oh yeah, oh!
(What if God was one us?)
(What if God was one us?)
(What if God was one us?)
(What if God was one us?)

[Verse 1]
Desperate is the day that is tomorrow
For those who do not know the time has come
To whip the dogs that beg, steal or borrow
From the table God set for His Son

[Verse 2]
Wicked is the witch that stands for nothing
All the while watching to see you fall
Deeper than the ditch that bred your suffering
The one being dug right now by them all

[Verse 3]
Happy is the way to meet your burdens
No matter how heavy or dark the day
Pity on those with no hope for tomorrow
It's never as bad as it seems until we say

[Verse 4]
Precious is the baby with a mother
That tells him that his Savior is coming soon
All that believe will cleanse and purify themselves
Put down the needle, put down the spoon
Put down the needle, put down the spoon

[Verse 5]
Sacred is the prayer that asks for nothing, oh
While seeking to give thanks for every breath we take, oh
Blessed are we inside this prayer
For in the new world, we will be there

[Refrain]
The only love there is, is the love we make
The only love there is, is the love we make
(The only love there is, is the love we make)
Only love there is, only love there is
The only love there is, is the love we make (Yeah)
The only love there is, is the love we make

[Verse 1]
Ever since I was a little baby
I had to have double everything
When they tell me that's enough
That's when I want to fill my cup
To the top, Johnny, hear me sing

[Chorus]
Emancipation: free to do what I want to
Emancipation: see you in the purple rain
Emancipation: free to do what I want to
Emancipation: break the chain, break the chain

[Verse 2]
Ever since that Eve did unto Adam, alright
What somebody been sure enough doing to me
(Watch it!)
I've been trying to break the chain
Get my little ass out the game
I'd rather sing with a bit more harmony, oh

[Chorus]
Emancipation: free to do what I want to
Emancipation: see you in the purple rain
Emancipation: free to do what I want to
Emancipation: break the chain, break the chain

[Bridge]
Johnny please, huh, when I was on my knees
My back was broken and my spirit ill at ease
And now it seems just like the autumn leaves
Your money's turned from green to brown and now you best believe

[Chorus]
Emancipation: free to do what I want to
Emancipation: see you in the purple rain
Emancipation: free to do what I want to
Emancipation: break the chain, break the chain, break the chain
Break the chain, oh yeah
Well, sure enough
See you in the purple rain
Emancipation: free to do what I want to
Break the, break the, break the chain!

[Outro]
Hey!
Alright!
Hey!
(Emancipation)
Hey!
(Emancipation)
Hey!
(Emancipation)
Hey!
(Emancipation)
Hey!
(Emancipation)
(Emancipation)
Free, don't think I ain't
(Emancipation)

[Verse 1: Aretha Franklin]
I see myself in your face
A reflection of pain
Somebody made you
Cry over and over again

[Verse 2: George Benson]
Still you and I made it
Through all of this for a reason
Yes, we did
Could it be that we created
Affair for all seasons

[Chorus: Aretha Franklin & George Benson]
Because you and I
Were meant to be lovers
The search is over for us
There's no other, we're
Finally at the rainbow's end
Baby, together, we'll mend
All the cracks in our heart
And love all the hurt away

[Verse 3: George Benson]
Woman, you are the thing that I
Hoped and I prayed for
You give you love and I'm
Happy like never before

[Verse 4: Aretha Franklin]
You be the strength and I'll
Be your shoulder to lean on
(You can lean on my shoulder)
We'll build a world and fill our
Whole place with love songs

[Chorus: Aretha Franklin & George Benson]
Because you and I
Were meant to be lovers
The search is over for us
There's no other, we're
Finally at the rainbow's end
Baby, together, we'll mend
All the cracks in our heart
And love all the hurt away

Because you and I
Were meant to be lovers
The search is over for us
There's no other, we're
Finally at the rainbow's end
Baby, together, we'll mend
All the cracks in our heart
And love all the hurt away

[Outro: Aretha Franklin & George Benson]
Love all the hurt away
And love all the hurt away
Yes, we're gonna love
We're going to love, baby
We're going to love, love, ohhh
Love all the hurt away
Yeah, yeah

[Verse]
Take a look in the mirror, look at yourself
But don’t you look too close
‘Cause you just might see
The person that you hate the most
Lord, what’s happening to this human race?
I can’t even see one friendly face
Brothers fight brothers and sisters wink their eyes
While silver tongues bear fruits of poison lies
Just take a look at your children born innocent
Every boy and every girl
Denying themselves a real chance
To build a better world
Dear Lord, dear Lord
What’s happening to your precious dream?
It’s washing away on a bloody bloody stream
Take a look at your children before it’s too late
And tell them nobody wins when the prize is hate

[Intro]
Hold on
Hold on
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hold on

[Verse 1]
Don't you ever feel sad
Lean on me when times are bad
When the day comes and you're down
In a river of trouble and about to drown

[Chorus]
Just hold on, I'm coming
Hold on, I'm coming
Hey, hey hold on

[Verse 2]
I'll stick closer than any brother
If you let me, I'll be closer than any other
And when the day comes
And you're down
On a river of trouble
And about to drown

[Chorus]
Hold on
Said I'm coming (Yeah, yeah)
Hold on, You know I'm coming (You, you)
Hold on

[Break]
I'm your woman, I'm coming
You hold on
Beep, Beep
Yeah reach out to me for satisfaction
Call my name for quick reaction
Woah, woah, yeah

[Chorus]
Hold on
Hold on
I'm there
Hold on
Hold on I'm coming
I'm there
Yes I am
Don't you ever feel sad

[Verse 3]
Lean on me when times get bad
When the day comes and you're down
In a river of trouble and about to drown

[Chorus]
Hold on

[Verse 4]
Little Jack Horner was
Sitting in a corner, you know
Eating his Christmas pie
The dude stuck in a thumb
And pulled out a plum
And said what a funky boy am I
The queen of hearts
She made some tarts
All on a summer's day
The king of hearts
My man called for the tarts
And they just greased and funked away
Yes they did
Vrooom
I'm your woman, I'm coming
Beep, Beep
I'm coming
Vrooom

[Chorus]
I'm your woman, I'm coming
Just hold on, 'cause I'm coming
Hold on, I'm coming
Just hold on, I'm coming
Hold on, I'm coming (Ms. Funkdafied)
I'm your woman
Just hold on, I'm coming
Just hold on
Hold on

[Verse 1]
People working night and day
You need to take some time out to get away
Life is just a one way ride
There ain't no second chance that you can try

[Chorus]
Can't you see all the fun is free?
So, come on out we're livin' in the streets tonight

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I know you sure feeling low
It's time to get on up and steal the show
Leave your worries all behind
You've got to make your smile the bottom line

[Chorus]
Can't you see all the fun is free?
So, come on out we're livin' in the streets tonight

[Bridge]
Do just what you want to do, you know that you can try
Get the groove and take it to the sky, here on dancin' night

[Chorus]
Can't you see all the fun is free?
So, come on out we're livin' in the streets tonight

[Verse 3]
Do just what you want to do, let no one pull you down
Join the party, people let it last, all night to party
Spread the feeling through the land
We've got to share this action while we can
No more talking, no more chat
We're going to make this evening come alive

[Chorus]
Can't you see all the fun is free?
So, come on out we're livin' in the streets tonight

[Outro]
Living in the streets tonight
Living in the streets tonight
Come on out, we'll smoke this town together
Living in the streets tonight
Come on out, we'll smoke this town together
Living in the streets tonight
Come on out, we'll smoke this town together
Living in the streets tonight
Come on out, we'll smoke this town together

[Intro]
Starlight, star bright, falling star that I'm seeing tonight

[Verse 1]
Time is rolling on and I, I'm the one who's wrong
I'm the one should be moving on, oh babe
A heart can only stand so much
It needs to touch someone, someone
So, it's up to you, do you love me too?
I get so confused when you throw excuses my way, oh baby
I need your love to hang on, please tell me that love ain't gone forever

[Chorus]
(There's a star for everyone who's lost)
Where is my rainbow, where is my sunny day?
(There's a star for everyone who's lost)
Where is the fantasy, who took the dream away?
(There's a star for everyone)
Where is my star, who took the dream away?

[Verse 2]
Baby, every word you say always seems touch
So that I'll be making my way back to you
Please tell me this love for you is really shared by two

[Chorus]
(There's a star for everyone who's lost)
Where is my rainbow, where is my sunny day?
(There's a star for everyone who's lost)
Where is the fantasy, who took the dream away?
(There's a star for everyone)
Where is my star, who took the dream away?

[Bridge]
Tried to find the reasons, patience wears thin
I tried to slow the seasons
But I know some day I will win, I will win
There's a star for everyone who's lost
There's a star for everyone who's lost
There's a star for everyone

[Outro]
Where is my rainbow, where is my sunny day?
Who took my star away, who took the dream?
Where is my rainbow, where is my sunny day?
Who took my star away, who took the dream?
Who took my star away, who took the dream?
Where is my rainbow?

[Intro]
I can't cover up my feelings
In the name of love
Or play it safe
For a while that was easy
And if living for myself
Is what I'm guilty of
Go on and sentence me
I'll still be free

[Verse 1]
It's my turn
To see what I can see
I hope you'll understand
That this time's just for me
Because it's my turn
With no apologies
I've given up the truth
For those I've tried to please
But now it's my turn
Even though I don't have all the answers
At least I know that I'll take my share of chances

[Chorus]
And there ain't no use in holding on
Because nothing stays the same
So I'll let it rain
Because the rain ain't going to hurt me
And I'll let you go
Although I know it won't be easy

[Verse 2]
It's my turn
With no more room for lies
For years I've seen my life
Through someone else's eyes
But now it's my turn
To try and find my way
And if I should get lost
At least I'll own today
Because it's my turn
Oh, it's my turn
Yeah

[Chorus]
And there ain't no use in holding on
Because nothing stays the same
So I'll let it rain
Because the rain ain't going to hurt me
And I'll let you go
Although I know it won't be easy

[Verse 3]
It's my turn
To see what I can see
I hope you'll understand
That this time's just for me
Because it's my turn
To turn and say goodbye
I sure would like to know
That you're still on my side
Because it's my turn
It's my turn
It's my turn

[Outro]
To start from number one
Trying to undo
Some damage that's been done
But now it's my turn
To reach and touch the sky
No one's going to say
At least I didn't try
It's my turn
Yes, it's my turn
It's my turn
It's my turn

[Verse 1]
I would like to see a show of hands
Nothing concealed, roll up your sleeve
Nothing up my sleeve except my heart
And I believe we've come apart
I would like to see you play your cards
Reveal your hands and show your heart
Maybe we could get it back

[Chorus]
With truth and honesty that's what we need to hold on
To the good stuff we believe in
Before we land up loose and sad and free
Before we find that it's gone
We could pull it back together, truth and honesty
Open up your hands, show me your heart

[Verse 2]
Let's stay up till dawn and talk it out
Nothing concealed, no alibi, returning to light
Before we start, then all we do is fall apart
If I can see the sunlight in your eyes
Then maybe we all could shine, yeah
Maybe we could get it back, oh baby, yeah baby

[Chorus]
With truth and honesty that's what we need to hold on
To the good stuff we believe in
Before we land up loose and sad and free
Before we find that it's gone
We could pull it back together, truth and honesty
Open up your hands, show me your heart
With truth and honesty that's what we need to hold on
To the good stuff we believe in
Before we land up loose and sad and free
Before we find that it's gone
We could pull it back together, truth and honesty
Open up your hands, show me your heart

[Outro]
Truth and honesty, you know what we need, sure enough within
To the good stuff, the good stuff baby
You got to be real, you got to be real, you got to be sugar
To the good stuff we believe in
You got to, you got to be real

[Intro]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Girl, I got to go
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I got to go now, really
Yeah, I'm kinda in a hurry
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Uh-huh, here's the reason why

[Chorus]
Jump, jump, jump to it
(Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh)
Jump, jump, jump to it
(Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ha, shabadoodledoodweedah)
Jump, jump, jump to it
(Doodoodeedoodoodeedoodoodeedoodoodeedoodoodweedah, ha, ho, ha)
Jump, jump, jump to it
(He, baby, baby)

[Verse 1]
My baby loves me
He told me that
And I never question
That point or fact
There is no fighting
Scandal or shame

Drives me insane

Jump, jump, jump to it
Jump, jump, jump to it

Hey, don't keep me waiting
It's 3:59
Ring-ding, hello, baby
Oh, come please be mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, I can't talk to you now, I got love to get
When my baby calls, I gotta jump to it

Baby baby, sweet baby
You left me hurting in a real cold way

Speak your name

You said I do
And I said I will
I tell you that I'll stay true
And give you just a little time
Wait on me baby
I want you to be all of mine
I just get so blue

[Chorus]
Since you've been gone, baby
(Why'd you do it? why'd you have to do it?)
Since you've been gone

To say the things that made you stray
But ah, babe

Got to get you back somehow

[Verse]
If you had a dollar
And I had a dime
I wonder, could I borrow yours
As easy as you could mine?
Because when you need my love
And I give time after time
And turn around to find me no returns
Then, my friend, you've used my dimes
If there's water in the pitcher
And we both need a drink
To stay alive, my darling
I'd need less water than you'd think

[Chorus]
My love, my love, these things, I swear, I say are true
And all I'm really saying is be as good to me as I am to you
Oh, yeah
Listen to this

[Bridge]
Some people want
But they don't wanna give
They can do all of the wrong in the world
And got the nerve to not understand the meaning of letting me heal
Well, starting today
Tomorrow and forevermore
If you can't find it in your heart to do for me
Then, baby, just don't darken my front door

[Outro]
Baby
I want you to be as good to me as I am to you
Woo, baby
I don't think that's asking you too much to do
Listen
Don't you walk around here
Feeling like you can treat me any old way
Using my love, my time, my heart day, day after day
Oh oh oh oh oh baby, baby
Be as good to me as I am to you
Woo, woo, baby

[Intro]
Oh, come back, baby (Come back, baby)
Baby please don't go (Come back, baby)
Because the way I love you (You wouldn't believe it)

Come back, baby (Come back, baby)
Let's talk it over (Let's work it out now)
Yeah, one more time, oh yeah

[Chorus]
Groovin'
On a Sunday afternoon (Sunday, Sunday)
Groovin'
Couldn't get away too soon (Too soon)

[Verse 1]
I can't imagine anything that's better
The world is ours whenever we're together
There is ain't place I'd like to be instead of

[Chorus]
Groovin'
On a crowded avenue
Groovin'
Anything we like to do

[Verse 2]
There's always lots of things that we could see
We could be anyone we wanna be
And all those happy people, we could meet just

[Chorus]
Groovin'
On a Sunday afternoon
Groovin', baby
I couldn't get away too soon (Too soon)

[Verse 3]
(If we can) We'll keep on spending sunny days this way
(Hold my hand) We're gonna talk and laugh our time away
I feel it coming closer day by day
Life would be ecstacy, you and me, we'll just be

[Chorus]
Groovin'
On a Sunday afternoon
Ah, groovin'
I couldn't get away too soon, baby

[Outro]
'Cause darling, you send me
Groovin' (Just groovin', just groovin')

[Verse 1]
Ain't no way for me to love you
If you won't let me
It ain't no way for me to give you all you need
If you won't let me give all of me

I know that a woman's duty
Is to help and love a man
And that's the way it was planned
Oh, but how can I, how can I, how can I
Give you all the things I can
If you're tying both of my hands?

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, it ain't no way
(Ain't no way)
It ain't no way
(Ain't no way)
It just ain't no way, baby
(Ain't no way)
Ain't no way, baby
(Ain't no way)
It ain't no way for me to love you
If you won't let me

[Bridge]
Stop trying to be someone you're not
How cold and cruel is a man
Who paid too much for what he got?
And if you need me like you say, say you do
Oh, then please, please
Please don't you know that I need you?

[Chorus]
Oh, it ain't no way
I tell you that it ain't no way
It ain't no way, it ain't no way, baby, no
It just ain't no way
It sure ain't no way
It ain't no way for me to love you
If you won't let me

[Outro]
No way
If you won't let me
Ain't no way

[Verse]
Each place I go only the lonely go
Some little small cafe
The songs I know only the lonely know
Each melody recalls a love that used to be
The dreams I dream only the lonely dream
Of lips as warm as May
That hopeless, hopeless game that only the lonely scheme
That soon somewhere, you’ll find a love that used to care
And you recall each fun time
Those picnics at the beach when love was new
It well could be that one time
That a hopeless, a hopeless little dream like that comes true
If you find love hang on to each caress
And never let love go
Oh, you will know, you’ll know the loneliness
The heartbreak that only the lonely know

[Chorus]
Drinking again
Thinking of when you loved me
Having a few
Wishing that you were here

[Verse]
Making the rounds
Buying a round for total strangers
Just being a fool
Cause I keep hoping, hoping, hoping you'll appear
Sure I can borrow a smoke
I can sit here all night and tell these jokers some jokes
But who wants to laugh, who's gonna laugh at a broken heart
Oh, my heart is aching, I swear it's breaking

[Chorus]
And I'm drinking again
Thinking of when you loved me
And I'm trying to get home
With nothing, nothing but a memory

[Outro]
Yes, I'm dying to get home
Dying to get home
And I got nothing but a bottle of beer
And just my memory

[Verse]
What a difference a day made
Twenty-four little hours
Brought the sun and the flowers
Where there used to be rain
My yesterday was blue, dear
Today I'm part of you, dear
My lonely nights are through, dear
Since you said you were mine

[Chorus 1]
What a difference a day makes
There's a rainbow before me
Skies above can't be stormy
Since that moment of bliss, that thrilling kiss

[Chorus 2]
It's heaven when you find romance on your menu
What a difference a day made
And the difference is you

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
I know the difference in my heart is you

[Verse 1]
Baby, I need your good loving
Got to have your love right now, baby
So come and fill my empty arms
And make my life worthwhile
Because I'm not living, baby, I only exist
I'll never laugh, I'll never smile no more
Don't care if I stay like this, because

[Chorus]
Without the one you love
Life is not worthwhile
Without your love, my dear
I'm like a fatherless child
So come and fill my empty arms
And make my life worthwhile

[Verse 2]
When I feel the hurt coming on
I stop and cry like I'm crying
(Right now)
People ask why would a grown man cry
I drop my head and I sigh and reply

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
(Baby, I need your good loving)
Sometimes I feel like a wanderer
(Got to have your love right now)
Searching for peace within
(Baby, I need your good loving)
I need you my darling
(Got to have your love right now)
Like a lost soul needs a friend

[Bridge]
So come and fill my empty arms
And fill my empty life
(Baby, I need your good loving)
Nobody knows the emptiness I feel
(Got to have your love right now)
And I feel it
(Baby, I need your good loving)
Nobody knows the loneliness I feel
(Got to have your love right now)
And I feel it because

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Where are you tonight?
Are you lonely like I am, tonight?
Have we lied to each other about this affair?
If so, don't make me suffer, just tell me you still care

[Chorus]
Have you cried tears like I have at all?
And do you wonder as I do, should I call?
I'll hurt for a lifetime not knowing my fate
Is there still any hope here or am I too late?

[Verse 2]
I wonder, I wonder
Where are you tonight?
Are you painting the town while I just sit around?
It's so wrong when you know our love is so right

[Chorus]

[Outro]

[2x]
I wonder, I wonder
Where are you tonight?

[Chorus 1]
Trouble in mind
Yes I'm blue
But I won't be blue always
Sun is gonna shine
In my back door someday

[Chorus 2]
Trouble in mind
Yes its true
I have almost lost my mind
Never had so much trouble
In my life before

[Chorus 3]
If it don't stop
I'm going right on down to the river
I'm gonna to take my easy chair
And if the blues don't get me
I'm gonna rock on away from here

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 3]

[Chorus 2]
You better believe me
I'm trouble in mind
Oh yes its true
I have almost lost my mind
Never had so much trouble
In my young life before

[Chorus 3]

[Verse]
Say it man, I'm trouble in mind
Yes I'm blue
But I just refuse to be blue always
The sun is gonna shine
In my back door someday

[Outro]
I said I it is, I know it is
Sun is gonna shine in my back door someday
Well I said that I believe that the
Sun is gonna shine in my back door someday
Oh, trouble in mind

[Verse 1]
Baby we’ve got to have us a little talk
Gonna have to pack up my things I’m gonna walk
You say a dollar goes from hand to hand
But before I see you go from woman to woman

[Chorus]
I’d rather drink
Muddy water
Sleep out in a hollow log
Yes, I would

[Verse 2]
I love you baby but you just won’t be fair
I don’t believe you know how to be on the square
Now go on and have your fun and if you must
But before I have another man that I cannot trust

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You promised me you were gonna live by the golden rule
I work all day and walk just like a fool
For you my kisses are sweet as they can be
But before I see you make a stone fool out of me

[Chorus]
I’d rather drink muddy water
Yes I’d rather drink muddy water
I’d rather drink muddy water
Oh yes I would

[Outro]
I’d rather drink muddy water
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes I would
Show me the way, way, way, way, way down
To that place I can find that muddy water
I’ll go ahead and turn it on up
I say I’d rather drink muddy water
I’d rather drink muddy, muddy, muddy water
Sleep out in a hollow log

Was blind, but now I see

Amazing, Amazing Grace! How sweet the, the sound
That, that saved a wretch like me
I once was, was lost, but, but now I, I'm found
Was, was blind, but now, now I, I see

[Verse 2: Aretha Franklin]
Through, through, through, through
Through many dangers, oh oh, dangers, toils, woo Lord, toils and snares
I, I've been right here in the midst of a heaven
But I'm ready, I've already
Jesus was with me and I've already called, yes I have

It was, it was, it was, it was, it was grace amazing
Has been with me, Lord, and let me see
Don't you know it?
And that same, that same old grace
They call it God's amazing, oh oh, amazing
Mmm, Amazing Grace
It was, it was, I want the world to know that it was
It was, it was, it was grace
Woo-hoo, it was grace, Lord
Oh Lord, hath brought me, me so safe
So safe, so safe, so safe, so safe, so safe, so safe thus far

[Verse 1]
Nobody knows, nobody knows
The way I feel this morning
I said, nobody knows
The way I feel this morning
Well, if I only had my way
Let me tell you that
The graveyard would be the place
Where my man would lay

[Chorus]
Nobody, nobody knows
The way I feel this morning

[Verse 2]
Well I pawned everything
Pawned everything I had this morning
Everything, everything
Said that I pawned everything
Everything that I had this morning, yes, I did

But I've got just a, just a little bit of shame

Screaming and crying this morning
Yeah, this morning
Said that I feel like I could scream and cry
Oh, yes, I do, scream and cry this morning

Don't you know I'm just a little too cold hearted

Nobody, nobody knows, nobody understands
How I really, really feel this morning
Oh, early this morning

[Outro]
Love right now-love brother
Love right now-love
And you'll never walk alone

[Verse]
When you walk through a storm
Hold your head, hold it up high
And don't, don't you be afraid
Of the dark
For at the end, at the end of the storm
There is a golden, a golden sky
And sweet silver song
Of the lark

Walk on, walk on through the wind
Get your courage together
Walk on, walk on through the rain
Though your dreams be tossed
I know sometimes they get tossed and they get blown
What you gotta do is walk on

It sounds mighty mighty good to me right now
Walk on with just a little bit of hope
Right on, right on
With just a little bit of hope in your heart
And you'll never, you won't never, I will never
I know that you will never walk alone
You'll never walk alone

[Verse 1]
I have heard of a land on the far away strand
’Tis a beautiful home of the soul
It was built by Jesus, Jesus on high
There, there we'll never, never will die
’Tis a land where we never grow old

[Chorus]
Never grow old, never grow old
In a land where we’ll never grow old
Never grow old, never grow old
In a land where we’ll never grow old

[Verse 2]
In that beautiful home where we’ll never more roam
We shall be in the sweet by and by
Happy praise to the King through eternity sing
’Tis a land where we never shall die

[Chorus]

[Outro]
When our work here is done and the life crown is won
And our troubles and trials are over
All our sorrow will end, and our voices will blend
With the loved ones who’ve gone on before

[Chorus]
I'm an evil gal
Don't you bother with me, no
I said I'm an evil gal
Don't you mess around with me, mhm
Well, I'll empty your pockets and I'll fill you with misery
Yes I will

[Verse 1]
If you tell me, "Good morning"
I'll tell you, "That's a lie"
If you say I'm old, baby
I'll give you an evil eye

[Chorus]
I'm an evil gal
Don't you mess around with me, mhm
I'm gonna empty your pockets and I'll fill you with misery
Yes I will

[Verse 2]
I want caviar for breakfast
Champagne every night
I want a midnight snack
For every man that I invite

[Chorus]
I'm an evil gal
Don't you mess around with me, no
So goodbye, baby
I'm gonna set you free

[Outro]
Well, if you wanna be happy, honey, don't you mess around with me, yeah
Said, if you wanna be happy, don't you mess around with me, no
'Cause I'll empty your pockets and I'll fill you with misery
Yeah yeah, I'm evil

Well, if you wanna be happy, don't you hang out with me no more
I said, if you wanna be happy, honey, don't you hang out with me
You better not
'Cause I'll empty your pockets and I'll set you free
And I'm so jive, yes I am

[Verse 1]
Knew you'd be a vision in white
How'd you get your pants so tight?
Don't know what you're doing
But you must be living right, yeah
We got some places to see
I brought all the maps with me
So jump in, it ain't no sin
Take a ride in my machine

[Pre-Chorus]
City traffic's moving way too slow
Drop the pedal and go, go, go

[Chorus]
We going riding on the freeway of love
Wind's against our back
We going riding on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac
We going riding on the freeway of love
Wind's against our back
We riding on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac

[Verse 2]
Never you mind the exit signs
We got lots of time
We can't quit till we get
To the other side
With the radio playing our song
We keep rolling on
Who knows how far a car can get
Before you think about slowing, slowing down, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
City traffic's moving way too slow
Drop the pedal and go, go, go

[Chorus]
We going riding on the freeway of love
Wind's against our back
We going riding on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac
We going riding on the freeway of love
Wind's against our back
We riding on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac

[Verse 3]
Here we go, one more time
With the wind and your fingers in my hair
Kind of think we are going for an extended throw down
So drop the top, baby, and let's cruise on into
It's Better Than Ever Street

[Pre-Chorus]
City traffic's moving way too slow
Drop the pedal and go, go, go

[Chorus]
We going riding on the freeway of love
Wind's against our back
We going riding on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac
We going riding on the freeway of love
Wind's against our back
We riding on the freeway of love
In my pink Cadillac

[Outro]
And what I want you to do, baby
(freeway of love) get over in the left lane
And let's merge with peace, oh, yeah
(freeway of love) take the love exit
And then make a right turn
(freeway of love) go on over to Love and Satisfaction and Joy Road
Well, ain't we riding baby
Ain't we cruising down?
Free, free, free, freeway go on out to, ow

[Verse]
You want to feel something so sweet and funky
Boy, you can feel it, feel it floating through your soul
The sooner you show up, baby
The sooner you'll have a groove of me to hold on, hold on
But you gotta come and see me, baby
Cause what I got is too much for me to send to you
I want you, would you come on and see me, baby
Because what I, what I got is too much for me to send to you
Now, what I'm going to do is hold it right here on hot ice
Mister, can you pay the price of the postage to you
It was okay yesterday baby, well it ought a be just right tonight
Oh, it was okay yesterday, baby, it ought a be just right
Just right tonight
Cause what I got is called the good stuff
Baby, have you got a good appetite? Yeah

[Bridge]
How long, baby, how long, baby, how long, baby
How long baby, how long, how long, baby, baby, how long
Just how long you going to take?

[Outro]
Somebody just slapped me with a nasty gym shoe
You ought a not be so okay with it
Yeah, put it on me, throw me all the way out in the alley
How long, baby, how long, how long?
I need you, I need you, I need you, baby
I, I, yeah, how long, how long, baby, how long, baby
How long, how, how?

[Intro]
The look in your eyes, baby, just turns me on;
So inviting to me... You know I feel that they're my home

[Verse 1]
(Darling, reach out just for me)
And darling, I had to surrender all my sense of pride;
Your touch from behind on the shoulder's so tender
(The deepness of your eyes

[Chorus]
The wheel of fading fortune's standing
For a long, long, long day, yeah, yeah, hey

[Verse 2]
People say that the eyes tell stories, and they mirror the soul;
Tell me, do we reflect the sameness of one, the unity to have and to hold?
(Darling, reach out just for me)
I tend our love in quiet seclusion - only you can say
If this is love or just an illusion
(The deepness of your eyes)

[Chorus]
I can't stop loving you, baby
(The deepness of your eyes)
I feel the loving all the time, hey
(The deepness of your eyes

[Bridge]
The wheel of fading fortune's standing
For a long, long, winding day, yeah

[Chorus]

[Verse]
This bitter, bitter earth
What fruit it bears
What good is love
That no one wants to share
And if my life, my life is like the dust
That haunts the glows of the rose
Tell me what good am I
Heaven, Heaven, Heaven, Heaven only knows
Ooh, ooh, this, this bitter earth
Well, I found out it can be, be so, be so cold
Today, you're young
And before you know it
Too soon you've grown old

[Bridge]
But while a voice within me cries
Someone, someone may answer my call
And this bitter earth
This bitter, bitter earth
May not, may not be so bitter after all

[Outro]
While a voice within me cries
While this voice within me cries
Someone, someone may answer my call
And this, this bitter earth
This real cold earth
Mmm, may not be so bitter after all, mmm

[Verse 1]
All my friends have to ask if I'm shattered
I say the past is the past and it no longer matters
I made my mind up
I can make it
I'll be fine
Even if I gotta fake it
I'll keep surviving

[Chorus]
Another night
Without you
Another night
I know I can get through
Another night
It's only
Another night
I won't be lonely
Another night, another night
Another night
It ain't much
Another night
Without your touch

[Verse 2]
I used to search through the crowd to find you
But I don't feel like it now
So don't look behind you
You better face it
I won't be calling
I hit my stride when the evening is falling
I'm going to make it

[Chorus]
Another night
Without you
Another night
I know I can get through
Another night
It's only
Another night
I won't be lonely
Another night, another night
Another night
It ain't much
Another night
Without your touch

[Bridge]
Out where the music is loud and the people are laughing
I'm going to step on out
I won't be down
Going to stand my ground for just another night
Oh yes for a another night

[Break]
You were phasing out, my sweet, and I knew it
He didn't give a damn how I got through it
But like you I had someone else too
Always there to keep me warm, no time for blue

[Verse 3]
I made my mind up, I can make it
I'll be fine even if I gotta fake it
I'll keep surviving, yes I will

[Chorus]
Another night
Without you
Another night
I know I can get through
Another night
It's only
Another night
I won't be lonely
Another night, another night
Another night
It ain't much
My man, I don't need you to be bringing me down
Hey, another night, another night
Another night, another night
Another night, another night
Another night, another night
Oh yes it is
I get so restless in my bed
Without you, boy
I'm going to make it
You know I am
I get so restless in my bed

[Intro]
All this time, I couldn't shake your memory
And I never knew the sweetest love was the first
So what am I supposed to do about this curse?
Oh, baby, I've got you to blame
And I'm calling, calling out your name

Oh, he was so fine
Jimmy Lee, oh, he was so fine
Jimmy, Jimmy Lee
(Jimmy Lee)
Jimmy, Jimmy Lee
(Jimmy Lee)

[Verse 1]
Find me rushing off to school every morning
Never had a care
Acting crazy, always laughing when I'm running
'Cause I knew you'd meet me when I got there
Stealing kisses in the hall before the first bell
You smelled so fine
Though we'd just met I guess you knew me so well
You had the number to my heart line

[Pre-Chorus]
(Maybe he knew his stuff)
Well, just between you and me
(Maybe you weren't enough)
He was the first one
(Maybe he'd seen enough)
He stole my heart
And he ran like a bandit
I don't understand it

[Chorus]
Jimmy Lee, this one's for me
And I'll always remember
History, biology, and that magical December, ooh boy
Jimmy Lee, where can you be?
If this song ever finds you
Won't you please explain to me
Why you left me behind you, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
(Jimmy Lee) Jimmy

[Verse 2]
On the average twice a week I think I see you
On some avenue
Someone laughs or shakes his head they way you used to
I guess I got myself a loose screw
I grew up and had my share of adventure
Well, I've had some fun (Oh, I've had fun)
But you never need to question my intentions
'Cause each guy is just another rerun

[Pre-Chorus]
(Maybe he knew his stuff)
Just between you and me
(Maybe you weren't enough)
He was the first one
(Maybe he'd seen enough)
He stole my heart
And he ran like a bandit
I don't understand it, hey, hey

[Chorus]
Jimmy Lee, this one's for me
And I'll always, always remember
History, biology, and that magical, oh, December
Jimmy Lee, where can you be?
If this song ever finds you, yeah yeah yeah
Won't you please explain to me
Why you left me, oh, behind you

[Outro]
Jimmy Lee, this one's for me
(Shadeedeedeedee, oh oh oh oh oh, hey Jimmy, hey Jimmy)

[Verse 1: Aretha Franklin]
Like a warrior that fights and wins the battle
I know the taste of victory
Though I went through some nights consumed by the shadows
I was crippled emotionally

[Pre-Chorus: George Michael and Aretha Franklin]
Somehow I made it through the heartache, yes, I did
Oh, I escaped Aha ha
I found my way out of the darkness
I kept my faith (I know you did), kept my faith

[Chorus: George Michael and Aretha Franklin]
When the river was deep, I didn't falter
When the mountain was high, I still believed
When the valley was low, it didn't stop me, no no
I knew you were waiting, I knew you were waiting for me
Uh huh

[Verse 2: Aretha Franklin]
With an endless desire, I kept on searching
Sure in time our eyes would meet
And like a bridge that's on fire, the hurt is over
One touch and you set me free

[Pre-Chorus: George Michael and Aretha Franklin]
No, I don't regret a single moment, no I don't
(I know you don't) Looking back
When I think of all those disappointments
I just laugh (I know you do), I just laugh

[Chorus: George Michael and Aretha Franklin]
When the river was deep, I didn't falter
When the mountain was high, I still believed
When the valley was low, it didn't stop me, oh
I knew you were waiting, hey, I knew you were waiting for me

[Bridge: Aretha Franklin and George Michael]
So we were drawn together through destiny, ooh boy, ooh!
I know this love we share was meant to be, oh
(Knew you were waiting) Ooh, yeah
(Knew you were waiting) I knew you were waiting
(Knew you were waiting for me)

[Outro: Aretha Franklin and George Michael]
(I didn't falter) I didn't falter, no
(I still believed) When the valley was low
(It didn't stop me) Nothing can stop me, no
(I knew you were waiting) No, I
(I knew you were waiting for me)
(I didn't falter) When the mountain was high
(I still believed) Oh, when the valley was low
(It didn't stop me) No, it didn't stop me, no
(I knew you were waiting)
(I knew you were waiting for me)
(I didn't falter) Oh, oh yeah
(I still believed) Oh, I still believed
(It didn't stop me) Do you know it couldn't stop me now? No
(Knew you were waiting)
Someday (someday), somehow (somehow)
For me
(I didn't falter) When the valley was low
(I still believed) I still believe (I believed, I believed)
(It didn't stop me) Yeah, it couldn't stop me
(I knew you were waiting)
(I knew you were waiting for me)

[Verse 1]
Here in my book of memories
Each page remembers you and me
Running in the rain, laughing in the sunshine
We used to share our kisses and dreams
Now you've gone to some distant shore
What happened to the boy next door?
Wherever you are I wonder if you'd cherish
The special joys we shared yesterday

[Chorus]
Do you still remember?
Do you still recall? (Recall)
Memories so tender
Didn't we have something after all?
Do you still remember?

[Verse 2]
Come here, and let me breathe you in
Ooh, you have haven't lost that same old grin
I know what you want and I'll confess to one thing
It's never been as good as it was then

[Chorus]
Do you still remember?
Do you still recall? (Recall)
Memories so tender
Didn't we have something after all? Ooh

[Bridge]
Why we fought each other?
I will never know
But I can´t seem to shake the past
If we had another chance to make it go
I wonder could we make it last?
Oh

[Chorus]
Do you still remember?
Do you still recall?
Memories so tender (Oh, so tender)
Didn't we have something after all?
(I'm so glad that you stopped by last night, baby)
Do you still remember?
(Oh yeah, yes, I am, yeah)
Do you still recall? (Still recall)
Memories so tender
(Ooh, ooh, you're so good to me, boy)
Didn't we have something after all?
(Yeah)
Do you still remember?
Do you still recall? (Still recall)
(Come on, come on, come on, come on with your come on, baby)
Memories so tender
(You know we had it all)

[Verse 1]
I was born in a cross-fire hurricane
And I howled at my ma in the driving rain, woo, yeah

[Chorus]
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas!
But it's all right, jumping jack flash
It's a gas, gas, gas, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
I was raised by a toothless, bearded hag
I was schooled with a strap right across my back, oh, yes I was

[Chorus]
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right, jumping jack flash
It's a gas, gas, gas

[Break]

[Verse 3]
I was drowned, I was washed up and left for dead, oh, yes I was
I fell down to my feet and I saw they bled, woo
I frowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread, yes I did
I was crowned with a spike right through my head, yeah

[Chorus]
But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right, jumping jack flash
It's a gas, gas, gas, yes it is

[Outro]
Jumping jack flash, it's a gas
Jumping jack flash, it's a gas
Jumping jack flash, it's a gas
Jumping jack flash, it's a gas
Jumping jack flash, it's a gas
Jumping jack flash, it's a gas
Jumping jack flash, it's a gas
Jumping jack flash, it's a gas
Jumping jack flash, it's a gas
Jumping jack flash, it's a gas
Jumping jack flash, it's a gas
Jumping jack flash, it's a gas
Jumping jack flash, it's a gas
Hallelujah

Rock, rock, rock...
It's time to jam, y'all
Freeze! Get up against the wall!
And let's rock, hey
Ooh, ooh, yeah

[Verse 1]
No longer will I do
All the things that I used to do
Stood by your side in innocence
For my love was just for you
Well, I'm a big girl now
With big needs and desires
So don't you come around
If you can't take me higher

[Chorus]
I like to rock a lot, so my love won't wait
(Oh no, it won't, boy)
I like to rock a lot, that's how it is of lately

Rock, rock, rock...
Oh, yeah, I like to party
Yeah, ooh

[Verse 2]
I think it's my turn this time
Not a soul gets burned
Games never had no place with me
Jamming is my concern
Just give me one good man
To keep me satisfied
Have you gone underground
And if so, where will you hide, sweet thing?
Hey!

[Chorus]
I like to rock a lot, so my love won't wait
(Oh no, it won't)
I like to rock a lot, that's how it is of lately
(Yeah, baby)
I like to rock a lot, I'll take a pair and a spare
(Oh, baby)
I like to rock a lot, big boy, are you out there?

Step on the funk now
Well, well
Raise the funk, y'all

[Bridge]
It's time to rock with Re-Re
Yes, it is!
Rocking is my soul's desire
And I am going to set you on fire!

I tried to warn you
I tried to warn you
Yeah, yeah

[Outro]
I like it, I like it
I like it, I like it

[Verse 1: Aretha Franklin and Larry Graham]
Inside my mind the hands of time rewind
To when you’re love was mine so magically
We shared a song and even though it’s gone
I can still recall the melody
Don’t be scared if you lie awake in the dark (I won’t be afraid, baby)
'Cause I still truly care with all my heart

[Chorus: Aretha Franklin & Larry Graham ]
If you need my love tonight all you have to do is call me
And I’m always here when you need a friend
If you need my love tonight I promise to keep you from falling
And I’ll stay with you if you need my love tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight

[Verse 2: Aretha Franklin and Larry Graham]
So soft and pure, your love was the cure
Then I felt lost and so alone
Now it’s my turn to give you what you yearn
Return the love that you have always shown
And what a joy if I could see you once again
(Oh, I see you tonight, baby)
I will treat you so right you’re my body and soul

[Chorus: Aretha Franklin & Larry Graham ]
If you need my love tonight all you have to do is call me
And I’m always here when you need a friend
If you need my love tonight I promise to keep you from falling
And I’ll stay with you if you need my love tonight
Tonight
Oh, tonight
I'll be there, yeah
If you need my love tonight all you have to do is call me
And I’m always here when you need a friend
If you need my love tonight I promise to keep you from falling
And I’ll stay with you if you need my love tonight
If you need my love tonight all you have to do is call me
And I’m always here when you need a friend
Tonight

[Verse 1]
On the day I was born, said my father, said he
“Here’s an elegant legacy waiting for ye
Here the song for your lips and a rhyme for your heart
Sing it whenever the world falls apart”

[Chorus]
Look, look, look to the rainbow
Follow it over the hills and the sea
Oh look, oh look, look to the rainbow
Oh, and then follow the fellow who follows the dream

[Verse 2]
So I bundled my heart and I roamed the world free
To the east with a lark, to the west with the sea
And I roamed over the Earth and I scanned all of the skies
And I found out, found out in my own true love’s eyes

[Chorus]
Look, look, look to the rainbow
Follow it over the hills and the sea
Oh look, oh look, look to the rainbow
Oh, and then follow the fellow who follows the dream
Look, look, look to the rainbow
Follow it over the hills and the sea
Oh look, oh look, look to the rainbow
Oh, and then follow the fellow who follows the dream

[Intro: Aretha Franklin]
These are ever changing times

[Refrain: Aretha Franklin]
I see that clock upon the wall
But it don't bother me at all
These are ever changing times

[Verse 1: Aretha Franklin]
And the, ever changing time
Everything is going so much faster
It seems like I'm
Watching my life, and everything I do
Wondering if the dreams that I believed in
Can still come true

[Chorus: Aretha Franklin]
Caught in between, it comes back to
You and me running out of time
I got to find me a better understanding
Every day, keep forgetting what's mine
I got to find me a way, less demanding
And we're holding on so tight, together, all of our lives

[Verse 2: Aretha Franklin]
And I, I had some big idea
So much of my life, still not completed, hopes and fears
Watching it change, into something new
Wondering it I'm going to find the answer, loving you

[Chorus: Aretha Franklin]
All of my life, it comes back to
You and me running out of time
I got to find me a better understanding
Every day, keep forgetting what's mine
I got to find me a way, less demanding
And we're holding on so tight, together, all of our lives

[Refrain: Michael McDonald]
I see, that clock upon the wall
But it don't bother me at all
These are ever changing times
I see, that clock upon the wall
But it don't bother me at all
These are ever changing times

[Chorus: Aretha Franklin & Michael McDonald]
All of my life, it comes back to
You and me running out of time
I got to find me a better understanding
Every day, keep forgetting what's mine
I got to find me a way, less demanding
And we're holding on so tight, together
And we're gonna be alright, together, all of our lives

[Outro: Michael McDonald]
I see that clock upon the wall
But it don't bother me at all
These are ever changing times
I see that clock upon the wall
But it don't bother me at all
These are ever changing times
I see that clock upon the wall
But it don't bother me at all
These are ever changing times
I see that clock upon the wall
But it don't bother me at all
These are ever changing times
I see that clock upon the wall
But it don't bother me at all
These are ever changing times
I see that clock upon the wall
But it don't bother me at all
These are ever changing times

[Verse]
It's an evil wind
That blows no good, yeah
It's a sad heart
That won't love like I know it should
Oh how lonesome
(Oh how lonesome)
You must be
(You must be)
It's a shame
(Shame, shame)
If you don't share your love with me
It's a heartache, yeah
(It's a heartache)
When love is gone
(Baby it's a heartache)
But it's bad
(Bad)
And even sad
(Sad)
Oh later on
And there's no one blinder
Than you won't see
It's a shame
(Shame, shame)
If you don't share some of your love with me
I can't help it, oh no
He is gone
I must try to forget
Because I've got to live on
Oh, it's a good thing it's a sweet thing
(It's a sweet thing)
To love someone
(Such a sweet thing)
But it's bad
(Bad)
And even sad
(Sad)
When it's not returned
Oh, how lonesome, how lonesome, how lonesome
(Oh how lonesome)
You must be
(You must be)
I tell you it would be a shame
(Shame, shame)
A shame if you don't share your love with me
(Share your love with me)
It would really be a mistake baby
(Shame, shame)
If you don't share your love with me
(Share your love with me)
It would sure be a shame
(Shame, shame)
If you don't share, share your love with me
(Share your love with me)

[Intro: Aretha Franklin & Whitney Houston]
It isn't, it wasn't, it ain't never gonna be
It isn't, it wasn't, it ain't never gonna be, yeah

[Verse 1: Aretha Franklin]
You've been hangin' 'round my boyfriend
You've been sayin' that he's sweet, yeah
Well, girl, I know that you've been talkin'
Because that talk is on the street
You say that you are gonna steal his heart
Well, sweetie, you ain't gonna get that far
You're after somethin' that don't belong to you
Well, girlfriend, I've got news for you
What are you trying to say, Miss Thang? Huh

[Chorus: Both, Aretha Franklin]
It isn't, it wasn't, it ain't never gonna be
It isn't, it wasn't, it ain't never gonna be
He ain't never, ever, never, never, never
Never, never, never, never, never, never
Gonna be your man

[Post-Chorus: Aretha Franklin & Whitney Houston]
Ah, oh, yeah
Oh, ooh
Hey

[Verse 2: Whitney Houston & Aretha Franklin]
Well, I just ain't the kind of woman
To pick the fruit off of your tree, girl
And you keep sayin' that is your man
But that ain't what he said to me
See, he blows me kisses as he drives away
He sends me roses in the middle of the day, yeah
You think it's you that he's thinkin' of
But I'm the one that he really, really loves, girl
So what am I trying to say? Don't diss me, girl

[Chorus: Both, Whitney Houston & Aretha Franklin]
I said, it isn't, it wasn't, it ain't never gonna be
It isn't, it wasn't, it ain't never gonna be
He ain't never, ever, never, never, never
Never gonna be yours (Sing)
It isn't, it wasn't, it ain't never gonna be
Oh, it isn't, it wasn't, it ain't never gonna be
He ain't never, ever, never, never, never
Never gonna be your man, girl

[Interlude: Aretha Franklin, Whitney Houston & Both]
What are you doin', layin' and hangin' back?
Don't you know it, girl?
Mmhmm, just as I suspected (Hey)
You been talkin' that la-la, and that ya-ya
And that yin and that yang, but the man is mine
Hey

[Bridge: Aretha Franklin & Whitney Houston]
He blows me kisses as he drives away
He sends me flowers in the middle of the day, yeah
You think it's you that he's thinkin' of
I know I'm the one that he really, really, really loves
What am I tryin' to say Miss It?
What are you tryin' to say?
Get real

[Chorus: Both, Aretha Franklin & Whitney Houston]
It isn't, it wasn't, it ain't never gonna be
It isn't, it wasn't, it ain't never gonna be
He ain't never (No), ever (No), never (No), never (No), never (No)
Never gonna be yours (Sing)
It isn't, it wasn't, it ain't never gonna be
Oh, it isn't, it wasn't, it ain't never gonna be
He ain't never (No), ever (No), never (No), never (No), never (No)
Never gonna be your man
Be your man

[Interlude: Aretha Franklin & Whitney Houston]
That's Aretha
Oh, woah
Ah (Yeah, yeah)
So now, what is this?
Well, you know
And my man is supposed to be interested in you?
That's what I'm saying
You know, I realize that you're under pressure
Yes, I am
That you're suffering from delusions
Well
Don't be ridiculous
I'm not
Get real
You better get real

[Chorus: Both, Aretha Franklin & Whitney Houston]
It isn't, it wasn't, it ain't never gonna be
It isn't, it wasn't, it ain't never gonna be
He ain't never (No), ever (No), never (No), never (No), never (No)
Never gonna be yours (Sing)
It isn't, it wasn't, it ain't never gonna be
Oh, it isn't, it wasn't, it ain't never gonna be

It isn't, it wasn't, it ain't never gonna be

[Intro: Aretha Franklin & Elton John]
Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah yeah yeah
Ooh, yeah yeah, oh
Ooh baby
Ooh baby, mmm

[Verse 1: Elton, Aretha, Both]
In this world it's hard, you know
Lovers come and lovers go
People never seem to hold on to what they've got, no no
Some they never stay together
You and I will be no better
We can make it last forever
We can keep this love alive

[Chorus: Aretha Franklin & Elton John]
Through the storm
Through the tears
You and I
I know we can survive
To the day
Through the night
If we try we can keep it alive
We can keep it alive

[Verse 2: Aretha, Elton, Both]
I know sometimes it's been so tough
We've been so close to giving up
Hey, but our love's so strong
And we keep holding on, yeah
To what we got, ooh ooh ooh
It's easier to walk away
It takes a lot of love to stay
Ah, we've got all the love it takes
We know there's a brighter day

[Chorus: Aretha Franklin & Elton John]
Through the storm
Through the tears
You and I
I know we can survive
To the day
Through the night
If we try we can keep it alive
We can keep it alive

[Bridge: Aretha Franklin & Elton John]
We just gotta be strong
We just gotta be strong
We just gotta be strong together
We just gotta hold on
We just gotta hold on
We just gotta hold on and go through the storm
Yeah yeah, through the storm
Oh, yeah yeah yeah
I know we're gonna make it

[Chorus: Aretha Franklin & Elton John]
Through the storm (Hey)
Through the tears (Through the tears)
You and I (You and I)

To the day (To the day)
Through the night (To the night)
If we try (Girl, if we try) we can keep it alive
We can keep it alive
Through the storm (Oh, through the storm)
Through the tears (Through the tears)
You and I (Oh, you and I)
I know we can survive
To the day (To the day)
Through the night (Oh, through the night)
If we try (Hey) we can keep it alive

Through the storm

[Outro: Aretha Franklin & Elton John & Both]
Ha, woo

We're outta here
Yes
Sing it
Dee-dee, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Dee-dee, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Dee-dee, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

[Verse 1]
You're asking me to
Understand your feelings
To just forget about my own
And let you go
Darling, I won't raise a hand to stop you
Just let me say one thing before you go

[Chorus]
Come to me whenever you get lonely
Just reach out your hand and there I'll be
My love will light your way out of the darkness
If you ever need a true love, come to me

[Verse 2]
I believe that time alone will change you
The changing tides will bring you back to me
And when you grow tired of chasing rainbows
Just make a wish for love and there I'll be

[Chorus]
Come to me whenever you get lonely
Just reach out your hand and there I'll be
Oh, my love will light your way out of the darkness
If you ever need a true love, come to me
Come to me whenever you get lonely
Just reach out your hand and there I'll be
My love will light your way out of the darkness
If you ever need a true love, come to me, sweet baby
Come to me whenever you get lonely
Just reach out your hand and there I'll be
My love will light your way out of the darkness
If you ever need a true love, come to me
Come to me whenever you get lonely
Just reach out your hand and there I'll be
My love will light your way out of the darkness
If you ever need a true love, come to me, yeah

[Intro]
I am everyday people, yeah yeah
Yo Gang, let’s kick the ballistics
Let’s party big time, oh
Get up everybody, Oh whoo yeah

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I'm right, I can be wrong
My own beliefs are in my song
A thinker, a banker, a drummer and then
Makes no difference what group I'm in

[Chorus]
I am everyday people, yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
There is a blue one (uh-huh) that don’t accept the green one (what you say)
Cracking on the fat one (uh-huh), like I’m about to be a skinny one (oh)
Different strokes for different folks, and so on and so
Scooby dooby doo-yaa-doo-yaa-doo
Oh sha sha - we got to live together

[Verse 3]
I am no better and neither are you
We’re basically the same whatever we do
First you love me and then you hate me, you think you know me and then
You can't figure out if 

[?]

[Chorus]
I am everyday people, yeah yeah

[Verse 4]
There is a cone head (uh-huh) that don't accept the dome head (what you say)
Sisters and brothers (uh-huh) let's be cool with each other (oh)
Different strokes for different folks, and so on and so on
Etcetera, etcetera
Oh sha sha - we got to live together, yeah

[Breakdown]
This track is killing me
Lord have mercy
Go go, go queen of soul
Go go, go queen of soul
Go go, go queen of soul
Go go, go queen of soul

[Verse 5]
There is a yellow one (yellow one)
That ain't into the red one (red one)
We don't about the black one (black one)
Ha, What about white one y'all? (white one)
Different lengths don’t come with no dress
And so on and so on
Scooby dooby doo-bee-doo-yaa-doo

[Chorus]
I am everyday people, yeah yeah
I am everyday people, yeah yeah

[Brekadown]
Want to take you higher
Higher, Higher

[Chorus]
I am everyday people, yeah yeah
I am everyday people, yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
I saw your face as I hurried past the cafe
And the rain felt like long lost tears
As it trickled down the window pane
And in a moment
All the years were simply washed away
'Cause when our eyes met, when our eyes met
There was nothing left to say
I caught my breath, I fell out of touch with time
'Cause it was you
With a part of me I'd forgotten that I ever knew
I stood to greet you and you held me
Just a little bit too long
Oh, but we've come so far, we've come so far
But the feeling's still so strong

[Chorus]
If ever a love there was
If ever two stars were crossed
If ever a dream was lost
Then it was yours and mine
If ever a touch was right
Or a future looked bright
If ever a love there was

[Verse 2]
That same perfume
Carries such a lot of memories of a time
When we dreamed sweet dreams
Never knowing they'd be left behind
Love is a memory, like a picture
And it never seems to fade
Oh, and I still believe, and I still believe
All the promises we made

[Chorus]
If ever a love there was
If ever two stars were crossed
If ever a dream was lost
Then it was yours and mine
If ever a touch was right
Or a future looked bright
If ever a love there was

[Bridge]
And I still believe, I still believe
All the promises we made

[Chorus]
If ever a love there was
If ever two stars were crossed
If ever a dream was lost
Then it was yours and mine
If ever a touch was right
Or a future looked bright
If ever a love there was

[Verse 1]
Boyfriend I'm true to you, don't make me blue
I thought we had together and that everything was going okay
But than you started showing me another side of you
I've never seen before

[Chorus 1]
Nothing that I would do was ever enough for you boy, ooh baby
And that you're driving our Mercedes Benz
Loaned you a little cash to spend
But still that just wasn't enough, oh no

[Chorus 2]
'Cause what you see always seems to be what you sweat
Ooh, you're never satisfied, you're always wanting something better, yeah
That's the way you are, wanting more and more and more

[Verse 2]
My friends all think I'm crazy after everythin' that I know about you
I'm still having mixed emotions boy, they just don't want to fade away

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Bridge]
He's sweating, he's got to conquer, he's sweating by the hour
He's sweating, he's got the taste, still sweating on the flower
He's sweating, he can't stand it
He's making moves that's how he planned it
He's not satisfied with the best, he got to check out all the rest

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Outro] 

[x2]
What you see, you're never satisfied
Always wanting something better

[Intro]
Mmm, my darling, my darling
Ooh, darling

[Verse 1]
Now I know that you've been staying at home, baby
Yeah, all alone
And I've been working day and night, baby
(Just working day and night)
I know that you've been tired of hearing the same old song
(Baby, I don't really blame ya)
For feeling all that you feel

[Pre-Chorus]
It seems we've got a problem
I swear I'll compromise
I've been working really hard just to make it right
So I'm never gonna leave you again
I'll never leave you again
Ooh

[Chorus]
It's been a long long time since I've seen your smile
Since I felt your touch
Ooh, I miss you so much
I've been gone for so long
And I know I was wrong
So I'm never going to leave you again
I'll never going to leave you again

[Verse 2]
And sometimes I get caught up in things that I do
And boy, I never pay attention at time
(It passes so fast)
Although I call you on the phone
Honey, I get a thing
Only one thing about reality
I feel like a fool, and I do

[Pre-Chorus]
You could be spending time with somebody else
But instead you're still at home
All alone night and day
So I'm never going to leave you again
I'll never leave you again

[Bridge]
Ooo-hooo
Sha-bi-du-day, wee-woo-bi-du-du-woop-du-du-doo
Wa-di-du-du-du-dub-di-du-du oh oh
Zip-zipn-zip-du-du-zipn-zipn-dip-yeah yeah
Wab-web-wab-web-wa-waa-waaaa

[Outro]
I promise that I'll never leave ya
I hope you know I swear
And if you ever have a problem
Call my name and I'll be there
All I want is you to let me back into your arms
And I'm staying by your side
Give me a chance

Oh, it seems we've got a problem
I swear I'll compromise
I've been working day and night just to make it right, baby
Never going to leave you again
I'll never leave you again., oh, whoa whoa
Well, I'm never going to leave you again
I'll never leave you again, oh oh, yeah, yeah
I'm going to be right by your side, oh baby, yeah yeah
I ain't going nowhere, hey yeah, oh yeah
Dip-di-du-du-du-du-du
Dip-di-du-du-du-du-du
Dip-di-du-du-du-du-du
I ain't really going nowhere

[Verse 1]
Something is wrong, baby
Is the feeling gone, baby?
Maybe I need to refresh your mind
Think about the love we shared
Think back to the time we cared
Maybe you can find a reason to be here

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm the one who loved you, mmm
I'm the one who made it right
I'm the one who was there for you
On those cold and lonely nights
I'm the one who held you up
When the world came down on you
And I'm the one who's in love with you
And whose love never stops

[Chorus]
In case you forgot
I give love, ooh, and my love is so good
In case you forgot
I was there when you fell 'cause I care
In case you forgot
I left you satisfied all those nights
In case you forgot
I give love and my love never stops, oh...

[Verse 2]
Where did mine go? (Where did it go)
I never shoulda really let you know
You're about to make a big mistake
Now where do you think you find a love at all like mine?
Maybe all you're gonna find is heartache

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm the one who loved you
And I'm the one who made it right
I'm the one who was there for you
On those cold, cold and lonely nights
I'm the one who held you up
When the world came down on you
And I am the one who was there for you
And whose love never stops

[Chorus]
In case you forgot
I give love, Ooh, and my love is so good
In case you forgot
I was there when you fell 'cause I care
In case you forgot
I left you satisfied all those nights
In case you forgot
I give love and my love never stops

[Bridge]
Where will you go to find someone to love you like I do?
You can play anything, baby, 'cause you know that it's true
Sometimes a love like mine comes just once in your life
So you better, better take it, baby, and hold on tight

[Chorus]
In case you forgot
I give love, and my love is so good
In case you forgot
I was there when you fell 'cause I care
In case you forgot
I left you satisfied all those nights
In case you forgot
I give love and my love never stops

[Outro]
In case you forgot
In case you forgot
Remember me, hey, remember me, baby
In case you forgot
I was there when you fell 'cause I care
In case you forgot
I left you satisfied all those nights
In case you forgot
I give love and my love never stops

[Intro]
Come on now
Oh'oh'ho'ho'oh'
Here we, here we, here we go again
Well, boy

[Verse 1]
I caught you slipping (mmm), ooh, you must be trippin'
'Cause now I know, oh, yes I know, mmm
About your other girls in your past, in your black book
A very long time ago, oh'ho'oh'ho'
Well, you must think I'm crazy
You must think I'm blind
If you want to keep me, boy
Then stop wasting my time

[Chorus]
Here we go again
It's the same old song
You're thinking you're gon' do me
Like the other ones before, baby
Here we go again
It's the same old song
Ooh, straighten up your act
Or else I'm walking out the door

[Verse 2]
All this time (all this time) I thought that I (I)
Was the one who had the problem, oh yeah, mmm
I gave you everything, hoping things might change
But still you ain't around, so, whoa'oh'oh'
You must think I'm foolish (oh yeah)
You must think I'm blind (Do you think I'm blind?)
If you want (if you want) my precious love (my precious love)
Then stop telling me lies (stop wasting, wasting my time)

[Chorus]
Here we go again
It's the same old song
You're thinking you're gon' do me
Like the other ones before, baby
Here we go again
It's the same old song
Ooh, straighten up your act
Or else I'm walking out the door

[Bridge]
You know I've tried to give you the world
Oh, and everything that you need, oh'oh'
Oh, I tried (I) so many times (so many times)
You still mistreated me, oh, here we go

[Chorus]
Here we go again
It's the same old song
You're thinking you're gon' do me
Like the other ones before, baby
Here we go again
It's the same old song
Ooh, straighten up your act
Or else I'm walking out the door
Here we go again
It's the same old song
You're thinking you're gon' do me
Like the other ones before, baby
Here we go again
It's the same old song
Ooh, straighten up your act
Or else I'm walking out the door
Here we go again
It's the same old song
You're thinking you gon' do me
Like the other ones before, baby
Here we go again
It's the same old song
Ooh, straighten up your act
Or else I'm walking out the door...

[Intro]
I had a dream

[Verse]
I had a dream of days gone by
When hopes were high
And life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
And then I dreamed that God would be forgiving
That I was young and I was unafraid
And dreams were made and used and tasted
There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung, nothing was wasted

[Bridge]
Then the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your dreams apart
As they turn your dreams
To shame, shame, shame, shame
He walked the summer
He walked the summer by my side
He filled my days with endless wonder
He took my childhood in his stride
Oh, but he was gone when autumn came
Oh yes he was

[Outro]
And still I dream
I stand right here and dream he'll come to me
ANd then we will, then we will
Then we will live this life together
But there are dreams that cannot
That cannot, that cannot be
And there, there are storms that we cannot weather
I had a dream, had a dream
Listen, world, I had a dream
That life would be so different, so different
Whatever happened to it? Oh, the dream, yeah
So different from what it seems to be
Life will not kill the dream
That I dream, uh uh, no no, no no
So different from what it seems to be
Life must not kill the dream
That we dream, oh, oh, oh no

[Intro]
Hear me, baby
Hear me, hear me, hear me, hear me, hear me
Hear me, boy

[Verse 1]
Nobody knows me
Not like the way you know me
Nobody showed me
The ways of love
So now when you hold me
And you promise you won't control me
My mama told me
To always be for sure

[Chorus]
I want to know
Will you love me
I want to know
Will you care
In the morning
Oh, I want you to treat me right
I don't want you to play with my life
I don't want to be the other woman
I want us to matter and mean something
I want to be with you
But before I do...

[Verse 2]
I want you to fill me
I'm ready and oh so willing
I'm willing to give you
Every part of me
So come on and soothe me, baby
I want you to touch and move me
You can consume me
Take all of me, my love

[Chorus]
I want to know
Will you love me
I want to know
Will you care
In the morning
Oh baby, I want you to treat me right
Oh, you can't, you can't, you can't play with my life
I don't want to be the other woman
No no no no no no
I want us to matter and mean something
I want to be with you
But before I do...

[Bridge]
I want to know
Do we have an understanding?
I've got to know
Are you giving or demanding?
I can't give you no more
'Cause I've poured out my soul
All for you
All for you
I wanna to know
Is there someone else you're loving?
Tell me, have you got another woman?
Would you be a good man?
Come on and make a true stand
Can we share our lives?

[Outro]
I want to know
Will you love me
I want to know
Will you care
In the morning
In the morning, baby; in the morning, baby
In the morning, baby, baby, baby, yeah yeah yeah
I want to know, yeah
I don't want to be the other woman
I want us to matter and mean something
I want to be with you
Oh, but before I do...
I want to know
Will you love me
I want to know
Will you care
In the morning
In the morning, baby; in the morning, baby
I want you to treat me right
I'm ain't gon' let you play with my life
I don't want to be the other woman
I want us to matter and mean something

[Intro]
(When it hurts too much to stay)

[Verse 1]
Some guys are jealous, can't get it right
When did I wander into love with hindsight?
And the feeling turns to bad
I've always been devoted to you
Don't want to give up but I'm losing myself
Somewhere between our love

[Chorus]
When it hurts too much to stay
Because all of these years
Has brought all of these tears
Has brought all of this pain
And it all stays the same
I'll dip, I'll pack my bags and go

[Verse 2]
My heart is aching
It sings every day
Too many emotions that won't go away
I'm afraid to leave you...
Oh baby, can't sleep at night
And I'm lonely all day
Said I'll love you forever
But I'm on my way
Oh yeah, got to move on with me life, hey hey

[Chorus]
When it hurts too much stay
Because all of these years
Has brought all of these tears
Has brought all of this pain
And it all stays the same
I'll dip; I'll pack my bags and go
When it hurts too much stay
Because all of these years
Has brought all of these tears
Has brought all of this pain
And it all stays the same
I'll dip; I'll pack my bags and go

[Bridge]
I should have seen it coming before now
I'm yet to see if I can find my own space, baby
Nothing else for so long
I've made up my mind
I've made up my way

[Chorus]
When it hurts too much stay
Because all of these years
Has brought all of these tears
Has brought all of this pain
And it all stays the same
I'll dip; I'll pack my bags and go
When it hurts too much stay
Because all of these years
Has brought all of these tears
Has brought all of this pain
And it all stays the same
I'll dip; I'll pack my bags and go
When it hurts too much stay
Because all of these years
Has brought all of these tears
Has brought all of this pain
And it all stays the same
I'll dip; I'll pack my bags and go

[Verse 1]
This is my life, and it's my right to live
The way I want to live each day
That's what I want to say
And this is my song
And for too long I sang someone else's melody
It wasn't really me
Somehow I took myself for granted
In someone else's eyes

[Chorus]
I saw reflections of a girl I was who caught me by surprise
Seeing a woman who's defined by you, I never realized
I can't love you, I can't love me through someone else's eyes

[Verse 2]
You were the sun, I was the one who just
Revolved around you day and night
You were my only life, but if I were free
Baby, I'd take control of everything inside of me
Find who I want to be
I'd never take myself for granted
In someone else's eyes

[Chorus]
I saw reflections of a girl I was who caught me by surprise
Seeing a woman who's defined by you, I never realized
I can't love you, I can't love me through someone else's eyes

[Bridge]
I got to show myself I can still exist without a man
Got to finally take control, got to see myself as whole with you
Though you're not the one to blame, I was lost inside your name
And I'll never be the same 'til I find a way back home again
In someone else's eyes

[Chorus]
I saw reflections of a girl I was who caught me by surprise
Seeing a woman who's defined by you, I never realized
I can't love you, I can't love me through someone else's eyes

[Bridge]
Got to find my way back home again
Through someone else's eyes

[Chorus]
I saw reflections of a girl I was who caught me by surprise
Seeing a woman who's defined by you, I never realized
I can't love you, I can't love me through someone else's eyes

[Outro]
Ooh, someone, someone else's eyes, no baby, ooh
Someone else's eyes, can't do it, I can't do it
I, I love you, sweet baby, I want to be with you, baby
Through someone else's eyes, ooh
Someone else's eyes, oh baby
Ooh, oh yeah, someone else's eyes
I want to be by your side
Oh, but you hurt this lady's pride

[Verse 1: Luther Vandross & Aretha Franklin]
Hopping, hopping, 'til I'm energized
'Cause I got something on my mind
(What is it, baby?)
So I, I said to my baby, leave the job early
'Cause I got a thing for you that's killing me
(I like that stuff)
You really know just how to thrill me
You lay those pretty little words on me
So I'll be the doctor, let me work on you
(I'm ready)
And then I'll prescribe the things we gonna do
(Okay)

[Chorus: Luther & Aretha]
The doctor's orders said, get some love (Oh yeah)
Said you've been goin' without it long enough, long enough
So here I am, boy, to hook you up
And that's exactly what I'm dreamin' of
Ooh, boy, my boy

[Verse 2: Luther & Aretha]
I love it when you get sentimental (Ah baby)
You can't be a no way but sweet and gentle
You know what to do when the world falls in
You give me the sweetest kind of medicine
I'm wit' you, with you, baby
One kiss from you would be
The world's sweetest kind of surgery
So you'll be the doctor, boy, won't you be
And write up a love prescription just for me
(I'm hanging with you, baby Hang with me, baby)

[Bridge]
I spoke to the main man at that love pharmacy
So let me just tell you, exactly what you need
I'll show you the directions but be sure you'll read the warning
(Say what?)
Try two kisses and then call me in the morning
(Okay)

[Chorus: Luther & Aretha]
The doctor's orders said to get some love
Said you've been goin' without it long enough, long enough
So here I am, girl, to hook you up
And that's exactly what I'm dreamin' of
Ooh, girl, my girl

[Bridge]
(Fever) Fever has got a hold on you
(I see a love fever) And you can hardly make it
(I got fever) Fever, ooh, about a hundred-zero-two
(A love fever) Fever and you don't think you can take it, help me

Oh, it's hot
(Say, oh, oh, oh)
Oh, I'm burning with the fever
(Oh, oh, oh)
(The doctor said)
What did he say?
(To get some love)
And
(And I'm so, I'm so, I'm so in love with you, baby)
You know you better be listening to what the doctor said

[Verse 3: Luther & Aretha]
I feel better now, I don't know how
We did it, but we did
Will you keep hugging me and working me?
And don't you ever quit it
(Ooh, boy)
So get out of bed the doctor said
'Cause you're the cure I need
For anything that's wrong with me
I'm hanging with you, baby
(Hang with me, baby)

[Chorus: Luther & Aretha]
The doctor's order said, get some love
Hang with me, baby
Said, you've been going without it long enough
Stay right in, hang with me, baby
Here I am, boy, to hook you up
That's exactly what I'm dreaming of

[Outro: Luther, Aretha, Both]
The doctor said, love, doctor said, love and get you some love
Get to my love, get to my love, got to be love
Got to be love
So here I am, boy, to hook you up
That's exactly what I'm dreaming of, yeah
The doctor's order said, get some love
When do you want it?
Said, you've been going without it long enough
Oh, how do you want it?
Here I am to hook you up
That's exactly what I'm dreaming of

[Verse 1]
You used to tell me you loved me
You used to show me you cared
I used to be the one that you adored
But lately I don't feel you love me no more

[Pre-Chorus]
You see, I don't understand what's come over you
And I don't understand why I let you treat me so cruel
So tell me...

[Chorus]
How many times must I break down and cry?
I'm confused
My understanding was true love should never die
How many times will you kill me inside?
Any kind of fool should see the light
So why can't I?

[Verse 2]
Time after time, I have tried and tried
To give you some space and some time
But no matter what I do it is never enough
You just refuse to try to do by me right

[Pre-Chorus]
Though I know I still believe
Something's got a hold on me
Can't seem to find the strength to set myself free
So tell me...

[Chorus]
How many times must I break down and cry?
I'm confused
My understanding was true love should never die
How many times will you kill me inside?
Any kind of fool should see the light
So why can't I?

[Bridge]
I gave my heart and soul; I gave my all, you know
I deserve better, baby
Oh so much better, baby
You know it's just not fair
For you to act like just don't care
For you to act like I've done something wrong
Boy, how could you dare

[Chorus]
How many times must I break down and cry?
I'm confused
My understanding was true love should never die
How many times will you kill me inside?
Any kind of fool should see the light
Why can't I?
How many times must I break down and cry?
I'm confused
My understanding was true love should never die
How many times will you kill me inside?
Any kind of fool should see the light
But why can't I?
You're wrong, you know it

[Verse 1: OJ da Juiceman]
Hold up, Hold up, Big rang, Big watch, crushed ice
Young Juiceman and I'm shining like the street light
Step off in the club and my chain say goodnight
Baby girl you foolish if you think the kid ain't wrapped tight
Maserati cope in the blue in over night
Sprite mixed pink you can call that a pink sprite
And the way I live, You can call that street life
VVS diamonds everybody say goodnight

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & OJ da Juiceman]
Gucci: 20 bricks a night make your girl say goodnight

Swag so stupid and my diamonds cut just right
Compliments the flow, powder stones just ain't right
Colored stones separated by blue and white
OJ da Juiceman came up off the corner right

[Verse 4: Gucci Mane]
I'm smokin' with my left to show my watch off when I'm blowing
This kush is Superfragilisticexpialidocious
50 bags I'm bringin' they would think I'm toting groceries
But they can call that I purchased just to feed the family
Baby call me back, God-damn a nigga gamblin'
Trap still jumpin' like a baby on the trampoline
Goodnight, crushed ice, sprite, and promethezine
Goodnight, crushed ice, watch, chain, pinkie rang

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & OJ da Juiceman]
Gucci: 20 bricks a night make your girl say goodnight

[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning to a perfect day
I opened my window, heard a sparrow say (twee-dee-dee-dee)
Positive thoughts are running through my mind
Nothing is wrong, feeling real strong
'Cause a new day is dawning

[Chorus]
The sun is shining, no clouds in view
Lovers are holding hands, the world's brand new
Everybody's smiling, summer's coming through
But the only thing that's missing is you
(Only thing that's missing is you)

[Verse 2]
I see your smile through your photograph
(through your photograph)
The thing that you said still makes me laugh
Deep inside, I'm on the edge of tears
But I can't be crying, sitting around sighing
Just 'cause you're not here

[Chorus]
The sun is shining, no clouds in view
Lovers are holding hands, the world's brand new
Everybody's smiling, summer's coming on through
But the only thing that's missing is you
(Only thing that's missing is you)

[Bridge]
Baby, baby, show me what do you do, when love is gone
You count your blessings and you move on (and you move on)
No, I ain't lonely, this ain't no sad song
There's just one contradiction, I can't stand to be alone

[Chorus]
The sun is shining, no clouds in view
Lovers are holding hands, the world's brand new
Everybody's smiling, summer's coming through
But the only thing that's missing is you
(Only thing that's missing is you)
The sun is shining, no clouds in view
Lovers are holding hands, the world's brand new
Everybody's smiling, summer's coming through
But the only thing that's missing is you
(Only thing that's missing is you)

[scatting]
But the only thing that's missing is you
(Only thing that's missing is you)

Tell me, are you going to watch my back?
Tell me, watch my back, watch my back, baby

[Verse 1]
Are you in love, baby?
We've been hanging, hanging, hanging for a long time now, yeah

You see, I can make it last now, yeah
Honey, you can call on me

I got your back, hey baby
(Hey, you got my back, baby)
I got your back, hey baby

[Verse 1]
Feels like I've seen you before
Maybe in a past life, you were mine and I was yours
'Cause the vibe we share feels so comfortable
Is it possible someone could make me lose control

[Chorus 1]
(Look what you've done to me)
Finding it hard to breathe
'Cause I just can't believe
You're feeling me like I'm feeling you
(I had to pinch myself) Oh
('Cause nobody else has) Yeah, yeah
Given me such a chill
And made me feel the way that you do

[Chorus 2]
I just gotta let you know
In case you didn't know
I-I-I-I-I-I think you're wonderful
There's this thing you do to me
That thing that makes me weak
Baby, I-I-I-I think you're wonderful

[Verse 3]
Questioning what this is
If it's too good to be true
I don't want to fool myself
'Cause I'm fallin' hard for you
Givin' me that old school love
Sayin' I'm the only one
Showin' me in so many ways
That you're crazy for me

[Chorus 1]
(Look what you've done to me) Oh, baby
Finding it hard to breathe
'Cause I just can't believe
You're feeling me like I'm feeling you
I had to pinch myself
'Cause nobody else has
Given me such a chill
And make me feel the way that you do, baby

[Chorus 2]
I just gotta let you know
In case you didn't know
I-I-I-I-I-I think you're wonderful
There's this thing you do to me
That thing that makes me weak
Baby, I-I-I-I think you're wonderful

[Verse 3]
I'd go anywhere
Far away from here
It would be okay
As long as you are there
You take away my pain
And I'll never be the same
You've got my heart, baby
And I just want to say, baby

[Chorus 2]
(I just gotta let you know) Sweet thing, yeah, yeah
(In case you didn't know)
(I-I-I) I-I ( I-I-I ) I-I-I (think you're wonderful)
Think you're wonderful, baby
There's this thing you do to me (This thing you do to
Me, baby)
That thing that makes me weak
Baby, I-I-I-I think you're wonderful (I-I think you're
Wonderful, yeah)

(I just gotta let you know) Ooh, baby
(In case you didn't know) In case you didn't know
(I-I-I-I-I-I think you're wonderful)
(There's this thing you do to me)
(That thing that makes me weak)
(Baby, I-I-I-I think you're wonderful)

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on
Holdin' on to something true
To what feels good to you
Gotta be strong, gotta be strong, gotta be strong
Don't let it get away from you
Do whatcha gotta do

[Verse 1: Aretha Franklin]
I know it gets hard sometimes
To find a little piece of mind
Gotta stay focused, gotta stay strong
All my people, hold on
Do what you feel inside
I know it hurts but don't cry
Life is gonna go on
With or without you, hold on

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on
Holdin' on to something true
To what feels good to you
Gotta be strong, gotta be strong, gotta be strong
Don't let it get away from you
Do whatcha gotta do

[Verse 2: Aretha Franklin]
Taking care of home and family
It's sometimes hard on your sanity
Thinking what about my fantasy
Will my dreams come true?
If I stay emotionless
Release myself from all the stress
Don't blame it all on you
To myself, I'll be true

[Bridge: Aretha Franklin]
We trade in our stability
For all types of insecurities
Now tell me what's to become of me
If I let myself stress
Every time life throws me a test

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on
Holdin' on to something true
To what feels good to you
Gotta be strong, gotta be strong, gotta be strong
Don't let it get away from you
Do whatcha gotta do
Holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on
Holdin' on to something true
To what feels good to you
Gotta be strong, gotta be strong, gotta be strong
Don't let it get away from you
Do whatcha gotta do

[Bridge: Aretha Franklin]
We trade in our stability
For all types of insecurities
Now tell me what is to become of me

Holdin' on to something true
To what feels good to you

[Interlude: Aretha Franklin + (Mary J. Blige)]
Do whatcha gotta do, yeah now
You gotta have faith in that higher power
Oh yeah, in that almighty power, Lord Jesus
(Do whatcha gotta do)

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Holdin' on, holdin' on, holdin' on
Holdin' on to something true
To what feels good to you
Gotta be strong, gotta be strong, gotta be strong
Don't let it get away from you
Do whatcha gotta do

[Intro scatting]

[Verse 1: Aretha Franklin]
It's funny how
We've wasted our time
On so-called friends
Who are really not on our side
They've always got something to say
About us and how we are spending our days
They're trying to confuse us
With their lies and deceit
But they don't really care if we
Live or died on these streets
But you and I
We both know the truth
That we will prevail
As long as God sees us through

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
No matter what they do
You need to love me
I ain't out there cheating on you
You need to trust me
Wanna see you happy, never blue
You need to love me
And just love me
And just love me
No matter what your friends are telling you
You need to love me
'Cause from me you'll always hear the truth
You need to trust me
I ain't mad at you for being you
You need to love me
'Cause I love you
So just love me

[Verse 2: Aretha Franklin]
I wish that they would leave us alone
And let us be together
Boy, you can't fall victim to those fools
Telling you whatever
You hear about me on the streets
And it'll only make you weak
And put a damper on our situation
They're trying to tear down our foundation
Sick and tired of hateration
But we gone make it as long as we stay patient

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
No matter what they do
You need to love me
I ain't out there cheating on you
You need to trust me
Wanna see you happy, never blue
You need to love me
And just love me
And just love me
No matter what your friends are telling you
You need to love me
'Cause from me you'll always hear the truth
You need to trust me
I ain't mad at you for being you
You need to love me
'Cause I love you
So just love me

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige & Aretha Franklin]
Why do we waste away our lives
Playing simple games
Telling silly lies
How far will they go 'til they realize
What goes around comes around
We got a love you can't break down

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]

[Outro scatting]

[Intro]
Ladies, ladies, and women all over the world
I know you understand where I'm coming from
Right here, right now, ri-ri-ri-ri-right now
Oh yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
We all know this girl

[Verse 1]
Here we go with the trick questions
They bring up to bring down confidence
Always throw out a sly comment
Like, is your man faithful?
What time does he get home?
Don't worry, I ain't going to need your help
I'm going to watch y'all go home by yourself
A lil' bit of my man's sweet love
Is a whole lot better than none

[Chorus]
Don't you know that everybody's somebody's fool
You watch somebody running game
But you never have a clue
Somebody's breaking every rule but it's always cool
Don't you know that everybody's somebody's fool
Hear me now

[Verse 2]
Skip the drama, use common sense
You don't have love if you don't have patience
He's out in the street, yeah, but don't forget
My twice a week and that almighty paycheck
See, I don't even sweat it, I get so much happiness
If I just put up with a lil' bit a bullshit
A lil' bit of my man's sweet love
Is a whole lot better than none

[Chorus]
Don't you know that everybody's somebody's fool
You watch somebody running game
But you never have a clue
Somebody's breaking every rule but it's always cool
Don't you know that everybody's somebody's fool
Oh yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
(Think no evil) when somebody comes home
(Hear no evil) I don't want to know
(See no evil) I just want to see love
Because somebody always takes care of everybody's wants
Don't interrogate 'bout how he spends his spare time
Whatever he chooses to do is fine, yes it is
'Cause in my heart I believe he's all mine
'Cause you think I can't see
Doesn't mean that I'm blind

[Chorus]
Don't you know that everybody's somebody's fool
You watch somebody running game
But you never have a clue
Somebody's breaking every rule but it's always cool
Everybody's somebody's fool
Don't you know that everybody's somebody's fool
You watch somebody running game
But you never have a clue
Somebody's breaking every rule but it's always cool
Everybody's somebody's fool
Everybody's somebody's fool
You watch somebody running game
But you never have a clue (smooth, ain't he?)
He's breaking every rule but it's always cool
Don't you know that everybody's somebody's fool

Listen, girl, you better learn this

[Verse]
Sugar baby, be my saviour
Cause i’m tired, i’m tired, i’ve been eight days on the road, eh (that’s right?)
That’s right, yes it is, eight days on the road
Traveling through the night
There ain’t no town, there ain’t no town
There ain’t no rest tonight, yeah (uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
I’m in and busted, standing on the county line (it does)
And that’s why, yeah, that’s why i’ve been eight days on the road, yeah (eight days on the road)
Now, that’s right, yes it is, eight days on the road (it does)
Traveling through the night
There ain’t no town, there ain’t no town
There ain’t no rest tonight (eight days on the road)
I’m here out thinking, thinking, i’m thinking about of what i’ve done (what i’ve done)
And that’s why, yeah, i’ve been eight days on the road, ah (eight days on the road)
That’s right, oooh, eight days on the road
Traveling through the night
I’m coming my home, it won’t be long
I’ll make birmingham tonight (uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
Yes i will, yes i will (uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)

[Bridge]
I’m making it back to you, baby, come on (anymore)
I’m making it back to you, baby, yeah (anymore)
I’m making it back to you, baby, no way (anymore)
I’m making it back to you, baby (anymore)

[Outro]
Oooh, eight days (eight days on the road, uuuh)
Eight days on the road, uuuh
Yeah, that’s right, yes it is (eight days on the road, uuuh)
I’ve been eight days on the road, yeah
Ooh, i’ve been sucked (sucked)
I’ve been eight days on the road, uuuh (eight days on the road, uuuh)
Oooh, yes it is, i’ve been eight days on the road (eight days on the road, uuuh)

[Chorus]
If you don’t think
You can trust anybody’s love in this world
Darling trust mine
Darling trust mine

[Verse 1]
Because it means so much to me
For you to know that i’m real
I’ll stand by your side
And our love will be our shield

[Chorus]
If you don’t think
You can trust anybody’s love in this world
Darling trust mine

[Verse 2]
I know you’ve had many disappointments
It’s in the making of the world going ’round
Happiness and heartaches share the same bed
The happy side’s where my love can be found
Oh darling, it means so much for me to find
Lord, help me find your love
And I’ll keep on trying
Under the sun that shines above

[Chorus]
If you don’t think
You can trust anybody’s love in this world
Trust mine

[Bridge]
It means so much to me
For us to find each others love
And i’ll keep on trying
Under the sun that shines above

[Chorus]
If you don’t think
You can trust anybody’s love in this world
Trust mine

[Verse 1]
I've been so many places in my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs, and I've made some bad rhyme
I've acted out my life in stages
With millions of people watching
Now we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you

[Verse 2]
I love you in a place where there's no space or time
I love you for my life, cause you're a friend of mine
And when my life is over, remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing my song for you

[Bridge]
You taught me precious secrets of the truth, withholding nothing
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now i'm so much better
Listen to the melody because my love's is in there hiding
I know your image of me is not what I hope to be
I treated you unkindly baby can't you see
There's no one more important to me
Please can't you see through me

[Outro]
Now we're alone and I'm singing the song to you
Now we're alone and I'm singing the song to you
Now we're alone and I'm singing the song to you
I'm singing to you
I'm singing to you baby
Singing to you baby, yeah
Singing the song to you

[Verse 1]
My love
Oh baby, my love
It's always been you
You make me so damn happy
I thought I knew who you were
Oh, but after twice around
I can say exactly
Of course, this is love
And I never say (and I never say)
I didn't care about you
You sweet thing (you sweet thing)
But you can't pretend the serious burn
That I feel in my heart, and there it's
A wedding ring, oh

[Chorus]
I got to get over you
Ooh, but it's so hard
'Cause you're my everything
Baby, when I think of us when
It's in the tea leaves
That we won't get our turn

[Verse 2]
You can't always have what you want
You have to take the bitter with the sweet
I'm a big girl and I know what I want
Three nights in your arms would be
A super treat
Give it to me, baby

[Chorus]
I gotta get over you
Yeah, but it's so hard
Because you're my everything
Oh, when I think of us when
I know it's in the tea leaves
That we won't get our turn

[Bridge]
Oh baby; ooh baby
Hey boy, I'm so damn happy
Ooh baby, it's always been you
Hey boy, I'm so damn happy right now, baby
Ooh, ooh baby, you
Hey boy, I'm so damn happy
Ooh, it's always been you
Hey boy, I'm so damn happy
I remember the moment
Yeah, baby; yeah, boy, mmm-hmm
Hey boy, I'm so damn happy
Ooh, it's always been you
Hey boy, I'm so damn happy
Ooh, ooh baby, you
Hey boy, I'm so damn happy
Ooh, it's always been you
Hey boy, I'm so damn happy
Ooh, ooh baby, you
Hey boy, I'm so damn happy
Ooh, it's always been you
Hey boy...

[Verse 1]
If I wanted to, I'd have anything
I could ever need, anything indeed
But if I can't have you I'd be lost within
And everything else baby
Would really not be worth anything

[Chorus]
And I've really got to tell you
Exactly how I feel
And make you understand
That love ain't playing this time
This is for real

[Verse 2]
And if I could, I'd change what I am
But without you baby, I don't give a damn
Because what I am won't change until you change it
To anything you want it to be
Oh, I'm putting my trust in you

[Chorus]
And I've really got to tell you
Exactly how I feel
And make you understand
That love ain't playing this time
This is for real

[Verse 3]
I thought it out the other day
And came to the conclusion
That I wouldn't last a minute
Without your love, baby
No, no, no, no, no, no
You really did show me, baby
When you walked out on me
Now I've got to make you understand
That I won't be bad, I won't be bad anymore

[Bridge]
Oh, honey, this is for real
Everything that I'm saying
Every word that I'm saying
Is the thought of a brand new woman
I've got to have you back
So that I can make you see
That I'm not fooling around, baby
This is a brand new me

[Outro]
And I really got to tell it
T-E-L-L-L-L-L-L-L, yeah
And make you understand
That Miss Ree ain't playing this time
Ooh, baby this is for real
Yeah, you've got to understand me
That love ain't playing this time
Really, this is for real, sure for real
You gotta understand me
This is, now, this is, hit it now
For real
I sparkle, loving the way that I do
It is true I feel so good just having you
Breathlessly and eager, submission isn't easy for me
We were so loving wasn't we?
I'd always known it could be

Don't want to do nothing, tied against your will
This ain't no cheap thrill, you got to know just how it feel
If you think you're going to fall, all you have to do is call
I have nothing in myself and I give myself to you

Say child tingle sparkle, I hope the love never breaks away
Fire burning everyday and save all the warmth for you
Just want you to know when the jealous issues
Understand there will be no other man but you baby
You can believe this love in me as I believe

And when times are low and I am really on your mind
Everybody needs some time, something funky good and kind
And you always seem to please me and you wear me down so easy
Good work is never done until the morning comes
Just want you to know when the jealous issues
Understand there will be no other man but you baby
You can believe this love in me as I believe in you

Don't want to do nothing, tied against your will
This ain't no cheap thrill, you got to know just how it feel
And if you think you're going to fall, all you have to do is call
I have nothing in myself and I give myself to you

And when times are low and I am really on your mind
Everybody needs some time, something funky good and kind

Breathlessly and eager, you got me round your finger
A sparkle with the fire, you always take me higher
You always seem to please me, you wear me down so easy
Good work is never done until the morning, the morning comes

[Verse 1]
Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing over the plain
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their sweet refrain

[Chorus]
Gloria, in excelsis Deo
Gloria, in excelsis Deo

[Verse 2]
Come to Bethlehem and see
Christ, whose birth the angels sing
Come adore on bended knee
Christ, the Lord, the newborn King

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
See Him in a manger laid
Whom the choirs of angels praise
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid
While our hearts in love we praise

[Chorus]

[Outro]
In excelsis Deo
In excelsis Deo
Merry Christmas
From the Franklin's to all of you
This is love, my darling
There's no denying
In my responses, I was lying
Wherever you were, I wanted to be with you
Lover of my life
So many times
I wanted to be there
Oh darling
Just to be where, wherever you were
I wanted to be there with you
The joining of our hearts
Joining of our hands
And with this ring I thee wed
The love of my life
I'll trust you with my heart, dear
And trust you more when you're not here

And I will be your wife
And I will love you, boy
So much more than the rest, oh yeah
I love you, boy
You are my joy
I love so much more than the rest
You are the king
You are the winner
Ooh, boy, remember that
You are my joy
I love you so much more than the rest

To let you know just where I'm coming from
Oh
But you will see that it's just a matter of time
My love will surely make you mine
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Living in a world of ghetto life
Everybody around seems so uptight
Nothing's wrong, it's alright with my man, my man

Well.  So I write this song for you
To prove that real things do come true
(Tell me what it means) Tell me, tell me what it means
I wanna know, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Living in a world of ghetto life
Everybody around here seems so uptight

[Verse 1]
It's in the way you say my name
Though I hear your voice, it's not the same
And in your eyes, I can't help but see
A much different light than there used to be

You say hello and I want to die
'Cause deep down I know that it means goodbye
I can't let go, I just keep hanging on
Though you're standing there, you're as good as gone
Though you're standing there, you're good as gone

[Chorus]
Are you falling out of love?
Baby, have you had a change of heart?
Are you falling out of love?
Tell me, is there someone new that you're dreaming of?
Are you falling out of love?

[Verse 2]
Your funny smile was all it took
And you said it all with just a look
Now I sit here, and you sit there
We just talk and talk but we get nowhere
All we do is talk and get nowhere

[Chorus]
Are you falling out of love?
Oh baby, have you had a change of heart?
Are you falling out of love?
Tell me, is there someone new that you're dreaming of?
Are you falling out of love?

Are you falling out of love?
Oh baby, have you had a change of heart?
Are you falling out of love?
Tell me, tell me, is there someone new that you're dreaming of?
Are you falling out of love?

Falling out of love

[Verse 1]
Oh baby
I feel your perfect love
Whenever my day begins
While brushing my teeth
Combing my hair
I feel you deep within
Ooh, I feel your touch, your touch
While eating my morning meal
While washing the dishes
Making up the bed
Last night was one of those things

[Chorus]
I think I'm caught in a love pang
Memories of last night
Something moves all through my body, baby
Making every little thing all right
Got good loving, such good loving
Memories of last night
Something moves all through my body, baby
Making every little thing all right
I think I'm caught in a love pang
Memories, memories of days gone by
Something moves all through my body, baby
Making every little thing all right

[Verse 2]
I feel, I feel the sun
While listening, listening to my favorite song
While I'm going to my job
Driving in my car
I wanna tell you that...

[Chorus]
I think I'm caught in a love pang
Memories of days gone by
Something moves all through my body, baby
Making every little thing all right

[Outro]
It shoots through my body
Caught in a love pang
Making every little thing all right
It shoots through my body
Caught in a love pang
Making every little thing all right
It shoots through my body
Caught in a love pang
Making every little thing all right
It shoots through my body
Caught in a love pang
Making every little thing all right

[Verse 1]
Darling, the question has been answered
And you tried hard not to say
It would have come out anyway
What did you do?
How could you have meant it, oh, when you told me
I was so deep, so deep in your heart
Now think about the times we spent apart
It wasn't true
I believed in you
Wanted to be the one at your side, oh baby
I'm not someone you can hide
Yeah

[Chorus]
A woman and a woman and a woman
Through and through
And I ain't ever loved nobody
The way I loved you

[Verse 2]
We're moving further from each other
Every day and with your every game
And it's for sure, baby, that it can't stay the same
I really deserve more
Two and two still makes four
I would have given all of my love to you
Just for the love, hey, for the love of a man
And I wasn't even—listen to this
I wasn't even in your plan
A little plan will never, never, never, never make me stay
I wanted to be the woman at your side
There's one thing I've got, baby
Baby, I've got my pride

[Chorus]
A woman and a woman and a woman
Through and through, oh yeah
But I ain't ever loved nobody
Hey, I ain't never needed a man
I ain't never loved a man the way I loved you

[Bridge]
I wish you love, I wish you well
I love you more than I can tell
This is good, boy, and I won't be bad
It's now or never, boy, and that's a fact
I'm starting over and I think of you
And remember the things we said and used to do
How could you choose to be so small
With a greater love who heard your call
I wish love, I wish you well
I loved you more than I can tell
Oh baby
I ain't ever loved nobody
I ain't never, never, never, never needed nobody
Oh yeah, I ain't ever loved nobody
The way, never loved a man the way I loved you
Ooh, oh baby, I ain't lying
I ain't ever loved a man the way I loved you
Oh sweet thing, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

[scatting]

[Outro]
You can tell everybody that I love you, yeah...
I love you with your sensitive ways
I love you, love you, love you, love you, baby
With your courageous ways, I love you, yes I do
I love you, love you, love you, love you, baby
With your strong sly sighs and your sweet lies
I love you
Anybody new in your life?
And with anybody new, really want you to love
Truly, I won't refute...
You can tell everybody...

[Verse 1]
Your tender smile gives me happy thoughts of you
You got me so close to my dreams now they have to come true
Ooh baby, nothing to be shy about
Nothing we have to lie about
Hope loving you don't confuse you
Ooh, baby baby, I don't wanna lose you
And when we touch our hearts move at a steady pace
I'm trying hard not to show the blushing over my face
Ooh yeah yeah, you bring out the woman in me
What can i see that you can't see?
I like the way we carry on
Hope you understand my feelings got me just a reeling

[Chorus]
What can I do, with this feeling?
Hooked on your love, sweet love, love
What can I do with this sweet feeling?
Hooked on your love, sweet love, love, ooh
What can I do, with this feeling?
Hooked on your love, sweet love, love

[Verse 2]
Your eyes within me, they send me just a staring me down
I'm so turned on in time and child, I got to move around
Ooh, yes I do, over and over you astound me
I take pleasure to have you around me
My loving arms would love to squeeze you
Ooh baby take it, i don't want to tease you

[Chorus]
What can i do with this feeling?
Hooked on your love sweet love love
What can I do?
What can i do, with this feeling?
Hooked on your love sweet love love

Hooked on your love, sweet love, love

[Verse 2]
Nothing to be shy about
Nothing we have to lie about
Hope loving you don't confuse you
Hope you understand these feelings me got me just a reeling

[Chorus]
What can I do with this feeling?
Hooked on your love sweet love, love
Oh what can I do with this feeling?

[Intro]
Oh, oh, woo-hoo
Oh baby, hey baby, woo-hoo, woo, baby, mhm
Doo doo doo hoo ooh
Doo doo doo hoo hoo
Doo doo hoo hoo hoo hoo
Doo doo doo hoo, yeah

[Chorus]
If you look into your heart
With a positive mind
Take some inventory
Of your woman and your glory
Leave the bad things behind

[Verse 1]
Everybody's got a story, yes they do
About love and the good things
But all the spices of your life
You have got to pay the price
If you know what I mean, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm telling everybody I know
How a girl becomes so proud
When I thought that there was nothing left
I do believe I found myself
And I wanna give it to you, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah baby

[Chorus]
So if you look into your heart
With a positive mind
Go and take some inventory
Of your woman and your glory
Leave the bad things behind

[Verse 2]
Ooh, I know my man, he really loves me
We don't have that every day
I know my man really needs me
And whatever he wanna do, I wanna do it with you, baby
Hey hey, yeah

[Bridge]
Doo doo doo hoo (Doo doo doo hoo)
Doo doo doo hoo hoo hoo
(Ah, that's it baby, that's it baby)
Doo doo doo hoo (Doo doo hoo hoo hoo hoo)
Doo doo doo goo (Doo doo hoo hoo)

[Outro]
Ah, I wouldn't lie
Love's not an easy game
And it's struggle and strain
Now that I see what he's given me
And whatever he wanna do, I wanna do it with you, baby
Hey baby, loving you more and more and more
And giving you all and all of me, yeah yeah
Mercy, baby
Loving you more, and more, and more
And giving you all and all of me, ooh baby
More, more
Mercy baby, mercy baby, mercy baby

[Verse 1]
Loving you baby
Brings a chill right down my spine, yes it does
You give me so much joy
Your love’s kinda hard to define

We've had a hard time

Oh, but somehow we got by
A winding road, a heavy load
Is nothing new, you see
We know that through the bad times
I'll have you and you'll have me

[Chorus]
United together
I finally found the one
Who'll love me forever
We two have just become as one

[Verse 2]
If we just keep this love alive
As time goes on this joy we know

Some people spend a lifetime
Looking for that special need

[Verse 1]
He came from somewhere back in her long ago
The sentimental fools don’t see trying hard
To recreate what had yet to be created once in her life
She musters a smile for his nostalgic tale
Never coming near what he wanted to say, hey, only to realize
It never really was

[Chorus]
He had a place in her life
She never made him think twice
As he rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He’s watching her go
And what a fool believes, he sees
No wise man has the power, oh yeah, to reason away, now
What seems to be
Is always better than nothing, oh yeah
Nothing at all, nothing at all

[Verse 2]
Keeps sending him somewhere back in her long ago
He can still believe there’s a place in her life
Hey, someday, somewhere, she will return

[Chorus]
He had a place in her life, oh oh
She never made him think twice
As he rises to her apology
Anybody else would surely know
He’s watching her go, oh yeah
What a fool believes, he sees
No wise man has the power, oh yeah, to reason away, yeah
And what seems to be
Is always better than nothing, oh oh oh oh oh yeah
Nothing at all, nothing at all

No wise man has the power
To reason away, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Say, can't I hear you say something
Deep inside, fall on the wall
That's where I find protection from the rain
Since you've been gone, my only friend is yesterday, ooh boy

[Chorus 1]
Telephone won't make a sound
Waiting here for you to change your mind
You never called, I'm lost in the tears I hide behind, ohh yeah

[Chorus 2]
That's where I'll be
Until you say you love me, ohh
That's where I'll be
Until you say you love me

[Verse 2]
Late at night I toss and turn
Burning memories lingering on
I'd give the world just to prove my love for you is strong
All you left is confusion and doubt
Unanswered questions, just where did I fail?
I'm hurt and helpless inside a cold and empty shell, ooh boy

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 3]
You?re love's sweet reason for living
In your arms I found my home
Love's waiting here for giving
Like a stone, like a stone, oh

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
Till you say you love me

[Verse 1]
I've seen you hanging? out
Looking? like you know what life's about
Laughing?, jiving? with your friends
Baby, that ain't where the world ends, oh yeah
I'm laying? my love on you
You'll be feeling? something? brand new, oh yes, you will
Gonna hold you tight with all my might
Squeeze you right, what you want to do tonight? Yeah
I'm going to hold you in the afternoon
Tease you from the sun
Dancing 'neath the island moon
We'll go on and on, yeah

[Chorus 1]
Ain't nobody ever loved you
Like I'm gonna love you, yeah, yeah, oh, baby, no
Ain't nobody ever loved you, boy
Like I'm gonna love you, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Hey, drag a comb across your hair
Change your shirt, we're going somewhere, ain't we, baby?
I'll throw a little lipstick on
Check the mirror twice and we're gone
I believe in rain
We can bring the heat up again, oh, yes, we can
I'm going to take my time and treat you fine
Baby, baby, baby, I'm making you mine, oh tonight, boy

[Chorus 2]
Hear the people laugh and sing
Right outside your door
Something? great is happening?
And you can be sure

[Chorus 1]

[x2]

Nobody else can love you
Like I'm gonna love you, yeah, yeah

Your touching, ohh I'm blushing
You're my water that quenches my thirst

Kissed from above

My open arms
I'm waiting here, to be held close
Let go of all of your fears

My darling, ohh darling
Honey, you are first
Your touching, ooooo I'm blushing
You're my water that quenches my thirst

A prince, and king of a man
Unopened doors
Darling, if you're mine, I am yours

[Chorus]
My darling, oooo darling
How long I've waited for you
I need your touch
Love me? How much?
Just trust me
We both knew that this would be

We're holding on
Darling, be strong
A mountain climb
Can be rocky sometime
An equal love
We hold so dear
It is real my love
Oooo I wish you were here
My darling ooo darling
You are, you are, worth waiting for
With every taste I want more
You sure make my life sweet
This is no trick

Hang all the mistletoe
I'm going to get to know you better this Christmas
And as we trim the tree

The fireside is blazing bright
We're caroling through the night
And this Christmas
Will be a, a very special Christmas for me, yeah, yeah

[Bridge: Aretha]
Alright, Eddie, my son
Sing it, Eddie

[Verse 2: Eddie Franklin]
Presents and cards are here
My world is filled with cheer and you, this Christmas
And as I look around
Your eyes outshine the town, they do, this Christmas
The fireside is blazing bright
We're caroling through the night

Eddie, you mustn't upstage your mama with those kinds of notes
Shake a hand, shake a hand, be a friend, be a friend, y'all
This Christmas

Merry Christmas
Shake your hand, shake your hand, yeah, ooh

Think about the man who ain't got no shoes, yeah, yeah

Hang on, hold on until Christmas
Higher, higher, hang on, hold on to Christmas
Hang on, hold on until Christmas
Yeah, hold on to your faith, until Christmas and after, oh, and after

Ooh, boy
Oh, yeah yeah

You walked in on the sly
Scoping for love
In the crowd I caught your eye
You can't hide your stuff

You thought I'd be naive and tame
(You met your match)
But I beat you at your own game, oh

Take another look and tell me, baby

Played by your rules

But you're bound to be my lover, oh

[Verse]
When I first met you, baby
You were only sweet sixteen
When I first met you, baby
You were only sweet sixteen
You were the sweetest thing that I'd ever seen
My brother went to Korea
My sister's down in New Orleans
My brother went to Korea baby
My sister's down in New Orleans
I wanna know baby what do you really wanna do

[Chorus]
Sweet sixteen baby, sweet sixteen
The sweetest thing I ever seen
Sweet sixteen baby, sweet sixteen
You know I'm having so much trouble, woman
The sweetest thing I ever seen
Baby I wonder
Yes I wonder
Baby I wonder
Oh, I wonder what in the world's gonna happen to me
Oh, I wonder what in the world's gonna happen to me

[Verse 1]
Do you remember me? I sat upon your knee
And I wrote to you with childhood fantasies
Well, I'm all grown up now, still need help somehow
Not for myself but for a world, a world in need

[Pre-Chorus]
No more lives torn apart
And wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts

[Chorus]
And every man would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never ever, ever end
This is my grown up Christmas list
My Christmas list

[Verse 2]
As children we believe
The grandest sight we'd see
Was something pretty
Wrapped beneath the tree
And heaven only knows
That packages and bows
Could never, ever, ever heal
A human soul

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
What is this illusion
Called the innocence of youth
Maybe in our blind belief
We can only find the truth

[Pre-Chorus]

This is my lifelong wish
This is my grown up Christmas list
My grown up Christmas list
I wish I found a

[Verse]
There's a summer place
Where it may rain or storm
Still i'm safe and warm
For within that summer place
Your arms reach out to me
And my heart is free from all care
For it knows there are no gloomy skies
When seen through the eyes
Of those that are blessed with love
And the sweet secret of a summer place
Is that it's anywhere where two people share
All of their hopes, all of their dreams
All of their lives
I don't know what to say
I love you too much to speak
Seeing you brings back
So many beautiful moments
So many beautiful memories
I need to hold you in my arms
I want to kiss your mouth
I want to love you and never stop loving you
I never want to stop loving you
There's a summer place
Where it may rain or storm
Still i'm safe, safe and warm in your arms
All our hopes and all of our dreams
All of our love
All of our dreams, all of our lives
All of our lives, all of our
All of our dreams, all of our dreams
All of our lives, all of our lives
Oh darling, i love you
Just hold me when i lie down to sleep
Darling, oh darling, oh darling
Your face comes into view just before i told you
I'm fighting hard, baby, i don't plan to come back
I'm going to win, i will be triumphant
I will be triumphant for the rest of our lives
Memories like the corners of my mind
Memories
Misty watercolor memories
Of the way we were
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another
For the way we were

Oh can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten every line
And if we had the chance to do it all again
Tell me
Would we?
Could we?

Memories may be beautiful and yet
What's too painful to remember
We simply choose to forget
So it's the laughter we'll remember
We'll remember
Whenever we remember
The way we were

[Verse]
Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round young Virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night, holy night
Son of God, love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth

Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing alleluia

And my house is not a home
Without that girl of mine

When at night I go to sleep
14 angels watch do keep
Two my head are guarding
Two my feet are guiding
Two to whom this is given
To guide my steps
To heaven
To guide me
When at dawn my eyes do wake
14 angels my peace do take
Two there are who need me
Two there are who feed me
Two who sway before me show me
All I've known
Is wrong, that I am
Not me
Two there are to take my soul
Away from here
To guide my steps

I've been wanderin' 'round in the dark
Been lost somewhere
Where no light could shine on my heart
I have known a pain so deep
But I know my faith will free me

(Get there) I'll find my way again
So don't tell me that it's over
'Cause each step just gets me closer
I will get there

I will get there somehow

Nothing's stoppin' me now
I will get through the night
And make it through to the other side
Get there (get there)
Get there (get there)

I've been in these chains for so long
I'll break free and I'll be there where I belong
Hold my head up high, I'll stand tall
And I swear this time I won't fall

[Pre-Chorus 2: Shawn]
(Get there) I will do this
(Get there) No matter what it takes
'Cause I know no limitations
And I'll reach my destination, I will get there

[Chorus: All]
(I will get there) I will get there
(I will get there somehow) somehow
(Cross that river) Cross that river
Nothing's stoppin' me now
I will get through the night
And make it through to the other side
Get there (get there)
Get there (get there)

[Bridge: Wanya]
Well, the night is cold and dark
But somewhere the sun is shining
And I'll feel it shine on me
I'll keep trying
I'll keep trying

[Chorus: All]
(Oh whoa, I will get there) I will get there
I will get there somehow (somehow)
(Cross that river) I'll cross that river for you
Nothing's stoppin' me now
I will get through the night
And make it through to the other side
Get there (get there)
Ooh, get there (get there)

[Chorus: All + Choir]
(I will get there) I will get there
(I will get there somehow) somehow
(Cross that river) I'll cross it for you
(Nothing's stoppin' me now) no matter what
(I will get through the night) I'll get through the night
And make it through to the other side
Get there (get there)
Ooh, get there (get there)
(Get there, get there)

[Outro: Wanya]
Oh I will get there

[Chorus]
Hark, the herald angels sing
Glory to a new born King
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled

[Verse 1]
Joyful, all ye nations, rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With the angelic host proclaim
Christ was born in Bethlehem

[Bridge]
Hark, the herald angels sing
Glory to a newborn King

[Verse 2]
Christ, by highest heaven adored
Christ, the ever, everlasting Lord
Late in time, behold Him come
Offspring of a Virgin's womb
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see
Hail the incarnate Deity
Pleased as man with man to dwell
Jesus, our Emmanuel

[Bridge]

[Bridge]
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Joyful, all ye nations, rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With angelic host proclaim
Christ was born in Bethlehem

[Bridge]

[Outro]
A new born King
A new born King

[Verse]
It was the night before Christmas
When all through the house
Not a body was stirring
Did I say my house?
My stockings were hung by the chimney with care
In the hopes that my new man soon will be there
And my bro and his diddy and I andy my cat
I just settled down for a long winter's nap
When out of the lawn
There rose such a clatter
I said, Mm I hardly get to see what was the matter
But to my wandering eyes
What should appear
A  silver and black Bentley
With a 

[?] man
Stepping lively and quick
I knew immediately
It was not St. Nick
And right through my front door
He was dressed in black diamond
From up to down
A bundle of gifts he had
What did I get?
As I squealed opening the package
The same old shit
I'm not ungrateful!
I shouted as he backed out of the front door
My sincerity he doubted
But I heard him exclaim
As he drove out of sight
Hey! You hell of a woman
I said, Shout it right!

[Chorus]

[x2]
I know the Lord
Will make a way
Yes, He will

[Bridge]
He'll make
A way for you
He will lead you
Safely through

[Chorus]
I know the Lord
Will make a way
Yes, He will

[Verse 1]
I have a Savior
Who I can tell
All my troubles to
When I'm burdened
And don't know
What to do
I can go to Him
In secret prayer
And I can leave
All my burdens there

[Chorus]
I know the Lord
Will make a way

[Spoken Intro]

[Verse 1]
Riding in my Thunderbird on the freeway
I turned on my radio to hear some music play
I got a silly rapper talking silly shit instead
And the only good rapper is one that's dead... on it

[Refrain]
Uh, Dead... on it
Shall we go back? (Yeah!)
Let's go

[Verse 2]
Negros from Brooklyn play the bass pretty good
But the ones from Minneapolis play it like it oughta should
A magnum fro is better when you got a poof on it
And the to and fro is funky when the grease is dead on it (Funky dead on it)

[Refrain]
Uh, dead... (On it) on it
Shall we go back? Let's go
They dead... on it, wow

[Verse 3]
See, the rapper's problem usually stem from being tone deaf
Pack the house, then try to sing, there won't be no one left (Ha ha) (On it)
Parking lot's on fire, brothers peeling out of the town
They say in disgust, they singing their guts
"Rapping done let us down" (Down down)
You got to be dead... on it

[Refrain]
Dead... on it (Dead)

[Verse 4]
All the sisters like it when you lick them on the knees
Don't believe me? (No) Do it once then stop
They'll be begging please, please, please (Please, please, please)
Shoo be doo wa, dead... on it
What does that have to do with the funk?
Nothing, but who's paying the bills?
If you don't want to lick my knees, sho', your mama will

[Refrain]
Uh, because we, because we, because we dead... on it
De, de- de- de- de- de- de, dead... on it, on it

[Chorus]
Na na na-na
Ne-na na-na ne-na na-na
Na na na-na

[Verse 5]
My bed's a coffin, Dracula ain't got shit on me
My nickname's Hell's-a-Poppin', I'm badder than the Wicked Witch-a
I got a gold tooth, cost more than your house
I got a diamond ring on four fingers, each one the size of a mouse

[Refrain]
They dead, they dead... on it, on it

[Chorus]
Na na na-na
Ne-na na-na ne-na na-na
Na na na-na

Ne-na na-na ne-na na-na

Wait now, hang up, dial tone on the three
You know, you know, I'm busy, too scizzy
Can't nobody fuck with me

[Refrain]
Because I'm dead... (On it, on it, on it)
Shoo be doo wa wa, dead on it
Dead... on it, on it, on it

Dang, dang, dang, dang, (Dead on it) shoo be dang, dang, dang, dead on it

New coat, huh?

You seeing that rich motherfucker again
You know who I'm talking about
That slicked back paddy with all the gold in his mouth
Don't try to play me for yesterday's fool
Because I'll slap your ass into the middle of next week
I'm sorry baby, that's the rules
I pay the rent in this raggedy motherfucker
And all you do is suck up food and heat
Say what? Oh yeah?
For someone who can't stand them T.V. dinners
You sure eat enough of them motherfuckers
Who bought you that diamond ring?
Yeah, right
Since when did you have a job?
You seeing that rich motherfucker again
What's his name? Bob?
Bob, ain't that a bitch?
What's he do for a living?
Manage rock stars?

Ain't that a bitch?

Please, who do I look like baby?
Yesterday's fool?
Don't you know I will kill you now?

You think I don't?
Then what's this?
Oh, you quiet now
Uh uh!
Little? Yeah, right. It might be little but it's loud

And go in there
And put on that wig I bought you
No, No

The reddish-brown one
Bob, ain't that a bitch?
Oh

[Chorus]
Hey Bob, if you're out there, let me see you dance
You said you was funky
C'mon, c'mon

Ain't that a bitch?

[Verse 2]
(Come out with your hands up)
I'll kick your ass (This is your last warning)
Think I won't? (Oh no! The nigga's got a laser)
(Let's get the hell out of here)
Is Mr. George home?
Hello, Mr. George?
This is your conscience, motherfucker
Why don't you leave motherfuckers alone?
What's wrong with you?
Well, why can't we just dance?
Why can't we just dance?
No, fuck that, fuck that
I don't talk about you, I don't talk about you
Wit' yo' little almond-shaped head ass
Who the fuck do you think this is?
I'll kick your ass... twice

[Chorus]
Bob, if you're out there
Let me see you dance
You said you were funky, c'mon

[Bridge]
B-O-B, spell the shit backwards, what'd it say
Same motherfucking shit
Turn it out

[Outro]
Bob, ain't that a bitch?

[Intro]
Ha, ha, ha, ha ha

[Verse 1]
If your body needs water
Keep on dancing 'cause you oughta
Keep the blood flowin' down to your feet
Brother Maurice will be 'round in a minute
With a bucket, filled in it, squirrel meat
The blood real good if you drink it real fast
But, the aftertaste just lasts and lasts
So, if you kiss somebody, you'll wanna party all night
All right!

[Chorus]
Superfunkycalifragisexy
Superfunkycalifragisexy

[Verse 2]
If you do too much, your skin will be sensitive to touch
The first person that touch you, you'll wanna fuck
You take 'em to your crib, and you tie them to a chair
And you make funny faces 'til they get really scared
Then you turn on the neon, then you play with yourself
'Til you turn them on

[Refrain]
This beat is on time, refined and designed
To make you do the do

[Chorus]
Superfunkycalifragisexy
Superfunkycalifragisexy

[Verse 3]
This chair goes round and round, I feel like a clown
'Cause I'm stripped down, It's all fun and games
'Til the very next day
'Til, damn, you don't remember my name
Maybe I'll see you next Thursday night, maybe I won't
But that's alright
'Cause in my possession is a signed confession
That says, I was the best you'd ever had
Too bad

[Refrain]
This beat is on time, refined and designed
To make you do the do

[Chorus]
Superfunkycalifragisexy

If your body needs water
Keep dancin' 'cause you oughta
Keep the blood flowing down to your feet
Brother Maurice will be 'round in a minute
With a bucket, filled in it, squirrel meat
If you can't beat them, (If you can't beat 'em)

This is precisely what I intend to do, honey
Honey, do you know I let Robert cut my hair this morning?
(Honey, look at this one here) (I'm looking Joe trying to see)
Oh girl, where'd you get those shoes?
You know he had me looking so bad (Honey, she's so free)

Maurice thinks: (Mm, I think that's right, honey)
Go on up to her, say something

Uh! Don't try it!
Cat, what's happening babe? (Bitch, would you play something?)
Get out of my face! (Honey, it's not that type of party)

Honey, you see these pumps? (Bitch!)

[Verse 1]
Does anybody know you're here?
This house of ill-repute (Ooohh honey I'm scared of you)
Trying to deal with all your fears
I guess this is what you get for being cute (Cute, cute)
Soaked in banana cologne
No wonder you're all alone
It's written all over your face
You're just-a rock hard in a funky place

[Chorus]
Rock hard in a funky place

[Verse 2]
Here comes a lady so you cover up
She's a freaked out
Funky electric mama with double cups
You couldn’
