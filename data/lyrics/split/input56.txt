ries
Turn around, move it for me (Yeah!)
Bend it over, end of story

[Break: Dr. Dre & Anderson .Paak]
Seems like chasing paper's what's important to you
Got a relationship with that money
But that bitch will never be faithful to you
Even though I know she know she crazy
Please just let it go, seize, no saving you
Ride, ride 'til the motherfuckin' wheels fall off in this bitch
But we can do it for the love
But I'm never stopping my poppin'
These numbers don't lie, but your love is superficial
It's the simple shit you need to pay attention to

[Chorus: Jill Scott]
Want that, need that
Root of all evil, mane, oh (Get it, get, I said)
I want that, need that
Root of all evil, mane, oh

[Bridge: Jill Scott]
It's beautiful outside
Looks like it's raining money, mane
It's beautiful outside
Looks like it's raining money, mane

[Outro: Jill Scott]
Want that, need that
Root of all evil, mane, oh (Get it, get, I said)
I want that, need that
Root of all evil, mane

[Refrain: Anderson Paak]
These old sneakers, faded blue jeans, no tricks, no gimmicks
I be stompin' down-down-down-down-down demons
Rollin' up trees in the belly of the beast
Where the people disagree
The upper class eat, middle don't exist
The bottom of the beat, glad I got my sticks
Are you jumpin' on a fad, layin' in a ditch?
I be stompin' down demons, stompin' down quick, come on

[Chorus: Anderson Paak]
And please don't come around these parts
And tell me that we all a bunch of animals
The only time they wanna turn the cameras on
Is when we're fuckin' shit up, come on

[Verse 1: Anderson Paak]
Bullets still ringin', blood on the cement
Black folks grievin', headlines readin'
Tryna pay it no mind, you just livin' your life
Everyone is a witness, everyone got opinions
Got a son of my own, look him right in his eyes
I ain't livin' in fear, but I'm holdin' him tight
Got a son of my own, look him right in his eyes
I ain't livin' in fear, but I'm holdin' him tight

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Damn, why the fuck are they after me? Maybe 'cause I'm a bastard?
Or maybe 'cause of the way my hair grow naturally?
Still tryna figure out why the fuck I'm full of rage
I think I noticed this bullshit right around the fifth grade
Paraphernalia in my locker right next to the switchblade
Nothin' but pussy on my mind and some plans of gettin' paid
But I'm a product of the system, raised on government aid
And I knew just how to react when it was time for that raid
Just a young black man from Compton, wonderin', 'who could save us?'
And could barely read the sentences the justice system gave us
So many rental cars with bricks, I think they probably funded Avis
Some of us was imbalanced but some us used our talents, shit
Not all of us criminals but cops be yellin', "Stay back, nigga!"
We need a little bit of payback (Payback!)
Don't treat me like an animal 'cause all this shit is flammable
Don't fuck around 'cause when it's done, it's done
Fuck you!

[Pre-Chorus: Anderson Paak]
And the old folks tell me it's been goin' on since back in the day
But that don't make it okay
And them white folks tell me all the lootin' and the shootin's insane
But you don't know our pain

[Chorus: Anderson Paak]
And please don't come around these parts
And tell me that we all a bunch of animals
The only time they wanna turn the cameras on
Is when we fuckin' shit up, come on
And please don't come around these parts
And tell me that we're all a bunch of animals
The only time they wanna turn the cameras on
Is when we're fuckin' shit up, come on

[Refrain: Anderson Paak]
These old sneakers, faded blue jeans, no tricks, no gimmicks
I be stomping down-down-down-down-down demons
Rollin' up trees in the belly of the beast

[Outro: DJ Premier, Dr. Dre, & Samples]
Yeah! This is DJ motherfuckin' Premier!
And I'm Dr. Dre (Dr. Dre)
What, Premo! Yeah, we fuckin' shit up!
No! We don't play no games here! Motherfucker, please!
Aftermath
One of the reasons that me and you click
We don't lose, I always win
Let's face it, you basic, boy, for realla, for realla
Professional winners!
For realla, for realla

[Intro]
I just need y'all to try to bear with me for a minute
While I talk about the pages of my diary, listen up

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I remember when I got started my intention was to win
But a lot of shit changed since then
Some old friends became enemies in the quest of victory
But I made a vow, never let this shit get to me
I let it pass, so I consider that part of my history
And I'm strong; financially, physically
Mentally I'm on a whole 'nother level
And don't forget that I came from the ghetto
Sold a new house for my moms, that's special
I let you going shopping 'til your feet get tired
Then a new Benz just for you to ride in
When I didn't have it, you provided
Don't be surprised that I built an enterprise
And my house got a view of the city like a highrise
I'm just talking to my diary
I'm just talking to my diary

[Hook]
When I open up my book, I think about the world later
No ink in the pen, no lines on the paper
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary
Sometimes when I got a lot of shit on my mind
I'm just staring at the sky, you probably thinkin' I'm high
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary

[Bridge]
Now puff-puff-pass got a nigga having flashbacks
I remember how it used to be
Now my money like NASDAQ, my checks you can cash that
I remember how it used to be

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
I used to be a starving artist, so I would never starve an artist
This is my passion, it's where my heart is
It gets the hardest when I think about the dearly departed
Like the nigga I started with
I know Eazy can see me now, looking down through the clouds
And regardless, I know my nigga still proud
It's been a while since we spoke but you still my folks
We used to sit back, laugh and joke
Now I remember when we used to do all-nighters
You in the booth and Cube in the corner writing
Where Ren at? Shout out to my nigga Yella
Damn, I miss that... shit, a nigga having flashbacks

[Hook]
When I open up my book I think about the world later
No ink in the pen, no lines on the paper
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary
Sometimes when I got a lot of shit on my mind
I'm just staring at the sky, you probably thinkin' I'm high
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary

[Outro: Trumpet]

[Chorus]
Won't you keep in touch with me?
Don't lose it, don't lose it
Won't you stop beatin' up on me?
Ayy, don't abuse it, don't abuse it
Won't you fall in love with me?
I say, stop losing, stop losing
You gon' end up winning with me
Ayy, don't lose it, don't lose it

[Verse 1]
Ayy, I'ma ride it like a Kawaski bike
When you feel down, I'ma be the one that make you feel right
If he gon' have you riding, I'ma be that one that make you catch flights
I'ma flood you in the black diamonds, they gon' think you a knight
Ayy, I got them dark blue true's with the buttons like pendants
Walkin' down Rodeo, your real hair like Indian remy
Mix match bottoms, pockets fat but the true's will fit it
'Cause I got pounds of the kush, and I sold tons of the midget
And everytime I think about you, I, I want sex baby
Dancing down the pole, you the best baby
I know you kinda busy but I want next baby
I-I want next baby, have my next baby, yeah
Fuck what they saying about me and you
'Cause I'm on garden food, and you on garden food
And I done did so much wrong in these streets
God gave me back, 'cause I'm miss you and you ain't missing me
But try to just

[Chorus]
Keep in touch with me
Don't lose it, don't lose it
Won't you stop beatin' up on me?
Ayy, don't abuse it, don't abuse it
Won't you fall in love with me?
I say, stop losing, stop losing
You gon' end up winning with me
Ayy, don't lose it, don't lose it

[Verse 2]
Ayy, I'ma fuck you like I never did tonight
Choppas everywhere, you have no reason to fright
If I try to talk to you, you were mad we had skype
You gon' get the text I sent said "everything gon' be alright"
Ayy, I'ma come to you right home when I get back
Girl, you know your loving got Young Thugga like crack
Girl, you know you kill me when you act like a brat
You said the only noise you wanna hear when they rub is br-aaaat
Ayy, and I'ma treat it like it's never ever been treated
I say I'ma beat it like it's never ever been beated
I say I'ma feature like it's never been featured
And I'ma eat it like it's never been eaten, yeah
Ayy, and I'ma come back for it
Oh, that roadblock? I'ma ride past for it
Oh, I will bust my ass for it
I ran my money up, now I can afford
But you should

[Chorus]
Keep in touch with me
Don't lose it, don't lose it
Won't you stop beatin' up on me?
Ayy, don't abuse it, don't abuse it
Won't you fall in love with me?
I say, stop losing, stop losing
You gon' end up winning with me
Ayy, don't lose it, don't lose it

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I say, gettin to the money that's all we know
Middle of the drought tryin to move that snow
Get that flip that stack that dough
Side hit that bitch and smack that hoe
Toolie on deck everywhere we go
Fucking every bitch on 

[?]
I spit that shit got a dappy flow
I fly by hoes like there he go
Ya we trap like its a sport
Ya I shine like armor all, but yet I ball like on the court
Ally-oop a little bitch Omelly slam her for the score
Ya its my time and I'ma shine like I'm a fucking Audemar
Stunt, ball, like its no tomorrow
Fuck your main bitch and probably won't return her call (not at all)
Sucking her and cuffing her like she broke the law
While I'm whipping all these hoe like I'm trying to turn a car
Back to the flow I was killing that shit
Been about a week you still on that brick
North side nigga I'm still on that shit
We all fucking her you feeling that bitch
You still on that bitch
Running through hoes like Reggie bush
We blow that purple jelly baby I don't know how Reggie look

[Interlude: Omelly]
Damn, its all types of charge
On some 

[?] county type shit
Like if my PO find out that 

[?] I might go to jail for that shit
Fucking with these bitches man

[Verse 2: Oschino]
Looney Tune, Goony Goon, stepping in my Louie shoes
Your bitch she on dick, give me inside my movie room
Paper paper on my mind, in my coup as I recline
Coming through the block to cop, got it hot as Palestine
Money money half a mil, chase it down like track and field
Me and money Jack and Jill, we together all the time
Up the hill, down the block we got rocks like empty lot
Black and gold Jaguar that shit look like a copper top
Duracell, corner sale, killing shit like 

[?]
Ya the 

[?] threw the pussy like the shit your daughter sell
Oschi, Oski, Gold Rollie low key
I ain't got a grind I spend the shit I made in '03
Whole key, half a  

[?], feeling like a hammer song
Too legit to quit can't touch this hammer law
Get it in, flip it fast, I be getting killer grabs
Niggas want to see me fall, bike no kick stand
Pocket change, diamond ring, shit look like a hockey rink
Llama sing, loud song, hit that nigga ground ball
Standing tall as John wall
Never snitch, never rat

[?] get right back even if I got to max
Gettin money what I do, VIP let me through
Omelly whole crew gettin' change phone booth, phone booth

[Verse]
I talk shit like Mayweather cause I know I'm way better
I'm a beast like Della Reese
I'm on a grind all the time I ain't never sleep
I eat Jay-Z  for breakfast Weezy for dinner
I ain't dissing not at all I'm just a starving little nigga
Tryna eat like a hungry Ethiopian
Nigga we be trappin' we got keys like a custodian
Long ass clips with 33s like Nickelodeon
Notice 'em, I put you on the wing like you deodorant
Going in, every verse shittin' on 'em
Hard body 

[?]
TIP be calling play I run that shit like I'm Clinton Portis
Touchdown on these haters like what now
Aaron Jones to all you rappers we open you shutdown
Its like every time I'm round them shooters be on deck and they ready to gun down
My pockets say ching ching
My neck it say bling bling
Puffin on that Cali bud the same color as string bean
I be up in Hollywood wonder why you ain't seen me
I was in the 57 macking like a 11
High like I'm in heaven can't nobody do it better
Got the multi-colored diamonds looking like a Coogi sweater
See them jack boys looking like they want to jump then let 'em
I ain't never been no pussy bring them choppers to whoever
Drama I'm a problem you ain't tell 'em
I be shitting on these rappers I'm surprised that you ain't smell 'em or inhale them
Spit fire breath ether, creeping through the hood my hoodie on like the reaper
Four pound on me big boy dumb speakers
APC put you on air like you ACG
I probably Nike check a nigga tryna to play with
Matter fact I check a nigga like he ADB

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Only losers go to school
I taught myself how to move
I'm not the type to count on you, uh
'Cause stupid's next to "I love you"

[Hook: The Weeknd]
No? So what can you show me
That my heart don't know already?
We make our own sense
And you're qualified to me
What can you show me
That my heart don't know already?
We make our own sense
And you're qualified to...
And you're qualified to...

[Verse 2: Labrinth]
Only losers go to school

'Cause stupid's next to "I love you"

[Hook 2: Labrinth]
So what can you show me

'Cause we make our own sense
You're qualified to me

[Bridge: The Weeknd]
And now that we're all grown up
Who do we owe it to?
And now that we've gone this far
Who do we owe it all to?
We did it all alone
Now we're coming for the throne
We did it all alone
Now we're coming for the throne
And now that we all came up
Do we lose? Do we lose?

[Hook: The Weeknd]
So what can you show me
That my heart don't know already?
'Cause we make our own sense
And you're qualified to me
What can you show me
That my heart don't know already?
'Cause we make our own sense

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
Waking up, half-past five
Blood on pillow and one bruised eye
Drunk too much, you know what I'm like
But you shoulda seen the other guy

[Pre-Chorus 1: Ed Sheeran]
This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me
Well, baby, I'm just being honest
And I know my lies could not make you believe
We're running in circles, that's why

[Chorus 1: Ed Sheeran]
In my dark times, I'll be going back to the street
Promising everything I do not mean
In my dark time, baby, this is all I could be
And only my mother can love me for me
In my dark time
In my dark time

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
Light one up, let me bum a smoke, uh
Still coming down, dripping throat, uh
I got another man's blood on my clothes
But it ain't his fault, it's the life I chose

[Pre-Chorus 2: The Weeknd]
This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me
My baby, I'm just being honest, uh
And I know my lies could never make you believe
Running in circles, that's why

[Chorus 2: The Weeknd]
In my dark times, I'll be going back to these streets
Promising everything I do not mean
In my dark times, maybe this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark times
In my dark times

[Bridge: Ed Sheeran & The Weeknd]
In my dark times, I've still got some problems, I know
Drivin' too fast but just movin' too slow
And I've got something I've been trying to let go of
Pullin' me back every time

[Chorus 3: Ed Sheeran & The Weeknd]
In my dark times, taking it back to the street
Making those promises that I could not keep
In my dark times, baby, this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark time, taking it down to the street
Making those promises that I would never keep
In my dark time, this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark times
In my dark time
In my dark times

[Verse 1]
Tell 'em this boy wasn't meant for lovin', uh
Tell 'em this heart doesn't stay to one
I'll be the same, never changed for nothin', uh
It's all I know, never learned much more

[Pre-Chorus]
Mama called me destructive, oh, yeah
Said it'd ruin me one day, yeah
'Cause every woman that loved me, oh, yeah
I seemed to push them away

[Chorus]
That's real life, oh, oh-oh
Real life, ooh
Mama talking that real life, oh, oh-oh
That real life, real life, real life, real life

[Verse 2]
I know you don't really understand it, uh
I'm not allowed to regret my choice, mmm
I heard that love is a risk worth taking, uh
I wouldn't know, never been that boy

[Pre-Chorus]
Mama called me destructive, oh, yeah
Said it'd ruin me one day, yeah
'Cause every woman that loved me, oh, yeah
I seemed to push them away

[Chorus]
That's real life, oh, oh-oh
Real life, ooh
Mama talking that real life, oh, oh-oh
That real life, real life, real life, real life

[Bridge]
Heaven only lets a few in
(Heaven only lets a few in)
It's too late for me to choose it
(It's too late for me to choose it)
Don't waste precious tears on me, I'm not worth the misery
I'm better off when I'm alone

[Chorus]
And that's real life, oh, oh-oh
Real life, ooh
Mama talking that real life, oh, oh-oh
That real life, real life, real life, real life
That's real life, oh, oh-oh
Real life, ooh
Mama talking that real life, oh, oh-oh (Ooh, mama!)
Yeah, yeah, real life, real life, real life, real life

[Verse 1]
It's just me and you
They couldn't see what I see in you, yeah
'Cause I believe in you, uh
You're the only one I choose

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Even though you break my heart
Even though you break my heart, baby
I know what we are, our love's too young
Even though you break my heart, my love
I'ma need you, I'ma need you, I'ma need you, yeah

[Chorus]

Ooh, yeah
Just a phase in our little lie, ch-yeah
We can sex all night, uh
Ooh, woah

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But you know I'll break your heart, your heart
Cause I know what we are, our love's too young
Even though I'll break your heart, your heart

[Verse 1]
We are not the same, I am too reckless
I'm not tryna go in that direction
These niggas, they been doin' too much flexin'
And they about to call the wrong attention
And I don't got no patience, no more testin'
I do shit how I want, don't need no blessin'
XO niggas ain't nothin' to mess with
Nobody stoppin' us, oh, no, we destined
And everybody 'round you is so basic
I'm never rockin' white, I'm like a racist
I don't drink my liquor wit' a chase in
That money is the only thing I'm chasin'
And some dope dimes on some coke lines
Gimme head all night, cum four times
Baby girl just wanna smoke a pound
Do an ounce, get some dick, tell her friends about it

[Chorus]
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I get it on the low
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill

[Verse 2]
Last year I did all the politickin'
This year I'ma focus on the vision (The vision)
I think these hoes deserve another fixin' (Fixin')
I'm talkin' 'bout the ones from the beginnin' (Oh, oh, oh)
Don't believe the rumors, bitch, I'm still a user
I'm still rockin' camo and still roll with shooters
I'm a villain in my city, I just made another killin'
I'ma spend it all on bitches (On bitches)
And everybody fuckin', everybody fuckin'
Pussy on the house, everybody fuckin'
Man, I miss my city, man, it's been a minute (Been a minute)
MIA a habit, Cali was the mission
Cruise through the west-end in my new Benz (Ooh, woah)
I'm just tryna live life through a new lens
Drivin' by the streets I used to walk through
When I had no crib, I guess you call that shit a miracle

[Chorus]
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I get it on the low
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill

[Bridge: Kanye West]
Roll some, think I’ll roll some
To know some, if we both honest
Who lasts? Yeah, you lie
Spent the whole summer
Tryna be at the wrong place at the right time
But I know what's mine when I see it
I know

[Bridge]
My cousin said I made it big and it's unusual
She tried to take a selfie at my Grandma's funeral
Used to roam on Queen, now I sing Queen Street anthems
Used to hate attention, now I pull up in that wagon
And I was broken, I was broken, I was so broke
I used to roam around the town when I was homeless
Me and Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans
And flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix
Now we get faded when we want, girl, we got choices
Lay them on the fuckin' table, we got choices
And if they wanna fuck my niggas, they got choices
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless

[Chorus]
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I get it on the low
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill

[Verse 1]
Baby, you're no good
'Cause they warned me 'bout your type, girl, I've been ducking left and right
Baby, you're no good
Think I fell for you, I fell for you, I fell for you

[Pre-Chorus]
You got me puttin' time in, time in
Nobody got me feelin' this way
You probably think I'm lyin', lyin'
I'm used to bitches comin' right 'way

[Chorus]
You got me touchin' on your body
You got me touchin' on your body
To say that we're in love is dangerous
But girl, I'm so glad we're acquainted, oh
I'll get you touchin' on your body
I'll get you touchin' on your body
I know I'd rather be complacent
But girl, I'm so glad we're acquainted
We're acquainted

[Verse 2]
Baby, you're no good
All my niggas think I'm crazy 'cause I'm thinkin' 'bout us lately
But really if I could
I'd forget about you, 'get about you, 'get about you

[Pre-Chorus]
You got me puttin' time in, time in
Nobody got me feelin' this way
You probably think I'm lyin', lyin'
I'm used to bitches comin' right 'way

[Chorus]
You got me touchin' on your body
You got me touchin' on your body
To say that we're in love is dangerous
But girl, I'm so glad we're acquainted, oh
I got you touchin' on your body
I got you touchin' on your body
I know I'd rather be complacent
But girl, I'm so glad we're acquainted
We're acquainted

[Verse 3]
Momma called me cryin', cryin', cryin', cryin'
'Cause I won't find somebody that's real (She wants somebody that's real), yeah
'Cause every time I try to, try to, try to run
The fast life keeps gaining on me (The fast life keeps gaining on me), sh-yeah
But ever since I met you (Ever since I met you)
I couldn't believe what you did
So comfort me, babe, ain't no rush from me, babe
(Woooooh)

[Chorus]
I'll keep on touchin' on your body
I'll keep on touchin' on your body
To say that we're in love is dangerous
But girl, I'm so glad we're acquainted, oh
I got you touchin' on your body (Touchin' on your body)
I got you touchin' on your body (Touchin' on your body)
I know I'd rather be complacent
But girl, I'm so glad we're acquainted
We're acquainted

[Outro]
I'm not tryna talk at all
'Cause I'm tryna love you crazy
Put some more inside your cup
And drink 'til you numb the pain
I got you touchin' on your body
These girls keep touchin' on they body
They got accustomed to the life we live
These girls born in the '90s are dangerous
I got 'em thinkin' that they want me
Although, they know they not the only
I got 'em wanting to embrace their sins
These girls born in the '90s are dangerous

[Meek Mill]
I been, I been looking on the motherfuckin’ internet
And I been seeing a lot of niggas on Gram with fake busted ass things
If you from Philly
And you rep for Meek Milly, make some fuckin’ noise
You don’t wanna see my Philly niggas hanging out the window
Like we’re tryna spot Ricky
And shout out to the niggas that showed me they not with me
Shit, I don’t think it’s bout no rapping, it’s about Nicki
He told us he was first in line but it got tricky
I still wake up with the lady that you said you first in line with
Did five months, came home, that’s perfect timing
To make a sucka nigga look sucka without trying
If Quentin Miller wrote that shit, why were we buying?
Might as well go and get his tape, is he good or is he great?
Niggas turn to hoes, Caitlyn Jenners turn to Drizzy Drakes
Woah shit, we in Philly right?
See I represent the niggas that come from the bottom
If you started from nothing, make some fuckin' noise in this bitch
I said when I first seen my homie sitting in the casket
Is when I first went to get the ratchet
Shit is real, the fuckin' crackers itching to do me like Emmett Till
And I can smell death in the air and you the kill
When you was still out in the field toting them Glocks
Man, he was still with wheelchair Jimmy rolling them blocks
My momma used to hold them Berettas when it was hot
Your momma used to peek out the window and call the cops
And the nerve of y’all niggas, saying y'all started from the bottom
When the real niggas dying, cops killing, metal flying
All that bullshit you selling, real niggas never buy
Uh, I got word from the six, niggas say you testified
When they ran up on you…
Fuck knows how many I got
Let's turn up, we in fuckin' Philly, let's get it
The sound that you're listenin' to
Is from my guitar that's named Lucille
I'm very crazy about Lucille
Lucille took me from the plantation
Or you might say brought me fame

I don't think I can just talk enough about Lucille
Sometimes when I'm blue it's seems like Lucille
Tryin' to help me callin' my name

I used to sing spirituals and I thought that
This was the thing I wanted to do
But somehow or another, when I went in the Army
I picked up on Lucille, started singin' blues

Well, now when I'm payin' my dues
Maybe you don't know what I mean when I say payin' my dues
I mean when things are bad with me
I can always, I can always you, you know, like depend on Lucille

Sorta hard to talk to you myself
I guess, I'll let Lucille say
All of a few words and then
You know, I doubt if you can feel it like I do
But when I think about the things that I've gone through
Like, well, for instance, if I have a girlfriend and she's misusin' me
And I go home at night, maybe I'm lonely
Well, not maybe, I am lonely

I pick up Lucille and then ping out those funny sounds
That sound good to me, you know
Sometimes I get to play it where I can't even say nothin'
Look out
Sometimes I think it is cryin'

You know if I can sing pop tunes like
Frank Sinatra or Sammy Davis Jr
I don't think I still could do it
'Cause Lucille don't wanna play nothin' but the blues
And I think I'm, I think I'm pretty glad about that
'Cause don't nobody sing to me like Lucille, sing Lucille

Well, I'll put it like this, take it easy, Lucille
I like the way Sammy sings and I like the way Frank sings
But I can get a little Frank, Sammy, little Ray Charles
In fact all the people with soul in this

A little Mahalia Jackson in there
One more Lucille, take it easy now
You know, I've met a lot of you months ago
A lot of you wanna know why I call the guitar, Lucille
Lucille has practically saved my life two, three times
No kidding, really has

I remember once I was in an automobile accident
And when the car stopped turnin' over, it fell over on Lucille
And it held it up off of me, really, it held it up off of me
So that's one time it saved my life

The way, the way, I, uh, I came by the name of Lucille
I was over in Twist, Arkansas, I know you never heard of that
But happened and one night, the guys started a ball over there
You know started brawlin', you know what I mean

And the guy that was mad with this old lady
When she fell over on this gas tank that was burnin' for heat
The gas ran all over the floor and when the gas ran all over the floor
The building caught on fire and almost burned me up
Tryin' to save Lucille

Uh, oh, I, I imagine you're still wondering why I call it Lucille
The lady that started the brawl that night was named Lucille
And that's been Lucille ever since to me

One more now, Lucille
Sounds pretty good to me, can I do one more?
Look out, Lucille
Sounds really good, I think I'll try one more, alright

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Everything you do, smoke weed

[Chorus]
Time flies, no lie (no lie)
I'd rather be getting high (high)
Ridin' with my niggas getting right (right)
It ain't over 'till I say so (say so)
Time flies, no lie (no lie)
I'd rather be getting high (high)
Ridin' with my niggas getting right (right)
It ain't over 'till I say so (say so)

[Verse]
Hold up, roll up, mo money to throw up
Walk in the club, everybody go up
A hundred and 50K just to show up
And everything ain't what it seems
It's hard to live somebody else's dreams
I put all my trust in my team
Know that my money straight, won't let nothing come in between
Politic with my fam, never let the hate intervene
Smoking weed out of Vegas and thanking God for the scene
Thinking back to when we ain't have it
Made it on, came far, needed practice
Moving forward while you thinking backwards
Never sleep, hardly need a mattress
I kick my shoes off my feet, then fall asleep in my seat
Claiming you on your job, well doggie, it ain't complete
Claiming you got the squad but you niggas can't compete
Came with too many broads, can't fit them all in my suite
What can I say? Bring the champagne glasses, roll the J's faster

[Chorus]
Time flies, no lie (no lie)
I'd rather be getting high (high)
Ridin' with my niggas getting right (right)
It ain't over 'till I say so (say so)
Time flies, no lie (no lie)
I'd rather be getting high (high)
Ridin' with my niggas getting right (right)
It ain't over 'till I say so (say so)

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
They say boys don't cry
But your dad has shed a lot of tears
They say I should be a strong man
But baby, I'm still filled with fear
Sometimes I don't know who I am
Sometimes I question why I'm here
I just wanna be a good dad
Will I be? I have no idea
They say girls shouldn't be tough
And moms should raise their kids at home
But baby, I know that that isn't true
Cause your momma's the toughest person I know
I wanna raise you to be like her
And watch you show the world how to do it on your own
I'm still tryna figure out who I am
I don't wanna mess this up or do this wrong
I'm gonna be there for your first breath
I don't know if I'll be there for your first step
I can promise you that I'll try to work less
But the tour's routed, and I got this album
Put in so many hours, and I just want the outcome
To be something that I can look back and I can be proud of
Don't wanna be a dad that's living in FaceTime
But I got a world to sing to and you at the same time
I won't spoil you, you can trust that
For your sweet sixteen, you get a bus pass
Had your heart broken? Been there, done that
I love you and I can't give you enough of that
Give back to community that raised you up
Read Langston Hughes, I suggest "A Raisin in the Sun"
Listen to Sam Cooke, a change gon' come
You put the work in, don't worry about the praise, my love
Don't try to change the world, find something that you love
And do it every day
Do that for the rest of your life
And eventually, the world will change

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
I'll be patient, one more month
You'll wrap your fingers round my thumb
Times are changing, I know
But who am I if I'm the person you become
If I'm still growing up, up, up, up
I'm still growing up, up, up, up
I'm still growing up

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
I recommend that you read "The Alchemist"
Listen to your teachers, but cheat in calculus
Tell the truth, regardless of the consequence
And every day, give your momma a compliment
Take your girl to the prom
But don't get too drunk hanging out the limo
Slow dance with your woman in your arms
Sneak her in after but boy, you better tiptoe
Don't wake your mom up
Do yoga, learn 'bout karma
Find God, but leave the dogma
The quickest way to happiness? Learning to be selfless
Ask more questions, talk about yourself less
Study David Bowie, James Baldwin and 2Pac
Watch the sun set with best friends from a rooftop
Wear a helmet, don't be stupid
Jaywalk, but look before you do it
If it snows, go outside, build a jump, get some help
Get a sled, thrash the hill with your friends, 'til it melts
Go to festivals, camp, fall in love and dance
You're only young once, my loved one, this is your chance
Take risks, cause life moves so fast
You're only young once, my loved one, this is your chance

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
I'll be patient, one more month
You'll wrap your fingers round my thumb
Times are changing, I know, but who am I if
I'm the person you become
If I'm still growing up, up, up, up
I'm still growing up, up, up, up

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
I'll be patient, one more month
You'll wrap your fingers round my thumb
Times are changing, I know
But who am I if I'm the person you become
If I'm still growing up, still growing up, still growing up
If I'm still growing up, still growing up, still growing up

[Outro: Ed Sheeran]
I'm still growing up
I'm still growing up, ooh
I'm still growing up
I'm still growing up

[Hook]
Gold lime gonna tell me where the light is
Gold lime gonna tell me where the light is
Take our hands out of control
Take our hands out of control

[Verse 1]
Now tell me what you saw
Tell me what you saw
There was a crowd of seeds
Inside, outside
I must have done a dozen each
It was the height I grew
The weight, the shell was crushing you
I've been around a few
Now tell me what you saw
I'll tell you what to

[Hook]

[Verse 1]

[Produced by Ali Payami and Max Martin]

[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Yeah
Hey Robin!

[Verse 1: Robin Thicke]
Didn't I rock with you all night?
Wasn't it good enough? Don't lie
Didn't you tell me that I blew your mind?
Brought out the animal in me
Nobody else can tame that beast
Why did you have to go and say goodbye?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now all I wanna do is get, get you back (get, get)
Cause girl, you're still the best that I've ever had
A one, two, three, let's go

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
You used your love to tear me apart
Now fuck me back together  (now fuck me back together)
You put a bullet into my heart
Now fuck me back together
Come on, I'm an addict
Come on, gotta have it
Come on, let me at it tonight
You used your love to tear me apart
Now fuck me back together

[Verse 2: Robin Thicke]
I wanna live between your legs
Hear all the freaky things you said
I don't like what you're turning me into, into
Baby, you left me on the floor
Now I keep driving past your door
I don't know why you gotta be so cruel (I don’t know why)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Now all I wanna do is get, get you back
(Wanna get you back, yeah, yeah, baby, get you back)
Cause girl you're still the best that I've ever had
A one, two, three, let's go

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
You used your love to tear me apart (you used your love)
Now fuck me back together  (now fuck me back together)
You put a bullet into my heart (straight into my heart)
Now fuck me back together
Come on, I'm an addict
Come on, gotta have it
Come on, let me at it tonight
You used your love to tear me apart (you used your love)
Now fuck me back together (together, baby)

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj (Robin Thicke)]
Yo!
Ayo, Robin
I get more head than when they noddin’
Kitty on fleek, it’s poppin', I’m Mary Poppins
Just for the record, that hard is what I’m copping
Blasting Tupac in some fishnet stockings
You know you miss this ride
M-I-S-S, missed the spot
Used to call me Hillary cause I ride ‘em (Rodham)
I said, “ring, ring, ring, ring, ra-ring, ring
Put a ring on it or ding, da-ding, ding”
Boy your times up, where’d you wind up?
There’s levels to this (uhh!), you shoulda climbed up
(Let's go)

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
You used your love to tear me apart
Now fuck me back together  (now put me back together)
You put a bullet into my heart (right into my heart)
Now fuck me back together
Come on, I'm an addict
Come on, gotta have it
Come on, let me at it tonight
You used your love to tear me apart (you used your love)
Now fuck me back together (fuck me back together)

[Outro: Robin Thicke]
Come on, I'm an addict
Come on, gotta have it
Come on, let me at it tonight
You used your love to tear me apart (you used your love)
Now fuck me back together
Fuck me back together

[Verse 1]
Baby, when I met you, there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine-tooth comb
I was soft inside
There was something going on

[Verse 2]
You do something to me that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got something going on

[Pre-Chorus]
Tender love is blind, it requires a dedication
All this love we feel needs no conversation
We ride it together, our heart
From one love to another, our heart

[Chorus]
Islands in the stream, that is what we are
No one in between, how can we be wrong?
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, our heart
From one lover to another, our heart

[Verse 3]
I can't live without you if the love has gone
Everything is nothing when you got no one
And you walk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the real thing

[Verse 4]
But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way out
And the message is clear
This could be the year for the real thing

[Pre-Chorus]
No more will you cry, baby, I will hurt you never
We start and end as one in love forever
We can ride it together, our heart
From one love to another, our heart

[Chorus]
Islands in the stream, that is what we are
No one in between, how can we be wrong?
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, our heart
From one lover to another, our heart

[Outro]
Oh, baby, alright
Ghetto superstar, that is what you are
Coming from afar, reaching for the stars
Fly away with me to another place
And we rely on each other, our heart
From one lover to another, our heart
So this is who I am
And this is all I know
And I must choose to live
For all that I can give
The spark that makes the power grow

And I will stand for my dream if I can
Symbol of my faith in who I am
But you are my only
And I must follow on the road, that lies ahead
And I won't let my heart control my head
But you are my only
And we don't say goodbye
We don't say goodbye
And I know what I've got to be

Immortality
I make my journey through eternity
I keep the memory of you and me
Inside
Fulfill your destiny
Is there within the child
My storm will never end
My fate is on the wind
The king of hearts, the joker's wild
We don't say goodbye
We don't say goodbye
I'll make them all remember me

'Cause I have found a dream that must come true
Every ounce of me must see it through
But you are my only
I'm sorry I don't have a role for love to play
Hand over my heart I'll find my way
I will make them give to me

Immortality
There is a vision and a fire in me
I keep the memory of you and me, inside
And we don't say goodbye
We don't say goodbye

With all my love for you
And what else we may do
We don't say, goodbye
I've been around the world
You'll never know just how long
I've been praying to get you into my life
It won't be long before you understand
Even our love becomes a master plan and so I

I think I'm walking on air
So much in love, I can't tell what I'm saying
There'll be no running away
You and I won't be apart again
I know in my heart that we can start again

Wait for the summer when love's in the air
You won't be sorry you answered my prayer

I see the games that you play
And I don't care what the people are saying
No other love can compare
Just to hold you in my arms again

I feel like walking on air
And just to dream you'll be there keeps me going
And all those days go by
We will never be apart again
Knowing our love will never die
Wait for the summer when love's in the air
We'll be together this time of the year

We will never be apart again
Knowing our love will never die

Here comes the summer with love in the air
You won't be sorry you answered my prayer

Here comes the summer and everyone's here
We will be sailing through year after year

You know I'm walking on air
I know I'm walking on air
You know I'm walking on air

[Verse 1]
Something you gave me
I focused on
A hundred moments 'ready sewn
Into my memory
But you still come loose though
The time it grows
I know you like to take it slow
But I got to know
That's why you've got to come here alone

[Hook]
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
Easy to find me
I'll take you to
The moments that you've never known
Keep for the future
Maybe we will stay here
Maybe somewhere close
But I'm never sure where you will go
So I've got to know
That's why you've got to come here alone

[Hook]
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh

Oooo ooo oooo oooo oooo ooooh

[Intro]
He was a big wave surfer
Livin' down by Waimea Bay
We had a few friends
Never thought it would end

[Verse 1]
I remember an all white day with 8-story waves
He said "Your eyes are gray" (Beautiful)
We were livin' on Côte d'Alene
On Carol Lane, sun Manta Ray

[Chorus]
Drivin' in our Mercury down to Waimea
Drivin' in our Mercury
Drivin' in our Mercury down to Waimea
Drivin' in our Mercury

You see me hanging around on the edges of town
I could be bad for you
And honey don't think about chasing this girl around
I could be bad for you

[Pre-Chorus]
And anywhere you go, I will follow
Even if it's only in spirit, baby
But honey you should go by tomorrow
I predict that shit's gonna get real crazy

[Chorus]
Leave while you still can
Before I take you down, take you down
Boy there's still a chance
For you to get out now, now, get out now, now, now

When you play the bass, I get this feeling
Just like the way, just like I'm dreaming
Out on the way, 

[?] another babe
How do I do it?

When you play the bass, I get this feeling
Baby
Never mind

You play the bass, I get this feeling
Sick from the wave, so hard to reel in
Roll me up a little cigarette, give me some of that, babe
Roll me up a little cigarette, give me some of that, babe

You play the bass, I get this feeling
Sick from the wave, so hard to reel in
Roll me up a little cigarette, give me some of that, babe
Roll me up a little cigarette, give me some of that, babe

When you play the bass, I get this feeling
My heart starts to race
Roll me up a little cigarette, give me some of that, babe
Roll me up a little cigarette, give me some of that, babe
So pretty

You play the bass
Don't say no, just let me go
Baby
I don't know
Lie me down
When you play the bass
I get this feeling
Heart starts to race
Now you say you're lonely
You cried the whole night through
Well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river honey
I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river baby
Cause I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me, right out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember, all that you said
You told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me and

Now you say, you say you love me
Well, just to prove you do
Come on boy, cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you
You say you're lonely
You cried the whole night through
Well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river baby
I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you
I cried a river over you

[Verse 1]
Cause you know girl
That every little thing you do
Even when i'm feeling blue
Oh, It makes me smile

[Pre-Chorus]
As we going through some stormy weather
Bless the fact we still move together
Cause I know we'll find the light on the other side

[Chorus]
Cause we’ll be just fine
If we take our time
Let the sun shine
Cause we’ll be just fine
Cause we’ll be just fine
If we take our time
Let the sun shine
Cause we’ll be just fine

[Verse 2]
Even when I’m going underwater
I can breathe just fine
Cause you got me in my prime girl
And it feels so good

[Pre-Chorus]
As we going through some stormy weather
Bless the fact we still move together
Cause I know we'll find the light on the other side

[Chorus]
Cause we’ll be just fine
If we take our time
Let the sun shine
Cause we’ll be just fine

[Sample: John F. Kennedy]
The artist, however faithful to his personal vision of reality, becomes the last champion of the individual mind and sensibility Against an intrusive society and an officious state
He has, as Frost said, a lover's quarrel with the world
In pursuing his perceptions of reality
He must often sail against the currents of his time
This is not a popular role
Yet in retrospect, we see how the artist's fidelity has strengthened the fibre of our national life
If sometimes our great artists have been the most critical of our society
It is because their sensitivity
And their concern for justice, which must motivate any true artist
Makes him aware that our Nation falls short of its highest potential
I see little of more importance to the future of our country and our civilization than full recognition of the place of the artist
If art is to nourish the roots of our culture
Society must set the artist free to follow his vision wherever it takes him
We must never forget that art is not a form of propaganda, it is a form of truth
For poets, there is nothing worse for our trade than to be in style
In free society art is not a weapon and it does not belong to the spheres of polemic and ideology
The highest duty of the writer, the composer, the artist is to remain true to himself
And to let the chips fall where they may

[Kid Cudi]
Hey let's have some fun this time

[Pre-Hook: Fall Out Boy]
I had so much champagne up in the club
And I ain’t come up here tonight looking for love
I’mma leave all my problems out on the floor
I’mma drink so much that I can’t make it home, home
So won't you take me home? Yeah
I had so much champagne up in the club
And I ain’t come up here tonight looking for love
I’mma leave all my problems out on the floor
I’mma drink so much that I can’t make it home, home
So won't you take me home? Yeah

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Now we rollin’ up, stayin’ out all night
Stayin’ out all night, stayin’ out all night
Getting drunk, stayin’ out all night
Stayin’ out all night, stayin’ out all night
Crashing a party, stayin’ out all night
Stayin’ out all night, stayin’ out all night
Getting this money, stayin’ out all night
Stayin’ out all night, stayin’ out all night

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Leaving all my problems at the door
Pouring up, soon as you think it’s enough, they bringin’ more
Hanging onto what niggas told me “get your paper up”
You work hard for what you got, they could never take it from you
All you need is a little patience, let me demonstrate
All my niggas in the game, we talkin’ ‘cause we been through it
Rolling weed in raw papers, taking shots, gin got me faded
If I get back to your spot, won’t know how I made it
Now I made my way in the game
So much money, don’t know how a nigga stayin’ the same
I’m too straight, I get high all day, I take it straight to the brain
I stay fly all week, like seven days on a plane
Came here to spend it not leave with it
Got KK rolled up, let my team hit it
Some Bombay, let’s sip ‘til it’s mayday
That fuck shit don’t play

[Pre-Hook: Fall Out Boy]
I had so much champagne up in the club
And I ain’t come up here tonight looking for love
I’mma leave all my problems out on the floor
I’mma drink so much that I can’t make it home, home
So won't you take me home? Yeah
I had so much champagne up in the club
And I ain’t come up here tonight looking for love
I’mma leave all my problems out on the floor
I’mma drink so much that I can’t make it home, home
So won't you take me home? Yeah

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah, keep the good times rollin’ and the champagne pourin’
On the plane and I don’t know where I’m goin’
Make sure my team keep ballin’ and the hoes keep callin’
And the money keep fallin’ on the floor
Where you tryna go, only care about what’s in your drink
Say you tryna go hard, don’t think about tomorrow
Don’t care about what people think
You don’t care about waitin’ outside
You be with everybody up in the front
You yellin’ “Face down, ass up” up in the club
And now we turning up (let’s party)
I’m in the club rolling weed like I’m Marley
Smoking dearly departed
That’s kill, too real, come to me, get it started
And the bottles be poppin’ like it's 4th of July
We just pourin’ them shots, back shooting corks in the sky
Pouring some for the girls and pouring more for my guys
Cause we made it my niggas, I just wanna thank my niggas
Hear them niggas talking shit, but they ain’t my niggas

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Now we rollin’ up, stayin’ out all night
Stayin’ out all night, stayin’ out all night
Getting drunk, stayin’ out all night
Stayin’ out all night, stayin’ out all night
Crashing a party, stayin’ out all night
Stayin’ out all night, stayin’ out all night
Getting this money, stayin’ out all night
Stayin’ out all night, stayin’ out all night

[Outro: Wiz Khalifa]
I had so much champagne up in the club
And I ain’t come up here tonight looking for love
I’mma leave all my problems out on the floor
I’mma drink so much that I can’t make it home
So won't you take me home? Yeah

[Verse 1]
She'll read your mind
She's smart as a whip
She'll suck you dry
But look at how much I drip?
At the point of ecstasy
I write a symphony
Of poetry in motion
And leavin' me there to die

[Verse 2]
I tell myself let no one take her place
To confide in someone
And look at how much I paid?
I want you next to me
Call it telepathy
We drifted into vision
And look at how much we see?
Ahh
Ah ahh

[Chorus]
I just wanna get closer than close to you
I know that one way or the other
Any test of my faith will do
And lovers fall for lovers' friends
We make each other cry
Livin' in each others lives
And tryin' to make the fantasy come true
I just wanna get closer than close to you, baby
I just wanna get closer than close to you

[Verse 3]
Your soul is naked
It tells you what you want?
I read your letter
And look at how close I've come?
There's more for us to see
In this philosophy
We both end up in Heaven
And look at how close we'd be
Ahh
Ah ahh

[Chorus]
I just wanna get closer than close to you
I know that one way or the other
Any test of my faith will do
I give my heart for you to break
I give my final breath
Nothin' last forever see
We can turn eternity into

[Chorus]
I just wanna get closer than close to you
To the moment you discover
What the best of my love can do
And lovers fall for lovers' friends
We make each other cry
Livin' in each others lives
And tryin' to make the fantasy come true
I just wanna get closer than close to you, baby
I just wanna get closer than close to you

[Outro]
I just wanna get closer than close to you
I just wanna get closer than close to you
(My love)
To the moment you discover
What the best of my love can do?
(My love)
Baby
I just wanna get closer than close to you
I just wanna get closer than close to you
(My love)
I know that one way or the other
Any test of my faith will do
(My love)
Baby
I just wanna get closer than close to you

[Chorus: Turntan]
Bashful creatures; the kids don't care at all
Bashful creatures; ratchet face and all
Oh, bashful creatures; I don't give a shit
Bashful creatures drown themselves in it

[Verse 1: Turntan]
I do not care who you are or the company you keep
Overall lack of concern with who sleeps in your sheets

[Verse 2: All]
Drink up to save mind of who you can't be
Tucked-in tank tops so you look more like me

[Pre-Chorus: Turntan]
You crawl in at dawn
Yes, you crawl in to mourn
Yes you crawl

[Chorus: Turntan & Beans]
Oh, bashful creatures; I don't give a fuck
Oh bashful creatures; running out of luck

[Post-Chorus: Turntan & Beans]
I do not care who you are, I don't care what you wear
I do not care who you are, I don't care who you scare

[Outro: Turntan,  All]
Don't try to fight it anymore
Don't try to fight it anymore
Don't try to fight it anymore
Don't try to fight it anymore
Don't try to fight it anymore
Don't try to fight it anymore
Don't try to fight it anymore
Don't try to fight it anymore

[Verse 1: Jake]
You came back
You wanted a piece of my heart or my love
You said you were clever
But clever is never enough

[Verse 2: Jake]
A tremble, a shiver
The patience is something you lack
Disastrous and matchless
The shivers that drip off your back

[Verse 3: Jake]
Try to repair what you never quite see
The reasons you spoke of but never had given to me

[Chorus: Jake, Jake & Nathan]
All gone, are you ever really here?
All gone, are you?
Got, got, got you, Sophie So
Got, got, got you

[Verse 4: Jake]
You came back
You wanted to see through my two-colored eyes
You left me at home
With a down-trodden handful of sighs

[Bridge: Jake & Nathan, All]
All gone, are you ever really here?
All gone, are you ever really here?
All gone, are you?
All gone, are you

[Outro: All]
All gone, are you?
You came back, you wanted
You came back, you wanted
You came back, you wanted
You came back, you wanted
You came back, you wanted
You came back, you wanted
You came back, you

[Hook]
See a party ain't a party til the Doc walk in it
It's hard to get it started til I hopped off in it
Then it got so crunk one minute
Since you didn't get to witness, just listen
I came in hot, and then I saw
As soon as I arrived then the shit popped off
The shit popped off
It's officially a gangsta party
You can leave, man she came to party
Then the shit popped off (Alright)
The shit popped off (Alright)
The shit popped off (Alright)
Said the shit popped off
Niggas hands in the air, bitches takin' tops off
Put the chronic in the air, and the shit popped off
The shit popped off

[Verse 1: T.I. as Dr. Dre]
Late California night, out chillin' I'm
Bout to fall up in the club we just killin time
Dro blowin', on Patron with a hint of lime
6-4 to the front door with top down
Hit the switches, the ignition, then hopped out
Crew walked in, shut the whole block down
Now, hit the door like "God damn
Hey is a party, ain't it? Man I don't understand
Why bitches over here, and niggas over there
The atmosphere so square, people so scared
To get up off the wall, and get up off they ass
To walk up on a broad, and get up on her ass"
I commandeer the turntable, that's my first mission
Because the DJ ain't spinnin' he bullshittin'
Go from California Love into Doggystyle
Bought out the bar hours, pulled out the starter now

[Hook]

[Verse 2: T.I.]
At the crib in L.A. when the phone ring
Pick it up, it's Dr. Dre, sayin' "It's on king"
I was on Hen, she was on lean
She was on gin, they all on the beam
Broads talkin' loud, and all talkin' bout
"We tired of sittin' in the house, when we going out?"
"Hey, shut the fuck up for a second, where you at Dre?
Text the address to me homie I'll be on the the way"
I make my way to the closet just for a second
Prepare myself to step into the party for a second
Check it, AKOO hoodie, blue denim, gray fitted cap
Louis rag, hit the stash, grab 50 stacks
I tell them bitches come on, get in the Maybach
57S headed straight to where Dre at
We pulled up to the spot lookin' like whoa
Line wrapped around the corner to the light pole
Latin chicks, black broads, couple white hoes
Who knows where the night might go, hit the door like
Yeah, blinded by the glare of the strobe light
See something I like, it's going down on sight

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I never thought that it'd be easy cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us and we're wondering how
No one has a solid answer, but just walking in the dark
And you can see the look on my face, it just tears me apart

[Pre-Chorus]
So we fight through the hurt
And we cry and cry and cry and cry
Then we live and we learn
And we try and try and try and try

[Chorus]
So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to Earth
Down to Earth, down to Earth
On our way back down to Earth
Ooh, woah, ooh

[Verse 2]
And mama you were always somewhere, and daddy I live out of town
So tell how could I ever be normal somehow?
You tell me this is for the best, so tell me why am I in tears?
Woah, so far away, and now I just need you here

[Pre-Chorus]
So we'll fight through the hurt
And we'll cry and cry and cry and cry
Then we live and we learn
And we try and try and try and try

[Chorus]
So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to Earth
Down to Earth, down to Earth
On our way back down to Earth
Ooh, woah, ooh

[Bridge]
We fell so far away from where we used to be
And now we're standing and where do we go?
When there's no road to get to your heart
Let's start over again

[Chorus]
So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to Earth
Down to Earth, down to Earth
On our way back down to Earth

[Outro]
I never thought that it'd be easy
Cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
And we're wondering how

[Intro]
Oh, yeah, mm

[Verse 1]
I'd wait on you forever and a day, hand and foot
Your world is my world, yeah
Ain't no way you ever gon' get
Any less than you should

[Chorus]
Cause baby you smile I smile, woah
Cause whenever you smile, I smile, oh

[Verse 2]
Your lips, my biggest weakness
Shouldn't have let you know, I'm always gonna do what they say, yeah
If you need me I'll come running
From a thousand miles away

[Chorus]
When you smile I smile, oh
And whenever you smile, I smile, oh

[Verse 3]
Baby take my open heart and all it offers
Cause this is as unconditional as it'll ever get
You ain't seen nothing yet
I won't ever hesitate to give you more

[Chorus]
Cause baby you smile, I smile, whoa
You smile, I smile, oh
And whenever you smile, I smile, I smile, I smile, I smile
You smile, I smile, oh

[Bridge]
Baby you won't ever want for nothing, you are my ends and my means now
With you there's no in between, I'm all in
Cause my cards are on the table and I'm willing and I'm able
But I fold to your wish cause it's my command

[Chorus]
Whenever you smile, I smile, whoa
You smile, I smile, I smile, I smile, I smile
You smile, I smile
And whenever you smile, I smile

[Outro]
When you smile, I smile
You smile, I smile

[Intro]
Said if they follow me and pop again
I'm gonna hit them with the knockout

[Verse 1]
I see you watching out of your eye
You're not gonna win, but you might as well try
You break me down, you're not like other guys, oh no
So jump on in, if you're ready to crash
So drive me fast 'cause this will not last
But you got me, you turn the magic on tonight

[Chorus]
Got my x-ray specs, they are watching you
I can see you making your every move
Give me your heart on a rope like an old yo-yo
Got my x-ray specs and they're watching you

[Verse 2]
You have got me under your spell
And I want to get to know you well
So tell me what you like and what to do, to you
'Cause I like to be like a super freak
You can put me in positions, gonna make you weak
So just hush your eyes and shut your mouth, don't speak to me

[Chorus]
Got my x-ray specs, they are watching you
I can see you making your every move
Give me your heart on a rope like an old yo-yo
Got my x-ray specs and they're watching you

[Bridge]
No money in the bank account
We can stay in, you can check me out
Get down on the leather couch
Spin that bottle, c'mon, let's make out
Loving all the things that you do to me
Like it when you go down, let's get freaky
My hand wherever you want me
Double double dare you, let's get crazy

[Interlude]
X-ray specs, watching you
Watching you
X-ray specs, watching you
Watching you

[Chorus]
Got my x-ray specs, they are watching you
I can see you making your every move
Give me your heart on a rope like an old yo-yo
Got my x-ray specs and they're watching you
Got my x-ray specs, they are watching you
I can see you making your every move
Give me your heart on a rope like an old yo-yo
Got my x-ray specs and they're watching you

[Outro]
Got my x-ray specs, they are watching you
Got my x-ray specs, they are watching you
Got my x-ray specs, they are watching you
X-ray specs, watching you
X-ray specs
X-ray specs, watching you
X-ray specs
X-ray specs

[Intro]
High-igh-igh-igh
High-igh-igh-igh

[Verse 1]
Boy, look at you, lookin' at me
I know you know how I feel
Lovin' you is hard, bein' here's harder
You take the wheel
I don't wanna do this anymore
It's so surreal
I can't survive
If this is all that's real

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by, baby, baby, bye bye
The truth is I never bought into your bullshit
When you would pay tribute to me 'cause I know that
All I wanted to do was get high by the beach
Get high, baby, baby, bye bye

[Verse 2]
Boy, look at you, lookin' at me
I know you don't understand
You could be a bad motherfucker
But that don't make you a man
Now you're just another one of my problems
Because you got out of hand
We won't survive
We're sinkin' into the sand

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by baby, baby, bye bye
The truth is I never bought into your bullshit
When you would pay tribute to me 'cause I know that
All I wanted to do was get high by the beach
Get high, baby, baby, bye bye

[Bridge]
Lights, camera, acción
I'll do it on my own
Don't need your money, money
To get me what I want
Lights, camera, acción
I'll do it on my own
Don't need your money, money
To get me what I want

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by baby, baby, bye bye
The truth is I never bought into your bullshit
When you would pay tribute to me 'cause I know that
All I wanted to do was get high by the beach
Get high, baby, baby, bye bye

[Harmonization]
High-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh
High-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh
High-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh
High-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh

[Outro]
Anyone can start again
Not through love, but through revenge
Through the fire, we're born again
Peace by vengeance, brings the end
(High-igh-igh-igh)

[Verse 1]
There's a man who's been out sailing
In a decade full of dreams
And he takes her to a schooner
And he treats her like a queen
Bearing beads from California
With their amber stones and green

[Chorus 1]
He has called her from the harbor
He has kissed her with his freedom
He has heard her off to starboard
In the breaking and the breathing of the water weeds
While she was busy being free

[Verse 2]
There's a man who's climbed a mountain
And he's calling out her name
And he hopes her heart can hear
Three thousand miles, he calls again
He can think her there beside him
He can miss her just the same

[Chorus 2]
He has missed her in the forest
While he showed her all the flowers
And the branches sang the chorus
As he climbed the scaly towers of a forest tree
While she was somewhere being free

[Verse 3]
There's a man who's sent a letter
And he's waiting for reply
He has asked her of her travels
Since the day they said goodbye
He writes "Wish you were beside me
We can make it if we try"

[Chorus 3]
He has seen her at the office
With her name on all his papers
Through the sharing of the profits
He will find it hard to shake her from his memory
And she's so busy being free

[Verse 4]
There's a lady in the city
And she thinks she loves them all
There's the one who's thinking of her
There's the one who sometimes calls
There's the one who writes her letters
With his facts and figures scrawl

[Chorus 4]
She has brought them to her senses
They have laughed inside her laughter
Now she rallies her defenses
For she fears that one will ask her for eternity
And she's so busy being free

[Verse 5]
There's a man who sends her medals
He is bleeding from the war
There's a jouster and a jester
And a man who owns a store
There's a drummer and a dreamer
And you know there may be more

[Chorus 5]
She will love them when she sees them
They will lose her if they follow
And she only means to please them
And her heart is full and hollow like a cactus tree
While she's so busy being free

[Outro]
Like a cactus tree
Being free
(Clapping)

[Verse 1]
Everyone's happy
Finally it's the weekend
All the hard work's behind me, yeah
And I just invited all my friends
I'm bout to throw something on the grill
And get together and play some cards, yeah
A couple of drinks, something to smoke and do our thing
No one's got hatin' in their hearts

[Hook]

Everybody listen, you know how we do
A backyard party
We got drink to  drinks potato chips
And barbecue
A backyard party
The sun is shining and the sky's so blue
A backyard party
I've been around and I've seen some things
People moving faster than the speed of sound
Faster than the speeding bullet
People living like Superman
All day and all night
And I won't say if it's wrong or if it's right
I'm pretty fast myself
But I do have some advice to pass along
Right here in the words of this song

Better not look down
If you want to keep on flying
Put the hammer down
Keep it full speed ahead
Better not look back
Or you might just wind up crying
You can keep it moving
If you don't look down

An old girl friend of mine showed up the other day
That girl have lived in love and for love
And over love, and under love all her life
If the arrows from cupid's bow that had
Passed through her heart had been sticking
Out of her body she would have looked like
A porcupine, and she asked me
B.B. do you think I've lived my life all wrong?
And I said: The only advice I have to pass
Along is concealed in the chorus of this song
Girl
Better not look down
If you want to keep on flying
Put the hammer down
Keep it full speed ahead
Better not look back
Or you might just wind up crying
You can keep it moving
If you don't look down

I was walking down the street at sunrise one morning
In London, England
And there was a very large Rolls Royce Limousine
Pulling slowly along the street
And in that Rolls Royce was the Queen of England
Looking tired
Just go back from a party, and the Queen leaned out and
She said: Aren't you B.B. King? She said:
Oh B.B., sometimes it's so hard to pull things together
Could you tell me what you think I ought to do?
And I said:

You better not look down
If you want to keep on flying
Put the hammer down
Keep it full speed ahead
Better not look back
Or you might just wind up crying
You can keep it moving
If you don't look down
You better not look down
If you want to keep on flying
Put the hammer down
Keep it full speed ahead
Better not look back
Or you might just wind up crying
You can keep it moving
If you don't look down

You better not look down
If you want to keep on flying
Put the hammer down
Keep it full speed ahead
Better not look back

[Verse 1: V Bozeman & Timbaland]
Through the rain or shine, I'll be there when you call me
(There when you call me)
You're my favorite song that I sing in the morning
You're the cream to my coffee
You're the sound of my heart beat
Baby you're that winner, can't lose cause I got that winner
Can't lose if I got you here
Oh, I would climb or move any day that you ask me (ask me)
Need no parachute, cause your loves gonna catch me
If you're there then I'm happy
If you're not then I'm crappy
You make everything better
When it pours baby you're my umbrella
Even on my worst day

[Chorus: Together]
I know that we gon' make it when I see you smile
See you smile
Yeah, I know that we gon' make it when I see you smile
So let me turn that frown upside down
Let's just toast to love that we found, yeah
'Cause I know that we gon' make it when I see you smile
See you smile

[Verse 2: Timbaland &  V Bozeman]
Oh, when the chips are down, I'd bid you all that I got (all that I got)
With your poker face, we can still hit the jackpot
Then we ball 'til we cash out, then we ball 'til we cash out
I ain't leaving you never, I ain't lea-lea-leaving you never, never yeah
Oh when I need a lift baby, you never let me down
And when I fall off you put me right back together now
Put me right back together now, put me right back together now
I ain't leaving you never, I ain't lea-lea-leaving you never
Even on my worst day

[Chorus: Together]
I know that we gon' make it when I see you smile
See you smile (when I see you smile)
Yeah, I know that we gon' make it when I see you smile
So let me turn that frown upside down
Let's just toast to love that we found, yeah
'Cause I know that we gon' make it when I see you smile (we gon' make it)
See you smile (we gon' make it now now)

[Outro: Simultaneous: V Bozeman (Timbaland)]

Go

Go
Go
Eve never pleases me and kitty can
Eve never pleases me and kitty can

When kitty smiles, the world stands still
I see a thousand golden daffodils
But when she cries, the world just dies
I see a million tears in kitty's eyes

Eve never pleases me and kitty can
Eve never pleases me and kitty can

Now Eve is bad and treats me cruel
She loves to see me looking like a fool
I find a way with words I say
To be in love in such a lonely way

Eve never pleases me and kitty can
Eve never pleases me and kitty can

Now they are two and I am one
I cannot fall in love with everyone
So I must choose between the two
Made up my mind, now I am choosing you
Eve never pleases me and kitty can
Eve never pleases me and kitty can

[Verse 1]
Well, I been thinking too much
That I've been thinking too much
Seems like everyone's talking 'bout money
So, I've got to get me some
My baby's crying
So now my baby's crying
We always fighting for money
But, girl, I ain't got the time

[Instrumental]
Grind

[Verse 2]
Ain't no way we lying
I want my green and gold
Uh, people dying for this money
Uh, might not be around too long
So I'm gone, yeah, I'm gone, yeah
Oh, I'm gone, I'm gone
I'm gone, don't know when I'll be home
Just got to get to some money
I got this story of mine
Uh, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm way too old
To give a shit
I bite my tongue
To see what benny did
A funny joke
A funny
Message on the machine

[Verse 2]
I trip around
Keep to myself
I'll write another song
About somebody else
Who seems like me
But there is no one
Inside of this body

[Verse 3]
He likes the icing
Not the cake
Says he wants to
Trade my
Fucking place
Do me a favor
Kill your beer
I wanna
Get the hell out of here

[Intro: Mac Miller]
I wrote this under the influence of narcotics
Yeah
Play them horns!
Young raspy god

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah, um
Why you fuckin' up my good mood?
The Bimmer used but it look new
Your raps dry as overcooked food
My shit is kaboom
I took shrooms, now I'm playin' dodgeball in a crooked room
So address me as your superior
Mind on delirium, ice-cold interior
Stirrin' up the chaos, I'm the cause of the confusion
Young, grown-ass nuisance with the strength of 22 men
Pukin' all over your brand new accoutrements
Lucrative, assassin them, shoot to miss
I turn my body into Eucharist
Nail me to a crucifix
If I'm gonna kill myself, then I'ma do it big
Scalin' Mount Vesuvius
We don't even know what bein' human is
And what's a man when he lose his wits?
Useless as the news at six
Foolish, we nothin' but a bunch of rotten and stupid kids

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I wanna (I wanna), I wanna punch you (Punch you, punch you)
I wanna (I wanna), wanna, I wa—, I wanna punch you (Punch you, punch you)
I wanna, I wanna punch you in your fuckin' face (Pow, bitch)
Hahaha (Yeah), yeah

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
You live inside a computer
In 2014, religion turn to rumor
Maneuver through the world in a Uber
Born to be a loser to the world, I'm just a tumor they'll remove
If I would've done my schoolwork
I could've been a Oklahoma Sooner with a golden retriever I named Cooper
Work part-time at Bruegger's
Workin' on securin' me a future, the American dream
Big titty bitches guaranteed a spot on the team
Bust inside my pants, leave a spot on my jeans
Clean it up
Why are pretty girls always mean to us?
I'm the Godzilla of mess
Leave my house forgettin' that I'm still in a dress
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
Blam, blam, blam, blam, blam, blam, blam
Gun sounds, gun sounds

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I wanna (I wanna), I wanna punch you (Punch you)
I wanna (I wanna), wanna, I wa—, I wanna punch you (Punch you)
I wanna, I wanna punch you in your fuckin' face (Pow, bitch)
Hahaha (Yeah), yeah
I wanna (I wanna), I wanna punch you (Punch you)
I wanna (I wanna), wanna, I wa—, I wanna punch you (Punch you)
I wanna, I wanna punch you in your fuckin' face (Pow, bitch)
Hahaha (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Sean Price]
I'm worldwide, but I smack clowns local
Gunshots, M.O.P. background vocals
Fire in the hole of the designer of your clothes
On the up and up, you fuckin' up, why you fuckin' with those?
Planet of the apes, the survival of the goons
I'm so dope, you could put the lighter on the spoon
I'm tightest with the tunes, need a verse and I write it, son
Master shit with no practice, bitch, Al Iverson
Fuck the king of New York, in my presence they all peasants
The king is all talk
Whoever holdin' the crown
Better pass that shit to me, P, I'm holdin' it down
Fuck if you the greatest
A lot of rappers got killed, fuck around and be the latest
Your bars warm, my shit smokin'
I pitch Knicks at my pace, I'm Chris Copeland
Yeah

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I wanna (I wanna), I wanna punch you (Punch you)
I wanna (I wanna), wanna, I wa—, I wanna punch you (Punch you)
I wanna, I wanna punch you in your fuckin' face (Pow, bitch)
Hahaha (Yeah), yeah
I wanna (I wanna), I wanna punch you (Punch you)
I wanna (I wanna), wanna, I wa—, I wanna punch you (Punch you)
I wanna, I wanna punch you in your fuckin' face (Pow, bitch)
Hahaha (Yeah), yeah

[Outro]

[Intro]
Hi, break over. This is the other new song that I wrote that I was telling you about. It's called "I Was Born To Take The Highway".
I wrote it between Toronto and Detroit, on the highway.

[Verse 1]
See the stretching sun at dawning
Wipe the stardust from his eyes
Feel the morning breezes yawning
Telling me it's time to rise
Telling me it's time to rise

[Chorus]
I was born to take the highway
I was born to chase a dream
Any road at all is my way
Any place is where I've been
Anything is what I've seen

[Verse 2]
Gambler's gold is meant for squandering
Miser's silver is to hoard
My gold 'cross the sky goes wandering
My silver is a drinking gourd
My silver is the drinking gourd

[Chorus]
I was born to take the highway
I was born to chase a dream
Any road at all is my way
Any place is where I've been
Anything is what I've seen

[Verse 3]
I've skipped on concrete, danced on cobbles
Stepped on pavement in the heat
I've seen where children crouched at marbles
Drew chalk circles in the street
Found a penny at my feet

[Chorus]
I was born to take the highway
I was born to chase a dream
Any road at all is my way
Any place is where I've been
Anything is what I've seen

[Verse 4]
Now, I know a road that winds forever
Through the land the rainbows run
You cross the bridge from now 'til never
Take the first turn past the sun
Take the first turn beyond the sun

[Chorus]
I was born to take the highway
I was born to chase a dream
Any road at all is my way
Any place is where I've been
Anything is what I've seen
(Intro)
Huh huh, Smoke some of that Gucci Gas, huh

If I don't drank to day-y I rather die-e
Lord, I get High-ahah, I don't know why-ay
If I don't drank to day-y I rather die-e

[Verse 1]
I found a new way
To open up my mind
I'd love to tell you 'bout it, honey
If you could find the time

And I can see the future
I can see the weather change
I can see from here to L.A
And I know that everywhere's the same, oh yeah

[Chorus]
I found a way
I found a way
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
I found a new way
To open up the day
All you gotta do is follow me through
And I know that you'll be okay
And I found a new way
To open up my mind
All you gotta do is follow me through
And I know that you'll be fine, oh yeah

[Chorus]
I found a way
I found a way
I found a new way

[Verse 3]
I found a new way
A new way to see
Just come over here and give me your ear
Let me tell you how good it could be

I can see the future
I can see the weather change
I can see from here to New York City
And I know that every place is the same, oh yeah

[Chorus]
I found a way
I found a way
I'm scared to death
Scared to death
Scared to death
Let me say

[Chorus]
I found a way
I found a way
I see the dark sky coming
And I know it's on its way

Threw my set up one time
Niggas looking from the floor
I'm gonna love ya, like no one could
Make your heart feel the way it should
I'm gonna hold ya, when no one would
'Cause I swear you deserve so good

Livin' up in California
Lovin' life that I've been waiting for the
Push my dreams into my fate
Sometimes I hope it's not too late

I wanna love ya,

I wanna love ya, like no one could

I'm gonna love ya, like no one could
Make your heart feel the way it should
I'm gonna hold ya, when no one would
'Cause I swear you deserve so good

~Melody~
Sometimes it's hard to have the upper hand
When every dream you had is turning into sand
You need someone to make your day
But he took your breath and blew it away

I'm gonna love ya, like no one could
Make your heart feel the way it should
I'm gonna hold ya, when no one would
'Cause I swear you deserve so good

I wanna love ya,
I wanna love ya,
I wanna love ya, like no one could

I wanna love ya,
I wanna love ya,
I wanna love ya, like no one could

~Melody~

I wanna love ya,

Born prodigy no apologies fuck a policy
Fuck around and make a monster out of me
A monster gotta eat, coming for the weak
Run to your momma but it's late and your momma gotta sleep

[Hook: Jon Bellion]
I apologize for the violence
I swear I'm killing every single thing I touch
Let's have a moment of silence
For anyone that thinks that I could give two fucks
I apologize for the violence
I apologize for the violence

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
(Yeah)In this game friendships don't last long
They last about as long as a hit song
So I keep a full clip full of hit songs
So when I get to busting it's a shit storm
Everyone's a bit dumb, let that bitch hum
Roll the drum till I get it out my system
Line them all up, wack niggas first
Take them out the game won't think twice, won't miss one
When you hot imitators try to mimic you
'Fore I was hot I was begging for an interview
There's only one of me, but there's a million yous
If you was that important then I'd remember you
Well I guess I'm too in the mix
Next known flow I'm on some Jupiter shit
Hundred deep on some hooligan shit
Killing everything I see on some funeral shit

[Hook: Jon Bellion]
I apologize for the violence
I swear I'm killing every single thing I touch
Let's have a moment of silence
For anyone that thinks that I could give two fucks
I apologize for the violence

I apologize for the violence

Psychedelic thoughts, psychedelic calls
From these psychedelic trees and I think it's rubbing off on me
I think it's rubbing off on me, I think it's rubbing off
Faded memories, every face I can't recall
Who the fuck are you, we was never cool, you ain't my dog homie
You ain't my dog, don't reach
Yeah, yeah, you ain't my dog
Psychedelic thoughts, psychedelic calls
From these psychedelic trees and I think it's rubbing off on me
I think it's rubbing off on me, I think it's rubbing off
Faded memories, every face I can't recall
Who the fuck are you, we was never cool, you ain't my dog homie
You ain't my dog, don't reach
Yeah, yeah, you ain't my dog

[Verse 1]
I'm searching for an outlet tryna charge my phone
Looking through my contacts ain't no one to call
Questions that need answers, looking for escape
I'm just looking for that high, can ya help me elevate?
Can ya, can ya help me elevate?
Can ya help me elevate?
Can ya help me elevate?
Can ya help me elevate?
Imagine modern day civilization as we know it just collapsing
Television screens and news reports just serve as a distraction
Propaganda got our minds so flooded that we just paddlin'
Damn it, drowing for air, we keep gaspin' for breath
I take a step, you take a step, I take a step
Living out our dreams till nothing's left, till there ain't none left
Bury me in honor, we will not forget to fallen soldiers
I pay respect, I pay respect, I wear the burden
Of the world ever since I travelled on a jet
To a far away place in a third-world city where the whole damn country was oppressed
Couldn't help but stomach what I saw but still my conscious was upset
With all the money in the world I really wanna but I can’t express
Some thoughts is trapped inside my head so I roll a blunt to ease my stress
I traveled through the USA where people constantly obsess
Over all this shit that wouldn't matter if we knew what was ahead
Signing off, psychedelic thoughts running through my head

[Hook]
Psychedelic thoughts, psychedelic calls
From these psychedelic trees and I think it's rubbing off on me
I think it's rubbing off on me, I think it's rubbing off
Faded memories, every face I can't recall
Who the fuck are you, we was never cool, you ain't my dog homie
You ain't my dog, don't reach
Yeah, yeah, you ain't my dog
Psychedelic thoughts, psychedelic calls
From these psychedelic trees and I think it's rubbing off on me
I think it's rubbing off on me, I think it's rubbing off
Faded memories, every face I can't recall
Who the fuck are you, we was never cool, you ain't my dog homie
You ain't my dog, don't reach
Yeah, yeah, you ain't my dog

Plain Jane
She didn't like Jane Plain
She was smiling to hide Jane's pain
But there was something about Plain Jane
Yes there was something about her

[Hook]
She couldn't find her purpose
So she couldn't see her worth
Plain Jane (x10)
Yes there was something about her

[Verse 1]
Tell me Jane
Why you can't look at the brighter things?
You think
That you're so plain
You hate your body and you want to exchange
So you go and do the doctor thing
And the doctor asks what you want to change
You don't know
You can't explain
Something about Plain Jane

[Hook]
She couldn't find her purpose
So she couldn't see her worth
Plain Jane (x10)
Yes there was something about her

[Verse 2]
Well Jane is
Her name
And she lives in the souls of those
Who can't escape
Being vain
And she looks in the mirror with pain
And she feels ashamed
So strange
So wrapped up in the pain
She even hates
Her name
And she won't entertain the sunshine
Because her life is rain
And she's sick of playing all the games
But still she drowns, again
There's something about Plain Jane

[Outro]
Jane
Plain Jane
J-J-J-J-Jane
Plain Jane
She didn't like Jane Plain
She was smiling to hide Jane's pain
But there was something about Plain Jane
Yes there was something about Plain Jane

Got a trophy I don't play for the league but she can get this recreational D, okay
Go and put your hourglass on my three legged stand, right
Pussy singing like, Tina back when she first got that advance, 'ight?
Beat it up like boogie nights, boogie nights

Lay it down baby, tablecloth
Cheers to the good night, make a toast
You be doin' everything but the most
Put my hands on the hourglass, grippin' ass
Rollin' weed, call it multitask
Niggas multiask like, "What's your number like, you look good like, what you doin' later like, can I come through and spend some time or..?"

[Pre-hook]

[Verse 1]
I'm in this apartment that I don't want no one to know
Dressed up for stages and faces in similar clothes
And always I'm venting and always inventing a song, ooh
And always ascending drifting into the unknown

[Hook]
I wonder if we are living a show so tell me I gotta know
If I were to be honest and bold would I be a hero
Cause if you can see the colours that glow inside my soul
If were to bleed my blood would flow a violet Vibrato
La-la-la-la, la-la (x4)

[Verse 2]
Communication is so amazing when shown
As we awaken and all the pages unfold
From such a beautiful life (x2)
Ooh ooh

Ooh, unsuccessful people talk the most shit that's just what they do

Bloody red eyes
Bloody red eyes
Bloody red eyes
Bloody red eyes

[Verse 1]
Ooh, niggas always talking cause it so cheap
Ooh, this is how it look when you don't sleep
Ooh, strangers always acting like they know me
Ooh, fresh up off work 'bout to roll tree

And I don't say shit, even if they owed me
All I remember is, what my momma told me, my momma told me

Snakes, they always smiling in your faces
Fake friends, yeah they just fake it till they make it
Until they make it, that's when they act the fakest
Shit go from "You like family" to "Fuck nah, we ain't related"
So fuck nah, we ain't related there's no affiliation
Money always take a good thing and complicate shit
How you stop yourself from a mistake before you make it
If you never seen a problem can't solve for the equation
So niggas out here underestimating
Even a fuck you takes up too much time and energy to say it
And if time is money I won't mind in the AM
Don't wake me in the AM unless you talking 8 M's
Who really down? Who really gon' hold you down?
Them niggas ain't really your dog, they be fucking your bitch when you out of town
You was blind till now
Every hand that come to the king to protect, they be close cause they want that crown
But soon as the shine wears off they're nowhere to be found
Down

Like beating drums, your heart never sleeps
We've been dancing all night, dancing machine
From the club to the floor, to your limousine
Ooh-ooh-ooh (x8)

[Verse 1]
I love all your nuances, I love all your nuances
Forgive me if I'm too honest girl that booty humongous baby you must do lunges
And up top two congas, girl you rarer than a blue comet
I'ma, keep it a million like two commas
I wanna beat it up like Ali, Muhammad
Girl you're too dope, you're too chronic, you keep it two hundred
Two piece, that's two freaks, that's two gins and two tonics
Who run it, No Genre you dumby
She love the whole crew so she payed the crew homage
Smelling like new money, new money
KL to Joburg we just played a few countries
Get out your seat hit the floor put your groove on it girl

[Hook]

[Bridge]
What you looking for?
Party girl, you want it girl
You run yo mouth, not hooking up
And put it down we go see

One time, hit you with it one time
No strings attached but you tongue tied
Give me my guitar g string imma strum
She gon need a salon, ?
Ay back it up, CD ROM Drive
She gonna get deep like the dumb kind
She brought a lil tree like bonsai
She gon learn today, I'm the alumni
Ay shes a drug that I've taken so much of
So much of, I could barely get a buzz off a pub
A puff ain't enough, looking for a substance to touch
Or a substance ? in this club
Heat it up till you blush
Feel the rush feel the rush
Is it love is it lust?
Ill be the judge
Give ya body a rub

[Hook]

[Pre-Hook]
We are the have-nots who never had nothing
But learned to make something, out of never having nothing at all
And you could have it all and feel you never need nothing
But he who loves nothing will never have nothing at all

[Hook]
And you could be a superstar
But still feel like an outlaw
And never need nothing at all
But still have an empty heart

[Verse 1]
When me and my sister was literally playin' in dirt
I can still see the smile on her face, in my head I can still see the mud on my shirt
Fuckin' freezing my ass off at night with this match, tryna get this lil' fire to work
And my mom just got fired from work, and meanwhile we was gettin' evicted
Our living condition was not ideal but some kinda way we learned
That growing up poor don't make you real
They don't want to see us happy, they just sell us Happy-Meals
So we throw these records on, it's the only thing that has appeal
And the sadness disappears, so what's up with us
What to do with us, they don't know what to do
All they can do is call us thugs till they need they problem solve
Need someone to run they club
He who doesn't love what he has will never have enough

[Pre-Hook]
We are the have-nots who never had nothing
But learned to make something, out of never having nothing at all

But still feel like an outlaw
And never need nothing at all

Laughing in my cutest coupe
Coming through the hood killing shit just like the funeral
O to the schi nigga you know me

Been an og I've been getting guap
All the money can't fit in no Timberland
I won't stop 'til I cop a house as big as your project block
Plus I like to shop a lot so I got to get this guap
Grind grind all the time 24/7 365

Dollar sign, dollar sign, dollar sign, dollar sign, dollar signs

And I'm her Superman ain't no telling what coupe I'm in

Twenty-two dark rims, what you do nothing
Puffing on that kryptonite I'm gon' feel them lift tonight
If she don't suck my dick alright I just tell that bitch get nice
You ain't got no red stripes on your kicks
Them diamonds they look like a red light to a bitch
Make her stop, freeze, and everything's a go
We got that purple by the pound we got that work all by that O
You already know, this gon' ball the Audemar the way it glow
I keep them stacks in my pocket and that's all just for your hoe
Now let's go, that's when she stay

Pussy so wet and slippery I need traction

Clocking like a a wrist watch that Lambo make a bitch stop
She be hypnotized, hypnotized like I'm Big Pop

[Verse 4: Meek Mill]
Like you Big Pop well I'm like Shakur
I just dick her down I don't wife the whore
She say that I'm cool smoother than velour

[Outro: Meek Mill]

[Hook: Sevyn Streeter]
Love the way you're livin' baby, never wanna waste your time
Love it when you touch my body, makes me wanna give you mine
It's so wrong, but it feels so right
Cause I love this feeling, and I love this life
Said I love this life, life, yeah

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
This is craziness, addicted to the pain of love and hate relationship
Or can I break a heart or can we argue breakin' shit?
I guess I take the fault for what my occupation is
The more the money come, the more bizarre the day can get
Bizarre the day can get
It cost bread to join the game but even more to escape the shit
I see calculated cowards taking calculated risks
This the art or making music or the art of faking shit?
This the truth, I give these boys the blues this is proof
But it's nothing they can tell me, tt's nothing they can do
To take my touch away, take my love away, I play to win
Backstage, first we say the prayer, then we say amen
Bands!

[Hook: Sevyn Streeter]
Love the way you're livin' baby, never wanna waste your time
Love it when you touch my body, makes me wanna give you mine
It's so wrong, but it feels so right
Cause I love this feeling, and I love this life
Said I love this life, life
It's so wrong, but it feels so right
Cause I love this feeling, and I love this life

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
This is craziness, this is craziness
Spending money before I make it, never learn to wait for shit
Tryna pack a stadium, you tryna catch the latest trends
The line between the good and bad is paper thin
Goodness gracious, I might have enemies in high places
They surveillance but can't keep up with how my mind races
How I'm steppin' on these niggas like I've got my own rep
Nigga be omega, beta salutations to the haters, chuck the deuce
You say what's up with me, what's up with you?
It's nothing they could tell me, it's nothing they can do
To take my touch away, to take my love away, I play to win
Swagger woodstock status, guess that's why they call me Bands
Bands!

[Hook: Sevyn Streeter]
Love the way you're livin' baby, never wanna waste your time
Love it when you touch my body, makes me wanna give you mine
It's so wrong, but it feels so right
Cause I love this feeling, and I love this life
Said I love this life
Said I love this life
It's so wrong, but it feels so right
Cause I love this feeling, and I love this life

So I pick up where I left off, yes, I still go hard
This the payback to them bitches who can't write their own bars

Preference is in Pluto, where I sight see all the stars
Out in Highland smoking violet, my, wallet's on a diet
Surfin' cheddy choppin' lettuce in Chebahtah

I'm a dude now, I should try this
Cause I kind of...

Holy shit, niggas in the- back, with a..

[Verse 1]
Oh, what'cha want with the town that you can't put your eye on?
It's the train put out there, and looking done
What'cha doing sending sisters to the other side?
It's hard enough, hard enough
What'cha doing with the cam, with the cam in your hand?
While they're walking here, here to follow you
What'cha doing with the cam, what you can with the cam?
Just blow it up, blow it up

[Chorus]
It's easy
Come back
True love
Every night, every night
It's easy
Come back
Gone, but
Single now, single now

What'cha doing with the cam that you can't put down?
'Cause then you're walking
You're playing cool to get
But what you can't get, get a man can't forget
Take a cool pair, I'm a nice devil
What'cha doing with the cat that you can't believe?
I don't love myself, I call child police
Oh, what'cha doing with the cat that you can't believe?
Just blow it up

[Chorus]
It's easy
Come back
True love
Every night, every night
It's easy
Come back
Gone, but

[Intro: Anderson .Paak]
Surfs the way he acts
You'll never know what he's going to do next
But one thing is for sure
It will either be radical or funny, or both
Say, I’m on, I’m on, 2am in the morn'
Still, I’m ready, even if I don’t go
Baby girl, I’m still holdin' on since I popped out the hole
Still, I’m ready if I don’t go

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
Said
I’m naked down to my socks, bitch, I’m Anthony Kiedis
All this Charmin I got, put that right to your sneezer
Ride around on my block, VTA 2K Teasey (2K Teasey)
Fuck the police, okay, back to my thesis
Hoes: don’t love ‘em, don’t treat ‘em, I just teach ‘em to stroke ‘em
Pass that over to LODEF, he gon’ pass it to Jose
He gon’ lend it to Mikos, okay, bases are loaded
If she make it to Parker, she MVP with the trophy
Like Eric Wright with the shotty, Curtis May with the fender
Flava Flav wit' the clock, I had no time to play pitcher
You niggas acting like goalies, you's a hatin’ defender
I stay on Ps and Qs since the top of my sentence

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
And I’m ready if I don’t go
Don’t go, I don’t go
I’m ready, but don’t go
Don’t go, don’t
Motherfucker, I’m ready

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
They oughta know, they oughta see
How you feeling, uhhh, that's that Master P! (It's that Master P)
Did you roll or make it mine (Make your mind up)
We stay whole and you can wind (You can wind up)
Pick on the floor-da, they gonna pop that cola
Bitch niggas wanna roll up, bitch nigga, here, get rolled up
Slow motion, watch me bend that corner (Bend that corner)
Slow motion, then she give me more, muh
I can’t stand what you got
Girl, your ass is Movado, I can’t help but to watch
Collard greens in my pot
All these clouds, I think I finally see the top, and motherfucker

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
I’m ready if I don’t go
I don’t go, I don’t go
I’m ready if I don’t go
If I don’t go, if I don’t go
Motherfucker, I’m ready
I don’t go
I’m ready
If I don’t go, if I don’t
Motherfucker, I’m ready

[Outro: SiR]
If you got a problem, we can light it up
Light it up, we can light it up
If you got a problem, we can light it up
Light it up, we can light it up
If you got a problem, we can light it up
Light it up, we can light it up
If you got a problem, we can light it up
Light it up, we can light it up

Get high, breakin' laws
Get high, breakin' laws

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah
Okay, I wake up with the taste of pussy still in my mouth
Bitch in my bed, homegirl still asleep on the couch
My head is bangin' like Metallica, swallow a bottle of Advil up
Then head back to the bedroom where she suck me dry like
Dracula
It's The Young Miraculous Mister Love-to-Grab-His-Nuts
Never let a bitch inside, fuck her in the Acura
Aurora borealis with the shine, my aura gorgeous
Dinner with 40 courses, bunch of horny whores who fornicate
To formulate a fortune, more in the race of horses, I am
My homies got my back, they all Verizon (A-a-a-and?)
I bring this to you la-la-la-la-la-la-live, man
You gon' need at least five hands to hold my finance
I am fe, fi, fo, fum, the giant
The best thing out of Pittsburgh since Clemente with the Pirates
I tell 'em, "Shhh, this middle finger sign for silence"
Ain't a fuckin' way I'm keepin' quiet

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Juicy J]
Yeah
I been ridin' through the city, blowin' smoke out the window (Yeah)
Cops is on patrol, they lookin' out for all the crim'nals (Woo)

Rules to the game (Yeah,) you know how this shit go (Let go)
Get money, fuck the system, break the law (Break the law)
Get money, fuck the system, break the law (Hell yeah)
Get money, fuck the system, break the law (Break the law)
Oh no (Break-break, break-break the law)
La, la, la (Let's go)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller & Juicy J]
So many people told me that I wouldn't be shit, but now I walk
Around with money and my hand on my dick, I think I'm special
I'm drinkin' whiskey out the bottle 'til I black out
One million, two million, shit, I'm losin' track now
(Yeah) Comin' to you live inside the crack house
Started with a dub and then I made it to a half ounce
Then I turned it to a pound (Wow,) turned that to a house (Wow)
Turned that to a career, how the fuck did I get here? (Woo)
Spendin' all your time just gettin' high will drive you crazy
(Crazy) I killed the game like Jeffrey Dahmer did the '80s
Speedin' down the freeway gettin' head in my Mercedes
Givin' me all of this money was crazy, shoulda known better, no pressure
Dope seller, smarter than your professor
Hoes, I don't stress her, put a bitch down like Old Yeller
The flow's stellar, stella ella ola
Have you ever been? Shit, I pro'bly could've been the president

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Juicy J]
Yeah
I been ridin' through the city, blowin' smoke out the window
Cops out on patrol, they lookin' out for all the criminals
I been a lot of things, but I ain't never been a bitch though
Rules to the game, you know how this shit go
Get money, fuck the system, break the law (Break the law)
Get money, fuck the system, break the law (Hell yeah)
Get money, fuck the system, break the law (Break the law)
Oh no (Break-break, break-break the law)

From your first, your first dream that be a sinner

[Verse 3: Anderson .Paak]
Looking like you woke up, got a dreaming
Fishing where you living but there's no luck
Who can paint the picture like Dali?
Mixing different colors, what I can do

[Hook 2: Anderson .Paak]
I just want to run it on your canvas
Stroking but she pushes stroking, go nuts
Speak of me on something you can ride on
Guess how many stages, won't you open up the gates and get it

[Hook 3: Anderson .Paak]
All day, no breaks
All day, no breaks
Mix it, clip it, switch it then
Change it, no breaks
All day, no breaks

[Post Hook: Anderson .Paak]
Paint, paint
Change it
Paint, paint
Change it

[Miki Dora]
I don't know, doesn't make a difference to me
My whole life is this escape, my whole life is this way, I drop into, set the whole thing up, pull out the bottom, turn, pull up into it, and shoot for my life, going for broke, man
And behind me, all the shit goes over my back, the screaming parents, teachers, screaming teachers, police, priests, politicians, knee boarders, wind surfers
They're all going over the falls headed first into the reef, head first into the fucking reef, bwah, and I'm sure of my life
And when it starts to close out, I pull out, to the bottom out, to the back, and I pick up another one and do the same goddamn thing

[Spoken Intro]
Venice, California
Known then as "Venice: Slum by the Sea"

[Verse 1]
There's no need to wear these shades when I drive
I need to see the leap before the stride
There's so much more that can happen
I'm sure that you can imagine, I live around here
Let me show you how to walk it, stop the traffic
Them two legs will get you right for action with good brain
That get you all the answers
That get you all the cash and fashion, just bat your lashes and

[Chorus]
Tell me where you wanna go
But I don't really think that it could get much better
The city I love, city I love, city I love
You tellin' me you wanna break free, I bet you never, bet you never
Powder your nose, love
Smoke if you want to
Put your feet in the water
The city belongs to you, girl, it's all for you

[Interlude]
Tell me where you wanna go
Tell me where you wanna go (It's all for you)
Tell me where you wanna go
Tell me where you wanna go (It's all for you)

[Verse 2]
So when you're living the dream, is it hard to see?
Does your heart beat heavenly?
I think it's much more than the green leaf but it helps, of course
There's only one season
Can you believe the way that they talk about my paradise?
We don't need that kind of vibe, no, no

[Chorus]
Don't tell me where you're from, girl
Tell me where you wanna get to
The city I love, city I love, city I love
You wanna break free on me, I bet you never, bet you never
Powder your nose, love
Smoke if you want to
Put your feet in the water
The city belongs to you, girl, it's all for you
Don't tell me where you're from, girl
Tell me where you wanna get to
Put your feet in the water
The city belongs to you, girl, it's all for you

[Outro]
Tell me where you wanna go
Tell me where you wanna go (It's all for you)
Tell me where you wanna go
Tell me where you wanna go (It's all for you)

[Verse 1]
You cold, you cold, you the coldest
I just wanna know who put you on it
Homage to your teacher
Knowledge is the motherfucking key
New move, got a lot of 'em
Remember when you only knew to ride on it?
Now you be tossing it like Serena
And I'ma run it back like a re-run

[Hook]
Who put you on, who put you on to that?
You didn't know about nothing
Now you know all about nuttin'
I put you on to that
Now look at you
Who put you on to that?
You didn't know about nothing
Now you know all about nuttin'
I put you on to that

[Verse 2]
You know, you know, you my favourite
I be steady drinking with you, baby
Long strokes to the promise
Remember you couldn't take it at all?
New moves, got a lot of 'em
Tell me, when the hell you get so long winded?
Talking and walking just like a diva
Now you gon' hit them notes like Aretha

[Hook]
Who put you on, who put you on to that?
You didn't know about nothing
Now you know all about nuttin'
I put you on to that
Now look at you
Who put you on to that?
You didn't know about nothing
Now you know all about nuttin'
I put you on to that

[Outro]
Who put you on
Who put you on to that
You didn't know about nothing
Now you know all about nuttin'
I put you on to that
Now look at you
Who put you on to that
You didn't know about nothing
Now you know all about nuttin'
I put you on to that

[Skit]
Dogtown is what the kids call their hometown Venice, Venice California
It's one of the showplaces in good ol' American self-expression
Here, you do your thing and the world watches

[Verse 1]
I don't miss her one bit
Maybe a little bit
Some days, I think about it
But I get over it real quick
It's too late to make amends
We could never be friends
I don't miss her one bit
I miss that whip

[Hook]
Damn, that whip
I miss that whip
That whip, that whip, that whip
I miss that whip, look

[Verse 2]
She used to scoop me from the train station
Have a smoothie and a rented movie, pre-rolled J waitin'
(That whip, I miss that whip)
She didn't care about the reach
From the Longpre to Long Beach
(That whip, that whip, that whip, that whip
I miss that whip)

[Hook]
And damn, that whip
I miss that whip
That whip, that whip, that whip
I miss that whip

[Verse 1]
Kim plays with the heart strings
Late nights in the basement
Kills me with them soft notes
Offbeat placements
So sweet with the long notes
Blue dream and the light glow
I'll wait for the next show
But if you leave then I might roll
On your marks
When you're ready
Let me start
Okay, two shots and a slow dance
We walk to your home stand
Keep up, keep up, keep up if you can

[Pre-Hook]
Something different, ain't it?
Nothing like we planned
This ain't complicated

[Hook]
All up in the air, all up in the air
We walk in the same direction with no common plans
Guess it's just the nature of a man, prob'ly cover good, good, good
All up in the air
All up in the air
And if it's love, then it's love
But if it's not love, then it's all love
All up in the air, all up in the air
And if it's love, then it's real
But if it's not love, then it's no deal
All up in the air, all up in the air
(Get 'em up)
All up in the air
All up in the air
All up in the air
All up in the air (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Slow dance in your compound when you're off that brown
Freelance in your hometown and it's good work now
Now, set it all down
(Set it all down)
Set it all, set it all, set it all back down (Yeah)
On your marks
When you're ready
Let me start (Okay)
Smooth talkin' and they stare
How often are you here?
Keep on, keep on, keep on if you care

[Pre-Choorus]
Something different, ain't it?
Nothing like we planned
This ain't complicated

[Hook]
All up in the air, all up in the air
We walk in the same direction with no common plans
Guess it's just the nature of a man
Prob'ly cover good, good, good
All up in the air, all up in the air
And if it's love, then it's love
But if it's not love, then it's all love
All up in the air, all up in the air
And if it's love, then it's real
But if it's not love, then it's no deal
All up in the air, all up in the air
(Get 'em up)
All up in the air, all up in the air
All up in the air, all up in the air

[Verse 1]
We must've been together
I bet you knew just who I was
Somewhere around your second lifetime
We danced on Persian rugs
We fucked and fell in love tonight

[Pre Hook]
It's who we are
Too familiar, solar
Energy carried on and on and on
Ripples in the pond
Like a mirror, solar
Energy carried on and on and

[Hook]
Hey, I think I luh you (Luh you)
Fuck that, I know I do, I know I do, I know I do, I know I do
I think I luh you (Luh you)
Fuck that, I know I do, I know I do, I know I do, I know I do

[Verse 2]
Few shots, then we rid them off
Goofed off in the loft
With the Scope on, I can kill them all
We can be lovers, two souls in a different life
But you know we done here been here before
How did you know we only sip clear liquor
Smoke purple endo, top floor level
Type of shit that get
Flown 'cross the pond

[Verse 3]
I think I luh you, ooooh
We must have been together
It's somethin' like I thought it was
And what a lasting impression
You left me with an open door
I want it more and more (Yes, lawd!)

[Pre Hook]
It's who we are
Too familiar, solar
Energy carried on and on and on
Ripples in the pond
Like a mirror, solar
Energy carried on and on and

[Hook]
Hey, I think I luh you (Luh you)
Fuck that, I know I do, I know I do, I know I do, I know I do
I think I luh you (Luh you)
Fuck that, I know I do, I know I do, I know I do, I know I do

[Post Hook]
Energy carried on and on (On and on)
Energy carried on and on (On and on)
Energy carried on and on (On and on)
Energy carried on and on (On and on)

[Bridge]
Nothing that I can't quite put my finger on
Do you believe that we are star crossed?
Forgive me if I'm wrong
Forgive me if I'm wrong, spinning off
Energy carried on and on

[Outro]
Energy carried on and on
Energy carried on and on

[Verse 1]
If it's really what you needed, love
Baby, this right here's a one of one
But you can get this hit whenever you want
So here you are now
And it's on now
And it's on right now
Here you are now
And it's on now

Here we are now

And it's on

[Chorus]
Suddenly, suddenly, suddenly
Off the ground

Cooling it, cooling it, cooling it
Cool it down

[Bridge]
Send it off, send it off, in and out
Give it all, give it all, give it out
There we are, there we are, here and now
Let it all come out, let it all come out

[Verse 2]
I can move it to wherever you are
We can live this life forever more
Baby, this right here's a one on one
But you can get this **** whenever you want
So here you are now
And it's on now
And it's on right now
Here we are now
And it's on now
And it's on right now

Suddenly, suddenly, suddenly

Let it be yours, let it carry you

[Directed by Wolf Haley]

Tyler is shown in black and white sitting on a stool in an all white room. The camera shakes slightly, bringing Tyler in and out of focus.

Tyler begins to rap, miming the words as he says them. He lifts his hand up, and we see a Madagascar Cockroach climbing on his fingers. The cockroach climbs to his other hand, and Tyler stares at it intently as he raps.

It crawls over his hand, and then onto his other hand again.  Tyler brings his hand up and looks down on the cockroach, and we see the word "Kill" written in sharpie on the back of his hand. We also see an upside-down cross drawn on his middle knuckle.

The cockroach climbs to the edge of his hand and it crawls onto his other hand, and Tyler stares at the camera.

Tyler brings the hand with the cockroach down, out of the view of the camera. He brings it back up in between his fingers and puts it in his mouth.

He chews, and the camera begins panning out, bringing Tyler in and out of focus. He makes a face of disgust, and stands up from the stool, heaving.

Tyler becomes a silhouette, and he throws up onto the floor. It takes a while, and then he wipes his mouth and spits onto the floor. He sits up on the stool and he comes back into focus.

He begins rapping again, pausing to spit on the ground again. The camera slowly pans in until the upper half of his body is showing. He begins unbuttoning his shirt.

He unbuttons his shirt all the way and then his gestures become very animated. He grabs his face in rage, showing that he is wearing a chain. He then takes his shirt off  all the way.

The camera zooms in to Tyler's face, with the image becoming extremely blurry and then in sharp focus. We see that Tyler's eyes are dark black, and then we see only Tyler's teeth, then his eyes again.  Tyler gives the camera the middle finger.
Tyler begins to move around a lot, agitated, grabbing his chain. He becomes completely out of view at one point, then when he comes back into view, his nose begins to bleed. He wipes the blood off his top lip.

The camera zooms out, and a noose falls from the ceiling. Tyler grabs the noose and wraps it around his neck. He stands on the stool, and we only see his feet.

The stool falls over, and the legs begin thrashing, as Tyler hangs from the noose (out of view). His legs twitch as his legs swing back and forth.

The camera moves to see the stool on the ground and Tyler's feet dangling. The feet finally stop twitching, and they just sway around in a circle. The camera shifts in and out of focus. (Tyler is dead).

[Chorus]
Friday poppin', you already know
I'm just getting ready for
Friday poppin', you already know
It's the weekend, I'm just tryna go
All the way up, All the way up
Hit that salsa when I'm faded, When I'm faded (x4)

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Dough! We say it like, who dat?
(It's the remix!)
I hit that salsa when my pockets level
It's that action junkie
I got that salsa, she want it from me
I'm hot and spicy, I don't need no water
I hit that salsa like Victor Crew
Hit that shit like I ain't got no chips
But I do, yeah I do, 

[?] bitch for me and you
I hit that salsa when I'm faded
I hit that salsa, I got that flavor
I got that salsa like grandma made it
Locked up like I'm Gucci Mane
All I got is guacamole
This is not chipotle, this T-Raw, these bitches know me
I'm just getting ready for

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: DoZay]
All the way up, go
Tell my girl to pour that henny up
Pussy, money, dodi, I can't get enough
Haters act like bitches, I don't give a fuck
I don't give a fuck, I don't, I don't give a fuck
And that's every day
All night smoking that salsa every day
I'm about that green like I'm Cee Lo
I take a shot like a free throw
She got that 

[?] like gazebo
I drown in that pussy, el nino
Top drop, drop it to the floor for the fake

[?] call it dancing in the rain
Up down, let that cheek go for the gates
Call a stripper 

[?], put them in a range
Take another shot, Steph Curry
Turnt but I'm so faded, got my eyes so blurry
Finna get faded
Really though

[Chorus]

[Outro]
All the way up, go
Friday poppin', you already know
You ain't ready, you ain't ready though (x3)
Friday poppin', you already know
Go

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Look up look up look up
You see the last line in the air
Reach out reach out
And try to catch one if you can
Right now they're flying
Circling in coasts in the sky
When they come crashing down
It'll be the worst surprise

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
But you just stand right there
You ain't looking around
And baby you will never see it coming
A thousand kamikaze on their way down
To you but you won't ever see them
Oh no no you'll never know he's lying 'til you look up
And I'll bet you'll catch it if you'd take a second to look up
I know the truth is bounding but you gotta look up
Or you'll never see it coming
You'll never see it coming

[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Feels like I'm on the 30th floor staring out my window
And seeing them right about to crash right into you
You marching on the sidewalk umbrella up
Oblivious no clouds shades on no sun
Right now they're flying
Circling in coasts in the sky
When they come crashing down
It'll be the worst surprise

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
But you just stand right there
You ain't looking around
And baby you will never see it coming
A thousand kamikaze on their way down
To you but you won't ever see them
Oh no no you'll never know he's lying 'til you look up
And I'll bet you'll catch it if you'd take a second to look up
I know the truth is bounding but you gotta look up
Or you'll never see it coming
You'll never see it coming

[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
(Look up look up)
You better look all around
(All around)
You better
(Look up look up)
I know they're coming down
(Coming down)
They're coming down
(Look up look up)
You better look up
(Look up look up)
Crashing

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
But you just stand right there
You ain't looking around
And baby you will never see it coming
A thousand kamikaze on their way down
To you but you won't ever see them
Oh no no you'll never know he's lying 'til you look up
And I'll bet you'll catch it if you'd take a second to look up
I know the truth is bounding but you gotta look up
Or you'll never see it coming
You'll never see it coming

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
Look up look up
And maybe you'll see the lies
You'll see him fly
Look up Look up
You'll see the lies
Look up look up

[Verse 3: OG Boo Dirty]
Spend a hundred on the chopper, hundred on the bong
Hundred young nigga with a bong that's a dong
Hundred on my chain fifty on my ring
God know we with so icy gang
The bitch stand about 5'2, my money stand about 5'2
Do whatever I tell her too, might jump out the plane in a parachute
Now everybody know a real playing game
My young niggas they paru
Fuck a pig, bust at the pig, should have seen how that swine flu
Now I'm a G but who the fuck are you
Your old bitch I made her my boo
Got a bank roll that can't fold, got shooters on my payroll
It's me, Guwop, and Street Money Fresh
Every day cuttin' dope, boy fresh
1017 chain on my neck, and everywhere I go the boy stay on flex
And I got cars in my garage that I ain't even drove yet
Diamonds round my neck and my wrist that boy be frozen

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Got them bricks in the house and everybody know
Everybody know,  everybody know
Say 12 at the do', damn everybody go, everybody go

Got the powders here nigga man I got em for the low everybody know
Everybody know, everybody know
OG and Fresh serving with Guwop at yo door, everybody know, everybody know

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Gua bitch I can walk on water
Fuck yo baby momma yesterday then pay her a quarter
She said she never seen a Charger she had own Maseratis
I told her if she was my bitch id have her draped in Versace
I got a trap house mansion next to Bill Cosby
You can ask around about me they'll say i'm rock solid
And if yo body don't soft you'll make way more profit
I took a half a mill lost but it still didn't stop me and
If the cops try to stop well i'm not stopping
They call me hundred percent wock cause i'm not flopping
I had the trap fucked up cause i'm scrape dropping
And I ain't gotta say i'm back cause I stay popping

[Chorus: Jose Guapo]
Ima spend a lot a racks just for fun a day
Ima smoke a lot a blunts just for a day
I bet a 20 with the falcons and they win a day
I pulled up on him with his bitch so he ain't got nuthin to say
He ain't got nuthin to say, he ain't got shit to say
Look at his face he ain't got nuthin to say
I finest him on the play so  he ain't got nuthin to say
They know them young shooters don't play so they ain't got nuthin to say

[Verse 2: Jose Guapo]
I'm a remixing brick lunatic, hit the liquor hundred
He got money bitch they funny bitch and you go miss this money bitch
The Gucci club ain't shit to me I park my shit in front of it
Jumped out like i'm filthy rich my chick poked out like 50 cent
Talk more trash than 50 cent and get you killed for 50 cent
Why y'all niggas so devious you always get me in some shit
Mischievous for treason then might leave yo ass not breathing bitch
Clap you for no reason then the reason you ain't ask as bitch
All my guns got market drums my shit hold 200 rounds
Since you love that bitch so much I kill yo ass in front a her
Don't play me like I'm young and dumb I need  my  fucking money bruh
Cause i'm a money launderer but it turned into the pawning shop

[Chorus: Jose Guapo]
Ima spend a lot a racks just for fun a day
Ima smoke a lot a blunts just for a day
I bet a 20 with the falcons and they win a day
I pulled up on him with his bitch so he ain't got nuthin to say
He ain't got nuthin to say, he ain't got shit to say
Look at his face he ain't got nuthin to say
I finest him on the play so  he ain't got nuthin to say
They know them young shooters don't play so they ain't got nuthin to say

[Verse 3: Jose Guapo]
Ay it's young Guap bitch shout out to young Gucci
I pull up with yo bitch smoking big doobies 

[plank]

Them young niggas they wilding they pull up, they  shooting
And all ma niggas balling like they allay-hooping
Alot a shooters on the team but we still recruiting
That peanut J came in you know it came from Cali
And I spend like a 10 when I was off in Bali
And that just made me feel just like i'm was ripe for 

[?]

Pulled up on him piss him off nigga that's anyway

[Chorus: Jose Guapo]
Ima spend a lot a racks just for fun a day
Ima smoke a lot a blunts just for a day

I pulled up on him with his bitch so he ain't got nuthin to say
He ain't got nuthin to say, he ain't got shit to say
Look at his face he ain't got nuthin to say
I finest him on the play so  he ain't got nuthin to say
They know them young shooters don't play so they ain't got nuthin to say

[Intro]
Before I commit suicide, lives will be taken
Mmm, real hip-hop, west coast

[Verse 1: Kendrick]
Yo, yo
Before I commit suicide
I see to it that a million MCs die, lyrical homicide
Walk up on 'em, circle the block
Hit 'em again less than 5 minutes exact, then fleeing the spot
This is Armageddon, two weapons, two palms
Guns drawn, bang! Motherfucker, bang!
One man Vietnam
.45 popper, rhyme like the 9-5 big poppa
On a seven deck yacht, eat lobster with my comrades
Head doctor, knee pads
Gave it to her out of courtesy
Curtains close on that Maybach
Lay back as I hop on my underground shit
Like a subway, derail the track, the real is black
True rhyme sayers, hitmen, crime payers, llama throwers
Hustle in front of corner stores
Street catered, for been living on minimum wages
It's not a threat, I'm doing myself a favor
With suicide

[Hook]
Before I commit suicide
Before I commit suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
I got my mind on the murder and the murder on my mind

[Verse 2: Kendrick]
You a liar, you and I are not alike
I flow like water, purify mics
Ask Sean Carter, Nasir Jones
Or anyone sitting on the throne
Don't get your career postponed
Women, children, I rode past in traffic
Can't steer, cars crash
I got a death wish, you might be on my guest list
I wrap rappers on stretchers
Guns clap in the direction your sepsis
No matter your gender, not sexist
You MC? You better surrender
I love breakfast, lunch and dinner
Killing these rappers
Sparring in the winter, training in the summer
More practice, let's continue
Doing numbers like an accountant
You wonder like knife, how much money I'm counting
You're damn right, I spit it pretty precise
And whenever the verse is done, means I took me another life

[Hook]
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide

[Bridge]
(Oh, you motherfuckers think I'm playing, huh? Let me hop on my Daddy Kane shit, jump on my shit, 'Naw mean?)

[Verse 3: Kendrick]
I delete MCs under concrete
Verbal mass destruction, you want it? Then call me
A killer, I put these rappers on their death bed
One shot to the heart, one more to the head
My rhymes so clever I never fall off
From an industry nigga, they all get hauled off
But not from a sawed-off, but more like an uzi
Spit rap, and these succulent MCs get chewed, B
Money, power, respect, pussy and pistols
Hoes pop pills like it's a modern day ritual
But I don't sweat 'em y'all, I just behead 'em y'all
And leave the party jumping like players of B-ball
The B-board, those will die who decoy
Destroy any rapper thinking he make noise
It's K-Dot, the terminator
Fake rapper rhyme slayer
Those who live now will die later

[Outro]
The suicide

[Verse 1]
You tell me it gets better, it gets better in time
You say I'll pull myself together, pull it together, you'll be fine
Tell me, what the hell do you know? What do you know?
Tell me how the hell could you know? How could you know?

[Chorus 1]
'Til It happens to you, you don't know how it feels, how it feels
'Til it happens to you, you won't know, it won't be real
No, it won't be real, won't know how it feels

[Verse 2]
You tell me hold your head up, hold your head up and be strong
'Cause when you fall you gotta get up, you gotta get up and move on
Tell me how the hell could you talk, how could you talk?
'Cause until you walk where I walk, this is no joke

[Chorus 2]
'Til it happens to you, you don't know how it feels, how it feels
'Til it happens to you, you won't know, it won't be real
(How could you know?)
No it won't be real
(How could you know?)
Won't know how I feel

[Bridge]
'Til your world burns and crashes
'Til you're at the end, the end of your rope
'Til you're standing in my shoes
I don't wanna hear a thing from you, from you, from you
'Cause you don't know

[Chorus 3]
'Til it happens to you, you don't know how I feel, how I feel
How I feel
'Til it happens to you, you won't know, it won't be real
(How could you know?)
No it won't be real
(How could you know?)
Won't know how it feels

[Outro]
'Til it happens to you
Happens to you
Happens to you
Happens to you
Happens to you
Happens to you
(How could you know?)
'Til it happens you
You won't know how I feel

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Let me brush my shoulders off
Shiny patent leather Pradas looking like a bowling ball
Diamonds on my neck and wrist haters like he showing off
Cause I be shitting on these nigga all around and overall
Back up on my old shit bout to make it cold for y'all
I scoop your bitch up and her friend like I just want fuck both of y'all
Kilo fresh how you want it sofa soft
Cause I get it to you fast hold up let me phone a call
Meek Milly with the dealy how you feelin
I say I feel like a million when I step up in the building
My neck tell you that I'm chilling my wrist say that I'm ok
I be stunting when I come in I don't dance no not way
I say we bottle pop hurricane that Chris like hey bae bae
Let the models watch we fuck with that white like KKK
Steal your bitch right in your face and then like Mike I fade away
So tell them lames stay out my way before I fuck up their whole day
Mind in my business getting mine is my business
I get way more off of rapping than you making off of trapping
First I come home I was rapping then I signed for thirty stacks
And all this funny shit I'm hearing got me dying from the laughter

[Verse 2: Oschino]
They hate to see me eating right cause they fucking pockets low
White Benz black rims shit look like a domino
Riding slow bucket low ya you see me blingin' hard
Cleaner than a boarded house diamonds like a deck of cards
Searching shit like wrecking balls when we step up in the place
Lot of money lot of mace lot of chicken lot of cakes
We balling at the bar, we at the bar 'til it's out of drinks
No we ain't got no job ya but we got that white
What you think what we do, birds not the 

[?]
Murder who murder you the mac keep shells like a turtle do
Niggas mad cause I'm eating niggas mad cause I'm eating
What they make in one year nigga make in one weekend
Fucking with the Puertoricans
Julio, Javier, to get me mean fish, mean fish shit that piranhas fear
Why you think my diamonds here
Getting money my career
Nigga pop fly, wet that nigga like he diving gear

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
It's big business, big bills, and big choppers
Cherry red Challenger looking like a lobster
All black D's on it hoes holler
Sliding through your area why is they comparing us
I'm serious, number on my check look like a serial
And I still got the block jumping Shawn Marion
I see a hater disrespect me then I'm airing them
He don't dig me where I'm coming from we just bury him
We count money fuck bitches go super hard
Laid back Maybach looking like a superstar
Diamonds on my neck shining like a shooting star
Thirty in my clip it got me feeling like a shooting guard
Stop me, small but I'm cocky
Two fourties give a nigga eighty like Shockey
Pull up in the hood four door Maserati
Jewels on flashy like a paparazzi copy
I be probably in the hills out in Cali
In a million dollar crib eating on strip and broccoli
Watch me, Philadel Flyer no hockey
Tell your chick to google me she can dot com
She ain't got to chase me just tell her Myspace me
And maybe she can find me so I can get behind it
Told her I got a deal so now she drove me like sloppy
Got the goons on deck they ride hard like Kawasaki
Swag so sick my money is the medicine
Stunting on you rookie ass niggas like a veteran
Still do my thing while I'm watching for the letter man
Had to kick the door down them pussies wouldn't let me in
I here now I said I'm here now
Had to kick the door down them pussies wouldn't let me in
Meek Milly nigga what what
I'm getting money like a mother fucker
Windows darker than the bitch but I can see
I got everything you got nothing that's why your bitch be all over me

[Verse 1]
In your bed, or in your car
On the earth, or up in the stars
I wanna be where you are
Even if that means going too far
At your place, or up in space
You can, you can meet me out, as long as I see your face
I wanna be, where you are
Even if that means, letting go of my heart
You take me higher than I’ve been before
Don’t laugh when I say that, 'cause we just smoked a bowl
And I, I have a hard time, anyway, saying how I feel
But I’m a little buzzed, so I’m keeping it real
And I tried to take it slow, but
When you're 'round me, my pot’s about to blow
And everything you do just turns me on
So let’s go to my room, and "na-na"

[Chorus 1]
Shit's 'bout to get real freaky, I can feel it
I hope you're ready, I'm into whatever
Shit's 'bout to get real freaky, I can feel it
Don't you worry, we won't regret it

[Verse 2]
It's never felt right to be so wrong
I should've called you sooner, you loved me for so long
And it's been a while since I've been with someone else
'Cause I got too good at just doing it myself
At your dad’s place, or at your moms
And if they’re both home, we can go out on the lawn
And I wanna walk around while wearing high heels
After we drank all night, and we done a bunch of pills
And then...

[Bridge]

Don't you worry, you won't regret it, and...

Why you throwing shade at me hater I could take a bitch

[Verse 2: Oschino]
How you like me now bitch kerosene heater hot
Two seater drop, icey icey as a freeze pop
Call me now, need notm I'm out Vegas shooting dice
MGM Grand front row prize fight
Party like a rockstar, sexy in my fur coat
Ya I got the guap fucking the bread like burnt toast
Now you want some money from me
You can't get nothing from me
You call me bummy ugly
Shitting on you like a hugging
Now you see me blowing like a pipe bomb hoe
Know you want to come and kick it tae-kwan-doe no

[?] leave alone, screaming through my speaker phone
Inviting me to dinner ya right you better eat alone
Stuntin' like a stunt man ya boy ain't got to worry
His bank account stuffed like Thanksgiving turkey
Can't talk I'm in  a hurry my pl-plane gon' depart
I'm a push push driver you a bus like Rosa Parks

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Ya I was fucked up but bitch I'm back

[Verse]
Grand Hustle ya that's my clique
Omelly ya that's my goon
All I got to do is point and watch him pop you like balloon
Shout out my nigga Meech, Pmon that's my dawg too
I be fucking bitches and it's like he fuck 'em all too
We ball through, she call me I hang up she call you
He look at me smiling and I be like she wilding
We styling SRT, Cherokee be growling
Me I wear that wrist shot like I signed a deal with Prada
My motto MOB I been about a dollar
I'm bound to cop Maserati you 'bout to go Marauder
You nigga fucking with the wrong one
Short temper long gun, I do this for the long run
If I don't have a million by the type I'm twenty-five
I swear to God I ain't rapping I'm in the hood trapping
Trying to knock down bricks like the big bad wolf
Tell my lawyer get me home this jail shit a bad look
Hit her with a couple stacks and next week I had court
Now I'm back and I"m a problem like fuck a mad book
Streets respect it and in the jails I'm well know
Eating the cheche talking to T.I.P on the cellphone
Land up in the bed money and bitches to dwell on
Let's powerhouse man  hurry up get the hell home
A mac like Charlie, make noise like a Harley
Ride hard Ferarri, puffing that Bob Marley
Knocking these rappers out the way like sorry
Young nigga but I've been had game like Atari
Killers on the left of me, gonnies to the right of me
Haters even liking me they say I'm too nice to be
Hated on I stayed upon the realest and the trillest
Brick of cocaine will turn your neighborhood to Thriller
I ain't gon' lie dawg I ain't never been a killer
I always had heart that was from the start
Forty on me always kept it on everywhere I walk
So anywhere it went down I was riding Rosa Parks
Take one breath, one fundamental sign of life
Don't look back, don't analyze the tears you cry

Only the strong survive the silent sacrifice
And I, I will be your heart of steel but power has a price
Ain't it time that you believe in someone
Ain't it wrong to let the years go by
Standing face to face forever live or die

Hold me like a child, I'm not alive until you do
What you hold in your hand is a miracle
And it's dead if I don't have you

Hold me like a child, and swear you never let me go
You're the eye of the storm, the reason I laugh or cry
Live or die, I will stay with you

Take one breath, one fundamental sign of life
No bad blood, no pain can make you draw the knife

Ah, We got a world of trouble but I will never change
And even if we fall tomorrow, we will rise again
Now is the time we show each other, these are the words I kept inside
Standing face to face forever live of die
Hold me like a child, I'm not alive until you do
What you hold in your hand is a miracle
And it's dead if I don't have you

Hold me like a child and swear you never let me go
You're the eye of the storm, the reason I laugh or cry
Live or die, I will stay with you
Live or die, I will stay with you

Take one breath, one fundamental sign of life
Don't look back, we love each other live or die

Hold me like a child, I'm not alive until you do
Live or die, I will stay with you

Take one breath, one fundamental sign of life
Don't look back, we love each other live or die

Hold me like a child
Take one breath, one fundamental sign of life
Don't look back, we love each other live or die

Hold me like a child
Take one breath, one fundamental sign of life
Don't look back, we love each other live or die
Hold me like a child
Take one breath, one fundamental sign of life
Don't look back, we love each other live or die

[Verse 1]
You are what you are
I don't matter to anyone
But Hollywood legends
Will never grow old
And though our love was hidden
Well, it will never grow cold

[Chorus]
But I lost myself when I lost you
But I still got jazz when I've got those blues
And I lost myself when I lost you
And I still get trashed, darling, when I hear your tunes

[Verse 2]
But you are who you are
I won't change you for anything
For when you are crazy
I'll let you be bad
I'll never dare change thee
To what you are not

[Chorus]
But I lost myself when I lost you
But I still got jazz when I've got those blues
I lost myself and I lost you too
And I still get trashed, baby, when I hear your tunes

[Bridge]
I put the radio on, hold you tight in my mind
Isn’t strange that you’re not here with me
I’m putting all the lights on and the television
Trying to transmit, can you hear me?
Ground control to Major Tom
Can you hear me all night long?
Ground control to Major Tom

[Chorus]
Well, I lost myself when I lost you
But I still got jazz when I've got the blues
I lost myself and I lost you too
And I still get trashed, honey, when I hear your tunes

[Outro]
Mmmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Mmmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Mmmm
Mmmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Mmmm

[Verse 1]
Club queen on the downtown scene
Prowling around at night
You're not mean, you're just born to be seen
Born to be wild
A little party never hurt no one, that's why it's alright
You want in but you just can't win
So you hang in the lights

[Chorus]
You're so Art Deco out on the floor
Shining like gunmetal, cold and unsure
Baby, you're so ghetto, you're looking to score
When they all say hello, you try to ignore them

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause you want more (Why?)
You want more (Why?)
You want more (Why?)
'Cause you want more

[Verse 2]
Young thing on the downtown scene
Rolling around at night
Got things that have yet to be seen
Like your rapper's delight
A little party never hurt no one, that's why it's alright
You want in, but you just can't win
So you stay in the lights

[Chorus]
You're so Art Deco out on the floor
Shining like gunmetal, cold and unsure
Baby, you're so ghetto, you're looking to score
When they all say hello, you try to ignore them

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause you want more (Why?)
You want more (Why?)
You want more (Why?)
'Cause you want more

[Bridge]
A little party never hurt no one
So you stay out late
A little party never hurt no one
That's what your friends say
You put your life out on the line
You're crazy all the time
Put your life out on the line
You're crazy all the time

[Chorus]
You're so Art Deco out on the floor
Shining like gunmetal, cold and unsure
Baby, you're so ghetto, you're looking to score
When they all say hello, you try to ignore them

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause you want more (Why?)
You want more (Why?)
You want more (Why?)
'Cause you want more

[Outro]
A little party never hurt no one
Not you and me
A little party never hurt no one
We were born to be free

[Intro]
Hmmm-mm
Hmmm-mm

[Verse 1]
Sometimes, I wake up in the morning
To red, blue, and yellow skies
It's so crazy, I could drink it like tequila sunrise

[Pre-Chorus]
Put on that Hotel California
Dance around like I'm insane
I feel free when I see no one
And nobody knows my name

[Chorus]
God knows I lived, God knows I died
God knows I begged
Begged, borrowed, and cried
God knows I loved, God knows I lied
God knows I lost, God gave me life
And God knows I tried
God knows I tried, God knows I tried, God knows I tried

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I wake up in the morning
To red, blue, and yellow lights
On Monday they destroy me
But by Friday I'm revived

[Pre-Chorus]
Put on that Hotel California
Wear my blinders in the rain
I've got nothing much to live for
Ever since I found my fame

[Chorus]
God knows I lived, God knows I died
God knows I loved, God knows I lied
God knows I begged
Begged, borrowed, and cried
God knows I lost, God gave me life
And God knows I tried
God knows I tried, God knows I tried, God knows I tried

[Bridge]
So let there be light
Let there be light
Light up my life, light up my life
Let there be light, let there be light
Light up my life, light up my life

[Outro]
And God knows I tried, God knows I tried
God knows I tried, God knows I tried
God knows I tried, God knows I tried
God knows I tried, God knows I tried

[Verse 1]
Flames so hot that they turn blue
Palms reflecting in your eyes like an endless summer
That's the way I feel for you
If time stood still, I'd take this moment, make it last forever

[Pre-Chorus]
Your halo's full of fire
I'm rising up, rising up
My hot love's full of fire
Love's full of fire
La, ah

[Chorus]
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too

[Verse 2]
Leather black and eyes of blue (blue, blue, blue)
Sun reflecting in your eyes like an easy rider
Life makes sense when I'm with you
Looking back, my past
It all seems stranger than a stranger

[Pre-Chorus]
So let's dance in slow motion
Tear it up, tear it up
And let's dance by the ocean
Ah, ah

[Chorus]
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too

[Bridge]
Ooh-ooh
You're cold as ice, baby
But when you're nice, baby
You're so amazing in every way
Ooh-ooh
You're cold as ice, baby
I don't wanna fight, baby
It's like I told you
If you stay, I'll stay (yeah)

[Chorus]
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
(Take it to the back if you really wanna talk)
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
(Take it to the back if you really wanna talk)
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too

[Outro]
Hmmm-hmmm-mmmm
Hmmm-hmmm-mmmm

[Verse 1]
There's only 24 hours in a day
And half as many ways for you to lie to me, my little love
There's only 24 hours in a day
And half of those, you lay awake
With thoughts of murder and carnage

[Pre-Chorus]
If you lie down with dogs, then you'll get fleas
Be careful of the company you keep

[Chorus]
There's only 24 hours
And that's not enough
To lie like you lie
Or love like you love

[Post-Chorus]
Hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm

[Verse 2]
There's only 24 hours in a day
And half of those you lay
Between the sheets with me, my lying love
There's only 24 hours, so you'd say
For most of them you pay
For all the things they paid you for, my love

[Pre-Chorus]
If you lie down with dogs, then you'll get fleas
Be careful of the ones you choose to leave

[Chorus]
There's only 24 hours
And that's not enough
To lie like you lie
Or love like you love

[Post-Chorus]
Hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm

[Bridge]
Give me your heat
Give me your diamonds
You hit that street
And my crooked words
You count to three
While they're all dying
You're hard to reach
You're cold to touch

[Outro]
La-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-di-da-da-da

[Interlude]
Time present and time past
Are both perhaps present in time future
And time future contained in time past
If all time is eternally present
All time is unredeemable
What might have been is an abstraction
Remaining a perpetual possibility
Only in a world of speculation
What might have been and what has been
Point to one end, which is always present
Footfalls echo in the memory
Down the passage which we did not take
Towards the door we never opened
Into the rose-garden

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Listen I'mma ball 'til I fall
Spit it like I did it
Ride 'til I die with my finger on the trigger
I ain't never had nothing
I'mma get it how I'm living
Crackers want to sit me down cause I'm a stand up nigga

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I be on the block with tre pound glockin' it
Bound to shot all in a nigga face like Schostakovich
Got your main bitch all on my dick and she be riding it
She tell me that your fuck game suspect tried of it
I don't even let her suck me off I let her polish it
She be lollipopping it, head shot bobbing it
But back to these dirty streets where niggas on some rotting shit
Gorillas with banana clips you don't want to collide with
If a nigga got beef tell him don't go rap about it
Tell him meet me in the streets cause he know that's where I'm at
Seven days up out of the week
24 hours a day I'm in the trap I'm never sleep
I'm a east sider rider Realadel solider
Told ya niggas out my range like rover
Hold up grind like brakes with no rotors
Big boy shit wake a nigga up Folgers
My team pro-methazine soda
We ball sip lean ride roller
We all got green got yolla
Got purple by the pound haze fluffy like your sofa
That's how we move it, like it ain't nothing to it
Get the work bust it down and run right through it
Some say I spit retardo like I'm stupid
If it's 'bout a check we Nike just do it

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I'mma ball 'til I fall
Spit it like I did it
Ride 'til I die with my finger on the trigger
I ain't never had nothing
I'mma get it how I'm living
Crackers want to sit me down cause I'm a stand up nigga

[Verse 2: Nitty]
The name Nitty yo
Talk of the city yo
I get busy not afraid to let that semi go
I be in the lime light it look like a video
Never been a underdog stay on top with any flow
A million or more my shit popping out the store
If I hit her one time bet she call me back for more
I'm trying to make a million off a dollar
Gridning off the steps couldn't do it had to holler
Trapping with an attitude nothing like my father
Still on my Jay-O never man I can't let a day go
Now, let's get to work and they we drop it like a KO
Ask them little niggas they say I'm hotter than Waco
Texas mac spill elastic when I stretch shit
Richie on his way home and he can't wait to wet shit
Back to back vans different bitches on some neck shit
Black on black Vans laces loose fresh shit

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I'mma ball 'til I fall
Spit it like I did it
Ride 'til I die with my finger on the trigger
I ain't never had nothing
I'mma get it how I'm living
Crackers want to sit me down cause I'm a stand up nigga

[Verse 3: Black Dinero]
Who got the game on smash? who got the game on lock?
You ain't on the game on nothing you just run that game a lot
I keep that caine in pot I keep that gun on hip
Better keep your distance nigga when I lift better pray I miss
I'm 'bout that dollar dollar, that Louis Gucci and Prada
That's part of my attire I spit that rapid fire
I set that stove on fire I drop that baking water
I got some nice ass prices come on now place your order
You know I'm 'bout my change, you know I hold them things
I throw that work around that change come back like boomerangs
Roll with orangutans they flipping bust that heat
I know the feds is watching hommie I'm in these streets
Bust guns inhale the smoke bust guns if I go broke
Sometimes I bust my guns for nothing just to let you know
Grown man with too much pride I let them bullets fly
And I ain't fighting the only thing I fight is homicide

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I'mma ball 'til I fall
Spit it like I did it
Ride 'til I die with my finger on the trigger
I ain't never had nothing
I'mma get it how I'm living
Crackers want to sit me down cause I'm a stand up nigga

[Intro]

[Verse 2]

Flexin with your shooters but your nigga don't terror me
Your niggas ain't terror squad, here go some clarity
You know I'm the best, you scared of success, you should be scared of me
Just blew a bag at the mall, that's therapy
Just gave some swag to you dog, that's charity

[Refrain]
It's time for some clarity, lookin' for clarity
Look at me, dog, my diamonds got clarity

[Hook]

Everybody's laughing in my mind

Do you do what you did when you did with me?
Does he love you the way I can?
Did you forget all the plans that you made with me?
'Cause, baby, I didn't

[Chorus: Justin Bieber, (Rascal Flatts), Both]
That should be me holding your hand
That should be me making you laugh (Yeah)
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me (Ooh oh)
That should be me feeling your kiss (Feeling your kiss)
That should be me buying you gifts  (Buying you gifts)
This is so wrong
I can't go on (I can't go on)
'Til you believe

That should be me (No, oh-oh, ooh)

[Verse 2: Rascal Flatts, Justin Bieber, Both]
You said you needed a little time for my mistakes
It's funny how you used that time to have me replaced
Did you think that I wouldn't see you out at the movies?
What you doing to me?
You're taking him where we used to go
Now if you're tryna break my heart
It's working 'cause you know that...

[Chorus: Justin Bieber, (Rascal Flatts), Both]
That should be me holding your hand (holding your hand)
That should be me making you laugh (Oh)

Don't let your guard down, hold your head up
Life comes at you fast, gotta stay strong

[Verse 1]
Yeah, this is not for Katy Perry fans
This the type of shit your parents ban

Chain smokin' give you second hand
At the top, how's the weather man?
Miami hoes with excessive tans
She bought a booty with a credit scam
So she fit those leggings real aggressive man
This is not for show
And this is not for gimmick
Niggas counterfeiting flows that I invented
Hella epic fails, it's a epidemic
Crop 'em out the picture
I'm so photogenic (cheese)
Fill my pockets with it
Get your check-up nigga like a doctor visit
Big booty Egyptian hoes, textin' me in hieroglyphic
Where's my etiquette, girl let me pour you a beverage (what)
What is your preference (Bobby!), she like it straight with no extra shit
She just wanna party

If she feelin froggy jump it off for the homie

[Verse 2]
Turn another corner engine roarin'
Since it's foreign Imma need a translator
Just to see how fast it's going
Pull up to the valet with a Berry Halle
And she from the valley smokin' on that Cali
Keep the liquor pourin'
Pourin', pourin', keep the liquor pourin'
Niggas try to knock me 'til I bring it to the door and
Should I get a flight and get the seat before its boardin'
From the Jump Man like Jordan
Thumbin' through it I got Carpal Tunnel
So much tree that I could start a jungle
So much pussy it be hard to juggle
She got a light skin friend look like Michael Jackson
She gotta dark skin friend look like Carlton Mama
What's a party without Bob
Flash mob ho that's bitches without bras
Ghost ride the whip, that's niggas without cars
Ghost writing lyrics that's niggas behind bars
Whole lotta haters and a whole lotta commas
Whole lotta commas and a lot more comin'
Whole lotta bandz that's a whole lotta drummin'
With my nigga London fuckin' hoes out in London like (sheesh)
She just wanna party and I told her if she

[Verse 1: Gillie Da Kid]
See its nothing I fear, run and tell 'em that
Philly's in here no you go tell 'em Gillie's in here
I don't bust up in the air hear the cops come
Hell if I care I'mma throw a couple in ya hair
Let's the bullets just tear
Doctors got to try to fucking repair
Brain fragments now you in that wheelchair
The new Guccis they be twelve hundred a pair
That's 600 a sneaker but it's free for you to stare
Diamonds glare off that boy spent a hundred that's the player rate
What I dropped on jewelry that's the salary the mayor make
Show you how to bake a cake
Get it in soft cook it up to hard
Take it to the plate chop it down
Move it to the block get it off
Can't accumulate the drama we getting all the money we be seeing
Benz's BM's balling so hard we should be on ESPN
I ain't with that he say hommie
And you know how we play hommie
Big ice only me diamond cuts I love is the DJ hommie

[Verse 2: Bump J]
This ain't fear run tell 'em that the figures in here
Know it's Bump when you see that nine mill
Hell ya it's my year I'm about to eat it up
Beat it up you see it what
Hold up hold up Bump speed it up
Got the game in a hold and I can't let go
Don't know better ask about me
See you niggas get mad but the money in the bag got dragged
You see it's steady piling
Green, green, Benny, Benny
Hit a nigga back with the semi
And he got another in the k
If you owe hey you better come gimme gimme
Trust that when we roll out know this
Goon on the side he hold it focused
Focused in the club we smoking
Smoking better not provoke us
Up the chain before you see that flame
Might have him on the block boy all in pain
Quit playing 'bout all them games
Leave shawty wet life falling rain
Better know when I press that thing I'm accurate you could trust this aim
That fact is that I'm laughing at you through the scope if you think you could get out this frame
Still get it on the block that change
Since the rims and drop done change
B thought he, he, he, you dudes just not the same

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
A millionaire in my bag that was just my first gear

[Verse 1]
Been that man since Batman had a sidekick
Robin, and I'm giving to the poor Mike Tyson
Don't drink extavia bitch I put rice in
Here bitch, ziploc bag filled with my dick
Give it to your parents and tell them that it's a nice gift
Of my semen, futures as I'm a psychic
Do you wanna ride? Because I don't know where my bike is
I've lost my mind
Can somebody page Amanda Bynes and maybe she can help me find it?
Pink and blue all on my neck, fuck I'm blinded
I'm a nigga bitch, bring that pink pale pussy here and take some nigga dick
Spitting, get it cracking like some nigga lips
Bad to the bone, I don't know where my appendix is
I'm kidding it's right here
In the pocket of them pants covered in white smears
Engine to my left, Clipse plays in my right ear
When I steer that third gear, people fear when I drive here
I'm fast motherfucker in a whole other lightyear, what's up?

[Outro]
Yo, that flow is sick

Boy, I'm - I'm on your runway
And I don't never wanna come back
Put my name on your T-shirt

[?] love
Put me on your map

....

[Verse 1]
This ain't appropriate now
Push my hand off your side
There’s no one else around
I just wanna tease your eyes
Maybe we can check these locks
I just wanna go inside
Why's it so dead on a Friday night?
I guess the morning’s here if you wake by five

[Hook]
You send my life
Into somewhere I can’t describe
So many details
What had happened to the time we had?
I thought you said you won't ever
(I know I promised to wait)
Won't ever leave me
What happened to us?
(I really did try)

[Verse 2]
OK, I’ll take you back
Alright, let’s pick up where we started
Don’t think that’s in my head
I’m not a bit cold hearted
Save yourself tonight
Tomorrow I'll get you back
I don't think I have your problem
I don't think I have your problem
I don't think I have a problem
I don't think I mean to fuss
I don't want to bother you
And there is no reason to rush

[Hook]
You send my life
Into somewhere I can’t describe
So many details
What had happened to a time we had
I thought you said you won't ever
Won't ever leave me
What happened to us

[Verse 3: Hodgy Beats]
I'm wearing flip-flops to the beach to put my feet in sand
And I'm bringing sin 

[?]
Fly, never die, Peter Pan 

[?]
I can, I can be your man
If you can, cooking pans, no crooked lands 

[?]
Or you can move it on in with friends
They say relationships make you sick
So why should I even take the risk
Of dating a bitch if she ain't legit
I'm looking for support
Cutting myself short, when the ball's in the court
Sounds begin to distort
Can't hear me when I clarify, until I disappear in skies
Tell me you miss a nigga while he's on tour
Girl I think you are just bored
Go out and go get yours
You're jealous of my success
Confess it, it's coming out your pores
Once you open up and express feelings, now you're closing doors
Mainly when they automatic
What happened to passion?
Hugs and compassion, me rubbing your ass and us laughin
Using no Magnums, love's an assassin
Screwed the caption
I should've wrapped it up before I finished rapping

[Hook: Toro Y Moi]
You send my life, into somewhere
I can’t describe, so many details

[x3]

Yes, that is what disturbs me

He'd probably get indigestion

Take them)

This jungle is dangerous Trapper
You will need assistance

You risked your life for us, thanks

I lost an arm

Return to the house)
No

What the?
Now Trapper, perhaps you will listen

How could you have done that to us?

You are in the music
In the man's car next to me
Somewhere in my sadness
I know I won't fall apart completely

Girl you are rich even with nothing
And you know tenderness comes from pain
It's amazing how you love
And love is kind and love can give and get no gain

[Chorus]
It's down a rugged road you've come
Though you had every reason
You didn't come undone
Somehow you made it to the other side
You didn't suffer in vain

You forgive those who have trespassed against you
And you know tenderness comes from pain
It's amazing how you love
And love is kind and love can give and love needs no gain

Though you had every reason
You didn't come undone
Somehow you made it to the other side
You didn't suffer in vain

Only love, it's only love
It's only love that gets you through

Machine guns (for they know not)
Bullets flying (what they do)
Machine gun, bullets flying (blessed are)
Children scream (the pure in heart)
(For they) The fellas run (shall see God)
Mothers mourn (blessed are, the meek)

Carry my body (Lord, have mercy, forgive them), machine gun

Jimi Hendrix would say
Machine gun, don't you shoot me
Don't you shoot me, don't you shoot me
Don't you shoot me, don't you shoot me

[Verse 1]
Her voice embedded in my head and the bezel of my heart
It's spelling her name and it's tearing me
'Cause I can't get her in my hands to put her on my arm
These expensive things are just wearing me
'Cause nothing even matters if her sun shines
Trapped in behind the clouds most of the time
I finally see why they guard her soul 'cause she's priceless
But there's something that she ought to know, so

[Pre-Chorus]
She got me picking up rocks, tossing them at her window
Baby, come outside
I gave it two or three knocks, standing at the front door
'Cause I done ran out of rocks
Oh, I gotta get up and let her know she's perfect in ways
She couldn't think of and I think about her every day
This might not be love but this crush
Got me wanting to tell you today

[Chorus]
You're a diamond in the rough, dust you off, baby
I wanna make you shine for me
And if I can take you out, I'll show you off, baby
I want the whole world to see
Your future looks so blind 'cause they say I'm a star
But you carry your own light, shed some light on my heart
You're a diamond in the rough
I wanna make you shine for me, shine for me, shine for me

[Verse 2]
Now this, might be the only time to say it
We're finally face-to-face and maybe, huh
You're probably scared to be put out on display
To be part of a showcase
But if I could paint a picture, you'd be my Mona Lisa
Baby, you're a work of art
And just when I thought I had her, baby girl, picked her bag up
Told me watch out, then she ran back into the house now

[Pre-Chorus]
She got me picking up rocks, tossing them at her window
Baby, come outside
I gave it two or three knocks, standing at the front door
'Cause I done ran out of rocks
Oh, I gotta get up and let her know she's perfect in ways
She couldn't think of and I think about her every day
This might not be love but this crush
Got me wanting to tell you today

[Chorus]
You're a diamond in the rough, dust you off, baby
I wanna make you shine for me
And if I can take you out, I'll show you off, baby
I want the whole world to see
Your future looks so blind 'cause they say I'm a star
But you can carry your own light, shed some light on my heart
You're a diamond in the rough
I wanna make you shine for me, shine for me, shine for me

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
You're a diamond in the rough, dust you off, baby
I wanna make you shine for me
And if I can take you out, I'll show you off, baby
I want the whole world to see
Your future looks so blind 'cause they say I'm a star
But you can carry your own light, shed some light on my heart
You're a diamond in the rough
I wanna make you shine for me, shine for me, shine for me

[Hook]
Rap star, need fast cars, cash in large amounts
I need a bitch with an ass that bounce
A fat ass and titties that bounce
You know I'm in the street when the city come out
When the city dumb out
When you envision me
(Can you tell me) am I getting it though?

[Verse 1]
I'm a rap star, call the task force
I make your club collapse
After I leave with the bad ones
Presidential suite with the bad ones
Told my niggas ya'll can have them
Cause I have one, I'm on FaceTime with her
When she blowing you kisses, saying she miss ya
Could have anyone she want, she just wanna be with ya
I'm a rap star, I just wanna get richer
You might slip when I talk, you know I'm slick when I talk
Rap star, got plaques on my wall
That's art and facts on my wall
Crib I bought got two gates for security guards - it's a palace dog!
I remember when I have it dog
And back then I was still saying I'ma have it dog!

[Hook]
I'm a rap star, need fast cars, cash in large amounts
I need a bitch with an ass that bounce
A fat ass and titties that bounce
You know I'm in the street when the city come out
When the city dumb out
When you envision me
(Can you tell me) am I getting it though?

[Verse 2]
I'm a rap star, can you imagine?
Putting chains on ya man's neck, cause the muscle stronger the fan flexin'
Dealing with gossip, hate and threats
When they bettin' against you and you raise the bet
Yeah, you got 'em there nigga, you got 'em scared
They not prepared, you got 'em right where you want 'em, right there
I'm a rap star and your nightmare
Used to slapbox, now we don't fight fair
Life ain't, so I ain't
This about my team, cause they ate when I ate
Yeah they steak like my steak
Handle they beef like it's on my plate
I'm a rap star that graaa, graaa, graaa
That "move, let 'em through, get back"

(Could you imagine?)

[Hook]
I'm a rap star, need fast cars, cash in large amounts
I need a bitch with an ass that bounce
A fat ass and titties that bounce
You know I'm in the street when the city come out
When the city dumb out
When you envision me
(Can you tell me) am I getting it though?

[Intro]
Everyone mind stuck on druggin' now

[Verse]
I figured I just switch on all of my other styles
Stopped smokin blunts, I can run a mile
I can't go out cause they gun me down
I'm coming up from the under
Know you'll hear that thumping sound
No peace in your stomping ground
Booming like a thunder cloud
Chicken with no head, how you run it now
Shit can get ugly
If I'm takin' shots then I'mma get the bucket
Don't you run up on me while I'm out in public
I got two hands and I trust 'em
One fits perfect in a running mouth
Be a slow learner when it's turning down time
I went cold turkey, now it's back to
Slow burning herbo when I get some down time
Only difference is, from the last time, bitch I'm outside

[Hook]
It's toasty again
'nother homi, another soul in the wind
'nother body gettin' poked with a stick
I be outside, aye
It's toasty again
'nother body rotten', poked with sticks
'nother homi, another soul in the wind
I be outside, I be outside
It's toasty again
'nother homI, another soul in the wind
'nother body gettin' poked with a stick
I be outside, aye
I be outside, aye

[Verse 1]
Now it's getting quiet here, now it's getting blue
And this, baby, ain't no fair, taking up my youth
You've been telling me some lies, I be thinking it's the truth
But I see it in your eyes, the things that you do

[Refrain]
I don't wanna waste no time all alone
Want somewhere to go, something to call my own
And I ain't satisfied, where to go?
Lost out on the road, washed up on the shore

[Pre-Chorus]
And I've been through mountains and seas
Tryna get you to come back to me
And I've been far, and I've been so deep
Now I find it harder and harder to breathe

[Chorus]
And I need some new love
New love, new love

[Verse 2]
Even though I've run away, I still come back
No, there's nothing more to say, it's all been said
I've been trying to explain the things we had
To all of my friends who say that I've gone mad

[Refrain]
I don't wanna waste no time all alone
Want somewhere to go, something to call my own
And I ain't satisfied, where to go?
Lost out on the road, washed up on the shore

[Pre-Chorus]
And I've been through mountains and seas
Tryna get you to come back to me
And I've been far, and I've been so deep
Now I find it harder and harder to breathe

[Chorus]
And I need some new love
New love, new love
And I need some new love
New love, new love

[Bridge]
Easy come, easy go
Why are we living on, living on?
If we're not getting on, getting on?
Can we just let it go?
Cause we're waiting for a miracle
Why wait for a miracle? Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
And I've been through mountains and seas
Tryna get you to come back to me
And I've been far, and I've been so deep
Now I find it harder and harder to breathe

[Chorus]
And I need some new love
New love, new love
And I need some new love
New love, new love
A silent night, a lonely night
I didn't mean to wake you up I was leaving anyway
We never asked each other why
We only made each other cry
When the day becomes the night
And all that I have left inside is scattered on the wind

Didn't I give you all that love could bring
Didn't I give you more than everything
You know it hurts to end like this, when we've come so far

Don't tell me love is blind
Cause I know what I see
Tell me how you walk away when all you know is me
And all that might have been
And what we left behind
Don't ever let a living person tell you love is blind

Memories of summer days
Laughing like a little child lying in you arms
And we would own the stars like days of old
We'd make a vow to have and hold
Now we see the empty stage
The actors gone the empty page
The tears between the lines

Save me from these wild imaginings
Try to stop my heart remembering
Acting like there's someone else when there's only me

So tell me what to say
Tell me what to do
Tell me how to walk away when all I see is you
Shadows on the wall
Pictures in your mind
Never let a living person tell you love is blind
My Death Row Chain got a pharaoh face
Medalion you mad we on
Yea daddy home
Little daddy got to put his family on
Told my mama I'm her daddy too
I give my son the sun and the moon
Told my son stay out daddy closet

My Death Row Chain keep talking up (Look for me)
I pray to God every night. I still do that
I just wanted, I wanted God to know that even tho I was going through the worst of times I still recognize him as being something greater than myself
And that Im not gonna give up my faith just because its going bad for me
Cause he was there when I was living good, so I just want him to know that, you know that Im not no punk, and I'm not soft hearted. That when it gets bad I'm gonna be like ohh I dont believe in God no more
I believe in God all the time, everyday, all day, good and bad, rough and hard, 5 shots, jail time, everything
Good times, million dollars, benzs, all that, I always believe in God because he gave it all to me

[Intro]
Fuck what they talkin' 'bout
All a nigga hear is my chains clinkin' back and forth right now, nigga
Yeah, fuck with me

[Chorus]
Why the fuck you so opinionated?
Sayin' how you do it but they ain't did it, baby
You need a demonstration?
This is how you get richer, baby
I'm stimulated
I'm at the bank, I'm penetratin'
I'm puttin' in, I'm penetratin'
I'm gettin' big, I'm stimulated
I touched a bitch, she disintegrated
Up in flames, I've been the flamest
I've been the hottest, you've been the lamest
I've been on the plane, you've been complainin'
Fuck the co-defendant, pistol whip the plaintiff
Hit the mall, then we skip arraignment
They say she young, I should've waited
She a big girl, dog when she stimulated

[Verse]
Hit Sin City and syndicate it
All the time on the strip in Vegas
I got the juice but I ain't Minute Maid it
But a nigga made it just minutes later
Shut the fuck and let me finish, baby
I'll let you finish later
Why the fuck you so opinionated?
Yeah you book smart but don't be gettin' paper, uh!
Shootin' craps at The Wynn
Gettin' back to back wins
Made 20 bands playin' features
And I don't need a feature for this
Nigga I'm T-R-A, triple double
Every time I ball, man that's triple double
Tom Ford, Balmain, that's triple stuntin'
Tryna get a nut only gets you nothin'
So I don't give a fuck who these niggas datin'
Tsunami the Rollie, my wrist is flooded
How the fuck can these niggas hate it
When these bitches love it, man this shit is funny
All I can do is laugh, all I can do is laugh
They try to count me out, all day I'm doin' math
All I can do is add, multiply, multiply
All day I'm doin' math, but we won't divide
You ain't got the flow, you ain't got the heart
You be on your mark but you're never ready
You just talkin' shit, I can smell your breath
Sayin' what you do, but can't help yourself

[Chorus]
So why the fuck you so opinionated?
Sayin' how you do it but they ain't did it, baby
You need a demonstration?
This is how you get richer, baby
I'm stimulated
I'm at the bank, I'm penetratin'
I'm puttin' in, I'm penetratin'
I'm gettin' big, I'm stimulated
I touched the bitch, she disintegrated
Up in flames, I've been the flamest
I've been the hottest, you've been the lamest
I've been on the plane, you've been complainin'
Fuck the codefendant, pistol whip the plaintiff
Hit the mall, then we skip arraignment
They say she young, I should've waited
She a big girl, dog when she stimulated

[Bridge]
She a big girl, dog
Fuck what they talkin' about, nigga
She a big girl, dog
I'm gonna do what the fuck I wanna do when I wanna do

She a big girl, dog

Pop princess, p-p-pop princess

Pop, pop, pop, pop

[Verse 1]
I am a pop princess
Hip-hop, pop-rock, skip on the double
It's all about the disco, daddy
Disco, disco, Disney, daddy
Yes, I've got my hair extensions
Don't need no singing lessons
Autotune me up, baby
And let's get ravey

[Pre-Chorus]
You can sing my song
If you wanna sing along then put your hands in the air
'Cause if you wanna be seen
Come and be seen with me 'cause I'm a pop star
Yeah, I'm a pop star, ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh, I'm a pop star, ooh-ooh

Oh no, you burst my bubble
Now I'm in trouble, trouble
Oh no, you burst my bubble
Now I'm in trouble, trouble
I'm a bad girl but I got my goodies
Flavoured up in Tutti frutti
Watch me shake, sh-sh-shake-sh-shake it in your face
You like that? There's more where it came from
Come to my live show then we get the game on
Set me off like a party popper
Woo, woo, woo, I'm a show stopper

[Pre-Chorus]
I am a show

I am a robot show stopper

[Chorus]

Pop princess, p-p-pop princess

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Watcher
Radio Station, 187.4 FM on your dial
DJ Jam on the 

[?] giving you a blast
Yeah that's right y'all
Doing it to you Doggystyle on
187.4 FM on your dial W-Ballz

[Verse 1]
Things just ain't the same for gangsters
A lot of fake emcees, punks, and wanksters
R&B niggas wanna G Niggas
I tell you Jam I'm gonna have to go and see niggas
And pay you peasants a visit, my presence up in it
And it won't be no pleasant-able visit
See, I'mma reputable with it, just skeptical with it
I'm professional with it
You get it, you got it, you shoot it, you shot it
Plot it from the get-go
I'm the only West Coast nigga that get love on the East Coast
And swing it back down to Detroit to Chi-Town
Motherfucker, how you like me now?
And I'm not the little one, I'm the Big Bow Wow
W-Ballz, we do it doggystyle
We flippin' the script, mackin' a bitch
It's pimpin' on this motherfuckin' track, and shit

[Hook]
Everywhere that I go, ain't the same as before
People I used to know, just don't know me no more
But everywhere that I go, I got people I know
Who got people they know, so I suggest you lay low

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
I'm still on top of the game
Still dropping flames, still cock and aim
Still at the top had to rock for the fame
Over setbacks, there's been a lot since I came
You seen it all, how I got, how I gained
The momentum when it dropped, how I got through the pain
When I roll and shock, they watched me reclaim
The streets, they made a special spot for my name
Dre, haters wanna stop to my reign
But the music lives in me, every drop in my veins
The pride and the pain
All the way back from the rise of my name
See the world clear through the eyes of the mane
See the world cheer for the rhymes that I gave
When the beat bangs it'll drive them insane
The eyes that I played, the best to emerge in the game is the Watcher

[Bridge]
As soon as your clear in my scope I got you (got you)
Red dot you (red dot you)
The Watcher
Fools can't touch Aftermath we to hot (we to hot)
You can't stop us
Watch Us
Motherfuckers think they can do that
I got you, when I spot you, got you
It's too late if you see me on your block-uh
With my Glock cocked and call the doctor

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Rakim]
I'm Rated R, my brain contains graphics thangs
It turn traumatic teens into addicts, and fiends
It's like, watchin a movie through a panoramic screen
Which means, I can see the whole planet in the scene
Cash is the topic, the object, a fatter pocket
Some take the crack and chop it, but those that haven't got it
Take away the added profit, it's catastrophic
I take the gat and cock it, and I'll sit back and watch it
These New York streets is ugly, I keep it gully
The world is mine and can't nobody keep it from me
Yo, my neighborhood is never sunny
In the place where the number one cause of death is money
You can try copin', I've seen enough shit
To leave your frame of mind broken, I'm still alive and scopin'
Be another hundred years 'til my skies close in
And I'mma die with my eyes open, the watcher

[Intro]
Lying in the grass
Watching the stars come out

[Verse 1]
Come and get the dream, ghosts right through the cemetery
Feel the morning rain, dancing 'round the Colosseum
I can not explain, something in your chemistry
Power to your brain, power to the mind's museum
Come and get the dream, ghosts right through the cemetery
Feel the morning rain, dancing 'round the Colosseum
I can not explain, something in your chemistry
Power to your brain, brain, brain, brain, brain, brain

[Chorus]
If we can watch the stars come out
Find out what we like about
Everyone, without a doubt
If we can watch the stars come out
If we can watch the stars come out
Find out what we like about
Everyone, without a doubt
If we can watch the stars come out
If we can watch the stars come out
Find out what we like about
Everyone, without a doubt
If we can watch the stars come out
If we can watch the stars come out
Find out what we like about
Everyone, without a doubt
If we can watch the stars come out

[Interlude]
Lying in the grass
Watching the stars come out

[Verse 2]
Come and get the dream, ghosts right through the cemetery
Feel the morning rain, dancing 'round the Colosseum
I can not explain, something in your chemistry
Power to your brain, brain, brain, brain, brain, brain

[Chorus]
If we can watch the stars come out
Find out what we like about
Everyone, without a doubt
If we can watch the stars come out
If we can watch the stars come out
Find out what we like about
Everyone, without a doubt
If we can watch the stars come out
If we can watch the stars come out
Find out what we like about
Everyone, without a doubt
If we can watch the stars come out
If we can watch the stars come out
Find out what we like about
Everyone, without a doubt
If we can watch the stars come out

[Interlude]
Lying in the grass
Watching the stars come out
Lying in the grass
Watching the stars come out

[Outro]
Watch the stars come out
Watch the stars come out
Watch the stars come out
Watch the stars come out
Watch the stars come out
Watch the stars come out
Watch the stars come out
Watch the stars come out
Watch the stars come out
Watch the stars come out
Watch the stars come out
Watch the stars come out
Watch the stars come out

[Verse 1]
I've got to stop waiting for you
And move onto someone new
But everything around me is blue
The colour that reminds me of you
I've got to stop looking back
My head can get lost off track
And I know that you're not comin' back
But Lord, I wish you would now

[Verse 2]
I feel like my life's cut short
I feel like my love's shop-bought
I'm looking happy but I'm not
No I'm not, no, my baby
I feel like my life's cut short
I feel like my love's shop-bought
I'm looking happy but I'm not
No, no, no, oh

[Chorus]
When I think there's nothing left to lose
I take a look at what's in front of you
It's upsetting when I'm forced to choose
I'm reminded of the colour blue
When I think there's nothing left to lose
I take a look at what's in front of you
It's upsetting when I'm forced to choose
I'm reminded of the colour blue

[Verse 3]
I've got to stop waiting for you
And move onto someone new
But everything around me is blue
The colour that reminds me of you
I've got to stop looking back
My head can get lost off track
I know that you're not comin' back
But Lord, I wish you would now

[Chorus]
When I think there's nothing left to lose
I take a look at what's in front of you
It's upsetting when I'm forced to choose
I'm reminded of the colour blue
When I think there's nothing left to lose
I take a look at what's in front of you
It's upsetting when I'm forced to choose
I'm reminded of the colour blue
Can you talk in monochrome
Pleas, pleas
And throw this vehicle frame my bone
Pleas, pleas
Nobody's loved me before
Pleas, pleas
Never felt anyone mourn
Pleas, pleas

Why don't you give me what I want
Love you don't give yourself will always haunt

Drag me limping to the light
Hang my head up to the sky
Fight your fear with little lights
And I'll pretend that it's alright

I need to know if you hear my
Pleas, pleas
Do you wanna spend the night
Pleas me, yeah
Why don't tell me what you want
Love you don't give yourself will always haunt

Pleas, pleas, pleas, pleas
Pleas, pleas, pleas, pleas, pleas...

So will you talk in monochrome
Pleas, pleas

Konvict, Konvict, Konvict

So soft and slow, never knew a girl
Could be so god damn cold
I know, the way she move
Got me spendin' my dough
And yo, if you would've seen
What I seen on the pole, just know

That I was wrong for fallin' in love
I was wrong for fallin' in love
(They always say don't love a ho)
I was wrong for fallin' in love
(Don't do it, yo)
I was wrong for fallin' in love
(They always say don't love a ho)

But I just went against the grain
It was a feelin' I can't explain
And it felt like harmony, singin' in my face like
Diddy, daddy, doo, dah, day
I don't want it to ever go away
I want it 'round me every day
Singin' in my face like
Diddy, daddy, doo, dah, day

Look at me, I'm stuck, that bubble in my pants
Got me caught up, I never had no luck
Thinkin' with the wrong head got me
Jumpin' out there with no glove
It feels so good, had me sprung out all messed up
Now I'm stuck

That's what I get for for fallin' in love
That's what I get for for fallin' in love
(They always say don't love a ho)
That's what I get for for fallin' in love
(Don't do it, yo)
That's what I get for for fallin' in love
(They always say don't love a ho)

But I just went against the grain
It was a feelin' I can't explain
And it felt like harmony, singin' in my face like
Diddy, daddy, doo, dah, day

I don't want it to ever go away
I want it 'round me every day
Singin' in my face like
Diddy, daddy, doo, dah, day
So thick, so raw, that oil all over her body
Stole my heart, I'm caught
The way she drop down won't allow me
To close my drawers 'cause I'm already in love
And I knew better from the start, oh, no

I was wrong for fallin' in love
I was wrong for fallin' in love
(They always say don't love a ho)
I was wrong for fallin' in love
(Don't do it, yo)
I was wrong for fallin' in love
(They always say don't love a ho)

But I just went against the grain
I was a feelin' I can't explain
And it felt like harmony
Singin' in my face like
Diddy, daddy, doo, dah, day

I don't want it to ever go away
I want it 'round me every day
Singin' in my face like
Diddy, daddy, doo, dah, day

It was a feelin' I can't explain
And it felt like harmony
Singin' in my face like
Diddy, daddy, doo, dah, day
I don't want it to ever go away
I want it 'round me every day
Singin' in my face like
Diddy, daddy, doo, dah, day

[Lil Wayne]
It's everybody man
Everybody cross the Grove, everybody cross the Grove
You already knew, man
If you don't know what I'm saying
Then play this shit back, 'cause I don't know what I'm saying
But this is a dedication to the streets
The gangstas, the hood, the fallen soldiers
The down-ass chicks and the people in the slums
Young Money, muh'fucka (dedication to my Mom)
You understand me?
Dedication to our family
That was coming, you see how I spit
And we are Young Money, man
This is a dedication, people
It's gangsta grills, you motherfuckers
Understand that, and who I am?
I am Young Wayne, but now you can call me
This is "Tha Carter," people

[Verse 1]
Paint on a caution wind
Meet the bleeding sky
I called your name
There was no one there
And in the cold and snow
I saw your face

[Chorus]
And we sang the song for the little things
Magic call, but the joy you bring
Running it down the line
Wish you could find that love is a fragile thing
Magic call from a pretty thing
Maybe it might be time
For a better day
For a better day
For a better day

[Verse 2]
Straight, from the path of love
In the road of life
I tumble forward
But going on, I'mma keep it strong
I saw your face

[Chorus]
And we sang the song for the little thing
Magic call, but the joy you bring
Running it down the line
Wish you could find that love is a fragile thing
Magic call from a pretty thing
Maybe it might be time
For a better day
For a better day
(For a better day)
(For a better day)
(For a better day)
(For a better day)
And we sang the song for the little thing
Magic call, but the joy you bring
Running it down the line
Wish you could find that love is a fragile thing
Magic call from a pretty thing
Maybe it might be time
For a better day

[Chorus: Kristoffer Fogelmark]
Working my money ‘til I get gold
Monday-Friday mornin'
Working my money ‘til I get gold
Cause I can't get enough
Working my money ‘til I get gold
Monday-Friday mornin'
Working my money ‘til I get gold
Cause I can't get enough

[Verse 1: Earl St. Clair]
Started out with nothing and I still got most of that
The world ain't give me much, I'm positive that's a fact
Everybody said be cool, you be payin' your dues
Make a long story short, I got nothin' to lose

[Pre-Chorus: Earl St. Clair]
When I get it, I ain't ever goin' back again
When I get it, I ain't ever goin' back again
100 percent, yeah, pure grindin'
When I get it, I ain't ever goin' back again
When I get it, I ain't ever goin' back again
100 percent, yeah, pure grindin'
Oh, yeah

[Chorus: Kristoffer Fogelmark]
Working my money ‘til I get gold

Working my money ‘til I get gold
Cause I can't get enough
Working my money ‘til I get gold
Monday-Friday mornin'
Working my money ‘til I get gold
Cause I can't get enough

[Verse 2: Earl St. Clair]
Try to make a dollar out of 15 cents
But I ain't understand how the money was spent
My mama told me, "Boy you ain't got no sense
If we put it all together can we pay this rent?"
I've been some places
Places I never should've been
I caught some changes
Changes that made me who I am

[Pre-Chorus: Earl St. Clair]
When I get it, I ain't ever goin' back again
When I get it, I ain't ever goin' back again
100 percent, yeah, pure grindin'
When I get it, I ain't ever goin' back again
When I get it, I ain't ever goin' back again
100 percent, yeah, pure grindin'

[Chorus: Kristoffer Fogelmark]
Working my money ‘til I get gold
Monday-Friday mornin'
Working my money ‘til I get gold
Cause I can't get enough
Working my money ‘til I get gold
Monday-Friday mornin'
Working my money ‘til I get gold
Cause I can't get enough
Working my money ‘til I get gold
Monday-Friday mornin'
Working my money ‘til I get gold
Cause I can't get enough

That's MOB, nigga (Naw!)
Why you all dressed up, why your teeth messed up
Why you look so lost, nigga (Hellooo)
Don't get it twisted, down in the Dirty South
All we do is floss, nigga, that shit lit
Boss nigga, that one me
Ain't got time, can't no nigga take mine
That shit our shit, lose it? No way (Uh, uh, ow!)

[Pre-Chorus: Joba & Kevin Abstract]
I've been riding 'round with my people (Uh, Dirty South)
And I always put it down for my people (Uh, uh, Dirty South)
She ain't ever caught them Southern feels (Uh, dirty south)
But she gon' catch them southern feels

[Chorus: Joba & Kevin Abstract]
'Cause I get it while it's hot
I get it non-stop as I watch that body rock
Swanging through town, banging through town
Let me slow it down as I get my money right
Got this ice on my wrist, candy painted Lexus
Finna' hit a lick with my squad
Got a muddy cup of the purple stuff
Take a puff, get buck, feel the Southern love

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann & Joba]
Scumbag from the Lone Star state
Come around here?
You could be the next nigga on The First 48
Niggas run around with a snub .38
Gotta hold it down and protect your 28s
'Cause since 18
Nigga had a dream of that thang on the spokes
Got my mouth froze, got them thangs on the low
Who the fuck spoke?
Don't mind my southern drawl
Got a pocket full of stones for all of y'all
If he up, then watch him ball
Plot to make these niggas fall, shoot through walls
Take they money and they keys
And don't come back without it all
Screaming, "Fuck 'em and we ball"

[Pre-Chorus: Joba & Kevin Abstract]
I've been riding 'round with my people (Uh, Dirty South)
Always put it down for my people (Uh, Dirty South)
She ain't ever caught them southern feels (Uh, uh, Dirty South)
But she gon' catch them southern feels

[Chorus: Joba & Kevin Abstract]
'Cause I get it while it's hot
I get it non-stop as I watch that body rock
Swanging through town, banging through town
Let me slow it down as I get my money right
Got this ice on my wrist, candy painted Lexus
Finna' hit a lick with my squad
Got a muddy cup of the purple stuff
Take a puff, get buck, feel the southern love

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
Sock tan, pack of 'Ports
Dirty bitch, might double-cup her (Double-cup her)
Smokin' gas on the porch
Guess you could say I'm burning rubber (Burning rubber)
Head is good, so I learn to love her
My dogs talk in numbers
My iPhones got iPhones
So all my friends can talk to me (Hello?)
My flip phone even switch lanes (Ayy)
My bitch got that lipstick (Oh!)
Like candy paint, lick it off
Fuck me, then piss me off
Alexis, get my ren' on
Alexis, get my ren' on
Curve me, curve me (On what!)
Bitch don't hit my phone, CUT!

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon & Matt Champion]
Heard everything's supposed to be different 'round here
Gotta make sense of shit 'round here
It's like everybody wanna hit a lick 'round here
Guess I gotta stop giving shits 'round here
Been looking for a sign or some shit 'round here
Grind hard just to get a fuckin' grip 'round here
We don't sit 'round here, big shit 'round here
You a target if you don't fuckin' fit 'round here
Better charge it to the game, nigga (Charge it to the game)
We all going insane, better find a fuckin' lane
Doing digits in a Range, nigga (I don't even got a car)
No guts, no gain, no pain, no fame
We are not one and the same, nigga
I could change your whole life, we don't need no hype
Just to get shit lit for the night
We could set it off on a fuck nigga on sight

[Intro]
Oh, hey

[Verse 1]
Rollerskates, tan lines
Hot sun clear blue skies
The waves are crashing by
And when she passed me by
And gave a wink and smile
And I was on cloud nine
Lord

[Pre-Chorus]
The way you move your hips
And lick your lips
The way you dip
You got me up so high (hey-ey)
And girl you got that body
With them curves like a Bugatti
I just wanna drive, oh

[Chorus]
And girl you know
Round and round your loving winds me up
Like a hula, hula hoop, hula, hula hoop, oh
Round and round your loving winds me up
Like a hula, hula hoop, hula, hula hoop, oh
Round and round your loving winds me up
Like a hula, hula hoop, hula, hula hoop, oh
Round and round your loving winds me up
Like a hula, hula hoop, hula, hula hoop, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
And gravity defied
I can't believe my eyes
That thing can bring the tides, hey
And round and round clockwise
Like a merry-go-ride
I wanna go all night, yes

[Pre-Chorus]
The way you move your hips
And lick your lips
The way you dip
You got me up so high, yeah (hey-ey)
And girl you got that body
With them curves like a Bugatti
I just wanna drive, oh

[Chorus]
And girl you know
Round and round your loving winds me up
Like a hula, hula hoop, hula, hula hoop, oh
Round and round your loving winds me up
Like a hula, hula hoop, hula, hula hoop, oh
Round and round your loving winds me up
Like a hula, hula hoop, hula, hula hoop, oh
Round and round your loving winds me up
Like a hula, hula hoop, hula, hula hoop, oh

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh, yeah
Oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, yeah
Like a hula, hula hoop, hula, hula hoop, oh

[Chorus]
Round and round your loving winds me up
Like a hula, hula hoop, hula, hula hoop, oh
Round and round your loving winds me up
Like a hula, hula hoop, hula, hula hoop, oh
Round and round your loving winds me up
Like a hula, hula hoop, hula, hula hoop, oh

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Round and round your loving winds me up
Like a hula, hula hoop, hula, hula hoop, oh

[Intro]
Turn up
Soulja
Young Soulja
Young Soulja!
Life After Fame shit man, you know what I'm saying?
Stacks On Deck Money Gang
Rich Gang
Turn up

[Verse 1]
Pull up in that rubber, god damn Soulja taking over
10 chains on... dope with the baking soda
Forgiato rims, Burberry Timbs
Damn, Soulja outta here
This right here my here
Flexing 30 birds for the summer, pull up in a Hummer
Soulja number one, young stoner, you don't want the drama
Riding with the cake
AK-47, MAC-11 throw away
It's a good day, on my body
Nothing but 'Sace
Ralph Lauren
Steady touring
And my whip foreign
10 chains on my neck and I'm still flexing
Rich Gang, Young Soulja 'bout a check
Pull up to the hood, everything good
10 chains on, gripping leather wood
Riding 'round town, ready for the action
100 million dollars and I'm still trappin'

[Hook]
Trappin' trappin' trappin'
Trappin' trappin' trappin'
Trappin'
Trappin'
Trappin'
Trappin'
Trappin'
Trappin'
Trappin'
Trappin'
Trappin'
Trappin'
Trappin'
Trappin'

[Verse 2]
Hopping out the clean, (?) seen
'Sace in my body, in a limousine
Popping gold bottles, I'm going ham
Smoking loud, video on Instagram
50 bricks in
I've been stacking millions since 2010
Pull up in that all white cocaine, that Benz
Young Dre he flex, go hard a hundred M

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I got Medusa on my damn chain
Riding through the hood, blowing loud, and they know my name
2013, red beam
GT (?)
Smoking on loud, I jumped in the crowd
50k up on my bracelet watch like wow
Baking soda whip, a Rover going cray
Riding 'round town with that 38

[Hook]

[Hook]
I wonder, could it be you and I are a sign of the times?
Why can't we open our eyes to the sign of the times?

[Verse 1]
When I feel like I'm all out of love, and my time is up
It scares me, judge us fairly
If only music could make us understand
I swear sometimes I hear a ghost in the radio
I went from station to station searchin' for somewhere safe to go
I'm not the only one that's seen it
So there's no question, I believe it
I'm not crazy
Cause I can't move 'til it makes me
Please try to save as many as you can

[Hook]
Could it be you and I are a sign of the times?
Why can't we open our eyes to the sign of the times?

[Bridge]
Well it's something you can't deny, go 'head and ask me why
For the meaning, and if you think you're dreaming
Oh I have got the perfect song for you

[Verse 2]
If I time it just right, I won't have to say it again
Will my 2 cents be enough for you to play it again?
I put some weight on it
Repetition can change a human condition
Oh you need to listen, if it's the last thing that you do

[Hook]
Could it be you and I are a sign of the times?
Why can't we open our eyes to the sign of the times?

[Bridge]
Well it's something you can't deny, go 'head and ask me why
For the meaning, and if you think you're dreaming
Oh I have got the perfect song for you

[Hook]
Could it be you and I are a sign of the times?
Why can't we open our eyes to the sign of the times?
Could it be you and I are a sign of the times?
Why can't we open our eyes to the sign of the times?

[Washed Out]
I don't want you anymore

Do what you want, do whatever makes you happy
Do what you want, do whatever makes you happy

I don't want you anymore
I don't want you anymore

Do what you want, do whatever makes you happy
Do what you want, do whatever makes you happy

{Sample from The Notebook's "What do you want" scene}

[Allie Hamilton]
You arrogant son of a bitch !

[Noah Calhoun]
Would you just stay with me ?

[Allie]
Stay with you ? What for ? Look at us, we're already fighting !

[Noah]
Well that's what we do ! We fight ! You tell me when I'm being an arrogant son of a bitch and I tell you when you're being a pain in the ass ! Which you are... 99% of the time. I'm not afraid to hurt your feelings. They have like a two second rebound rate then you're back to doing the next pain in the ass thing

[Allie]
So what ?

[Noah]
So it's not gonna be easy. It's gonna be really hard. And we're gonna have to work at this everyday, but I wanna do that because I want you. I want all of you... forever. You and me... everyday

[Allie]
*cries hysterically*

[Noah]
Will you do something for me ? Please ? Will you just picture your life for me. Thirty years from now, forty years from now, what's it look like ? If it's with that guy, go. Go ! I lost you once, I think I can do it again... if I thought that's what you really wanted. But don't you take the easy way out !

[Allie]
What easy way ? There is no easy way. No matter what I do, somebody gets hurt !

[Noah]
Would you stop thinking about what everyone wants ? Stop thinking about what I want, what he wants, what your parents want. What do you want ? What do you want ?

[Allie]
It's not that simple... It's...

[Noah]
What do you want ? What do you want ?

[Intro]
I was born in a small village
I was still a child when we were raided by soldiers
Foreign soldiers
Torn from my elders, I was made to speak their language
With each new post, my masters changed
Along with the words they made me speak
With each change, I changed too
My thoughts, personality, how I saw right and wrong
Words can kill
Time and again, the country was ruled by a foreign tongue
When he was a young boy, he lost his native language
The bedrock for any developing child
His country, his family, his face, his identity
Everything was stolen from him

[Verse 1]
Meet me on the corner, I be waiting on you
Thousand years of better right into forever
Fire on my feathers, fall from out of heaven
Fight without a weapon, life without a lesson
Lost, I'm my own boss, pay my own cost
Fill my own goals, see my own hopes
Tired of all of this, wish I had a switch
One kiss then you cut me off
Knowledge is the power, college is for cowards
Hollering for hours, swallowing the sour
Skin stuck around the rims, peeking in on a life so sweet
The other side made it, why don't we?

[Interlude]
From ancient times, every civilization's ruler has had the same idea. When people unite under one will, they become stronger than the sum of their parts and what do rulers use to bring people together? Language. "This world will become one, I have found the way. Race, tribal affiliations, national borders - even our faces will be irrelevant. The world that the boss envisioned will finally become a reality and it will make mankind whole again

[Verse 2]
Found a friend in the words and my words and it works
Take away the pain, take away the hurt
Make a way to make a change, make it sane
Specially if you plan on staying on this Earth
Low to the lows, high to the highs
Eyes to the sky, strive to revive, dying to survive
Pool full of cries but it's cool, I'm still alive
And every breath is every left soul
And the family never kept whole
In the slum, want to quest to be the best of being less
Never let go, the best road to the next level
And the scenes where it's mean to do the right thing
Not to be a good king but the best devil
So it's horns for the crown, torn from the ground
Roses by the roots stolen from the roofs on parade days
Look at them rain down
I was brought here a slave
But I leave here a pharaoh

[Interlude]
America is a country of liberty, a meeting of immigrants
Instead of simply assimilating, its citizens live alongside others
So the major sought a system that used information
Words to control the subconscious
In his eyes, the greatest symbiotic parasite the world's ever known isn't microbial -- it's linguistic
Words is what keep civilization, our world, alive

[Outro]
If you are what you say you are, the coolest
Won't you just shine down?
You are what you say you are, the coolest
Won't you just shine down?
You know
I'm never gonna let you get away
I can't get enough of you
You know
Oh yeah
Oh well
Our loss

You know
I'm never gonna let you get away
I won't get enough of you
You know
Oh yeah
Oh well
Our loss

You know
I'm never gonna let you get away
I can't get enough of you (you)
Oh yeah
But oh well
Our loss (I lost)

[Verse 1]
Ring the alarm
Hot ass nigga
Big ass head
So my dreams get bigger
Me campaign strong
So my flows get sicker
Confidence bigger then a drunk ass nigga, look
Mama work graveyard shifts
5 to 9, not a 9 to 5
Shit, she might end up in a graveyard quick
She dead inside but she gotta provide
But, her father got a brand new kidney
While I'm out here hanging wit' Whitney
I'm guilty, need whiskey
Plus she a stuck up chick like Whitley
Look, so many paths
Don't know which one
Peter picked a pepper but I can't pick one
Niggas get grown but they minds so young
So me cyant fuck witcha but me cyant go run

[Hook]
I just wanna run away
I'm feelin' like I'm in a maze
I'm trapped in, I'm wilin' out
I'm tryna find me a bigger route, say
I just wanna run away
I'm feelin' like I'm in a maze
The same old things like everyday
I'm gettin' tired of everything, say

[Post-Hook]
I'm (Runnin')
I'm (Runnin')
I'm (Runnin')
I'm (Runnin')
I'm (Runnin')
I'm (Runnin')
Ah I'm (Runnin')
Ah I'm (Runnin')
I'm
I'm
Ah I'm (Runnin')
Ah I'm (Runnin')
I'm
I'm

[Verse 2]
Westside till I mothafuckin' die
Kevin got me flowin like I just got baptized
Runnin' through the money ya money is all lies
Matter for your matter, don't matter,  we all die
Grandfather told me things that I'll never forget
Told me fame and honor ain't bigger than respect
It's funny we don't honor the honest we all lie
Pinocchio niggas your noses is all nine
Inches, something like my dick is
Hate it when they mention
Did ya get my mentions
Question
Do you even fuck with a nigga like me?
Will ya bump me in about 3 days?
Really, IDC
'Cause every time a nigga talk
They can't see
The bigger picture, fuck yo filter
Me cyant go run but me cyant repeat
No!

[Verse 1: Jake]
Gold on the roof
Gold on the roof
Of your home
Of your home, woah oh
A Manchester wind
Fragile and thinner
A Boston clove
The Manhattan dinner

[Chorus: Jake, Jake & Nathan]
Shake it, I say, for me, honey
You shake it, I say, for my loving
You go on your own
With a fistful of heart
And a pocket full of stars
With a fistful of heart
Your heart
With a fistful of heart
And a pocket full of stars
With a fistful of heart

[Verse 2: Jake, Nathan & Whistler]
Gold on the roof
Gold on the roof
Of your home
Of your home
All dressed in lace
The mark of a sinner
A dollar bill
The Manhattan dinner

[Chorus: Jake]
Shake it, I say, for me, honey
You shake it, I say, for my loving
You shake it, I say, for me, honey
You go, oh, oh
Home, Home

[Outro: Jake]
Shake it, I say, for me, honey
You shake it, I say, for my loving
You shake it, I say, for me, honey
You shake it
Prologue"These songs were once about my life. They are now about yours."

I was born in Reading, Pennsylvania on December 13, 1989.

In the world we live in, much is said about when we are born and when we die. Our birthday is celebrated every year to commemorate the very instant we came into the world. And a funeral is held to mark the day we leave it. But lately I've been wondering... what can be said of all the moments in between our birth and our death? The moments when we are reborn...

The debate over whether people change is an interesting one for me to observe because it seems like all I ever do is change. All I ever do is learn from my mistakes so I don't make the same ones again. Then I make new ones. I know people can change because it happens to me little by little every day. Every day I wake up as someone slightly new. Isn't it wild and intriguing and beautiful to think that every day we are new?

For the last few years, I've woken up every day not wanting, but needing to write a new style of music. I needed to change the way I told my stories and the way they sounded. I listened to a lot of music from the decade in which I was born and I listened to my intuition that it was a good thing to follow this gut feeling. I was also writing a different storyline than I'd ever told you before.

I wrote about moving to the loudest and brightest city in the world, the city I had always been overwhelmed by... until now. I think you have to know who you are and what you want in order to take on New York and all its blaring truth. I wrote about the thrill I got when I finally learned that love, to some extent, is just a game of cat and mouse. I wrote about looking back on a lost love and understanding that nothing good comes without loss and hardship and constant struggle. There is no "riding off into the sunset," like I used to imagine. We are never out of the woods, because we are always going to be fighting for something. I wrote about love that comes back to you just when you thought it was lost forever, and how some feelings never go out of style. I wrote about an important lesson I learned recently... that people can say whatever they want about me, but they can't make me lose my mind. I've learned how to shake things off.

I've told you my stories for years now. Some have been about coming of age. Some have been about coming undone. This is a story about coming into your own, and as a result... coming alive.

I hope you know that you've given me the courage to change. I hope you know that who you are is who you choose to be, and that whispers behind your back don't define you. You are the only person who gets to decide what you will be remembered for.

From the girl who said she would never cut her hair or move to New York or find happiness in a world where she is not in love...

All I need, All I need

All I need, All I need
Is a little more time to take you higher

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Come through we can Netflix it up
She says, Bobby, you reckless as fuck
I said, girl, you know life is a bitch
Ain't no reason for dressin’ it up
Just give me your word
Even street sign wanna nigga for curt
Even peace sign got middle finger flipin' bird
And that's absurd as it seems
And love is a permanent thing
You ask for consistency is girl
We ain't no permanent beings
But give me some time, I see what we find
And maybe we stir up some things
Like what's under the surface, we're more than just servants
Cuz no one is perfect you see
But girl you're perfect for me
I need you to fill out of here
Day you certain to be
I was a thought and now in my heart
On my shirt, on my sleeve
But a king without his queen, where on earth would he be

[Pre-Hook: B.o.B]

Mr. Sandman, bring me a dream
Make her the sweetest girl that I've ever seen
Then give her two eyes like roses and clover
Then tell me that my lonesome nights are over

Ooh Sandman, I'm all alone

So please turn on your magic beam
And Mr. Sandman, bring me please
Come on, and bring me a dream

(Sandman) ooh Sandman, (bring him a dream) I want a little baby
(Make her the cutest) girl (that he's ever seen) that I've ever seen now

Two bitches in the shower, that's a water saver
Lil Turner droppin' headers, that's a soccer player
Hecka crooked off that muthafuckin' flower, cousin
Shout out lil Toro with that muthafuckin' slapper cousin
Bitch, I'm catchin' ugly, every single category
Bitch, I'm stackin' money, Europeans askin' for me
When I'm stackin' money, I just spent an allegory
I don't give a fuck, you would think it's magic, homie
Whippin' in a foreign, mama drive it like she stole it
Got the bitches tryna touch it, but I like the way that wifey hold it
Who my wifey though? It's complicated, I don't know
It seems like I'm changin' up my mind every fuckin' moment
I got problems, actin' like a fuckin' grown up
Hold up, stop, wait a minute, let me just explain it
Lil fucker, I don't wanna hit the bottle
So I hit it, then I fall asleep and
Wake up in it, hit it
Then I fall asleep and wake up in it

Please move, you're in the way

Please move, you're in the way
I'm heading home, I'm almost there
I'm on my way, headed up the stairs
Bro. Bro. Listen to the kids. Jeremy, I need, I gotta put it down for a second. It’s beautiful. Jeremy Scott's design.

First of all, thank you Taylor for being so gracious and giving me this award, this evening thank you. And I can think back to the first day I met you, also. You know. I think about, when I’m in the grocery store with my daughter, and I have a really great conversation about fresh juice and, you know. And at the end they say, "Oh, you’re not that bad after all." And like, I think about it sometimes. Like, it crosses my mind a bit like when I go to a baseball game. And um, sixty thousand people boo me. Crosses my mind a little bit. And I think if I had to do it all again what would I have done?

Would I have worn a leather shirt? Would I have drank a half a bottle of Hennessy and gave the rest of it to the audience Y’all know y’all drink that bottle too. If I had a daughter at that time, would I have went on stage and grab the mic from someone else's? You know, this arena tomorrow, it’s gonna be a completely different set up, some concert something like that. This stage will be gone, after that night, the stage is gone, but the effect that it had on people remain.

The, the problem was, the contradiction, the contradiction is, I do fight for artists, but in that fight I somehow, was disrespectful to artists. I-I didn’t know how to say the right thing. The perfect thing. I just, I sat at the Grammy’s and saw Justin Timberlake and Cee-Lo lose. Gnarls Barkley and the Future-Love... "SexyBack" album, and bro….Justin I ain’t tryna put you on blast but I saw that man in tears, bro. You know, and I was thinking like, "He deserve to win Album of the Year."

And this small box that we are as the entertainers of the evening. How could you explain that? Sometimes I feel like, you know, all this shit they run about beef and that, sometimes I feel like I died for an artist's opinion, for an artist to be able to have an opinion after they were successful. I’m not no politician bro. And look at that, you know how many times MTV ran that footage again, cause it got them more ratings? You know how many times they announced Taylor was gonna give me the award, cause it got them more ratings? Listen to the kids bro!

I still don’t understand award shows, I don’t understand how they get five people who work their entire life, won, sold records, sold concert tickets, to come stand on a carpet and for the first time in they live be judged on a chopping block and have the opportunity to be considered a loser. I don’t understand it bro. I don’t understand when the biggest album or the biggest video, I still don’t understand it, I been conflicted bro, I just wanted people to like me more. But fuck that bro!

Two thousand and fifteen. I will die for the art for what I believe in and the art ain't always gonna be polite. Y’all might be thinking right now, I wonder, did he smoke something before he came up here? The answer is yes, I rolled up a little something, I knocked the edge off. I don’t know what’s gonna happen tonight, I don’t know what's going to happen tomorrow bro.

But all I can say to my artists, my fellow artists, just worry how you feel at the time man, just worry about how you feel and don’t never, you know what I’m saying, I’m confident, I believe in myself. We the millennials bro, this is a new, this is a new mentality. We not gonna control our kids with brands. We’re not gonna teach low self-esteem and hate to our kids, we’re gonna teach our kids that they can be something. We gonna teach our kids that they can stand up for themselves. We gonna teach our kids to believe in themselves. If my grandfather was here right now, he would not let me back down.

I don’t know what I’m finna lose after this. It don’t matter though, it ain’t about me, it’s about ideas. People with new ideas. People who believe in truth.

And yes, as you probably could have guessed by this moment, I have decided in 2020, to run for President.

[Verse 1]
The first impulse to violence is probably right
The second impulse to stop it is probably wrong
Why do people only show forgiveness when they want to sound cool in a song?
So I keep tryin' to understand where we are goin'
I keep searchin' for some meanin' in my dreams
And I'm dreamin' of bein' eaten by a tiger
While the sparrows start to sing in a tree

[Chorus 1]
And we always end up singin' the same song
They remind us of the cool shit in the world
But they also remind us we are dying
That's why we want to sing even more

[Verse 2]
I don't think we got where we were goin'
I had a dream that we were in a weird sky
Why do people let their dreams be somethin' so bad?
Such a weird fuckin' dream
Flyin' around into the sky, like superman
Changing tigers and your arrows land sparrows
Those religious fucks will never understand

[Chorus 2]
And we always end up singin' the same song
They remind us of the cool shit in the world
Maybe it wasn't a dream
I can't really tell anymore

[Outro]
And we always end up singin' the same song
'Cause we always end up singin' the same song
Helps us to forget that we were wrong
And we always end up singin' the same song
And we always end up singin' the same song
Helps us to forget that we were wrong

[Chorus]
Yeah, I smoke pot
Yeah, I love peace
But I don't give a fuck
I ain't no hippy
Yeah, I smoke pot (Do it)
Yeah, I love peace (Do it)
But I don't give a fuck (Do it)
I ain't no hippy (Ah)
Yeah, I smoke pot
Yeah, I love peace
But I don't give a fuck (Do it)
I ain't no hippy (Do it)
Yeah, I smoke pot (Do it)
Yeah, I love peace (Do it)
But I don't give a fuck (Ah)
I ain't no hippy
(Do it)

[Bridge]
(I understand)
Feel like I am one with the universe (I understand)
And all I need is right here (I understand)
Feel like I am part of the universe
And it's part of me (I understand)

[Verse 1]
Why there is a sun?
And how do birds fly?
And why there is a moon
Way up in the sky?
Why there is trees? (Do it)
And what the fuck is love? (Do it)
And what is flying saucers
Watching from above?
(Yo
Fuck, man)

[Bridge]
Feel like I am one with the universe
And all I need is right here
Feel like I am part of the universe
And it's part of me

[Verse 2]
Yo, sing about love
Love is what you need
Loving what you sing
And loving smoking weed (Weed, weed, weed, weed)
Sing about peace
Being high and free
So if you don't give a fuck
Sing along with me

[Chorus]
Yeah, I smoke pot (Smoke pot)
Yeah, I love peace (Love peace)
But I don't give a fuck (Give a fuck)
I ain't no hippy (Fuck)
(I understand)

[Verse 3]
Why there is a sky?
And why do pigs run?
And why them motherfuckers
Putting bullets in they gun?

[Breakdown]
(Get your ass up off that floor now)
(Yep, yep, yep, yep)
(Yep, yep, yep, yep)
Peace muthafuckers, peace muthafuckers
(Yep, yep, yep, yep)
Peace muthafuckers, peace muthafuckers
(Yep, yep, yep, yep)
Peace muthafuckers, peace muthafuckers
(Yep, yep, yep, yep)
Peace muthafuckers, peace muthafuckers
(Yep, yep, yep, yep)
Peace muthafuckers, peace muthafuckers
Peace muthafuckers, peace muthafuckers
Peace muthafuckers, peace muthafuckers
Peace muthafuckers, peace muthafuckers

[Verse 4]
Violence is king
But peace is the way
Someday we're gonna see it
So here's what I'm saying

[Outro]
Peace mu'fucker (Do it)
Peace mu'fucker (Do it)
Peace mu'fucker (Do it)
Peace mu'fucker (Do it)
Peace mu'fucker (Do it)
Peace mu'fucker (Do it)
Peace mu'fucker (Do it)
So peace mu'fucker (Do it)
Why they put the dick in the pussy?
Fuck you

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
Sun Gods crest upon his azure shield
Shows you what you know ain’t what you feel
Shooting beam, blinding me
The sun is a giant spaceship tangerine
It shoots out rays of hopeful golden morphine
Tangerine shooting beam
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Tangerine shooting beam
As I stand before this holy sphere
It’s singing me a song I don’t want to hear
Want to hear

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Uh huh, yeah, yeah, woah
All I see is warm champagne
Confetti on the floor from last night, still laying
The same playlist on my phone, still playing as my eyes strain
Jealous of the sun, wishing I could do the same
Man, but how I’m supposed rise though when shit just hold me down?
How I'm supposed to shine man, through all the smoke and clouds?
I’m on a trip, no luggage, no ticket
I’m looking in the mirror and I’m the only thing missing
I been tryna find myself, I feel so long distance
Made a promise to myself, I wouldn't just be a statistic
No, no, I’m the one of the one on one’s
Twenty some but my soul a hundred some
My mind’s racing, it’s racing
And honestly I can’t remember what it’s running from
I just hope that I come in one
Seems like everyone I know is getting married
Everyone else getting buried
Life should come with a sign saying "results may vary”
Straight up

[Outro: Miley Cyrus]
I take my place along the memory
The sun’s so high, it’s rising in the heat
Try to fight the sunrise but it comes for you
Love is brighter than the fiery violent truth

[Chorus]
The sunrise insists on gladness
But how can I be glad now my flower is dead
Oh, sun, I see you happy
You made the morning dew
Now you're showing me the truth
I don't want to believe you

[Verse 1]
The night has the power
To hold all your helplessness in
Heaven
The darkness and sadness
Hold to each other 'til tomorrow

[Chorus]
The sunrise insists on gladness
But how can I be glad now my flower is dead
Oh, sun, I see you happy
You made the morning dew
Now you're showing me the truth
I don't want to believe you

[Verse 2]
Death, take me with you
I don't wanna live without my flower
Tomorrow, tomorrow
The time that it takes for love to effect a person
So deep, so deep
So deep

[Outro]
Oh sun, oh sun
Oh sun, oh sun
Oh sun, oh sun
I see you happy
Oh sun, oh sun

[Chorus]
When we're driving, you're saying "go faster"
And when we're singing to the radio, you're saying "make it louder"
And you roll another one
You wanna get higher
And when I need the fire, you're always my lighter

[Verse 1]
When we're rolling, you always put your feet on mine
And when I’m running late, you always remind me of the time
When I'm feeling low, you lift me to the moon and back
Back into your arms
I won't let go until I know how much you really love me, baby

[Interlude]
I see a light

[Verse 2]
And I've heard we never truly see ourselves
You gotta leave it up to someone else to know how beautiful you really are, baby
We never get to see ourselves sleeping peacefully next to the ones that we love
We never see us cry, when someone dies, they see us crying
Someone new was born, baby

[Chorus]
When we're driving, you're saying "go faster"
And when we're singing to the radio, you're saying "turn it louder"
And you roll another one
You wanna get higher
And when I need the fire, you're always my lighter

[Bridge]
I see a light coming towards me
Moving slowly, but coming quickly at the same time
I think it represents what's going on in my mind
When we're together, everything's so sweet
Nowhere in the world I’d rather be
As long as I got you, and you got me, baby
I could leave here
I don’t need nothing but you
You’re starting out beyond just us two
Forever gets complicated, but it don’t have to be that way, baby

[Outro]
I see a light coming towards me
Moving slowly, but coming quickly at the same time
I think it represents what's going on in my mind
What's going on in my mind
I think it represents what's going on in my mind
What's going on in my mind
I think it represents what's going on in my mind
What's going on in my mind

[Verse 1]
Something in the way you love me
Something in the way you stare
I wanna be there skateboarding
In a space dude's evil lair

[Verse 2]
Something in the way you fuck me
You're never fucking there
Something in the way you touch me
I wonder, I should care?
Okay, keep that last one

[Verse 3]
Sleeping makes us optimistic
And we can't live without dreaming
It's the only time we can really be together
But I'm optimistic
There's something giving me that feeling
There's something giving me that feeling
There's something
There's something giving me that feeling
There's something

[Verse 1]
Sitting here with nothing to say
Looking out the window
It just rained, but the sun's up for the day
And there's probably a rainbow
But I don't care 'cause all the colors left with you
Thinking about driving around in your car
I never thought that we would take it very far
I just love talking, and then parking, then we'd go walking
I loved you so much
I just started watching TV
I get so high 'cause you're not here smoking my weed
And I get so bored 'cause you're not here to make me laugh
You're so cute in your space suit
In your space boots
Space dude
Since you've left, I've started to drink
Sometimes now, when I do drugs I'll start to overthink, and I start crying
I think I'm dying
But I'm just tripping
Start spiraling down this hole

[Chorus]
Oh, space dude in your space boots
I got to be high to deal with your moods
But maybe it's me, I got to change my view
Oh, space dude in your space suit
Our love, it takes us to the moon
But you leave me up there, I'm so marooned
Oh, space dude in your space boots and your space suit
Space dude
Space dude in your space boots and your space suit
Space dude

[Verse 2]
Every time we talk I feel like shit
I guess I was just tryin' to avoid letting myself feel like this
'Cause it makes me feel like I might die
But every second I'm doing that anyway
My biggest fear is not being with you
The pain is so excruciating I don't know what I'd do
We're both vegan
It makes it easy to think you’d never hurt anything
Living intentionally

[Chorus]
Oh, space dude in your space boots
I got to be high to deal with your moods
But maybe it's me, I got to change my view
Oh, space dude in your space suit
Our love, it takes us to the moon
But you leave me up there, I'm so marooned
Oh, space dude in your space boots and your space suit
Space dude
Space dude in your space boots and your space suit
Space dude

[Chorus]
I forgive you
I ain't 'bout that shit, so I forgive you
It's too late to switch, so I forgive you
It ain't 'bout that bitch, so I forgive you, but I'll forget you
I forgive you
I ain't 'bout that shit, so I forgive you
It's too late to switch, so I forgive you
It ain't 'bout that bitch, so I forgive you, but I'll forget you

[Verse]
I didn't mean all the shit I said
But it's better than what's going on in my head
How dare you bring another chick in our bed
You’re lucky I’m doing my yoga, or you might be dead
I ain’t doin nothing that could take away my zen
Gave you another chance and then you fucked it up again
Life’s a bunch of tests, and we all just do our best
Searching for something outside ourselves to bring us happiness, yes

[Chorus]
I forgive you
I ain't 'bout that shit, so I forgive you
It's too late to switch, so I forgive you
It ain't 'bout that bitch, so I forgive you, but I'll forget you
I forgive you
I ain't 'bout that shit, so I forgive you
It's too late to switch, so I forgive you
It ain't 'bout that bitch, so I forgive you, but I'll forget you

[Bridge]
You and I dont know what goes on for us
If we leave it to the stars, we’ll both know what’s aligned for us

[Chorus]
I forgive you
I ain't 'bout that shit, so I forgive you
It's too late to switch, so I forgive you
It ain't 'bout that bitch, so I forgive you, but I'll forget you
I forgive you
I ain't 'bout that shit, so I forgive you
It's too late to switch, so I forgive you
It ain't 'bout that bitch, so I forgive you, but I'll forget you

[Outro]
Forgive you, but I'll forget you
I'll forgive you

[Interlude to BB Talk]
Alright this is really fuckin' fucked up but, but, but

Fucked up, fucked up
Fucked up, fucked up
Fuck, fuck fuck, fucked up

F-F-Fucked up

[Intro]
I'm 'bout to get fucked up, wanna get fucked up?
Fucked up
I'm 'bout to get fucked up, wanna get fucked up?
Fucked up
I'm 'bout to get fucked up, wanna get fucked up?
Fucked up
I'm 'bout to get fucked up, wanna get fucked up?
Fucked up

[Verse 1]
The only laws I obey, the ones I'm makin' for myself
So why you make me play on the rules of someone else?
Self control is not something I'm working on
We fuck, you turn me on, is all I can say about you

[Chorus]
I feel like a slab of butter that is melting in the sun
Aggression melts away now that you and me are one
Now that you and me are one
Now that you and me are one
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on

[Verse 2]
Nature made a hole and now it's open full of sweat
Like a scorpion on fire, stinging myself to death
I can’t extinguish what is instinctual
You turn me on, is all I can say about you

[Chorus]
I feel like a slab of butter that is melting in the sun
Aggression melts away now that you and me are one
I feel like a slab of butter that is melting in the Sun
Aggression melts away now that you and me are one
Now that you and me are one
Now that you and me are one
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on
You turn me on

[Verse 1]
I had a dream David Bowie taught us how to skateboard
But he was shaped like Gumby
And I had a dream we took a helicopter
Flew it up too high, got stuck in the clouds
Don't wanna come down
And I had a dream
We went on a safari
I said, "Look at that lion, she reminds me of you 'cause you're the queen."
And I had a dream that you were dying
But I wasn't even crying
I just sang you to sleep, I sang you to sleep

[Chorus]
But what does it mean?
What does it all mean?
Oh, I had a dream
What did it mean?
What did it mean?

[Verse 2]
And I had a dream we robbed the record store
The one with the yellow door
We stole every goddamn record they had
And I had a dream that I didn't give a fuck
But I give a fuck
I miss you so bad, I think I might die

[Chorus]
What does it mean?
What does it all mean?
I had a dream
But, what did it mean?
What did it mean?
I just wanna scream
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
I just wanna scream
I just wanna scream

[Breakdown]
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
I had a dream
But what does it mean?
What does it mean?
I had a dream
But what does it mean?
What does it mean?
What does it all mean, mean?

[Verse 3]
And I had a dream we were being chased by a monster
Or maybe they were aliens
But I wasn't scared 'cause you were there
And I had a dream we took karate
That's when you said you loved me
You loved me

[Outro]
What does it mean?
What does it all mean?
What does it mean?
What does it all mean?
Fuck yeah

[Verse 1]
Alright, so this is really fucked up, but
Alright, I was sleeping next to him but I was dreaming about the other dude
And then all of a sudden, everything that he fucking did just made me cringe and it was so hard to fall in but so easy just to fall back right out again
This whole time, I could give to you and I could paint you pictures but I guess I could just never write a song and then maybe I'd never fell out of love with him in the first place
I mean, I, I don't wanna feel this feeling cause my energy's just so strong that, I don't know if I'm creating this or this is actually what is meant to be
And you know that, they say that you gotta think what you want into existence, but you know, I haven't been too good at making decisions so, I have no idea what the fuck I want, I guess

[Chorus 1]
You're giving me a feeling in my head
Laying in my bed just thinking
Not really feeling like the one I want
Takes everything in me not to call him
I really, really, really want it, too
I told all my friends I'm moving on
Your baby talk is creeping me out
Fuck me so you stop baby talking

[Verse 2]
You know what, in the beginning it was like we were fucking homies and shit and then all of a sudden you started with some fucking baby goo-goo tongue down my fucking throat
I mean, even in front of your mom
Dude, as if I'm not fucking awkward enough
I mean, you put me in these fucking situations where I look like a dumbass bitch and I'm not a fucking dumbass bitch
You know, like, I hate all that fucking PDA, I probably hate it more than your fucking friends do
You know, it's sweet and you couldn't be more opposite of my last dickhead but, you know I just, I don't know if I can get over the fucking goo

[Chorus 2]
You keep saying again and again
We're laying in my bed just talking
And now I, now I can't hold it back
I'm feeling like I'm gonna vomit
I don't really wanna let go of you
I heard I change my mind way too often
Your baby talk is creeping me out
Fuck me so you stop baby talking

[Verse 3]
Alright, so, I'm gonna be honest
It's the super cutey shit, that's the main issue here
I mean, I'm fucking what?
Look, I like when you send me, you know, the, the queen emoji, but when I send back the monkey, you know, the ones with the, the hands over the eyes? That means that shit's just getting a little too weird for me
I mean, I don't wanna say it in person, I just bury my head in your armpit which... weirdly smells good and your hair and your fucking teeth
Like, why the fuck would I wanna lick your teeth but I do
And remember there was that one time that I had like a 15 minute...
Well, that was kind of the best thing in the entire world
You know, maybe I could just get past this shit and I could get used to someone giving a fuck
I'm sorry I called you a creep and that thing about the vomit
I mean, look, I'm really starting to be in this whole thing, but no matter what you do, homegirl can't handle the fucking goo

[Chorus 3]
Fuck me so you'll stop baby talking
Fuck me so you'll stop baby talking
Fuck me so you'll stop baby talking
Fuck me so you'll stop baby talking
I don't really wanna get over you
I heard I change my mind way too often
Baby talk is creeping me out
Fuck me so you'll stop baby talking

[Verse 1]
We all walk around and waste life
It's just gonna go on forever
Like there's some eternal endless supply of what it takes to keep us alive
There might be a day when everything goes away
To remind us how ungrateful our culture is
We need to take time to replace what's stolen from Mother Nature

[Chorus]
We only have 1 sun, 1 moon
1 me, 1 you
And we only have a little time to show how much we love
The sun (the sun), the moon (the moon)
How much I really love you
And we only have a little bit of time (time, time, time)

[Verse 2]
I once heard Grace Jones say I have my own concept of time
I always think 'bout that 'cause I've always felt like
I was running a little behind
What's in front of me?
I don't know, 'cause I can't see what hasn't started to grow

[Chorus]
We only have 1 sun, 1 moon
1 me, 1 you
And we only have a little time to show how much we love
The sun (the sun), the moon (the moon)
How much I really love you
And we only have a little bit of time (time, time, time)

[Bridge]
Wake up, world
Can't you see the earth is crying?
Wake up, world
Can't you see all the clouds are dying?
And maybe one day there won't be rainbows
Grass won't be green and the sky won't be blue
I don't wanna see a cyclone
There's no sun, no moon
No me, no you

[Chorus]
We only have 1 sun, 1 moon
1 me, 1 you
And we only have a little time to show how much we love
The sun (the sun), the moon (the moon)
How much I really love you
And we only have a little bit of time (time, time, time)

[Verse 1]
I sleep with the door open if you want to come in while I'm sleeping
I'm always sleeping naked, 'cause you wake up and you're creeping
Want to lick it so much that it's almost like I taste it on the tip of my tongue
I want to touch it so bad that it's almost like I can feel it on my fingertips
I want yours inside of me, but don't forget where I like licking, babe
I want to make your fantasies realities I want to be your's, babe

[Chorus]
I want you to bang my box
I want you to bang my box

[Verse 2]
There ain't nothing I'm scared to try
I can be on top, or if you like it I just lie here
Take my picture
Position my body wherever you like
Just know I like it naughty
Teach me a lesson, pretend we never met
But we can keep just kissing, 'cause you're getting me so wet
The only downside to this morning is you getting up and you leaving
When I'm dreaming and you're in 'em I wake myself up, 'cause I'm screaming
Uh-huh, what are you doing to me?
It's like you're a zookeeper setting animals free
You release me like a tiger that's been locked in a cage
Here I am, here you are
I want it so hard
You finger my heart
And I know just what I need
What I came here to do
What I've been thinking, babe, been most about you

[Chorus]
I want you to bang my box
I want you to bang my box

[Outro]
You say it tastes like cake with my lips against your face
Want you to eat it, babe

[Intro]
The milky, milky
The milky, milky, milky milk
The milky, milky milk
The milky, milky milk
The milky, milky milk

[Verse 1]
The purple that is collapsing
Head for the hills
And prepare your intellect to flow
Oh, oh, oh
The game of life is changing
Man is about to awake
Electric sun beams dancing
In a liquid in my skull

[Chorus 1]
The milky, milky milk
Your tongue licking me so hard
And from sucking on your nipples
Licking milky, milky stars

[Post-Chorus]
I feel like a slab of butter
That is melting in the sun
Aggression melts away (The milky, milky milk)
Now that you and me are one (The milky, milky milk)

[Verse 2]
I made a 'nilla sundae
And the greatest truth appear
That opened up the flood tides
Of the last two billion years
I ask myself a question
What the fuck is God?
But I knew that I knew it
From the milky, milky gods

[Chorus 2]
The milky, milky milk
Your lips get me so wet
While I'm singing all the verses
From the Tibetan Book of Dead

[Bridge]
The milky, milky milk
The milky, milky milk
Yeah, I'm digging it
It's kind of a molecular thing
Yeah, I'm digging it
It's kind of a molecular thing
Yeah, I'm digging it
Yeah, I'm digging it

[Outro]
I feel like a slab of butter (Yeah, I'm digging it)
That is melting in the sun (Yeah, I'm digging it)
Aggression melts away (Yeah, I'm digging it)
Now that you and me are one (The milky, milky milk)
(Yeah, I'm digging it)
Now that you and me are one (Yeah, I'm digging it)
Now that you and me are one (The milky, milky milk)
Yeah, I'm digging it
Yeah, I'm digging it
Yeah, I'm digging it
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Eyes are strange
They say everything while our mouths just try to sing
Singing something
I can never fall forever and ever
So I try to understand it all, but I fail to live it up
I'm still standing here forever without sunshine in my mind

[Chorus]
Yeah, I've been alive, but I've been a liar
Yeah, I've been alive, but I've been a liar
There's some kind of love that's so much higher
Yeah, I've been alive, but I've been a liar

[Verse 2]
I've seen death, I’ve seen truth
I've heard lies, I've seen birth too
I've seen happiness, I've seen pain
I've seen the sun come up and I've kissed the moon
I’ve heard voices through the wall
I've seen figures in my bed
I feel protected by things I don't understand
And that's more than you could say

[Chorus]
Yeah, I've been alive, but I've been a liar
Yeah, I've been alive, but I've been a liar
There's some kind of love that's so much higher
Yeah, I've been alive, but I've been a liar

[Verse 1]
Evil is but a shadow that always accompanies the good
You can try to have a world, a world without the shadow
But it will be a dark, dark and hopeless world
'Cause it would be a world, a world without light too
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
The light of nature
The light of the true
The light of silence
The light of all I do
The brigter it shines from the mountain
The more evil hides in its hole
Enjoy soo hard to defeat us
A world starting to lose your control
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
-Trol, lose your control
-Trol, lose your control
-Trol, lose your control
-Trol, lose your control

[Bridge]
We won't stop
We'll let it go, it drop
How'd it get to be so obvious?
I'll have fun
We won't stop
We'll let it fucking drop
We won't stop, oh
I'll have fun

[Outro]
Evil is but a shadow
A shadow in this world
Evil is but a shadow
A shadow in this world
Evil is but a shadow
A shadow in this world

[Verse 1]
They say love grows, but I've only seen it die
I'm too young to feel like I'm running out of time

[Chorus 1]
I get so scared
Thinking I'll never get over you
I always be making a compromise no matter what I do, ooh
And maybe I'll never get over you

[Verse 2]
I've heard no one controls what happens in our lives
The universe gets to decide
Our future is written up here in the sky

[Chorus 2]
And I get so scared
Thinking I'll never get over you
Everything I've imagined
And none of our plans coming true

[Bridge]
I met someone new, and now I'm scared to go all the way
I hear you in my mind, and can't let go of what you used to say
I'm freakin', it's repeating when you said there'll never be a day
When letting go feels like before, tonight we're trying anyway

[Chorus 3]
And I get so scared
Thinking they'll all be just like you
All the ways that you hurt me
And all of the shit you put me through

[Outro]
But maybe they'll all be just like you
Or maybe, they’ll never come close to you
So maybe, I'll never get over you
Baby

[Intro]
Benjamins baby
Benjamins (Yeah)
Benjamins baby
Benjamins (Yeah)
Benjamins baby
Benjamins (Yeah)
Benjamins baby
Benjamins (Yeah)

[Pre Hook]
Look
Everybody wanna piece, wanna piece
I fought with lions in the belly of the beast
I did things that would drive y'all to drink
I was thinking 'bout fucking on the sink
Got interrupted by the urgency to make cash
Ha, shit

[Hook]
I speak now, mother-motherfucka whiplash
Whiplash, my momma said it like
Aye, I gotta play the game so I can change the game
Shit, I gotta play the game so I can change the game
Lord, I gotta play the game so I can change the game
Game game, gotta play the game
Gotta play the game

[Verse 1]
Like aye, I gotta play the game so I can change the game
She want Balenciaga heels upon the frame
Ha, so deny her that is what I aim
But trying man will get it hotter than a frying pan
And I demand you come here with some rubber band a couple bands for mine too light
Ha, baby give it to me
I kinda want you to see
The realist you'll encounter any group category sub-genre
I'm honest and never pussy
Ha, these fools dying over looseleaf
Ha, I'ma be honest that I ain't too G
For a few G's or a few bees-dumb
I just view greed, but you seeing green thumbs
Aye whatchu growing?
My nigga whatchu growing?

[Pre Hook]
Everybody wanna piece, wanna piece
I fought with lions in the belly of the beast
I did things that would drive y'all to drink
I was thinking 'bout fucking on the sink
Got interrupted by the urgency to make cash
Shit

[Hook]
I speak now, mother-motherfucka whiplash
Whiplash, my momma said it like
Aye, I gotta play the game so I can change the game
Shit, I gotta play the game so I can change the game
Like aye, I gotta play the game so I can change the game
Shit, I gotta play the game
I Gotta play the game

[Verse 2]
Like yo, I gotta spend some change so I can get some change
Try me on night like Rihanna when she had the bangs
Smoking Cubana, rock designer, drive the newest Range
But aye my God that isn't everything
Yes, the realist niggas never make the claims
Ha, that the dollars that make
I'd rather take a pay-cut before I be a fake fuck
Needing your attention, do I need to mention that
Dollars burn, dreams don't?
You switching teams, why bro?
You can be aware and still fly
Whether or not, you gon lose a lot but what do I know?
What do I know?
What do I know?
Shit, I don't even know
But that shit don't make you blow like

[Pre Hook]
Everybody wanna piece, wanna piece
I fought with lions in the belly of the beast
I did things that would drive y'all to drink
And I was thinking 'bout fucking on the sink
Got interrupted by the urgency to make cash
Ha shit

[Hook]
I speak now, mother-motherfucka whiplash
Whiplash, my momma said it like
Aye, I gotta play the game so I can change the game
Shit, I gotta play the game so I can change the game

Every day she say she find somebody and it ain't me
And I'm getting the feeling that she finna creep

[Verse 2: Andre 3000]
Fuck that, double back
Park my car next to a puddle that
For everything that Andre 3000 it would irritate me
But I would rather see
My lover back
So I ran like hot bubble bath
To learn if my lover's laugh had come in rap
But bought this new hovercraft
It felt so bad
So I ran up the stairs and I stand with my peoples
Pull off her panties while she was still packin'
She responded like how I would have wanted
If I were leavin' and I'm ac'in
I said "woman tell me what is goin' on the air between us
And I love you"
Lord had conveyed it, the meanin' to me
And I mean it, Sabrina and Venus shoot
She keep up that record cause she wanna to keep scores
Fuck those habits
Like me and you those damn habits
Flip back on a mattress
And I will need answer the phone right away
If that I think we gone

[Hook: Timbaland & Future]
I think my girl might be cheating on the low
She say she need her space and she say she need to go
Oh man, I think my girl might be cheating on the low

[Verse 3: Tink]
He could be alone with a dancer
Hear it in his tone when he answer
Four or five hoes in a week
But if I go out to cheat
Then I have no standards
But tonight I'mma leave
Find me someone in these streets
Frequent them slowly and not feel emotion
Cause he would do the same to me no doubt
So I'mma get even, I never believed in you telling me a lie
I'mma get busy and find me a nigga to lay with tonight
Pimpin' ain't nothing but game, treat all these niggas the same
Niggas and women, we all lie about how we living
We all lie about where we staying
We all lie about who we laying, we all do
We all lie about who we cuffing
We all lie about who we fucking, we all do
Baby don't worry about me, I be on the run like B
You ain't gotta hide your face cause I'm probably in the room right next to your suite

[Hook: Timbaland & Future]
I think my girl might be cheating on the low
She say she need her space and she say she need to go
Oh man, I think my girl might be cheating on the low

[Chorus x2]
Baby if we leave the club
Won't be nothing but good lovin'
Cause I got a warm bed
I got a warm bed

[Verse 1]
Damn, it's hot, floor is locked
Can't believe all that ass that you got
Talking slick girl might get you got
If you do that again then I'ma have to arrest you
You telling me don't stop
You must not understand why they call me Foxx
For how long I can stay in the box
I all ready know how I plan to possess you

[Pre-Chorus]
Kiss you right below your navel then rub you with oil
Bite on your ear
Till you stand up make you turn around and touch your toes
The next thing girl, you already know

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Better yet, enough of the talking
Cause the Patron says it's time to get it popping
Bartender swipe the black card I'm walking
Cause she wants to do something like the girls in the films do
She wants to see if the Oscar was the fluke or is the nigga really proper
Guaranteed I can tell I got one
That is waiting for the camera to start rolling so she can let you

[Pre-Chorus + Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Shorty trust me when I say
You're looking John Blaze
In your lingerie
And shorty, I like the way you play
And move about on stage
I won't be mad at you
For swingin' it my way

[Hook]

We can ease off to the V.I.P (Yes, we can)
Come and get this money

[Verse 2]
Not too many, wear it quite as well
You take care of yourself

And not too many can go into a split
From standing to a sit

Not one bit

[Hook]

Big faces spankin' brand new (Spankin' brand new)
While I'm here, this is what you need to do (This is what you need, this is what you need)
Come and get this money (Ohhh)
If you don't want everyone to see (They don't have to see, no)
Just how naughty you can really be (But they know you're doing something)
We can ease off to the V.I.P (Come and go with me)
Come and get this money (Come and go with me)

[Bridge]
I got more than 5 on it

While I'm here, this is what you need to do (Baby)
Come and get this money (Come and get this money from me)
If you don't want everyone to see (If you don't want nobody)

While I'm here, this is what you need to do (Fat ass when you pop it, girl)
Come and get this money (You know a nigga can't leave you)
If you don't want everyone to see (They don't have to see)
Just how naughty you can really be (Work it privately for me)
We can ease off to the V.I.P (Whoo)
Come and get this money (Ohhh, baby, you can get it)

[Verse 1]
Walked up in the spot like what
Gettin’ love from the ladies and the thugs
I’m just tryna get this party off
So this be a night to remember
Ladies lookin’ so damn fly
About ten of them caught my eyes
I might show them the time if their lives
Cause its a special party tonight

[Chorus]
Everybody in my party is VIP
We gon' sip champagne for free
Your night of ecstasies on me
Lettin’ people in
Cause everybody in my party is VIP
We gon' shot patron for free
Your night of ecstasies on me
Come on to VIP

[Verse 2]
Niggas ain’t been givin’ no mugs
Their just tyrna get their cups filled up
With that juice that makes ya wanna 

[?]
Cause the mood is alright in here
Ladies ain’t been trippin’ at all
She’s been promising them draws gone fall
I might love you right in front of all ya'll
Cause its all my party, I can do what I want to

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Everybody’s with me

T. Cruise and Big Willy, Usher and P. Diddy
Denzel, Samuel tonight, tonight

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
By the time you get this letter
I might be doin' better
It's kinda hard trying to survive
In all this crazy weather
Everybody wants my number
Everybody's callin' my name
But in the midst of all of this
I can still hear you say

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Son, walk upright and straighten your tie
You don't want one of them good jobs to pass you by
Don't act no fool, I'm watching you
And now that you're gone
It still feels like you do, I wish

[Chorus]
I wish u were here
To see the things I've done
I wish u were here
You'd be so proud of your son
I wish u were here
To celebrate with me
I wish u were here

[Verse 2]
Now all of these people ask me
"Is it lonely at the top?"
Or do I find comfort
In all the things I got
Well, these cars keep me movin'
These planes keep me high
A million dollar home
But I'm barely gettin' by cause

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I miss our talks
One thing you used to say (used to say)
When things got hard (Hard on me)
Get down on your knees and pray
And then those walks (then those walks)
Its just the simple things
We still do all of this
But only in my dreams, I wish

[Chorus]
I wish u were here
To see the things I've done
I wish u were here
You'd be so proud of your son
I wish u were here
To celebrate with me
I wish u were here

[Bridge]
But sometimes I wonder why
Why can't you still be here wit me?
Wish God would've waited a couple more years for you to see
I'm tryna stay strong, barely holdin' on
I know I'll see you again
But for right now, rest in peace

And when I get to heaven
First thing they'll say to me
Tell me have you seen Estelle Marie Talley
Find out where you are, run into your arms
Wrap your wings around me
And whisper in my ear, "Well done"
Well, well done, my son, well done, well done, oh

[Chorus]
I wish u were here
To see the things I've done
I wish u were here
You'd be so proud of your son
I wish u were here
To celebrate with me
I wish u were here

Goodnight Dont Exist In ATL

MLK Bitch!

[Hook]
Look at tha flicka da wrist
Catchin' plays, catchin' play
I woke up feelin' like I was on the moon
I woke up feelin' like I need a hundred goons
Look at the flicka da wrist, look at the flicka da wrist
Look at the flicka da wrist, look at the flicka da wrist
Look at the flicka da wrist, look at the flicka da wrist
Look at the flicka da wrist, (Hustle Gang Nigga)

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Bust it up put it in a pot (Ahhh)
And then you heat that shit
Whoop it like a bitch
Till it lock off, and rock up
Let it dry, then repeat that shit
You ain't commin' out the boat
You can keep that shit
Trap fundamentals like I teach that shit
You all know em, You all suffer

[?], you catch a case
Shut your mouth you can beat that shit
Hall & Oates with the dope gang
Bankroll and the chain for the cocaine
Get you a little watch and a gold chain
And a Benz, but the shit
Can be in your name , nigga hold up
Digits on digits, and digital scales
Got bricks in the kitchen
They hittin' the shelves, nigga
Come in here trippin' we givin you shells
'Finna pay out my lawyer, no sittin' in jail
Praying for heaven, but givin' 'em hell
Ain't gonna stop until he get him a meal
The city his, he a big deal
Trapped everywhere, paranoid
Tryin' not to get killed
Moving Up and Down the Interstate
Trappin' hard dealing weight
2 rules in the Gang:
Nigga, Get Rich Get Away

[Hook]

[Hook]
I walk inside the club with a pocket full of guap
About to pop a bottle and hit my diddy bop
Shout out to the squad cause you know we on top
Shout out the the squad cause you know we don't stop
Ditty bop, ditty bop, ditty bop, ditty bop
Shout out to the squad cause you know we on top
Shout out the the squad cause you know we don't stop

[Verse 1]
Yo, I'm back at it again
And this one right is here top 10
Diddy boppin' in the club, you know I get it in
Ain't know how much that I spent
Wake up in the morn, do it again
Free all my homies out the pen
Yeah, you know that I'm the man
On my chain, it's yellow, a 100 grand
I don't gotta brag about the money
I can still swag without the money
I took off on the haters, they lookin' funny
Do not move but the money
You must think I'm a dummy
You know I'm gettin' money
My peers gettin' old
So I pulled up in a ghost
Eattin' shrimp and calamari
I might go buy me a Bugatti
My money fettuccine and my pockets on sloppy
I got girls in the lobby
I gotta get it, boy you playin'
I got the world in my hand
Boulevard 20 mil, pinky ring 20 grand
Do you dig what I sayin'?

[Hook]
I walk inside the club with a pocket full of guap
About to pop a bottle and hit my diddy bop
Shout out to the squad cause you know we on top
Shout out the the squad cause you know we don't stop
Ditty bop, ditty bop, ditty bop, ditty bop
Shout out to the squad cause you know we on top
Shout out the the squad cause you know we don't stop

[Verse 2]
You can't do it like me
So don't do it like me
I took your girlfriend, yeah, you know that she a freak
I can have a different girl every week
I be get it boppin' in my sleep
Gettin' money, tone heat
I take the Lamborghini and I swerve it through the streets
BT, SOD
I'm swaggin' out the loft and
I had to shake the hatters off me
And this my new dance
I might spend all of my advance
I'm chillin' up in France
Ditty boppin' with my mans
You can tell that I'm the man, you know I got a plan
She love the way I dance

[Hook]
I walk inside the club with a pocket full of guap
About to pop a bottle and hit my diddy bop

Ditty bop, ditty bop, ditty bop, ditty bop
Shout out to the squad cause you know we on top
Shout out the the squad cause you know we don't stop

[Verse 1]
I hope you remember me like this
Dancing in the stars in my sundress
I was just a dreamer, no stress
And battles lines became paradise next to you

[Verse 2]
You been working hard 9 to 5 and
I'm doing my part in tryin'
Just to make you smile and get happy
Like daddy used to say to me

[Chorus]
"When you're young and free
Stop and think of me"
Staying together is heaven when you look so good
And you taste so sweet
Never let me go
Boy hang on to me
Staying together forever it's heaven when you taste so sweet

[Outro]
When you're young and free

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Street lights, turn on one by one
My hope is, descending like the sun
Try to tell myself there's freedom in the loneliness (Oh baby)
Always restless, story of my life
Disconnected, body clock's not right
Try to tell myself that I'mma get some sleep tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Found myself where I started, this isn't where I want to be
The time that I find hardest, always comes eventually

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
My shadow doesn't show in the dark
The night time is inclined to my heart
The emptiness I felt from the start
Will follow me 'till I fall apart

[Refrain: The Weeknd]
Nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
My demons are blocking out the light
And my mind is about to lose the fight
Why can't I find peace, when a caracal could sleep tonight? (Yeah)
Your absence isn't something that I choose (choose, choose choose)
But the truth is you were never mine to lose (lose, lose, lose)
Spending half my life just tryna get away from you (Oh baby, oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Found myself where I started, this isn't where I want to be
The time that I find hardest, always comes eventually

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
My shadow doesn't show in the dark
The night time is inclined to my heart
The emptiness I felt from the start
Will follow me 'till I fall apart

[Refrain: The Weeknd]
Nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal
Nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal
Nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal
Nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal (Oh yeah)

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
My shadow doesn't show in the dark
The night time is inclined to my heart
The emptiness I felt from the start
Will follow me 'till I fall apart

[Refrain: The Weeknd]
Nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal
Nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal
Nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal
Nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal

[?]
Niggas say he got the sticky icky purp velcro

[?] through my mind
And I can't hide the feeling inside
I don't know how I feel like this but shit just got real like this
First you see my face in your magazine
You wanna rip it out, you wanna dream my dream
You wanna wear my clothes, you wanna feel my touch
You wanna take a ride, yeah, I'm a fashion slut
Because you can feel the heat when you touch the page
You wanna take a bite, you wanna play my games
But I don't play the game, the games that you play

Because I'm a lioness, you wanna hear my roar
But you took your shit before you go and score
You're not on my wavelength, although you'd like to be
I wish you'd go away, I wish that you could see
That you're not my type, you'll never get it right
You're not idealistic, you're just too uptight
You think your head's a mess but it's all pretend
Yeah, it's all pretend, yeah, it's all!

You think you're too cool but you're not
You think you're right but you're so wrong
You're pixilated, you're 

[?]
I found you in the black taxi
Watching your life on the TV screen
I know that's who you want to be, but you can't
Because that is me
You tried to steal my life, you took the lock and key
But after all that pain I know just who you've been
So stop your back-chat, screaming like a rich brat
Take off that gold and give me my reflection back
Because I can hear your voice imitating mine
And I can see your shoes, that they're across the line
Yeah, Imma wipe that smile right off your face
I don't want your tears because you're not 

[?]

You think you're too cool but you're not
You think you're right but you're so wrong
You're pixilated, you 

[?]
I found you in the black taxi
Watching your life on the TV screen
I know that's who you want to be, but you can't
Because that is me

You're a gameplayer, a fame-chaser
But that's what everyone is these days
Strumming acoustic guitar in the haze
Expressing yourself in different ways
But be careful, you'll get caught
(x2)

You think you're too cool but you're not
You think you're right but you'¢re so wrong
You're pixilated, you're 

[?]
I found you in the black taxi
Watching your life on the TV screen
I know that's who you want to be, but you can't
Because that's me

[Chorus: Toro Y Moi]
You left that night
My mouth is tight
Run to the highest ground
Don’t think that you won’t drown
You left that night
My mouth is tight
Run to the highest ground
Don’t think that you won’t drown

[Verse 1: Kool A.D.]
Poured up, game sewed
Rolled up, so blow, blowed up, so what?
Love how she filling up the low cut
And she’s sitting on bread like a cold cut
Got me spinning around like a donut
Haha, but like so what?
Show up, poured up, from the billfold, up
From the toes, up
Sold out, sewed up
Gold mouth, gold up
Showed up
Poured up, game sewed up
Rolled up, so blown
Blow up, so what?
Love how she filling up the low cut
And she’s sitting on bread like a cold cut
She got me spinning around and around like a donut
So what?, so what?

[Chorus: Toro Y Moi]
You left that night
My mouth is tight
Run to the highest ground
Don’t think that you won’t drown
You left that night
My mouth is tight
Run to the highest ground
Don’t think that you won’t drown

[Verse 2: SAFE]
I don’t remember; we started screaming
But it’s all right by me
Leave me out of your pictures
Ruffle my feathers, you tip my drink
But it's hard times
I got my cigarettes and coffee in the morning
Warning you, I love the hard knocks
Long nights, I slow cook a gold ring finger
Half crook, I tried but not true
Equal parts kid leather and rabbit glue
It's waterfalls and candy apples
No, I don't like those at all
But I'm doing you the best you know the moral
While we crawl, drunk at the riot
Baby you should just try it, show up next to me
I expect that you believe in the best of me
Last night, I dreamt I was a drunk from a pilot, yes I heard a freak
I don't remember the questions you asked me
The whole world was lying, my face is a mess, but I'm trying

[Outro: Kool A.D.]
So what?, show up
So what?, show up

[Verse]
I should have it all now
I don’t mind even how
Ooh, girl, when you call me
Just let me know you down to fall in love
Us two, cooped up
Driving down the one

I should have it all now
I don’t mind even how
Ooh, girl, when you call me
Just let me know you down to fall in love
Us two, cooped up
Driving down the one

Look at the flick of the wrist, I put the dick in your bitch

Remember them times they never was on us

She ain't down, I bet I fuck
Legend to these basic bitches, basic hoes I never touch
Tell them bitches back back out the VIP don't let them know
It don't matter if it's Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday bet I clutch
You be liking all her pictures, I hit that ain't never bust
Used to pray get that pussy, I got that and never cuffed
She got mad I hit her friend
I don't argue, let her fuss
It ain't shit to cut that bitch off and move on to better stuff
I got different color Balenciagas
I switch kicks like Mr. Rogers
Bitch better have my money, don't give a fuck if it was fifty dollars
Hit the club, you mobbed up
Mobbed up with fifty cowards
I hit the club, we all strapped
Just four niggas that get them dollars like hey

She wanna go, smell the weed all in my clothes
Fuck her, don't need her no more
Six in a row, get a bitch, give her the bone
Break her like six in them stones
Niggas so cold, thinking I sit in the snow
I keep a bitch getting stoned
Smoke in my home, all my whips covered in chrome
All my dips love giving dome
Get it to go, back to my crib stuffing cones
Y'all either kids or my clones
We turnt up on marijuana and champagne
Them niggas talk ‘bout who they are, but they don’t do a thing
Can't tell me I ain't drunk I'm on that water in the club
Different strokes, find me a bitch I can poke
I'mma go get me an "O" and

Go straight to the brain, your shit ain't the same
A different lane, we sipping champagne
I been in the game, just give me a flame
She looking for change, I'm rolling up Jane
I'm balling insane, got more than six rings
In love with my slang, I'm puffing a J
I hunt her today, come up with a play
Most of these niggas be wanting to cuff on a bitch
I just be up in the way, stuff in the safe
I'm loving the race, stuck in first place
Fuck her for days
Them niggas wanna talk about it but they don't wanna roll
What it takes to be a real G, they don't even know
I go to her page, she come to my place
It look like a maze, we roll up a plane
She look at my change, she start giving brain
If they ain't the gang, then we ain't the same

[Chorus]

Got a bitch I'ma call when I'm tryna fuck
You ain't shit to the God, need to get you a job
'Cause you live in the mall, bills pile up
I'ma chill in the spot with a spliff, I been lifted a lot
But I still ain't high enough
All the mills that I got, couple whips in the lot
There's a list to the top, you could sign me up
(Yeah) You could sign me up
Sign me up
They can't bring me down, can't hold me down, can't bring me down
Sign me up
Can't burn me down, can't hold me down, can't bring me down with you
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Above ground, 'bout thirty thou' miles up
Tell the bitch, "Slow down," like dial-up
She go down first and she climbin' up
Wanna let me cut, tell her, "Line it up"
Little bit much, I'm a wild one (Woo)
All I do is fuck hoes, drink tiger blood (Yummy)
Since I came in the game, they been sour
I'm the plug, get your motherfuckin' power up
Mind your business (You in my office)
And I go get it (I need all it)
I stay lifted, smokin', sippin'
Fixes fixin' all my problems (Yeah)

[Chorus]
I done been through it all, every brick in the wall
Got a bitch I'ma call when I'm tryna fuck
You ain't shit to the God, need to get you a job
'Cause you live in the mall, bills pile up
I'ma chill in the spot with a spliff, I been lifted a lot
But I still ain't high enough
All the mills that I got, couple whips in the lot
There's a list to the top, you could sign me up

[Verse 2]
I was a nobody, now my name's on the list
Couple ki's of uncut cocaine on the wrist
And I let my nuts hang on a bitch
All the money that we spend on champagne is ridiculous
And it is us, elixir in my cup
Give the bitches drugs, a dick to suck
And I don't see why these kids wanna grow up to be just like me (Yeah)
I was a nobody, now my name in they mouth
I came for a steak, but I left with the cow
And they hate when you great though
Ain't shit change but my checkin' account (Mac Milly)

[Chorus]
I done been through it all, every brick in the wall
Got a bitch I'ma call when I'm tryna fuck
You ain't shit to the God, need to get you a job

But I still ain't high enough
All the mills that I got, couple whips in the lot
There's a list to the top, you could sign me up

Sign me up
They can't bring me down, can't hold me down, can't bring me down

They can't bring me down, can't bring me down, can't bring me down with you
Ca—, you ca—, ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-can't bring me down

[Verse 1]
Everybody's hand in hand
Swingin' down the lane
Everybody's feelin' grand
Swingin' down the lane

[Verse 2]
That's the time I miss the bliss
That we might have known
Nights like this
When I'm all alone

[Pre-Chorus]
When the moon is on the rise
Baby, I'm so blue
Watchin' lovers makin' eyes
Like we used to do

[Chorus]
When the moon is on the way
Still I'm waitin' all in vain
Should be swingin' down the lane
With you

[Pre-Chorus]
When the moon is on the rise
Baby, I'm so blue
Watchin' lovers makin' eyes
Like we used to do

[Chorus]
When the moon is on the way
Still I'm waitin' all in vain
Should be swingin' down the lane
With you
I took a trip on a train
And I thought about you
I passed a shadowy lane
And I thought about you

Two or three cars parked under the stars
Winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream

And every stop that we made
Oh, I thought about you
And when I pulled down the shade
Then I really felt blue

I peeped through the crack
Looked at the track
Oh I'm going back to you
And what did I do? I thought about you

There were two or three cars parked under the stars
Winding stream
Moon shining down on some little town
And with each beam, the same old dream
And then I peeped through the crack
And looked at the track
Oh I'm going back to you
And what did I do? I thought about you

[Chorus]
In olden days a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking
Now heaven knows, anything goes

[Verse 1]
Good authors too who once knew better words
Now only use four letter words writing prose, anything goes

[Verse 2]
The world has gone mad today and good's bad today
And black's white today and day's night today
When most guys today that women prize today
Are just silly gigolos

[Pre-Chorus]
So though I'm not a great romancer
I know that you're bound to answer
When I propose, anything goes

[Chorus]
In olden days a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking
Now heaven knows, anything goes

[Verse 3]
And good authors too who once knew better words
Now only use four letter words writing prose
Cause anything goes

[Verse 4]
The world has gone mad today and good's bad today
And black's white today and day's night today
When most guys today that women prize today
Are just silly gigolos

[Pre-Chorus]
So though I'm not a great romancer
I know that you're bound to answer
When I propose, anything goes

[Outro]
May I say before this record spins to a close
I want you to know anything goes

[Chorus]
Another bride, another June
Another sunny honeymoon
Another season, another reason
For makin' whoopee

[Verse 1]
A lot of shoes, a lot of rice
The groom is nervous, he answers twice
It's really killin' that he's so willin'
To make whoopee

[Verse 2]
Picture a little love nest
Down where the roses cling
Picture the same sweet love nest
And think what a year can bring

[Pre-Chorus]
He's washin' dishes and baby clothes
He's so ambitious, he even sews
But don't forget folks, that's what you get folks
For makin' whoopee

[Chorus]
Another bride, another June
Another sunny, a sunny honeymoon
Another reason is that season
For makin' whoopee

[Verse 3]
A mess of shoes, a gang of rice
The groom is nervous that he answers twice
It's really killin' this cat so willin'
To make whoopee

[Outro]
Now he's washin' dishes with those baby clothes
He's so ambitious, man, he even sews
But don't forget folks, that's what you get folks
For makin' whoopee

But don't forget folks, that's what you get folks
For makin' whoopee

Ride out, back door, black tint, beat me there, don't meet me there
You and your girl need to fuck with a G but no social media
Leave your purse and your phone at the door on the low
Ain't no social media (tell 'em Wiz)

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Girl I'm tryna fuck with you with no social media
Take you to a private place with no social media
Girl you look so good when you got no social media
Bring my friends, you bring some too just no social media

[Outro: Wiz Khalifa]
Oh no-oh-woah, oh no-oh-woah
Let's do this on the low-oh-woah, yeah
Oh no-oh-woah, oh no-oh-woah
Let's do this on the low-oh-woah, yeah
Oh no-oh-woah, oh no-oh-woah
Let's do this on the low-oh-woah, yeah
Oh no-oh-woah, oh no-oh-woah
Let's do this on the low-oh-woah, yeah

[Hook x2]
In the street's it's getting hot
And the youths dem a get so cold
Searching for food for the pot
They'll do anything to fill that gap

[Verse 1]
The most lyrical comprehensional Soulja Boy Tell'Em I'm three dimensional
My swagger's off the fucking chain
I am not no fucking lame
Off the top of my fucking brain
I go hard on this track mane
Soulja Tell'Em mane, my motherfucking wrist same color as a damn taxi
Nigga don't ask me or grab me, harass me
You fuck niggas flash me, your task bitch
Soulja Tell'Em I'm back on the track again (track again)
What's hannenin (what's hannenin)
What's hannenin what's hannenin what's popping and what's stopping him
What's stopping him? Nothing
Cause I'm on deck like your motherfucking bitch on my dick
With her lips and she sucking sucking suck and suck I bust (bow)
Bow
Soulja Boy Tell'Em make you bust now
I'm on deck
And you already know that my chain look just like snow

[Hook x2]
In the street's it's getting hot
And the youths dem a get so cold
Searching for food for the pot
They'll do anything to fill that gap

[Verse 2]
Do you see how my watch glistening?
Or do you see how this black teeth fit in?
Damn I'm fixing to rip this them grips so hard I'm off my feet like I'm flying
Flyer than a motherfucking island
And I got your bitch smiling, she wiling
I did-her-did-her-did-her down good
Up in my hotel suite I'm like George Bush
Soulja Boy Tell'Em, Soulja Boy Tell'Em
Soulja Boy, are you listening?
Bitch quit hissing, I can see you
But you can't see me
Soulja Boy Tell'Em I'm a fucking fool
So much swag and I'm super cool
Who the fuck are you? Get the fuck away from me
Or my goons might go ahead and sprain you, B

[Hook x2]
In the street's it's getting hot
And the youths dem a get so cold
Searching for food for the pot
They'll do anything to fill that gap

[Outro]
I'm the shit, mane
I'm the shit, bitch

I'm the shit
I'm the shit, bitch

[Verse 1: Prince]
Closed over, day done
New day is dawning and the fun has just begun
Onto the next Generation X
Didn't leave me nothing and nobody to respect
Looking to be proud, dirty projects
Hoping, hungry, feed my stomach
Y'all can see my mom's chest

[Pre-Chorus: Prince]
I come from north Minny
And I never run from any
And I ain't about to stop right now

[Chorus: Prince & Rita Ora]
If your life is a B-side, my dream is the A
I got a rockstar, celebration cannot drink away
I come from North Minny
And I never run from many
And I ain't about to stop right now
Ain't about to stop, ain't about to stop
Ain't about to stop, and I ain't about to stop right now
Ain't about to stop, ain't about to stop
Ain't about to stop right now

[Verse 2: Rita Ora]
Low class, in the past
From the bottom up, we gettin' rough and kickin' ass
Never fail, cause see these females
We still gotta little bit of dirt underneath these hundred dollar nails
Latest fashion, once I get the cash in
Nothing is too good for Rita if she got the passion

[Pre-Chorus: Prince]
I come from North Minny
And I never run from any
And I ain't about to stop right now

[Chorus: Prince & Rita Ora]
If your life is a B-side, my dream is the A
I got a rockstar, celebration cannot drink away
I come from north Minny
And I never run from many
And I ain't about to stop right now
Ain't about to stop, ain't about to stop
Ain't about to stop, and I ain't about to stop right now
Ain't about to stop, ain't about to stop
Ain't about to stop right now

[Bridge: Prince & Rita Ora]
If you're not a Ritabot, you're a blood clot
If you're not a Ritabot, you're a blood clot
If you're not a Ritabot, you're a blood clot
If you're not a Ritabot, Ritabot, Ritabot

[Outro: Prince & Rita Ora]
Woo, woo-woo
Woo, woo-woo
Woo, woo-woo
Woo, woo-woo
Ain't about to stop, ain't about to stop
Ain't about to stop
Ain't about to stop
Ain't about to stop
Ain't about to stop right now
Pick out my clothes

[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah
Should probably start drinkin' more water

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I was
Sittin' in the basement, I just need a little motivation
Or a vacation, maybe just a little bit of patience
Made a couple million, what the fuck I'm still waitin' for?
This American hallucination, yeah
Wake up this American hallucination
Well, I feel liberated, fuck feelin' famous
Especially when you don't fuck with how the picture painted
Livin' in the matrix, digital ages
Can't believe this shit that everybody get away with
Yeah, and you call this shit sacred, yeah
Well, the opinion unpopular
Sittin' here zonin' to the image on the monitor
Young piece of shit, I'm from the 'Burgh though
Shadow Lounge birthed the legend, no award show needed
But I can tell you what the kids like
Feelin' when you little but the feelin' really big like
No, I never been the bitch type
Always down to give a little insight, yeah
I put it all in the music and live life
Hopin' that I did it right
Put it all in the music and live life
Fucked up, self destruct, that's kryptonite
We already move that dope
'Bout time to hit the road, go and do them shows
Get yourself a real woman, go and lose them hoes
Little chicken noodle soup for the soul

[Chorus]
Yeah, it's all good
6:30 in the mornin'
And, it's all good
6:30 in the mornin'
Wake up, it's all good
6:30 in the mornin'
And it's, all good

[Verse 2]
Yeah
I am who I hate, but fuck that
Gettin' throat, she'll never know if I come back
Shit was all good when I loved rap
When they had me screamin', "Where the drugs at?"
Yeah, the most hated, all I know is greatness
Home runs, laps round the bases
Have a little fun, make faces
Make money, make changes

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, live from the Waldorf in Berlin
Coming at you once again
With stories of truth and stories of sin
Yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, the ball is in your court
No defense, nobody's keeping score
No offense but I've played this before
Maybe you can and you just don't care anymore
Evolving
Evolving
Evolving
Yeah
And I’m right back here when I said I wouldn't
You were never a good girl but you're a better woman now
Evolving
Evolving
Evolving, evolving
Look, you remind me of Jane Birkin, your body insane in person
Wanna do special things for you, you deserve it
But you're too famous to buy you purses
That barely scratches the surface
This time is different, you give me purpose
Tell me you taking it serious, I gotta ask how serious?
'Cause your serious has just been not that serious
Got me on tour acting like I'm not that curious
Ignoring all the pussy that's thrown at me
Been thinking 'bout home actually
Where Roxx has Kim and Mark has Ashley and Niks has Ezee
And I, I don’t even know what I have anymore
Evolving
Evolving
Evolving
Evolving
E...

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
We are not the same I am too reckless
I'm not tryna go in that direction
These niggas they been doing too much flexing
And they're about to call the wrong attention
And I ain't got no patience, no more testing
I do shit how I want, don't need no blessing
XO niggas ain't nothing to mess with
Nobody stopping us, oh no we're destined
And everybody around you is so basic
I'm never rocking white, I'm like a racist
I don't drink my liquor with a chasin'
And money is the only thing I'm chasin'
And some dope dimes on some coke lines
Give me head all night, cum four times
Baby girl just wanna smoke a pound
Do an ounce, get some dick
Tell her friends about it

[Hook: The Weeknd]
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell them what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I did it on the low
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell them what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be off that coke
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill

[Verse 3: The Weeknd]
Last year I did all the politicin'
This year I'm all focused on the vision
I think these hoes deserve another fixing
I'm talking about the ones from the beginning
Don't believe the rumours bitch, I'm still a user
I'm still rocking camo and still roll with shooters
I'm a villain in my city, I just made another killing
I'mma spend it all on bitches
And everybody fuckin, everybody fucking
Pussy on the house, everybody fucking
And I miss my city man it's been a minute
M.I.A. a habit, Cali was the mission
Cruise through the west-end in my new Benz
I'm just tryna live life through a new lens
Driving by the streets I used to walk through
When I had no crib I guess you call that shit a miracle

[Hook: The Weeknd]
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell them what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be on the low
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singing 'bout popping pills, fucking bitches, living life so trill

[Verse 4: The Weeknd]
My cousin said I made it big and it's unusual
She tried to take a selfie at my Grandma's funeral
Used to roam on Queen, now I sing Queen street anthems
Used to hate attention, now I pull up in that wagon
I was broken, I was broken, I was so broke
I used to roam around the town when I was homeless
Me and Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans
And flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix
Now we get faded, when we want girl, we got choices
Lay them on the fucking table, we got choices
And if they wanna fuck my niggas, they got choices
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
It's only meant to fall in love
That shit is pointless

[Hook: The Weeknd]
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell them what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be off that coke
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singing 'bout popping pills, fucking bitches, living life so trill
Life so trill
Life so trill
Life so trill

[Chorus]
Bug in the crosshair
Bug in the crosshair

Cause you take me higher, now baby 3, 2, 1, let's go

[Pre-Hook]
I got a house but I want a home
I got a heart but it's full of stone
What they say is true people loan
But don't nobody know what's going on

[Hook]
What's missing is you babe (You babe)
You babe

[Hook]
What's missing is you babe (You babe)
You babe
What's missing is you babe
I'm bout to put your face upon the milk carton

[Intro]
From the movements you made
And the soft gaze you gave
You understood
Ooh, ooh

And I knew it wouldn't last
But in the clean light you cast
I was good
I was good

[Hook]
From the movements you made
And the soft gaze you gave
You understood
Ooh, ooh

And I knew it wouldn't last
But in the clean light you cast
I was good
I was good

[Verse]
And no matter what I do, I know you got me, girl

[Hook]
From the movements you made
And the soft gaze you gave
You understood
Ooh, ooh

And I knew it wouldn't last
But in the clean light you cast
I was good
I was good

[Bridge]
All the years my soul, all the things you thought I did
This soulless kid was under all my skin
All the things I tried to say remain within
I'm cooling in the clay
I've always been molded this way
All the years my soul, all the things you thought I did
This soulless kid was under all my skin
All the things I tried to say remain within
I'm cooling in the clay
I've always been molded this way

[Hook and Bridge Simultaneously]

[Bridge]
All the years my soul, all the things you thought I did
This soulless kid was under all my skin
All the things I tried to say remain within
I'm cooling in the clay
I've always been molded this way
All the years my soul, all the things you thought I did
This soulless kid was under all my skin
All the things I tried to say remain within
I'm cooling in the clay
I've always been molded this way

[Verse]
Are you falling through?
Are you falling through?
Don't let it leak out now
You've got to make it through
The photos in your hands
In your box of youth
It's not different now
Than it'll ever be
You've got to trust me
You've got to trust me

[Refrain]
Don't you worry ‘bout us losing everyone
Cause I'll reach you and we'll go out on the pond
And we'll get stuck in the middle of it all with a dead pontoon
I don't think I have enough batteries

[Outro]
It won’t be long
Till we'll all go back
To our open locks
And our biggest cities
It won't be long
Till we all go back
To our open locks
And our biggest cities
(It won't be long)

[Verse 1]
It's like a thousand trumpets Spottieottiedopa-dopa-liscious
It's like a million bass drums beating out bum-ba-baby-bum-bum
It's like the voice of angels, not too fast and not too slow
Hi-hats humming happiness, where my passion is
Now that's the sound of my soul
The MC orchestra going Bone Thugs all on the track, ah, ah huh
It's some of Aunt Nancy's voice in New York every time I come back
If Jimmy Paige would've played in a group with Snoop and it came out dope
Little this, little that, this is that, get the gat, do the track

[Chorus]
Now that's the sound of my soul
That's the sound of my soul
That's the sound of my soul
Baby, it sounds like love
So listen close to my soul
That's the sound of my soul

[Verse 2]
A little of my mom mixed up doing harmony over my pop's
I feel a lil' Piccolo player, she's echoing off of tree tops
A little J. Dilla, a little Sam Cook, that's when you sing in high notes

[Chorus]
That's the sound of my soul
That's the sound of my soul
That's the sound of my soul
Baby, it sounds like love
So listen close to my soul
That's the sound of my soul
(To the bridge)

[Bridge]
I could do anything I want to
My gift is my song, for you
Rumbling halos in this
If the universe had a singing voice
It would ride the beat like this
Like what?
Like this
Like what?
Like this
Like what?

[Chorus]
That's the sound of my soul
That's the sound of my soul
That's the sound of my soul
Baby, it sounds like love
So listen close to my soul
That's the sound of my soul

[Verse 1]
I've been here before
But always hit the floor
I've spent a lifetime runnin'
And I always get away
But with you I'm feeling something
That makes me want to stay

[Verse 2]
I'm prepared for this
I never shoot to miss
But I feel like a storm is coming
If I'm gonna make it through the day
Then there's no more use in runnin'
This is something I gotta face

[Pre-Chorus]
If I risk it all
Could you break my fall?

[Chorus]
How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here, I'm suffocating
I wanna feel love run through my blood
Tell me, is this where I give it all up?
For you, I have to risk it all
'Cause the writing's on the wall

[Verse 3]
A million shards of glass
That haunt me from my past
As the stars begin to gather
And the light begins to fade
When all hope begins to shatter
Know that I won't be afraid

[Pre-Chorus]
If I risk it all
Could you break my fall?

[Chorus]
How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here, I'm suffocating
I wanna feel love run through my blood
Tell me, is this where I give it all up?
For you, I have to risk it all
'Cause the writing's on the wall

[Bridge]
The writing's on the wall

[Chorus]
How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here, I'm suffocating
I wanna feel love run through my blood
Tell me, is this where I give it all up?
How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here, I'm suffocating
I wanna feel love run through my blood
Tell me, is this where I give it all up?
For you, I have to risk it all
'Cause the writing's on the wall

I don't have an ego, but my money do, money do
And I don't have a big mouth, but my money do, my money do
And I don't like to show out, but my money do, my money do
I got so many zeroes I could bury you its Gucci
I don't have an ego, but my money do ,my money do
And I don't have a big mouth, but my money do,my money do
And I don't like to show out, but my money do,my money do
I got so many zeroes I could bury you, waoh

[Verse 1]
Call that ballin', I call that hopscotch
He gettin' a little cash, but he ain't got what I got
Twenties in my bankroll, 150 on my watch
Like Dikembe Mutombo, get a lot of them big blocks
Gucci brought them bands out
You brought a lil' cash out
Our sets, they poke out
Interior smoked out
Homie you a peon
I'm ridin' European
Emmitt Smith on the back tire
But the front tire's a Deion
Get this shit for the 17
Sell shit for the Keyshawn
My wrist colder than freon
That bullshit, I be on
In the club, I'm wasted
Better yet, I'm faded
Got home, don't know how I made it
But this shit all gravy

[Hook]
I don't have an ego, but my money do, my money do
And I don't have a big mouth, but my money do, my money do
And I don't like to show out, but my money do, my money do
I got so many zeroes I could bury you its Gucci
I don't have an ego, but my money do, my money do
And I don't have a big mouth, but my money do, my money do
And I don't like to show out, but my money do, my money do
I got so many zeroes I could bury you, waoh

[Verse 2]
When I'm pickin' up weight I need a personal trainer
My money got its own fuckin' personal trainer
I'm in the club throwin' hundons
Smokin' out an onion
Garlic bread, inside paint like lasagna
Gucci be fresh like first day of school (Gucci!)
Diamonds drippin' wet, it's like they pushed me in the pool
Makin' paper airplanes out of hundreds, what I do
Passin' Ace of Spades like it's bottled water to the crew
Brick Squad, nigga!
Excuse me
Let me introduce myself, they call me Gucci
And all my kicks, they be the flyest, call me Bruce Lee
And I don't talk, my money do the talkin' usually
I'm super chillin', but my money be the rudest

[Hook]
I don't have an ego, but my money do ,my money do
And I don't have a big mouth, but my money do, my money do
And I don't like to show out, but my money do, my money do
I got so many zeroes I could bury you, Its Gucci
I don't have an ego, but my money do, my money do
And I don't have a big mouth, but my money do, my money do
And I don't like to show out, but my money do, my money do
I got so many zeroes I could bury you, waoh it Gucci
I don't have an ego, but my money do, my money do
And I don't have a big mouth, but my money do, my money do
And I don't like to show out, but my money do, my money do
I got so many zeroes I could bury you, its Gucci
I don't have an ego, but my money do, my money do
And I don't have a big mouth, but my money do, my money do
And I don't like to show out, but my money do, my money do
I got so many zeroes I could bury you , waoh its Gucci

[Verse]
(I've been on the, I've been on the)
I've been on the run, that's why I go harder than you go
Plus I call 'em how I see em, maybe that's why I'm all alone
Product of the cold but let me back up
The bitch back arched like a bow, yes sir
Leave her eyes in between her thighs, wetter
I told you that I'm in it for the long stretcher
I thought I told you I was in it for the long stretch
Drunk off of liquor from the long neck bottle
Mama told me that her soul been hollow for the longest
I told her that I know those problems
But you gotta know that wallowing is chosen
I scraped my face off the bottom one time, now mama son shine
Like the mother fucking blinds when they open
Ashes to Ashes, pray death kiss my opponent
Had scars on my fist when I rose it
Armed with intent to provoke in a moment
Not be nutrition for vultures
Armor too thick for the poking
Think before you approach me, bitch

[Hook]
It's 6 in the morning
You live around the corner
It's hard in the city, I'm falling, I'm sickened
The piggy's approaching, clicking the cuffs on the 40s
Chickens get slip and get sold
Live or you don’t
Do what you do for your family but most handle yourself
Know your daddy got goals
Be a man and just get with some shit you were planning

[Chorus]
Homie, you's a window shopper
Mad at me, I think I know why
Homie, you's a window shopper
In the jewelry store lookin' at shit you can't buy
Homie, you's a window shopper
At the dealership, tryna get a test drive
Homie, you's a window shopper
You mad as fuck when you see me ride by

[Verse]
Everybody wanna talk shit on the internet
But they ain't understand they see the work I put into it
I'm guessing all this bullshit just come with the benefits
20 years old, 20 carats, my bezel heavy
Doors suicide, they say a word in remembrance
And they just wanna see me fail but dawg, I ain't havin' it
They wanna tear me down and tell you, "Youngin', you can't handle it"
And I'm just here to tell 'em that their shit never happenin'
And I just flew by in a drop-top Porsche
Givenchy swim shorts like I hopped out the pool
Flu game Post, people callin' me the G.O.A.T
People gettin' heated, shit my Rollie still cold
Ayy-ayy-ayy
I got cha-ayy-ayy-ange
Why you even lookin'? You ain't pay-ayy-in'
I'm still loyal what the fuck is y'all sayin'?
Even though my song stuck in your bitch brain

[Chorus]
Homie, you's a window shopper
Mad at me, I think I know why
Homie, you's a window shopper
In the jewelry store lookin' at shit you can't buy
Homie, you's a window shopper
At the dealership, tryna get a test drive
Homie, you's a window shopper
Mad as fuck when you see me ride by

[Verse]
Wanna talk shit on, shit on the net
But they ain't understand they see the work I, work I put into it
I'm guessing all this bullshit just come with, come with the 'fits
20 years old, 20 carats, carats my heavy
Door's suicide, they say a word in, word in remembrance
And they just wanna see me fail but dawg, I, dawg I ain't it
They wanna tear me down and tell you, "Youngin', youngin' can't it"
And I'm just here to tell 'em that their shit never, never happenin'
Ayy-ayy, ride in a drop-top Porsche
Givenchy swim shorts like I hopped out the pool
Flu game Post, people callin', callin' G.O.A.T
People gettin' heated, shit my Rollie's, Rollie's cold
Ayy-ayy-ayy
I got cha-ayy-ayy-ange
Why you even lookin', lookin'? Pay-ayy-in'
I'm still loyal, loyal, fuck is y'all sayin'?
Even though my song stuck in your bitch brain

[Chorus]
Lord, my Lord
I need your helpin' hand

[Verse 1]
I'm in love
With a woman
Who's in love
With a man
That I can't be
It ain't me

[Verse 2]
I was taught
To be patient
And I was taught
To be kind
But I unwind

[Chorus]
Lord, my Lord
I need your helpin' hand

[Verse 3]
I worked
Long hours
Now I'm drunk
And I'm stoned
I'm all alone
Miles from home

[Chorus]
Lord, my Lord
I need your helpin' hand

[Chorus]
Lord, my Lord
I need your helpin' hand

[Hook: Timbaland & Future]
I think my girl might be cheating on the low
She say she need her space and she say she need to go
Oh man, I think my girl might be cheating on the low
I really hate to say it, but tonight I need to know
Need to know, are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
Are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
Are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
Are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
I think my girl might be cheating, UFO, UFO

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
She say she want somebody she can talk to
I always say I will but I never do
She says she need somebody she can count on
And when she dial my number, I don't pick it up
Alright, alright, girl, now I gotta catch my flight
Alright, alright, girl, I can't be that somebody every day
She say she';; find somebody if it ain't me
And I'm getting the feeling that she finna creep
(Boy give me a call back) That's what the message said
That shit stuck in my head, she said I never did
(Boy give me a call back) She could be in his arms
She 'bout to break my heart, she 'bout to break my heart

[Hook: Timbaland & Future]
I think my girl might be cheating on the low
She say she need her space and she say she need to go
Oh man, I think my girl might be cheating on the low
I really hate to say it, but tonight I need to know
Need to know, are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
Are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
Are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
Are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
I think my girl might be cheating, UFO, UFO

[Verse 2: Tink]
He could be alone with a dancer
Hear it in his tone when he answer
Four or five hoes in a week
But if I go out to cheat then I have no standards
Fuck that, tonight I'mma live
Find me someone in these streets
Freak on him slowly and not feel emotion
Cause he would do the same to me, no doubt
So I'mma get even, I never believe him, you telling me a lie
I'mma get busy and find me a nigga to lay with tonight
Pimpin' ain't nothing but game (game)
Treat all these hoes the same (same)
Niggas and women, we all lie about how we living
We all lie about where we staying
We all lie about who we laying, we all do
We all lie about who we cuffing
We all lie about who we fucking, we all do
Baby don't worry about me, I be on the run like Bey
You ain't gotta hide your face
'Cause I'm probably in the room right next to your suite

[Verse 3: Future]
Where your heart went? You must lost it in a coffin, hey-ey-ey
I'm smoking, taking me loses, I can't cry about you, no way-ay-ay
I'm a playa but it caught me off guard, I'mma say-ay-ay
Bitches don’t cheat on niggas this rich, bitch, you must be a misfit
I'm drinking, fucking my kidney, you got my going ballistic
Don't tell me you kissing niggas with my favorite lipstick
Not my bitch
Mamacita, no love lost, used to moving them drugs off
When a nigga he-a serve you
They come back and run up in your drug house
You lying bitch, who you lying to, tell me who you lying to
You rather taint my impression, how I look at you, how I honor you
We spent days up, I'm just thinking, did you get laid up?
Talking and conversating, hoping you tell me the truth
I thought I was bulletproof, until I found out a clue
You might be fucking him and him
And every brother around this bitch
I never knew until I thought I knew
He can't fuck you like me anyway, you must be getting back at me
Maybe my mind's playing tricks on me
I'm feeling guilty cause these hoes on me

[Hook: Timbaland & Future]
I think my girl might be cheating on the low
She say she need her space and she say she need to go
Oh man, I think my girl might be cheating on the low
I really hate to say it, but tonight I need to know
Need to know, are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
Are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
Are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
Are you fucking other niggas? UFO, UFO
I think my girl ‘bout to take the UFO

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
You know once upon a time, not long ago
There was a caterpillar that lived life slow
And a couple inches he stood
And he said to the butterfly, "What's good?"
And the butterfly told him one day he gon' make him rich
And then they said something else
I don't remember what they said
But I think it was something like the lines of:

Wesley's Theory:

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
When I get signed, homie, I'mma act a fool
Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
Snatch your little secretary thing for the homies
Blue-eyed devil with a fat old monkey
I'mma buy a brand new Caddy on fours
Trunk the hood up, two times, deuce-four
Platinum on everything, platinum on wedding ring
Married to the game and a bad thing chose
When I get signed, homie, I'ma buy a strap
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass them all out on the block, what's good?
I'mma put the Compton swap meet by the White House
Republican run up, get socked out
Hit the Pres with a Cuban link on my neck
Uneducated, but I got a million-dollar check hold on

[Pre-Hook: Kendrick Lamar & Thundercat]
We should've never gave
We should've never gave brothers
Money go back home, money go back home
We should've never gave
We should've never gave brothers, money go back home, money go back home

Momma:

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
This feeling is unmatched
This feeling is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap
Black Pendleton ball cap
We don't share the same synonym, fall back
Been in it before internet had new acts
Mimicking radio's nemesis made me wack
My innocence limited the experience lacked
Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
The mind of a literate writer, but I did it in fact
You admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plastic
Remember scribbling scratching diligent sentences backwards
Visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction

[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar (Anna Wise)]
(K.Dot!) Oh, what's going on?
(Something's on my mind) I think something on my mind, too
(I think it's about that time) I think it's about that time
(Put a little pimping in my pocket) Hit me!
King Kunta:

[Intro 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I got a bone to pick, uh
I don't want you monkey-mouth... sitting in my throne again
(Hold up)
I'm mad (he mad!), but I ain't stressing, noo
True friends, one question

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me, where you when I was walking?
Now I run the game, whole world talking, King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, Kunta
Black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Tell me where you when I was walking?
Now I run the game, whole world talking, King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & (Anna Wise)]
When you got the yams (What's the yams?)
The yam is the power that be, be, be, be, be
You can smell it when I'm walking down the street
(Oh yes we can, oh yes we can)
I can dig rappin', wait!
But a rapper with a ghost writer, tell me what happened to you?
(Oh no!)
No, I swore I wouldn't tell
But most of y'all sharing bars like you got the bottom bunk in a two man cell (A two man cell?)
Something's in the water (Something's in the water)
And if I gotta brown nose for some gold
Then I'd rather be a bum than a dumb, dumb baller

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me, where were you when I was walking?
Now I run the game got the whole world talking, King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, Kunta
Black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Tell me where were you when I was walking?
Now I run the game, whole world talking, King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar (Anna Wise)]
When you got the yams... (What's the yams?)
The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor, R.I.P.
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires, hol' up
24/7, 365 days times two, I was contemplating getting on stage
Go back to the hood, see my enemy and say

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me, where were you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game got the whole world talkin', King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him, Kunta
Black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Tell me where were you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, whole world talkin', King Kunta
Everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams... (What's the yams?)

[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
(You goat-mouth, mammy f-)
I was gonna kill a couple rappers but they did it to themselves
Body suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
Shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Flag in my city, everybody's screaming "Compton!"
Probably run for Mayor when I'm done, to be honest
Put that on my Mama and my baby boo, too
(Twenty million walkin' out the court building, woo woo!)

u:

[Verse 6: Kendrick Lamar]
Aahh, aahh, aahh!
I place blame on you still, place shame on you still
Feel like you ain't it, feel like you don't feel
Confidence in yourself, breaking on marble floors
Watching anonymous strangers, telling me that I'm yours
But you ain't it, I'm convinced your tolerance nothing special
What can I blame you for, I can name several
Situations, I'll start with your little sister baking
A baby inside, just a teenager, where your patience?
What was your influence, where was the influence you speak of?
You preached in front of 100,000 but never reached her
I tell you, you damn failure — you ain't no leader!
I never liked you, forever despise you — I don't need you!
The world don't need you, don't let them deceive you
Numbers lie too, buck your pride too, that's for dedication
Thought money would change you, made you more complacent
I hate you, I hope you embrace it
I swear

[Hook 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Loving you is complicated, loving you is -mplicated
Loving you is compli-, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated, loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you, not loving you, one hundred proof

[Bridge]
(I can feel your body recognize that you're ashamed of me)
You're afraid of me
(Yes I hate you too)
Yes I

[Outro]
When you look in my eyes
Tell me there's more inside
Tell me you're feeling high
Tell me you're here tonight
Tell me you hear my pain
Hear my soul, how you feeling?
Now you know
If you see it, if you would, God
Now get the gold, yeah!
Wooh!

[Verse 1]
There's someone out there waitin' for me
High, mini, fat, skinny, just wait and see
Don't call me lonely if you are too
In a big city, take pity, won't make the news
I'm advancing, nothing to lose
Go-getter, do better, the right attitude
Do as I say, not as I do
Got no money, nobody, to tell you the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
When I wake up in the morning
I don't really want too much
See the sunlight as a warning
'Cause you're too far away to touch

[Chorus]
Eyes on the hourglass
As we sink into the sand
Hands up, there's nothing we can do about it
It's fine, love, 'cause I don't wanna live without it
Eyes on the hourglass
As we sink into the sand
Hands up, there's nothing we can do about it
It's fine, love, 'cause I don't wanna live without it

[Verse 2]
So come on, surprise me, I don't care who
You're still missin', time's tickin', ain't got a clue
Something I said, the way that I move
Strong passion, high fashion, too much for you
Don't complicate this, simple to me
I've got it, you want it, but it might not be free
The sun falls slowly, shadows of love
Get together, now or never, can't wait till dawn

[Pre-Chorus]
When I wake up in the morning
I don't really want too much
See the sunlight as a warning
'Cause you're too far away to touch

[Chorus]
Eyes on the hourglass
As we sink into the sand
Hands up, there's nothing we can do about it
It's fine, love, 'cause I don't wanna live without it
Eyes on the hourglass
As we sink into the sand
Hands up, there's nothing we can do about it
It's fine, love, 'cause I don't wanna live without it

[Intro: Skooly]
We got London on the track

[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug]
Peanut butter jelly, peanut butter jelly
Peanut butter jelly, peanut butter jelly
Peanut butter jelly, no deli
I got money, check the store credit
No new names unless you know they did it
Sleep in palace, watch it happen

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I don't have a break, I'm keepin' bread
I'm gettin' fast like a track, mil I want that
Baby that cap's for the feds
That ain't your ho, don't tell all the secrets
I don't give no damn bout no nigga
I don't give no fuck bout no nigga, I promise, I promise
I throw me some ones on these bitches
I stack them hundreds to the ceiling, they over there runnin'
I look like I came from nothin'
And I look like I came for somethin' and I'm comin', I want it
Yeah, I drink on that lean
And I smoke on that dope til I motherfuckin' vomit

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Run up that check, give a fuck bout that shit
I guess I go to jail if I want that lil bitch
They kept me with my strap on my own, that lil bitch
I don't answer no questions, want speak with my lawyer
Tell your boss I said where my phone call, that's it
A lot of nigga shit, talkin' you don't ever get paid
Remember me, I've been bout it, dealin' out the 10th grade
Ridin' round in my homeboy Buick
With a tool in the unit
We'd go to school, eat lunch
Cut school, get back to it, nigga
Listen nigga, this the Bankroll Mob
If you can't go hard then you can't come here
Let me make somethin' clear
If you lookin' for a sucker well it ain't none here
Look we got artillery for days, we can spray from here
Hit your ass on the side of the face somewhere
On the side of the road, let you lay somewhere

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I don't have a break, I'm keepin' bread
I'm gettin' fast like a track, mil I want that
Baby that cap's for the feds
That ain't your ho, don't tell all the secrets
I don't give no damn bout no nigga
I don't give no fuck bout no nigga, I promise, I promise
I throw me some ones on these bitches
I stack them hundreds to the ceiling, they over there runnin'
I look like I came from nothin'
And I look like I came for somethin' and I'm comin', I want it
Yeah, I drink on that lean
And I smoke on that dope til I motherfuckin' vomit

[Verse 2: Young Dro]
Okay, big paper
If I'm hungry, I eat 100 dollars then shit paper
Sick flavor, got the white double mint twin
With me on Simpson, mint Wraither
Swag impeccable, peckin' a heck of them, cases federal
I'm a felon, don't throw it off, I need medical
Oh you regular, terrible, soft, and lame, etcetera
And I don't want one ho nigga, I wanna a plethora
Twenty bricks in the regal
Pullin' up, Ethel Ridge, extended heater
Death threat, I got this shit on
I'm untouchable man I got this shit on
Nigga you die soon as I say okay
My whip? That's strawberry Yoplait
I got a chopper on the charger
You put a little gas in it, that motherfucker blow about 4 days
Niggas broke
And I've been leanin' on Ac' all in this bitch
And I've been smokin' on gas all in this bitch
Pullin' up at the light no tag on my shit
AK hit everybody in the stomach, pussy nigga shit
Bag all day

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I don't have a break, I'm keepin' bread
I'm gettin' fast like a track, mil I want that
Baby that cap's for the feds
That ain't your ho, don't tell all the secrets
I don't give no damn bout no nigga
I don't give no fuck bout no nigga, I promise, I promise
I throw me some ones on these bitches
I stack them hundreds to the ceiling, they over there runnin'
I look like I came from nothin'
And I look like I came for somethin' and I'm comin', I want it
Yeah, I drink on that lean
And I smoke on that dope til I motherfuckin' vomit

[Verse 3: Lil Duke]
I got the bread
Ya'll bitch'll give me the head
Fuck her on the sofa, not the bed
Hit that lil bitch from the back
And I take out with your pack
And I'm not givin' it back
I done lost all my respect
Don't drink no red, we pour Act
Sippin' on lean, it's so crazy
I ride out that second, I swear I don't know how to act, no

[Verse 4: Young Thug]
Keep it goin' Energizer bunny, I'm so-so with these carrots
My bitch the baddest, but she not your average
She so, so arrogant, woah
Her titties calcium, me booty calories
And both of 'em squish me, God damn we sandwiches
I do this shit for my momma
Take off with your pack and keep runnin'
I'm not the Birdman but I'm stunnin'
I flip that bitch like a omelet
I've been with ya from the start
I did that shit from my heart
I'm so so so sorry I hurt you
And I see the scar but you know I'm retarded

[Pre-Chorus: Young Thug]
Peanut butter jelly, peanut butter jelly
Peanut butter jelly, peanut butter jelly
Peanut butter jelly, no deli
I got money, check the store credit
No new names unless you know they did it
Sleep in palace, watch it happen

[Chorus: Young Thug]
I don't have a break, I'm keepin' bread
I'm gettin' fast like a track, mil I want that
Baby that cap's for the feds
That ain't your ho, don't tell all the secrets
I don't give no damn bout no nigga
I don't give no fuck bout no nigga, I promise, I promise
I throw me some ones on these bitches
I stack them hundreds to the ceiling, they over there runnin'
I look like I came from nothin'
And I look like I came for somethin' and I'm comin', I want it
Yeah, I drink on that lean
And I smoke on that dope til I motherfuckin' vomit

[Outro: Skooly]
We got London on the track, on the track, on the track, on the track...

[Verse 1]
From a hellhole
You sell blow, better get enough to get an elbow
Or you ain't shit
You be the man when you seen bricks
And not before that
It ain't gon be no sucker shit, you better know that
Prepare for the gunplay, you'll encounter it one day
Happen that kept me with it and I'm back on the frontpage
Just play this shit how it go, I follow the g-code
They so far up on niggas they think u got a cheatcode
All I ever wanted was a widebody Benz
And a bad bitch, you ain't got no widebody friends
Ain't never got to live hand to mouth
Long as I can keep the cheater up off me at the gambling house

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
From the gutter, nigga get high with they mother
To take they mind off they father go do some time for they brother
Boy you get caught with that bundle better not point at another
'Fore you get hit with a title from which you never recover
My uncle mad tell me boy you better be the man
You better fight, they whoop your ass then you fight again (damn)
Coming live from the trap spot
Get everything from a slab to a laptop (cocaine)
Divide the have from the have-nots
Should twelve get on your ass, give them nothing but gas
Expecting nothing but the money, spend it fast as it coming
In God We Trust, for everyone else, it’s cash only

[Hook]
OK we broadcast live from the west side

[Verse 3]
Nigga we live and direct from the project
Where niggas ain't got shit to lose, they ain't got shit
So when they get a little cheque, think they hot shit
A pyrex and nine out of ten apartment
And hot shit half price, nigga hard shit
And thot shit'll turn around every week, but it did so you keep
If the neck game ain't good if a lame nigga peep
Ayy we'll turn up through the week but on the weekend!

[Verse]
Hey, jumped off the porch, with one thing on my mind
Find a way to make a fortune, and keep from doing time
I accomplished one of those, but the other nevermind
And stay away from scary niggas, they'll kill you every time
Think I'm Triple 6, 8 Ball, MJ, Lil Jon
Crunk off in that pussy leanin' in it  tryin' kill some
She workin' on the pipe like this is what she pay her bill from
Cuz them other cats she fuck just fill it up a lil some
2 things I don't like: A bitch who can't shut up and one who wanna stay the night
Whatchu say you playin' right?
You better hit the blunt and tell Uber to meet you at the light, hoe
Back to where you came from, that's just how the dice roll
Uncle Quentin, Man, they raised me don't take shit from anyone
So extortion is off the list, TIP you won't get a penny from
Bet 10 to 1, that you won't reach my level of success 'fore my kids are grown
I'm gettin' topped off in a Thunderbird
I guess you can call that some ThunderDome
Huh, yeah
And I'm already off of whatever you on, bitch
Aye I'm king of whatever better let it be known
I don't give a damn bout you making no song
You better watch what you say in your song
'Fore you see what happen when faking go wrong
Say you gon' overthrow me, what's taking so long?
I been kicking back patiently waiting for someone to rattle my cage
No I'm not that old nigga think that he run it, and talkin' bout what he did back in the day
Oh no
I'm just a viscious as ever, more brilliant and clever and still 'bout that action today
Oh no
You can't compete in the league that I play in, learn from Jimmy Henchmen and rapping like Jay
And how can I say it, I lead the generation who lasted the one with bandanas and running in the traphouse, police we sell crack in their face
My presence suggest, i have tats in my face
And my reputation ain't nothing to play with, you owe me some money, suggest that you pay it, or that double dbarrel I'mma put on your head
I'm thinking you might tell someone what I did, but you gon' be dead
How you gon' say it, dead man don't talk thought you knew it
You can scream from the grave but we don't wanna hear it
All i hear what the Bankroll said, I stay booted up so I can't go dead
Nigga fuck that caseif it can't go fed, what the fuck your mind on if it ain't on bread
And i stay poured up, Ac' on deck i don't drink no red
In my suite bad bitches link up, got 'em in the bedroom can't go to bed
Ain't no games shawty know how i play it
I know I'm the shit shawty you ain't got to say it
If you can't see now, how the king get down
May as well turn around, bitch, you ain’t gon see it

[Verse 1]
Never really felt bad about it
As we drank deep from the lie
'Cause I felt melting magnets, babe
The second I saw you through half-shut eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Smoke and sunset, off Mulholland
He was talking, I was wonderin' 'bout
You and that girl, she your girlfriend?
Face from heaven, bet the world she don't know
Pretty girls don't know the things that I know
Walk my way, I'll share the things that she won't

[Chorus]
Uh-oh, dancing past the point of no return
Let go, we can free ourselves of all we've learned
I love this secret language that we're speakin'
Say it to me, let's embrace the point of no return
Let's embrace the point of no return
Let's embrace the point of no return

[Verse 2]
Never really thought we would make it
We be thinking about what could have been
But we've had a record summer, can't turn it down, oh
Now I don't wanna see the end begin

[Pre-Chorus]
Smoke and sunset, off Mulholland
He was talking, I was wonderin' 'bout
You and that girl, she your girlfriend?
Face from heaven, bet the world she don't know
Pretty girls don't know the things that I know
Walk my way, I'll share the things that she won't

[Chorus]
Uh-oh, dancing past the point of no return
Let go, we can free ourselves of all we've learned
I love this secret language that we're speakin'
Say it to me, let's embrace the point of no return
Let's embrace the point of no return
Let's embrace the point of no return
Let's embrace the point of no return
Let's embrace the point of no return
(Let's embrace the point of no return)
(Let's embrace the point of no return)

Now what if Michael Jordan decided to stick to baseball and Jay-Z decided to stick to crack
Just Blaze decided to stick to engineering and Kanye never decided to rap?
What if a nigga from the Chi that was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talking about coke and birds, it was more like spoken word
'Cept the nigga's really putting it down
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
But kept in mind as long as 

[?] folks and niggas is dead broke
Some things they gone never change
But it ain't them 

[?] folks, it's the white folks that brought us over here with boats and tight ropes
But don't forget it was 

[?] niggas cause
The kings got rid of us, they selling a crackhead soap
Now follow me, sometimes I feel like dream is subtitles
Say things that mean things but hide them in club titles
So you'll hear something real but think that it's meaningless
Like, "Damn, I know I feel but I don't know what the meaning is!"
See that there's what make it so ingenious
And that's why Kweli never was lenient
Cause he know what I got, know I was making it hot
'Fore I was making a lot, 'fore I made it to the Roc

[Outro]
Yah, yeah
Yah, yeah
There once was a hopeless romantic
Who’d give his heart away on a whim
I am no longer him
I’d rather not relive all her reasons
All untimely, yet I understood
My heart is broken for good

Chorus:
Cause you lie
Tell me what happened to forever
Instead of crying, I talk to the chair
You told the world we’d always be together
Now I’m the only one standing here
I’m ashamed and angry at you all because
I believed every word that you told me
But you promised me love
Promised me love, love, love
Promised me love, love, love
Promised me love, love, love

I wanna compromise and be optimistic
This is all of a sudden absurd
But you gave me your word
Love is a battle field, who won?
Look at the casualty we’ve become
How could you promise something that can’t be done?
Chorus:
Cause you lie
Tell me what happened to forever
Instead of crying, I talk to the chair
You told the world we’d always be together
Now I’m the only one standing here
I’m ashamed and angry at you all because
I believed every word that you told me
But you promised me love, love, love
Promised me love, love, love
Promised me love, love, love
Promised me love, love, love

You promised me love, love, love
Promised me love, love, love, love

Babe you can believe me when I say I tried my best
But there's no other way
You deserve the world, I couldn't give you less

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm not perfect, the way you're perfect
And though it hurts, yeah, it hurts to say goodbye

[Chorus]
I know I let you down
It wasn't that your love wasn't good enough
Couldn't stick around
It's only in myself that I didn't trust
I had good intentions
I had good intentions

[Verse 2]
And it's a shame
Oh, all the heartache that I went and put you through
I take the blame
Cause the truth, there's really nothing you could do

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm not perfect, the way you're perfect
And though it hurts, yeah, it hurts to say goodbye

[Chorus]
I know I let you down
It wasn't that your love wasn't good enough
Couldn't stick around
It's only in myself that I didn't trust
I had good intentions
I had good intentions
I had good intentions
I  had good intentions

[Outro]
But I'm not perfect the way you're perfect
And though it hurts, yeah, it hurts to say goodbye

[Verse 1]
I met this girl at a party cause she said she was down
I really didn't know her but I'd seen her around
The kind of girl that only likes to hang with the guys
Can tell that she is trouble, see it all in her eyes
But I pursued it the best that I can
Had me a couple shots, I'm feeling like a man
How was I supposed to know that I was part of a plan?
But it's too late now

[Chorus]
Now you're the reason that I can't sleep at night and I can't go home
I know it ain't right, gotta leave you alone
But I can't, whoa no
But I can't, whoa no
Now you're the reason that I can't sleep at night and I can't go home
I know it ain't right, gotta leave you alone
But I can't, whoa no
But I can't, whoa no

[Verse 2]
Well, back to the party where it's going down
The smoke is in the air, smell it all around
Some girls are on the floor, looking good getting down
Some hating motherfucker steady staring me down
But I ain't worried about that for the time
My girl's across the way giving me the eye
She's got her back turned to some other guy
But it's too late now

[Chorus]
Now you're the reason that I can't sleep at night and I can't go home
I know it ain't right, gotta leave you alone
But I can't, whoa no
But I can't, whoa no
Now you're the reason that I can't sleep at night and I can't go home
I know it ain't right, gotta leave you alone
But I can't, whoa no
But I can't, whoa no

[Chorus]
Now you're the reason that I can't sleep at night and I can't go home
I know it ain't right, gotta leave you alone
But I can't, whoa no
But I can't, whoa no
I gotta leave you alone, it ain't right
I gotta leave you alone, it ain't right
I gotta leave you alone, it ain't right
I gotta leave you alone, it ain't right
Now you're the reason that I can't sleep at night and I can't go home
I know it ain't right, gotta leave you alone
But I can't, whoa no
But I can't, whoa no

[Verse 1]
When the white flag sails, covered in streaks of blood
There'll be an endless sea, of hands rising up
And the preacher man, and the preacher's son
Will stand arm in arm, just like everyone

[Pre-Chorus]
We longing to be free, I won't let you fade away
We shared so many dreams, I won't let them fade away

[Chorus]
In the hands of love, we carry on
Stronger than we started
The ash and dust that trail behind us
Wicked is the blinded
Who we are comes to life, yeah
Who we are comes to life

[Verse 2]
When the water spills, the glass will break
It drips like tears, running up your face
And the hounds will cry, for the dogs of war
But the sounds of joy, that victory will soar

[Pre-Chorus]
We longing to be free, I won't let you fade away
We shared so many dreams, I won't let them fade away

[Chorus]
In the hands of love, we carry on
Stronger than we started
The ash and dust that trail behind us
Wicked is the blinded
Who we are comes to life, yeah
Who we are comes to life

[Bridge]
We longing to be free, I won't let you fade away

[Chorus]
In the hands of love, we carry on
Stronger than we started
The ash and dust that trail behind us
Wicked is the blinded
Who we are comes to life, yeah
Who we are comes to life

[Outro]
We come alive
We come alive
We come alive
We come alive
We come to life

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, uh, (Uh, uh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yo, now

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I got a little bit of money fillin' my pockets, roll around like I run this shit
I got a system filled up with toxins, I've been broken-hearted, now it's fuck that bitch
Getting high to deal with my problems, fucking bitches, getting drunk as shit
But these bitches getting obnoxious, they nuttin' to me though, I love this shit
Go long days, longer nights, talk too much, the wrong advice, all the lights
And call my life, doctor, doctor, will you help me? Get me healthy, keep it low, this where hell be
Ain't shit you can tell me now, fuck this rap shit, bitch, I'm sellin' out
Ooh shit, with my new bitch, you jealous now, smokin' weed at the crib watching Belly now (Alright)
All the pain that they causin' like, fuck it, we ballin', now everythin' straight
You feeling the feeling, I'm chilling, just living, I'm burning away
Conversations we having, I'm getting too static, too much on my plate
Lord, I need me a break

[Chorus: Miguel & Mac Miller]
But I'll be good by the weekend (Alright) (Yeah)
I'll be good by the weekend (Yeah)
Everything good by the weekend (Alright) (Yeah)
Everything will be good by the weekend (By the weekend)

[Post-Chorus: Mac Miller]
We going out tonight, yeah, we going out tonight, like fuck it
We going out tonight, yeah, we going out tonight, fuck it
We going out tonight, yeah, we going out tonight (It's a weekend)
We going out tonight, yeah, we going out tonight (It's a weekend)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I been having trouble sleeping, battling these demons
Wondering what's the thing that keeps me breathing: is it money, fame or neither?
I been thinking about the places that I frequent, all the people that I see
I’m just out here livin' decent, what do it mean to be a G? Yeah (Alright)
And all the time we fall behind, bitches in the concubine, I call her mine, crazy
She ain't God as I, I make water wine, pausin' time, it's common, they often hate me
Never will I walk in line, I cross the T's and dot the I's, wondering, well
Wonderin' how I got this high, fell asleep and forgot to die, Goddamn
I'm poppin' them downers and drinkin' them powders, faded
Get it over the counter, I'm stuck on the browser, like, how did I make it?
These bitches don't know me, this shit is so lonely until she get naked
Don't even know what the day is

[Chorus: Miguel & Mac Miller]
But I'll be good by the weekend (Alright) (Yeah)
I'll be good by the weekend (Yeah)
Everything good by the weekend (Alright) (Yeah)
Everything will be good by the weekend (By the weekend)

[Outro: Miguel]
Mondays I think of you, but I ain’t tripping on it
Tuesdays I’m hittin', gotta get my hands up on ya
Wednesdays I'm lit wit'chu, you know you're staying over
Thursdays I’m sick of you, I got to get rid of you
'Cause Fridays are always the start of the time of
My life, alright
When I get faded you hate it, but, baby
It’s gon' be alright
Haha, alright

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Yeah

[Verse: Mac Miller]
I know it's been a minute since I've been away
Didn't mean to cause you pain, I just needed to escape
Ain't sayin' that I'm sober, I'm just in a better place
I'm on my way over, I'm just runnin' kinda late
And you know I've been through all the highs
I've seen all the lows, lost track of time
I'm coming home, you know my mind
Places it goes, and it goes, and it goes

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
It's only a game
Don't be afraid
These doors will close
And people change
One day you'll go
Right now you're here
Don't leave just yet
Don't disappear

[Outro: Elle Varner]
Good morning, baby

[Intro: Lil B & Mac Miller]
Time flies, time flies
As we keep livin' and as we keep bein' positive
All we can do is hold onto these memories (Yeah)
Mac Miller, I love you

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
All of my homies used to get on my case like, "When you 'bout to kill 'em?"
Soon as I'm out of millions and my girl sprout some children
But I've been murderin' the game, I'm almost out of victims
This food for thought usually enough to feed a thousand pigeons
I'm out here livin' if you wonder where I been though
Shit bro, would you give it all up for these nymphos?
I been broke then got rich, what's inside your wallet?
Half-man and half-amazin', but that's just me bein' modest
I'm an honest man
My mama told me never put it on the lotto and
I work for everything I get, that is my motto, fam
So when I die, these bitches still can fuck my hologram, goddamn

[Pre-Chorus: Mac Miller]
And all that drama that you comin' with, you blowin' my high
On my way up to the function, gettin' dome in my ride
I got 'em worried that my mind fried
I'm goin' up before I skydive
You can see the way that...

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Lil B]
(Time flies)
Watch as time go
(Time flies)
Time moves, time flows
(Try to catch it, time flies)
How do we handle these things?
(Time flies, try to catch it)
I am time, we are time and we have control
One thing we need to remember
Is that we are all in this together

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Yeah
You can't expect the unexpected, these dreams I manifested
From my head into reality, they seem a bit excessive, but
I don't stress it, two hands to count my blessings
All the times that I've been reckless with a ego big as Texas
Thinkin', "I'm the man"
I never let these hoes inside the plan
My room for bullshit in the crib small as a child's hands
I fill the shoes and walk the path where only giants stand
I am the fire man, shit, I'm way too fly to land, yeah
I'm smokin' weed all alone
On the road, even though I know they need me at home
Keep my control
From a city where it's freezin' and cold
Each to their own
Punches like this prolly beat up Stallone

[Pre-Chorus: Mac Miller]
And all that drama that you comin' with, you blowin' my high
On my way up to the function, gettin' dome in my ride (Yeah)
I got 'em worried that my mind fried
I'm goin' up before I skydive
You can see the way that...

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Lil B]
(Time flies)
One day, we will
(Time flies)
We will find
(Try to catch it, time flies)
We will conquer, conquer with love
(Time flies, try to catch it)
While time is on our side
Continue to hold to those beautiful memories
They won't be here forever, but our spirit lives on
Lil B

[Pre-Chorus: Mac Miller]
When I was just a kid
Dreamt that one day we'd all get rich
No more problems and no more tricks
I set my sights high 'cause in my lifetime
Man, I've seen some shit
Yeah, I swear to God
I've seen some muthafuckin' shit
Whatcha doin' if you ain't on your job? (Bullshittin')

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Ab-Soul, Mac Miller, Ab-Soul]
Hey, blow out your candles, make a wish
What's a life if you never take a risk?
Ain't a place too far, ain't a dream too big
Nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun (Let's have some fun)
There ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul & Mac Miller]
In my lifetime, my whole M.O. was to get this M-O-N-E-Y
Sabotage the wealthy and enrichen the poor (Soul)
Long story short, that's one of my long-term goals
My anatomy is platinum, gold is old
Lettin' my hair swang like Pootie Tang (Uh)
I done seen some spooky things through these Gucci shades
Acute to cute bitches, niggas with drums
Niggas with bands like the Martin Luther King parade (I have a dream)
But can't we all just get along? (One day)
Like Martin Lawrence would say and get along with our day
She say, "Soulo, you so crazy and deranged", I say, "I know"
Roll that weed, nigga! (Shake that ass, ho!)
Most Dope, Top Dawg off the leash
Sounwave on the beat (Wizzo!) and our key is anarchy
Your confidence is caca to a kamikaze
Still wishin' peace to all y'all, pardon my nostalgia

[Pre-Chorus: Mac Miller]
When I was just a kid (Okay)
Dreamt (Soul,) that one day we'd all get rich (Okay)
No more problems and no more tricks (Okay)
I set my sights high 'cause in my lifetime
Man, I've seen some shit (Woo)
Yeah, I swear to God
I've seen some muthafuckin' shit
Whatcha doin' if you ain't on your job? (Bullshittin')

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Ab-Soul, Mac Miller, Ab-Soul]
Hey, blow out your candles, make a wish
What's a life if you never take a risk?
Ain't a place too far, ain't a dream too big
Nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun (Let's have some fun)
There ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun

[Post-Chorus: Mac Miller]
Yeah, I've seen some shit (I've seen it all)
How'd I end up in a place like this? (In this)
Swear to God, seen some shit (I've seen it all)
Light a match, keep it lit, yeah, it is what it is

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
In this lifetime, be the time of your life
It's been a while but it'll come back to you just like ridin' a bike (Alright, alright)
And as a child, I was curious, my mind was the dirtiest (Uh-huh)
Curse words was probably my first words (Affirmative) (God damn)
My home run derby shit (Derby shit), was makin' profit out the park
Even the brightest minds will hang around at dark sometimes
I had to fight for mine, Tyson in his prime, used to idolize
Had to right my wrongs, the days short, the nights is long
I'm makin' corpses when it's on and eatin' swordfish
From gigantic portions, Lord is important, but I am stronger
I'm a monster with the heart of a lion, divide and conquer
Walk on water, won't be long 'til I'm flyin', that's my departure (Jesus)
I'm a goner
Shoot you down from the sky with eyes of a archer (Ah, yeah)
Better find that thing you die for (Ah, yeah)
(I don't know what I get so high for) (Ah, yeah)
I'm a problem and as hard as I try, no hidin' from karma
You'd be traumatized seein' what came across these eyes
There was a time...

[Pre-Chorus: Mac Miller]
When I was just a kid
Dreamt that one day we'd all get rich
No more problems and no more tricks
I set my sights high 'cause In my lifetime
Man, I've seen some shit
Yeah, I swear to God
I've seen some muthafuckin' shit
Whatcha doin' if you ain't on your job?

[Bridge: Mac Miler]
Take your time
Don't close your eyes
Life happens in a flash
And you don't wanna miss that

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Ab-Soul, Mac Miller, Ab-Soul]
Blow out your candles, make a wish
What's a life if you never take a risk?
Ain't a place too far, ain't a dream too big
Nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun (Let's have some fun)
There ain't nothin' wrong with a little bit of fun (Go have some)

[Post-Chorus: Mac Miller]
Yeah, I've seen some shit (I've seen it all)
How'd I end up in a place like this? (In this)
Swear to God, seen some shit (I've seen it all)
Light a match, keep it lit, yeah, it is what it is

[Outro: Mac Miller & Ab-Soul]
We all grow up to be gangstas (Gangstas), playas (Playas), snitches
Freaks and strangers, politicians (Strangers, politicians)
Good and evil people (Good and evil)
Sinners, saints and everything in between
Wicked as Aleister Crowley, know﻿ me
Lately I've been thinkin' (Lately)
I've, I've been thinkin'
What's the difference? What's the difference?
Nothing at all! (Never mind us)
Ayy, let me just add one more thing, Josh
*Match being lit*
Ayy, ayy, watch that shit, man, you almost burnt me, nigga!

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Woo!
Okay, woo!
Yeah (Okay)
Yeah

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I give a fuck less and less every day (Okay)
The more you give a fuck, I guess the less you make (Money)
Homie we just out here tryna elevate (Skrrrrt)
Heaven is a crime scene, stay behind the yellow tape (Whoop whoop)
I started makin' money in eleventh grade
Soon as I learned that the more you do, the less you wait (Uh-huh)
Got a bigger crib, always use the extra space
Shit was so different in 2008 (Woo)
Growin' pains, fill the open veins with Novocain
Relapse, I eat that, I don't complain
I'm just ramblin'
You want war? It’s N64, Blitz Champion (Sucker!)
Out of space channelin', brain-damagin'
Heavy rain, game cancelin', proud to be American, yeah

[Refrain: Mac Miller]
They tell me, "Get yourself straight (Woo)
How much more money can you make?" (Okay, okay, okay)

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I'm just tryna grow up old and rich (Old and rich)
Maybe get married to a local bitch (Local bitch)
I be, I be, I be, I be over shit (Over shit)
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness (No way)
I'm just tryna grow up old and rich (Old and rich)
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness (Okay)
I be, I be, I be, I be over shit (Over shit)
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness (Okay)

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I'm a deranged motherfucker (Woo), took too many uppers (Woo)
Now it's rush hour, Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker, yeah (50 million dollars!)
I stuck around the past six summers (Woo)
Karma is a bitch and that bitch don't love ya, yeah
We was in the attic, you could smell the weed
Bitches gettin' naked, we was selling E
Bitches kissin' bitches just like Ellen D (Ellen D)
In the kitchen whippin' biscuits, givin' generously (Thank you)
I thank the Lord I made it out, no STD (Word)
Lost a few too many brain cells, I'm special needs, yeah

[Refrain: Mac Miller]
They tell me, "Get yourself straight (Straight)
How much more money can you make?"

[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I'm just tryna grow up old and rich (Old and rich)
Maybe get married to a local bitch (A local bitch)
I be, I be, I be, I be over shit (Over shit)
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness (No way, no way, no way, no way, no way)
I'm just tryna grow up old and rich (Old and rich)
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness
I be, I be, I be, I be over shit (Over shit)
The world don't give a fuck about your loneliness (Okay)

[Outro: Vinny Radio]
Ladies and gentlemen in attendance, good morning
It's the BabyFace Don Dada checking in
And I want you to know
It ain't about complaining, it's about maintaining
Y'know I'm talking about?
Don't ever become content because you will repent
Ya feel that? Go get it
That's your life, go live it
Pass me my Hennessy and my Grand Marnier
If you will

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Who's that on the other end of the phone?
Didn't hear nothin' when I said my hello
Oh well, to hell then we go
So high, lookin' at heaven below
You know me though from coast to coast for smokin' dope
Overdose with the holy ghost, but hold the phones
I hold my own, was local grown
Been killin' that shit since row the boat
Know I'm supposed to hold the throne, be honest
One more drink, I'ma be an alcoholic
I don't wanna think like better unconscious
Need fresh air, everything so toxic
I open coffin doors with a .38 when it's time for war
Told my mama, "You ain't need no drama
And you ain't gotta cry no more now" (Now)

[Bridge 1]
It'll be alright
My mind on the run, I won't sleep tonight, it's like
When it all goes up in flames, who gon' hold me down? (Down)
And I'm the chosen one
Lookin' all around, what has the world become? Um
The only way to change it is to burn it to the ground (Ground)
I've been gettin' paid
About four or five bitches in the Escalade, bet it rain
This money feel the same, I'm afraid that I'ma drown (Drown) (Yeah)

[Chorus]
You've never been better than me
From this prison, I'm settin' 'em free
Open eyes, I'ma let you see
This world just like our dreams
I'll throw it all away to celebrate one more holiday
I'm runnin' to the edge
And when I get there, best believe that I'ma jump, jump
To see if I can fly, fly
I wonder if I jump, jump
Do you think that I can fly, fly?

[Verse 2]
Yeah
It's the life of a entertainer
I need that check, go and get the waiter
Fuck a troll, this destruction mode
And these explosions don't need detonators
I met my maker in a elevator, he was headed to the top floor
We're quite similar
We just did our work, but we were in it for a lot more
We would try to change the world, but we got bored
When I rip this show, got a encore
Back when we were still in school
We didn't listen to the list of rules
Wrote a million words on the chalkboard
I don't need answers to the questions of intangibles
I told my homies, "The top so lonely
But we ain't gonna die, not now" (Now)

[Bridge 2]
You gon' make it here, live free tonight 'til the day appear
Let's sit back right where we at and let this money pile (Pile)
How do we get rich? If she actin' crazy, you don't need that bitch
Wish I knew back then all the things that I know now (Now)
Go on and on, knew I had this shit all along
Take a breath, feel this moment, hold it just so you can (Can)
Look where we at and look where we came from
When will we wake up? Lost in translation

[Chorus]
You've never been better than me
From this prison, I'm settin' 'em free
Open eyes, I'ma let you see
This world just like our dreams
I'll throw it all away to celebrate one more holiday
I'm runnin' to the edge
And when I get there, best believe that I'ma jump, jump
To see if I can fly, fly
I wonder if I jump, jump
Do you think that I can fly, fly?

[Intro]
*Alarm clock sounds*
Um, uh
Woo, yeah
Woo, yeah
Okay, okay, yeah, um

[Verse 1]
We in-between heaven and hell (Hell)
Fuck a nine-to-five, I'd rather end up dead or in jail (Jail)
American Ninja to these obstacles, no stoppin' me, we on the move
Your mouth runnin' like a prostitute's, keep your head to yourself
I work harder than anybody you know (Know)
I'm done with tricks, don't need no money to blow
Deadly aim, self-contained, superstar, they yell the name
Blood diamonds, finna go to hell for my chain
The P fitted on my head though
I'm too high, you can't reach me with the cell phone
No goodbyes, no hellos
You don't want this life I live, you'd rather had a wife and kid
Shootin' dice with Jesus Christ, put twenty on the midnight
To everyone who sell me drugs:
Don't mix it with that bullshit, I'm hopin' not to join the 27 Club
Just want the coke-dealer house with the velvet rug
Fuck the world, there's no one else but us (Whoa)

[Chorus]
Everything we think we love
It ain't nothin' but a brand name
To everyone but us (Every motherfucker but us)
It ain't nothin' but a brand name, nothin' but a brand name
Yeah
Ask her what she wearin', say it's nothin' but a brand name
Baby, this right here is handmade

[Verse 2]
Yeah
I got brothers, I don't need no friends (Friends)
My shoes off, I'm comfortable, I'm chillin', smokin' weed again (Again)
I'm from the 'Burgh, not the burbs
Investigatin' my nation, homie, we ain't concerned
Went from the 412 out to the 310
Went from the pavement in my basement to them yellow brick roads
See, I was on my P's and Q's like L-M-N-O
But kickin' bitches out my crib, somebody tell 'em go home, oh, no
I was in the crib with my different shit
Simple livin', I'm a hypocrite 'cause I'm filthy rich and got businesses
Been had wifey, had mistresses
Been tryna tell you what my vision is, but y'all still ain't listenin'
The war ain't winnin', it's just beginnin'
And I've been 'bout Sparta like Michigan, I got stats
They got opinions, I got facts
LeBron left home, but he came back
This what raised me, made me rap
PA's baby, I ain't been to PA lately
See, I left and they call me shady
I'm a white rapper, they always call me Shady
Got no idea what I'm contemplatin', I guess (Woo)

[Chorus]
Everything we think we love
It ain't nothin' but a brand name
To everyone but us (Every motherfucker but us)
It ain't nothin' but a brand name, nothin' but a brand name
Yeah
Ask her what she wearin', say it's nothin' but a brand name
Baby, this right here is handmade
Woo

[Outro]
La, la, la, la (La, la, la, la)
Yeah (La, la, la, la)
Everything we love, love
Good mornin' (La, la, la, la)
Good mornin'
And everyone but us (Every motherfucker but us)
Good mornin' (La, la, la, la)
Good mornin'
Yeah

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Yeah, yeah
Let me get a little bit more beat
Yeah

[Verse: Mac Miller]
Ask God if she believe in me and will she accept me as a deity
And tell me the secrecy won't keep you free
I'm sleeping, won't dream until the demons leave
I took a nap, beneath a tree in the shade
Feel the sharpness of the swords and blades of grass
Picturin' the images that make you laugh
I left you out to die, but will you take me back? (Back)
Somewhere in between the crazy and the conscious (Conscious)
She's naked underneath them shadows
Let the sunlight undress her slow
I don't know who I am, I'm so good at doin' impressions though (Uh-huh)
I'm goin' to the festival, (The festival) need to let me go
I wake up, pop a couple Benadryls, go back to sleep
It's all made up, everything they said was real, it has to be
'Cause actually the master fast asleep
And the castles back-back in his private quarters (Private quarters)
That's a master for you, this a revolution, we don't have no order (No, no, no)
All this torture, thought I had to warn ya (Had to warn ya)
Leave it all behind and go to California (California) (Go, go)
I'm past the signs, it's the real thing, try analyzin' this feelin'
Ya can't fathom (Can't fathom) (Can't, can't, can't)

[Bridge: Yukimi Nagano of Little Dragon]
(Festival, festival, festival, festival)
My hands are above the clouds
From the clap-clap thunder lookin' down
While you're runnin' around
I lift you up when you drown
Unlock the mission, the planet in rotation
Full speed chasin' and you're always runnin' ahead
You're always runnin' ahead
You got second chances, happy birthday, sweet romances
And you battle like a champion, why
Do you wanna go, do you wanna go
Do you wanna go to the festival?
You got angels weepin', see them drippin' from the sky
You watch 'em with your third eye (So, so, so)
Do you wanna go, do you wanna go
Do you wanna go to the festival? (To the festival)
To the festival (To the festival)
To the festival (To the festival)
Festival (Festival)
Festival (Festival)

[Instrumental]

[Outro: Ab-Soul]

In the helicopter, fuck it, we gon' land here (Land here)

They keep you on the shelf where the racks at (Goddamn)

Came up from the gravel to the motherfuckin' castle (Woo)

Got a whole bunch of trophies and medallions (And medallions)
Been the motherfuckin' man before the motherfuckin' money
Got another hundred grand, but who's countin'? Whoa

But me and you? We are not one and the same

Where I live, stir a little kid
Goddamn, my life changed

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I made a couple million off rap like it's nothin'
Keep that shit quiet, I don't stunt too much
She gon' fuck me, she don't give it up too much
Drink liquor like water, gettin' drunk too much, I
I was off them drugs too much
In the crib fuckin' all these little sluts too much
How it is when you young, blowin' up too much
Talkin' shit, but I know that you ain't up to much
Man, I been workin', said I'm the greatest
Now that I'm certain, Benzo the latest
Drunk and I'm swervin', I'm goin' ape-shit on all of my verses
Fuck bein' famous, I'm here to fuck up your favorite
Lately I'm hearin' too much of the same shit
Young and I'm faded, killin' shit, bury it under my basement

[Outro]
Shut your motherfuckin' mouth, bitch (Silence)
Fuck your motherfuckin' couch, bitch (Violent)

Bitches in love with my face, yeah, I'm collectin'

[Part I]

[Intro]
Ahem, ahem
Good evening everybody
How's everybody doing?
Just wanna ask you a question, um, have you, have you
Have you been in love, before?

[Verse]
You like your vodka with a little touch of lime
You should pro'bly take your heels off, 'cause you been runnin' through my mind
Oh baby, they say we're no good for each other
And I can't really tell, what is this spell you put me under?
Your love's not too kind to me
I hate the pain, these days of rain
You playin' games of hide and seek, my love
And I'm still tryna find you, I'm lookin' for you, babe
And I'm still tryna find you, through sunshine or rain

[Part II]

[Intro: 

[?]]
I love you

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah
You got your stained glass iris, diamond behind your eyelids
Autopilot fly, my heart skip a beat like a scratched CD
Your skin smell like butterscotch and your lips taste like kiwi
Let's take a plane to Fiji, make a date, let's take it easy
Love is power, swear there's somethin' 'bout her that make me nervous
Mother Earth done gave us all a gift, she made you perfect
Let's eat some mushrooms and go to the circus
Girl, you know I'm lovin' you just like you deserve it (Ou)
So, baby, make me earn it, show me the way you work it
Tell me what you afraid of, I'll spit you my favorite verses
Let's... just go take a breath
I want it all, every ounce of love that you got left
You are my drug, in love to death, feel free to fall, you are a catch
I'm in your heart, I'm in your dream, so fuck the world, it's you and me
She is the only one that got away
If her love don't last forever then forever ain't the same, yeah

[Chorus: Mac Miller, Elle Varner or Both]
Your love is not too kind to me
You know my love is sugar-sweet, yeah
The only thing on my mind is she
You think about you, I've been thinking of me
My love, my love
My love, my love, yeah
And I know that nothin' lasts forever (Nothing lasts forever)
Nothin' lasts forever

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Yeah
And she is cool, calm and collected, I knew that you was the one
When I seen ya, leave me breathless, a-okay, I need a second
Day-to-day, give me attention, I want to take care of you
Marry you, somethin' I'm prepared to do, there can't be two
You was here, I ran from you, scared to take that step
But now that I am ready, you not, you up and left me
Hope your new man make you laugh like I do
I do not mean to worry you with my obsession, I just want to be beside you
I'm too nice, and I had to pay that price
Everything I do is wrong (Wrong,) everything you do is right (Right)
Let's start a family, hold on to forever, baby
Your pussy is a palace and your head is crazy *Woman moans*
That bomb is detonating, look at this mess you're making
I am the king, you are the queen, look at this chess we're playing
Oh we had a love, that love was record-breaking
I'm sick of waitin', yeah

[Chorus: Mac Miller, Elle Varner or Both]
Your love is not too kind to me
You know my love is sugar-sweet, yeah
The only thing on my mind is she
You think about you, I've been thinking of me
My love, my love
My love, my love, yeah
And I know that nothing lasts forever (Nothing lasts forever)
Nothing lasts forever, ever, ever

[Outro: Mac Miller]
So gimme all of your love
And I will be yours, through rain and through shine
Gimme all of your love
You will be mine through rain and through shine
(Gimme your loving, babe) Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Gimme your loving, babe) Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Gimme your loving, babe) Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Gimme your loving, babe) Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Gimme your loving, babe) Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Gimme your loving, babe) Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Gimme your loving, babe) Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Gimme your loving, babe) Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Gimme your loving, babe) Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Gimme your loving, babe) Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Gimme your loving, babe) Yeah, yeah, yeah
(Gimme your loving, babe) Yeah, yeah, yeah
I was 8 yrs old when I first saw you. I couldn’t describe how I felt at that moment. So many emotions. Full of excitement. Full of joy and eagerness. 20 yrs later I understand exactly what that feeling was
INSPIRED

The people that you touched on that small intersection changed lives forever. I told myself I wanted to be a voice for man one day. Whoever knew I was speaking out loud for u to listen

Thank you

[Verse 1: Jake]
I scream your name
As blood bursts from my veins
In our darkest age
The blood bursts from my veins
Crawling out of the sewers
Crimson red
I'm calling out
To the walking dead

[Chorus: Jake]
This is my home
This is my only way
This is my home
This is my only way
This is my home
This is my only way
This is my home
This is my only way home
Home

[Bridge: Jake]
Oh, the sun has died
Face toward the halocline
We all have died
We all are the halocline
Singing out

[Chorus: Jake, All]
This is our home
This is our only way
This is our home
This is our only way
This is our home
This is our only way
This is our home
This is our only way
This is our home
This is our only way
This is our home
This is our only way
This is our home
This is our only way
This is our home
This is our only way
This is our home
This is our only way
This is our home, home, home
This is our home
This is our only way
This is our home, home, home

[Outro: All]
Home, home, home, home
Home, home, home, home

[Verse 1]
Lately, you hold your tongue and don't make a scene
But I see through the façade
See the queen behind the guard
Gently, you mask the fact that you disagree
Dealt a hand without your card
Had the joker from the start

[Pre-Chorus]
You're yearning, wearing thin
Searching for something

[Chorus]
I know what you're hiding but they can't see what you've got
What you've got, baby, what you've got, baby
Quit crying and stop trying to be someone you're not
What you're not baby, what you're not baby
Maybe you can't see
Oh, you're the masterpiece

[Verse 2]
In time, you'll see the colours through your own eyes
You could take the perfect shot
Show the people what you've got
A far cry from insecurity and demise
When your tears come to a stop
You can look down from the top

[Pre-Chorus]
You're yearning, wearing thin
Searching for something

[Chorus]
I know what you're hiding but they can't see what you've got
What you've got, baby, what you've got, baby
Quit crying and stop trying to be someone you're not
What you're not baby, what you're not baby
Maybe you can't see
Oh you're the masterpiece

[Outro]
What you got, baby
What you got, baby
What you got, baby
What you got, baby
What you got, baby
What you got, baby
What you got, baby
What you got, baby

[Verse 1]
How can you wait in the wash of the rain?
You're soaked to your feet
Still, you said you'd wait for me

And these days, they grow so old
And I'll never show
I thought they knew
I'm fickle and slow, and I'll never do

[Chorus]
This cool blue water
In this feeling you brought to me
There's a cool blue
Honey, keep it
Whenever you start to leave

[Verse 2]
I was up every night
A phantom of myself, beside
She rattled my bones
(Don't you think I fit the part?)
I'll never grow
It's all that I know

[Pre-Chorus]
These things, they slow
Maybe, they should

[Chorus]
This cool blue water
In this feeling you brought to me
There's a cool blue heart you're keeping
Whenever you start to leave

This cool blue water
In this feeling you brought to me
There's a cool blue heart you're keeping
Whenever you start to leave

[Intro 1]
I'm a hard-fightin' soldier
And I'm on the battlefield
Lord, I'm a hard-fightin' soldier
And I'm on the battlefield
I'm a hard-fightin' soldier
And I'm on the battlefield
I'll keep bringin' soul to Jesus
By the service

[Spoken]
The service
The service?
That I pray
The service is the part...

[Intro 2]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I got something in motion
Something you can't see
It requires devotion
From those who truly believe
This is something you can't touch
This is something you feel, yeah
For some people it's too much
For some people it heals

[Chorus 1]
This music is my healing
This music is my healing
Lord knows I need some healing, Lord
Cause when this world upsets me
This music sets me free, yeah

[Verse 2]
We stand in formation
While they test and they see
They compile information
And try to make us believe
That there is something we can't touch
Something we'll never feel, but
When I feel like it's too much
This music always reveals

[Chorus 2]
This is our healing
This music is our healing
Lord knows we need some healing, yeah
Cause when this world upsets me
This music sets me free

[Bridge]
Lord only knows who will save us, who will save us now, while
They sit back and watch flowers turn to stone
We got this, we got this music (healing)
Yeah, we got this music (healing)
We got this music (healing)
We got this music, this music, yeah
We got this, we got this

[Outro]
We got this
We got this, we got this
(Healing)
Music, music, music
We got this music
We got this
We got this music
We got this music

[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
I got guns in the fucking pan
Hit the band, nigga
AK-47 in the land, hit the dance, nigga
I don't got plans, I just go, go
Like the Roadrunner, where's the coyote?
It's Rocky and T, y'all ain't fucking with me
Please, had niggas singing like, "Stop," like it's Glee
Nigga chill
I'm real, I'm ill
I'm sickle cell

[Interlude: A$AP Rocky]
Wait, hold on, hold on, let me hit 'em with some soft shit

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Hey, beautiful girl
You already know we keep it triller on the side
Got my nigga T on the side
Got the Caddy, that's the ride

[Outro: Tyler, the Creator]
Fuck that nigga, you gon' die
I don't play

[Produced by Disclosure]

[Hook: Sam Smith]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 1: Sam Smith]
Ever since I left the city you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Boy, you got me down, you got me stressed out

[Hook: Sam Smith]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love

[Verse 2: Sam Smith]
Ever since I left the city, you
You and me, we do not get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where we do not belong

[Hook: Sam Smith]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 3: Sam Smith]
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
You should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else
You don't need no one else

[Hook: Sam Smith]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love

Niggas broke out in a goddamn rage
I even think I seen a sawed-off gauge
But homie, I was sent from hell, not heaven
I broke out with a chrome-plated .357
And the name of the game is simply survival
At the end of the night, 10 was dead on arrival
And me and my partners, we was gone like the winds
Police blamed it on the crips or the brims
But some niggas knew in the corner of the dark
Them crazy niggas reside in triangle park
They go by the name of Brunette Zel and Trey
And they belong to the association called EPA

[Intro]
Southside

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Got a 'Rari with the engine in the back
Every neighbor know a nigga servin' crack
Chasing cheese, but I cannot be a rat
Screamin' free Gucci Mane, no Mack  (Bratt, bratt)
I just finished doin' some business with the hat back
I'ma take a nigga head like a snap back
I'ma hit her with this wood, no mousetrap
Take a five-hour rest, ball it catnap

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Treat her like a Bentley, take the top up off that bitch
I got hoes drinkin' syrup like a waffle on that dick
I made all my pockets grow like Pinocchio, lil' bitch
Either way, money'll grow, just know I'm tryna get rich
Baby, I wanna cash out on you in it for my pride
Baby, I bought a Audi and I gave it to my mother
These niggas, they cowards, they won't even kill each other
Even though I got rhymes, I bust shit just like a bubble
Hey I ran up my racks and I’m killin' 'em by the day
Treat her like she got tatted, she covered with Olay
Not a big fan of acne, but she like it in her face
I'm in the West Coast bangin' like I'm in the A

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Got a 'Rari with the engine in the back
Every neighbor know a nigga servin' crack
Chasing cheese, but I cannot be a rat
Screamin' free Gucci Mane, no Mack (Bratt, bratt)
I just finished doin' business with the hat back
I'ma take a nigga head like a snap back
I'ma hit her with this wood, no mousetrap
Take a five-hour rest, ball it catnap

[Verse 2: Yung Ralph]
I just copped the coupe, it came with twin turbo (Rrr!)
Diamonds 'round my neck, they singin' like they Kirko (Ooh)
Thugger got me swung, got drinkin' all this purple (Act')
And I got them billionaires in my circle (Yeah)
So you know I'm thinkin' 'bout coppin' a 'Rari ('Rari)
I got old money like when I played Atari (Racks)
Counted me a million on my DVD (For real)
Coca, cocaina, I got recipes (For real)
Really makin' juggs, I was servin' (Servin')
Cash Money nigga, I know Birdman (Stunna)
I just want the cheddar, I just want the pesos (Racks)
Rich Gang, YSL, came up off that yayo (Crack)

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Got a 'Rari with the engine in the back
Every neighbor know a nigga servin' crack
Chasing cheese, but I cannot be a rat
Screamin' free Gucci Mane, no Mack (Bratt, bratt)
I just finished doin' business with the hat back
I'ma take a nigga head like a snap back
I'ma hit her with this wood, no mousetrap
Take a five-hour rest, ball it catnap

[Intro]
Ricky Racks
Uh, uh, uh
Thugger Thugger
I rock water like a fuckin' whale
Drug got expenses like a fuckin' bill
I like girls, I'm a fuckin' male
Nigga movin' slower than a snail, watch me

[Chorus]
Overdosin', overdosin', overdosin', overdosin'
Overdosin', overdosin' (Yeah)
Overdosin', overdosin', overdosin', overdosin'
Overdosin', overdosin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
The walls are closin', I'm overdosin'
I'm cookin' some fish, she put on some lotion
I'm stackin' that money, I want it the oldest
Bitch, I am a warrior, you know that it's in me
I'm hangin' with players, you know that I'm pimpin'
My son is suspended, can't ride in the Bentley
What's wrong these birds? These birds are trippin'
Four thousand on shoe strings, you know I ain't trippin'
One minute I swerve, baby, call them birds
Tell it right to her face, put that dick in her life today
Thugger bring 'em Benjis to the T
I don't need a door to hand over them keys
Have a white T look like Miskeen
Batter up, polo, saddle up, football tackle, hut
Pussy nigga, caterpillar, Stuart Little, hike
Get fresh, diamonds everywhere, styled by, my Ike
Paris Hilton, Master P Miller, big C member

[Chorus]
Overdosin', overdosin', overdosin', overdosin'
Overdosin', overdosin' (Sheesh)
Overdosin', overdosin', overdosin', overdosin'
Overdosin', overdosin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
I OD, ODB, dirty nose, cocaín'
Neck, ears, wrist, fingers, Aquafina, wreck the Bentley
Bought the Vette, had wreck in that, growin' green like a Chia Pet
Bought a condominium just to smoke in it 'til I vomit and I'm so honest
London just walked in I'm like, "Goddamn, man, I miss my bro" (London on the Track)
Your bitch just walked out with Young Thug, now you like, "Damn I miss my hoe" (Give her back)
I'm the type of nigga that nut on her back end
You the type of nigga that can't miss that hoe
You the type of nigga that kiss her in the mouth after she drank my Olay, ohh
Drink it, drink it, cop a new coupe, yeah, sank it, sank it
Hundred bands ain't a damn thang, I'ma spread it out, need to pay, pay
Catch me riding with your main thing, I'ma feed her bands, no cuff links
I can even say the same thing, my fans geeked up, they on the same page

[Chorus]
Overdosin', overdosin', overdosin', overdosin'
Overdosin', overdosin' (Sheesh)
Overdosin', overdosin', overdosin', overdosin'
Overdosin', overdosin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Right from the start
You were a thief
You stole my heart
And I your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me
That weren't all that pretty
And with every touch you fixed them
Now you've been talking in your sleep, oh, oh
Things you never say to me, oh, oh
Tell me that you've had enough
Of our love, our love

[Pre-Chorus]
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

[Chorus]
Because when it was not being busy
If there's no other like me
Is it just doesn't feel
Maybe you can observe your research
It keeps me entertained for
Not even sure what they've known
If I just give me a reason

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry I don't understand
Where all of this is coming from
I thought that we were fine
(Oh, we had everything)
Your head is running wild again
My dear we still have everythin'
And it's all in your mind
(Yeah, but this is happenin')
You've been havin' real bad dreams, oh, oh
You used to lie so close to me, oh, oh
There's nothing more than empty sheets
Between our love, our love
Oh, our love, our love

[Pre-Chorus]
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
I never stopped
You're still written in the scars on my heart
You're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

[Chorus]
Because when it was not being busy
If there's no other like me
Is it just doesn't feel
Maybe you can observe your research
It keeps me entertained for
Not even sure what they've known
If I just give me a reason

[Bridge]
Oh, tear ducts and rust
I'll fix it for us
We're collecting dust
But our love's enough
You're holding it in
You're pouring a drink
No nothing is as bad as it seems
Well complete

[Pre-Chorus]
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again

[Chorus]
Because when it was not being busy
If there's no other like me
Is it just doesn't feel
Maybe you can observe your research
It keeps me entertained for
Not even sure what they've known
If I just give me a reason

[Intro]
Hey! (And what?)

Oh, she cook the Thugger corn and rice (Sheesh!)
I fuck her fast, within the night (Ah cha!)
I might pour a lot of pints, a lot of Sprite, a lot of ice (Racks)
Two cups stuffed, I need two cups stuffed (Dos)
Ran them bands up, bitch I'm eating, I'm getting bucks (Guap)
Clean a bitch face with the nut, fuck a Puff
Muddy, muddy

[Chorus 1]
Hey, Young Thugger savage, Thugger savage, Thugger savage
I'm a savage, I'ma fuck her like a savage (Uh, uh)
Ooh, she left my building, and she fallin' down my steps
Then she chase a nigga down like a rabbit (Woo, wha?)
I’m stupid flooded with them karats (Wha?)
I got some motherloving karats, what?
I'm a karat (Sheesh, sheesh!)

[Verse 2]
I paid a hundred and fifty for the karats in my chains and my rings (Bling!)
Watches just change, got my ice from Johnny Dang (Blaw!)
No comparing your plain, I got mine from Avianne (Woo!)
Even if you a lame, you bool if you stay in your lane (Stay in your lane)
You can feel my pain, and I don't need no T-Pain (No way)
You got so much pain that you don't need no T-Pain (No way)
Thugger Thugger pain they ain't gon' play with, no way (No way)
I'm gon' bust his brain and mail his ass straight outta state (Swoo)
I'ma pull up right in front your land and take your pint
I'ma pull up on you, point a beam, ready to bake
I'ma pull up tryna run for racks and take them digits (Racks, racks)
I can't find the place, I'm pouring your children down the sink (Damn)
Graw, graw, kow!

[Chorus 2]
Bitch I'm a motherfucking savage, I'm a savage
I'm a savage, I'm a motherfucking savage (On God)
She see them niggas blicky down and wanna fuck me
'Cause she fuck with Thugger Thugger like a karat (Sheesh!)

Gave her the karats (Bling!)

[Verse 3]
I'ma show her love, and she gon' fuck me like a king (Sheesh!)

[Interlude]
Oh my God (Woo!)
Oh, God! (Ahahaha)
Hah! (Ooh, ooh)
Karat!

[Outro]
Karats in my watches, in my jewelry, in my chain (Ah)
Karats on my bosses, twelve-hun' up in my thing (Oh)
Going in their mouth, and then we coming out the south (Ooh)
I'ma fuck that bitch, and then I nutted in her clit ('Skeddit)
I'ma cuff the bitch if she gon' fuck me in the kitchen
I sold too much coke in the eighties
It's my fuckin' fault, I made you crack babies
Now you whine and cold woke me up
Like a wild wolf won't murder his sick pup
Niggas on the net talkin' crazy and reckless
Busters don't know you get laid down for much less
This ain't no game, cuz niggas now we come
.50 cal dum-dum, rubber-grip bear guns
I see you run like diarrhea
Hide behind your fucking bodyguards like little ballerinas
It ain't no thing when them damn things flame
Fully automatic makes the clubs' ears ring
The oldest nigga, true, that means I done it the most
Question is now which pussy want it the most?
Y'all ain't shit to me, never got your G on
Softer than the pillows at the Bed, Bath & Beyond
Your mistake thinking that I'm dead and gone
Ask your mama, I'm bloody in the octagon
I'm iller than Chucky in Child's play
I bench 300 on a bad day
I'm wild like Uganda machetes
You motherfucking with a psychopath, you niggas ain't ready
Cracked my nigga T.I., but they didn't catch me
My silenced P90 sounds like sewing machines
Bugatti Veyron, Plasma Screen
Malibu beach house, lake house, I'm caked out
I come in all blue, I don't know red
And, I don't know throw dough, I make it rain lead
Coked out, I'm boiling bricks in the kitchen
I don't matter If you got it, nigga. Tricking is tricking
Algebraic, I multiply my metaphors
I'm so spa from deep tissues and pedicures
Overload of niggas in ski masks
Westside rider for life, you ain't gotta ask
L.A., home of the triple beam
My niggas run all up in your crib like a S.W.A.T. team
I'll make your SUV lean
Full metal jackets have it rockin' like a raft in rapids
The last nigga in life that you want to meet
Keep talkin' shit on the net, I'll see you in the streets
Artistic as it gets is big Snoop Dogg
So throw a pawn in the lawn
And, let me show you how it's supposed to be
Blow up like a bomb, napalm
Let me show you what it's supposed to be
Now get close to me, these are groceries
File them in the cabinet, stab it, let it go
This is my art form, I'm so original
Like Ice-T, but I don't drip, drop on the floor
Get a ho, get the door
Let 'em know from the door
Here we go, let it ride
Snoopy D-O-double-G, Eastside LBC
Show you how it's supposed to be
Look up at the sky
Do you see the moon and the sun?
It's Snoop D-O-doub
Yes, I am the only one
When it comes to freestyle, boy, I'm so cold
Make a nigga flip to it to a whole 'nother episode
Watch a ho, hit the stroll
Get the money, bring it back
Ice-T got hi wife, sitting in the cadillac
Coco, there you go
Steal the money, steal the show
Snoop D-O-double-G, I told you I'm original

[Verse 1]
You made a promise I won't forget
You were dishonest ever since we met
If I could count the times you told me with love in your voice
That you'd make an honest choice
You'd make an honest choice

[Chorus]
Don't you remember anything that you said?
Forgot the memories that fell through the net
You go on and on
I can sing along cause you're the echo that's in my head
Don't you remember anything that you said?
Forgot the memories that fell through the net
You go on and on
I can sing along cause you're the echo that's in my head

[Verse 2]
Such repetition, cause for concern
I shouldn't listen, but I never learn
If I could count the times you told me with love in your voice
That you'd make an honest choice
That you'd make an honest choice

[Chorus]
Don't you remember anything that you said?
Forgot the memories that fell through the net
You go on and on
I can sing along cause you're the echo that's in my head
Don't you remember anything that you said?
Forgot the memories that fell through the net
You go on and on
I can sing along cause you're the echo that's in my head
Cause you're the echo that's in my head
Cause you're the echo that's in my head

[Bridge]
I've had, I've had enough
Tryna find the space to interrupt
I've had, I've had enough
All the different ways you hold me up
I've had, I've had enough
Tryna find the space to interrupt
I've had, I've had enough
All the different ways you hold me up
Me up, me up, me up, me up
Me up, me up, me up, me up

[Chorus]
Don't you remember anything that you said?
Forgot the memories that fell through the net
You go on and on
I can sing along cause you're the echo that's in my head
Don't you remember anything that you said?
Forgot the memories that fell through the net
You go on and on
I can sing along cause you're the echo that's in my head
Cause you're the echo that's in my head
Cause you're the echo that's in my head

[Verse 1]
The lights are too bright
Let's turn them down and get to work
You're in the limelight
But I'll flip the switch if you prefer

[Pre-Chorus]
You keep acting like you didn't see me
It's alright, I'll sit tight
Interconnected, so don't hide the feeling
I won't fight, it's not right
You keep acting like you didn't see me
It's alright, I'll sit tight
Interconnected, so don't hide the feeling
I won't fight, it's not right

[Chorus]
I'm attracted by the way you move
And now you got me drawn in by the things you knew
And nothing can stop me
I'm disregarding the rules
It comes down to molecules
I'm not looking for the words to say
What you've already heard a hundred times
Too late, I know that you got me
I'm disregarding the rules
It comes down to molecules

[Verse 2]
I know you want me
But I can act like I don't know
It's nearly morning
So grab your coat, it's time to go

[Pre-Chorus]
You keep acting like you didn't see me
It's alright, I'll sit tight
Interconnected, so don't hide the feeling
I won't fight, it's not right
You keep acting like you didn't see me
It's alright, I'll sit tight
Interconnected, so don't hide the feeling
I won't fight, it's not right

[Chorus]
I'm attracted by the way you move
And now you got me drawn in by the things you knew
And nothing can stop me
I'm disregarding the rules
It comes down to molecules
I'm not looking for the words to say
What you've already heard a hundred times
Too late, I know that you got me
I'm disregarding the rules
It comes down to molecules

[Verse 1]
Anytime I'm alone, I'm reliving the moment
Does it enter your mind?
Have I already blown it?

[Pre-Chorus]
Somehow in my head, it's overgrown
It's made me question everything I know
Did what you say contain an undertone?
It goes on and on and on

[Chorus]
It keeps turning up, it won't leave me
Our time together become too short
Did I say enough? Speak freely
Did my words destroy?
Or was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Oh, was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?

[Verse 2]
When you're so hard to read
I wonder what you're hiding
Lying under the leaves
I'm not someone you confide in

[Pre-Chorus]
Somehow in my head, it's overgrown
It's made me question everything I know
Did what you say contain an undertone?
It goes on and on and on

[Chorus]
It keeps turning up, it won't leave me
Our time together become too short
Did I say enough? Speak freely
Did my words destroy?
Or was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Oh, was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Was it just an afterthought?
Afterthought, afterthought

[Outro]
Get this, get this sound
Set this, set this down

[Verse 1]
Man, I got this gold all over me
So automatically she gonna twerk
Now I got these hoes all over me
She know that I be puttin' in work
Blowing up that soul and Hennessy
Spilling bad right now, trying to make it all work
Walk up in the fucking club like I'm Mr. Universe
Pop a rock, take a shot, and I'm lifting up her skirt
My pockets on infinity, you feeling me
Shorty get low in skinny jeans, let's go, get really deep
She coming at me til my voice get low like Billy Dean

[Yeah - silly me]
Every time she step the dance floor glow like Billie Jean
But I don't give a fuck right now cause I'm pretty stuck right now

[Bridge]
Man it look like she walking down a lonely highway
She's coming to a real nigga table
I'm coming at you real, no thicker
I'm gonna make her feel good
Shorty sweating over my way
Baby, I'm gonna keep it real
You gonna make me feel like
I just walked up in this spot with a drink in my cup
I got me a thot with a real big butt
I'm not gonna stop 'til I get enough
So shots on shots

[Hook]
Tear the roof off the mothafucker
Light the roof on fye
Tear the roof off the mothafucker
Light the roof on fye
Tear the roof off the mothafucker
Light the roof on fye
Tear the roof off the mothafucker
Light the roof on fye

[Verse 2]
All I really need is one of me
Cause automatically I'm going first
Shorty got her team in front of me
She's tryna make me put in that work
I'm tryna keep my feet up under me
I'm pretty drunk right now, everything is in reverse
Pullin' out the iPhone, let me get the number first
I'll take you to my home, then I put her in a hearse
I be throwin' that beer redundantly
Suddenly I can really see she wantin' me
I can't believe she thought I was KD the way I leave and dunk on it
Now she stuck on it
She said, "it's all free, baby you can keep your money, G."
Cause she don't give a fuck right now
She walking to my truck right now

[Bridge]
Man it look like she walking down a lonely highway
She's coming to a real nigga table
I'm coming at you real, no thicker
I'm gonna make her feel good
Shorty sweating over my way
Baby, I'm gonna keep it real
You gonna make me feel like
I just walked up in this spot with a drink up in my cup
I got me a thot with a real big butt
I'm not gonna stop 'til I get enough
So shots on shots

On the corner fuckin' with the felons
Wishin' for the Honda Civic
Pacin', smokin' outta staircases in the ceilin'
Dawg, I just want a new job
Want my old girl to get a boob job
Want my new girl to get a new job
Yellin', "2Pac, 2Pac, 2Pac"
Two Glocks strapped all up on my waist
For any nigga trippin' around my way
Mini Mac, strapped for haters in the back
In this mini black JanSport backpack
Nigga, matter fact, uh
Rollin' blunts with my nigga Rocky
All we do is go, all we do is go, all we do is go
No, no, ain't shit can stop me

[Verse 2]
Wait, niggas hatin' on me like I ain't pay for it, I ain't slave for it
Wasn't workin' night to night to day for it
Had to wait for it, had to spend a couple extra days for it
Bitch, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
Couple bitches that go hand in head
I'm talkin', hoe and hoe and hoe and hoe, wait
Hoe and hoe and hoe and hoe and hoe

Two friends for my two dawgs
See I love a bitch that got a few flaws
Show my old bitches to my new broads

New flows, cars, clothes
Bentley whip, Ferrari doors
I'm Ari Gold in Entourage
I'm fuckin' hoes that's on your squad, uh

Hate to be the reason
Why your dream bitches never get to see ya
Never, ever, ever, ever, ever
Me forever, ever, ever, ever, ever?
Hell yeah, niggas jealous of us
Gettin' hella, hella, hella, hella chedder
Got an elevator in my Hella Yela
Women love me like I'm on the Ellen show
Hella bars for my felon flow
Niggas hella hard hearin' blind to 'em
Gotta hit 'em with that Helen Keller flow
I fucked a lot of bitches, Lord forgive me
Father God, know I did a lot of sinnin'
Now, I'm watchin' every one of my decisions
'Cause I know the fact that even though I’m livin’
Nigga livin’ under 'only God conditions'
So in my position
Gotta mob on the competition
Gotta squab on the opposition
Audemaur got me fuckin’ every damn bitch in there like
“Dawg, dawg, I got all the bitches”
Subtractin’ all you weak hoes
Stack money, money 'til it's all addition, wait

[Chorus]
I, I don't be stressin' these hoes
I just pour liquor for niggas, that's it
I do not fuck with you though
You shitted on me
And I can't wait to blow on you
I can't wait to blow on you
I can't wait to blow
I can't wait to blow on you
I can't wait to blow on you

When I was younger
My days looked brighter
When you were around
You made me stronger
When you told me

[Chorus 1]
Everywhere you go
Just know that you're a star

[Verse 2]
As we grow older
I become wiser
I won't let you down
(I won't let you down)

[Chorus 1]
Everywhere you go
Just know that you're a star

[Bridge]

[Chorus 2]
Some will try to shake you

[Refrain]
Everywhere you go

[Intro]
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
It's been one of those days
Where things don't go my way
Ooh, and it seems like always
The thing to blame is my ways

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You're the one I'm thinkin' of
The one I'm dreamin' of

[Chorus 1]
You are my lady
I am your man
Some call it crazy, but
They don't understand

[Verse 2]
When I'm gone
Baby, I'm always gone too long
That don't get your mind to wonderin'
If I still care, 'cause, baby, I still care

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You're the one I'm thinkin' of
The one I'm dreamin' of is you

[Chorus 1]
You are my lady
I am your man
Some call it crazy, but
They don't understand

[Bridge]
Our love (ooh, ooh)

Come on, babe (ooh, ooh)

Come on, babe (ooh, ooh)

Some call it crazy, baby
But they don't understand

[Outro]
This is our love
Yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on, girl
Let me be your man
Keep it together, babe
They don't have to understand
Our love
I wanna get to you without leaving
I wanna get by without us thinkin'
Lemme get nothing just for love
Now I got a honey on my finger

[Verse 1]
Am I listening when you tell me, baby
I hate to see you doin' like this
'Cause these things they take some time
To realize the other way still exists
But maybe it’s the time
I said
You’re doing just fine
Really
Maybe I’m
Making poor decisions

[Verse 2]
Is this really what you wanted for
A key to a perfect life of success
And my jacket and the stereo-oh
And my zipper’s ridin' like this
To make a little chime
That rings
Maybe then you’ll take a listen
In your mind
You can feel
The difference

[Verse 1]
Pasta simmers on the stove in June
Makes no sense yet but it will soon
Conversation starters come way too hard
Nobody wants to be the martyr playing the wrong cards
Why did you come to this planet? Why did you come to this life?
How can you be everybody's dream and still be somebody's wife?
Tell me, what did you have for lunch today?
That's right how would I know?
How would I know?

[Verse 2]
You're off somewhere being free
While I starve, in the lonesome cold
Our bodies got used to each other
Now they are used to the sound
Of Richie Havens' voice on the vinyl spinnin' round and round
Round and round​
Sometimes I feel like I was born way too late
Should have been born on the Woodstock stage
But I'm just here waiting and waiting and waiting

[Verse 3]
Somebody famous had a birthday today
But all eye saw was another full moon
What's that?
Something' Burnin' on the stove
It must be the pasta, it must be the Pasta
Oh yeah, it's June

[Chorus]
I'll fuck your bitch and she ain't comin' back wodie
Got swag and a whole lotta cash wodie

Wodats turn up

[Verse 1]
Been a hot boy, 5-0-4
But I'm little Haiti's B-E-O
Bitch tried to fuck me first, no N-O
I need super dome first, no N-O
No kinfolk, cause I fuck her 'til she turtle like Lorenzo
I don't play no games, not 'tendo
Niggas couldn't be me with a thugger scope
But on another note
I would like to marry your wife
But I wouldn't like to pay the price, that's why I think twice
Nah, I think nice
So if you think once, I'll think thrice
You heard me?

[Chorus]
I'll fuck your bitch and she ain't comin' back wodie
Got swag and a whole lotta cash wodie
Them niggas that behind me, they tote gats wodie
And them niggas that's behind me ain't the last wodie, wodie
Wodats turn up

Got cash? Throw up, wodie
Wodats turn up
Got gas? Burn up

[Verse 2]
Pullin' up on Bleveland, might ruin your evenin'
We street like the cement, even during

These haters still up with it, give him cooties you stuck with it
Boss the iced out pieces, gave me so I could bust with 'em
I only perform for cheese, my flyest go to Pizza Hut with 'em
I still eat at Mickey D's, cause they got sluts in 'em
Nigga I caught your bitch on the street, she got a little mutt in her
And I'm gonna marry your wife
Just to make you think twice, and you won't look nice
You's a mean faced bastard
But how you gon' rush Casper?

[Chorus]
I'll fuck your bitch and she ain't comin' back wodie
Got swag and a whole lotta cash wodie
Them niggas that behind me, they tote gats wodie
And them niggas that's behind me ain't the last wodie, wodie
Wodats turn up
Got gas? Burn up
Got cash? Throw up, wodie
Wodats turn up
Got gas? Burn up
Got cash? Throw up, up

Conversation with Guap, Guap is the perp
They gon' hate on me, I know that
Cause I got Freebandz and you ain't got no racks
You pick your own number in my trap
I plug prices, niggas hate that
I got foreign whips, niggas hate that
Every time I see a hater, I throw some free racks

[Chorus: Young Thug]
These niggas, we ain't gon' play with them, we gon' spray on them
All their bitches, we gon' lay on them and stay on them
Now we're Freebandz, we gon' play with them
You can call the Guap and me, we still play with them
Now we're gym too, we gon' stay on them
These fuck niggas, they hatin', but we loaded
They talkin' cabbage, we showed it
We ran up and we blowed it and got it right back
I said these niggas hatin' but we love that
They talkin' cash, but we showed that
We ran it up and we blowed it and got it right back, yeah

[Chorus]
You're a natural, you're a natural
You're a natural, you're a nat, you're a nat
You're a natural, you're a natural
You're a nat girl, nat-nat, let me through
Bae you are so cute
Bae you go through

[Verse 1]
And that thing wetter than a squid
And that thing cleaner than a kid
I am lookin' for her forensics
Creepin', crawlin' in that GT bitch
My money taller than the world's tallest bitch
Got a foreign ho, she gone buy whips
She trained to get it
She love my pimpin
I told her bring it all
And that's the protocol
Last night I had a dream you probably wouldn't catch
I died from bein' outerspace without the hat
Astronaut Status over this way
A1FBG Young Scooter, ayy

[Chorus]
You're a natural, you're a natural
You're a natural, you're a nat, you're a nat
You're a natural, you're a natural
You're a nat girl, nat-nat, let me through
Bae you are so cute

Any time you want it, you can get it
No ticket

No one disrespect it
You gone lose your blessin'

The fuck you mean?
Get on this team
Ride a couple things
Suck a couple things
And you in, you can't do nothin' but win
Cause all we count is millions

[Chorus]
You're a natural, you're a natural
You're a natural, you're a nat, you're a nat

And if you stay true, they might carry you

[Chorus]
You're a natural, you're a natural

Epic, epic, epic, epic, epic, epic
Turnin' up, no turnin' down
Epic, epic, epic, epic, epic, epic
Turnin' up, no turnin' down

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I'm a motherfuckin' martian
Spend a whole mil on my closet
Try to sign me for 1.5? Only put 500 on marketing
What the fuck is you talkin'?
Baby my whole crew, we're the bosses
Baby my whole crew really flexin'
Baby your whole crew just barkin'
Whew, my pinky ring came from Venus
Whew, my earlobe paid with Serena
Whew, yeah, we fiendin'

They'll wet a nigga up that Katrina
Uh, okay, check me how, how I ride the beat

20 years old with an old soul, I survived the streets
No apology
Young Future, she noticed me
Cause her boyfriend not cold as me
I guess my jewelry mean somethin' like it's a trophy

[Chorus: Curt Blow]
She say she like my Audemar
Beemer coupe, take off the top, baby no Mardi Gras

Get so much dope money nigga I ain't got time for livin'
And my big coupe but forgot the top

In South Beach on Ocean Drive
I got goons with me and they bleed that five
Spent 500 on some Robin Jeans
Got a groupie bitch, she'll fuck team
Got three main, no (?)
Not turned up to the MAS
Spent 500 in LAX

[Verse 3: Tizzle]
Have you ever counted 200,000?
Straight cash in a project house
And these school boys would know nothin' about it
FN on the Holy Bible
Paranoia won't take a shower
Spent 50 bands in a cool hour
I'll drop the top man word law
Sellin' dope, she knew double R
Smokin' kush blunts while I double cup
Louie belt hold the pants up
Duffle bag with that tan stuff
Got two spots rollin' like the blunt
But that Zone 3 what I represent
Red beam in my residence
Protect it up like the president
Say the wrong word and gone kill shit
MMG what I represent
125 where I live with
Still hand in hand with that white shit
Big bells and them clean bricks
Turn a regular bitch to a bad bitch
Drink a whole nine to half a brick
Turn a rental car to an M6
Nigga I been rich

[Chorus: Curt Blow]
She say she like my Audemar
Beemer coupe, take off the top, baby no Mardi Gras
Standin' in this kush with all this cash on me
I got goons in this bitch with red rags on 'em

[Prophet]
Yeaaaah... Aftermath... D.R.E

[Verse 1: Prophet]
It ain't too much I haven't seen
Touched or been through
Always on the move so I'm sorry if I offend you
But I got million dollar deals to attend to
Time is money and I don't have a second to lend you
I am the one with the empire to run
West Coast messiah, best known for fire
Throw up your sets loc, the chronic smoke retired
No more lowriders and golden spokes on tires?
SSTOOOP! I just had to detox
Now I'm back on the block like classic Reeboks
As the beat knocks you can put it in the air
Couple of my artists beefing but I wouldn't interfere
My style is innovation, trials and tribulations
You can't rush perfection so thanks for your patience
Got on my troops, assembled in groups ready to shoot
Dressed in bulletproof khaki suits like that...

[Chorus]
It's like that, these cats are sick without me
When you need the medicine who they tell you to go see?
Never seen all you looking so lonely
But the Doc's office is open, prescribing you what you need
Got my patients out there waiting, the line is out the door
It's a dose of what you folks have been out there looking for...

[Verse 2: Prophet]
It ain't another nigga that can play how I play
Who else can take a longer hiatus, get shot dead
Come back and blow the scene up, sorta like Bombay
You on the road to success but you're going the wrong way
What up Mo, I'm California's own, homegrown
Light up and zone and smoke out till your brains blown
Me and Nate Dogg, on the same song
Now that's something you can definitely bank on
Tell me have you seen a, producer that's meaner
On beats I'm a beast, like Toto Riina
I had my fair share of courtroom subpoenas
Now, trying to live my life a little bit cleaner
Change is what I had to do
I used to be a ruthless nigga with a attitude
Made a lot of dough, then got senses to life on death row
I won my appeal, and drove off on three wheels, like that...

[Chorus]
It's like that, these cats are sick without me
When you need the medicine who they tell you to go see?
Never seen all you looking so lonely
But the Doc's office is open, prescribing you what you need
Got my patients out there waiting, the line is out the door
It's a dose of what you folks have been out there looking for...

[Verse 3: Prophet]
Compton's full of armed thieves and G's that'll do ya
So please don't let the palm trees and cool breeze fool ya
Y'all heard it first here, I've birthed the careers
Of almost every hot rapper in the past 20 years
You would think dudes happily would name a school after me
But instead they see me at events and start attacking me
But my faculty is standing right in back of me
You must like sipping food through a straw like a daiquiri
Come on, man... who you pretending to touch?
When the shit goes down, I don't gotta do much
Buck, poke a hole in him, like a stem in a dutch
We ain't tough nahhh... we just defending what's us
I got a lot to lose, the drop-tops, yachts and jewels
That's why I spot the fool, trying to stop my moves
I'm not takin' losses, I hang with bosses
That can buy anything, like fuck what the cost is
It's like that...

[Chorus]
It's like that, these cats are sick without me
When you need the medicine who they tell you to go see?
Never seen all you looking so lonely
But the Doc's office is open, prescribing you what you need
Got my patients out there waiting, the line is out the door
It's a dose of what you folks have been out there looking for...

[Intro]
You ready?
This could be us
This this this could be

[Verse 1]
You, you say you ain't ready
Ready to go steady, you ain't ready for us
'Cause what I got make you weak in the knees
Take your energy, make you sleep for a week
Sex with me ain't enough
That's why we gotta do it, metaphysically

[Chorus]
This could be us
This could be us
This could be us
This could be us

[Verse 2]
I, I know you're lovin' your freedom
'Cause your freedom, is paying your bills
(Yes it is)
Boyfriends, you think you don't need 'em
But in the middle of the cold, cold night
I think you will
Show you right

[Chorus]
This could be us
Yes
But you be playin'
This could be us
Sho nuff could be
But you keep on fooling around
You know you want me like a new pair of shoes
This could be us
This could be us

[Interlude]
You ready? No you ain't ready

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
This could be us
This could be us
This could be us
You know you want me like...
This could be us
This could be us
You know you want me like...
This could be us

[Verse 1]
My fire through cold nights
The brightest of all lights
You are my home
Wherever we go
Oh whoa oh

We don't need a thing under the tree
You're giving me all I need, yeah

And my heart can't stop singing
You can't fight this feeling
Unspeakable joy
Ringing through my soul
Oh whoa oh

[Pre-Chorus]
We don't need a thing under the tree
You're giving me all I need

[Chorus]
Every day is a holiday (Holiday)
When you're the reason to celebrate (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Every day is a holiday (Ooh-ooh)
When you're the reason
Every day is a holiday (Every day is a holiday)
When you're the reason to celebrate (You are the reason)
Every day is a holiday (Oh whoa)
When you're the reason, you are the reason

[Bridge]
We don't need a thing, oh, under the tree
'Cause you give me all I need, hey

[Chorus]
Every day is a holiday (Every day, now)
When you're the reason to celebrate (You're the reason, baby)
Every day is a holiday (Oh)
When you're the reason, when you're the reason (Woo!)
Every day is a holiday (Every day, yeah)
When you're the reason to celebrate (Yeah, baby)
Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason
(Why don't you meet me in the wings cause I

F there's a question of my heart, you've got it
It don't belong to anyone but you
If there's a question of my love, you've got it
Baby, don't worry, I've got plans for you, yeah
Baby, I've been making plans of love
Baby, I've been making plans for you, yeah
Baby, I've been making plans
Baby, I've been making plans for you

My sincerest apologies, I mean it
I'll admit it, all being pathetic
I'm in my late 20s still never been to a wedding
Guess the idea of that lobby empty do not sit with me well
It’s not your fault they try to get me, cause I'ma need to sail
Cause I'm selfish and I need you to myself
Tryna see you afloat but don't wanna see you on sale
Cause I failed and see you bout to cry
Cause when I enter they city they leave without they pride
I'm sorry, and you starin' at my comments
Fearin' it's gone always be you sharin' me with all them
Wrong, how dare I say ignore them?
Preparing for that day, I leave you here and switch you for them
It's hard, you know temptation and all
Out here tryna see if my relationship's strong
Get a place in the charts or runaway from your heart
Gave this music my all, nothing is sacred no more
I'm wrong
But I'm promisin' you better though
And your friends sayin' let him go
And we ain't gettin' any younger
I can give up now but I can promise you forever though
(realest shit I ever wrote?
(realest shit I ever wrote, if you ever knew love)

I’ll admit it, let me be hypothetic
The day I find a woman I probably be scared to share it
The idea of me finding love would run somebody off
And true my wall could use some plaques but still I got the flaws
Brush you off, yeah I'm kinda lost
Now I'm up in the club with a couple of Move On's
I'M DARK, GOOD NIGGA, troubled heart
Went from fallin' in love to drunk and fallin' apart
This is hard, tryna find some time to move on
Cause when we lost our baby, I got shady SHIT got too dark
I'M SORRY. And I thank you baby, you strong
My ex before you married to, you solo I say so long
Nah, good terms how that ended
But it surely put a dent on how I worry about this business
Off white picket fences, ON flights with the children
On site stealin' kisses on off nights my intentions
But, I plan to do it better though
But you still sayin' let it go
We ain't gettin' any younger
Women love me now but in your eyes we forever though

[Intro]
What we gonna do with you
We got everything to lose with you, so
What are we gonna do with you

[Verse 1]
I'm not out to steal your money
I don't wanna take your time
I do deserve a little respect, so
I'm gonna get what is mine, 'cause, yeah
Seem like old news, the whole world gone crazy
What am I gonna do
What am I gonna tell my babies, when
They don't understand
My pressure my struggle, my demands,  yeah
Back then, I didn't understand when my pops came home saying
That he couldn't take it, but
It's hard to be a good man knowing that a man's plan
Is to take what you making

[Chorus]
Hold on, we're gonna make it, yeah
Hold on, we're gonna make it, yeah
Hold on, we're gonna make it, yeah
Hold on, we're gonna make it, yeah

[Verse 2]
Seem like new news
Is the old news from a different angle
Another mother on TV
Crying 'cause her boy didn't make it
She sayin' "what am I gonna do?"
"What am I gonna tell these babies?"
Yeah, y'all dont understand
Oh no, y'all don't understand
What are we gonna do with you?

[Chorus]
Hold on, we're gonna make it, yeah
Hold on, we're gonna make it, yeah
Hold on, we're gonna make it, yeah
Hold on, we're gonna make it, yeah

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
Come on
Yeah
God bless your soul, child
Yeah

[Verse 1: Jake]
And I could not tell by the power of
The prophet spit fire all through your blood
If Jesus had brothers like I do here
Then walking on water is a blissful fear

[Verse 2: Jake]
The demons and lions bow their heads in shame
The devil appeared and the Bible came
You baptize my grief with a kiss of grace
Then cut off my ears and I feel no pain

[Verse 3: Jake]
The pictures are plagued with amazing grace
And Mary held liquor, so passionate
I kill a man, with fists, so he knew me well

[Chorus: Jake]
It's like home, it's like home, it's like home, hey
It's like home, it's like home, it's like home, hey
It's like home, it's like home, it's like home, hey
It's like home, hey
It's like home, hey
It's like home, it's like home, it's like home, hey

[Bridge: Jake]
I've seen it all
It's poetry, it's poetry, it's close to gold
It's poetry, it's poetry, it's close to gold
It's gold, it's gold, it's gold
I've seen it all
It's poetry, it's poetry, it's close to gold
It's poetry, it's poetry, it's close to gold
It's gold, it's gold, it's gold
I've seen it all
It's poetry, it's poetry, it's close to gold
It's poetry, it's poetry, it's close to gold
It's gold, it's gold, it's gold

[Outro: All]
And I could not tell by the power of
The prophets spit fire all through your blood
If Jesus had brothers like I do here
Then walking on water is a blissful fear

[Verse 1]
Where I come from
I've seen things that you wouldn't believe
But once your heart is there, you can never leave
I wrote this here for everyone to see
It was calling me, kept calling me

[Pre-Chorus]
Even in darkness
Me and my fam from the dungeon found that light
And even in darkness
Despite what was wrong, everything's gonna be alright

[Chorus]
Said whoa, when it gets real cold
We got fire and that's music to my soul
Said whoa, when the lights get low
We burn brighter and that's music to my soul
Even in darkness

[Verse 2]
Well look at me now, I'm everything that I wanted to be
But once your heart is there, you can never leave
A star in the sky for everyone to see
You can follow me, follow me

[Pre-Chorus]
Even in darkness
Me and my fam from the dungeon found that light
And even in darkness
Despite what was wrong, everything turned out alright

[Chorus]
Said whoa, when it gets real cold
We got fire and that's music to my soul
Said whoa, when the lights get low
We burn brighter and that's music to my soul

[Bridge]
Well we got Jo and Mo and Gipp and 'Lo
And yes Big Rube, and Backbone, Organ No is Pat, Rico and Ray
And we've got the Witchdoctor and yes Cool Breeze
And all the young homies from the dungeon east
I can't forget my brothers, Big and Dre

[Pre-Chorus]
Even in darkness
Me and my fam from the dungeon found that light
And even in darkness
Despite what was wrong, everything turned out alright

[Chorus]
Said whoa, when it gets real cold
We got fire and that's music to my soul
Said whoa, when the lights get low
We burn brighter and that's music to my soul
Said whoa, when it gets real cold
We got fire and that's music to my soul
Said whoa, when the lights get low
We burn brighter and that's music to my soul
Said whoa

[Snippet]
Smile though you heart is aching
Smile even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by
If you smile through your fears and sorrows
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll see the sun come shining through
If you just smile

[Verse 1]
Laura is learning how to love
See, can't you see
It hurts to see her go
To parties all alone

[Chorus]
And I hope they bring back Elvis
And all the stars of the past
Together at last
For a cover show
And we can make it last
On the Flaming Star

[Verse 2]
The first word
And the word is let
They never let you learn
To be you right 'em all (?)
Except the word can still be

[Bridge]
Light up and colour-code your old LPs
They never turn no more
It's just a garage door that rattles to the floor
Every morning is separating, you and Caroline again
The look in your eyes, it looks just like the twilight of your life

[Verse 3]
Now you're stone cold tired
And your wife is getting high with your daughter
And another guy in the starlight

[Chorus]
And I hope they bring back Elvis
And all the stars of the past
Together at last
For a cover show
And we can make it last
On the Flaming Star

[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Jesus, somebody call my shrink cause i think i'm about to have a fucking seizure
I forgot half this fucking verse, i'm guessing my brain have amnesia
Cause all my brain cells are living single like a deja
Rapping - stop it
Open - lock it
You niggas come short like fucking hobbits
I kidnapped a manager and robed it
I choked the motherfucker like batman and Robin
Then eat batskin and Robin
My girlfriend Islamic
Make it eat my pork fork spoon
In a room with pianos and balloons, i'l walk away with mushrooms
My girlfriend's a hippy
I bet i feed that motherfucker line like i'm Britney
You faggots are sissies
I'm shitty - y'all pissy
I run this shit, how the fuck you niggas skip me?
Even emo bitches want to slit me
I'm a bass drum - kick me

[Intro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Ooh, she wants me
But she won't give it away
So she taunts me
I'm too cool to play

[Chorus 1]
'Cause I gave her my heart and soul
She wants more
She tells me that she loves me
And I can't lie, I want her, but I will shoot her down

[Verse 2]
I'm cold-blooded
Got to keep moving
Moving on
It's gone too far
Woah, girl, for way, way too long

[Chorus 2]
I gave you my heart and soul
What more could you want
I know that you love me
You know that I want you, but I will shoot you down

[Bridge]
Hey, is that you outside my home
Girl you done got me terrified
Why don't you leave me alone
Your craziness is verified
It's kinda scary
Please, please
Please, please just leave me alone

[Chorus 3]
I done gave it all
What more, what more could you want
I know that you love me
I don't want to, but I got to shoot you down

[Outro]
Cold-blooded
I'm tired
I'm tired

[Verse 1]
3 A.M. and my neighbors hate me
Music blasting, shaking these walls
This time Mary Jane won't save me
I've been working later, I've been drinking stronger
I've been smoking deeper but the memories won't stop

[Chorus]
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

[Verse 2]
Like poison coursing through me
So clear my vision is blurred
The haze won't put my mind at ease
I've been sleeping later, I've been breathing stronger
I've been digging deeper, but the memories won't stop

[Chorus]
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

[Bridge]
I want you all
Say it before you run out of time
I want you all
Say it before it's too late
I want you all
Say what I am feeling now
I want you all
Waiting is insane

[Chorus]
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
Well, I'm bound to lose, bound to win
Bound to walk this road again
Bound to lose, bound to win
Bound to walkin' this road again

I'm just one of those ramblin' men
Ramblin' since I don't know when
Here I come and I'ma gone again
You might think I've got no end
Bound to lose, bound to win
Bound to walkin' this road again
I could have you up in arms
And I could have you singing
I'm a confident speaker
I could tell you anything

I was standing on the table
Legs by the light right near the window
I could see them walking past
They were laughing
No one we know

Ooooh
Ooooh
Ooooh

They caught me by the ankles and they shook me out
My brain is fuzzy
I'm a sugar coated pill and I'm a pick me up
And put me down again

They hollowed me out
Wore me like a glove
I shook so many hands
I've been dreaming of
You can use my rib cage as a pillow
It doesn't suit me
I feel flimsy when I grin
Like a stretched out piece of skin

You can beat the dust straight out of me
I'll come clean in the end
I really like the yellow 'round the edges
Of my bruises as they mend

Ooooh
Ooooh
Ooooh

They took me by the ankles and they shook me out
My brain turned fuzzy
I'm a sugar coated pill and I'm a pick me up
And put me down again

They hollowed me out
Wore me like a glove
I shook so many hands
I've been dreaming of

[Verse 1]
Back down to the water front
Sunlit hue to keep my body warm
I guess you love this man, I couldn't tell
It's the cold wet hand against my mother's spell

[Chorus]
Water bring my body in
I know she loves me through thick and thin

[Verse 2]
Slip into the water front
With your heart in your bag and your shoes taken off
I was so unsure you ever had the gall
Don't you understand I didn't need it at all

[Chorus]
Water bring my body in
I know she loves me through thick and thin
Current come pull me down
I won't take a breath, I wanna drown

[Bridge]
And I call on the water to clean
The remains of the dirt that it leaves
To be brave and alert and pristine
There's a stain in the heart of me

[Chorus]
Water bring my body in
I know she loves me through thick and thin
Current come pull me down
I won't take a breath, I wanna drown

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Yessir
D & DMG
We Tripping man (Yeah ooh ooh)

DIV is where you find me at
Higher than the seats on my private jet
Four door Lambo I’m buying that
I’m mad cuz them bitches ain’t designed it yet
I’m smoking on loud tell them bitches be quiet
If a nigga keep hating, he gonna make me start a riot
Could’ve bought a house but I spent it on a ride
And if I get any higher I’m a really start flying
Tell me what you know about that Taylor Gang shit
We be popping champagne just to pour it on our bitches
Leave the club with a girl I ain’t never gonna forget
She slob on my knob but she don’t spit
Get trippy as I roll out with my niggas out in Dallas
Look at Juicy J, he balling like the Mavericks
Me and all my niggas, and a bunch of automatics
If a nigga roll up on me, I’m a let a nigga have it

[Hook: Bob Marley]
Come on and stir it up, I would say little darling
Let’s stir it up, come on baby (we tripping man)
Come on and stir it up, yeah little darling
Stir it up, woah

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Jet Life, Jet Life
Turbo charged bars, slide cars on tracks falling off gang stars
In these rap wars, ain’t nothing band aids won’t cover
Touring with seven deep coverage, live bands two buses
My own cash no budget, no major label fundings Jets baby
We went from crawling to walking to running you can’t say nothing
You undergag order, hopping out of Audis hurting y’all with kicks
I’m the Transporter, think about it never mind, you ain’t gotta
I’m already on some whole other, word to your motherfucking self
Nobody else gonna do it for you, nobody else every night
Then someone will offer you help but they ain’t doing nothing
Till they really see you trying to do something, I ain’t bluffing
Kush puffing, on you jive turkeys, stuffing stocking with these gifts…

[Hook: Bob Marley]
Come on and stir it up, I would say little darling
Let’s stir it up, come on baby
Come on and stir it up, uh yeah little darling
Stir it up, woah

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Taylor, uh
Top floor, 454 fully restored, nice wheels red bottoms galore
Being honest they don’t make ‘em like you anymore
We the hottest in my, keep me the calmest
We’ll be dancing with the stars and throwing peace signs at the comets
We’ll be posing for the cameras when they bring us on the carpet
Eating breakfast in the morning while we reading all the comments, like
Ooh girl, oh man y’all see her
Got me like I’m a spend my whole life with you
And make the perfect wife out you, and now them other…

[Hook: Bob Marley]
Come on and stir it up, I would say little darling
Let’s stir it up, come on baby
Come on and stir it up, yeah little darling
Stir it up, woah, ohh ohh
We Trippy Man

She would know what to do
'Cuz baby I'm in need of something
And if anybody knows it’s you
What I should be doin' with my feelings

Do you think that I just need to move this body? Oh!

Baby, you know that I'm shy
Maybe if you ask we could dance all night
Baby, you know that I'm shy
Maybe if you ask we could dance all night

Tryin'a make my way through the bodies
The sweat is soakin' through my clothes
Walkin' to the door when she saw me
With all the secrets that she knows
So she takes my hand, I feel nervous
'Cuz movin’s what she plans to do
Whispered in my ear and I heard it
"I think you just need to move your body, oh!”

Baby, you know that I'm shy
Maybe if you ask we could dance all night
Baby, you know that I'm shy
Maybe if you ask we could dance all night
Baby, you know that I'm shy
Maybe if you ask we could dance all night
Baby, you know that I'm shy
Maybe if you ask we could dance all night

“Hey baby, you wanna come dance with me?
I think you’d might like it
It's not so hard. Come on”

You’ll miss the golden moment when everything aligned
Did it go on underground without a soul around?
Don’t that make you wonder how God found the time?

We’re always waiting around for Grace
To put a smile upon her race
Well, I'm sure she’s got a pretty face than in the world

Well, it’s a real big place, your hands on mine
You know it happens honey all the time
Well, my hands going wild, well it wouldn't be wrong even if I tried
Tired of these goodbyes, tired of all these weeping eyes
Tired of being tired of the process of being tired, of you being tired of me
I'm tired, tired, tired (tired, tired, tired), tired

We’re always waiting around for Grace
To put a smile upon her race
Well, I'm sure she’s got a pretty face in the world

Well, it’s a real big place, your hands on mine, you know
We’re always waiting around for Grace
To put a smile upon her race

In the world, in the world, in the world

[Intro]
Yeah
Let, let, let, let, let, let, let, let, let
Let, let, let, let, let, let
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Let, let, let, let, let's get started
Nobody wanna be themselves, everyone's an artist
Walk around with a target on my head, take your best shot
Watch me do my thing, try and shoot me from the press box
We keep on goin' 'til they press stop
Errr-Errr, I'm breakin' records, so rewind
I left you scared, say a prayer, put it on the Holy Bible
Better hold a microphone like how a soldier hold a rifle
It's the Young Mac, I been there and done that
Went away, then come back with a motherfuckin' vengeance
I'm collectin', every sentence is impressive, learnin' lessons from the legends
Dreams is nightmares, so I fall asleep holdin' a weapon
Some people do this for attention
You can miss me with the bullshit, I gets busy with this music
Tell 'em, "Shut up," or "Get butt-fucked with a broomstick"
Been tourin' since before you were born, and I made the rules, bitch
Thou shalt not hold thy tongue
Don't quit, no goin' home until you done
Like train tracks or breakin' glass, you can hear me comin'
Motherfuckers better take off runnin'

[Chorus]
Yeah
Danger, danger, this another banger
Feelin' like they know me, little homie, I'm a stranger
Moved out to the boonies, now I never deal with neighbors
No breaks, Speed Racer
I'm a Speed Racer (Pick up the pipe! Pick up the pipe!)
I'm a Speed Racer (Pick up the pipe! Pick up the pipe!)

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Well, it's a speed racer, cross-over knee breaker
Green maker, creator, hotter than the lines on the equator
Take your life and remake ya, all for the green paper
Write it all down but never got the time for eraser
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' song though
Drummin' on some big ol' titties, I'm playin' bongos
I put my long pole in the wrong hole
She say, "Get up out my stomach," I'm like, "Bitch, you know you love it"
I'm disgustin', mind start to wonder about this world we in
Then it's back on the phone, I'm fightin' with my girl again
Shit... I never been normal, as a youngin'
I was in black clothes, they close the portal on me
Talkin' shit but you foldin' more than origami
I'm fuckin' awesome, better run along and call your mommy
'Cause we droppin' bombs more than atom do
Still we posted up on Penn Avenue

[Chorus]
Yeah
Danger, danger, this another banger
Feelin' like they know me, little homie, I'm a stranger
Moved out to the boonies, now I never deal with neighbors
No breaks, Speed Racer
I'm a Speed Racer (Pick up the pipe! Pick up the pipe!)
I'm a Speed Racer (Pick up the pipe! Pick up the pipe!)

[Verse 1]
Alone, I'm searching for devotion
In a faded melody
My soul is trying to cross an ocean
Down on bended knee
Lock up my cadence and rhyme
Don't know what I'm trying to say
My heart, all the time was stolen by bad poetry

[Chorus]
Some nights I talk to myself
I say the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep
I say the words I never said when you were with me
Some nights I talk to myself
I say the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep
I say the words I never said when you were with me

[Verse 2]
I'm gone, the nightmares cut me open
Love's insanity
So long, words are left unspoken
I couldn't set them free
Watch all the language run dry, thoughts go on holiday
My heart, I'm left with a broken vocabulary

[Bridge]
Some nights I talk to myself
I say the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep
I say the words I never said when you were with me

[Chorus]
Some nights I talk to myself
I say the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep
I say the words I never said when you were with me
Some nights I talk to myself
I say the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep
I say the words I never said when you were with me

[Verse 1]
When you feel me up against your bones
Now don't you tell me to leave you alone
Now don't you tell me, now don't you tell me
I wear the crown coz I'm the one
To be anointed by you touch
Oh how you heal me, oh how you heal me

[Chorus]
I want you to touch me (use me like you gonna do), touch me (do me like you're gonna do), touch me (touch me like you wanna do)
I want you to touch me (use me like you gonna do), touch me (do me like you're gonna do), touch me (touch me like you wanna do)

[Verse 2]
Said you want it, baby (said you want it, baby)
What you gonna do
How you gonna please me
What you gonna do (what you gonna do)
I just want, I want you to
Said you want it, baby
I'm starving here for you, what you gonna feed me
What you wanna do, I want you, I want you

[Verse 1]
When you feel me up against your bones
Now don't you tell me to leave you alone
Now don't you tell me, now don't you tell me
I wear the crown coz I'm the one
To be anointed by you touch
Oh how you heal me, oh how you heal me

[Chorus]
I want you to touch me (use me like you gonna do), touch me (do me like you're gonna do), touch me (touch me like you wanna do)
I want you to touch me (use me like you gonna do), touch me (do me like you're gonna do), touch me (touch me like you wanna do)

[Outro]
I want you to touch me (use me like you gonna do)
I want you to touch me
I want you to touch me
I want you to touch me
I want you, I want you to touch me
Touch me
I want you to touch me
Touch me

[Verse 1]
Ten more days under water
And I already know
I’ll be fine
Ten more days till it’s over
Till the darkness goes
And I see the light

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m torn between fulfilling my wildest dreams
To satisfy the beast inside of me
And a grounded love that raises me high above
The grabbing hands of cowards and of thieves

[Chorus]
Ten more days to find my way
Ten more days till I’m awake
Ten more days till I don’t have to fight
I don’t need a future king
There ain’t a prayer that I could sing
Ten more days and I’m gonna make it right

[Verse 2]
You see my conscience betrayed me
But baby I’m strong enough
To take the tides
The bed, it trembles beneath me
But wherever the road is rough
You know I’ll rise

[Pre-Chorus]
I’m torn between fulfilling my wildest dreams
To satisfy the beast inside of me
And a grounded love that raises me high above
The grabbing hands of cowards and of thieves

[Chorus]
Ten more days to find my way
Ten more days till I’m awake
Ten more days till I don’t have to fight
I don’t need a future king
There ain’t a prayer that I could sing
Ten more days and I’m gonna make it right

[Verse 1: Avicii]
I wasn't always the brightest
Until I learned how to dance
You got me thinking
Love will come around but you
Never gave me a chance
I might not been the tallest
Until I learned how to jump
You got me thinking
Love will come around but you
Never say I'm the one

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
If I could make you, make you fall in love with me
If I could make you, make you fall in love
Wish I could make you, make you fall in love
Maybe love will come around, if you want it enough
Maybe love will come around, if you want it enough

[Post-Chorus]
Love will come around
Maybe love will come around for us

[Verse 2: Avicii]
I wasn't always the bravest
They say you only live once
So you got me thinking
I'm so glad I found ya
Life's what you make it, so here it comes

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
If I could make you, make you fall in love with me
If I could make you, make you fall in love
Wish I could make you, make you fall in love
Maybe love will come around, if you want it enough
Maybe love will come around, if you want it enough

[Outro: Avicii]
If you're a true believer
If you're a true believer
Love will come around, love will come around for us

[Verse 1]
City lights, take me away
Now it's time, we never ever head down
Don't be scared, I am for real
Hide away and we will never be found

[Pre-Chorus]
It's alright, we never look back
Birds will sing if we fall
It's alright, with memories inside
Midnight dust on the floor
Watch it turn into gold

[Chorus]
And I don't even know what's real
And I don't know what to feel
I'm your truth in disguise, I'm in love with your lies
'Cause I can't breathe, can't settle down
And I don't know what to feel
No, I don't know what to feel

[Verse 2]
See these lights, we're getting away
Heads won't find us, we're not making a sound
We're not scared, we are for real
Love can't hurt us, now we're sheltered by lies

[Pre-Chorus]
It's alright, we never look back
Birds will sing if we fall
It's alright, with memories inside
Midnight dust on the floor
Watch it turn into gold

[Chorus]
And I don't even know what's real
And I don't know what to feel
I'm your truth in disguise, I'm in love with your lies
'Cause I can't breathe, can't settle down
And I don't know what to feel
No, I don't know what to feel

[Verse 1: Sandro Cavazza]
Try'na set myself up for the win
Some people got a dream that's so much bigger than the town they're in
So give me love, give me love, give me peace, give me peace of mind
I know that there's an ought to a start and I need a little help with mine

[Pre-Chorus: Sandro Cavazza]
California, don't let me down
Seems so golden, but there's struggle all around
Sunset Jesus, came to me
He once was a waiter, now he's a savior making money on the street

[Chorus: Sandro Cavazza]
My dreams are made of gold
My heart's been broken and I'm down along the road
But I know, my dreams keep fading till I get old
Breathe for a minute, breathe for a minute, I'll be okay

[Verse 2: Sandro Cavazza]
Staring at the billboard from the bus
Looking at the faces, thinking that could be anyone of us
So give me hope, give me hope, give me hope on this lonely ride
Cause I know one day, I will be the one in the sky

[Pre-Chorus: Sandro Cavazza]
California, don't let me down
Seems so golden, but there's struggle all around
Sunset Jesus, came to me
He once was a waiter, now he's a savior making money on the street

[Bridge: Sandro Cavazza]
My dreams are made of gold
My heart's been broken and I'm down along the road
But I know, my dreams keep fading till I get old
Breathe for a minute, breathe for a minute
Sunset Jesus

[Outro: Sandro Cavazza]
My dreams are made of gold
My heart's been broken and I'm down along the road
But I know, my dreams keep fading till I get old
Breathe for a minute, breathe for a minute, I'll be okay
My dreams are made of gold
My heart's been broken and I'm down along the road
But I know, my dreams keep fading till I get old
Breathe for a minute, breathe for a minute, I'll be okay

[Verse 1]
That's me right there on the corner
Listening to Wu in my Walkman
Neon lights at the water, reflecting the city I'm lost in
That's me right there on the corner
I, one day, would be leaving
For a dream that I didn't have
That I'd one day would believe in
Strange how the same place I ran from
Is the same place I think of whenever the chance comes
It's inevitable, 'cause wherever I go

[Chorus]
I hear echoes of a thousand screams
As I lay me down to sleep
There's a black hole deep inside of me
Reminding me, that I've lost my backbone (Back home)
Somewhere in Stockholm
I lost my backbone (Back home), somewhere in Stockholm

[Verse 2]
I'm from a place where we never openly show our emotions
We drown our sorrows in bottomless bottles
And leave them to float in the ocean
I'm from a place where we never
Separate people from people
Some generalise, but in general I
Still believe that we are treated as equals
My father, my mother, my sister, my brother
My friends and my family's there
My hope and my money, my innocence in a sense
Almost lost everything here
Right where I was founded
Is right where I'll be found dead
The streets of my backbone, until I get back home

[Chorus]
I hear echoes of a thousand screams
As I lay me down to sleep
There's a black hole deep inside of me
Reminding me, that I've lost my backbone (Back home)
Somewhere in Stockholm
I lost my backbone (Back home), somewhere in Stockholm

[Bridge]
I'm not alone, I am the fire that burns
Not of the city but out of the 'burbs
A river that's just dying of thirst
I am a reverend lying in church
A crack in the pattern, a miracle waiting to happen
A promise that never was kept
One of those moments you'll never forget
I am that feeling inside
The one we all know but can't really describe
I am the blood spill, but I'm in love still
Somewhere in Stockholm
But I'm not alone
Don't have to get by on my own
I'm finally home
Hemma i Stockholm
Där jag hör hemma

[Chorus]
I hear echoes of a thousand screams
As I lay me down to sleep
There's a black hole deep inside of me
Reminding me, that I've lost my backbone (Back home)
Somewhere in Stockholm
I lost my backbone (Back home), somewhere in Stockholm

[Verse 1]
I've been a beggar and I've been a king
I've been a loner and I've worn the ring
Losing myself just to find me again
I'm a million miles smarter, but I ain't learned a thing
I've been a teacher and a student of hurt
I've kept my word for whatever that's worth
Never been last, but I've never been first
Oh I may not be the best, but I'm far from the worst
Oh I may not be the best, but I'm far from the worst

[Chorus]
Oh I've seen trouble more than any man should bear
But I've seen enough joy, I've had more than my share
And I'm still not done, I'm only halfway there
I'm a million miles ahead of where I'm from
But there's still another million miles to come

[Verse 2]
I keep on searching for the city of gold
And I'm gonna follow this yellow brick road
Thinking that maybe, it might lead me home
I'm a million miles farther and a long way from home
I know that there's a plan that goes way beyond mine
Got to step back just to see the design
The mind fears the heart, but the heart doesn't mind
Oh I may not be perfect, but I'm loving this life
Oh I may not be perfect, but I'm loving this life

[Chorus]
Oh I've seen trouble more than any man should bear
But I've seen enough joy, I've had more than my share
And I'm still not done, I'm only halfway there
I'm a million miles ahead of where I'm from
But there's still another million miles to come

[Instrumental Outro]

[Chorus]
I'm gonna love ya, like no one could
Make your heart feel the way it should
I'm gonna hold ya, when no one would
Cause I swear you deserve so good

[Verse 1]
Livin' up in California
Lovin' life but I've been waiting for ya
Turn my dreams and twist my fate
But God I hope it's not too late

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
I'm gonna love ya, I know I could

[Chorus]
I'm gonna love ya, like no one could
Make your heart feel the way it should
I'm gonna hold ya, when no one would
Cause I swear you deserve so good

[Verse 2]
Sometimes it's hard to have the upper hand
When every dream you've had is turning into sand
You need someone to make your day
But he took your breath and blew it away

[Chorus]
I'm gonna love ya, like no one could
Make your heart feel the way it should
I'm gonna hold ya, when no one would
Cause I swear you deserve so good

[Bridge]
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
I'm gonna love ya, I know I could
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
I'm gonna love ya, I know I could

I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
I'm gonna love ya, I know I could
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
I'm gonna love ya, I know I could

[Outro]
I'm gonna love ya like he never could
Cause I know you deserve so good
With you I stand, but for how long?
For how long?
But for how long...
With you my colors raged, but for how long?
For how long?
For how long...
With you, I am harbor
With you there was no distance
For how long?
But for how long...
With you we drew no lines
With you there was no divide
But for how long?
For how long?

[Chorus]
Cause I wouldn't watch you go and leave all that we know
But love's so hard to hold...
Cause I wouldn't watch you go and leave all that we know
But love's so hard to hold...
With you I rest, but for how long?
For how long?
For how long...
With you I've loved, but how love goes?
How love goes?
How it goes...
With you I built a tower
With you it stretched to the sun
But how it crumbles?
How it's gone...
With you my voice would carry and drift on through the air
But how it falters, when you're not there...

[Chorus]

You held me close
As I fell through your arms
And you held me close
(Fell through your arms, fell through your arms...)
As I fell through your arms
(Fell through your arms, fell through your arms...)
And you held me close
(Fell through your arms, fell through your arms...)
As I fell through your arms
(Fell through your arms, I fell through your arms--)

[Chorus]

[Verse 1: Father John Misty]
I'm gonna steal some bedsheets
From an amputee
I'm gonna mount 'em on a canvas
In the middle of the gallery
I'm gonna tell everybody
It was painted by a chimpanzee
But just between you and me
Here at the cultural low watermark
If it's fraud or art
They'll pay you to believe

[Verse 2: Father John Misty]
I'm gonna take five young dudes
From white families
I'm gonna mount 'em on a billboard
In the middle of the country
I'm gonna tell everybody
They sing like angels with whiter teeth
But just between you and me
They're just like the ones before
With their standards lower
Another concert-goer will pay you to believe

[Chorus: Father John Misty]
Oh, caffeine in the morning, alcohol at night
Cameras to record you and mirrors to recognize
And as the world is getting smaller, small things take up all your time
Narcissus would have had a field day if he could have got online
And friends, it's not self-love that kills you
It's when those who hate you are allowed
To sell you that you're a glorious shit
The entire world revolves around
And that you're the eater, no not the eaten
But that your hunger will only cease
If you come binge on a radiant blandness
At the disposable feast

[Bridge: Father John Misty & Voiceover]
You're enjoying the chill winter playlist
Just quickly how would you rate yourself
Indie Brunch
In terms of sex appeal and cultural significance?
Irony, irony, blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blo
Do you usually listen to music like this?
Just one more mile, you can do it again
Can we recommend some similar artists?
This is totally the song of my summer
Are you feeling depressed?
This guy just gets me
But your feedback's important to us
Music is my life

[Verse 3]
Gonna buy myself a sports team
And put 'em in a pit
I'm gonna wage the old crusade
Against consciousness
All I need's a couple winners
To get every loser to fight in it
Keep the golden calf
Just need the bullshit
And they won't just sell themselves into slavery
They'll get on their knees and pay you to believe

[Intro]
If only you guys knew what just happened in here
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Can you turn the beat up a little bit, yeah
Turn my headphones up
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Well who is he? I be ze meanest, putting Jesus pieces on a fetus
The Lord taketh, then he keepeth one of many masterpieces
I'm rolling up the weed and feasting on gravidas
Your bitch a junkie, always sucking on somebody's penis
Ooh, I'm eating General Tso's chicken off the fine china
I put my dick inside your bitch and say the "Our Father"
Young Moses part water
Head wraps car bomber
Death trap dark slider
Jump on motherfucker, got ya, once I dropped ya
Who's hot? I moonwalk the jungle gym
Do not try to stop cause you not gon' fuck with him
I'm rumbling with countrymen, do it for the USA
First you get the money, then the fame, then you get paid
Ali Bomaye, come with superhuman strength
All this for the music's sake, but I'm getting stupid paid
Get ahead or lose a leg
Never did the funeral fake
To be great you await
Everybody let's eat cake
D-dumbass

[Interlude]
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't stop

[Verse 2]
I'm sipping liquor 'til my liver pop
And playing tennis with cinder blocks, I'm in the spot
Chilling with some nympho THOTs, landed on the Planet Rock
Man of God, hammerhead shark in human camoflauge
Duck down I'm on, understand the planet's strong
Lead singer came with Keith Richards, brought the band along
I'm pretty Zen lady, headspin is 1080
They say that I went crazy but love me when the check cleared
Red beard, seen into the future, fear the end near
Bitch I want it all, I will not give you not a cent here
This is not pretend, I'm trying to pay some pricy rent here
It's no words, selling Goldberg and you gon' get speared
Do the most, I'm the host and the special guest here
It's a fucking party started, everybody get weird
Take your pants off, move your body, you can dance around
I got you shitting in your pants, you wearing Pampers now
Mean flow, hitting free throws, shoot 'em granny style
Came a long way from rocking hand-me-downs, fr-fr-fresh
I said the world is just a big gazebo, so baby let's get married in it

[Interlude]
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't stop

[Verse 3]
Morning Mr. McCormick, Mr. Should've-Been-Aborted
Mr. Mighty-Morphin'-Sperm, the Michael Jordan's Nike fortune
Money make me feel important like some type of vital organ
Rich people give poor advice, never could afford it
Walk into the jewelry store
Spend all my money, fuck did I do this for?
Pussy on my mustache
Never clean it up cause I'm a dumbass

[Outro]
Baby, I want your love
Baby, I need your love
Baby, I want your love

From the first moment, I knew
I really want to know you
I ain't never met nobody like you
You make me want to show you, the world
I used to feel alone, I used to feel alone
'Til I got you
I used to feel alone, I used to feel alone
'Til I got you
My love, my, my love, my love, my
I wouldn't be alone, 'cause
I got a girl who's down to ride with me
Damn, she looks good on that passenger side with me
No more time to waste, thinking 'bout the past
Adjust that rear view got my foot on the gas, yeah
I got a girl who's down to ride with me

From the first moment I knew
I wanted this forever and ever, baby
Baby, I'mma always be around
'Cause we're in this together, yeah
So when you feel alone, when you feel alone
Baby, just know I got you
When you feel alone, when you feelin' lost
Baby, just know I got you
My love, my love
My love, my love
I wouldn't be alone, 'cause
I got a girl who's down to ride with me
Damn, she looks good on that passenger side with me
No more time to waste, thinking 'bout the past
Adjust that rear view got my foot on the gas, yeah
I got a girl who's down to ride with me
Thank God
I got a girl who's down to ride with me

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
I too would have envied
If I lived above the water
I don't blame the sky for
Being so blue!
If you don't believe me
Just go and ask the humans
When they're down there swimming
With everything to do!

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams (Shay Haley)]
Look at who the smart guy is now (And what are you?)
Spongebob, and it's not you!
Look at who the smart guy is now (And what are you?)
And Sandy Squirrel, it's not you!
Look at the smart guy is now (And what are you?)
Hey booga-boo-hoo!
Look at who the smart guy is now (And what are you?)
Krabby Patties will be cooked by who?

[Chorus]
And it goes eata-eata-edeo
It's creeping in your head and so
It's brainwashing the radio
That Patrick Star is king
Eata-eata-edeo
That rhymes with Spaghetti-O's
He's the king of
Bi-ki-ni Bottom

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
I too would have envied
If I lived above the water
I guess that is why they-
Why they pollute!
To me that's a silly
Stupid concept when they
Wanna get away-
They wanna take a cruise!

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams (Shay Haley)]
Look at who the smart guy is now (And what are you?)
Spongebob, and it's not you!
Look at who the smart guy is now (And what are you?)
And Sandy Squirrel, it's not you!
Look at the smart guy is now (And what are you?)
Hey booga-boo-hoo!
Look at who the smart guy is now (And what are you?)
Krabby Patties will be cooked by who?

[Chorus]
And it goes eata-eata-edeo
It's creeping in your head and so
It's brainwashing the radio
That Patrick Star is king
Eata-eata-edeo
That rhymes with Spaghetti-O's
He's the king of
Bi-ki-ni Bottom

[Verse 1]
We sat on a roof, named every star
Shared every bruise and showed every scar
Hope has its proof put your hand in mine
"Life has a beautiful, crazy design"

[Chorus]
And time seemed to say
"Forget the world and its weight"
And here I just wanna stay
Amazing day, amazing day

[Verse 2]
We sat on a roof, named every star
You showed me a place where you can be who you are

[Chorus]
And the view; the whole Milky Way
In your eyes, I drifted away
And in your arms, I just wanna sway
Amazing day, amazing day
Amazing day, amazing day
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oooh

[Bridge]
And I asked
Can the birds in poetry chime?
"Can there be breaks in the chaos sometimes?"
Oh thanks God, must’ve heard when I prayed
Cause now I always want to feel this way

[Outro]
Amazing day, amazing day
Amazing day, amazing day
Yeah, today

[Verse 1]
Here's a toast to you its been too long
And we're drinking 'til the night is gone
Where did you go, and have you seen?
And over there, does the air taste differently?

[Chorus]
Where did you go? Where did you go?
I don't know
Where did you go? Where did you go?
I don't know, I don't know

[Verse 2]
But I know you're watching over me
You help us through the good and through the pain we breathe
One day we'll wake up from this crazy dream
We'll meet again after my lights dim out
And I'll be wondering

[Chorus]
Where will we go? Where will we go?
I don't know
Where will we go? Where will we go?
I don't know, I don't know

[Guitar Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Where will we go? Where will we go?
I don't know
Where will we go? Where will we go?
I don't know, I don't know

[Verse 1]
Under the great North Star
Try to work out where you are
In the silence of the sea
I don't know where I'll be

In the future, in the past
Going nowhere, much too fast
When I go there, go with me
When I go there, go with me

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't know where I'm going and I wanna talk
I feel like I'm going where I've been before
And I wanna talk

[Verse 2]
Take a picture of
Something that you're not sure of
Bring it back to show to me
But I don't know what I see
In the future, find a home
Getting nowhere on your own
Got to find your missing piece

[Chorus]
'Cause you don't know where you're going and you wanna talk
You feel like you're going where you've been before
Nothing's really making any sense at all
You tell anyone who'll listen but you feel ignored
Let's talk, let's talk
Do you wanna talk?

[Bridge]
I'm up in the part of the throne
I'm trying to sing a song
In a language I don't speak

I tried but I can't get through
I'm trying to get to you
But you're difficult to reach
Won't you talk to me?

[Chorus]
So you don't know where you're going and you wanna talk
You feel like you're going where you've been before
Let's talk, let's talk
Let's talk, let's talk

[Verse 1]
I know what I want
And I want it right now, right now
I know what I need
And I need right now, right now
'Cause you're looking at me
Like you're thinking it, too
I don't see nobody here
But us two

[Chorus]
We can stir it all night
Girl, your body so tight
We can stir it all night
You can throw it back now
Don't hold nothing back now
We can stir it all night
Girl, your body so tight
We can stir it all night
You can follow back now
Don't hold nothing back now
I'm making you hot
I'mma give it to you right now, right now
I know what you got
And I want it right now, right now
Ooh, let me put it on you
'Cause I know I could do
I don't see nobody here
But us two

[Chorus]
We can stir it all night
Girl, your body so tight
We can stir it all night
You can throw it back now
Don't hold nothing back now
We can stir it all night
Girl, your body so tight
We can stir it all night
You can follow back now
Don't hold nothing back now

[Bridge]
Oh, let me hear you say, oh-oh
Oh, let me hear you say, oh-oh
Hey, give it to me now
And let me put it on you
Yes, I know what to do
Ain't nobody here
But us two

[Chorus]
We can stir it all night
Girl, your body so tight
We can stir it all night
You can throw it back now
Don't hold nothing back now
We can stir it all night
Girl, your body so tight
We can stir it all night
You can follow back now
Don't hold nothing back now

[Intro]
Yeah, can you feel it?
Yeah

[Verse 1]
It take a little bit of practice (Practice)
Get lost in the madness, world keep spinnin' on the axis (Woah)
Risen from the ashes (Ashes)
Overthrew the king, now I'm feelin' high, shittin' on the palace (Woo)
Wishin' on a miracle, livin' on a prayer (Prayer)
Open up ya third eye, see what's really there (Really there)
Wait, you can taste the freedom in the air
Give thanks, based beings, we the rarest (We the rarest)
Yeah, you starin' at an illusion (Yep)
I don't need shit, I'm my own Rick Rubin (Woah)
Burnin' down ya city, have a concert on the ruins (Okay)
Go home, release all the little homies who in Shuman (Let's go)
I'm goonin', this music comin' out the coop kachooin' (Yep)
Super loose, start to hula hoop with Paul Newman (A-ha)
Say, "Fuck it," and keep it movin' (Yep)
Can't stop the revolution (This a movement)
We either choose or get chosen, confusion, commotion
Turn out the lights and the pools turn to oceans (Woah)
Yeah, this the end of the world as we know it

[Chorus]
Said, there ain't no heaven for somebody like me
Let it all burn in the blunt of my weed
Wonder what it must be like when it all seem right (Woo)
Said, does it feel good? (Yeah)
Afraid you might fall when you're up this high (High, high, high)

[Verse 2]
Uh, said
Take you to maximum velocity (Velocity)
Have to wait for man to recognize God in me (Woo)
I offer no apologies, honestly (Honestly)
I'm 'bout to start smackin' motherfuckers in the face just for comedy (Woah)
As my sanity slip, 'cause there ain't much danger, it's as vanity is (Uh-huh)
Somebody asked me what my fantasy is
I smiled and told 'em, "Hand me a bitch" (Let's go)
Lord, can it be this? And if it isn't, can you grant me a wish?
If I never see heaven, let me sample its bliss
I get high to get by 'cause inside of my mind is a mess
All the stress that I find is a blessin' in disguise
'Cause we fall, then we rise, to learn it's my turn
Let me go, it's my time, let 'em know that I'm on now (On now)
Pittsburgh, we on now (Woo), woah

[Chorus]
Said, there ain't no heaven for somebody like me
Let it all burn in the blunt of my weed
Wonder what it must be like when it all seem right
Said, does it feel good?
Afraid you might fall when you're up this high (High, high, high)

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Said, there ain't no heaven for somebody like me
Let it all burn in the blunt of my weed
Wonder what it must be like when it all seem right
Said, does it feel good?
Afraid you might fall when you're up this high (High, high, high)

[Intro]
The birds are chirping!
Uh-ah! Uh-ah! I need a bird!
Uh-ah! Uh-ah! I-I need a bird! Ah!
Robert Dinero, boom, ugh!

[Pre-Hook]
Robert Dinero, I get the money (I get the money)

Stacking the twenties, the fifties, the hundreds, I get the money
I get the money, you see how it's coming, I get the money

[Verse 1: Mystikal]
Fucking writing raps tighter than grip pliers, I spit for higher
Pesos, pesos, Cinco de Mayo, Robert Dinero
Or fuckin' Richard Pryor, I'm on fire!
Your paper on a diet, liar
My pocket on Camilla, partner
I get that Draymond, I get that green nigga
I get that Andre Iguo-dollar, dollar
Teflon dollar, nickels, pennies, never, nada
Original mothafuckin' don dada
Don't snort powder, do blow ganja
I get the fifties, the multi, the millions and hundreds, the thousands
Might hurt your feelings when I hit the building, bitch I be clowning
Clown wit' it! Cold as fuck, I'm raw and uncut, I'm dope like a kilo
What do you know? Soon as I said dope, this mothafucka talkin' bout he need a kilo
I got the bestest and baddest of bitches, the sexiest fuck me
I be like andale, andale, andale, andale, bitch get from under me!

[Pre-Hook + Hook]

[Verse 2: Mystikal]
Suck my dick, bitch I'm rich and I'mma flaunt it!
If I pull up in it, then I own it
I kill these niggas deader than a weekend at Bernie's
They come with that garbage, Fred Sanford
I got that E-40 - "yup, nope"
Birds comin' faster than a nigga colon arrow in a toilet
I be callin' Remy darling, Wanda Sykes, Raven-Symoné-moné
Big Truck Records is a muthafuckin' one man army, Sylvester Stallone
Bitch I got them knuckles, bitch I got them elbows
Bitch I got them Jonny "Bones" John-John
You can call me Mystikal and you can call me Michael
Bitch, just don't call me on my phone
I got them cars and them houses, got that Benzino, I got that Larry Holmes-Holmes
I got that rabbit, got that log cabin, bitch I got syrup
I got that lethal, I got that purple, got that Danny Glover, Whoopi Goldberg
No Danny Devito on my Robert Deniro
You gon' fuck around and get the business bitch, Geraldo Rivera, shit!

(Warren G)
Steppin on the M-I-C {n.e.s.t.d.o.g.p.o.u.n.d?}

Crushing silly fuckers on top of a pile
Clocking a grip, dissing a bitch

Don't trip
G Dub my name and my frame
Ya see in long beach ain't nobody in the same game
Thats why i gotta come at you like this
So if ya step, ya diss, ya snitch
It's all your fault and ya did it on your own
Since i'm a dog i guess the mic is my bone

So ride the mic as if ya name was rover
So take the mic cause i'm finna raise up
Remember loc's down and dogs up

(Snoop Dogg)

Into the p and imma thriller
And when i step to the mic
Best believe im gonna ?

Listen to the lyrics and ya feel its time
For snoop to get started
I need just to bust with one
Cause am full of fun
Am on 2-1 street
Cause thats where i chill at and live
So watch me grab the microphone
And come negative
No need to come popping?
Cause that ain't the life i live
I grab the mic and i begin to lay a
A rhyme i wrote i quote is dope
A scrub i scope am a dogg i could never be a loc
Now watch me flow into another rhyme
And as you listen to the lyrics you will say its about time
For snoop the dogg to do his thing
And put ya'll all in the insane type of thing
Thats what am talking about without a doubt
Ya scream and dream and fiend ya know what I mean
I comes correct on every tape i'm on
My word is born you love to listen to my songs
Me and my homie G Dub
While i rock the mic
He grabs the tables and scrubs
Then the when the ladies love it
Because when we make a tape
Ya suckers be begging and bugging
Love it, dub it, that's what they wanna do
So let me take the microphone and begin to do a funky style of rhyme with combination
I'm coming correct with another illustration
But as i flow into another mind? you listen
Don't interrupt cause my comprehension
Level gets deeper by the second
This a funky fresh song in other words a record
That's coming through your ears

[Verse 1]
I done kept it real from the jump
Living at my momma's house we'd argue every month
Nigga, I was tryna get it on my own
Working all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle calling me like, "Where ya at?
I gave you the keys, told ya bring it right back”
Nigga, I just think it's funny how it goes

[Verse 2]
Boys tell stories 'bout the man
Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah, I doubt it
Nigga, I could turn your boy into the man
There ain't really much out here, that's popping off without us
Nigga, we just want the credit where it's due
I'mma worry 'bout me, give a fuck about you
Nigga, just as a reminder to myself
I wear every single chain, even when I'm in the house cause we...

[Hook:]
Word on the street, I'm the best thing going
Smoking on the gas, got the best thing blowing
Tattoo's on my face, It's my face not yours
Spanish broads, Gucci clothes
Nigga everything foreign
Pop a pill, popped a seal
Then I start back pouring
Yellow horses on my cars, like they rocking Ralph Lauren
Bought an old school yesterday just to paint the bitch orange
So much money in my pocket I could paint a bitch orange

[Verse 1:]
I'm in hot pursuit, I'm stacking loot
You niggas sweet as apple juice
Your girlfriend got an apple-bottom, suck dick like she Snaggle-tooth
She walk round with an attitude, I show that bitch no gratitude
I’m a tycoon, I can change her longitude and latitude
Slap niggas with pistols til' they only can eat baby food
Colder than a refrigerator, hotter than a stolen coupe
I woke up in the morning, rolled a blunt and than I cooked this deuce
I cracked the seal, poured up a 4, than put it in a Mountain Dew

[Hook:]
Word on the street, I'm the best thing going
Smoking on the gas, got the best thing blowing
Tattoo's on my face, It's my face not yours
Spanish broads, Gucci clothes
Nigga everything foreign
Pop a pill, popped a seal
Then I start back pouring
Yellow horses on my cars, like they rocking Ralph Lauren
Bought an old school yesterday just to paint the bitch orange
So much money in my pocket I could paint a bitch orange

[Verse 2:]
They be stupid, dumb, bad with that crazy Gucci bag
Her man buy her a Jag, how you gon' compete with that
Wanna take her on a date, than you must fuck up a set
She so spoiled, if he gave her to you would give her back
You can love me all you want but i'ma lock you from a distance
Begging me to pay you, I'ma pay you no attention
Fresher than my pad, baby girl you got me twisted
I heard you got a boyfriend, don't your man play for the Pistons?
I had a girl named Susie and she used to go the distance
She sucked dick like a porno flick, I gave that bitch the business
She asked me for a gift , I told her today must be Christmas
Just like the Sprite and Promethazine, bitch you got me mixed up

[Hook:]
Word on the street, I'm the best thing going
Smoking on the gas, got the best thing blowing
Tattoo's on my face, It's my face not yours
Spanish broads, Gucci clothes
Nigga everything foreign
Pop a pill, popped a seal
Then I start back pouring
Yellow horses on my cars, like they rocking Ralph Lauren
Bought an old school yesterday just to paint the bitch orange
So much money in my pocket I could paint a bitch orange

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Well, who is he?
I be the meanest, putting Jesus' pieces on a fetus
The Lord taketh and he keepeth, one of many masterpieces
I'm, rolling up the weed, and feasting on gorditas
Your bitch a junkie, always sucking on somebodies penis
Ooo, I'm eatin' generals, so it's chicken off the fine china
I put my dick inside your bitch and say the our father
Young Moses, part Wahlberg
Head Wrapped, car bomber
Death trap, dark slider
Jump, I motherfucking got ya, once I dropped ya
Who's hot?
I moonwalk the Jungle GYM
Do not try to stop, cause you not gon' fuck with him
I'm rumblin' with countrymen
Do it for the USA
First you get the money, then the fame, then you get paid
Allayboomyay!
Come with superhuman strength
All this for the music's sake
But I'm getting stupid paid
Get ahead or lose a leg
Never did the funeral fake
To be great, you await
Everybody lets eat cake!

[Hook: Big Boi]
And ya don't and ya don't and ya don't stop

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Uh, I'm sipping liquor 'til my liver pop
And playing tennis with cinder blocks
I'm in the spot
Chillin' with some nympho thots
Landed on the Planet Rock
Man to God, Hammerhead Shark in human camouflage
God damn, I'm on
Understand the plan is strong
Lead singer, came with Keith Richards, brought the band along
I'm pretty zen, lady
Head spinning, it's 1080
They say that I went crazy, but love me when the check clear
Red beard
See into the future, fear the end near
Bitch, I want it all, I will not give you not a cent here
This is not pretend, I'm trynna pay some pricey rent here
It's no words
Send in Goldberg and you gon' get speared
Do the most, I'm the host, and the special guest here
It's a fucking party started, everybody get weird
Take your pants off, move your body, you can dance around
I got you shitting in your pants, you wearing pampers now
Mean flow, hittin' free throws
Shoot em' granny style
Came a long way from rocking hand-me-downs
Err-Err, Fresh
I said the world is just a big gazebo
So, baby, let's get married in it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
Well, mornin' Mr. McCormick
Mister should have been aborted
Mister Mighty Morphing sperm
Might absorb this Nike fortune
Money makes me feel important, like some type of vital organ
Rich people give poor advice, never could afford it
Walk into the jewelry store
Spendin' all my money
What did I do this for?
Pussy on my mustache
Never clean it up cause I'm a dumbass
Zaytoven!

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Pulled a bitch out the hat, yeah that's... magic
And I got a lotta bitches at my... mansion
Molly, stogies, gas, and some... matches
Got your wifey on my lap like Outkast, tragic
Magic
Magic, Alakazam
Magic
Magic, well I, Alakazam

[Verse: Post Malone]
32 ounces on me like I'm Magic, ahh
Magic Johnson 3, I ain't playin' basketball
And we got some molly, magic potion, alcohol
I'm with Aphrodite, drinkin' nectar of the gods
Wakin' up to some Swishers and some liquor (Swishers and liquor)
Fuck 'em or fuck her, whatever get me faded quicker
She grind on my zipper 'cause I'm a big tipper
She stay in L.A. like she play for the Clippers
You see what we whippin', whole crew is shittin' on mothafuckas
Can't stand the heat, then get the fuck out the kitchen
I got that Houdini, disappear her bikini
She rub on my lamp, damn I feel like a genie
On my magic carpet, I'm poppin' a wheelie
So fresh, you can't see me, I do this routinely
I don't do no freebies, you feel me?
I need me a couple bands
They appear in my fuckin' hands

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Pulled a bitch out the hat, yeah that's... magic
And I got a lotta bitches at my... mansion
Molly, stogies, gas, and some... matches
Got your wifey on my lap like Outkast, tragic

Bitches, bitches, bitches
You love Moet?
Bring some of that shit
Bring it to me!
Skeet, skeet, skeet, skeet, skeet, skeet, skeet
I love Moet
Everybody that's in this place love Moet!

[Verse 1: RBX]
Flossy bitches in leathers
Smellin' like Prada, shakin' their tailfeathers
I hit the event with the hydro glow
Never party pooper, super rhyme pro
I can feel hatred when I step through the door
Why you talkin' bout me?  You best watch your hoe
'Cause she is watchin' me, I'm watchin' her watch me
She clockin' the Versace, eyes locked to the watch-y!
I move to her pimpin', step it up a notch-y
The 'Zine play pimpin' like a 50-inch Hitachi
With a body like a bottle, is your name Jeannie?
You need to be with me, why you chillin' with that weenie?
Dude get mad like he gon' blow a fit
Nigga, don't you know the Glock ready to spit?
Lord have his mercy, get this, nitwit;
It's nasty in the cut and don't make the Glock spit!

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah! We just sippin' on some Moet
To get the hoes "mo' wet,"
You hoes better know it!

[Verse 2: Wayniac (Bishop Don Magic Juan)]
Let's get it poppin'; homie, put some Mo' in my cup
Man, the way this bass bangin', I'm buzzed, ready to fuck!
Tryin' to get my duck sucked, let her massage these nuts
Like the Bishop say, (STEP YOUR GAME UP!)
We dem niggas that they wanna hang with, do they thang with
Don't mind me, just vibe off this gangsta shit
Hootie-Hoo in the house gon' get some!
Feelin' good 'cause she wet but we tryin' to get her "mo' wet,"

[Verse 3: Trip Locc]
Pour it 'till it's all gone, you might get the suds
When you sip it, make sure you finish, then you get a buzz
We don't love nan' one of you's, hope you soak it up
Understand how we do it, cashin' in and gettin' sucked up
For real, we don't play, takin' breaks when we can
Hit the glow like the strobe, puttin' bitches in a jam
Scram!  We on to the next destination
Pimpin's how we do it, puttin bitches in their places!

[Bridge 1: Bishop Don Magic Juan]
It's up to you, playa
To make sure them bottles multiply but not out YOUR pocket!
Dig, it's the new Mack-illennium now
And chicks not gonna get away with that game no more!

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah! We just sippin' on some Moet
To get the hoes "mo' wet,"
You hoes better know it!
Yeah! We sippin' on some Moet
To get the hoes "mo' wet,"
You hoes better know it!

[Verse 4: E-White]
Drunk as fuck but still sippin', I'm stuck in this position
Where the rest of all my niggas I came up in here with?
Talk to the bitches like I won't, I'm tryin' to roll a blunt
Ain't got no time to sit and holla, come swallow me or somethin'
Since tomorrow wasn't promised, I'mma party 'til I die
Big glass of Moet, share with my niggas in the sky!
Tipsy on a fifth, I'm gettin' frisky with a bitch
Oh yeah, I used to hit her sister, but that was in '96!
Leave a tip with the bartender;
You little slender, fine ho, I'm comin' home wit'cha
Ya boy slizzard, they be touchin' on my dick, I'm rushin' to get a fix
Another shot'll set us off, it cost to get with this!
I'm just a hop and a skip around the way from where I say I'm from
My dick back in my pants and I'm finished for the day!
I ain't sayin' it no more, the glass get it poppin'
Ass is what I'm lookin' for, she got it, got it!

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah! We just sippin' on some Moet
To get the hoes "mo' wet,"
You hoes better know it!
Yeah! We sippin' on some Moet

[Bridge 2: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, we got 40 hoes in here so we gonna need about..
You know, lemme see how many bottles we gonna need
Lemme add this shit up real quick
Gimme one second, hold on, let me see...
OK, all right, here we go!

[Verse 5: Snoop Dogg]
Look, ten times five plus four minus three
Bitches'll bring bottles, and they all for free!
I go hard on 'em, guard on 'em, pourin' my glass
I want the little yellow bitch with the big ol' ass
My young homeboy shot some drag and he put out a bag
Now she drinkin' and she thinkin' that she gon' get some cash!
Look, fill it up one more 'gain, get that shit crack-a-lackin'
Tell her to back it up, suck a nigga like Dracula
And now she feelin' good, I'm feelin' good, it's so spectacular
This ain't no actin' here, but you'll be actin' up
Laughin' and crackin' up, talkin' to your peoples 'bout
How it rolls, you call it Mimosa, let's toast to
The hood life, the good life!
You could, might be livin' the good life if you do it right, do it right!

[Bridge 3: Bishop Don Magic Juan]
When you see a playa chargin' a chick
Dig, playa, pat him on the back
Don't playa-hate, congratulate!

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
Yeah! We just sippin' on some Moet
To get the hoes "mo' wet,"
You hoes better know it!
Yeah! We sippin' on some Moet
To get the hoes "mo' wet,"

[Chorus]
40 got me funky (Funky)
I popped a molly (Molly), went kamikaze
Another 40
I'm Michael Jordan and bitch, I'm scoring
Drank two 40's
My bitch is foreign, she got deported
Thousand ounces, police is knocking
Ain't got no worries (Ain't got no)
Feeling funky
I popped a molly, went kamikaze (Kami)
Another 40
I'm Kyrie Irving and bitch, I'm scoring
Drank two 40's
My bitch is foreign, she got deported
Thousand ounces, this shit still popping
Ain't got no worries

[Post-Chorus]
40 got me funky
40 got me funky
40 got me funky
40 got me funky
40 got me funky (Stoney)

[Verse 1]
I popped a molly, switching lanes
I'ma pull up in this bitch, exotic (Skrrt)
Lean in Sprite and gin in tonic
These bitches erotic
She just wanna get inside my motherfucking pocket (Yeah)
Another 40, I should stop it (Woah)
Two thousand ounces of this shit will make you feel like vomit
But I don't mind it, I kinda like it
Young and wild
We killing shit, we live this shit
I ain't go to school
They ask me how I live like this
I did my shit, 20 this year
And I'm only getting older 'til I'm in the dirt (I'm in the dirt)
How I hold a grudge with two 40's all in my hand (All in my hand)
But pull up on me, try me, you can catch the fade, my man
You and your friends

[Chorus]
40 got me funky (Funky)
I popped a molly (Molly), went kamikaze
Another 40
I'm Michael Jordan and bitch, I'm scoring
Drank two 40's
My bitch is foreign, she got deported
Thousand ounces, police is knocking
Ain't got no worries (Ain't got no)
Feeling funky
I popped a molly, went kamikaze (Kami)
Another 40
I'm Kyrie Irving and bitch, I'm scoring
Drank two 40's
My bitch is foreign, she got deported
Thousand ounces, this shit still popping
Ain't got no worries

[Post-Chorus]
40 got me funky
40 got me funky
40 got me funky
40 got me funky
40 got me funky

[Verse 2]
Gimme the 40
So I can be cool, yeah
Pass me the molly, ayy
I wanna them too
No, I can't get enough
Man, I'm popping them shits and I'm dropping them hits
The music, the liquor that’s why I exist
And the money, but let's skip the obvious shit
Ain't living too long if I'm living like this
Early morning waking up with the sweats
Going through shit I ain't never forget
But nothing I do, will I ever regret
I need me that cheque, I need me that chronic
I don't remember, tell me what's my name?
Drinking, swerving in the other lane
Fucking zooted drinking acid rains
Spill it on Supreme

[Chorus]
40 got me funky (Funky)
I popped a molly (Molly), went kamikaze
Another 40
I'm Michael Jordan and bitch, I'm scoring
Drank two 40's
My bitch is foreign, she got deported
Thousand ounces, police is knocking
Ain't got no worries (Ain't got no)
Feeling funky
I popped a molly, went kamikaze (Kami)
Another 40
I'm Kyrie Irving and bitch, I'm scoring
Drank two 40's
My bitch is foreign, she got deported
Thousand ounces, this shit still popping
Ain't got no worries

[Post-Chorus]
40 got me funky
40 got me funky
40 got me funky
40 got me funky
40 got me funky

[Verse 1]
You try to find her at the bottom of the bottle
But she's gone
Nothing you seem to do can heal the wounds
And start to right these wrongs

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The only one you love has changed their mind
And said they're moving on
Some nights you start to feel
You'll never get back all the love you lost

[Chorus]
These are the days you will remember
When you're standing at the very end
These are the days to make you stronger
If you ever have to fight again

[Verse 2]
Stand up and carry on
You know you'll never fall as hard again
Disturb the ashes of the one you lost
You know you did your best

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You'll find a new direction
From the serpent running in your head
The pain you said you'd feel forever
You will learn how to forget

[Chorus]
These are the days you will remember, you will remember
These are the days you will remember, you will remember
These are the days you will remember
When you're standing at the very end
These are the days to make you stronger
If you ever have to fight again

[Chorus]
These are the days you will remember
When you're standing at the very end
These are the days to make you stronger
If you ever have to fight again
These are the days you will remember, you will remember

[Verse 1]
With every passing moment
Thoughts of you run through my head
I am slowly realizing
I think you're truly heaven-sent

[Pre-Chorus]
I think you're truly something special
Something my dreams are really made of
Let's stay together, you and me, boy
There's no one like you around, oh

[Chorus]
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it, I'm so into you
Really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it, I'm so into you

[Verse 2]
Know the way you hold me
Might be the things that you say
I don't know what it is, boy
But I know I like feeling this way, oh, boy

[Pre-Chorus]
I think they're truly something special
Just what my dreams are really made of
Let's stay together, you and me, boy
There's no one like you around, ooh

[Chorus]
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it, I'm so into you
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it, oh, no
No, no, no, no, no, no

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it, I am so into you
Really like (I really like) done to me
Oh, I can't really explain it (I'm so into you)
Really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it, I'm so into you
Really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it, I'm so into you
So into you

Since I'm the best I walk with extra gestures
Lead on my hip for the textbook testers

Is it a kind of a dream?
Floating out on the tide
Following the river of death downstream
Oh, is it a dream?

There's a fog along the horizon
A strange glow in the sky
And nobody seems to know where it goes
And what does it mean?
Oh, is it a dream?

Bright eyes, burning like fire
Bright eyes, how can you close and fail?
How can the light that burned so brightly
Suddenly burn so pale?
Bright eyes

Is it a kind of a shadow?
Reaching into the night
Wandering over the hills unseen
Or, is it a dream?
There's a high wind in the trees
A cold sound in the air
And nobody ever knows when you go
And where do you start?
Oh, into the dark

Bright eyes, burning like fire
Bright eyes, how can you close and fail?
How can the light that burned so brightly
Suddenly burn so pale?
Bright eyes

Bright eyes, burning like fire
Bright eyes, how can you close and fail?
How can the light that burned so brightly
Suddenly burn so pale?
Bright eyes

[Verse 1]
Emotional slave slut
She push and pulls, uses me for what she needs
Just an emotional slave slut
Been tossed aside like rotten meat
While the maggots and vultures feast
Feasting on my memories
Everyone's searching for lightning
Hold up a box of recycling

[Chorus]
Bury me to sleep in a wedding tux
Everything, everyone sucks
Bury me to sleep in a wedding tux
Everything, everyone sucks

[Verse 2]
Just an emotional slave slut
She push and pulls, uses me for what she needs
Just an emotional slave slut
Been tossed aside like rotting meat
While the maggots and vultures feast
I can't wait to be rotting meat
Everyone searching for lightning
Right in plain sight, you deny him

[Chorus]
Bury me to sleep in a wedding tux
Everything, everyone sucks
Everything, everyone sucks
Bury me to sleep in a wedding tux
Everything, everyone sucks

Lets go

[Verse 1]
I've been dreaming lots these days
In a lot of crazy ways
Might be losing it for sure

Things get bland when she's not around
Feel like hiding underground
Everything around is hers

[Chorus]
One more stretch, everything will be just great
No more prince, now its off the winners race
I'm so bored, take me to another place
Just can't wait for the fights

[Verse 2]
Haters hating all the time
Doesn't matter, girl, you're mine
Twirl some green and move away
Haters hating what to do
Doesn't matter, I've got you
Twirl some green and move away

[Chorus]
One last stretch, everything will be just great
No more  prince, now its off the winners race
I'm so bored, take me to another place
Just can wait for the fights

[Intro]
This is central control
This is central control
Standby
In formation to follow
We are ready to transmit-
We are ready to transmit

[Verse 1]
Snow doesn't care, if there's snow in his hair
There's ice in his beard

He's just as old, as any I'd know
Just sounds so unclear

[Chrous]
He's my northern, man
With his northern, hands
He's my northern, man
With his northern, hands

[Verse 2]
Meat on his plate, held together in tape
He's dreaming all night

Killed it himself, a bear out of hell
It gave him a fight

[Chorus]
He's my northern, man
With his northern, hands
He's my northern, man
With his northern, hands
He's my guy
He's my guy

[Intro]
Hey baby, I lied about thinking about you; wondering where you are
You should come over, I have a surprise for you

[Verse 1]
Here I am roamin' out on the street
No-one's around to see
The dust and the salt have covered my feet
And then she came 'round to me
Her hair is so long and her eyes are so smooth
The words that she's speaks aren't true
My baby looks lonely but she's feeling good
She does what she wants to do

[Chorus]
She's so cool
She's a moon woman, she's in my heart
She's a cruel woman, at least so far
She's a moon woman, she's in my heart
She's a cruel woman, at least so far

[Verse 2]
I'll follow her anywhere that she goes
Her gaze makes my bones so cold
She knows everything that I'll ever know
Her body is cast in gold
My baby's got other things on her mind
Where no-ones allowed inside
It's okay with me I'll take in her view
Shes all that I want to do

[Chorus]
She's so cool
She's a moon woman, she's in my heart
She's a cruel woman, at least so far
She's a moon woman, she's in my heart
She's a cruel woman, at least so far

[Outro]

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
You ain't gotta answer none of my calls
I'm believing you'll pick up one day
I don't wanna add to your pain at all
I'm praying that time makes a change in your life
I'm realizing how much you made a change in my life
And I don't wanna spend it with nobody else
Hear me? Don't nobody deserve myself
Oh no, baby what I'm saying is

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Calm down, don't rush, no pressure

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Thought that you were in it for the paper
Never thought I'd take you serious
Now I need you, not a moment later
Losin' it, I'm so delirious
And I'ma put up a fight for it
Never give up a love like this
Finally I found someone
That can do me like no other
Talking to my conscience
I made a few mistakes
I did it to myself
I'm the only one to blame
I know you need a little while to believe again
To love again

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
I'll be waiting for you
Don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Don't rush, no pressure

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
Put my key in the ignition
Don't rush it girl, just stretch it out for me
I know that you ain’t got no place to be
Girl I need your attention
And every time I see you make that face
I wanna love you all over the place
Don't do it, baby
Don't do it to me, no, no

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
I know you don't wanna talk, right
We've been on and off like the cross lights
You heard I'm playin' with them hoes like I golf, right?
When I touch you, I get frostbite
Girl you're so cold, so cold, so cold
How we so young but livin' so old?
In the bed together but we sleepin' solo
That could drive you loco
You supposed to be my uno, Yoko Ono
Oh no, round two again
We've been fighting more than Ryu and Ken
Last time we argued eight straight days
I learned my lesson, I got straight As
And I know it's deeper than masseuses
Oh, you know I eat the cookie like I'm Lucious
Go ahead and take the time
But it's a waste of time if your waist ain't on mine
Think about it

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You ain't gotta make your mind up
(make your mind up)
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
(right now)
Don't rush, no pressure
(there ain't no pressure)
You ain't gotta make your mind up
(no ohh)
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
(I'll be waiting for you)
Don't rush, no pressure
(baby don't rush)
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Don't rush, no pressure
(You can take it easy now)
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
(And I'll still be right here)
Don't rush , no pressure

[Outro: Justin Bieber]
Say yeah, say yeah
You ain't gotta make your mind up now
Know I did you wrong
Let your heart heal
Don't rush, no pressure

[Hook]
Chinese AK just do what I say and nobody die
I open the soda, I get the codeine and I pour up a lot
I pour up a lot, I pour up a lot
Me and my niggas, we go up a lot
We so up, you not
D'usse, D'usse, when I get home I'mma throw up these shots
When I got home I was so drunk I knocked
So drunk I knocked and the door was unlocked
Went in the kitchen and grabbed me a pop
Got my codeine and I poured up a lot
I pour up a lot

[Verse 1]
I pour up a lot
I got more than a doc, my soda gonna pop
Strong as boulders and rocks
My shoulders gon' drop, you know I know I'm so high
I could have swore I saw Pac
Could have swore I saw Spock
My motor don't stop
I stay on my feet, no hole in my socks
You know I'm on deck, when there's snow, I'm on top
I'm stored up on stock
I'm way up, but I'm sure you're not shocked
Cause you know how I rock
And you know that it's cocked
The .44 with the dot
I'm a pro with the Glock, don't you go to the cops
Or your throat gon' get chopped
Then your folks gon' get got then your ho gon' get shot
Kiss that ho if she hot
Hitting notes on my cock like Do Re Mi Fa
And all you lookin' ass niggas look at me now
I'm sure you gon' watch, you boring, I'm not
I'm scoring a lot, ignoring the thots
I'm pouring a lot, taste like euphoria, uh
Russian AK, do what I say and nobody die
I open the soda, I get the codeine and I pour up a lot
I pour up a lot
I sew up the block, make you go off the block
I'm getting twisted with 2 bad bitches in my bedroom
Leave them hoes in a knot
Stomach in knots, thought I need some drank
I'm stuck in my bed and the dopeman said all he got is red
If I don't do red, Lord, I don't do red
I don't do yellow, no, I don't do that
I don't do Qualitest, I don't do Hi-Tech
I need that Act
I don't do yellow cause it make me scratch
As soon as I seen niggas sippin' green
I was like, "where they do that"
Bring that shit back, let me bring this shit back

[Hook]
Chinese AK do what I say and nobody die
My soda so dirty, I can't even lie
When I need peace of mind I just pour up a lot
I pour up a lot
Me and my niggas, we go up a lot
We so up, you not
D'usse, D'usse, when I get home, I'ma throw up these shots
When I got home I was so drunk I knocked
So drunk I knocked and the door was unlocked
Went to the kitchen and grabbed me a pop
Didn't even measure, just poured up a lot
I pour up a lot

[Verse 2]
I run in your building and hold up the spot
Give me what you got, the keys and the gwuap
Make everyone get on their knees and then count
My bitch talking 'bout kicking me out
Cause every time she want the soda we out
Bitch, I don't want no lip, I just want some mouth
I just want a sip, I don't wanna drown
I just want the lean, I don't wanna bounce
I just wanna chill, I don't want a crowd
I just want my check, I don't want a trial
I just want some neck, I don't want no mouth
She just wanna love, I just want lounge
I just smoke loud, she just drink brown
I just drink purple, she just smoke hookah
Quit cigarettes, concerned ‘bout her future
I pour up a lot, past, present, future
Syrup and sprite, turn that shit fuschia
Hawaiian Punch, Alo-hallelujah
We got that white girl workin' like Hooters
My shooters don't listen
I tell 'em you cool, but still they don't listen
I cut on the news, and they say you missin'
And I can't stop grinnin' like, "nigga, we did it"
And they show police fishin'
And searching under bridges when they say no witness
I start hopping around like Jiminy Cricket
And I can't stop sippin'
And she can't stop stripping
Cause she got an infant and her man in prison
Lord, she can't stop ventin'
And I can't stop drifting, she worry a lot
And I pour me a lot
I pour up a lot, I pour up a lot
Don't know how to stop, I don't know how to stop so
I pour up a lot, pour up a lot
I pour up so much I don't know it's a lot
I pour more than a lot, I go over the top

[Outro]
(Oohh boy)
Yeah, again and again, etcetera
I pour, I pour up in
Cream  soda, Sprite, Seven-Up
Fuck it, here we go again
Medicine, medicine, yeah
I need that, I need script
I don't need no discount, I leave you a tip
They said that Actavis dead, that's bullshit
Well if so then I must be the exorcist
I don't know what you heard but you heard wrong
I got a swamp up in my Styrofoam
It can be room temperature or lukewarm
All I need is ice to make the perfect storm
I pour up a lot

[Verse 1]
It's so cold in the D tonight
Better layer up, it'll be alright
All alone and got nothing to do
'cept to lie awake and dream of you

[Chorus]
Cause it's heat, baby
I know heat is what she needs
Because she talks to me about heat, baby
I know heat is what she needs
Because she talks to me about heat

[Verse 2]
I can see you laying down alone
No one hangin' out when you're feelin' low
Yeah the ice is on the streets out there
Keeps you under covers with your smooth skin bare

[Chorus]
And it's heat, baby
I know heat is what she needs
Because she talks to me about heat, baby
I know heat is what she needs
Because she talks to me about heat, baby
I know heat is what she needs
Because she talks to me about heat, baby
I know heat is what she needs
Because she talks to me about heat

[Outro]
She talks to me about heat
Oh baby, she's talking to me about heat
She's talking all night long

[Verse 1]
White bird in a black cloud
You flap, eyes rolled back
Medicine gave you a heart attack
Big fight for a small right
First flight into white light
Pull the trigger, love at first bite
Big plan for a big man
Tough change for a tough guy
Twitching out the corner of your eye

[Verse 2]
White bird in a black cloud
Rain comin' down, thinking hey
Maybe we should turn this boat around
Heaven - maybe freedom
What's the word? Right, I forgot
Quiet is the closest thing we got

[Verse 1]
Walking through the crowd of villages a gloom
Lot of 

[?]
Heartbeats under cold
Everybody here wanted something more
Searching for His Glory that I heard before

[Chorus]
Oh, Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
We’ve been waiting
Oh, Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

[Verse 2]
It’s a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat forevermore
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you, oh welcome
When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts and put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else here before
Then you can get what you want
Boys and boys, girls and girls

[Chorus 1]
Oh, Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
We’ve been waiting
Oh, Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

[Verse 3]
It’s a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat forevermore
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me
Welcome to New York
Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
Like any real love, it’s everchanging
Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
Like any real love, it’s everchanging
It drives you crazy but you know you wouldn't change a thing
It drives you crazy but you know you wouldn't change a thing

[Chorus 2]
Welcome
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It’s been waiting
We’ve been waiting
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York (2x)

I push out a large amount of Encante Serum. It's getting somewhat cooler. Let's go out there and attempt to follow these steps. Encante Serum was their favorite for a very long time

There are a plethora of inclinations in that department. That isn't something measurable. Get stuffed! I'm returning to the salt mines. I'm just following in their footsteps. This Encante Serum should not be resold. I presume that we can reach a mutual understanding. This could change. Luckily, how can I win? Keep reading to find out the secrets of my success. In this essay, I am going to cover Encante Serum and maybe in future articles I will Encante Serum

[Verse 1: Jake]
You see with golden eyes
The novocaine lullaby
Reach and crack the sky
With an open mouth, peace inside
American eyes
Cherry cheeks and bloodshot eyes
American eyes
See peace on earth and truth in lies

[Chorus: Jake]
Violet, trying to start your riot
Trying to get up and then go
So the world will always know
Violet, you and your fucked up riot
Trying to get up and then go
So the world will always know

[Verse 2: Jake]
Then you'll come to me
With a bitter wind, in agony
Clean the reds, you'll see
The sky is lost in the company
Of those American eyes
See good on earth and truth in lies

[Chorus: Jake]
Violet, trying to start your riot
Trying to get up and then go
So the world will always know
Violet, you and your fucked up riot
Trying to get up and then go
So the world will always know

[Bridge: Jake & Whistler]
You go, go, go, you go, go, go

If you wonder how I do
In the right place
With the left hand
On the wrong time
There are no mistakes don't get it confused
Was it my fault?

[Verse 1]
Fuck that I'm losing my cool
I know that's not your cousin you think I'm a fool
See, drive three hours to kick it with you
Now I'm 'bout to catch a case for killing this dude
Look me in the eye say it ain't true
Tell me what I did, what I didn't do
What could turn a woman that cynical?
Was you really that miserable?
Wouldn't believe all the pussy I passed up
I was saying I'm loyal they were saying I'm gassed up
Shit I feel like a clown, I feel like a damn shmuck
Racking my brain I remember the small subtleties
All in my face, talking 'bout how you was in love with me
How could you love another one, no-one could ever fuck with me
I let you meet my mother, cooked you food when you was hungry

[Hook]
If you wonder how I do
In the right place
With the left hand
On the wrong time (Don't fucking touch me!)
There are no mistakes don't get it confused
Was it my fault?

[Verse 2]
Who's mine
Call me if you wanna call me
I'm already leaving
Headed out the driveway
Once I've found my keys in
The weathers looking mighty fine this evening
Hope you excited to see me
Got a new t-shirt, expensive cologne
I got a fresh haircut, new socks and drawers
I waited all week for you
As I'm rolling up my reefa...there's something wrong

[Verse 3]
Remember dude with red bottom shoes walking out your front door
I rolled my window down (Who the fuck is this clown?)
No need for reaction
On how did this here happen
It's now all in my 

[inaudible]
Never seen it coming
Wasn't even watching

[Hook]
If you wonder how I do
In the right place
With the left hand
On the wrong time
There are no mistakes don't get it confused
Was it my fault?
Let me take you by the neck
And I'll show you how much I care about
Let me take you by your hand
And I'll hold you so you never leave again
Don't you understand ?

Let me take you by the neck
And I'll show you how much I care about
Let me take you by your hand
And I'll hold you so you never leave again
Don't you understand ?

Eh-
And I'll show you how much I care about
Let me t-, eh-
And I'll show you how much I care about
Let me t-, eh-
And I'll show you how much I care about
Let me take you by your hands
And I'll hold you so you never leave again
Don't you understand ?

[Verse 1]
And hey, would you like to look outside sometimes? (No!)
I'm just with my friends online
And there's things we'd like to change
(Oh! Yeah)
Next thing you'll find you're reading 'bout yourself on a plane, fame, what a shame (Oh!)
Well, just keep looking, looking, looking, looking!

[Chorus]
And love me (Yeah)
If that's what you wanna do, oh (Yeah? No)
And love me (Yeah)
If that's what you wanna do, oh (Yeah? No)

[Verse 2]
You've been reading 'bout yourself on a plane, fame for a change
Caught up in fashion, Karcrashian panache
And a bag of bash for passion
You got a beautiful face, but got nothing to say (Oh!)
"You look famous, let's be friends
And portray we possess something important
And do the things we'd like"
"We've just come to represent
A decline in the standards of what we accept!"
Yeah, yeah, yeah? No

[Chorus]
And love me (Yeah, oh)
If that's what you wanna do, oh (Yeah? No)
And love me (Love me, yeah)
If that's what you wanna do, oh (Yeah? No)

[Interlude]

[Bridge]
Oh, so sack off your calendar, give it to the people
Be the man that gets them up on their feet
Say "Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"

[Chorus]
And love me (Yeah)
Oh (Yeah? No)
And love me (Yeah)
If that's what you wanna do (Oh, yeah)

[Intro: Kobe]

[Hook: Kobe]
The game fucked up and she almost gone

[Bridge]
Oh, look at me when the beat drop

[Verse 2]
They want to turn the undefeated to the underdog
Only concerned with money, I’m paying none of y’all
I overcame all odds, I ain't run at all
Everything under the sun, I done done it all
I want it all, and I’ma go get it
Even if it mean I got to take on the whole city
I’ma stay busy, chase that billi
Stack those so high, hoes get dizzy
Make my bank match my ambition
On a mission tryna spend what I can’t take with me
Listen, no bullshit homie real talk
And you ain’t gotta like me I’ma still ball
Even if I choose to take a couple years off
Upon my return, I’ma still floss
Even harder though, so let the robber know
“Hey haters do you thing, got my shine regardless though”
When it seem like it’s over, I’ma make a wave
By whatever means and that’s what make him Dre
My heart consumed with determination got to say
Let them Bogart, I’ma go hard all day

You see I ain't never had no girl
That could really rock my world

Never, never, never, never
Never had nobody
Never had a woman like you
(a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman)
Do the things you do ( a woman like you)
(Verse 3)
Never had a woman
That had a heart of gold
A mind of steel
Rock my soul with her sex appeal
Run her nails up and down my thighs
She's the essence of my pride
She sets the fire in my bed
She's the neck that turns my bed
She's the neck that turns my head
Woman that makes feel like a king
For her, I'll do mot anything
Woo

(chorus)

(Never, never, never, never)
Never, never, never, never, never
(Never, never, never)
Never, never, never had
A sweet, sweet woman like you

To do the things you do (whole lot of woman)
I'm telling the truth baby
Got to have me ( a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman)
Got to have me a woman
A woman like you baby, (To do the things you do)
Right on time, baby (girl you blow my mind)
I never had (a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman,)

Never, never had nobody (x2)
Never, never had me a woman (yea baby)
A woman like you (do the things you do)
A woman with a plan (that knows how to treat a man)

(chorus)

[Written by Julia Michaels, Justin Tranter, and Justin Bieber]

[Verse 1]
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try, but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice, I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Verse 2]
I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Bridge]
I'm not just trying to get you back on me (Oh, no, no)
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body (Your body)
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
Lou Stoppard:
Kanye West, welcome to SHOWstudio. We're gonna be answering questions from some of your fans, some of your friends, some of your peers. But the first question I wanna ask you, it's actually from me, so Lou from London. You're one of the most famous men in the world and I think everyone has an opinion about you - I really noticed that as we were preparing for this interview. Everyone thinks they know you. I've watched quite a lot of your interviews recently and you've really talked about this idea of not being heard. There's quite an irony to that cause you have such a huge direct reach, but I got the sense you've really felt you were not being listened to or not being understood. Do you think everyone fully understands Kanye West? Or do you think you're very different to your public persona? Have you created that in some way?

Kanye West:
Yeah, I think there's people who understand. They see it. That's the same people who see an earthquake coming on, or see a tsunami coming.  I think there’s people who don’t want to embrace what it really is so they use their position of like class, or snobbery, or whatever comments they have, to just try to always down things and to not give it its just due, or just opportunity as a form of discrimination. You know, most people don't understand who they are. So people's misunderstanding to me is a misunderstanding to themselves. That they don't understand that he's not being the projected version of himself. He's not what he was taught by current society or taught by this lifetime. He's evoking something from another place and this is unfamiliar; it's alien to us. You know, it's easier for us shun it, than to really try to dig deeper and find out more about it. It's funny that so many people that are supposed to be like so super educated love to just pick the lowest hanging fruit of a concept of fame or celebrity. as a way to diminish or to take away the validation of what is being done up to this point and what will be done in the future.

LS: Talking about what you did in the past and what you want to do in the future. A question that was submitted by one of you fans, Sam Hollis. He said, what do you consider your greatest contribution to music, but also your greatest contribution to creativity?

KW: Well, I'm answering the second question first. The greatest contribution to creativity is taking away the bullying. Well, I'm sure that I've bullied myself sometimes, but taking away people being able to bully you because you're a creative. We're bullied and controlled by organisations and money and the people with money are in power. And that's gonna change after me and Kim's lifetime. It's gonna go more back to when people used to philosophise and talk about proportions and shape and colour and what we can do for the next generations, but right now it's all about what people can do to make the most money and how they can not cut in creatives in any profit and use creatives against themselves in a way.  Like if they know someone is a genius but not business smart, they take advantage of that. So, me constantly fighting that on the front line I think is the greatest thing I’ve tried to open up, so that creatives can be more empowered, because I believe the world can be saved or helped, and the world meaning us as human beings, our civilisation, us as a race, as one race, can be helped through allowing people with more positive motives, who see more colours than just green. To help be at least a part of the conversation and be heard and listened to. What was the first question?

LS: It was about your greatest contribution to music, but maybe you don’t think like that anymore?

KW: Yeah… music synthesis. Just to synthesise. To take Mos Def and bring him to the studio with Jay Z, I think is the greatest... When people say ‘oh this is backpack or this is gangster,’ or to go on tour with Roc-A-Fella with a chain and have people boo me and be like ‘Roc-A-Fella is not hip hop’ and fight against that. Now, it’s considered to be one art form. Like what Louise Wilson would always talk about, there’s this juxtaposition, high, low, these opposites and combining them. This combination that makes a greater civilisation and a greater human being. The actual human being a thousand years from now, generally, as a race we should be far advanced. Like at the beginning of ‘Prometheus’, like how that guy was just like *chtchhhhhe noise*. He was like Mike Tyson meets Steve Jobs meets Shakespeare as a person. There was a time when people were working on multiple things and have multiple art forms and businesses and different things that they could do but now you’re only supposed to be able to do one thing and in the future, people will be highly skilled in a lot of things because they won’t be afraid to fight for their education

LS: I think it makes people uncomfortable, doesn't it, when people try and kind of get themselves out of their box. They see musicians as musicians and when you do fashion it makes people annetuate. This relates to a question that came in from Nick Knight - he runs SHOWstudio, who you collaborate with a lot. He talks about your bravery. He said you seem, sort of, be open to make very brave decisions. And I think in some points that relates to pushing yourself into new arenas. He gave examples like opening Black Skinhead with three black KKK hoods and not putting New Slaves on YouTube or appearing naked in the Black Skinhead video. He's interested, do these decisions feel brave at the time? Do you feel brave? And maybe what's the bravest thing you've ever done?

KW: I mean, there's nothing to be afraid of, really. I don't ever wanna take to much credit for being brave. That's just a responsibility of ours, as artists, to give our truth at time. And it's just as simple as that. Soldiers are brave, they have a serious responsibility to go fight for their countries, police officers are brave, fire fighters, it's their responsibility to go into a fire. And for the rest, an artist's responsibility to give our truth. I just think more than courage or bravery, it's just, I...

LS: Honesty?

KW: Yeah, honesty. Maybe the answer didn't... some answers I'm gonna give are not gonna make complete sense, if you're a very literal-by-the-book person. You might find a flaw in the final finishing. I suppose you understand the just of what I'm saying. And, you know, the other day I came up with an equation that explains the way visionaries think, I suppose to very calculated people. As someone as you, get 2 and 3, most people will say 5. If you put 2 and 3 in front of me, I'm gonna say: well, 2 plus 3 is five, 2 times 3 is 6, 2 divided by 3 is this and 3 divided by 2 is that and then come up with an average of all those things. And then when you say 5.76 blah blah blah, that's the thing that people marvel at. Like, wow, that really was not what I was expecting or not what we wanted to put you in a box for. But I felt I got something more out of it and that is the calculation of the Zeitgeist. Because everything changes, every day something changes. People get so caught up in the embarrasment of changing their mind in front of someone. And one thing can change everything. So you have to put that, as a part of your 2 and 3. You don't have to, I have put it as a part of my 2 and 3 equation.
LS: It's interesting you use the world visionary there. A lot of our viewers, they ask questions about that term and about the term 'creative genius'. Sam Thompson, he has this question where he said, you've called yourself that and equated yourself to these different people; Da Vinci, Walt Disney, Steve Jobs, Michaelangelo. He asks, how would you define a genius in that context? But also, why do you feel the need to call yourself that?

KW: Because otherwise I'm called celebrity. I'm called nigger. I'm called rapper. And when they use the word celebrity, nigger, rapper, isn't that in a positive way. And all these things, all these words,  can be used in an extremely positive way: "what's up my nigger", you know. But that's not the way it's used. So I have to define who I am. All of my aspirations are the things that currently only sixty-year old white people do. So I have to redefine and let people know exactly who I am and it's not letting them know by, you know, wearing a suit or letting them know by wearing a Rolex or letting them know by bragging about how much money a sponsorship made on top of a rap. It's letting them know by saying, "let's start with this, I'm a creative genius". *Laughs* It's proven and now we'll continue to prove it. When people try to take the piss out of me for clothing and this and that. They never think about the fact that I've never had the opportunity to be properly educated and if given the meanings to be properly educated or given the proper support groups, I would completely shhh, light the lights up. We sell shoes that people wanna line up for because we put love in them, we put heart in them, we want to make Christmas presents, we want to make something that people want so bad that it hurts them if they can't have it. It not a... it's not a... just a financial oppertunity, cause you need finances. But it's a form of discrimination and racism, especially with blacks and fashion. And it literally, you know, it took me, being Kanye West, to get this far in fashion. Meaning, I was being able to become a multimiljonair and invest in myself, because no one else would have. I got this employee, that's a black guy and there will be, sometimes there will be a piece of misinformation. Three weeks later he'll tell me something and he says it kinda, like, with his voice down. I remember being with my dad and my dad was the type of dad that would be everybody's dad. A guy would come in and sell some cookies, but my dad was a sellsman also. So he's saying, "excuse me, I got these cookies" and he'd say "yo, sir, pick your head up and explain to me what you wanna say and what you wanna sell". This guy, this employee, because blacks especially in America have been raised with slave mentality, don't feel they have the right to speak as loud as possible. And everytime you hear a black person speaking as loud as possible, it's after someone's gotta say "look at this niggers over there". So if you don't want to be called a name in a derogatory way. You'd rather put it in what's people's favorite word to use for me? Humble? But if we go on your iPhone on a dictionary and look up the word humble, eighty procent of the definition is negative. It's a controlling word. It's a way to control the masses and to control the sheep. Yeah, I think there’s a level of reality to being nice, to being cordial to people. But if you have the ability to lead, you are a leader. You have the answers or you have the ability to find people with the answers and your will is to help. You should not be humble, you should speak up, because this world is broken. So someone needs to say something and sometimes I just feel like the only one that's not crazy.

LS: I want to ask you a question that's relatable to what you were saying. The question came in quite a lot, but it was posted particularly nicely by Aravin Sandran, he's 25 and from London. And he said, "do you think the resistance and criticisms to your work is being partly because you're a black man. Would your ideas and work received differently if you were a white man?"

KW: If I was a white man that became a really successful musician, that box would have put me in a chamber that would have said that I shouldn’t work. So there’s a lot of white people that if they’re really super good at something, they also get discriminated against in another field. You could be a photographer and someone would say you can’t be an artist. You could be a designer and someone would say you can’t be a musician or someone would say you can’t be a film director. As far as the advantages in life, yes, if you are born white, you have that on your gene pool. Currently because the world is controlled by whites, you have that as a 100, as an advantage, and if you add a couple of other things to it, you have a very high chance of success. Whereas, because the world is run by whites currently, if you’re born black, if you make it to something like the Met Ball or the Grammys, most likely you’ve done ten times the amount of everyone else there to get there.

LS: It's interesting, Simon Foxton, who's a stylist. I know you know his work. Asks the question that relates as well. He said, your clothing line has been greeted with a lot of harsh criticism. Do you reflect like a lot of designers do, where they take that criticism and they use it to kind of develop their aesthetic and change their work? So do you do that? Or does it just make you even more convinced in your belief and vision?

KW: Yeah, I’m convinced that I know what I like and I know that I just know. I know and I don’t care. I don’t care because anyone that is criticising, most likely they saw the 350s and acted like they didn’t like them because they’re racist and discriminatory. They’re not only racist against black people; they discriminate against celebrity. They discriminate against people with multiple art forms. Or they could say, ‘Oh wait a second, that cut wasn’t that good,’ but they do enough to throw a stab at, ‘Oh that didn’t fall the right way’ or ‘That wasn’t styled the right way.’ But they didn’t do the research on how difficult it was to one by one put together a design team and to fight against the idea of celebrity, to get overcharged because you’re a musician or people feel like you have money, to get completely taxed by the fashion world. And I love it because it’s like going to Harvard. That’s the reason why I’m in fashion. I think it’s the ultimate training because I dropped out of art school. Eventually, I got a PHD this year, like a honorary PHD at the Art Institute of Chicago. I dropped out of that school and I wanted to go back to the school of hard knocks. Right now, in all honesty... You know whatever the fuck I’m going to say today, I’m going to say it and I’m just gonna fucking own it and that’s how I feel right now. If I feel differently in three years, I’ll tell you how I feel... but right now, the highest art form is actually fashion. What’s funny about that is people in art look down at fashion designers. It’s like a class... I mean, where’s architecture? The most energy currently is around fashion because with music, it’s in question if a song is popular, if that person is really a good artist or not. In fashion, for the most part, if someone is really popular, it’s because it’s agreed upon that they’re an amazing artist. They’re amazing at what they’ve done. People do the history on what their background is. Did they intern for Christian Lacroix? Did they work at Margiela for a period? They find out what the history is and see if that someone is making a connection to something that is current, that’s relative, that is in touch. And fashion designers are superstars currently too. It feels like hip-hop felt to me in the nineties. It’s like, me, I’m a hip-hop artist but it’s like why are you going to the fashion world? I mean it’s just a really interesting art form. It’s just a different art form. Business is an art, the way you talk to people is art, an interview can be an art, everything is a form of art. I appreciate the critics because when I see the collection I just did and when I used the stretch French Terry that I found in Japan and I use on market canvas, like heavyweight canvas, and I put it in my colour palette and I see 64 different tones come down together, you know, I’ve created like a moving expressionist painting and that satisfies me. So if someone was to go up to a Monet and say, ‘This dot wasn’t Louis Vuitton level,’ it’d be like, ‘What do you mean?’ It’s all an expressionist painting. By the way, you know we die. 80 years, 60 years, 50 years, you know we will die. But on that day, I lived.

LS: A question that came in from Natalie Wo, it goes back to what you said about your dad. Your dad was in the Black Panthers and your last collection did have a very political undertone. It was very much about racism.

KW: Wait a second, is that a white person who said that?

LS: I don’t know her ethnicity

KW: I think it’s racist when white people assume when a black person uses colour, it’s a political statement.

LS: Were you not making a political statement?

KW: No! It’s a painting. It’s beautiful colours. That statement is not gonna stop the murders in Chicago. That statement is not gonna help people get jobs. That statement is not gonna take guns out of hands in Atlanta. That statement is not going to stop Zimmerman from bragging about… It’s such a thing like I had this one stylist come up to me and Virgil was standing next to me and said, ‘You need to watch out for him. He’s taking your place.’ And I was like, ‘Oh, the one spot for the black guy at the dinner table in fashion? That place? Is that what you’re talking about?’ So the assumption that my artistic expression of clothing has something to do with race or politics - a more politically correct term ironically for racism - is racist in itself.

LS:  A lot of fashion designers do see their work as political so maybe that’s why people see your work as political or about social issues. Perhaps it’s a compliment. They want to read something into your work because they think it has depth and it matters. It doesn’t seem like you see it like that? Like McQueen’s work for example, people saw it as political.
KW: Yeah, I’m not gonna let anyone score points on me. If someone asks me about something, I’m gonna block all shots and I’m not gonna take any free points. I’m not gonna have someone say, ‘Oh I heard you knocked that guy out two weeks ago while this happened,’ and I would be like, ‘Oh yeah…’ No. If it wasn’t my intention for it to be political and everyone gives it this credit, and somehow they’re giving it a credibility, I’m like well no… I don’t even want that kind of credit. I don’t want anything that I don’t deserve. I just want a chance to drink at the clear fountain. I just want a clean shot. I just want a clean bat to swing, I want a clean bat to be able to swing at the ball with. Every one of these questions are gonna show the amount of dirt that’s actually on the bat.

LS: Do you think it would be easier for you if you weren’t famous then?

KW: Yeah, being famous is like the n-word. People remind me at every meeting about how famous I am. But somehow…. No, it wouldn’t be easier. The answer is absolutely no. You need fame in order to sell your shit. That’s why people pay for advertisers. So I’m basically the first of a celebrity that approached his entire career and life like he was an old bag brand that went and re-did itself and went and got a really cool designer that Anna Wintour suggested, to revitalise it and became a really big brand… Meaning like celebrities have always had a way that they were supposed to do business with licensing deals and this and this, but I always approach myself in a luxury way whether it’s calling Nick Knight a million times to work with him or going to factories in Italy or begging Tessiclub which hasn’t called me back yet to use their fabrics because they do Celine and Lanvin. I’ve always fought just to have better paints to work with. When I was in high school, I was at this national competition where I did a watercolour and the colour was really intense and I lost the competition because the judges were confused. They said either it’s not really watercolour because the paint was too thick or I used watercolour in the wrong way. So I lost because of that. I don’t know where those judges are today but…

LS: It wasn't the best feedback. You mentioned Anna Wintour and I wanna bring her up. She actually sent us a question for you. She said, what will you name your son and what do you hope for him as he gets older?

KW: I don’t have a name for him, but what I hope for him is that he can feel purpose, that he can learn, that he has the opportunities. The other night, I was driving in Paris and I saw these three high school kids running at top speed. I don’t know if they were chasing a guy or what. Once they got up to the street, there was a bus pulling off and they’re beating on the side of the bus. Then I looked at the time and it was 1am so that might be the last bus of the night. And I was really saddened because I was like, ‘How can I make my son feel that?’ Because once you’ve felt that, none of these fucking questions matter. When you’ve missed that last bus before, when you had the opportunity to get on the bus, you don’t give a fuck about any of this.

LS: When have you felt that?

KW: When I’ve missed the last fucking bus! Going through the streets of Chicago and having to sleep downtown in a parking lot.

LS: Do you still get that feeling today about different things?

KW: No, it’s almost like not feeling anything. It’s almost like being numb because of what I went through. There’s an employee that I’m about to hire that was the global manager of accessories at a really good company and she was really direct in the way she was talking. Then she went into this thing about how she stayed in a concentration camp till she was five years old and she didn’t know that people actually took showers by themselves. After someone’s been through something like that, they could give a fuck less about fuck. It’s just like... be real. None of this facade.

LS: Do you care about the negative press coverage around you and your family? But also just the general coverage that your every move is scrutinised?

KW: Yeah. And that’s the reason why, with the help of Anna Wintour and other people, we have actually made a lot of positive press coverage. The majority of the press we get is actually positive because the majority of the things that we do are actually positive. And even the negative can’t outshine the truth. The truth shall come to light. You see it in front of you. You read this thing and they try to diminish me into some really simple concept and simple idea and every time someone has a conversation about this and that, they’re like, ‘Wow, it’s a possibility that he’s thinking about more things and he wants to contribute more than I thought.’ So, let me dig into what I think the gist is of what that person was asking. Do I worry about being in the public eye and raising kids? Yeah. Any situation you’re in, you’re going to worry about raising kids. But it’s champagne problems too. There’s people who can’t feed their kids. That’s something more to worry about. So I’m not going to sit here and complain about the so-called issues I have. These aren’t real issues. There’s people at war. There’s people trying to make it to London right now. It’s really fucking serious. You guys are talking to me about some celeb shit. That’s not real shit. You know what? I’m alive. I’m breathing. I did a show. We sell it. I’m doing a second collection. I have no problems.

LS:  Talking about the bigger things that do change who you are and completely affect your work. Carine Roitfeld, the stylist, she ask how has becoming a father changed the way you work?

KW: Well, the way it changed who I was... Three years ago, after this interview, I would have been on a train back to Paris to see the last of the shows and get that inspiration. And now, I’m on the first flight back home to see my greatest inspiration, that’s my daughter.
LS: A lot of people have asked about your daughter. A particular one has to do with having a daughter and how it's changed the type of explicit lyrics you put into a song. And the way you talk about women in your songs. That question came from Ashley Geevers. She asked if having a daughter specifically affected the way you depict women in your music.

KW: Having a family period has completely made me rethink the way I rap. You know people extend their brand for a long time. There’s true moments of genius and then there’s just moments of looking through the archives and placing shit together. So many people rate ‘My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy’ as one of the best albums. And ‘Yeezus’ and ‘808s & Heartbreak’ are so much better and stronger. ‘Dark Fantasy’ is almost like an apology record. ‘Power’ was the least progressive song that I ever had as a first single. It was like me going back and spending six dedicated months - it took over two years to release the album - but six dedicated months piecing together what people liked about me, to make an entire bouquet that they loved, that was the most listenable, that was the least challenging. People want to talk about how much they loved that like it was Thanksgiving dinner. And how long has Thanksgiving dinner been cooked for? And it’s great, you don’t want anybody changing things on Thanksgiving dinner. But you take ‘808s’ or ‘Yeezus’ where these albums got completely panned when they came out and then you see how they end up influencing things. So it’s that balance of doing something that gives you a blanket of comfortability for the listeners and for yourself that you can go on tour and do this and walk around and everybody thinks it’s so great and they’re really happy that you did something they liked. And then you’ve got the times when you just have to give them what you see as your future. Give them your innovation.

LS: And having a family gives you more motivation to do that? To be more true to yourself?

KW: No.

LS: That just comes from you?

KW: I just love my family.

LS: You talked about wanting to be given a shot and wanting to have your opportunity. Do you actually believe that one day you will be respected and regarded as one of the greatest of all time in fashion in exactly the same way you are in music?

KW: Of course. I’m Michelangelo. Of course. There’s a time when I’m sure there were people sculpting better than Michelangelo, but he made David. So as far as that question goes, is there a time that you can go on the internet and find a shoe that people want more than my shoes? Well go fuck yourself then if it isn’t and don’t ask me no stupid shit like that again. With the love.

LS: Do you ever experience self-doubt?

KW: No.

LS: Never?

KW: No.

LS: Even when you were little?

KW: No.

LS: Okay, good to know. One thing that came in from a lot of people: they picked up on that quote of your fashion being available to everybody. They want to know what that means and when it will happen because price point really relates to that.

KW: I’m not H&M, I don’t have giant factories. How can I get the price point to what I need to be if I’m running an eight person design team... I’m saying it’s going to take time to get there. This is what I’m saying when you don’t have the right tools. This is the question that everybody has to ask. If you had the Celine design team and the Nike design studio and the Zara factory, could you do everything that you thought you could do? And what would everyone’s answer be to that? Yes. But if you don’t have the Celine outerwear person or the factory or you don’t have the entire adidas studio and you don’t have the marketing team or the sales team, you can only do what you can do. And we are doing a lot with what we have. What we have is the highest level of communication that has happened in the entire universe. My wife. She’s like MTV and NBC and all this combined. Number one on Instagram. And then the entire family. And then you have me and my entire music family. Basically, there is no ad that you can put in any magazine that could somehow add up to any one of me or my friends or my family just walking on the street and getting photographed. That is the fucking reality of 2015 people!

LS: Does that make it easier to care less about critics? Because as you say, it doesn't really matter what they say. The percentage of people that would engage with that is a fraction of the percentage of people that would see one Instagram post from Kim.

KW: Yeah you know… I mean, what can I say about them? I appreciate everyone’s opinion, but I refuse to have a lesser opinion about myself.

LS: What specifically do you think fashion is missing that you can bring?

KW: I’m not even concerned about bringing something to fashion. I’m just... I just want to be five years old. You know, when I was five years old I picked out my outfit for kindergarten. I would go to discount furrier, my mum would take me to discount furrier and I would keep grabbing furs and say, ‘What about this one mum? Or this one?’ And they were always too expensive. The ones I liked when I was five. So I just want to be five years old. I loved clothes before I even knew a fuck about the fashion world. And I can’t let the fashion world jade anything or try to give me a reason, or purpose, or a lack of purpose, or acceptance or a lack of acceptance to anything to just who I am when I was five. When my grandfather had a store in Oklahoma and he’d go to the flea market and hustle to get the best prices. He’d go and re-do people’s furniture, he was a carpenter also. He took that store and he was able to raise a family in a time where the schools were still segregated and he named my mother Donda in 1949. He was predicting the future in 1949 and put himself in a situation where he was thirteen and his father put 50 cents in his hand and told him he was out of there. He raised himself in a situation to be able to put my mother into college to the point where she got a PhD and became the first black female chair of Chicago state University. And then had a son that she then named Kanye which meant the only one that would go on to combat every form of thought, of tradition, that the media have presented up to that point. So tell me about other people’s opinions again?

LS: Is it your family who have had the biggest impact on your creativity, your sense of self and what you produce? Or were there other influences? It feels like all your creativity came from your sense of self, which obviously came from your family. Or am I wrong?

KW: I can’t say where my creativity came from. I’m blessed to be talented. I would say that came from God. My ability to give a fuck about somebody’s opinion came from my family. My ability to fight for my creativity came from my family. I’m sure people would just take that Michelangelo comment I said earlier and would take offense to that and think ‘Whoa, he still won’t stop.’ Let me just explain the justification of that. The proof of that. Ask any musician, period, of the past fifteen years - and I would be the closest thing to that. Those were be the sonic paintings. Fashion, clothes are sculptures, wearable art. Now, if you think about any brand, do you love every single thing from a brand? Look at the few opportunities I got to collaborate with Louis Vuitton, Nike, Adidas, really established companies and the level of love and impact people have for that product. That had proper infrastructure. So I had to take the money I made from being the motherfucking Michelangelo of music of the past fifteen years and invest it in trying to build an infrastructure against all odds, and basically building a sculpture studio. So I wanted to raise the branch up a little bit higher on that low-hanging fruit everyone was going to snatch at.

LS: Why run for president? You have proven to be more influential than a president and running for office would limit your ideas. Everything you could do and would want to do as president can be done now. Other great leaders, Gandhi, Mandala, never needed to be elected to make a change, so why do you feel the need? (Caden Roberts, 14)

KW: Mandela got elected.

LS: Yeah, he’s fourteen, give him a break.

KW: Okay, I won’t start cursing at him. Certain things that I’m compelled to do in life, I don’t feel the need to find justification for.

LS: So you’re definitely going to do it?

KW: Yeah.

LS: When you made that announcement, was it something you decided on the day or did it just come in the moment that you felt that and you just said it?

KW: It had been talked about a lot for the past five years and talked about with my team and I decided I was going to announce it then.

LS: Do you think Barack Obama has done enough? A lot of people have asked you that.

KW: I don’t want to make comments or give opinions on what other people have done. I think he’s done a lot of great things and I think that there would be no chance of people even considering the concept of me running if he hadn’t have won.

LS: Will you run with a party or will you run alone?

KW: I don’t have all the answers right now.

LS: What do you plan to do? What are the some of the things you really want to do when you’re in leadership?

KW: I’d like to sit with engineers and come up with solutions and alternatives for people without opportunity that end up having to go through desperate measures or feel like life isn’t worth living or that other people’s lives don’t matter. I think that the way I collaborate with people and the way I empower the people I collaborate with is a different way to look at problem solving for the world than a normal political way. I just want to ask questions. I’ve already decide that when I’m on debates and I don’t know I’ll just say ‘I don’t know, I’ll get back to you with that’ and I’ll just consult with the top ten, top five people on the planet and if there isn’t an absolute right answer I’ll say ‘These are the two highest answers that we came up with right now,’ because it’s not about me. It’s we. That’s the whole purpose. It’s the skill set that brought me back from the original Taylor Swift moment, the skill set that took the little kid in the pink polo to the top of the rap game. That skill set that took a Nike designer and three Adidas designers and made the hottest shoe. The skill set that brought by wife to the cover of Vogue. All of these journeys that… Like these questions say, these absolute, like, this can’t be done, have been almost self-serving and that’s where it gets the I-I-I. It’s from me and it’s from my family. My family meaning my direct family, but what happens if there is a certain point where it doesn’t become about me and my family but my family becomes the human race. I can do all the fight, all of that confidence, all of that problem solving, all of that asking questions, all of that trying to find the best answers, and listening through… If I could maybe do that to help more people and you can help more people in a position of power to go back to the gentleman’s question earlier. These are just now in a theory form, but I am speaking from the heart.

LS: A few people have correlated the president run with your lyrics and particularly the lyric about 'No one man should have all that power.' It’s interesting, you just said you can change your mind, you can be wrong about things. Do you sometimes feel your own ideas have changed so much in the years you’ve been working?

KW: Of course because you get new information.

LS: Does it frustrate you though? Because people are inevitably going to draw the parallel between the lyric and the fact you’re going to run for president.

KW: That’s not frustrating. There were some things earlier that were frustrating to me because they were so backhanded and ignorant in their approach, not really embracing... But no one’s being like ‘Man, I know I saw people lined up for three days for your shoes but one day, will you be respected as a designer?’ I designed that shoe, didn’t I? I don’t see somebody else’s shoes getting lined up for. I think there are a lot of fourteen year old, fifteen year old, twenty-five year old, thirty-five year old people that respect me as a designer.

LS:  I met you at a dinner in Paris with Riccardo Tisci and we had a really great talk and one thing stuck in my mind. You said that you felt that there was a new form of racism called class, and no one was talking about it. I found that really interesting because I come from a radical background, my father was a Marxist and you told me your parents were also radicals. Can you explain to me more what you mean about that and is that something you want to explore further? (Bobby Gillespie)

KW: Yeah it’s... class is education. People not having the opportunity to be educated. The biggest thing that made me the uncontrollable whatever is simply by being educated. Simply being educated made me uncontrollable. It’s not that I needed to be controlled. I needed to be helped, I needed to be supported. I don't wish negative on anyone. I want positive for everyone. I want everyone to win. I don’t want to be in a competition with anyone. I just want people to be their best selves and live the happiest lives possible. If you keep information and opportunity away from people, certain people, a group of people, then it’s destined they will stay at a lower class. The combination of that and being American. Because I found sometimes when I’ve worked at other design studios in London before, I find that because of the way the government is set up, people won’t have the opportunity to say they will run for being the Queen. I’m going to run for the Queen! That’s from birth. And you couldn’t be the president of United States because you’re not a United States citizen. So it sort of circumcises your dreams from day one. Whereas American is like a land of opportunity when people can work their way, climb their way up through the class system. But to be truly honoured as a black person in what is a classless society, the final house in the suburban community with the white picket fence and to be looked at as an equal is still a lot of mixed kids away from that. But the world is mixing. Period. So in a thousand years, the world might just be completely, what would be known as black currently, but it would just be a new race, except for people whose main goal and focus at that time is to keep the purity of separatism. But I see the future as people being mixed. I think that other races are really attracted to each other and always have been, because I believe that we’re meant to, but taught to not. I was taught to never bring a white girl home when I was eight years old. But I like white girls. I liked black girls too but I still liked white girls. It was such a taboo. I’m sure, like I said in the Tyler song ‘I know you told your daughters don’t take home Jerom.,’ I’ll tell you from my single days that white women like black guys, I tell you that, but I think there’s something amazing about mixing the cultures and the amount of informations that both cultures bring to the table. Or three cultures or four cultures. You ask a girl and she’ll say: ‘I’m German and Portuguese and  Asian.’ Just when I gave you that right now. What do you picture in your mind? There are probably guys gong: ‘Ah shit, I have to meet this German-Portuguese-Asian girl right now!’ They already picture someone beautiful. Just by me naming different races together and having the idea that a woman is saying that she’s mixed with these, you picture automatically someone beautiful.

LS: A lot of people asked about your vision for the world and what you’d like it to be like. It seems like that mixing of ethnicities and cultures is the most important thing to you?

KW: I’m not telling people who they should sleep with. I’m just zoning in on what I feel today.

LS: Do you feel like if you haven’t dropped out, you would be where you are? Because I think education is important but maybe the ability to opt out of the system is also important.

KW: I think I would be further and more dangerous. Yes, education is important. I’m envious of people who have read multiple novels and multiple philosophy books. I wish I had more information. I’m thirsty for knowledge. I’m busy with my own ideas. I want to pick up a book and see something that sparks me and it makes me think of thirty things I want to do and I’ll put down the book and start working on that. I’m envious of information. So college dropout… Now me at my age I’m looking... OK what were the reasons why I lost money when I did this? What was the reasons why I failed at that? It all came to not having the playbook, to not having information. With me, when I work on fashion I’m sitting here in the woods trying to chop down trees screaming screaming at the top of my lungs: ‘Can somebody just throw me some water?’ and everyone’s sitting laughing at me. That’s the fashion world, that’s the fashion critics. Me sitting here, trying my absolute hardest and everyone just laughing at me. And only one person coming up with a camera and Nick shooting a shot that then shoots across the world and they say ‘Oh he’s working with Nick Knight,’ and then Pat coming in doing the makeup, they go: ‘Oh, he’s working with Pat,’ or Riccardo coming in and saying: ‘No you can’t talk about Kim, this is my friend right here,’ they say: ‘Oh wow, the hottest designer likes Kim.’ Then the fashion world is like: ‘Hmm maybe it’s okay.’ And then they come again and say: ‘What do you think we can capitalise off of this in some way? Well come, come! We can capitalise and shit!’ But they definitely were not fucking letting me in the shows, and fucking constantly laughing at me, and trying to keep the joke going. But you know, there’s a lot of tsunamis and earthquakes that hit where people were joking on the beach. So keep joking on the beach.

LS: The Kim thing is interesting to me. I feel, particularly working in fashion, I feel like I’ve watched it happen, the period where people were so critical and now they want her in their shows, they want to dress her they want her on the front row. That must upset you in a way because she’s your wife and as you said you love her. To see that U-turn, in a way, it’s great, because it shows how much people respect her and they can see how amazing her influence is, but also that back-handedness. Is that difficult? Because you must feel protective.

KW: It’s always, always… it’s better now than it was and I feel happy about that.

LS: We got a question from a guy who talked about gay people within music and within the rap world and stigma towards homosexual rappers. He talked about how you talk a lot about society moving past stigma and being accepting. He said do you feel that’s still a problem within music?

KW: Yeah, it’s funny. Isn’t it so funny how just the culture of different art forms is so different? I felt that I got discriminated against in fashion also for not being gay whereas in music, you definitely get discriminated against if you are gay. It takes some amazing talents to really break down that barrier. People don’t have a problem with white rappers now because Eminem ended up being the greatest artist and everybody thought that when Frank Ocean’s album dropped, that people were going to be like, ‘No, this is bad for his career,’ and he’s one of the greatest writers of all time... I feel like it’s so cliche to speak about him particularly related to this subject but there always are the people who broke the ground and I think he’s the one that broke the ground. People don’t give a fuck. They love his music so so much. It’s the people that break the stereotypes that make history but I just thought it was interesting to point that out about the fashion world and the music world and just culturally, it’s reverse discrimination.

LS: How did you feel when you heard that your stepfather was going to transition and become a woman? (Willo Perronc)

KW: You know the first thing I did think of is I thought about black radio hosts maybe possibly making jokes about it because the black culture is generally so homophobic. News cycles are just constantly… They’re just trying to find some news and some interesting things like, ‘This rapper has this transgender person in his family and…’ But then I was like fuck what people say. Fuck what people think. I feel proud to be in a family that has so many people breaking ground for the generations to come. I just feel like whoa reality show… like that’s so fucking new of an art form to the point where my wife and their family should have had plenty of Emmy’s by now. But reality shows are considered to be like rap was when the Mondrian wouldn’t let Run DMC and motherfucking Will Smith stay there because they were rappers... or the idea of a reality star not being allowed into a fashion show or not being nominated for their show even if it’s the longest running and the most popular and everybody I know watches it and shit. I feel proud that not only my contribution of the credibility that I gained and garnished from music - and just my general social opinions - that I could be next to a wave of thought of this is who I am. And that is all I’m about. Like fuck, to let your life be controlled by public opinion would be like asking to sit in traffic for the rest of your life. Meaning like you want to turn this way but there’s a car right here, you want to turn that way but there’s a car right there, you want to go a bit faster but there’s a car right in front of you, you want to just stop, cars start honking at you. That’s public opinion and Bruce just got off the exit sign and drove as fast as he wanted to. Oh sorry, it’s disrespectful to use that name but I’m still getting acquainted with what’s politically correct because it’s new, it’s modern. This is like Roman times, bro, this time that we have - this 100 years - is really the beginning of the future. We finally tapped into the type of technology and acceptance and thought that we need to... Look at the new pope. It’s a bunch of dope motherfuckers out here that are just pushing towards the future. It’s funny that I went to this train of thought off of Willo’s question because he is one of, if not the most important person in my creative growth. He is my number one instructor. He is the reason why I was able to know who Nick Knight was. He is my greatest home tutor and educator. As I said, I felt like I had the spark in me but Mike Tyson needed a custom model, Hercules needed that little trainer guy in that movie... He is my greatest cultural coach - as far as Helvetica fonts go - and operatic stages and you know honing and training and riding bikes around Paris and analysing and philosophising about you know where the future can go. And the whole idea of Donda and what we do with design and the way we’ve simplified things. Album covers are important again, stage shows are important the signs, long, only sonic outros to songs… This is all like an extension of my times and my trainings with Willo.

LS:  Hundreds of people asked this. Next album: When’s it actually coming? Tell us about the name. What are you trying to communicate with it?

KW: Well as I said when I first said that name, I wasn’t sure if I was gonna keep that name but I just felt like I didn’t want to walk around with the name So Help Me God for the amount of time I was working on the album. I just felt like that was a heavy backpack to carry. ‘SWISH’ just kind of lightened the load so I could let it be whatever I want it to be. So I could just work on the painting and find something which... actually me and Nick today… He just showed me a piece. I could say the idea but I was really inspired by some things and you can find the purpose through a painting, through a video, through a conversation, through a sunset, through a really tragic headline and it’s like I was collecting these vibes and just things that I liked but the album had no purpose. And it was finding something that’s like, wait a second okay, it can go to something like this, I always wanted to do this. I did Cool Summer because I wanted to shoot surround vision. I had this idea and for people out there who don’t know what surround vision is, I was performing with Jay Z one night on Watch the Throne and I was just looking at how the whole audience were experiencing the performance and I thought of this theatre experience where it was a screen above us, below us, to the left of us, completely peripheral, to the right of us, and three screens in front of us and then we made this gyroscope system and put iPhones on it and recorded some kids running across the street. You saw them on this side, then you saw them in front of you then you saw them on that side. You heard them (because we had a multiple speaker system), you saw the ground below you and you saw the sky above you. Two weeks later, we went to Qatar and shot a film… My idea - because I couldn’t get money from movie houses - I went to Def Jam and said look, I’ll just do an album and the whole point was to get the budget. I was thinking this should be easy, you know, I’ve got all these rappers on my record label and blah blah blah. Then I ended up having to rap on seven songs and taking a while to finish the album. It still has a lot of amazing songs and the idea was I wanted to do an album that’s more commercial on purpose. I want to show that I can make radio songs because before that it was 808 and Dark Fantasy. It was very heavy. I want to show I can do something that’s lighter. I gave you this whole example to say the reason that I did the album was just so I could shoot that film.

LS: A lot of people are asking about the films and what’s happening with them and when they’re going to get to see them.

KW: Hopefully, yeah… I’m working on some ideas on how to be able to bring it back. I don’t want to make an announcement yet of when I think I’m bringing Cruel Summer back but we’re working on something right now.

LS: In a lot of your last interviews, you focus so much more on fashion rather than music. It seems like your album has been delayed because you’re working on your clothing lines. Is fashion your main passion instead of music? Does music not excite you in the way it did a few years ago?

KW: No, it doesn’t excite me like when I heard Wu Tang. Of course it doesn’t excite me like that. It doesn’t excite me like when I was using auto-tune for my first time. It wasn’t my first time because I did it on College Dropout too. There were things to prove. There were purposes. There was Lauryn Hill and Dead Prez. There was this idea of mixing this kind of messaging meets the hotness of Rockafella and proving that this was a possible thing. I am an inventor. I am an innovator. It’s fine for other people to proliferate on an idea but I get excited by ideas, not by responsibility. So sometimes when I’m even writing a rap, it starts to feel like a big responsibility. If you look at Andre 3000 - one of the top five greatest rappers of all time - the majority of the time, he actually only had to write one verse... so as far as doing three verses, sometimes you start to feel more like you’re doing a talk show every night than doing some type of prophetic, every two year speech. I believe that there’s raps that I had that meant everything and I believe that there’s certain raps that were hot and there was something that meant something about hearing something that was just hot. So I’m not gonna say it meant nothing, but it meant nothing for lack of a better way to describe it, you know. People could want so many things out of you and you don’t want to let people down because of Michelangelo comments and things. You want to deliver genius, you want to prove people wrong, you want to prove people right that are fighting for you. And sometimes creatively because I’m held to task by the highest critics of every genre of art, I feel like I’m one of those guys that hundreds of years ago, they would steal something and their form of death would be to be tied to four horses then they’d whip all the horses at the same time and they’d pull the arms out of their sockets each way. That’s how it feels when I’m getting pressure from all the different angles. It feels like my arms and legs are being pulled out of my body at the same time.

LS: So there’s no chance the album you’re working on will be your last just to stop a bit of that pressure?

KW: I’d never call out what would be the last. I'd call out what would spark more inspiration. I will think of a philosophy or think of something I want to say. I think hm this would be a great opening line or maybe I want to abstract the way you even hear rap. A lot of people liked the original of ‘All Day’ better than the one that eventually got released and that was so much more like a freestyle but it left things really open which felt more like later Picasso works. Oh yes, as you guys know, I think I’m Picasso also or the closest thing to it. So lesser, equal or maybe even better. Maybe there’s something that’s more Cubist about the way I rap and that’s what I’m trying to find where. It’s like do you really need to paint every angel wing in? Their paintings weren’t completely finished. And here’s another thing. The majority of the things that are popular now are really directly based on something that I’ve done over the past ten years. You can pinpoint it. Like that was that album or that song.

LS: Does that annoy you?

KW: I think it’s amazing. I think I had a purpose. That was my purpose: to innovate. So if you hear something that sounds similar to something that I’ve done before, that is an extension of a new album for me.

LS: So a lot of the people you talk about who you really admire or who you think are talented, do you often see yourself in the work that they’re making?

KW: Yeah, completely.

LS: So people you’ve talked about working with or you’ve cited in conversations - Drake, Young Thug, all these different people - do you see that in their work?

KW: I’m not trying to specify people but I just feel like there is a lot of influence and you can almost pinpoint the moments when things happened. But also, I was heavily influenced by Radiohead and James Brown and Coldplay and Jay Dillon and Jay Z and Tribe and Pharside and Dr Dre or Quincy Jones or Teddy Riley. So all of that was in my work too.

LS: With your lyrical process, is it important to you that the listener completely understands explicitly what you’re saying, like with each line, or is it better that they just take the abstract emotional gist of the song?

KW: It totally relates to what I said earlier about finding... You know, I think that abstraction…  I wrote this thing down the other day. I hope my words don’t get in the way of how I feel, my meaning. But words, fuck, you know, it’s an extremely powerful tool that can be… I just like abstracting music. I like to listen to Coltrane and say this is amazing. I feel an era of that. I feel a rise of that, possibly coming after so many words.

LS:  A lot of people really relate to specific words. Carl Swaygan said he listened a lot to particular aspects of your music and he talks about suffering from anxiety and PTSD and he said your music has got him through a lot. He asked what gets you through similar things because maybe it’s your own music but he talks about when you’re feeling anxious or you’re feeling down or you’re feeling depressed. What do you turn to?

KW: I just talk to my wife.

LS: What did you do before that?

KW: Talk to my wife. Or talk to my would-be wife. I talk to my friends. I just talk. I get really explicit, you know, with the way that I feel at that time. I’m extremely open. That way, I can sweat the anxiety out. I open up the pores and sweat the anxiety out or sweat what I’m worried about or say, ‘What are we doing? If this is a game or this is a war, how many soldiers did we just lose? What can we do differently to win and to prove everyone wrong?’ I appreciate naysayers. I appreciate non-believers because also sometimes it’s weird for me when people do believe in me. Like someone’ll come up to me and be like, ‘Man, I believe you’re like Basquiat.’ People say stuff like that to me and I’ll just be like, ‘Wait a second, only I can say that about myself.’

LS: That’s a question that someone asked about the pressure you feel on yourself because things like, ‘I Am A God’, this sense of you being a divine power, does that scare you? Does that freak you out? Lots of people wrote in and they said lovely things like his music’s got me through the hardest time, he stopped me from committing suicide, he stopped me from fucking up my life. But you must feel a sense of pressure from that when people treat you like you are this kind of god to them.

KW: The reason why I made the song ‘I Am A God’ is so those people that feel less than can turn it up and say it loud and embrace it for themselves, that God is inside all of us. It wasn’t about specifically me. it was about us as a race; that we are an extension of God, that we all have god inside of us.

LS: One question that came in a lot was: If you could give yourself advice now to when you were dropping out of college, what advice would you give?

KW: There’s so many things that had to happen for me to be sitting here with you right now. It wouldn’t be truthful for me to give a statement as arrogant as ‘I wouldn’t change a thing’ because when I sit on a long flight to Paris, all I do is wallow in the things that I wish I could have changed, things that I would have tweaked. So as far as the college thing - I don’t seem to wallow on that that much but if you asked me a straightforward question about it, I’d say the more education, the better. The more you know… Well, sometimes you can know too much especially if you don’t have the opportunity to do things and it can drive you crazy. And that’s a bit of what the Yeezus period was like. To know that I was simply not succeeding due to lack of resource, due to lack of assistance, and to have shown so many times that you had an ability but for people to doubt your ability because you’re not playing your position; the position that they want you to play. You’re not tall enough to be centre or something like that.

LS: What was the scariest moment of your life?

KW: Probably my car accident. A lot of time, I try to find answers that are like, ‘Mmm I wouldn’t have expected that.’ But yeah, that was pretty scary.

LS: You talk about luxury and about the only luxury we have being time. What do you spend most of your time doing?

KW: Working on luxury. That probably is it. I do spend the majority of my time working on my goals to create this creative ecosystem that allows a bunch of ideas to flow through them. I’m sure Nick 

[Knight] could probably relate to that. I probably spend the most time on trying to create something that allows me to create everything.

LS: Thinking about improving the world. One question that made me laugh. It came from Boris Johnson, who the mayor of London. What would you do to make London better?

KW: Widen the streets, cause they get really scared.

LS: How do you think your portrayal through lyrics, visual, quotes of the black woman formed pop culture’s understanding of black women? And do you think it is within the function of contemporary black male rappers to uplift their female counterparts in the face of adversity?

KW: I definitely think generally, rap is misogynistic and it’s just a part of - not saying it’s justifying the culture - I definitely think I’ve said ‘Bitch, get out the car’ in some of my lyrics and stuff like that. And is there a responsibility? I feel like rap, for the 20 years that I’ve studied it, it’s only, as a whole, responsible to trend. So the only way that specifically what she’s talking about would be hurt more if it was more in style. Rap is a communication of trend. It’s a communication of the way people are in real life. It’s a communication of what someone just said to their girlfriend on the phone or an argument they just had or something positive that just happened. What I notice is, there was a time when we had afro-centric rap and everybody was like how common is. It was like ‘my queen, this, that.’ You haven’t even heard the word ‘queen’ so long in that context. What I’ve noticed is when I come home from a meeting with some head of a studio and I just get completely dissed and I show them a bunch of creative things - like on Despicable Me where he was trying to show his mum he could make a rocket and she was like whatever, that’s weak. That’s how it is going to meet with people in Hollywood and showing them your ideas. They just shit on you, like ‘We don’t need that, it’s weak.’ And I’ll come home and I’ll find myself being more irritated and maybe being more rude with my wife. So let’s take that to the idea of a black male in America not getting a job or getting fucked with at his job or getting fucked with by the cops or being looked down upon by this lady at Starbucks and he goes home to his girl and… Just to think about my frustration and if I was rude to my wife because of that, we are like super well off to the point where this guy is like, ‘I can’t take my kids school shopping if I knock my manager the fuck out if he says this to me one more time.’ They cannot drink the Ye juice at all. They cannot turn up at all. It’s like you scream at the person closest to you. This song that Chief Keef put out that I sang the chorus on - I was singing I scream at you cause I can’t scream at nobody else - and then take that and you go to a studio and that frustration and disrespect is now coming out towards the woman next to you or the women around. Like we can’t wife you, you’re just a thot, we can’t do this, blah, blah, blah. And the guys around are just like, ‘You’d better not say that to them or I’ma shoot you.’ It’s from lack of opportunity. It’s from being inside of traffic - that thing I told you earlier - that lack of ability to see a way out and you just start being frustrated inside of that space… and then you go into the studio and that’s what it’s gonna sound like. ‘I’ma shoot you, fuck you, bitch’ because that ‘fuck you, bitch’ came from America. That ‘fuck you, bitch’ came from our lack of opportunities. That ‘nigga, I’ma shoot you’ came from racism which is an amazing tool. It’s like if you could put racism in the battery of your phone, it would never stop working. It works on itself. It’s residual and shit. Residual racism is to be in a racist situation where you’re working at this fucking job downtown blah blah blah, they’re treating you like shit, and you go home and you’re just mad at everybody. It’s like black people don’t even like black people at a certain point. Racism is the hate that keeps on hating. And I said this thing, I was sitting with Steve McQueen when we showed our piece that we did on ‘All Day’ and it we put it in the LACMA. Let me say that again just to purely be a dick because I said that knowing it was a stunt and very intellectual. So me and Steve McQueen… I think it’s a very impressive thing to say shit like that right after saying nigga, nigga, fuck, fuck, wee, wee, wee. I said I just embrace racism. He just looked at me like what the fuck do you mean you embrace racism. I was like no, it’s here. This thing is like we’re in a jail cell. Are we gonna keep fighting this? How do we just embrace what’s in front of us as opposed to always pinpointing that it’s the reason you’re being held back? But I realised in order to truly be one of the greatest artists and one of the most remembered artists - I’ma get off the social subject and switch it more into the art and fashion context again - is that same assistance that I begged for and got frustrated for… The fact that I’m starting to do it without some of that assistance is what makes it truly historical and what demands the respect. And that’s the reason why even in the beginning, there’s like an intellectual olive branch of your show had more meaning than just being an oversized sweatshirt. I refused that intellectual… Get that fucking branch out of my face. I ain’t gonna take it. I ain’t gonna take the meaning that you proposed upon me. This is what i meant and if it’s not good enough for you, then fuck you. My Aunt, one time, she let me see Robocop and my Dad was really strict and I came home and was about to tell him and she grabbed me and said, ‘You’re really a glutton for punishment, aren’t you?’ Almost like a masochist or some shit, right. And like in a way, I am. I kinda like pain, I like the challenge, I like making things harder for yourself because if you can beat the game on the hardest mode possible, you’ll be the best of all time. So that means if I become a good designer as a black straight American entertainer, rich dude, all the type of shit that says you shouldn’t be able to have any creative thoughts, then it’s like the ultimate fucking win. Then you’re like Eminem or Tiger Woods or Barack Obama, just someone who just completely broke all boundaries... And it’s exciting. This interview is exciting because it’s such a battle of perception and a battle of the intellects and a battle of culture and a battle of class, a battle of taste. It’s like y’all motherfuckers know I’m gonna win this battle. It’s so fun though. It’s so fun. Because the whole trick I always say is I’m an artist and an artist can basically take on any shape, form and an artist can paint anything. So when I’m like opening up the Yeezus mountain on tour and stuff with the Margiela mask… you know, some nights in the middle of one of my rants, I’m just like I’m sorry, the gig is up. I was actually never really a rapper, I was always an artist and that’s the reason why I’m just killing this shit so hard right now. So when you talk to the lighting guys, it might not come out as good but don’t feel bad because I’ve been trained since age 5 and went to college for this shit. It’s always like that secret thing, you know. It’s about sharing information. Jews are a culture that share information. That does not happen in the black community. For your family, your son, maybe. Day one, this is how this community works. This is how we grow together. And that racism, slave mentality, nigga mentality, show off mentality, I’ma fuck your bitch mentality, all that is like what makes a culture that has all the highest physical attributes going for it the weakest due to simply - like that speech DiCaprio gave on Django - simply removing the esteem and that is why I refuse to fucking back down. You have to know that you are somebody. You have to know that it’s possible whether you’re creative, whether you’re a black person in America, whether you’re a black person in London, you know, you have to know it’s possible. You have to see me keep winning against all odds. I will win until I die. I won’t lose. I can’t lose because then it’s like they win; ‘they’ meaning the mentality, the old guard of thought because we’re just a thought. A hundred years from now, we’re all just memories.

LS: Do you feel it’s true all creatives die alone due to lack of understanding? In some ways, what you’re saying, you sound super positive but in other ways, there is that sense of pessimism and people not understanding. Do you think that statement’s true?

KW: Well, I’ve said a bunch of wild shit and my wife hasn’t left me yet so let’s hope not. But I think there will be someone who will understand everyone. I don't know. Maybe there is a someone for everyone. I’m trying to be overly positive.

LS: I can’t really think of anything profound that I don’t already know about you… so here’s a really simple question that I actually don’t know. What would your last meal be? (Kim Kardashian West)

KW: Oh it’d definitely be some of of her home cooked fried chicken.

LS: Going back to the women thing, it’s a question I want to know. Would you say you’re a feminist?

KW: I think I’m a humanist. Is that a party? But yeah, come on, like so many black kids in America, I was raised majority by my Mum. My Dad was around - I would see him in the summers and the springtime. But I think I fight for the importance of any community that is not being properly accredited - just period - of anything. This statement is going to sound kinda gay but I’m gonna say it. I love older white men, but basically if you’re not an older white man, you don’t run shit. It’s always gonna be more of a fight for anyone that isn’t an older white man. Period. So I like to speak on behalf of people without a voice and sometimes that could be a creative, sometimes that could be a woman, sometimes that could be a man turned into a woman. My dad five years ago would live in a homeless shelter to counsel with ex-drug addicts and, you know, he really cares about people. It’s like as soon as he moved to where he is now, he was like how can we improve the water here? How can we improve the education system? I just met this girl. She’s in this situation with her family. This and that. What can we do to improve this? That’s all he cared about. It’s caring about people. So there’s something where it’s like I live my life, I get to be a rockstar, a rapper, this, that, and then at a certain point, it’s at that moment where you just look and you see people dying and being on top of their roof and you just look at the camera and say George Bush doesn’t care about… and that’s like my dad and that’s my mum. I’ll go to a football game and I’ll be looking at the game and I’ll watch the score and I look at the human score meaning like the 50,000 people there and I start to zone in and think like where did this person come from? What did they go through? What type of job have they got? What brought us all here today? What are their interests? It’s like sometimes that part of my dad comes out of me that starts to get really intrigued with who people are. So even when I design, I am going to make the Apple of clothing. I don’t think there’s a purpose of saying you want to do it because it’s obvious I want to… But want is like this politically correct way to word your future accomplishments. This one guy was super snobby with me at a fashion dinner, of course. And I explained to him that there was a time when people said I couldn’t rap and he asked me, ‘Oh, so is this what you hope to do in clothing?’ I was like I don’t hope. I execute. As far as apparel goes, I will make the Apple of apparel and the Apple of apparel isn’t high street. It isn’t fast fashion. It isn’t a $9000 sweatshirt. It’s the thing you want to keep for the rest of your life. Just looking at human beings, sometimes you present things, people don’t even know that they want it yet. I could show you two photographs. I’ll show you a really well-known designer that’s highly respected blah blah blah that I pulled as a reference to proportion because they had this silk jacket. It almost looked like a lining fabric. If I describe it too well, they’ll know what I’m talking about. I don’t want to say the person’s name but it had like denim on denim and like a sock on a shoe and different things like that. It was after I did my sock shoe. And I had a photo I had just done and the guy had an olive jacket on, cotton on cotton, self-lined, a tank top… The colour, I probably couldn’t even describe it, almost an orange but really subtle, and the shorts are like some beautiful light brown with a bit of grey in it and the guy was black that the clothes were on. And everyone who I showed those two images together, now, the one image, you even know who the designer is and it’s top five designers in the game and you see this image right here. And I’m like which one? And people always pick this one because of the colours and people don’t even understand how important colour is as an opinion in clothing. Give a fuck if I got any of the cuts right on the last collection. Anyone who doesn’t say ‘I had an emotional connection to the colour palette’, they don’t even know how to see anymore. They don’t even know what they’re looking at. They see clothes and they’re looking at numbers. They’re not feeling emotion. They’re thinking about trend. They’re not seeing future. They’re not seeing luxury. They’re not seeing time like oh shit, I wanna go to the park with my family. I’ll just throw this on. That’s what I want to do: is present something that gives people some of their time back because it works together like Lego and you just throw it on. And I’m not saying that I mastered it by season 2 for Christ’s sake. I didn’t hit ‘Watch the Throne’ and ‘Dark Fantasy’ on my second mixtape. But the theory is there and only I can do it. Only i care about it that much. Only i have the exact 2 and 3 code in my head. I could say it out loud. I could say oh this army surplus but look at how far we jumped from army surplus in the second season. So just think about where we’ll be by season 3. Look at how far we jumped. Cause I have the code in my head. You have to cut open my head and take my brain and put it on top of some big organisation and you can’t. It’s like completely, you know, that sweatshirt, that T-shirt decision I’m making is a piece of my mum having me at Operation Push at age five, it’s a piece of my dad going to the homeless shelter, it’s a piece of my grandfather having a store where he fixed furniture in the back, it’s a piece of my cousin bootlegging cross colours out in LA, it’s a piece of my Aunt that was the chicest woman that I knew. Even when she had Alzheimers, she would dress better than the entire family and I remember the colours and they remind me of the colours that we were able to find. We were able to start to find and penetrate this concept by the second season without being held back by the fabrics that were available, to do all-black and only have a navy blah blah blah. I don’t use blue. It bugs me out.

LS: Tell me about the colour blue.

KW: Yeah, I hate the colour blue. On this collection, Katherine Hamnett was emailing me about how I had to have blue jeans and how I’d need to have a white shirt and this and that about… I was like I guess I could see how I would need that but like I said, I like to make it harder for myself by just doing what I want to do.

LS: You say you like to make things hard for yourself and you’re so driven and you’re so passionate. You’re obviously ambitious. Are you happy?

KW: So so so so happy. And I’m happy for the normal reasons to be happy because I married the woman of my dreams and I have a beautiful daughter and so many beautiful people around me and my cousins and families in different states - there’s so many loving people. I have a son on the way. I have a lot of life ahead of me and I have the opportunity to be completely rogue and to be able to support myself being who I am exactly and now I’ve even opened up a whole new place to create by being able to do apparel and then going in and doing film and being able to take those horses that at one point were pulling in all these different directions and pulling my arms out of my sockets and re-aim them in one direction and have the most powerful four horses running towards you; that tsunami about to hit, that earthquake about to come in. Some people might not see it and for the people who don’t see it and don’t understand what’s about to happen, you know, certain people are visionaries, certain people are early adopters, certain people are just followers. So I take it that the most negative reaction is from the followers.

[Verse 1]
Her blood was red, but now it's blue
She no longer smiles at you
Her lipstick’s black and she no longer smiles at all
Her lipstick’s black and she no longer smiles at all

Because its true she's a gangster with her emotion
A capitalist with her affection
As she swindles away
As she swindles away to your heart
Oh doll

[Chorus]
She'll tear it apart (she'll tear it apart)
She'll tear it apart (she'll tear it, she'll tear it apart)
She'll tear it apart (she'll tear it apart)
She'll tear it apart

[Verse 2]
Her lipstick’s black and she no longer smiles at all
Her lipstick’s black and she no longer smiles at all
Because its true she's a gangster with her emotion
A capitalist with her affection
As she swindles away
As she swindles away to your heart
Oh doll

[Chorus]
She'll tear it apart (she'll tear it apart)
She'll tear it apart (she'll tear it, she'll tear it apart)
She'll tear it apart (she'll tear it apart)
She'll tear it apart

[Verse 1]
I know something you don't know
Trouble coming to your home
Wake up and you're all alone
I know something you don't know

[Verse 2]
I know why you're on the phone
Late night when you're feeling low
I know why you're in the mud
I know why it's in your blood
I know who your master is
I know when he calls it quits
You'll be in a Chinese restaurant
Over rice with the mud still dripping out

[Verse 3]
I know something you don't know
Trouble coming to your home
Wake up and you're all alone
I know something you don't know
If you listen and don't shout you can hear the way she feels
If you squint you can make out the sliding little pills
And if you mothafuckers don't like it you can all get out

And the gods still go sideways
Or at least it seems like that these days
And if you mothafuckers don't like it you can all get out

O dharma, they charmed her, never fall
God, to the pure is cruelest of all
O dharma, she'll never fall
She should believe in karma
And maybe that's not all

When you know you're like that
And you just can't help yourself
When your feet walk back
And crush the flowers in the earth
When your love turns black
And everything looks grey
When your life goes back
And you've got nothing left to say

[Verse 1]
She doesn't call before midnight, if at all
Oh, she never stays to watch the night turn to day

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm like use me baby, anyway you want
I wish you were mine in the broad daylight
But you just use me baby, anyway you want
I wish you were mine but

[Chorus]
She only loves me when the lights are off, lights are off
She only loves me when the sun is down, sun is down
She only loves me when no one's around, one's around
She only loves me cause I put it down
And it's fine by me
And it's fine by me

[Verse 2]
She's like the wind, she comes and goes and again
All of my friends think I'm a fool, silly them

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm like use me baby, anyway you want
I wish you were mine in the broad daylight
But you just use me baby, anyway you want
I wish you were mine but

[Chorus]
She only loves me when the lights are off, lights are off
She only loves me when the sun is down, sun is down
She only loves me when no one's around, one's around
She only loves me cause I put it down
And it's fine by me
And it's fine by me

[Bridge]
She knows I can take her there, afterwards she just don't care
She knows I can take her there, afterwards she just don't care

[Chorus]
She only loves me when the lights are off, lights are off
She only loves me when the sun is down, sun is down
She only loves me when no one's around, one's around
She only loves me cause I put it down
You a freak, and it's fine by me
You a freak, and it's fine by me
And it's fine by me
And it's fine by me
And it's fine by me

[Enchanted]
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
That this night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

[Wildest Dreams]
He said let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds
I thought heaven can't help me now
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna take me down
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
He said no one has to know what we do
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever
But this is getting good now
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
Ooh

[Enchanted]
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go, don't you let it go
This night is flawless
Don't you let it go, don't you let it go
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go, don't you let it go
This night is flawless
Don't you let it go

[Wildest Dreams]
You'll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories follow you around (follow you around)
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again, even if it's just pretend
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe

[Verse 1]
I started thinking I got something to prove
You tried to tell me we had nothing to lose
Cause when we danced together, we were one pair of shoes
Cause you're my babylon, babylon
Now I'm living just to live out regret
And I know this love will die if I let it
But what you gave to me I swore I'd never forget it
Cause you're my babylon, babylon

[Pre-Chorus]
With you, I'm running wild
With you, the city comes alive
With you, we'll set it all on fire
Cause you're my babylon, babylon

[Chorus]
So won't you take me back
Back where we were covered in champagne
And everybody thought we were insane
Where you will always be my babylon, my babylon
So won't you take me back
Back to where I knew you would save me
Where everyone else thought I was crazy
Where you would always be my babylon, my babylon
(Where you would always be my babylon, my babylon)

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry girl, I had to stop for a second
Catch my breath so I would stop second guessing
And when we danced together, yeah you taught me a lesson
Cause you're my babylon, babylon

[Pre-Chorus]
With you, I'm running wild
With you, the city comes alive
With you, we'll set it all on fire
Cause you're my babylon, babylon

[Chorus]
So won't you take me back
Back where we were covered in champagne
And everybody thought we were insane
Where you will always be my babylon, my babylon
So won't you take me back
Back to where I knew you would save me
Where everyone once thought I was crazy
Where you would always be my babylon, my babylon

[Outro]
My babylon, my babylon
My babylon, my babylon
My babylon, my babylon
My babylon, my babylon
My babylon, my babylon

Waiting here patiently for you to say that
You sent him on his way, you sent him on his way
And I know you're worried, been tossing and turning
It's keeping you awake, thinking it was a mistake

[Verse 1]
I guess it's time that I run far away
I recognise all the things that's being said
I'm leaving this now

I try to find a piece of pleasure in pain
I try to find the sun in the rain
I'm leaving this now
I'm leaving this now

[Chorus]
Where I'm 'bout to go, the lights all glow
And there's no rejection, all I see is hope

Where I'm 'bout to go, the lights all glow
And there's no rejection, all I see is hope
My promised land
My promised land

[Verse 2]
I'm feeling at home, so I'll be gone for a while
And these streets, they allude me with a smile
I'm home again
I'm home again
I'm ready to do the things I've never done
I'm ready to show the world that I've won
I'm home again
I'm home again

[Chorus]
Where I'm 'bout to go, the lights all glow
And there's no rejection, all I see is hope
My promised land
My promised land
Where I'm 'bout to go, the lights all glow
And there's no rejection, all I see is hope
My promised land
My promised land
My promised land
My promised land

[Bridge - OMI]
It's like a millennium countdown
For the New Year to come around

We'll say 5 4 3 2 1

[Verse 1]
On the back streets of JA, think I made it through another day
Think I'll give it another shot to get you out of my head
And the angels rescue me, save my sorrows for another day
Think I'll give it another shot to forget all of our miseries

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna drink the night away, away, away, away
If you wanna drink the night away, save my sorrows for another day

[Chorus]
Cause I never met no one like you, so beautiful
Girl I never met no one like you, so beautiful
The way you look at me, I know it's real
Girl I never met no one like you, so beautiful, so beautiful

[Verse 2]
On the back streets of LA, you asked me for a cigarette
I'm off my feet yeah, tell me do you feel the same?

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna drink the night away, away, away, away
If you wanna drink the night away, away, save your sorrows for another day

[Chorus]
Cause I never met no one like you, so beautiful
Girl I never met no one like you, so beautiful

Girl I never met no one like you, so beautiful, so beautiful

[Outro]
I never met no one like you, so beautiful, ooh
Oh yes, I said I never met no one like you, so beautiful, so beautiful

[Verse 1]
All my life I spent chasing the pretty lights
And how they shine, but they never kept me warm
How many times did I once let love come and go?
Was it my pride that made me run so far?

[Pre-Chorus]
Was it your voice that called me when I was at my low?
Was it your love that warmed me? I guess tonight I'll know

[Chorus]
'Cause in my heart, I was a hitchhiker 'til I found you
I found a home I never wanna leave
'Cause in my heart, I was a hitchhiker this what I choose
I found a home I never wanna leave
I was a hitchhiker, I was a hitchhiker 'til I found you
I was a hitchhiker

[Verse 2]
Am I too messed up or is there time for me to change?
Where was my love when I needed it the most?
But then you showed up, for the first time you heard me say
"Can I stay? Can I stay a little longer with you?"

[Pre-Chorus]
Was it your voice that called me when I was at my low?
Was it your love that warmed me? I guess tonight I'll know

[Chorus]
'Cause in my heart, I was a hitchhiker 'til I found you
I found a home I never wanna leave
'Cause in my heart, I was a hitchhiker this what I choose
I found a home I never wanna leave
I was a hitchhiker 'til I found you
I was a hitchhiker

[Pre-Chorus]
Was it your voice that called me when I was at my low?
Was it your love that warmed me? I guess tonight I'll know

[Chorus]
'Cause in my heart, I was a hitchhiker 'til I found you
I found a home I never wanna leave
'Cause in my heart, I was a hitchhiker this what I choose
I found a home I never wanna leave
'Cause in my heart, I was a hitchhiker 'til I found you
I found a home I never wanna leave
'Cause in my heart, I was a hitchhiker this what I choose
I found a home I never wanna leave
I was a hitchhiker
Love yeah yeah
Sing it girl

[Verse 1]
I've got a man with the heart of a giant
And I couldn't ask for more
He makes me feel like a beautiful woman
So glad he's mine, I'll never let him go
I spend my days tryna hold things together
I pay the bills on time
And I give my all cause I know she deserves it
She couldn't be better for me, no no

[Chorus]
Even if we didn't have no money
Or the world went upside-down
What if we were millionaires
It's always gonna be me for you, for me
It's always gonna be me for you, for me

[Verse 2]
I love waking up to his face every morning
And hold him when we fall asleep
And she looks the best in the dress that I gave her
She wears it just for me

[Chorus]
Even if we didn't have no money
Or the world went upside-down
What if we were millionaires
It's always gonna be me for you, for me
It's always gonna be me for you, for me
Even if we didn't have no money
Or the world went upside-down
What if we were millionaires
It's always gonna be me for you, for me
Even if we didn't have no money
Or the world went upside-down
What if we were millionaires
It's always gonna be me for you, for me
It's always gonna be me for you, for me
It's always gonna be me for you, for me
It's always gonna be me for you, for me
It's always gonna be me for you, for me

[Verse 1]
People always say that the world today is a crazy place
Cause all the things that made a lot of sense took a holiday
Like you and me and the love we shared
And the kisses and hugs that you can't compare
But I'm tryna write you a beautiful song
But it's hard to find the words to say

[Chorus]
Oh, sing it out loud, oh yeah
Sing it out loud, yeah yeah yeah
Put your lighters in the air
And keep them up until the shadows disappear, oh yeah
Until the clouds fall back into place
And the words jump back on this page
Until the world makes sense again

[Verse 2]
You don't have to say what you're about to say, I've heard it so many times
That it won't work cause we don't know unless we try
Nothing good comes easy and baby easy won't last, oh
Tryna write you a beautiful song
But my vocabulary ain't that wast

[Chorus]
Oh, sing it out loud, oh yeah
Sing it out loud, yeah yeah yeah
Put your lighters in the air
And keep them up until the shadows disappear, oh yeah
Until the clouds fall back into place, yeah
And the words jump back on this page
And the world makes sense again
Sing it out loud, oh yeah
Sing it out loud, yeah yeah yeah
Put your lighters in the air
And keep them up until the shadows disappear, oh yeah
Until the clouds fall back into place

[Verse: Nicki Minaj]
Think you better than me? Top me then
I'm Nicki Minaj looking for some bobbsey twins
Bitches know that I be flyer than the turbulence
Favorite colors pink and purple and feds circling
Anyway, I'm overseas on vacation, girls
Sitting in the VIP with some geisha girls, oh
Excuse me busta, light your dutch up
I'm the mustard, time to ketchup
Fuck around then catch a couple slugs to your Yaki
Get me my collard greens my chicken teriyaki
I get the club j-j-j-j-j-jump, jumping
Can't tell me nothing, couldn’t even tell me something
Icy, icy, icy hot and matter fact I know a real nice pricey spot
I'm 'bout to get me everything Ice mic could cop
Red underneath the shoes, no nike shox

[Spoken Word]
You know, when I went out to Ohio, there was like a mini riot
And, you know, we thought it was, like, Michael Jackson, you know?
So we was just looking for the gloves and the two little white kids with the silk wrapped around they face
You know, 'cause the people were just going crazy
They was screaming and, you know, yelling
And I turn around...

[Verse 1: Jake]
I could take you on a rooftop, baby
Where you been lately?
Where you been lately?
Cut my ears off and call me a child
Waiting all the while
Waiting all the while for you

[Chorus]
St. Paul roofs
St. Paul roofs
St. Paul roofs

[Verse 2: Jake]
All the way from Minnesota to New York
Where we got started
Where you dues imparted upon mine
Your letters filled heart-shaped caverns
Black ink and  lanterns
With our whisky tantrums

[Pre-Chorus: Jake]
Smoke from cigarettes
And bitter drinks that cloud the
Tiny scent of home

[Chorus]
St. Paul roofs
St. Paul roofs
St. Paul roofs

[Bridge: Jake]
Tell me friend
Are you content
With how it has to be?
Halocline
Your hand in mine
A purpose here I see
Oh, faceless crowds and tall buildings keep you thinking, oh
About St. Paul winters, never keen on leaving you, oh

[Chorus]
St. Paul roofs
St. Paul roofs
St. Paul roofs
St. Paul

[Bridge 2]
I could take you on a rooftop, baby (St. Paul roofs)
I could take you on a rooftop, baby (St. Paul roofs)
I could take you on a rooftop, baby (St. Paul roofs)
I could take you on a rooftop, baby

[Chorus]
St. Paul roofs
St. Paul roofs
St. Paul roofs

Get to the end zone, jerk it out, now work it out

Stay positive and give back to the kids in the neighborhood
From Poly High, off the eastside to the Philadelphia Eagles flying real high
Doing good, living well

On the ??, hard as ??
And we will never ever ever ever ??
So hit us up

Fourth track of their Carnival Ep, first played by

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Said you want a little company
And I love it, 'cause the thrill's cheap
Said you left him for good this time
Still, if he knew I was here, he'd wanna kill me
(Kill me)
But it's time you met the real me, filthy
But wasn't always, will be
Your pill refill and I'll still be your addiction
You can touch a prescription, but don't fill me
I let you see my dark side
But like a mic check, you got one too
So when the sparks fly
We hit the flight deck and got sprung (Pew!)
Like an ejector seat from an F-15
But tonight, we don't need those pills
Just the effects of each other, but we gon' film
'Cause I will want your ex to see (Get it?)
That...

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only fuck you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

[Verse 2: Eminem]
And every time he hurt you, I heard you
Your shoulder to cry on
And I'll be damned if I weren't who you turned to
You said he drove you to my arms
But don't you know (Don't you know)
Remember when I told you (Told you)
I would never let down my guard?
And I hope you (Hope you)
Feel like dirt when I hold you (Hold you)
'Cause is it really over?
But you just want a little company
And you just really wanna thrill-seek
Said you left him for good this time
Bullshit, what your friends do, spill beans?
Or you just wanna be guilt free, and still creep
But these hills see from their POV, we can touch
But the only way you'll film me is with a camera, feel me?
You're nothin' but a barfly
You got your sights set on the one who you run to
But I'm a far cry from what you might get, if we come true
So keep textin' me
But at night, if you seek those thrills, what I expect to be?
'Cause if you cheat on him
Just means I will be the next to be your ex
So no complexities, just sex
And don't lecture me, just accept that...

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only fuck you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

[Bridge: The Weeknd]
Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes
Who are you to judge? Who are you to judge?
Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies
Only you to trust, only you

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only fuck you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

Catch her ? catch her in decatur

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Remember that time I showed up with just panties under my coat?
High heels, they was knee high, and my legs was grippin' that throat
You told me this and I quote, 'cause we popped pills and you smoked
You said, "Your stuff got me strung out, it's like doin' lines of some coke"
You always say it's the best that you ever had in your life
And you always play with it good when we be speedin' off in that Wraith
Just keep coppin' them things that you be coppin' me on the eighth
You the president and I'm Biden, just slide in cause you safe, nigga, third base

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
I'ma let you know and keep it simple
Tryna keep it up don't seem so simple
I just fucked two bitches 'fore I saw you
And you gon' have to do it at my tempo
Always tryna send me off to rehab
Drugs started feelin' like it's decaf
I'm just tryna live life for the moment
And all these motherfuckers want a relapse

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

[Bridge: The Weeknd]
Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes
Who are you to judge, who are you to judge?
Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies
Only you to trust, only you

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side

[Verse 1]
Do you think I'd sacrifice a real life
For all the fame and flashing lights?
Do you think I'd sacrifice a real life
For all the fame and flashing lights?
There is no Gucci I can buy
There is no Louis Vuitton to put on
There is no YSL that they could sell
To take my mind out of this jail
And my heart out of this hell
There are no clothes that I could buy
That could turn back in time
There is no vacation spot I could fly
That could bring back a piece of real life, real life
I ask you tonight: what does it feel like?
What does it feel like
I ask you tonight: what does it feel like to live a real life?

[Chorus]
I just wanna be a real boy
Pinocchio's story goes to be a real boy
Pinocchio's story goes to be a real boy
I just wanna be a real boy

[Verse 2]
The funny thing is
Pinocchio lied, and that's what kept him from it
I tell the truth and I-I keep running
It's like I'm looking out there, tryna find something
I looked on the TV and I see me and see nothing
So what does it feel like to live real life, to be real
Not some facade that no one can really feel
Do you really have the stamina?
For everybody that sees you that say: "wait a second, where's my camera?"
For everybody that sees you to say: "can you sign an autograph"
For everybody that sees you cryin' that say you oughta laugh
You oughta laugh
There is no Gucci I can buy
There is no Louis Vuitton to put on
There is no vacation spot that I could fly
That could bring back a piece of real life
Real life, real life
Real life, real life

[Verse 3 (freestyle)]
Don't miss, don't miss—
The camera's on, you gotta do it like, this—
And move your other leg like, this—
And uh, don't get nobody pissed
Aye nigga, aye nigga don't miss!
Everyday's the Super Bowl—
You better not miss!
Everyday is the playoffs or the championship, aye
Nigga don't miss!
Because uh—
If you miss one step we gon', we gon' treat you like this
We gon' talk shit about you like this
We gon' beat you up like this
We gon' say that people don't like you
We gon' try to make the whole world hate you
Don't tell, don't never say what everybody else is thinking
Nigga, nigga, nigga don't miss—
Walk perfectly in this town
And I feel down again, when I'm down again
And I'm down again
Can you imagine how many times they told me
That I would never work in this town again?
In this town again
And I felt down again, and I felt down again
And I felt down again, do you get it?
Can you imagine how many times they told me
I'd never work in this town again?
But now two nights at the Hollywood Bowl sold out!
Aye, don't let 'em bring you down, on't let 'em bring you down, down
It's more ways than they way to do it
And I'm here to prove it
I'm here to prove it, I'm here to prove it
I'm here to prove it
Nigga don't miss, nigga don't miss
Walk like this, do it like this
Don't get nobody pissed
Walk like this, or we gon' beat you
Aye, aye, aye, aye
And they told me, told me
For 6 years that ain't nobody love me
And they told me, they told me
You better not show your face in public boy
They told me
Better stand still Emmett Till, better stand still Emmett Till
They told me, they told me, they told me
(They told me, they told me, they told me, they told me)
Like Pinocchio they must have lied
'Cause I feel so much love tonight
They must have lied 'cause I feel so much love tonight
Oh, they must have lied 'cause I feel so much love tonight
They must have lied 'cause I feel so much love tonight
They must have lied, lied

How I'm still alive, It's like a miracle
You young black and you 25
Cause this is where they die
I'm only 20 now my people screaming get a job
They steady asking what's my goals I tell them to survive
Cause it's real in the fields murder homicide

People feel my pain from the soul that's inside of me
Honestly, I've walked through a life full of rain

Separation what I deciding to do, but I've been riding since two
Since a youngin' hold it down on my own

And still hold it down on the throne, feel me
South Phil where it's real in the zone so filthy
Pain, critically acclaimed, nigga in the game, it's still blood gang
People feel my pain but it's strange but I'm focused
I see clear vision as I'm scoping my set ears open
Faithfully I'm praying and I'm hoping
Before my man that's going well love and my condolences
I noticed that's it's pure love from the heart and soul

[Verse: Kanye West]
I caught a wave
Caught more air than Super Dave
Call Aaliyah, I'm super paid
Jet lag, and tryna recuperate
Just got off the flight from Budapest
Don't need Khaled, to say "you the best!"
You the type of nigga to shop at Uniqlo
Just found out my father-in-law unisex
Running out of money, running into debt
Running from bill collectors, I ain't pay them yet
Shit you did, with no matter how rich you get
And even more, depending on the bitch you get
I be getting worried for my niggas getting married, seriously

[Verse: Kanye West]
And if I can’t marry you, listen up, I done came this way
Nah baby, not for them, you all know this way...

[Hook]
And you a snitch, and you a rat
Ya you a bitch, ya it's a fact
That you a, and you a, and you a
Rat, rat, rat
And you a, and you a, and you a
Rat, rat, rat

[Verse 1]
I've been in the hood trapping all day hugging the strip
Ducking the ditch you in the crib hugging your bitch
I'm in the hood with it, good with it stuck in the mix
Breakfast time we at the kitchen with it bubbling grits
Scrambling eggs cause we be packing hammers for days
Lemon squeezer for the matics and banana for K's
We wig splitters we ain't aiming at legs
Head shots fuck up your hair line and damage your waves
Filling your fade have blood dripping all on your shit
Put your hommie in a hole like he just fucked up a brick
Nothing you did so nothing to spit
Same niggas hating on me I be fucking their bitch
Cause they really lame
Talking like they hard core but they really 

[?]
But I control them like controllers when that milli flame

[Hook]
And you a snitch, and you a rat
Ya you a bitch, ya it's a fact
That you a, and you a, and you a
Rat, rat, rat
And you a, and you a, and you a
Rat, rat, rat

[Verse 2]
I be up in the hood, Glock tre pound
Graveyard shifting, holding the block down
Me and my niggas, don't make a sound
Them pussies spin through and we gon' spin them back around
With some big boy shit to wake the neighbors up
Out on bail but I'm armed and dangerous
With some heat up in my tool we call it flames 

[?]
Ready to wet a nigga ass like some angel dust
Cause these niggas be tripping, thinking that you slipping
Finger on the trigger I ain't blinking my nigga
Somebody move I start ringing on niggas
With no hesitation I be banging on niggas
Like the operator
You toss them here we toss them back like it's hot potato
Man you ain't you'se a rat a cooperator
We got an oozi with a ladder called the whoopinater
And got a 50 it it, my man getting busy with it
And he be squeezing like a lemon with it

[Hook]
And you a snitch, and you a rat
Ya you a bitch, ya it's a fact
That you a, and you a, and you a
Rat, rat, rat
And you a, and you a, and you a
Rat, rat, rat

[Verse 3]
Now you got these niggas at the precent, telling like it's decent
Snitching on a Monday get you buried by the weekend
Leaking, funeral 

[?] preachers

[?] rest in peacing
Can't do the time, then don't do the crime
Facing 20 years but turned out 2 to 5
Talking to them people you even told them lies
You wasn't even there you snitching on a homicide
Got that man all booked up like a library
He coming home like 2060 neveruary
We all breath, my niggas all squeeze
I heard them niggas catching wreck but shit we all bleed
I slide up on them with that mac I bet they all freeze
Soon as them shots fly smoke 'em like a 

[?]
Meek Milly ain't in your top 5
Niggas get that shit it in 'em start thinking that they

Trying to show off, nigga think he so hard
Catching him slipping do him dirty like they did Omar
Glock banging on him sideways like O-dawg
Hit him in his head he dead

Cause you a rat

[Intro: Curly Fryz]
That’s why I never let a man pick out my clothes

[Verse 1: Prince]
Roll up in the town early afternoon (hey hey hey)
Looking for the pimp dress that'll make you swoon (hey hey hey)
Found a little number and a fancy brassiere (hey hey hey)
Lookin' like a mack all up in here (lookin' like a mack all up in here)

[Chorus: Prince]
Whole block lookin' and the girls are hot
Pick one come and show me what you got
Everything or nothing if you want a lot of what's cookin'
She's lookin', lookin', lookin', lookin', lookin' like a mack, like a mack

[Verse 2: Curly Fryz]
Whatcha lookin' at me? Oh!
Step in lookin' like who? Whoa!
Drop it down then I pick it up slow
We run the town, city, states and the globe
Tryin' holla, I’m like, “What? No!”
Plus he lookin' like eww, gross!
I’m on the wave can you keep up with my flow
My music bang, you can feel it in your soul

[Verse 3: Curly Fryz]
And I rolled up in the town early afternoon
On the block lookin' hot like it's early June
At the top shinin' bright something like the moon
Can you picture with my lyrics bumpin' my cartoons
With my ace cause we're queens so we never get carded
Kill the scene then we leave call it “dearly departed”
Tryin' to dip but we can't cause we getting bombarded
You already know we coming the hardest

[Chorus: Curly Fryz]
Cam light flashing and my click is hot
Pick one and come and show me what you got
Everything or nothing if you wanna a lot of what's cookin
‘Cause she’s lookin', lookin', lookin', lookin', lookin', aw

[Verse 4: Prince]
Look at little Willy walking down this way
Only bring a blonde on a good day
Not another autograph, cue the DJ
Everybody dance when I say
Whole block crushing and the girls are hot
Dancin' with each other cause the boys are not
Tryin' to trade numbers for the drinks they bought
But, whatcha supposed to think in a club full of thots

[Chorus; Prince]
Pro black fashion and the girls are hot
Pick one, come and show me what you got
Everything or nothing if you wanna a lot of what's cookin'
Cause she's lookin', lookin', lookin', lookin', lookin', like a mack

[Bridge: Curly Fryz]
Here’s my crew dressed in all black like we mobbin'
Pockets got the mumps so you know we never starvin'
Noddin' and bobbin' our heads to the beat
You see how we rockin' shows, go and get up out your seats
Life is like a movie when we step upon the stage
I got fifty different styles that I got up on display
We gon' make the party jump so you know we're here to stay
Stackin' paper up while y'all on the same page, come on

[Chorus: Curly Fryz]
Cam light flashin’ ‘and my click is hot (hey)
Pick one and come and show me what you got (come on)
Everything or nothing if you wanna a lot of what’s cookin’
‘Cause she’s lookin’, lookin’, lookin’, lookin’, lookin’, aw

[Outro: Prince]
Tryin' to trade numbers for the drinks they bought (hey hey hey)
Drinks they bought, dri-drinks they bought (hey hey hey)
Club on a, club on a, club on a
Hey hey hey, hey hey hey
Club on a, club on a, club on a
She's lookin', lookin', lookin', lookin', lookin', lookin', like a mack

[Instrumental outro]

Lookin', lookin', lookin', lookin', lookin'

[Verse 1]
A few months ago or maybe it was years
It was a heartbreak and so many tears
How she gonna make it out here on her own
A body like that should never be alone
A kiss on the stairway, another man’s embrace
How was she to know, just what was taking place?
Too busy with the jugular and how it taste
To remember what she saw in the X's face

[Chorus]
The X's face
The X's face

[Verse 2]
Long time ago or maybe yesterday
You and I in chariots, on our way
Purple celebration for what we've learned
But for every battle won, there are scars and burns
For every broken heart, there's another will mend
Who needs enemies when you got friends
For every open door there's something in the way
Last time we checked it was the X's face

[Chorus]
The X's face
The X's face

[Outro]
Everybody know about the X's face
Black don't crack
Beige don't age
Go and take that banana
Then get back in your cage
Oh Lord
Ooh ooh ah hah ah ah
The X's face
Go and take that banana, take it
The X's face
Get it, I said you could have it
Oh no
The X's face
Why
Would I lie
This thing
It haunts me like a shadow
Never lets me go
He was cross
I knew how lost
I knew my way
Oh, how I played him

Dance
Dirty man
You dance
Find what you've been missing
Between the thorn and you
Twist until you're itching
Beg me to come through
Out he goes
Part of a whole
Puppet of mine
Where will they find me?

[Verse 1]
Into my big cloud
I'm flying all the time
I'm happy
Into your bedroom
I'm watching your backside
I'm trying
Out through my window
I'm deeper all the time

[Refrain]
Did you hear what I said?
I got salt in my head
Did you hear what I said?
I got salt in my head

[Verse 2]
Don’t make me hurt you
I'm watching you from here
I'm happy
Eyeing and tapping
A wrecking ball of fear
I'm lying
Don’t take me with you
I'm happy where I am

[Outro]
Today I washed my hands
I want to be alone
I want to fry
Today I washed my hands
I want to be alone
I want to fry
Today I washed my hands
I want to be alone
I want to fry
Today I washed my hands
I want to be alone
I want

[Verse]
Bright boy, I can help you
If you let me take your hand
Bring you right to promise land
Bring you right to promise
Bright boy, I could love you
If you let me be your wife
Love you so for all my life
Love you so for all my
Waiting by the water
You return with eyes cast down
Bright boy, what has made you frown?
Bright boy, what has made you
Waiting by the water
Sun is setting on the sea
Bright boy, please return to me
Bright boy, please return to
Say what you will
Well I know what I am
Uncertain at best
Foolish until
I came to
On an evening with you
Is it living a lie
Certain

I'm sitting in love
Talking in love
Waiting in love

Well I won't rock the boat
I don't buy just to sell
I swallow my pride
Running to
You are my moon
I will follow you down
Down Darby Creek crying
I'm running in love
Losing in love
Scratching in love
Wired in love
On your street
In your pause between sentences
I can tell what's hanging around
In your drawer
Roll around on the kitchen floor
I know what's been gettin' to you

Well, do you have it tonight?
"I dunno
I can't find it..."
Well, are you ready tonight?
"I dunno
But I'll try."

She came right through me

All worked up
Let back down by a memory
A word you said meant something to me
Chewin' gum
Killin' time till the morning comes
You could stay, or maybe you'll leave
Doesn't make a difference to me
(cough)

She came right through me
If I could look past it I'd be
Big and free
What I'd be
If I could run faster I'd be
You know where I'd be
You know where I'd be
If I could think harder I'd see
More than me
I can't see
If I could run faster I'd be
You know where I'd be

Life was easy for a dog like me
I ran faster than anybody
Through the bushes into the store
Liquor cabinet and out the back door
Took time off to make a deal with myself
If I could keep this bottle up on the shelf
I'd drink a different drink for a while
And love my body love my style
I got lovers and I got friends
Got everything I need to meet the ends
Please don't look me in the eye
If you do I think I might cry
I got money and I got fame
The only thing I don't got
Is someone to blame
Leave me here so I can be a man
Gotta figure out the way that I am
I saw you
Sparkling
And squirming
Under him
I know now
What's right and wrong
And I know when
To turn that off

It's shining
And combining
I knew you
Way before you said -

"I love him
And 666
I want him
To make me sick
My love comes
With my snot
I’m all in
And he's all out"

Walk inside the club, then I hear my Blood walk
Thousand dollar shoes, yeah, that’s Giuseppe walk
Walk inside the house, Ferragamo on my carpet

Yellow diamonds in the Breitling looking like beer

Got your chick at the tele and she wilding Nick Cannon
Throw the op to Omelly and he probably gon' slam her

[Verse]
Hot summer nights cold still we lurking
Squad up, send a nigga home if he nervous
We ain't shooting just to get a name cause we murder
No witness they ain't see what happen but they heard 'em
We serve 'em, do they boys proper with them big choppers
Tell the law to call the coroners, forget the doctors
Cause that nigga dead, hit his body hit his dead
Left him there 

[?] put his soul up in the air
Ya, shit I can make you soldiers disappear
At the point of a finger, my man will point the banger
And take you pussy niggas out like fast food
Bad moves, I'll have him drop the shells like they cashews
Cash rules everything that's near me
So if you owe me money, you better bring it hurry, ya hear me?
A lot niggas they be scary
But I be in the hood super dirty like I'm Harry
Catch me I be fresher than I've been
Hater, no I've never been
You catch me in the squad I'm riding by you with that metal and
I be on the south side but north death forever him
From where they get that work and run that cheddar in
You better than, who not me
Mel Love and Young P
Be for real that Nigga 'Lil he a fucking young G
And I'm a boss you can tell Ricky Ross to come see
In Philly, where the murder rate get higher than a tree
That sour that D purp, piff ooh wee
Have a nigga on lean like promethazine
I'm a pro with the wings like pay less pay that
My niggas drop work and bring it way back, weigh that
Throw it in the hood, the fiends say it's good
And the dope boys they go crazy and come straight back
Like cornrows, you niggas on hoes
Fuck a brick, I'm trying to get it by the boat load
Getting money I wouldn't really say that
My niggas trying to turn a 62 into a Maybach
Drop pot and weigh that
Chop rock and slang that
Middle of the hood the narcs lurking where you stay at
My man told me never do dirt where you lay at
The fiends fiending got the work so fuck it I'mma take that
I ain't going to let it walk by me, I'mma chase that
There's money to be made got to make that, real

[Intro]
Why do you love me, do you love me?

[Verse 1]
Why do you love me?
There must be something in the water
'Cause, baby, I'm in deeper than I knew
How do you keep me coming back for more
After all we've been through?

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't decide if I should run and hide

[Chorus]
It's above and beyond me, it's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand
Just why I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me

[Verse 2]
Who knows why I love you
It could be something in the air I breathe
Whatever it is, I depend on it
And where does the time go?
I spend every single moment daydreaming of you

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't describe how I feel, it feels right

[Chorus]
It's above and beyond me, it's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand
Just why I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me

[Bridge]
You were a shot in the dark that blew me away
And you left your mark, and it never will fade
You've ignited a spark, let the fires away
Are you ready, ready?
You have a place in my heart that will always be yours
You are the peak and art of my universe
Every piece and part, you were the first
I am ready, ready

[Chorus]
It's above and beyond me, it's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand
Just why I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you

[Chorus]
It's above and beyond me, it's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand
Just why I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me

[Outro]
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?

[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Future, let's get right to it
I don't play about my paper
(DJ Khaled!)

[Chorus: Future]
Sippin' my cup with this muddy muddy
When I fuck on these bitches, no lovey-dovey
Got a flood on my wrist, I wear Mello Yello
Had a flood on my wrist, I wear yellow mellow
Check on that chick out the melo
I got that white on that white on the Panamera
Lil momma walkin' like Cinderella
See the fire on the pipes when I hit the pedal
I put the racks and the goons on 'em
I got a MAC with a drum on 'em
Soon as the drought hit, we laid on 'em
Two cups of the muddy, I swerve on 'em
Actavis Actavis, wait on it
Actavis Actavis, wait on it
Percocet roxies, we stay on 'em
Them Percocet roxies, we stay on 'em

[Bridge: Future]
Soon as I turn out the Ghost they was mad at me
I can see jealousy written on they face when they looked at me
They know I don't play about that paper
They know I don't play about that paper
They know I don't play about that paper
They know I don't play about that paper
They know I don't

[Verse: Rick Ross]
Rich nigga rituals, Rolls Royces and residuals
Residue in my residence, revenue was so plentiful
Rumors Rozay still be runnin' with all you criminals
Ransom notes and repercussions follow my ridicule
Private charters to Bahamas, that's how we send them through
Two new bitches up in Memphis that’s just for summer school
A nigga networth at an all-time high
I play for keeps, you just ran cross my mind (ah!)
I own all the things that these niggas plot for
Know they hatin', still resistin', go and cop more
She takin' off her clothes, know that's for a hot boy
Pistols in the lobby, honey on the top floor

[Bridge: Future]
Soon as I turn out the Ghost they was mad at me
I can see jealousy written on they face when they looked at me
They know I don't play about that paper
They know I don't play about that paper
They know I don't play about that paper
They know I don't play about that paper
They know I don't play about that paper
They know I don't play about that paper
They know I don't play about that paper
They know I don't play about that paper, yeah

[Chorus: Future]
Sippin' my cup with this muddy muddy
When I fuck on these bitches, no lovey-dovey
Got a flood on my wrist, I wear Mello Yello
Had a flood on my wrist, I wear yellow mellow
Check on that chick out the melo
I got that white on that white on the Panamera
Lil momma walkin' like Cinderella
See the fire on the pipes when I hit the pedal
I put the racks and the goons on 'em
I got a Mac with a drum on 'em
Soon as the drought hit, we laid on 'em
Two cups of the muddy, I swerve on 'em
Actavis Actavis, wait on it
Actavis Actavis, wait on it
Percocet roxies, we stay on 'em
Them Percocet roxies we stay on 'em

[Bridge: Future]

[Outro: Future]
All of these diamonds I copped them
All of these watches I copped them
All of these Bentleys we copped them
All of these Ghosts and I copped them
All of the Phantoms I copped them
All of these cribs we're coppin'
All of these bitches we coppin'
All of these bitches we coppin'
They know I don't play about that paper
I can see jealousy written on they face when they looked at me
They know I don't play about that paper

They know I don't play about that paper, yeah

[Verse 1]
I could never see your eyes
And I can't see past the lies
Which is why
I still long for us
And in the meantime
Here comes the chorus

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
I know you like your own kind
And that pulls me out of line
Which is why
I can drop anchor for a long time
When I am drunk
And I feel fine
Yeah, I feel fine

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
What do I gotta do, just to get your attention
When all I do is love you, oh you're just messin'
It's okay though, I'm used to it
But all those cuddles and kisses, yeah I'ma miss it
This ain't no break up song, I'm only saying what I feel
Real lyrics so people can actually feel
What I go through, just to make someone happy
You bet I'm probably tired of it, but in reality
Ain't no one's gonna be able to stop me
From loving anybody else, you see
I'm not obsessed, I'm only expressing myself
But that only leads to trouble, though...cause

[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

[Verse 2]
Cause you said you wouldn't hurt me, shit that was a mistake
Took me for granted, looked passed back, but still got hurt, mate
But it's my time to stand up, for myself, man up
Cause no one's gonna be by my side when I end up in ashes
So take an ecstasy, am I your ex to be
Are you using me as a rebound
Bet that, why wouldn't I, you're a hound
It's a little too late to apologize now
So forget how, you talked about your ex to me
How you would forget about him, bullshit you see
Your dumbass isn't gonna forget that easily
'Member when I said I'll call you, well...

[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

[Bridge]
Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes
Who are you to judge, who are you to judge?
Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies
Only you to trust, only you

[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only fuck you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

[Intro]
Check it
Uh, Songz
Hey, hey, hey

What up, Jasmine baby?
This should get to your ears
Wanna let you know your album is great
You my new favourite, baby, hoo

[Verse 1]
She bust the windows out my car
My black Mercedes
Twenty-two inch rims
I know it's probably 'cause I broke her heart
But right now
I don't care about that part
She bust the windows out my car
Couldn't believe it when I saw my ride
That very moment then I knew it was her
Can't even trip because I know I deserve

[Chorus]
I must admit it hurt a little bit
Thinking how could I lead her to do this
I never thought that she had so much strength
But she's gonna see what happens when
You throw a brick into a player's whip
It's gon' get violent
It's so childish
You'll probably say that it was worth your while
Well, I hope you had a chance to smile
I can't believe this

[Verse 2]
She bust the windows out my car
My black Mercedes
Twenty-two inch rims
Wrote her initials with a black crowbar
And when I find her
I will know where to start
She bust the windows out my car, oh
And man I'm lucky that that's all she did
I gotta fix this
Ain't this some bullshit
She bust my windows
Out my car
Went too far
Just cause the love thing we call ours fell apart
But she had to fuck up my car
But I ain't no pussy
I ain't goin trip
Spend a couple dollars
I'm a fix my shit
Girl, you know that you done f'd up now

[Chorus]
You threw a brick into a players whip
It's goin get violent
Cause it's so childish
She'll probably say that it was worth her while
Mad as I am, all I can do is smile, hahaha
She bust my windows
My black Mercedes
I know it's probably 'cause I broke her heart
I must admit I care about that part

[Verse 3]
Relationship messer-upper
Must a window buster
Baby, we made for each other
Ain't nothin better than your loving and come back
I need you bad like Jasmine Sullivan
I'm a puff 'til the endo gone
Riding in the whip with the windows gone
I can see you gettin your tip toe on
Quick, throw the brick
And dip, she's gone
Off in the night (Night) all cause of my (My) lies
Why, I can't get it right
I ride through the city lights
With my hat bent
Behind what used to be called black tints
I don't know, y'all
Wrote her initials with a crowbar
That means shorty go hard
It was just a one-night creep off
I ain't even take my sneaks off
I swear

[Outro]
I mean it's just a vehicle, baby

You can throw fits
Throw bricks
You still gonna be my chick
See, I can deal with some craziness
That mean you love me

Come back home, baby
Come back home
I need you bad
Hey

We just vibe out
The song will be over in a second
No trip
Just vibe to the ahs
She bust the windows out my car

[Intro: DJ Khaled]
We all got to go through storms
We all got to go through mud
Remember the sunshine on the other side
DJ Khaled

[Verse 1: John Legend]
First I got to give thanks to the most high
I've been through it all good and bad seen both side
Now we in the sky seem so high
And the view is so amazing that ain't no lie

[Chorus: John Legend]
You know what they say more money more problems
I guess they mad at us just cause we came from the bottom
I feel the rain the storm's coming in
But after the rain we'll be shining again (don't give up)

[Verse 2: John Legend]
Don't worry it won't rain forever
I've been through the craziest weather
The world is cold there ain't no one to call on
I thought you would be there for me I was all wrong

[Chorus: John Legend]
You know what they say more money more problems
I guess they mad at us just cause we came from the bottom
I feel the rain the storm's coming in
But after the rain we'll be shining again

[Outro: DJ Khaled]
Thak you for all of my blessings
All praise to the most high
The most high
Thank you

[Intro: Jeezy & Boosie Badazz]
Yeeeah!
Boosie Badazz, uh-huh

[Chorus: Future & DJ Khaled]
I said all these niggas fuck niggas
And they said they fuck wit' you (fuck 'em)
But really they don't fuck wit' you (don't trust 'em)
So I advise you not to fuck wit' 'em (DJ Khaled)
And so I bought the Wraith on 'em (Wraith boys)
I still got the paper plates on 'em (money boy)
And if you think I'm playin' wit' you
I'll ride on you niggas (I'll ride on you)
I'll ride on you niggas, I'll ride on you niggas
I'll ride on you niggas, I'll ride on you niggas
I'll ride on you niggas, I'll ride on you niggas
(It's We The Best Music)
I'll ride on you niggas, so I advise you not to fuck wit' em

[Verse 1: Boosie Badazz w/ Future]
Boosie Badazz
Boosie Mandela, I am the people's choices
We can take it there, but I take it much farther
Dude you don't know me, so you can't drink my bottle
Why when I was gone you ain't do nothing for my daughter?
Paper plate-living, niggas hating cause I'm ballin'
Boring his bitch, fucked her and spoiled
You don't wanna see me all I do is make a call
We have no specific victims, we want all y'all
Ridin' for the team, .45 wit' a beam
Plenty murder scenes so I advise you not to fuck wit' 'em
G-O-R-I-double-L-A
It's levels to this shit like my nigga Meek say
DJ Khaled, look

[Chorus: Future, Jeezy, & Rick Ross]
I said all these niggas fuck niggas
And they said they fuck wit' you
But really they don't fuck wit' you
So I advise you not to fuck wit' 'em
And so I bought the Wraith on 'em
I still got the paper plates on 'em (What?)
And if you think I'm playing wit' you (Yeah)
I'll ride on you niggas (Waaaaoohh)
I'll ride on you niggas, I'll ride on you niggas

I'll ride on you niggas, so I advise you not to fuck wit' em

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
All the bad bitches' real niggas holler when we enter
Sky dweller looking like chilly in the winter
Twelve gauge Mossberg, that bitch look like a chopper
If my dawg burst so I hand it to my partner
Heat game chip bitch I'm chilling on the floor
All white hit the door looking like a kilo
Ice machine refrigerator nigga what the hell
What they said about my watch when I spoke to Gabriel
Cash on the Wraith so this shit is not a lease
Hundred cash on the Cuban fuck I need with a piece
Catch you in the streets knock your top off like a Jeep
Then we show up at your funeral and piss all on your wreath
Ride on 'em

[Chorus: Future & Rick Ross]
I said all these niggas fuck niggas
And they said they fuck wit' you
But really they don't fuck wit' you
So I advise you not to fuck wit' 'em
And so I bought the Wraith on 'em
I still got the paper plates on 'em
And if you think I'm playing wit' you
I'll ride on you niggas
I'll ride on you niggas, I'll ride on you niggas
I'll ride on you niggas, I'll ride on you niggas
I'll ride on you niggas, I'll ride on you niggas (huh)
I'll ride on you niggas, so I advise you not to fuck wit' em

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Betting on a nigga I'ma go and get it
And if I set it on a nigga you can bet that I'ma go and hit it
These the laws that we live by
Same niggas that you're looking at the ones you getting slit by
Still moving how I wanna
For a brick, whole clique getting left in a coma
White glove it's a deadly game
You gon' fuck, top down say my name like Candyman
Maybach Music
All I want is real estate
Graduated from the corner 'til I send it up the interstate
Niggas hating on me
But I got a new plug and it got a truck waiting on me
M-M-M

[Chorus: Future]
I said all these niggas fuck niggas
And they said they fuck wit' you
But really they don't fuck wit' you
So I advise you not to fuck wit' 'em
And so I bought the Wraith on 'em
I still got the paper plates on 'em
And if you think I'm playing wit' you
I'll ride on you niggas
I'll ride on you niggas, I'll ride on you niggas
I'll ride on you niggas, I'll ride on you niggas
I'll ride on you niggas, I'll ride on you niggas
I'll ride on you niggas, so I advise you not to fuck wit' em

I'mma lie for my dawg, I'mma ride
Just know I'mma lie (DJ Khaled)

[Chorus: French Montana & Meek Mill]
I know I told you I stopped slanging ye
Strapped everyday, I lied, I lied, I lied
All the hoes say I'm fucking, every time I said I wasn't
Only you that I be fucking, I lied, I lied, I lied
Nah I ain't seen nothing, nah I ain't hear nothing
Want to talk to my lawyer, I lied, I lied, I lied
I swear to tell the truth, nothing but the whole truth
With my hand on the Bible, I lied, I lied, I lied
I know I told you I stopped slanging ye
Strapped everyday, I lied, I lied, I lied
All the hoes say I'm fucking, every time I said I wasn't
Only you that I be fucking, I lied, I lied, I lied
Nah I ain't seen nothing, nah I ain't hear nothing
Want to talk to my lawyer, I lied, I lied, I lied
I swear to tell the truth, nothing but the whole truth (Meek Milly)
With my hand on the Bible, (Let me tell you) I lied, I lied, I lied (Uhh)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I swear I swore to tell the truth, nothing but the whole truth
And I got up on that podium and lied (I lied, I lied)
Then the coppers swore to tell the truth
Nothing but the whole truth
And he got up on that podium and cried
Said I tried to take his life and the judge ain't take my side
Cause when you black, that risk is high
To beat that case against them odds
Against them guys with your last bit of money for your lawyer
My heart dropped when I seen him hit the corner
They was in the black Taurus, Dodge Charger, Explorer
Beat me to the ground and used my blood to mop the floor
But I'mma hold the water like it was holy water
Informants told informants how we had it and they swarmed us
They caught us

[Chorus: French Montana & Beanie Sigel]
I know I told you I stopped slanging ye
Strapped everyday, I lied, I lied, I lied
All the hoes say I'm fucking, every time I said I wasn't
Only you that I be fucking, I lied, I lied, I lied
Nah I ain't seen nothing, nah I ain't hear nothing
Want to talk to my lawyer, I lied, I lied, I lied
I swear to tell the truth, nothing but the whole truth (Uh-huh)
With my hand on the Bible (Uh-huh), I lied, I lied, I lied (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel w/ French Montana]
Only swear by a law so when approached by them folks
I spit the truth when I swore under oath (I lied, I lied)
Shit, cause I don't take the stand on niggas
I rather give it to that man up close (Blocka, blocka)
I told my cellie in the jail I wouldn't rap no more
See you when they free you cuz cause I ain't coming back no more
Wifey on the highway with them kids driving back on fouth
Knowing if a nigga violate that I'd be back in court
Reside in somebody's federal estate
Niggas jumping on your case, worst than First 48
I seen a rat stand up on his case that wish he told
Come on a pill and give a nigga a will

[Chorus: French Montana & Jadakiss]
I know I told you I stopped slanging ye
Strapped everyday, I lied, I lied, I lied
All the hoes say I'm fucking, every time I said I wasn't
Only you that I be fucking, I lied, I lied, I lied
Nah I ain't seen nothing (Uh), nah I ain't hear nothing (Nah)
Want to talk to my lawyer, I lied, I lied, I lied (You know my rights)
I swear to tell the truth (Ahem), nothing but the whole truth (Hah-hah)
With my hand on the Bible, I lied, I lied, I lied (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Jadakiss, French Montana, Jadakiss & French Montana]
It was we vs. them vs. three then ten
Swore I never re again but I lied, I lied (I lied)
Now the package is enormous and that come with informants
We already kinda hot so it's stupid to keep it on us
We just being hard headed, disregarding the drop
Them they bagged him in the cab
And brought him back to the spot
Found six P's of piffy, a little under fifty
That little bit of bread make the relationship shifty
And it's all my fault he still tryna to convince me
I miss my goddaughter, I wonder if she miss me
Birthdays and Christmas, I ain't never missed it
Her dad is my brother, I love him from a distance

[Chorus: French Montana & Jadakiss]
I know I told you I stopped (What?) slanging ye
Strapped everyday, I lied, I lied, I lied
All the hoes say I'm fucking, every time I said I wasn't
Only you that I be fucking, I lied, I lied, I lied
Nah I ain't seen nothing, nah I ain't hear nothing
Want to talk to my lawyer, I lied, I lied, I lied
I swear to tell the truth, nothing but the whole truth
With my hand on the Bible, I lied, I lied, I lied
I know I told you I stopped slanging ye
Strapped everyday, I lied, I lied, I lied
All the hoes say I'm fucking, every time I said I wasn't
Only you that I be fucking, I lied, I lied, I lied
Nah I ain't seen nothing, nah I ain't hear nothing
Want to talk to my lawyer, I lied, I lied, I lied
I swear to tell the truth, nothing but the whole truth
With my hand on the Bible, I lied, I lied, I lied

On everything I love, It’s We The Best Music
It’s We The Best over everything
Get money, mo’ money

[Chorus: French Montana]
Every time we come around
Doors goin’ up, panties goin’ down
Every time we come around
Y’all throw that money up, catch it comin’ down
Every time we come around
Baby let me blow a hundred on you
Every time we come around
Put your hand up, down

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
You know I got that check on me
You know I got that 9 on me
Play with it or get religious
These shots’ll make your shirt holey
Say please lord, forgive a nigga
Actin’ up like Ben Stiller
Jewelry on me so fuckin’ cold
I gotta wear it with a chinchilla
I ball on these fuck niggas, Bron-Bron, D Wade
Whip white like cocaine, too dope, Rick James
I’m hardbody, my flow sick
That Eagle on me no Mike Vick
I bob and weave in that pussy good
And I knock it out like Tyson
Say first round, face down, ass up, straight pound
Yeah shorty, she know the deal
And that’s every time that I come ‘round
This big business, I come around, smoking on that too loud
Give my dog about 1200, in twenty minutes he goin’ down

[Chorus: French Montana]
Every time we come around
Doors goin’ up, panties goin’ down
Every time we come around

[Verse 2: Vado]
It’s my year, Slime here
Cartier box face, call it the time’s square
Why year, I drive and fly Lear
V-16, need a coupe with nine gears
Yeah! Mob member, star agenda
Serve niggas over these bars like bartenders (Yes!)
I bob cats while shooting like guard Kemba
Hard in the paint, I stretch it, Lew Alcindor
F it, you all dinners, no protection
Tired of hearing these deadlines, no reception
Need work like wi-fi, no connection
We The Best men be the best in, cause

[Chorus: French Montana]
Every time we come around
Doors goin’ up, panties goin’ down
Every time we come around
Y’all throw that money up, catch it comin’ down
Every time we come around
Baby let me blow a hundred on you
Every time we come around
Put your hand up, down

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
They think I’ma gun ‘em down
Just ‘cause I’m a motherfucking king from the underground
Rest in peace Pimp, name live long as Bun around
Niggas know me, 100 keys, 500 pounds
Way too advanced for these lames, had to dumb it down (Mmm)
Nigga try to run off with some change, I’ma hunt him down
All they do is run they mouth; me, I just run the town (Haha)
Cause the industry is being ran by a bunch of clowns
Circus, it hurts cause
Everybody’s a boss and nobody’s the workers (Real shit)
Shit is getting weird
All I know is when I look ‘em in the eyes, they be scared, what

[Chorus: French Montana]
Every time we come around
Doors goin’ up, panties goin’ down
Every time we come around
Y’all throw that money up, catch it comin’ down
Every time we come around
Baby let me blow a hundred on you
Every time we come around
Put your hand up, down

This We the Best Music, WTB

[Chorus: Ace Hood]
I ain't worried, I ain't worried
Every time I jump on a beat, these niggas get nervous
Ho naw, I ain't worried, just know I ain't worried
Rap game that's mine due time ain't lyin', y'all gotta be worried
Ho naw, I ain't worried, these niggas ain't worthy
Long as my family straight, you know homeboy I ain't worried
Ho naw, I ain't worried, ain't worried bout 'em
Ain't worried bout 'em, naw

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
The illest nigga know this, the king cat has spoken
I run the south and you run your mouth
So please quit with the assumptions
Niggas in the Benzo 10-4
Ridin' with the chopper clip extendo
Ain't no game, this ain't Nintendo
Blowing on the highest grade of indo
Rockin' Givenchy, Givenchy, Givenchy
Hop on the beat and I catch me a body
Millionaire hundred million deposit
Just so my niggas, we each can divide it
Talkin' bout money all over the table
Money all over the floor, ugh
Killaz they all in the Porsche
Pourin' champagne on them whores
All my nerves best rolla, Ferrari doin' donuts
Ain't worried bout a damn thing, young nigga big nuts, ha!
Laughing at all you rap niggas out tryna sound like Hood
You can keep that flow, hope it tastes good

[Chorus: Ace Hood]
I ain't worried, I ain't worried
Every time I jump on a beat these niggas get nervous
Ho naw, I ain't worried, just know I ain't worried
Rap game that's mine due time ain't lyin', y'all gotta be worried
Ho naw, I ain't worried, these niggas ain't worthy
'Long as my family straight, you know homeboy I ain't worried
Ho naw, I ain't worried, ain't worried bout 'em
Ain't worried bout 'em, naw

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
First 48, ahah, yeah
I'm a threat to these niggas, it's kill or be killed
On the night he get murdered, I be somewhere in Brazil
The Feds tappin' my raps, got the keys to success
My whole team gettin' rich, I know these haters feel pressure (Woo)
Retaliation a must, put a bag on it, nigga
All day he on Twitter, straight rat on a nigga (M-M-M)
I'm Mr. drivin' my Bentleys, all my foes gettin' mad
Underground I'm a king, posting pictures with Chad
Swisher Sweets in my luggage, Belaire in my bucket
Niggas know where I be, we straight mobbin' like Duddy's
Ace gon' be my nigga, I make him clap through your window
Better watch how you talkin', this SK be a blender, haaa

[Chorus: Ace Hood]
I ain't worried, I ain't worried (M-M-M)
Every time I jump on a beat these niggas get nervous (M-M-M)

[Hook]
I know I shouldn't have did that
I know it's come right back
I know its' going to destroy everything I made
It's probably gon' get your boy sent away
But this game I play ain't no way to fix it it's inevitable

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Bills gotta get paid, kids gotta eat
Live by the chopper laws die by the streets
Fuck a job getting paid dollars by the week
I call my calls nigga I'm my own boss
Some niggas travel for the duffle make the wrong calls
And the 

[?] take the long fall
That's why I grind trying to shine like a lone star
To get mine right, my money and mind right
My mom right in the mix, pistol in my palm tight
You worried by a limelight I'd rather get my grind right
I rhyme nice, niggas trying to stunt like it's prom night
But I'm in my prime like Lebron in the highlight
That's why theses niggas can't stop me, copy nor clone
That's why these hoes on my, they the boy hungry
They heard I keep it real them other boys phony
But I'mma give these niggas hell 'til the lord call me

[Hook]
I know I shouldn't have did that
I know it's come right back
I know its' going to destroy everything I made
It's probably gon' get your boy sent away
But this game I play ain't no way to fix it it's inevitable

[Verse 2: Black Dinero]
The flow sick but I find ways to make it better
That block hot but I find ways to make that cheddar
I might drop my album might flop
But I got a lot of guap so my watch gon' shine forever
I got blocks of chicken, I love my position
I'm realer than these rappers I ain't got no competition
I'm in my own division, I make my own decisions
You tryna to stop what I'm building then I'm going to prison
I swear on everything, dawg I'll let it ring
Rock your fucking bells like LL 

[?] fucking rip my change
Now listen I play careful in these streets
You want to hear the real then stick your ear up to this beat
I flow hard go hard cause I got to homie
I got it soft I got is hard who tryna cop it homie
This game I play is realer than a 

[?]

[?] still fighting on that 

[?] boy

[Hook]
I know I shouldn't have did that
I know it's come right back
I know its' going to destroy everything I made
It's probably gon' get your boy sent away
But this game I play ain't no way to fix it it's inevitable

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Wrong time wrong place caught the wrong case
They had me sitting in the F getting the O face
Thinking hard

[Verse 1]
So lost and so alone, can't take it no more
You watch me lose control dancing on the floor

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Wanna feel the pound of a heartbeat?
Do you wanna feel a rush when I go insane?
I wanna be unwrapped like a candy cane
The only ones you love, no time for pain
Wanna be a bad little secret?
Do you wanna feel the blood running through your veins?
I wanna be the girl inside your brain
But only for a night wanna play the game

[Chorus]
I look to your eyes, they flicker like mine
We kiss in the rain
I don't even know your name
We're soaring so high through thundering skies
Do you feel the same?
I don't even know your name

[Verse 2]
Your touch electrifies my body and soul
You're such a sweet escape now I can't let go

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I wanna lose myself in the passion
Do you wanna be my boy? Wanna run away?
I wanna stick with you on a kiss and chase
I can see me chilling at your place
Only one to be a distraction
Now the only thing I see seems to be your face
I wanna be the girl that keeps you safe
I only meant tonight, but it must be fate

[Chorus]
I look to your eyes, they flicker like mine
We kiss in the rain
I don't even know your name
We're soaring so high through thundering skies
Do you feel the same?
I don't even know your name

[Refrain]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I don't even know your name
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I don't even know your name

[Bridge]
I, I will not just fall in love, fall in love right here
I, I can't fight this feeling, oh, feeling so lovesick
Oh, I really can't believe this, but it's so damn true
So much magic come between us
Now I'm all for you

[Chorus]
I look to your eyes, they flicker like mine
We kiss in the rain
I don't even know your name
We're soaring so high through thundering skies
Do you feel the same?
I don't even know your name

[Refrain]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I don't even know your name
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I don't even know your name

[Verse 1]
These nigga's knock off diamonds are shining
But they ain't blinding
No pizza, bitch, I got banks in my pockets
Where's the ladder I'm climbing
She gon' pop, lock it and drop it
I ain't talking wrist but she watching
Me right now, hundred bands stuffed in my jeans right now
YSL, there's no "I" in "team" right now, no way
Beating the block till the sun come up
I'm rocking gold like Rols-R-Us
I talk more shit than Damien does
I put the steel up and stain lil' cuz
I, I, I, I be that Young Thugger Thug
Throwing these bitches straight off of the boat
We don't save them
Hey, a wise man told me nothin'
He said them snitches they get stitches
I just spent a Bentley on my kidneys
Saying I gave my bro the address to road to riches

[Chorus]
I, I might just take care of bae
Yeah, I might just make her my latest
On my worse day she a 9 like Brady
But I traded in the Keisha or Kaycee's
Yeah, she love me, she love me, love me for that
Yeah, she love me, she love me, love me for that
Yeah, she love it, I'm honest she loving that
Yeah, my love is so big she can't lose that

[Interlude]
Thugger
Ayy, yeah, yeah
Sing to her, yeah
That's how you do it nigga
That's how you motherfucking do it nigga
Peep this, ayy

[Verse 2]
L-O-V-E, I say lil' mama down to ride and die for me
Okay, you green no seaweed
Psych, I want you to hurry get into me
I drop like ten thousands ones on her lil' buns
I told her come on home hun
You can have my son
We eat ching chong, diamonds they go boing
Hop inside that pussy like a trampoline, boing boing
Hey wait
Grab that lil' ass by the way
Beep beep beep like a bus on that ass, so big
I swear to God I'ma fuck her now her body getting big
I swear to God I'ma do everything that I ain't did
Plus broadie said that bitch pussy bright pink as a pig

[Chorus]
I, I might just take care of bae
Yeah, I might just make karat my ladies
On my worse day she a 9 like Brady
But I traded in the Keisha or Kaycee's
Yeah, she love me, she love me, love me for that
Yeah, she love me, she love me, love me for that
Yeah, she love it, I'm honest she loving that
Yeah, my love is so big she can't lose that

[Intro]

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey, yeah
When you don't want me to move, but you tell me to go
What do you mean? Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running out of time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind, what do you mean?

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
You’re so indecisive of what I'm sayin'
Tryna catch the beat, make up your heart
Don't know if you're happy or complainin'
Don't want for us to end, where do I start?

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
First you wanna go to the left, then you wanna turn right (Right)
Wanna argue all day, makin' love all night (All night)
First you're up, then you’re down, and then between ('Tween)
Oh, I really wanna know

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey, yeah
When you don't want me to move, but you tell me to go
What do you mean? Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're runnin' outta time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind, what do you mean?

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
You’re overprotective when I’m leaving
Tryna compromise, but I can’t win
You wanna make a point, but you keep preachin'
Had me from the start, don't let this end

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber & Ariana Grande]
First you wanna go to the left, then you wanna turn right
(Turn right)
Wanna argue all day, makin' love all night (All night)

Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind, what do you mean?

[Outro: Justin Bieber & Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber]
Oh, oh (Don't be so selfish baby, yeah)
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey, yeah (You're so confusing baby)
When you don't want me to move (Hey), but you tell me to go
What do you mean? (Be more straight forward)
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running outta time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind, what do you mean?

[Verse 1: Bibi Bourelly (Usher)  Together ]
I'mma get mine, you should get yours too
Shooting, shooting, shooting, man them boys always shoot
(American dream, American man too)
Shooting, shooting, shooting, watch them boys always shoot
(And I-I-I-I been so tired of being insecure
So tired of)
I've had enough running
Running, and running and running and running
(Running)
Running, and running and running and running and
(Running enough)
Just give it up
I don't give a fuck
I've had enough
Y'all give a fuck? No
Light it on fire
I've had enough
Running, and running and running and running
Running, and running and running and running and

[Hook:  Usher & Bibi Bourelly]
You act like the change
Tryna put me in chains
Don't act like you saving us
It's still the same
Man don't act like I made it up
You blaming us
Let's keep it one hundred
You gave the name to us
Nigga
We still in chains
We still in chains
We still in chains
We still in chains
We still in chains

You put the shame on us

[Post-Hook:  Usher & Bibi Bourelly]
Now, now, now shame on us

Now, now, now

[Verse 2: Usher (Bibi Bourelly) Together]
Moment of silence
American school and we in church too (Don't shoot)
Shooting, shooting, shooting, we the prey
Always shoot (Prey)
I'mma be trill, you should be trill too
You don't even gotta talk we just shoot
And I feel so tired of being insecure
Just give it up
Don't give a fuck
Light it on fire

[Verse 3: Nas]
Yeah, yo check
I am Sugar Ray Robinson, Booker T. Washington
W. E. B. Du Bois, I'm the modern one
Yelling at Senators, Presidents, Congressmen
We got a problem that needs some acknowledgement
I am no prison commodity, not just a body you throw in a cell
For any reason, just to bother me
Just for your quota, so it's rest in peace to Sean Bell
Sleep in peace Eric Garner (Sandra)
Every street, every corner
Conspiracy, new world order
I spoke to Tamir Rice mom and she told me "be strong"
It won't be long 'til it's justice
They won't have votes but refuse the discussion
On how certain cops they shoot us for nothing
Revolution is coming

[Hook: Usher (Nas) Together]
You act like the change
(The land of opportunity)
Tryna put me in chains
(The land of Unity)
Don't act like you saving us
(Brotherhood, trust)
It's still the same
(America)
Man don't act like I made it up
You blaming us
(You know)
Let's keep it one hundred
You gave the name to us
Nigga
We still in chains
(Hey so what up my nigga?)
We still in chains
We still in chains
You see these chains?
We still in chains
I can't see
We still in chains
The difference from how we used to be
We still in chains
We still in chains
You put the shame on us

[Post-Hook: Usher & Bibi Bourelly]
Now, now, now shame on us
Now
Now, now, now shame on us
Now, now, now
You put the shame on us)

[Outro: Usher]
We still in chains
We still in chains
We still in chains
We still in chains
We still in chains
We still in chains
We still in chains
You put the shame on us

[Verse 1]
Happier than ever before
No second chances
Cause I love my friends and my opponents
You were still the same as me
Only I enhance it
Magic lives in this sacred moment
I am here and I'm still free
See my flame's still dancing
My eclipsing for your enjoyment
Feel this conscious energy
And on these romancing
Life is better when you're open

[Chorus]
Live today, if only for one moment
The light of your life is everywhere
Live today, if only for one moment
The light of your life is everywhere, where
Everywhere, where

[Verse 2]
I am not the sun of your imagination
Yet the sun to your harmony and brighter places, oh
I am just a higher tangible dimension
Yet I'm roaming 'round this walking life with sweet intention
Darkness can't survive within this lighter presence
Hold on to the moment like you truly meant it, oh
Take a break from everything with no exception
Just to lie amongst the ambience that is presented

[Chorus]
Live today, if only for one moment
The light of your life is everywhere
Live today, if only for one moment
The light of your life is everywhere, where (it's everywhere)
Where, where

[Outro]
Now let's live a life we thought we never had
Just know everything is all development
And I hope you see for what it is instead
Unknown pleasures in this environment
Now let's live a life we thought we never had
Just know everything is all development
And I hope you see for what it is instead
Unknown pleasures in this environment

Most of us, they talk shit, but they can't fuck with most of us
Most of us, they talk shit, but can't come close to most of us

Most of us, they talk shit, but can't come close to most of us

Most of us, they talk shit but they can't fuck with most of us
Most of us, they talk shit, but can't come close to most of us

[Verse 1]
Most of us, ride around with pistols, we don't give a fuck
Most of us, down to rep that gang and we gon' throw it up
Most of us, brought our own dope and we down to smoke
Most of us, need a bad bitch with some good throat
Most of us, came from nothin', we get somethin', we gon' ball
Most of us, got that work for sale, we just need a call
Most of us, 'bout that change, pop his brain, no remains
Most of us, feel no pain, homie, it's a dirty game
Most of us, never seen this comin' so we feelin' blessed
Most of us, got alotta shit to get up off our chest
Most of us, still up in the field right where niggas get killed

[Verse 2]
Most of us, made our own way without a hand out
Most of us, smoke that loud kush so we stand out
Most of us, rather get the top instead of fuckin' that bitch
Most of us, rather pass her off instead of lovin' the bitch
Most of us, spend thousands on clothes, still don't care how we dress
Most of us, seen the top but still know what the bottom is
Most of us, keep your main bitch in our phone
Most of us, keep Khalifa kush in the bong
Started off with nothin' now my niggas is on
If we got a problem, we don't put it in song
Most of us, got our change up, never change up
Most of us, Taylor Gang or, you a stranger

[Verse 1]
I was a midnight rider on a cloud of smoke
I could make a woman hang on every single stroke
I was an iron man, I had a master plan
But I was alone

[Verse 2]
I could hear you breathing with a sigh of the wind
I remember how your body started trembling
Oh, what a night it's been and for the state I'm in
I'm still alone

[Bridge]
And all the wonders made for the earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Somehow I always end up alone (always end up alone)
Always end up alone

[Chorus]
So I play, I'll wait
Cause you know that love takes time
We came so far
Just the beat of a lonely heart
And it's mine
And I don't want to be alone

[Verse 3]
Well, since I got no message on your answer phone
Since you're busy every minute I just stay at home
I make believe you care, I feel you everywhere
But I'm still alone

[Verse 4]
I'm on a wheel of fortune with a twist of fate
Cause I know it isn't heaven, is it love or hate?
Am I the subject of the pain? Am I the stranger in the rain?
I am alone

And if there glory there to behold
Maybe it's my imagination
Another story there to be told

[Chorus]
So I play, I'll wait
And I pray it's not too late
We made it so far
Just a beat of a lonely heart
And it's mine
And I don't want to be alone

[Bridge]
And all the wonders made for the earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Another story there to be told

[Chorus]
So I play, I'll wait
And I pray it's not too late
We made it so far
Just a beat of a lonely heart
And it's mine
And I don't want to be alone

[Outro]
Gone but not out of sight
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home
Face the heat of the night
The one that you love got a heart that's made of stone

Shine and search for the light
And sooner or later you'll be cruising on your ocean
And clean out of sight
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home

Face the heat of the night
The one that you love got a heart that's made of stone

Shine and search for the light
And sooner or later you'll be cruising on your ocean

And clean out of sight
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home

[Verse 1]
Tinseltown is coming like a giant bleeding heart
And I'm so mad, well these kids try to be funny man
But I don't think it's happened much
So we must destroy your art
And you'll be glad that you stopped sinning
And stopped caring about trying to do
New things are a dream that every single person has
And it's not real
Well I know I'm not too well equipped
But things go by so quickly I can scarcely start to grasp
The things I'm feelin' now, and I don't doubt
That everyone can feel it too

[Chorus]
Everything is happenin' so fast
(Everything is happenin' so fast)
Everything is happenin' so fast
(Everything is happenin' so fast)

[Verse 2]
Nature is to blame for the things we cannot tame
So, let's destroy it, oh
I don't know about you
But I feel like a barbarian man, stop me if you can

[Bridge]
When the poison drips
To create the same type of graph
Available at your fingertips
When the poison drips
It drips

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Everything is happenin' so fast
(Everything is happenin' so fast)
Everything is happenin' so fast
(Everything is happenin' so fast)
Everything is happenin' so fast
(Everything is happenin' so fast)
Everything is happenin' so fast
(Everything is happenin' so fast)

[Verse 1]
Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

[Pre-Chorus]
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Verse 2]
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

[Pre-Chorus]
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

[Chorus]
So hello from the other side (Other side)
I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (Outside)
At least, I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Bridge]
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Ooh, anymore
(Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
Anymore

[Chorus]
Hello from the other side (Other side)
I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (Outside)
At least, I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Gotta cut this and it's an '86
And it's red and white like a peppermint
Got a charger with a body kit, cause the 26 inches couldn't fit
Got a Rolex, costs 60 cent
Police pulled me over, said they couldn't see through tint
Obama Kush, 10 presidents
I spend my whole month rent on an ounce of it
Got a 45 dome, leave the house without it
Got Saks Fifth Ave in my closet, bitch
I got a college bitch, I didn't graduate
But I'm college rich I need knowledge bitch
Wayne Gretzky wrist with no hockey stick
And I ain't fuckin' with you, got a picky dick
I got your girl, lil' stick on my pocket book
Sayin' watcha wanna do, but won't knock the bitch
I'm in a drop 6
I might talk slick, but baby girl, I ain't here just to pop shit
Need 30 more man in this topless bitch
Gimme topp kit kick rocks bitch
Need you in the car to get topless
Got a bitch, 1 hoe, I'mma flight risk

Smokin' cannabis in a bluff, bitch get on this bus

Man, your nigga broke, he a lie buy you just a car
That necklace cost me damn near 30 thousand, this changed her heart
My young bitch would take the charge
Fuckin' so many hoes that she paranoid

We at your dome probably boxes fuckin' with the squad

They were my world
Girl you know i never sleep

You're my world
It's got me turning inside out
Just for you
You're my girl
Girl you know i never sleep
Don't you know i never sleep
You're my world
It's got me turning inside out
I think about you bathed in doubt
Across these winds
Across these clouds

And if this ain't no place thats real
I guess i cross these winds and clouds
She keeps me like
Oh well these blood stain sheets
Oh well these blood stain sheets
They were my world

Don't you know i never sleep
You're my world
It's got me turning inside out
Just for you you're my girl
Girl you know i never sleep
Don't you know i never sleep
You're my world
It's got me turning inside out
I think about you all the time

If this was no place this here
Across these winds
Across these clouds
It keeps me like

Oh well these blood stain sheets

They were my world
Girl you know i never sleep

You're my world
It's got me turning inside out
Just for you you're my girl
Girl you know i never sleep
Don't you know i never sleep
You're my world
Its got me turning in out

Girl

[Intro]
Let me get more volume
Nah, nah
Louder than my voice

[Verse]
Roll some, think I’ll roll some
To know some, if we both honest
Who lasts? Yeah, you lie
Spent the whole summer
Tryna be at the wrong place at the right time
But I know what's mine when I see it
I know, I know, I know when I see it
Riding down the 405, baby
Pacing, thinking, to myself
If I should make it right
When I pulled up to the light
And then my phone started ringing
Diamonds in the colors of those eyes
Don’t know why, but I know a sign when I see it

[Couplet 1: Kanye West]
Why would she make calls out the blue
Now I'm awake, sleep (less in June) or (missing you)

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, unless you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, then play you will, I pray you will

[Harmonizing]

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, you do
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, one day you will, I pray you will

[Couplet 2: Kanye West]
When I grab your neck, I touch your soul
Take off your cool, then lose control

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, you will, you will
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Don't say you will, if you will, I pray you will

[Verse 3: Kanye West & Caroline Shaw]
I wish this song would really come true
I wish this song would really come true
I wish this song, this song could play and could come true
I wish this song, "Say You Will," would come true
I wish this song
I admit I still fantasize about you, about you
I admit I, don't say, I admit I, don't say I admit I

[Chorus: Kanye West & Caroline Shaw]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
I admit I, I admit I
Don't say you will, you will, you will
Say you will, say you will
Don't say I, don't say I
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Please say you will, for real, I pray you will

[Instrumental Outro]
Your long hair – a short walk
My biggest fear and a slow watch
In the thin air, my ribs creak
Like wooden dining chairs when you see me
Always scared that every situation ends the same
With a blank stare
Me and the tap water circling the sink drain
Because it's heavy, but I'm trying really hard
To keep my nose clean, and the blue out of my arms
But it's not easy

It's not easy when what you think of me is important
And I know it shouldn't be so damn important
But it is to me
And I'm only ever screaming at myself in public
I know I shouldn't act this way in public
I know I shouldn't make my friends all worry
When I go out at night
And grind my teeth like sutures, my mouth like a wound
When I stay up and throw my voice about you
Or less about you and more about
How I ruin everything I think could be good news

[Verse 1]
Standin' over the stove, yeah that chicken pot
Playa hatin' spreading like the chickenpox
Smoke so much, you'd think I have dreadlocks
And I'ma start back robbin' if the bread stop
I get you killed on the inside green dot
I'll make your plug rob you, whole house be cleaned out
Ain't no real niggas in the club unless my team out
Magazine in my jeans and I don't like to read
All my niggas love to eat, I got sharks to feed
I hustle 8 days out the week, you're not no boss to me
I tote the rock like Barry Sanders, I never dropped a key
And I'ma cook it for you for free but I usually charge a fee

[Hook]
Whippin', whippin', whippin', whippin', whippin', whippin', whippin'
Woke up in the kitchen and I started mad whippin'
Woke up in the dam with a 100 bad bitches
Woke up in the kitchen and I started mad whippin'
Whippin', whippin', whippin', whippin', whippin'
Woke up in the kitchen and I started mad whippin'
Woke up in the dam with a 100 bad bitches
Screamin' "money over bitches" and I started mad whippin'
Whippin'

[Verse 2]
Whip! All my dope is whippable
All my bricks are flippable, so extra grams are tippable
My living room the chicken room, my bedroom is the treasury
I'm whippin dope excessively, I pick my trap selectively
He peekin' in the kitchen, so I feel he disrespectin' me
I'm pushin' man, but sellin' dope has always been my legacy
Seven apartments, double my garment, all the junkies beggin' me
Pills and pints and ecstasy, I need a secretarity
Damn, I said it wrong, but fuck it, I'm a celebrity
I'm re-rockin' squares, a hundred thousand profit regularly
So let me get this straight, I'm tryna hear this shit you tellin' me
You can't price this dope I'm sellin' unless you dumb niggas that's mailin' me

[Hook]
Whippin', whippin', whippin', whippin', whippin', whippin', whippin'
Woke up in the kitchen and I started mad whippin'
Woke up in the dam with a 100 bad bitches
Woke up in the kitchen and I started mad whippin'
Whippin', whippin', whippin', whippin', whippin'
Woke up in the kitchen and I started mad whippin'
Woke up in the dam with a 100 bad bitches
Screamin' "money over bitches" and I started mad whippin'
Whippin'

[Lyrics from Snippet]

Back to back like Money May and I'm steady rolling
Back to back in that Bach and I'm strapped with that clapper on me
32 and the nigga running
Itchy fingers I shoot it like I was Stephen Curry
These niggas pussy and in their feelings like February
The fourteen, ever since they murk Chinx I've been rolling...

Back to back
I got Nicki know they mad at that
When I'm riding pump these niggas like an asthma attack
Cause when we run into them ain't no pass for that
I don't want to hear niggas talking Nicki again

[?] Rozay brought 

[?] again...

...cracking
We was in the clubs we was getting these brackets
Ducking Chris Brown you was missing in action
And I was like damn how you getting in past him...

[Intro]
You heard me?

[Verse]
Still the same Cam, who I was is who I am
Drive the Chevy like a Lam, rollin' up by the gram
Always stickin' to the plan, them other niggas lack the vision
I'm 20/20 and my eyes lower than theirs
I ride slower, supersize motor when you pull up they outside of the crib
You outsiders, we in, we outshine 'em
Taylor gang or outline 'em, ya dig?

[Hook]
Ridin' with my windows down, roll another paper up
We just on our grind, workin', tryin' to get our paper up
Workin' on myself, workin' on myself
While I work on everybody else, everybody else
Homie, I been workin' on myself, workin' on myself
While I work on everybody else, everybody else

[Instrumental Outro]

[Verse 1]
This a feeling I wish could never end
Remember days they didn't let us in but now we in this bitch, rollin up medicine in my kush stronger than it ever been
My bitch don't know better than my clique, down for whatever
Thinking back, first time in Vegas, when I caught my first suite, thinking I was major
Looking at it all the light smoking on the paper
Thinking how to get it out my grind, second nature
I don't ever wait
I love the rush, I don't hesitate
I'm trying to teach my son a better way
Watch who you call your friends
Watch who you left right in your 9 11
Watch who you left sleeping at night at your crib
Its tatted on me: loyalty, and dog that's all I live
Some decent beats about a bitch to smoke this chronic with
I hit the streets
I'm fly as fuck, they say I'm on my shit
These unreleased and no receipts
They know about the kid

[Ambient Rainbow Sounds]

[?]

What do you want from me, I can't help you out
Take what you need from me, and get out, get out

What do you think about, when I sing to you, to let it go
What do you see in your mind, when I say to let it go, let it go

I can go twice as high, butterfly in the sky (x4)

What do you see in your mind, when i say to let it go, let it go
What do you think about when i sing to you, to let it go
What do you see in your mind, when i say to let it go, let it go

[Verse 1]
Silver sateen, where she hiding
Love will come my way
Sometimes i'm up, sometimes i down
And i'm wondering if things are ever gonna turn around
One thing i know, time changes all
And i spend most of 

[?], just waiting for my turn to fall
(turn to fall, turn to fall)
Falling so hard for someone, when is that time gonna come

[Chorus]
Like a bright light, she'll be shining tonight
Where she hiding, when the times right
Love will come my way
(love will come my way)
I guess i'll keep on waiting
Why she hesitating
When the times right, love will come my way
Love will come my way ay ay ay, way ay ay ay, way ay ay ay
(love will come my way)

[Verse 2]
Everyone i see, they all got someone
Well me, i got no one, no one for me
And i don't sweat it, no i just don't get it
There must be somebody, out there for me
There'll be a time and a place
(there'll be a time and a place)
I'll know her when i see her face

[Chorus]
Like a bright light, she'll be shining tonight
Where she hiding, when the times right
Love will come my way
(love will come my way)
I guess i'll keep on waiting
Why she hesitating
When the times right, love will come my way
Love will come my way ay ay ay, way ay ay ay, way ay ay ay
(love will come my way)

[Bridge]
And i guess i'll keep on waiting
Why she hesitating
When the times right, love will come my way
Love will come my
Whoa oh whoa oh x4
Love will come my way
Whoa oh whoa oh x4
Love will come my way

[Chorus]
Like a bright light, she'll be shining tonight
Where she hiding, when the times right
Love will come my way
(love will come my way)
I guess i'll keep on waiting
Why she hesitating
When the times right, love will come my way
Love will come my way ay ay ay, way ay ay ay, way ay ay ay
Whoa oh whoa oh x4
(love will come my way x2)
Way ay ay ay, way ay ay ay, way ay ay ay
Love will come way

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a bright light, she'll be shining tonight
Where she hiding, when the times right
Love will come my way

[Verse 1]
I've figured out where I went wrong
The script not followed then was awfully long
Too much pluck, too little of
The acting right, not actin' up

[Verse 2]
I've worn the world upon my back
Would someone else but me pick up the slack?
Just because I could say
It's my life, do things my way

[Chorus]
Now I'm lookin' up more than I look down
The view's a whole lot better second time around
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground

[Verse 3]
Color a lot with a broader stroke
The laughter comes as easy as the jokes
Nowadays, I'm thinkin' 'bout
Time is wasted lookin' back

[Chorus]
Now I'm lookin' up more than I look down
The view's a whole lot better second time around
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground

[Bridge]
You drop a bucket in a well
It's dark and deep down there
Crank the handle, bring it up
The water, crystal clear

[Chorus]
I'm lookin' up more than I look down
The view's a whole lot better second time around
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground

[Chorus]
Lookin' up more than I look down
The view's a whole lot better second time around
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground

[Outro]
Lookin' up
Lookin' up
Lookin' up
Lookin' up

[Verse 1]
If you're not the one for me
Then how come I can bring you to your knees?
If you're not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
Oh honey, if I’m not the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through?

[Pre-Chorus]
It's so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

[Chorus]
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

[Verse 2]
What are you waiting for?
You never seem to make it through the door
And who are you hiding from?
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
Have I ever asked for much?
The only thing that I want is your love

[Chorus]
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

[Pre-Chorus]
It's so cold in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

[Chorus]
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge

[Outro]
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge (Say it ain't so, say it ain't so)
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge (Say it ain't so, say it ain't so)
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

[Intro]
Just the guitar?
Okay, cool

[Verse 1]
This was all you, none of it me
You put your hands on, on my body and told me
Mmm, told me you were ready
For the big one, for the big jump
I'd be your last love, everlasting, you and me
Mmm, that was what you told me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free

[Chorus]
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

[Verse 2]
I was too strong, you were trembling
You couldn't handle the hot heat rising (rising)
Mmm, baby, I'm still rising
I was running, you were walking
You couldn't keep up, you were falling down (down)
Mmm, there's only one way down

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free, oh

[Chorus]
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

[Bridge]
If you're ready, if you're ready
If you're ready, I am ready
If you're ready, if you're ready
We both know we ain't kids no more
No, we ain't kids no more

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free

[Chorus]
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

[Outro]
If you're ready, if you're ready
(Send my love to your new lover)
If you're ready, are you ready?
(Treat her better)
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
If you're ready, if you're ready
(Send my love to your new lover)
If you're ready, are you ready?
(Treat her better)
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

[Verse 1]
Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that I moved on
That I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young
But my heart is a valley, it's so shallow and manmade
I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake
Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch
But I know that's just me 'cause nothing ever is enough
When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea
There was something in the water, now that something's in me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river

[Chorus]
But, it's in my roots, in my veins
In my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
Oh, it's in my roots, in my veins
In my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
So, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea

[Verse 2]
I should probably tell you now before it's way too late
That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face
Consider this my apology, I know it's years in advance
But, I would rather say it now in case I never get the chance

[Pre-Chorus]
No, I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river

[Chorus]
But, it's in my roots, in my veins
In my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
Oh, it's in my roots, in my veins
In my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
So, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
So, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea

[Outro]
River Lea, River Lea
River Lea
The River Lea-ea-ea
The River Lea-ea-ea
The River Lea-ea-ea

[Produced by Greg Kurstin]

[Verse 1]
I only wanted to have fun
Learning to fly, learning to run
I let my heart decide the way
When I was young
Deep down, I must have always known
That this would be inevitable
To earn my stripes, I'd have to pay
And bare my soul

[Chorus 1]
I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes, I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago

[Verse 2]
When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day

[Chorus 2]
I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes, I just feel it's only me
Who never became who they thought they'd be
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago

[Outro]
A million years ago

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
With your loving, there ain't nothing that I can't adore
The way I'm running with you, honey
Means we can break every law
I find it funny that you're the only one I never looked for
There is something in your loving that tears down my walls

[Pre-Chorus]
I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to

[Chorus]
The sweetest devotion
Hit me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I know

[Verse 2]
I'll forever be whatever you want me to be
I'll go under and all over for your clarity
When you wonder if I'm gonna lose my way home
Just remember, that come whatever, I'll be yours all along

[Pre-Chorus]
I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to

[Chorus]
The sweetest devotion
Hit me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I know

[Bridge]
I've been looking for you, baby
In every face that I've ever known
And there is something 'bout the way you love me
That finally feels like home
You're my light, you're my darkness
You're the right kind of madness
You're my hope, you're my despair
You're my scope of everything, everywhere

[Chorus]
The sweetest devotion
Hit me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I know

[Outro]
Sweetest, it's the sweetest
Sweetest, it's the sweetest
Sweetest, it's the sweetest
Sweetest, it's the sweetest devotion

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Life was great, wouldn't change a thing
I had it all, but with you I had more
But out of nowhere, out of the blue
Our love turned into a war
Now you're gone, you moved on
And I hate the way I'm feeling

[Chorus]
Now the only way I know that I can get you off my mind
To keep a bottle so close, try to leave it all behind
And I couldn't get enough
Girl, I'm drowning, drunk in love
I used to think you'd never say it's over
I used to love you sober
I used to love you sober

[Verse 2]
I'm on the floor, cursing at the door
Broken hearted with a pounding head
And I know, I gotta let you go
So the liquor helps me forget
Your name, your face
This pain I can't erase

[Chorus]
Now the only way I know that I can get you off my mind
To keep a bottle so close, try to leave it all behind
And I couldn't get enough
Girl, I'm drowning, drunk in love
I used to think you'd never say it's over
I used to love you sober
I used to love you sober

[Bridge]
Now you're gone
You moved on
And I hate the way I'm feeling...

[Chorus]
Now the only way I know that I can get you off my mind
To keep a bottle so close, try to leave it all behind
And I couldn't get enough
Girl, I'm drowning, drunk in love
I used to think you'd never say it's over
I used to love you sober
I used to love you sober

[Verse 1]
Madeleine
What's up with those tears in your eyes
What happened when you shut down
And all the amber lights turned into red
In the silence of your cave, you feel safe
You decorate it with velvet drapes
Outside you see the dark woods
But you don't know there's fields of gold ahead

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold on, don't let go
Hold on, you'll know
Help is on its way

[Chorus]
Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The sun will come out again
Rise up, rise up, rise up, Madeleine
The summer will come and
Kiss you with honesty
Love you unconditionally
Trust you and let you breathe
Give you back your dignity
So rise up, rise up, rise and live again
Cause only you can Madeleine
Oh Madeleine

[Verse 2]
Remember when
We used to sit and watch from the bridge
And wonder where the ships would go
Who was on and what they would find out
And you put it in a notebook
And said someday that this would be a story to tell
And you'd put it in a movie
Maybe be the Movie star
Something stole your tears and wiped your smile away

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold on, don't let go
Hold on, you'll know
That help is on its way

[Chorus]

Let the sunshine warm your heart today
So rise up, rise up, rise up Madeleine

[Chorus]

Oh Madeleine
Oh Madeleine

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
You keep playin games with me that's not coasta
Instead of blessin me now like you supposed ta
You take me aboard love roller coasta
Trying to get off when your on like Oprah girl
That's a negative
Like a pessimist
You say it ain't love
I say yes it is
Well I'm guessing this
The big question is
Why you sending me all these mixed messages
I know you're sleeping by now
But I'm still up walking around
The walls of my skull bend backwards
And in like a labyrinth

And I knew I was wasting my time
Keep myself awake at night
'Cause whenever I close my eyes
I'm chasing your tail lights
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark

And I know you left hours ago
I still haven't moved yet
I knew you were gone months ago
But I can't think of anyone else

I should have said something, something, something
But I couldn't find something to say
So I just said nothing, nothing, nothing
Sat and watched you drive away
And I just let the parking lot swallow me up
Choking your tires, and kicking up dust
Asking aloud why you're leaving
But the pavement won't answer me

And I just let the silence swallow me up
The ring in my ears tastes like blood
Asking aloud why you're leaving
But the pavement won't answer me

And I know I meant nothing, nothing to you
But I thought I meant something, something, something
But I just said nothing, said nothing, said nothing
Sat and watched you drive away

Oh I just said nothing, said nothing, said nothing
I can't think of anyone, anyone else
I can't think of anyone, anyone else
I can't think of anyone, anyone else
I can't think of anyone, anyone else
No, I won't think of anyone else

[Hook x2]
Picture me
Put a frame on me, nigga
Cookin' plenty deep
I got them bails, and don't call unless you want more than three
Said I got free bricks, but right now, ain't nothin' for free
Ain't scared of shit, nigga, you can buy this shit from me

[Verse 1]
Have you seen pics of me recently?
Bad bitch, ain't reachin' me
Takin' pictures in decent Lee's
Photo shoot in my Bentley G
Better yet, Bentley SUV
I'm straightforward, Ima straight 8
Wanna suck this dick? Bitch go for it
I'mma dog this nigga my hoe loyal
Got bands on me, I play, bruh
All my cars, they paid for
That pussy good, I pay for
She so fine, that I stay for
Crazy nigga I wanna rape her
And
My dick she say she got a taste for
And this paper add to my flavor
You broke, man, you ugly
You up, nigga, you handsome
Picture this — a little jail cell — then went and jumped in my V12
Money so old, it get senile
Got yo baby momma on redial
Get ten bricks for seventeen, that's why the bird is my decal
(Wop)

[Hook x2]
Picture me
Put a frame on me, nigga
Cookin' plenty deep
I got them bails, and don't call unless you want more than three
Said I got free bricks, but right now, ain't nothin' for free
Ain't scared of shit, nigga, you can buy this shit from me

[Verse 2]
Sayin' somethin', I'mma lay someone
I'mma send some for my income
I don't even know the outcome
But I'mma ride around with my drum
You can send some, but I'mma send some
But the ones I'mma send gon' hit somethin'
If you hit one,  you might get some
If you don't hit none, you don't get shit
Picture me as a Watcher, nigga
Picture me as a Mocker, nigga
Picture me as a Green Bay Packer stackin' up this paper, nigga
Save that "it get greater later", but I hate a motherfuckin' hater, nigga
It's dinner at this restaurant, but I split yo fuckin' potato, nigga
If he wants it, then I'm comin'
The police can't even save you, nigga
Goin' 100 miles and runnin', like Eazy-E in Compton, nigga
You suckas sayin' you gonna do somethin'
You bitches ain't gonna do nothin', nigga
I'mma tell Waka to trap him, and I'mma cut his ass like a pumpkin, nigga
(Wop)

[Hook]
Picture me
Put a frame on me, nigga
Cookin' plenty deep
I got them bails, and don't call unless you want more than three
Said I got free bricks, but right now, ain't nothin' for free
Ain't scared of shit, nigga, you can buy this shit from me

[Chorus]
Mother may I
Oh, mother may I
I wanna go outside tonight
Tell me it's alright
Mother may I

[Verse 1]
Mommy just listen
Something in the wind keeps calling me
And I'm old enough now to answer
I want everything that’s mine
Give it all to me I need your, your blessing
Cause your baby was born to be out of control
It'll help me make it home safely
But I'm still not sure If I wanna live to be old

[Chorus]
Mother may I
Oh, mother may I
I wanna go outside tonight
Tell me it's alright
Mother may I

[Verse 2]
Now mommy I know you're watching
I've been a good boy, I'll never bring you shame
I'll never know all your secrets
But it's impossible for us not to be the same
Now I've got one chance
To do whatever it is I'm supposed to do
When you think I'm ready
Please make sure that I come back home with you
Oh

[Chorus]
Mother may I
Oh, mother may I
I wanna go outside tonight
Tell me it's alright
Mother may I
Mother may I

[Bridge]
One way you can show you really love me
Just to let me go
But make sure that you tell my heavenly father
I said hello

[Chorus]
Mother may I
Oh, mother may I
I wanna go outside tonight
Tell me it's alright
Mother may I
Mother may I
Oh, mother may I
Say I wanna be alive tonight
Tell me it's alright
Mother may I

[Verse 1]
It's too hard to sleep
I got the sheets on the floor, nothing on me
And I can't take it no more, it's 100 degrees
I got one foot out the door, where are my keys?
'Cause I gotta leave
In the back of the cab
I tipped the driver 'head of time, get me there fast
I got your body on my mind, I want it bad
Oh just the thought of you gets me so high, so high (Woo!)

[Chorus]
Oh, you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl, you got me
There's nothing I, oh, I wouldn't do, wouldn't do
Just to get up next to you
Oh, you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl, you got me
There's nothing I, oh, I wouldn't do, wouldn't do
Just to get up next to you
Just to get up next to you

[Verse 2]
You open the door
Wearing nothing but a smile down to the floor
And you whisper in my ear, "Baby, I'm yours"
Oh, just the thought of you gets me so high (So high), so high (Woo!)

[Chorus]
Oh, you're the one I want to want me
And if you want me, girl, you got me
There's nothing I, oh, I wouldn't do, wouldn't do
Just to get up next to you

[Intro]
Thugga, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't move without my gun, yeah
And it's 'cause I'm the one
She wanna fuck my charms
Hell yeah

[Chorus]
But I never told her that I wanna be with her
And I never told her that I wanna sleep with her
And I never told her that she gonna eat with me
Only thing I told the girl is she could bleed with me
If she don't like it she don't see it
And she soft I call her Tempur-Pedic
And I can work magic like a genie
You can have my son, no Phoenix

[Verse 1]
Ayy, lil' momma showing me she don't play
And she never diss her old boy, no way
And I never told her nothing 'bout bae
And every time I leave she want me to stay
But she just don't know how to say
And that's deep but I could say
Anything I want, I run the day, whoa
Hand her my taste, cum on her face
Drank all her waste, okay, mush it not beat it
Hakuna Matata I need it, I am a Mufasa genius
Baby come fuck for no reason
I am the opposite, I'm so the opposite B
I'm the opposite baby
I know some Haitians and they cookin' babies, um, ayy
I meet the momma and meet the grandmomma when I wanna fuck the lil' lady
She ran my water then cook all my food now I feel like I done fucked a waiter

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't move without my girl, yeah
And it's 'cause I'm the one
She wanna fuck my charms
Hell yeah

[Chorus]
But I never told her that I wanna be with her
And I never told her that I wanna sleep with her
And I never told her that she gonna eat with me
Only thing I told the girl is she could bleed with me
If she don't like it she don't see it
And she soft I call her Tempur-Pedic
And I can work magic like a genie
You can have my son no Phoenix

[Verse 2]
Started from the top then I fucked her little bottom
I'ma nut on her booty she a Prada
I'm on her institution now I got on my goggles
Baby girl get on my boat no Nautica, whoa
Grab that dick eight fucking ways like a motherfuckin' octopus
I'ma fuck that lil' bitch and listen to 2Pac
Call the lil' bitty bitch when I wanna do her
Baby girl I'm hood rich and I put my crew up
Leave that bitch in a ditch and they wanna sue us
She's a barber, the bitch saying her crew cut
Put my dog in your poo butt
Laying down law with my Russians
No stomach, came out the gutter
Where the hell I'll be without my baby
When she send me pictures everything's the latest
I wanna fuck her without raping
And she'll pull up on you, no baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't move without my gun, yeah
And it's 'cause I'm the one
She wanna fuck my charms
Hell yeah

[Chorus]
But I never told her that I wanna be with her
And I never told her that I wanna sleep with her
And I never told her that she gonna eat with me
Only thing I told the girl is she could bleed with me
If she don't like it she don't see it
And she soft I call her Tempur-Pedic
And I can work magic like a genie
You can have my son no Phoenix

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Weezy f baby

See I was built for this shit
And now im riding around the city with a pretty young hottie
And size of the whip look like a human being body

Piss a gallon on a bitch

Trying to stack a lot of chips
Whenever the hate come I pack mo clips
It ain't nothing for me to mac a chick
But I ain't like that homie you can keep that trick
See im money over bitches for real
Yall trickin and lickin

Still riding through the hood
Smoke blunts with my niggas and bitches

Chi town what up your boy ain't left

Plus that cranberry range so sick

Im beefing with a chick
My ex old lady
Always tryna fight a nigga when she see me in the club
Starting to get sick of it, thinking bout calling the polices
On this crazy make em put her in them cuffs
Why? Cause ive had enough of that broad
She won't learn her lesson until she end up in the cop car
Yeah but I don’t want to take it that far
But I know she sue me if she end up with a cracked jaw
Maine said her that will back her up
My mom said point her out she will smack her up
Truth be told I guess im with her
Talking all this shit I will probably end up right back with her

[Chorus: Mack Maine]
Ratatat tat tat tat on you dog hoes
Ratatat tat tat tat on you dog hoes

Trendsetter Six! (Gangsta!)

Shoutout to Willie the Kid!
DJ Drama fuck these niggas up!

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
My time piece custom
Tennis shoes custom
90 bricks just passed customs
I ain't even touched 'em, may not even bust 'em
Any rapper challenge me, verbal race dust 'em
I guess you not accustomed
You got on a costume, acting like a ba-boon
Slap you with a barstool, like 4-Set rush him
Everybody jumped him
Gucci Mane so bossed up don't make me get to hush him
God can only judge me, Lord can only judge him
He don't have a pulse so guess somebody stuck him
Gucci got a fly mouth, somebody punch 'em
Last nigga tried that head look like a pumpkin
I don't give a fuck if you fucks don't give a fuck

[Chorus]
How many cars do you got? (A lot)
How many times have you popped ya Glock? (A lot)
How many times have you cruised the block? (A lot)
How many haters do you think I got? (A lot)
How many times am I talked about? (A lot)
How much money do you think I got? (A lot)
How many more men might get shot? (A lot)
How many more men might get shot? (A lot)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Gucci got an arsenal
Heard he ride with carbon-15s with grenade launchers on 'em
Tech nine with the cool it on it
If you wanna take it off me, I'll put all my jewelry on it
Take it, Fuck, Replace it, Ain't no need to put insurance on it
Homie got an eye problem, momma need insurance on him
Like my nigga Waka Flocka, don't wanna bag of money
Sniper rifle shoot yo pussy ass from around the corner
I be riding in my Lamborghini ('Ghini) sexing women
Thinking back, when I was in cutlass with no air condition
This track is a car collision
Think I got a heart condition
Clique got so much jewelry on, leave yo ass with blurry vision
Honestly, I pay so much money I can't wear True Religion
Y'all niggas be truly snitching
Stop asking 'bout Uncle Russel
You niggas no competition
It's Gucci, it's Gucci

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Gucci Mane phenomenon
Napkins with three numbers on 'em
Fucking with a rubber on
Yellow lamb, yellow blunt
Me and Monnie got a blunt
You and rats don't get along
No you cannot have a loan right now 'cause I'm never home
Pictures on my camera phone, make a nigga wanna rap
Wanna be like Gucci Mane, Wanna live off in the trap
No this ain't the life until you think before you enter
Hungry ass a nigga had the singles out in Libra
Make you a believer when you see me with the eagle
Street sweeper shootin' people 'cause they think they deeper
Deeper then this rap shit dead people can't type
Blind mind can't see Gucci knock your head off out

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Who taught you to breathe, then took away your speech
Made you feel so loved, then shook your hand with gloves?
You watched her pass away the words she said weren’t faint
Closed our eyes for a while, but I still see Sandra’s smile

[Chorus]
Can you see it in my face?
Had enough for today
It's hard for me to to stay in place unless I force myself awake

[Verse 2]
Look, an hour ago, I read Sybrina’s quote
Why should she forgive?
D’we lose you if, we don’t?

[Chorus x2]
Can you see it in my face?
Had enough for today
It's hard for me to to stay in place unless I force myself awake

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
I met this girl, named Nicki
I guess you could say, she was the rap queen
I met her in the studio lobby
But her booty look bigger in the magazines
She said, "Bey, would you jump in this song of mine?"
How could I resist?
When I heard little Nicki rhyme

[Verse 1]
You a rap star, pull your chain out
You a dope boy, pull the brick out
Say it again, money pull the whip out
Say it again, pussy bring a bitch out
I'm the shit you smell through the ziplock
At the strip club you bout to throw you rent out
Got you whole family livin' in a penthouse
You livin' like you trynna get kicked out

[Hook]
I hit the game like a dope'd up needle uh
I hit the game like a dope'd up needle uh

[Verse 2]
I ain't tippin' these bitches too busy tippin' the scale
Not a few real niggas don't mind sittin' in jail
Gotta healthy bitch grillin fish with the kale
Told a bitch that ain't me, you better fry me some shit

If your bitch got a booty, better squeeze it
I catch her slippin' and i'ma put her on her PJ
Yeah, I drop a album just cause
Put my shit in rotation, if it's love
I got chinchillas I don’t even wear
Keep the old hundreds and the new ones seperated
She gave me brain, she ain't wastin' education
She gave me head, then I asked "wait where you headed?"
I hit the game like a dope'd up needle
You fuck with niggas,who fuck you but won't feed you
I hit the game like a dope'd up needle
I'm in the game, I'm the coach and a player nigga

[Bridge]
You can ask your momma, your daddy, your auntie, your favorite rapppers, favorite rapper. I remind them and them niggas that used to pull up in a Benz or the Porsche, hoppin' out with the birds and the diamonds on.  Yeah I’m cut from that cloth

[Verse 4]
I hit the game like a dope'd up needle
My first hundred K gave me a seizure
I'm in your veins like a dope'd up needle
Yeah yeah, shootin' dope now you finished
Keep your bitch dope'd up, keep my bitch on dope
All that dope said she love, she spend the brick on the clothes
I told my bitch you better go on and fuckin' whip it
When they play my shit in the club uh, rub your titties
I'm doin' cardio nigga I run the city
Married to the game VVS is on my ring finger
Money talk what it say, I'm made it
Diamonds keepin' pupils dilated
She a queen you ain't know she a fiend huh
She the baddest, she ain't know she a addict yeah
She gettin' money, she ain't know she a junkie tho
All these bitches want is dope, yo

[Hook]
I hit the game like a dope'd up needle uh

Well, here I am
Take me
Look in my eyes
You'll see the soul
Underneath my celebrity skin
I'm not afraid
To open up wider
Please be my guest and come on in
You'll feel right at home
Inside my song
Shelter from the stormy weather
Body and soul, body and soul
Blood will bring it all together
I'm going to lift it up
And lift it off
Higher
Don't depend on luck
I'm driven by what I desire
I'm going to live it up
And lift it off
Higher
Don't depend on luck
Be driven by what you desire

[Chorus: Stresmatic]
Powder on my clothes
Always in the kitchen with pots on the stove
By next summer I will have a Range Rover
My money, it grows and it grows and it grows and it grows and it grows
Powder on my clothes
Always in the kitchen with pots on the stove
By next summer I will have a Range Rover
My money, it grows and it grows and it grows and it grows and it grows

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Bitch nigga
Lemme show y'all what I’m great at
East Side Long Beach, nigga where they say that?
Spray that, old school just like an ADAT
Doggie where you weigh that, homie don’t play that
More fresh powder
Scram, blood, blam on your clam chowder
Easy easy deezy show you how to
Flip a brick in half, stuff it in the chicken bag
Another hundred million smiling with my crippin' ass
Rock it up and go, I let it marinate
I came back to the city, just to share the cake
Lil' homies ready, y'all lock and load
Beast city in the crippin' kitchen

[Chorus: Stresmatic]
Powder on my clothes
Always in the kitchen with pots on the stove

By next summer I will have a Range Rover
My money, it grows and it grows and it grows and it grows and it grows

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
1989, when I was on the grind getting mine
6-1 block, East Side was the line
I had to have heart, nigga couldn’t punk out
You was training boys in the hood, nigga you jumped out
Scary ass busta, I get money with the hustlas
The Rugers, the main streets, the 6-0’s, the 8 Trey Gangstas
Popped at Piru’s and I cruise and I choose cause I paid my dues
Squeezing on these foo’s, but back to the money cause my homie need a new pair of shoes
Point made, close call
This is the life and time of the homie big Snoop Dogg

[Chorus: Stresmatic]
Powder on my clothes
Always in the kitchen with pots on the stove
By next summer I will have a Range Rover
My money, it grows and it grows and it grows and it grows and it grows
Powder on my clothes
Always in the kitchen with pots on the stove
By next summer I will have a Range Rover
My money, it grows and it grows and it grows and it grows and it grows

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
So much weight up in the bag that when you carry it, it break a shoulder
Bitch I put the cocaina back in Coca cola
Local distribution best make sure you grab the cargo’s
It’s Godfather Busta Remo, it’s General Nargos
I stash this money and coka in congos
I even ship the coke in instruments, stuff ‘em in bongos
We getting money like out of this cosmos
Pushing white down the 405 like OJ in the Bronco
We getting money, purchase diamonds straight out of the Congo
From cutting coke with my Colombian connect Alonzo
Pass the weed and let me roll a fronto
Bitch just brush this powder off my clothes and do it pronto

[Chorus: Stresmatic]
Powder on my clothes
Always in the kitchen with pots on the stove
By next summer I will have a Range Rover
My money, it grows and it grows and it grows and it grows and it grows
Powder on my clothes
Always in the kitchen with pots on the stove
By next summer I will have a Range Rover
My money, it grows and it grows and it grows and it grows and it grows

And then I let Uber get her home
Same shit, new day (Woo)
New bitch, new brain (Woo)

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
Don't make a nigga hit you with the switch up
You know what I'm on when I hit you
Been a real nigga, I don't switch up
Dick up in her, make her get the hiccups
When her man call, she don't pick up
I ain't even worried 'bout it
Baby let's try a new position
Elbows to her knees like a sit-up
New ocean, new wave (Ocean, new wave)
New bitch, new day (New bitch, new day)
New Ghost, new Wraith (New Ghost, new Wraith)
Lights down, no way
I'ma have to hit you with the switch up
Switch up, switch up, switch up

[Chorus: R. Kelly & Jeremih]

Guess I gotta hit you with the switch up
(Guess I, guess I gotta hit you, hey, switch up)
Call now, now then pick up (Brrt)
I'm about to hit you with the switch up (Switch up)
You done got way too comfy, babe
Girl you ain't the only one that want me
Hit you with the switch up (Hey)
I'm about to hit you with that switch up
I'm about to hit you with the switch up
Baby watch me switch up

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Pull up in the car with the lid up
Pull up with a broad and she did up
Pull her out the car if she spit up
Take her ass home, eat her clit up
Body like a pinup, I hit it with my chin up
Tell her call a friend up, and if she acts stuck up
There's plenty fish in the sea with their fin up
Then I gotta hit her with the switch up
I got another bitch comin', gotta clean up
But if pinched up is how a nigga end up
You know I make sure I hit her with the prenup
I got styrofoam cups, she got D-cups
She call me every day tryna re-up
I just cut on R. Kelly and I put it in her belly
And I gotta switch up, no re-runs, Tunechi

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
We been here before (We been here before)
Same shit, new day (Same shit, new day)
Same drama anyway (Same drama anyway)
Baby ain't shit changed (Got way shit changed)
Guess I gotta hit you with the switch up (Switch up)
Switch up, switch up, switch up, switch up
Guess I, guess I gotta hit you with the switch up (Switch up)
Switch up, switch up, switch up, switch up
Call now, now then pick up (Brrt)
I'm about to hit you with the switch up (Switch up)
You done got way too comfy, babe
Girl you ain't the only one that want me
Hit you with the switch up
I'm about to hit you with that switch up
I'm about to hit you with the switch up
Baby watch me switch up
Do you think that there's a way I could ever get too far
That you'd ask me where I'd been
Like I ask you where you are?
But I know you're in the pews
The same as stools around the bar
And I know I saw your hand
When I went out and wrapped my car
Streetlamp
Around the streetlamp

So I wrote you love letters
And sung them in my house
And all around the South
The broken strings and amplifiers scream with holy noise
In hopes to draw you out
But if no one sings along in praise
Are you still proud when I open my mouth?

Come visit me
Come visit me
In the back of an ambulance
A saline communion that I held like a séance on the blacktop
The devil in my arms says feed me to the wolves tonight
And come visit me
In the back of an ambulance
And a saline communion that I held like a séance
The low, electric glow – static snows in the lobby
Dull TV, magazines, waiting rooms can't hide me
From the sting, paper sheets, bloodwork and the IV
And the whirring machines while the nurses reassure me:
This will be quick and easy, I'm not gonna feel a thing
Lie and say it'll be alright, like a stray falling asleep
'Cause I'm so good at hurting myself

Pulse is slow, faint metronome on my left side
Beneath my protruding spine
You can hardly hear at night
White flag, blindfold covering my sunken eyes
And a line of rifles aimed at my sick mind

'Cause I'm so good at hurting myself
Let me pick through the empty dirt
And the rotten wood and the shoddy work
'Cause I'm interested
And our carpenter is so elegant
At placing splinters right beneath my nails
Where I cannot dig them out
But the same briars from your ribs
Are the tinder in my father's house

And I know
I know
I know
I know
I know myself better than anybody else
And you're gonna run

You're gonna run when you find out who I am
I know I'm a pile of filthy wreckage
You will wish you'd never touched
But you're gonna run when you find out who I am
Yeah, you're gonna run
You're gonna run, it's alright, everybody does
You're gonna run, it's alright, everybody does
You're gonna run, it's alright, everybody does
All of my friends, a plastic bag
Walking around, jumping the train tracks
Over the fence, veins all black
Sleep on a bench in the park
On my birthday
Call the blue lights
Cursed your name
When I find I'm still awake

Give me everything good, and I'll throw it away
I wish I could quit but I can't stand the shakes
Choking to smoke, or singing your praise
But I think there's a God and He hears either way
When I rejoice
And complain
I never know what to say

But I think there's a God and He hears either way
When I rejoice
And complain
Lift my voice
That I was made
And somebody's listening at night
With the ghosts of my friends when I pray
Asking "Why did you let them leave
And then make me stay?"
Know my name
And all of my hideous mistakes
I rejoice
I rejoice
I rejoice
I rejoice
Tell me in thin paper about your love
Breath like thick water lives in my lungs
My skin is full of black ink, in your white clothes
For so much I think, little I know

Pull off my armor, knees bruised and naked
Peel back my skin, call out my name
Vessel of brightness, come make me blind
This present darkness is swallowed by light

And my skeleton is a house for my eyes
Purchased with a bleeding side

[Verse 1]
Sickness in my heart
Sickness in my head
Sickness telling me
"No sickness in death"
Stuck on the refrain
"I want to be well"
Sickness can't afford
What the hopeful sell
They come down

[Chorus]
Ooh
How can I reconcile the seed
Once sown but never grown in me?

[Verse 2]
When the sullen seed
Fails to germinate
Must resist the need
To self-terminate
Bury my cold bones
In a forest bed
No soil in the grave
Pit of my stomach
Where nothing grows

[Chorus 2]
Ooh
How can i reconcile the seed
Once sown but never grown in me?
How can I reconcile the seed
Twice sown but never grown in me?

[Verse 3]
Guess this is where the
Resolution goes
But how can i resolve
What I do not know
Let me not inject
Lies into my end
But leave a question
Tucked in my amen:
Will I always be broken?
Broken

[Intro: Young Thug]
Yeah, ayy
Drinkin' color purple, ceiling color purple, ridin' color purple
What? What?

[Chorus: Young Thug & Rich Homie Quan]
Hey, Oprah Winfrey bring me that color purple

[Verse 1: Young Thug & Rich Homie Quan]
Drinkin' color purple, smokin' color purple

Which one you workin', what you sellin'? I'ma purchase
I am never earthin', ballin' like I'm nerfin'
Man I shoot that nig in person
Killin' what you worthin'
Break in baby purses
Draped in clothes like some curtains
Oh, lil' boo says "oh"
I'll bite you soon when I get home

Take off while sippin' on champagne
Oh, these bitches all like my domain
Hey, hey, oh

[Verse 2: Young Thug & Rich Homie Quan]
Keep me ridin' in it, I could whip a belly too big for a loaf
Purple with the Remy, fuck her in the rental and it never comin' off
All my cars are tinted, you can't see what's in it then I'm ridin' off
Presidential lil' skeet all in her mouth
Why your bitch gets one look, leach on a nigga, boss
Why the hell the lil' bitch wanna bring two bihs to daddy house?
Do the lil' bitch wanna play games? I'ma make her say "wow"
Lil' destiny, no child
Ayy, your music so chow
I'm purple just like a flower
I'm only purple just like a flower
I got front coach, so I come with towels

[Chorus: Young Thug & Rich Homie Quan]
Hey, Oprah Winfrey bring me that color purple
Ayy, Danny Glover bring me that color purple
Oh, double cup fill it up with color purple
Color purple
Bring that color purple, color purple, color purple
Bring that color purple
That color purple, bring that color purple
Bring that color purple, color purple, color purple

[Verse 1]
Subjected to my system
Reflecting on the days
When we used to be just friends
Protected both our interest
Our trust was in a bank
That's where our hearts were safe

[Pre-Chorus]
And then we got closer
Separated from my ex
So we got closer
Oh, in every visit
Feelings got stronger
Now this is out our hands
Our love is here to stay

[Chorus]
So get used to me checking in
All day
Get used to me falling through
Just to see your face
There ain't a moment
I won't need your brace
Get used to me touching you
Get used to me loving you
Oh get used to it, eh
Oh get used to it, eh
Oh get used to it, oh and oh
Get used to me holding you
Get used to me woeing you
Oh get used to it

[Verse 2]
And I'ma April shower you
Forever if I May
'Til your flowers bloom in June
Make sure that our fireworks
Be your 4th of July
For life
As long as you stand right by my side

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep growing closer
Throughout October
Oh counting down, it's almost Christmas Eve
Oh seven days shy of New Year's Eve
Then we'll be celebrating

[Chorus]
So get used to me checking in
All day
Get used to me falling through
Just to see your face
There ain't a moment
I won't need your brace
Get used to me touching you
Get used to me loving you
Oh get used to it, eh
Oh get used to it, eh
Oh get used to it, oh and oh
Get used to me holding you
Get used to me woeing you
Oh get used to it

[Bridge]
I ain't going nowhere
I ain't going nowhere, oh no
I ain't going nowhere
I ain't going nowhere, oh no
Put your faith in me
I'll be all you need, I swear
Yeah yeah
I'm gonna be right here, yeah

[Chorus]
So get used to me checking in
All day
Get used to me falling through
Just to see your face
There ain't a moment
I won't need your brace
Get used to me touching you
Get used to me loving you
Oh get used to it, eh
Oh get used to it, eh
Oh get used to it, oh and oh
Get used to me holding you
Get used to me woeing you
Oh get used to it

[Vamp]
I know you getting used to it
I know you getting used to it
(Get used to it)
I know you getting used to it
I know you getting used to it
(Oh get used to it)

[Hook 2x]
Got my feet kicked up and my top kicked back
Smoking thrax in the back with your girl, what you say about that
If you ever run up, get your wig pushed back
In the club on the trap, it’s a fact, what you say about that

[Verse 1]
Popped so many bottles, I should be a bartender
So much cash on me that I should be a money lender
Moved so many pounds, they think that I’m a bodybuilder
What I spent last night, I could’ve bought an Audi, nigga
Bet a hundred chickens I don’t get no recognition
But fuck some recognition, I just want them hundred chickens
Slapped the top of my new girl like I’m an Indian
My only wish is that them bricks go back to ten again
Wake up, couldn’t cake up, got a king size in my kitchen
Bad bitch, no make-up, neighbors minding their business
In the roof, long face up, in six days or you missing
Don’t pay up, won’t wake up, and leave you sleeping with the fishes

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
It’s a well known fact that I keep big straps
Got them things in my bookbag and I’ma bust back
When lil’ mama seen my watch, baby had a heart attack
Got a Ziploc full of mollies, I call it the party pack
I’m my own fan, I’ma meet myself, so much money, got to treat myself
Call me old school 

[?], put rims on then I called it a day
Heard that Gucci Mane and them getting money, got ten cars but the show want twenty
Rims so big but the top so skinny, stand next to me, yeah it’ll cost you twenty
Mind your business, don’t cost you any, hold on, wait one goddamn minute
Gucci Mane came in a drop top Bentley, switched up, came in a hard top Benzi
Cool as a fool but sure ain’t friendly, worth more than a pool with no goddamn diamonds
Won’t stop rapping ‘til a nigga start shining, 

[?] still trapping so a nigga still grinding

[Hook]

[Chorus]
Mark my words, that's all that I have
Mark my words, give you all I got
In every way I will
You're the only reason why
Oh I don't wanna live a lie
Mark my words
Mark my words

[Verse]
So you heard it all before
Falling in and out of trust
Trying to rekindle us
Only to lose yourself
But I won't let me lose you
And I won't let us just fade away
After all that we've been through
I'ma show you more than I ever could say

[Chorus]
Mark my words, that's all that I have
Mark my words, give you all I got
In every way I will
You're the only reason why
Oh I don't wanna live a lie
Mark my words
Mark my words

[Intro: Justin Bieber]
Happy birthday

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth'll make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary
Don't want us to lose what we are, no
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
If it ain't broke then we don't need to fix it
Believing in that she say'll have you livid
No they won't be happy 'til your love is over
They tryna break us up but you don't wanna get it
They ain't never had your back like I got it
They ain’t never had trust like how we got it
So they can't help but to come and hate on it
They see what we got and you know they want it
Don't question it

[Hook: Justin Bieber]
You ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth'll make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary
Don't want us to lose what we are, no
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
It's like you're always looking for a problem
But there ain't enough equations for you to solve 'em
So quick to turn nothin' right into somethin'
Take the numbers out my phone, go 'head and call 'em
They ain’t ever had my back like you got it
They ain't never had a chance, how you got it
So they can't help but to come and hate on it
They see what we got and you know they want it, don't question it

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth'll make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary (yeah)
Don't want us to lose what we are
(Don't wanna lose, no)
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are

[Verse 3: Nas]
She texts me "How's you love life?"
And "How are you?", I said "I'm good"
They only get as close as you allow them to
We should be closer together
Warm oceans, better weather
Instead of us playing games forever
She says whatever
I says whatever
Who get you wetter than the half moon wearer?
HSTRY sweater
Serendipity when you with me
Swear you love that one thing we did
That one time in that one place
Blew your mind, you got my mind gone when I'm home
I'm serious girl, a much older dude, a whole 42
I've accomplished my goals, it's only you
You and I in that Wraith, retired my pimp super-fly cape
Just my Mets cap and my batch and I'm straight
Esco

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You ain't gotta question it, oh
You already know the answer
The truth'll make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary, yeah
Don't want us to lose what we are
(Don't wanna lose, no)
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are

[Verse 1]
Feeling the reminisce
Gone in an instance
Blink of an eye
No goodbye
I had a notion
Deep as the ocean
Blue like the sky
Oh my

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a permanent stain
Wishing I could just wash away, away
Hate our love was in vein
But we're the blame
For all the pain
For all the pain

[Chorus]
If I would have known
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
(Woah, woah, woah)
If I had the chance
If I had the chance
I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be
Wanted to be
Your enemy, no, no
But if I
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
Been you

[Verse 2]
There repercussion
Of missing your loving
Haunts me at night
The ghosts are alive
All of the memories
Of serenity
Dwindle in my mind
All the time

[Pre-Chorus]
Like a permanent stain
Wishing I could just wash away, away
Hate our love was in vein
Who was to blame
For all the pain
For all the pain

[Chorus]
If I would have known
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
If I had a chance
If I had a chance
I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be
Wanted to be
Your enemy, no, no
But if I
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
Been you

[Break]

[Chorus]
If I would have known
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
If I had a chance
If I had a chance
I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be
Wanted to be
Your enemy, no, no
But if I
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
Been you

[Verse 1]
Feeling like I'm breathing my last breath
Feeling like I'm walking my last steps
Look at all of these tears I've wept
Look at all the promises that I've kept

[Pre-Chorus]
I put my all into your hands
Here's my soul to keep
I let you in with all that I can
You're not hard to reach

[Chorus]
And you bless me with the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose
Yeah, you've given me purpose

[Verse 2]
Thinking my journey's come to an end
Sending out a farewell to my friends, for inner peace
Ask you to forgive me for my sins, oh would you please?
I'm more than grateful for the time we spent, my spirit's at ease

[Pre-Chorus]
I put my heart into your hands
Learn the lessons you teach
No matter when, wherever I am
You're not hard to reach

[Chorus]
And you've given me the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose everyday
You give me purpose in every way

[Bridge]
Oh, you are my everything
Oh, you are my everything

[Outro (Spoken)]
I don’t know if this is wrong, because someone else is telling me that it’s wrong. But I feel this so let me just like try my best not to let this happen again.  We weren’t necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions

You can’t be hard on yourself for it, these are the cards you were given so you have to understand that’s not who you are. You know you’re trying to be the best you can be, but that’s all you can do. If you don’t give it all you got, you’re only cheating yourself give it all you got but if it ends up happening, it ends up happening

That’s what happening with me, it’s like “God, I’m giving it all I’ve got, sometimes I’m weak and I’m going to do it.” And it’s like I’m not giving myself grace, I’m just like understanding that’s how it is

[Chorus]
Can we, we keep
Keep each other company?
Maybe we, can be
Be each other's company
Oh company

[Verse 1]
Let's end each other's lonely nights
Be each other's paradise
Need a picture for my frame
Someone to share my reign
Tell me what you wanna drink
I'll tell you what I got in mind
Oh, I don't know your name
But I feel like that's gonna change

[Pre-Chorus]
You ain't gotta be my lover
For you to call me baby
Never been about no pressure
Ain't that serious

[Chorus]
Can we, we keep
Keep each other company? (Oh)
Maybe we, can be
Be each other's company
Oh company

[Post-Chorus]
Oooooooooh
Oooooooooh
Oooooooooh
Oooooooooh

[Verse 2]
It ain't about the complications
I'm all about the elevation
We can keep it goin' up
Oh, don't miss out on us
Just wanna have a conversation
Forget about the obligations
Maybe we can stay in touch
Oh that ain't doin' too much

[Pre-Chorus]
You ain't gotta be my lover
For me to call you baby
Never been about no pressure
Ain't that serious, no

[Chorus]
Can we, we keep
Keep each other company?
Maybe we, can be
Be each other's company
Oh company

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah yeah
Oooooooooooh
Oooooooooooh
Oooooooooooh
Oooooooooooh

[Chorus]
Can we be, can we be
Be each other's company?
Be each other's company (Oh)
Just be each other's company
Be each others company (Oh, oh-oh-oh)
Can we, we keep
Keep each other company? (Oh)
Maybe we, can be
Be each other's company
Oh company

[Verse 1]
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well I ain't

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Verse 2]
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Bridge]
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
You are to me
A part of me just like anatomy
You're pulling me
You're pulling me in like you're gravity

[Refrain: Justin Bieber]
I'm notorious for thinking you're full of beautiful
Instead of hollow
Sugar on your lips, it starts to kill
Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow

[Chorus: Justin Bieber + Halsey]
Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
I'm trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
But sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head and I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
You give to me
Everything, anything that I could dream
And at least that's what it seems
Could it be I don't know what's good for me?

[Refrain: Justin Bieber]
I'm notorious for thinking you're full of beautiful
Instead of hollow
Sugar on your lips, it starts to kill
Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow

[Chorus: Justin Bieber + Halsey]
Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
I'm trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
But sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head and I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
I'm sinking faster and faster
Between heaven and disaster
Sorry if I make you feel like
I'm standing on the borderline

[Chorus: Justin Bieber + Halsey]
Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
I'm trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
But sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head and I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?

[Verse 1]
My life is a movie and everyone's watching
So let's get to the good part and past all the nonsense

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing
When the pressure's coming down like lightning
It's like they want me to be perfect
When they don't even know that I'm hurting

[Chorus]
Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me, but you never will
There's one thing that I know for sure
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you

[Verse 2]
I've got to learn things, learn them the hard way
Got to see what it feels like, no matter what they say

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing
When the pressure's coming down like lightning
It's like they want me to be perfect
When they don't even know that I'm hurting

[Chorus]
Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me, but you never will
There's one thing that I know for sure
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me, but you never will
There's one thing that I know for sure

[Outro: Acoustic]
I'll show you
I'll show you

[Verse 1: Sia]
I was bound, was tied
Hadn’t seen the light so long
Thought I lost my fight
Couldn’t find my way back home
And I found the light stepping out of me
I was bound, and tied
Waiting for daylight and I…

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
Bang my head against the wall
Though I feel light headed, now I know I will not fall
I will rise above it all
Found what I was searching for
Though I feel light headed
I should have failed, and nailed the floor
Instead I rose above it all

[Chorus: Sia]
Oh, oh, oh
Bang my head against the wall
Oh, oh, oh
(Bang my head against the wall)
(Bang my head against the wall)
(Bang my head against the wall)
(Bang my head against the wall)

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
(ZooVier, 1738)
I been climbing up the wall, going through it all, baby
It’s so hard to live your life when you gave it up, baby
For the fans and the cameras
Different places, adventures
And the stress that it brings, start to wonder if it’s worth it
I live life like it’s perfect
My children are smiling and that makes me happy
Cause how I was living, I swear it had me
Bouncing my head off the wall
I came too far up, I cannot fall
Having fun, I don’t know about y'all
It’s ZooVier from ZooGang, I’m the boss
For my kids, give my life with no thought

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]
Bang your head against the wall
You may feel light headed, but you won’t crawl, no, you won’t fall
You will rise above it all
You’ll find what you’re searching for
And you may feel light headed
You think you’re gonna hit the floor
Instead you rise above it all

[Chorus: Sia]
Oh, oh, oh
Bang your head against the wall
Oh, oh, oh
(Bang my head against the wall)
(Bang my head against the wall)
(Bang my head against the wall)
(Bang my head against the wall)
(Bang my head against the wall)

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
I went to the moped store with shoppers
Salesman's like, "What up, what's your budget?"
And I'm like, "Honestly, I don't know nothing about mopeds."
He said, "I got the one for you, follow me."
Ooh, it's too real
Chromed out mirror, I don't need a windshield
Banana seat, a canopy on two wheels
Eight hundred cash, that's a hell of a deal

[Interlude 1: Grandmaster Caz, Kool Moe Dee & Melle Mel]
I'm headed Downtown, cruising through the alley
Tip-toeing in the street like ballet
Pulled up, moped to the valet
Whitewalls on the wheels like mayonnaise
Dope, my crew is ill, and all we need is two good wheels
Got gas in the tank, cash in the bank
And a bad little mama with her *** in my face
I'mma lick that, stick that, break her off, Kit-Kat
Snuck her in backstage, you don't need a wristband
Dope

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
Killing the game, 'bout to catch a body
Passed the Harley, Dukie on the Ducati
Timbaland, Khaled, Scott Storch, Birdman
Goddamn, man, everybody got Bugattis
But I'mma keep it hella 1987
Head into the dealership and drop a stack and cop a Kawasaki
I'm stunting on everybody, hella raw, pass the Wasabi
I'm so low that my cajones almost dragging up on the concrete
My seat is leather, alright, I'm lying, it's pleather
But girl, we could still ride together
You don't need an Uber, you don't need a cab
Forget a bus pass, you got a moped man
She got 1988 Mariah Carey hair
Very rare, mom jeans on her derrière
Throwing up the West Side as we tear in the air
Stop by Pike Place, throwing fish to a player

[Hook: Eric Nally]
Downtown, downtown (Downtown)
Downtown, downtown (Downtown)
She has her arms around your waist
With a balance that will keep her safe
(Downtown)
Have you ever felt the warm embrace
(Downtown)
Of the leather seat between your legs?
(Hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey)
(Hey-ey-ey-ey, hey-ey-ey-ey)
Downtown
You don't want no beef, boy
Know I run the streets, boy
Better follow me towards
Downtown
What you see is what you get, girl
Don't ever forget, girl
Ain't seen nothing yet until you're
Downtown

[Interlude 2: Grandmaster Caz, Kool Moe Dee & Melle Mel]
Dope
Cut the bull
Get off my mullet
Stone washed, so raw
Moped like a bullet
You can't catch me
A po-po can't reprimand me
I'm in a B-Boy stance, I'm not dancing
I got your girl on the back going tandem
Cause I'm too damn quick, I'm too damn slick
Whole downtown yelling out, "Who that is?"

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
It's me, the M, the A-C, the K
Sounding like a French pimp from back in the day
I take her to Pend Oreille and I water skate
I mean, water ski, ollie ollie oxen free
I'm perusing down fourth and they watching me
I do a headstand, the eagle lands on my seat
Well hello, but baby, the kickstand ain't free
Now do you or do you not wanna ride with me
I got one girl, I got two wheels
She a big girl, that ain't a big deal
I like a big girl, I like 'em sassy
Going down the backstreet listening to Blackstreet
Running around the whole town
Neighbors yelling at me like, "You need to slow down!"
"Going thirty-eight, Dan, chill yourself out!
Mow your damn lawn and sit the hell down!"
If I only had one helmet I would give it to you, give it to you
Cruising down Broadway, girl, what a wonderful view, wonderful view
There's layers to this ish player, tiramisu, tiramisu
Let my coat-tail drag but I ain't tearing my suit, tearing my suit

[Hook: Eric Nally]
Downtown, downtown (Downtown)
Downtown, downtown
She has her arms around your waist
With a balance that will keep her safe
(Downtown)
Have you ever felt the warm embrace
(Downtown)
Of the leather seat between your legs?
Downtown
You don't want no beef, boy
Know I run the streets, boy
Better follow me towards
Downtown
What you see is what you get, girl
Don't ever forget, girl
Ain't seen nothing yet until you're

[Outro: Eric Nally]
You don't want no beef, boy
Know I run the streets, boy
Better follow me towards
Downtown
What you see is what you get, girl
Don't ever forget, girl
Ain't seen nothing yet until you're
Downtown

[Corey Holcomb]
Man, you ain't been in here that long. Your perm still new. So, anyways. You know what I'm sayin'? We had some strippers. They let us do everything we wanted to do, touch anything we wanted to touch. I was puttin' my finger in places, but my nail 'bout to fall off.

["These Walls"]

Hey, boy. By the time I got there, I was already two bottles and three pussies-deep. 

[Laughs]. You hear what I'm sayin'? It was on, boy. I was barely standin' up by the end of it. Aw, yeah, it was cool, man. We was gettin' down, havin' a good time, dancin', groovin'. Everything was smooth. They was showin' your boy love. 

[Laughs]. But somethin' was off. I knew somethin' was wrong, man. You know, you get that feelin' sometimes. Like, when a real, cute woman is showin' you genuine love. Ay, that ain't right. But that's when I saw Kendrick out there gettin' down wit' my lady. Man, I spent the night at her house and walked her daughter to school. You know, that means you obligated to me. But I wasn't trippin' too much, you know? Like I said, I was already three pussies-deep. You know, I got respect for your boy, Kendrick, a little bit. Yeah, everythin' was cool, man. Well, shit, man, ain't nobody told me.

["These Walls"]

[Corey Holcomb]
I got these cops runnin' up on me 'cause I hit the back of the goddamn cop car. It wasn't my fault. I'm all ready to kick it with K-Dot and them tenders, man, and these cops sweatin' me about hittin' the ass of the car, goddamnit. I told them I hit the ass. I don't give a fuck if it's a fly.

["These Walls"]

[Verse 1]
There's indication
That someone else is standing on the ground
Across the nation
There's always people trying to pull you down
Now is the time
For us to spend this evening close together
Deep in the night
We're holding on to someone else's dream
Girl, can't you see

[Chorus]
We need some starlight, starlight sun
There ain't no second chance
We got to make it while we can
You'll need the starlight, some starlight sun
I need you by my side you give me
Starlight, starlight, starlight, yeah

[Verse 2]
They're out to get you
There ain't no issue you're acting like a fool
Love can possess you
And make you see that heart is gonna move
High in the night
This magic's gonna keep us close together, yeah
We'll start to fly
'Cause this is the beginning of your life
Baby, tonight

[Chorus 2]
Give me some starlight, starlight sun
With this, the only chance
We've got to make it while we can
You'll need the starlight, starlight sun
I need you by my side so give me
Starlight, starlight, starlight

[Bridge]
Light up the world, let the love start take charge of this masquerade
Take your delivery and show me that this is no lie
Give me your starlight tonight

[Verse 1]
There's indication
That someone else is standing on the ground
Across the nation
There's always people trying to pull you down
Now is the time
For us to spend this evening close together
Deep in the night
We're holding on to someone else's dream
Girl, can't you see

[Chorus]
We need some starlight, starlight sun
There ain't no second chance
We've got to make it while we can
You'll need the starlight, starlight sun

[Outro]
Give me, give me that sun

[Intro]
What do you mean it's not like that?
Oh, you're sorry?
Well, where are you now that I need you?
But girl, let me tell you something

[Chorus]
I know you called him on his cell phone
When you couldn't reach my love
Called him on his cell phone
When you couldn't reach my love
I know when that hotline bling
I'm sure I'm not your only fling
I know when that hotline bling
I'm sure I'm not your only fling

[Verse 1]
Every time I leave the city you
Been hangin' out with him like I don't know
Stay away from places that we always go
Tellin' him that we don't even talk no more
Every time he leave the city, you
Try to run game on me like it's just us
But I seen you in a Snapchat on his tour bus
When you hit my line, it don't mean that much

[Chorus]
I know you called him on his cell phone
When you couldn't reach my love
Called him on his cell phone
When you couldn't reach my love
I know when that hotline blings
Sure I'm not your only flame
I know when that hotline blings
Sure I'm not your only flame

[Verse 2]
Every time I leave the city you, you, you
Tell me where he like to shop when you're up under him
Said you're lyin' 'bout being with your girlfriends
When you take advantage of me bein' absent
Take advantage, yeah
And I really tried taking you serious baby, it’s really your loss
You had the chance being the only girl livin' in my heart and cross
Wanted to hold you down for a while, keep you smiling, no matter the cost
Would I double cross?

[Chorus]
We could be talking on my cell phone
Right now when you need my love
Lose the number to my cell phone
Cause you don't really care about my love
Call me on that hotline bling
If you wanna be with me
Call me on that hotline bling, right now
If you wanna be with me

[Intro]
I don't wanna do it, I don't wanna do it
Stay down, I don't wanna do it

[Hook]
If I had a chance to live my life over
I probably wouldn't do it (You know I wouldn't do it)
Cause I'd have been through it (I know I've been through it)
I probably wouldn't even do it (I probably wouldn't do it)
If I had a chance to live my life over
I probably wouldn't do it (damn)
Cause I'd have been through it (for real)
I probably wouldn't even do it
If I had a chance to live my life sober
I probably wouldn't do it
Cause I don't wanna do it
I swear that I'd have been through it

[Verse 1]
My mama raised one hell of a soldier
I don't see my son like I'm 'posed to
He see me on the TVs and posters
I tell my mama that I wish we were closer
And if you run up on Wop I'ma smoke ya
I'm like no main man still ain't got closure
The game changed got me in a folder
I'm trying to sell more chickens than Kroger
My big dope boy knots in my britches
But I just still get back in the trenches
A little kid big wishes for Christmas
Only thing that I got was some wishes
Only thing she gave me was Swishers
And god knows I miss grandma kisses
And my uncle in need of a kidney
My first cousin turned out to a sissy
My auntie an army girl in the damn service
I throw the pistol like I'm in the damn service
He pulled the pistol out on a man, he got nervous
And he don't really want to do it cause he lack courage

[Hook]
If I had a chance to live my life over
I probably wouldn't do it
Cause I'd have been through it
I probably wouldn't even do it
If I had a chance to live my life over
I probably wouldn't do it
Cause I'd have been through it
I probably wouldn't even do it
If I had a chance to live my life sober
I probably wouldn't do it
Cause I don't wanna do it
I swear that I'd have been through it

[Verse: Eminem]
You know it's devil's night
The way that I smash the face of a punk in
Mask of Jason is a fashion statement since Drunken
Master tapes been a basket case
And if that's the case, then I'm dunkin'
Fascination with masturbation and humpin'
Lacerations and masking tape
And I'm bumpin' some Masta Ace
Roll up posin' as pastor Mase at a luncheon
See Andrea Yates, grab her face, then I'm punchin'
Crack her fuckin' skull with an antique vase, kill her husband
To the back of the station wagon
She's dragged and placed in the trunk and
Now I'm wanted for kidnappin', rape, and abduction
Spread her legs like Land O'Lakes that I'm cuttin'
'Til every fuckin' limb's either amputated or punctured
Decapitated Christina Applegate and I rap like I'm agitated
No chill, but I'm half sedated
A functioning addict — wait, I'm in London?
Brains underwear? A pantywaist, classic case of disfunction
Aggravated assault, it was rap related, you activated a gunman
This game's over-saturated with junk and
You punks couldn't get a hit from a database with a thumbprint
Razors and matches, path is laid for destruction
Put Jason Mraz's face in his ass
Then I'm snatchin' Anne Hathaway
She scratchin' like Jam Master Jay on the one's and
Two's, I slash away, then I'm dumpin'
Her ass in a Lake Placid for alligators
After I use the fuckin' tire thumper to bash her brains in for nothin'
The murder weapons, I stash 'em away on Runyon
Man, the kind of balls that it has to take and the gumption
Lack of class displayed, but such a vast array in abundance
Of sad disgraceful and bad distasteful redundance
And, bitch, I'm hung like candy canes if you're wonderin'
Balls come at you like batting cages
I'm raw like Big Daddy Kane is, I'm comin'
Like I'm ejaculatin' and nuttin'
Come catch the clap like you're patty-cakin', lil' dumplin'
Or brace yourself like a cast and be the last to make an assumption
I'm back like I'm in the bathroom takin' a dump and
It's back in the day or somethin'
I'll shit on you, Devil's Night — how's that for a introduction?

[Intro: Young Thug & Lil Uzi Vert]

If it came 'cross my table we dealt with it
I need me at least two like I'm stepping it
I'm so bool that these bitches are acceptin' it
I got bitches that been known the bando
I'll show niggas that's with it no blindfold
We the monsters, we slime, we not kind folk
We so cool with the dope, we want molto

I want ice in my teeth but no Coco
When I fuck her I perform the yoko

Finger lickin' nigga, quarter key
Your money small I call it shorter Gs
She up and down on it repeatedly
I fuck her hard, don't accept apologies
Baby gurgle, color purple
Dick need nursing, gotta burp her
40 pistols, niggas lurkin'
Top Shotta, kill my nigga
Never heard of, get to murkin'
Closed curtains, no outbursting
We real killers not no crowd bursters
Psych, bitch, I'm shootin' every person
Catalyst, catch the wrist
Rabbit shit, fuck your mix

Looking, smelling, talking, walking bricks

Moonrock come from Cali, coughing, shit
RIP to Paul Walker, shit

Even when it's rented, president tinted
I need an Aaliyah she gon' rock all on my boat
My chain small but only my weed make me choke
Hey come here baby girl I want that amateur throat
And when I get through I pass it to all of my folks
Damn they got my name on the Coke

Shoot dice nigga five deuce four tre
And my weed orange like a fuckin' cantaloupe
She fuck me then smile in your face, all she ever say is "Oh yeah"
Ooh baby girl, pull up and give top, no lotion, she like Olay
Hey I don't like 'em black, no spades, no way
And I only tell her to hurry and wait

Bitches comin' round the fuckin gangsta, think they stupid
Pull up in the trenches, smoking loud like a Dually
And I know I am the best, bitch, how you do this?
And I pulled up on your bitch early truancy
Damn what the fuck is going on, I am gone, so gone
I just spent a band on cologne, I am on, so on
And my neighbors call my thick misses Texas Roni
They was watchin' me back in the days like a Sony, promise
I just bought my son a Bentley for his 'port card
All my bitches coming foreign plus they head on
These lil' bitches tryna compete then they dead wrong
I'ma act just like I'm sleep but I'm dead on

[Chorus]
Woah, we tore up
I'm like baby don't throw up, if she ever hit the ground
Young Thug not pickin' her up, you can Quicker Picker Up
Cause I'm a blood, pass me my bup, tryna come around for help but you gon' (What?)
End up suckin', nothing but dick like woah
Baby girl gon' stay and drop it, no steps but I promise I go up

Fucked her in the deep end
That's some shit you gon' know about
Big B, Willy B, still smoking gas, eyes low as a Chinese
Still wearing flags, bitch I bleed 'til I'm deceased

Nigga tatted her with nut and she ain't sleeveless
She want every drop that come out a penis

He see me kickin' shit now he wanna sell me that moto
Plus he know I got stripes like Ocho Cinco
Yeah he know a nigga Lion-hearted, no Bengal
The world could think I'm dreaming but I swear to God he know
What your momma tell you about playing with that fire?
Didn't God tell you if you livin' you gon' die?
When you shot 'em up you know that pressure was applied
My nephew saw his daddy get sent out home to the sky
If you knew any better, he would've said "don't break rules"
If I didn't know better, I would've stayed in a school
If that bitch didn't know better, I would've played it in two
If I didn't know better, I would've crossed out God and went voodoo

[Chorus]
I need a freak
'Cause I'm a motherfucking beast
Yeah, I'm a motherfucking beast, nigga
I'm in the street, why?
'Cause I'm a motherfucking beast
I'm a motherfucking beast, nigga
Ah
I need a freak
'Cause I'm a motherfucking beast
Yeah, I'm a motherfucking beast, nigga
I'm in the street, why?
'Cause I'm a motherfucking beast
I'm a motherfucking beast, nigga

She got that head like a dyke
She got that head that I like
Deep in your partner ain't right
Put that lil' babe on ice
I make the paper like rice
Head on that bucket, your mothafuckin' life, Skoob
I promise you don't know me
I pull up 'bout my cake
Where I'm from is not safe
I got fish, I'm a lake
Scoop them grits on a plate
Yet she thought it was steak
I'm a thief in the night
Make her ride like a bike

[Verse 1: Young Thug & Trouble]
I go down on a dyke, I go up on my price
I might drop Kimbo Slice, kidnap like Uncle Ice
I got grits at the beach and they white like a rice
Let Trouble take your life
After I give you five
Straight put that five to the side
It ain't no question how nigga gon' ride
When they come with them questions
My nigga get quiet, sh sh, nigga sit quiet, sh sh
I am not taking no disrespect
You Patrick Ewing, you pump fakin'
No that won't happen on me
I drop a key like the mufuckin' beat
I look good as your dad on a Friday
So many cars I gotta buy a driveway
Never gon' let 'em live a nigga crime day
Serving these X and P's instead of poppin'
Pockets fat up like they jumped 'em
YSL, that slimy anaconda (Yeah)
Bicking back, being bool like a uncle (Yeah)
I'm so geeked up, I might fuck a condom

[Chorus: Trouble & Young Thug]
Like a thief in the night
I take anything but some pussy
She got that head like a dyke
She got that head that I like
Deep in your partner ain't right
Put that lil' babe on ice
I make the paper like Rice
Head on that bucket, your mothafuckin' life, Skoob
I promise you don't know me
I pull up 'bout my cake
Where I'm from is not safe
I got fish, I'm a lake
Scoop them grits on a plate
Yet she thought it was steak
I'm a thief in the night
Make her ride like a bike

[Verse 2: Trouble & Young Thug]
I get 'em all on the rice (On the rice)
She didn't even know what it was but she taste it
I dig in, her shit sound like Jason
I be on Percocets more than occasion
They betting on me like in Vegas
Betting on me like I'm Vegas
Stick to the code man, there won't be no trace
Thugga Thugga, tell me what would you say?
What would you say?
No J Money, but my gun say, "Bow"
Pop a molly, look at her then fiend
I'm the target mofucka, no beam
No this shit is not good as it seems
I might give her the boot with no jeans
I kick shit like a chong and a ching
I'm a boss, I'm 'bout that unity
Sandwiches, you know you in between
And you gotta know we at the green
You gotta be young nigga, wilder than Billie Jean
Gotta have paper for lawyer fees
You ain't with it, you a L
Still getting it, yeah, bails
Break it down on the scale
If it add up, hell yeah, I do it
Lap back as he ran to it

[Chorus: Trouble & Young Thug]
Like a thief in the night
I take anything but some pussy
She got that head like a dyke
She got that head that I like
Deep in your partner ain't right
Put that lil' babe on ice
I make the paper like Rice
Head on that bucket, your mothafuckin' life, Skoob
I promise you don't know me
I pull up 'bout my cake
Where I'm from is not safe
I got fish, I'm a lake
Scoop them grits on a plate
Yet she thought it was steak
I'm a thief in the night
Make her ride like a bike

Ooh, in front and back and make her double nut
Wrapped up in towel, got out my cat plug

When I do a video you get the popular role (woo)
In the V.I.P. they get a little lap dance
Come and grind on the willy of a black man
In my ear, telling me the shit a nigga like to hear
While I nibble on your nipple like Pac-Man

[Verse 4: Paul Wall & T-Pain]
It was love at first sight when I've seen that ass shaking
And 'bout fifty dollars later it was love in the making (I'm in love)
You simply won my heart when I saw the way you work that pole
And when you bent over you had my wallet in a choke hold (Ohh)
I saw you in your birthday suit and baby it was fate

You can call me the man of steel, cause that ass is just like a magnet
Damn! You got me so in love (love)

Cause I'm the first one in the front row when they make a stripper announcement
I think I'm falling in love with the one with the most ass
Thin, little bitty waist, I'm go and buy that bitch a Volkswagen
MJG, pimp tight, no mo' tipping stop the bill
If I come in here one more night I'm gonna need Dr. Phil
But I'm a G, I'll step back and tell them bitches outright
Ain't no way I can turn a stripper to a housewife

[Verse 7: Too $hort & T-Pain]
The last girl was pretty, but she wasn't fine as you
She was sexy but she couldn't do the things you do
She could dance but nothing like the way you move
I used to want her until the day I saw you
I'm a grown ass man I thought I'd seen it all
Doing all that on the pole and didn't even fall
And right then I knew exactly what it was (What's that?)
I wanna fuck the baddest bitch in the club

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm in love with a stripper
She really think I'm playing, I'm playing

But I love it

[Beat break]

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
And I know she'll be the death of me
At least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me
The worst is yet to come
All the misery was necessary when we're deep in love
This I know, girl, girl I know

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
She told me, "Don't worry about it"
She told me, "Don't worry no more"
We both know we can't go without it
She told me you'll never be alone, oh, oh

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it
(But I love it)
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it
(But I love it)
But I love it

[Beat break]

[Verse 1]
I know it's late, I know it's late

Wondering if the same old understanding, stands

[Indecipherable]

[Verse 1]
Turn your magic on, Umi, she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
And we are legends, every day
That's what she told me

[Verse 2]
Turn your magic on, to me she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds

[Chorus]
Now I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
And I feel my heart beating
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

[Post-Chorus]
Alive again
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

Said I can't go on, not in this way
I'm a dream that died by light of day
Gonna hold up half the sky and say
Only I own me

[Chorus]
Now I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
Oh, I can feel my heart beating
'Cause you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

[Post-Chorus]
Alive again
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

Turn your magic on, Umi, she'd say
Everything you want's a dream away
Under this pressure, under this weight
We are diamonds taking shape
We are diamonds taking shape
(Woo, woo)

[Bridge]
If we've only got this life
This adventure, oh then I
And if we've only got this life
You'll get me through
And if we've only got this life
In this adventure, oh then I
Want to share it with you
With you, with you
Yeah, I do

[Outro]

[Intro]
They turned me on...

[Verse 1]
I fell asleep in my clothes
Watching videos
I was up all night
I was too excited to go to sleep

When I was 9 years old
I watched Solid Gold
Everything was alright
Sure 'nough put something inside of me

[Chorus]
I was made in the 80s
I was made in the 80s

[Verse 2]
I heard the Culture Club
And I fell in love
They were singing to me
And Billy Idol was real rock 'n' roll
I loved Duran Duran
And did the Safety Dance
In front of my TV
And all the greatest songs are from Billy Joel

[Chorus]
We were made in the 80s
We were made in the 80s

[Verse 3]
Madonna was obscene
And Michael Jackson was King
And hair metal was God
The unofficial fifth member of the Mötley Crüe

RUN-D.M.C
Looked just like me
God bless your heart
I owe everything I am to all of you

[Chorus]
I was made in the 80s (ah yeah, ah right)
Made in the 80s (ah yeah, ah right)

[Outro]
Dance
Come on
Dance with me

[Verse 1]
Your picture is still on my wall, on my wall
The colors are bright, bright as ever

[Chorus 1]
Red is strong, but blue is true
Some things last a long time
Some things last a long time

[Verse 2]
Your picture is still on my wall, on my wall
I think about you often, often

[Chorus 2]
I can’t forget all the things we did
Some things last a long time
Some things last a long time

[Verse 3]
It’s funny, but it’s true
And it’s true, but it’s not funny

[Chorus 3]
Time comes and goes
All the while I still think about you
Some things last a long time

[Verse 4]
Your picture is still on my wall, on my wall
The colors are bright, bright as ever

[Chorus 4]
Things that we did are we forget
Some things last a long time
Some things last a long time

[Intro]
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart

[Chorus]
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart

[Verse 1]
I can't believe I forgot your name
Oh, baby, won't you cum again?
She said "I've got a problem with your shoes
And your tunes, but I might move in
And I thought that you were straight, now I'm wondering"

[Pre-Chorus]
You're so conceited, I said "I love you"
What does it matter if I lie to you?
I don't regret it, but I'm glad that we're through
So don't you tell me that you just don't get it
'Cause I know you do

[Chorus]
And I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart

[Verse 2]
It's not about reciprocation, it's just all about me
A sycophantic, prophetic, Socratic junkie wannabe
And there's so much skin to see
A simple Epicurean philosophy
Oh, and you say (You say) I'm such a cliché
I can't see the difference in it either way
And we left things to protect my mental health
But you'll call me when you're bored and you're playing with yourself

[Pre-Chorus]
You're so conceited, I said "I love you"
What does it matter if I lie to you?
I don't regret it but I'm glad that we're through
So don't you tell me that you just don't get it
'Cause I know you do

[Chorus]
I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart

[Outro]
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart
Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound
I know the sound of your heart

[Chorus]
Wake me up before you go, ooh, I need a little more
Just a little more, a little more of your love
Wake me up before you go, ooh, I need a little more
Just a little more, a little more of your love

[Verse 1]
Oh, I need a jumpstart, use my cable to plug into ya
Gimme a headstart, gonna have me like hallelujah
Even though I'm a man, girl, you making me feel like a baby
I just wanna lay in your arms, take advantage of the moment
'Cause the way you put it down is the definition of a real lady

[Pre-Chorus]
So before I go to work, can I ask you for a favor?

[Chorus]
Wake me up before you go, ooh, I need a little more
Just a little more, a little more of your love
Wake me up before you go, ooh, I need a little more
Just a little more, a little more of your love
'Cause your love, your love, your love
Wake me up with some more of your love
'Cause your love, your love, your love
Wake me up with some more of your love

[Verse 2]
Oh I need a back talk, ooh, I need some sex talk
Oh baby girl, you inspire me, give me the reason to keep going
Oh, sweet as a melody, girl you're the lyrics to my song
When you put that lip lock on me I don't think I can control it
I hold on with all my might while you look at me in my eyes
Like a vitamin, you put back my energy and making me stronger, bring out the best of me

[Pre-Chorus]
So before I go to work, can I ask you a favor?

[Chorus]
Wake me up before you go, ooh, I need a little more
Just a little more, a little more of your love
Wake me up before you go, ooh, I need a little more
Just a little more, a little more of your love
'Cause your love, your love, your love
Wake me up with some more of your love
'Cause your love, your love, your love
Wake me up with some more of your love

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
Oh, angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink and love's a drug
Oh now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river dried up
You came to rain a flood

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin with Beyoncé]
You said drink from me, drink from me
When I was so thirsty
Poured on a symphony
Now I just can't get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I, oh-I, oh-I
Got me feeling drunk and high, so high, so high
Oh-I, oh-I, oh-I
Now I’m feeling drunk and high, so high, so high

[Verse 2: Chris Martin with Beyoncé]
Oh, angel sent from up above
I feel you coursing through my blood
Life is a drink and your love's about
To make the stars come out

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin with Beyoncé]
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Poured on a symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I, oh-I, oh-I
Got me feeling drunk and high, so high, so high
Oh-I, oh-I, oh-I
I’m feeling drunk and high, so high, so high

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, so high, so high
I, oh-I, oh-I
Now I'm feeling drunk and high, so high, so high

[Outro: Beyoncé  with Chris Martin]
That I shoot across the sky

Let me shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the...

I still don't believe you, you need more people

[Intro: Justin Bieber]
It don't make no sense 'less I'm doing it with you
It don't make no sense 'less I'm doing it with you

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
The sun don't set the same
'Less you're watching it go down with me
The bed won't sleep the same
'Less you're waking up in here with me
Oh, my heart's a vacant house
When you're gone away, it's so empty
And love don't make sense when it's empty (Oh no)

[Pre-Chorus]
I've driven almost every car
It ain't the same when I'm without you
Been around a million stars
None of them shine brighter than you
The sky be so dark now without you
Yeah, ooh, baby

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
Oh been around the world
Ain't the same without you
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Focus ain't the same
If the picture ain't got you in it
In every line my
Emotions ain't the same
If it ain't about you, I don't get it
Ever since the beginning now
You had that effect on me
All I wanna do is you, oh
I mean that so literally
Don't nobody go harder than you
All of the angels must be lonely now, without you, woah

[Chorus: Justin Bieber (Travis Scott)]
It don't make sense, no
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
'Less I'm doing it with you baby
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
I only want to hear your voice, yeah
Oh, been around the world
Ain't the same without you
Had to find out the hard way
It don't make sense, no
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
(Going way up, way up)
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
(Way up, way up, way up)
(Yeah, slow down stay up, stay up, stay up)
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you

[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
Time and time again I break a plan
Without you, girl I ain't the man
Could never be all I can be
You overstand, I'm incomplete
Apparently, gotta know I hate that
How I'm supposed to take that?
Boo'd up, missing all of that
Gotta be laying in that
Rolled up, put a flame to that
Thought by now you would have made it back
Be patient
Won't you pull up to me now?
Live forever young
It’s amazing
I don't want to sleep 'less you at home

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
It don't make sense, no
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
No, It don't make sense
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
No, it don't make sense
It don't make sense
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
(Alright, yeah, alright)

[Verse]
For you I was a flame
Love is a losing game
Five story fire as you came
Love is a losing game
One I wish I never played
Oh what a mess we made
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game
Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand
Self professed, profound
'Til the chips were down
Know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand
And though I batted blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love is a fate resigned
Over futile odds
And laughed at by the gods
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game

[Intro]
Guiding star, shining down on me
Destiny, it's my destiny
To laugh and cry and live and die
Graciously

[Verse 1]
I've been thinking bout it lately
Trying to find a way to live forever
Now wouldn't that be amazing
But don't you ever say never
Say I wanna be wild and I wanna be free
Knowing that nothing is promised to me
It feels even better than your favorite sin
To dance like somebody is watching

[Chorus]
Tonight, I'm living the dream
And I know what it means
Tonight, we're dancing all over the world
And everybody is a star
Yes we are

[Verse 2]
Oh good lord, I'm ready
Ready to get to move it
I wanna do something
Something that's worth doing
I wanna be wild, I wanna be free
Knowing that nothing is promised to me
It feels even better than your favorite sin
To dance like somebody is watching

[Chorus]

[Bridge x2]
Why waste your time waiting on forever
I say forever can wait
Live in the moment as long as you own it
Forever may be too late

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Hmm, I'm feeling something, something different
When you left, the picture changed
I was blinded, I'd not envisioned
The same face in a different frame

[Pre-Chorus]
It's an omen, caught my baby crying
Saw the silver lining
It must be an omen
Needed you to show me
Without you I am lonely

[Chorus]
My mind would rule my heart
I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
It left me torn apart
But now I see your tears as an omen

[Refrain]
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Omen
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Omen

[Verse 2]
You were waiting, I was vacant
You left before my eyes
Then it hit me, you're relocating
And I need you by my side

[Pre-Chorus]
It's an omen, caught my baby crying
Saw the silver lining
It must be an omen
Needed you to show me
Without you I am lonely

[Chorus]
My mind would rule my heart
I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
It left me torn apart
But now I see your tears as an omen

[Outro]
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Omen, oh
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Omen, oh
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Omen, oh
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Omen

[Verse 1: Sam Smith]
Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand
But I still need love cause I'm just a man
These nights never seem to go to plan
I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
Oh won't you stay with me?
Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
Why am I so emotional?
This is not a good look, gain some self control
And deep down I know this never works
But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Oh won't you stay with me?
Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
Oh won't you stay with me?

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
Oh won't you stay with me?
Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

[Chorus: Sam Smith & (Mary J. Blige)]
Oh won't you stay with me?
(Won't you stay? Won't you stay?)
Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
(This ain't love, no, no, no)
But darling, stay with me

[Verse 1]
Take a walk
Before it gets dark
Little angel
There's no need to worry
Shouldn't be too painful
At last, I see the roses
West bound on a cold train
I'm headed home for the closing

[Verse 2]
Take a walk
Before it gets dark
There's no need to worry
Shouldn't be too painful
At last, I see the roses
West bound on a cold train
I'm headed home for the closing

[Outro]
Drifting towards the ocean
Some place where I can lay my head down
Are closing

[Intro: Dr. Dre]

Unreleased! Brand new! (brand new!)
Dr. Dre! From the private stash!
Straight from the vault, turn yo radio up!
Only on the Pharmacy baby!
Yeah! Whooo!
Seige Monstracity, good lookin'!

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Red bottoms on a red head
Fake Molly, fed body
We get it poppin' when she at her best
Cause it’s a party when she 'bout it (come on!)
Shots dropping, now she out her dress
And girls coming out the closet (Beats 1!)
A superstar on some private shit

[Verse 2: Sly Piper]
Make a promise not to tell nobody
If she hot enough to get it, well get it girl
You know what it is, I don't get offended girl
(Sending this one out to all the excited dancers out there!)
(Geahhh! get ya money)
Come and kick it with a player, enjoy your world
You better open up, let me hit it and join your world
Like the ceiling, reveal it before I kill it
She tried to go tell the city I loved her but no, I didn't
I fucked her no, I didn't, get comfortable doe-eye dipping
Then wonder what she was feeling
Her number does not exist in my phone, and I overlooked her
Her friends were looking me over
And I ain’t got time for nothing
But you to come out them clothes and get naked

[Hook: Sly Piper]
She gon' do it all for a player like me
I bet if she could she would make it naughty
You know what she do when she hang around me
She like to get naked
She don't have to worry 'bout shit for one night
All because we know we only gettin' one life
Probably because her momma don't know what she like

[Outro: Dr. Dre (Marsha Ambrosius)]
Yeah, take it easy
Yeah, strip tease me
(Let's get naked)

[Intro]
Hey

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
Designer linens and a cuban cigar
Woke up out the dream
In the same place I left off
30 thousand feet at the peak
Of my jet log
Now if you look into my profile piece
You'll see the catalog
And that's better than the best of
Get what you earn now
Stand up for something
Or watch it burn down
My whole life I've been hustling
At least a third now
Should be good for something
Blessings upon it
Now watch it turn round

[Hook]
Hey, I got them turnips for the turn up
What a wonderful feeling
I bought the five for the burning
But it rolled the building
Now watch it burn down

But it rolled the building
Now watch it burn down
Watch it burn down
Burn down, burn down

[Verse 2: Ayomari]
Don't touch that dial, bout two notches from turn up-ville
This shit is real
Caught a flat
Chopping it up with this rap
By the bathroom
All this damn waiting
Could have been spent waiting for some loud juice
These clouds usually ain't so thick
But this shtick I'm on keep my hi-chews
See girl, jewelry
Ain't no perk but a booty be fooling with me
Could it be this turnip I turnt on
Following googly maps?
Could it be? Don't know
Just know my cuff low
So fill it up until I meet the brim
So I could sip it up until I meet my grim
Then then, yeah
Release the matches
Locked up in my pockets
Drag it against my jeans  and drop it
Let's see what happens

[Hook]
Hey, I got them turnips for the turn up
What a wonderful feeling
I bought the five for the burning
But it rolled the building
Now watch it burn down

Got them turnips for the turn up
What a wonderful feeling
I bought the five for the burning
But it rolled the building
Now watch it burn down
Watch it burn down
Burn down, burn down
Burn down, burn down

[Part 1: The Season]

[Produced by 9th Wonder]

[Hook]
My faith is buried somewhere underneath the town
(Until it’s paid for)
Strawberry season, my sweetheart is coming ‘round
(I hear it rain and pour)
How did you find me here? It must be perfect timing
(Forever grateful)
If I didn’t love you then, I damn sure love you now
(Fruit of your labor)

[Verse]
Say, ain’t shit change but the bank statements
Spent the summer in the wave with the beach babies
Threw your chula in the buggie
With the top down up the PCH
I’m heading north, I hope it doesn't rain
Went from playing community ball to balling with the majors
(Oh, what, you major?)
Yeah, nigga, I ran bases, pitch flame
I call plays, remove labels
And fuck fame, that killed all my favorite entertainers
(Nothing short of amazing, ooh, yeah)
But I’m short on my patience
Say, I don’t play that shit, I don’t ever forget
And don’t forget that dot, nigga, you paid for it
I spent years being called out my name
Living under my greatness
But what don’t kill me is motivation

[Hook]
My faith is buried somewhere underneath the town
(Until it’s paid for)
Strawberry season, my sweetheart is coming ‘round
(I hear it rain and pour)
How did you find me here? It must be perfect timing
(Forever grateful)
If I didn’t love you then, I damn sure love you now
(Fruit of your labor)

[Part 2: Carry Me]

[Produced by Callum Connor]

[Intro]
Yeah, say, yeah

[Hook]
Six years old, I tried my first pair of Jordans on
("Momma, can you carry me?")
It was late in the fall
I caught a glimpse of my first love, my God
("Momma, can you carry me?")
Knees hit the floor, screams to the Lord
Why they had to take my ma? ("Momma, carry me?")
To the early morn' ("Momma, can you carry me?")
To the early morning ("Momma, can you carry me?")

[Verse 1]
Hey, hey, hey, gather round, hustlers, that's if ya still livin'
And get on down before the judge give the sentence
A few more rounds before the feds come and get you
Is you gon' smile when your date gets issued?
You know them feds taking pictures
Your mom’s in prison, your father need a new kidney
You family’s splitting, rivalries between siblings
If cash ain’t king, it's damn sure the incentive
And good riddance

[Interlude]
"Is the element of danger an important factor for the members of your peer group?"
"Yes, you might say that. Why don’t you give it a try and find out for yourself?"

[Verse 2]
'Bout the year Drizzy and Cole dropped
Before K.Dot had it locked
I was sleeping on the floor, newborn baby boy
Tryna get my money pot so wifey wouldn’t get deported
Cursing the heavens, falling out of orbit
Tryna roll this seven, tryna up my portion
What about your goals? What about your leverage?
So they don’t force you into some hole
What’s the meaning of my fortune reading?
When I crack the cookie, all it said was “keep dreaming”
When I look at my tree, I see leaves missing
Generations of harsh living and addiction
I came to visit during the seven-year stint
But they wouldn’t let me in because my license suspended
Now I’m scraping the pennies just to kiss you on your cheek
It’s gonna be a couple weeks before I get it
I know you miss me

[Hook]
Six years old, I tried my first pair of Jordans on
(Momma, can you carry me?)
It was late in the fall
I caught a glimpse of my first love, my God
(Momma, can you carry me?)
Knees hit the floor, screams to the Lord
Why they had to take my ma? (Momma, carry me)
To the early morn' (Momma, can you carry me?)
To the early morning (Momma, can you carry me?)

[Break]
(Momma, can you carry me?)
(Momma, can you carry me?)
(Momma, can you carry me?)
(Momma, can you carry me?)

[Bridge]
Yeah, oh, oh, oh
And one of these is my rise
One of these is my downfall
And I’m the one to make it right
I wanna make it right, momma
And one of these is my rise
One of these is my downfall
And I’m the one to make it right
I wanna make it right, momma
I wanna make it right

[Outro]
(Momma, can you carry me?)
To the early morning
(Momma, can you carry me?)
To the early morning
(Momma, can you carry me?)
Oh, lord
(Momma, can you carry me?)
(Momma, can you carry me?)
(Momma, can you carry me?)
(Momma, can you carry me?)
(Momma, can you carry me?)

[Outro: Sample: Psychologist + Leroy the Masochist]
I, uh, see here they call you a masochist
I like pain
Can you be specific? What kind of pain do you like?
Any kind of pain

[Hook]
Rum-pum-pum-pum-pum
We are not the dumb ones
We see how the drugs run
We see were they come from
Governments are selling it
Every day one ton
They declared a war on drugs
But drugs won

[Verse 1]
Flashlights, canine dogs and crooked copper's
Automatics, tear gas, rams and helicopters
Off of marijuana, on the East Coast every year
While California selling that high grade everywhere
It's crazy how the East Coast considers herb the enemy
While every corner in LA is a dispensary
The country been split on this issue now for a century
Why would a natural harmless herb lead to a felony?
New York need to catch up
The pace need to pick it up
You know them prosecutors got big spliff litted up
Switch the philosophy think of the economy
Plants, herbs and roots are nature's technology

[Hook x2]
Rum-pum-pum-pum-pum
We are not the dumb ones
We see how the drugs run
We see were they come from
Governments are selling it
Every day one ton
They declared a war on drugs
But drugs won
Rum-pum-pum-pum-pum
We are not the dumb ones
We see how the drugs run
We see were they come from
Governments are selling it
Every day one ton
They declared a war on drugs
But drugs won

[Verse 2]
People taking risks
Cause they know that money gon' come
The drug game is global
Paying off twenty to one
Who you telling?
You don't think these politicians they selling?
Doctors ain't sellin', cops ain't sellin'
While rocking your melon?
Cop cars smelling like Cali blue dream
In New York brothers like "What do you mean?"
I mean switch the velocity
Think of the economy
Plants, herbs and roots are nature's technology

[Hook]
Rum-pum-pum-pum-pum
We are not the dumb ones
We see how the drugs run
We see were they come from
Governments are selling it
Every day one ton
They declared a war on drugs
But drugs won

[Verse 3]
Brothers on that lock down
Sisters in that lock up
Things were good in the hood
Till them D's popped up
Brothers getting shot up, cause the systems unjust
Segregated justice
It's just them and just us
Cops roam around like a gang trying to jump us
Into the plantation prisons they wanna dump us
Cause they're really prisons for the poor
It's about the money, not the drugs
That's what I'm getting handcuffed for
It ain't about the law, it ain't about the crime
Cause banks are paying fines for their crimes all the time
Huh it's a setup, switch the philosophy
Plants, herbs and roots are nature's technology

[Hook]
Rum-pum-pum-pum-pum
We are not the dumb ones
We see how the drugs run
We see were they come from
Governments are selling it
Every day one ton
They declared a war on drugs
But drugs won
Rum-pum-pum-pum-pum
We are not the dumb ones
We see how the drugs run
We see were they come from
Governments are selling it
Every day one ton
They declared a war on drugs
But drugs won

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
Fixing up a car, driving it again
Searching for the water, hoping for the rain
Up and up, up and up
Down upon the canvas, working meal to meal
Waiting for a chance to pick your orange field
Up and up, up and up
See a pearl form, a diamond in the rough
See a bird soaring high above the flood
It's in your blood, It's in your blood
Underneath the storm an umbrella is saying
Sitting with the poison takes away the pain
Up and up, up and up, it's saying

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
We’re gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We’re gonna get it, get it together I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
Lying in the gutter, aiming for the moon
Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon
Up and up, up and up
How come people suffer? How come people part?
How come people struggle? How come people break your heart?
Break your heart?
Yes I wanna grow, yes I want to feel
Yes I wanna know, show me how to heal it up
Heal it up
See the forest there in every seed
Angels in the marble waiting to be freed
Just need love, just need love
When the going is rough, saying

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
We’re gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We’re gonna get it, get it together I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go

[Bridge: Chris Martin]
And you can say what is, or fight for it
Close your mind or take a risk
You can say it’s mine and clench your fist
Or see each sunrise as a gift

[Guitar Solo 1: Jonny Buckland]

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
We’re gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We’re gonna get it, get it together I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and
We’re gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We’re gonna get it, get it together I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up

[Guitar Solo 2: Noel Gallagher]

[Interlude: Chris Martin]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, whoa, oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, whoa, oh

[Outro: Chris Martin]
Fixing up a car to drive in it again
When you’re in pain, when you think you’ve had enough
Don’t ever give up
Don't ever give up

[Coda: Annabelle Wallis]
Believe in love...

[Verse 1]
Love is in the air
Candles all around us
There's no need to see, nothing, nothing
Baby I'm yours, yours until forever
Cause you know that I would never ever want this to change

[Chorus]
It's all about the magic
All about the madness in your eyes
Madly in love, yeah
It's all about the magic
All about the madness in your eyes
Madly in love
Madly in love babe
Madly in love
(Madly in love)
(Madly in love)
(Madly in love)
Madly in love
(Madly in love)
(Madly in love)
(Madly in love)

[Verse 2]
Babe, you are the reason to breathe
And babe, you know you're all that I need
Remember when you took my hand
And ran away (it was just us two babe)
And wandered off to Chinatown
Laughing 'bout nothing at all
When I look into your eyes

[Chorus]
It's all about the magic
All about the madness in your eyes
Madly in love, yeah
It's all about the magic
All about the madness in your eyes
Madly in love
Madly in love babe
Madly in love
(Madly in love)
(Madly in love)
(Madly in love)
Madly in love
(Madly in love)
(Madly in love)
(Madly in love)

[Ambience]

[Verse]
Oh, I think I landed
In a world I hadn't seen
When I'm feeling ordinary
When I don't know what I mean
Oh, I think I landed
Where there are miracles at work
For the thirst and for the hunger
Come the conference of birds

[Chorus]
Saying it's true, it's not what it seems
Leave your broken windows open
And in the light just streams
And you get a head, a head full of dreams
You can see the change you wanted
Be what you want to be
And you get a head, a head full of dreams
Into life, I’ve just been spoken
With a head full, a head full of dreams

[Bridge]
Oh, I think I landed
Where there are miracles at work
When you got me open-handed
When you got me lost for words
I sing oh-oh-oh

[Outro]
A head full of dreams
A head full of dreams
Into life I’ve just been woken
With a head full, a head full of dreams

[Verse 1]
Been standing in the corner, studying the lights
The dreaming of escape will keep you up at night
But someone had put the flares up and got me in the rays
So I guess I’d better stay
‘Uh uh no come on’ you say

[Refrain 1]
It's a fools gold thunder
It's just a warring rain
Don't let the fears just start 'What if
I won’t see you again’
Around here you never want to sleep all night
So start falling in love, start the riot and

[Chorus 1]
Come on rage with me
We don’t need words
And we’ll be birds
Got to make our own key

[Verse 2]
Only got this moment
You and me
Guilty of nothing, but geography

[Refrain 2]
Come on and raise it
Come on and raise this noise for the million people
Who got not one voice
Come on it’s not over if you mean it, say loud
Come on all for love, out from the underground

[Chorus 2]
Away with me
We don’t need words
Close your eyes and see
And we'll be birds, flying free
Holding on in the mystery
Fearless, fearless, fearless

[Bridge]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Fearless together
You said ‘we’ll go through this together’

[Outro]
When you fly won’t you
Won’t you take me too?
In this world so cruel
I think you’re so cool

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I know it's over before she says
I know the falls that the water face
I know it's over, an ocean awaits for a storm
The sun on snow, rivers in rain
Crystal ball can foresee a change
And I know it's over, a parting of ways
And it's done

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]
But didn't we have fun?
Don't say it was all a waste
Didn't we have fun?
Oh-oooh-ooh

[Chorus 1: Chris Martin]
From the top of the world, top of the waves
We said forever, forever always
We could have been lost, we would have been saved
Oh, I
Now we're stopping the world, stopping its spin
But, come on, don't give up, don't say we give in
Don't say it's over, don't say we're done
Oh, didn't we have fun?
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh
Woo-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh, didn't we have fun?

[Verse 2: Chris Martin with Tove Lo]
I know it's over before she says
Know someone else has taken your place
"I know it's over," Icarus says to the Sun
The sword sinks in, lightning strikes
And two force, two forces collide
And fight til it's over, fight til it's done
Ah-ah-ah

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin with Tove Lo]
But didn't we have fun?
Don't say it was all a waste
Didn't we have fun?
Oh-oooh-ooh

[Chorus 2: Chris Martin & Tove Lo]
From the top of the world, top of the waves
We said forever, forever always
We could have been lost, we would have been saved
Oh, I
Now we're stopping the world, stopped it in its tracks
But nothing's too broken to find a way back
So before it's over, before you run
Ah, didn't we have fun?

[Bridge: Chris Martin with Tove Lo]
'Cause you and me
We were always meant to, always meant to be
We were always meant to, always meant to
You and me
We were always meant to, always meant to be

[Bridge: Chris Martin & Tove Lo]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, didn't we have fun?
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, didn't we have fun?

[Outro: Chris Martin & Tove Lo]
But didn't?
But then, maybe we could again

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse: Coleman Barks]
This being human is a guest house
Every morning a new arrival
A joy, a depression, a meanness
Some momentary awareness comes
As an unexpected visitor
Welcome and entertain them all!
Be grateful for whoever comes
Because each has been sent as a guide

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
Been around the world, the wonders to view
Been around the world, looking for someone like you
Pyramids try, Babylon too
But the beautifullest treasures lie in the deepest blue

[Chorus]
So I never say die, aim never untrue
I'm never so high as when I'm with you
And there isn't a fire that I wouldn't walk through
My army of one is gonna fight for you

[Verse 2]
Been around the world, universe too
I've been around flying, baby, there's nothing I wouldn't do
Tanzaku stars, lasso the moon
And be standing there beside you
Right when the storm comes through

[Chorus]
Cause I never say die, aim never untrue
Never so high as when I'm with you
And there isn't a fire that I wouldn't walk through
My army of one is gonna fight for you
My army of one is gonna fall for you, yeah

[Bridge]
Cause you reign
All cause you reign
All cause you reign
My army of one is gonna call it through

[Outro]
Saying my heart is my gun, army of one
Yeah my heart is my gun, army of one
It's my only weapon, army of one
Saying my heart is my gun, army of one

[Verse 1: Jay Sean]
Damn baby, this thing is on

You ain't gotta do nothing

Baby close your eyes
You can feel the air between your thighs

[Chorus: Nicki & Jay Sean]
Your love, your love (Yeah)
