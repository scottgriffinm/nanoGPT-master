ove, it was my place to scold him (A'ight)
Never told him nothin' wrong, kept it fair
Didn't listen, so I might as well have been talkin' to the air (Damn)
Everybody makes mistakes, a mistake is a'ight
But if it ain't, I'ma tell you straight, time to say goodnight
Nobody likes to be played, regardless of the relationship
But shorty's fuckin' up big time, I hate this shit I'm caught in the middle of havin' love for a lil nigga
And knowin' what's expected of me as a real nigga (Damn)
My next move is crucial, what do I do?
How do I keep it real with shorty and my crew?
Didn't wanna kill him, so instead of puttin' the MAC on him
I did the only thing I could do, turn my back on him

[Chorus]
Here we go again
Same old shit, dog, just a different day
Here we go again
You know how niggas do, when we play, how we play
Here we go again
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do
Here we go again
So if it's fuck me, nigga, then you know it's fuck you

[Verse 2]
Niggas that I fuck with wanna get him dead
But I'm cool with shorty's peoples, so I let him live
Under normal circumstances, he would be a marked man
But I hit him with a grand, just didn't shake his hand (Ooh)
Go about your business (Uh-huh), do what you gon' do (Uh)
Be what you gon' be, I wash my hands, I'm through (A'ight)
I can forgive, I just can't forget
You're on your own, little man, don't ask me for shit (No)
If you paid attention to what I taught you, then you good (Uh)
If I see you again, get it, understood?
Go 'head before I change my mind 'cause you know you should be dead
"I just wanted to say—," ah, go ahead
Instinct told me to kill him, but the savior is
I'm a good nigga, plus I owed his peeps a favor (Mmm)
But I also knew the decision I just made (Yeah)
Went against the rules of the game that we play (Damn)

[Chorus]
Here we go again
Same old shit, dog, just a different day
Here we go again
You know how niggas do, when we play, how we play
Here we go again
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do
Here we go again
So if it's fuck me, nigga, then you know it's fuck you

[Verse 3]
I should've followed my first instinct 'cause I knew (Right)
Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do (True)
Now this nigga's fuckin' with the competition (What)
Ungrateful motherfucker, should've got him missin' (What)
This nigga got the nerve to take my kindness for a weakness
Gots to get back on some street shit so I can creep this
Rat, when I act, take one, set him up
Take two, get him there, take three, get him done
Wasn't hard for me to get him where I wanted him, confronted him
Bzzt, click, there was a bullet in one of them
Feelin' lucky? Click, looks like you are
Click-click-click, luck ain't goin' too far (Uh)
What you did was put on another pair of shoes
And they just happened to be too big
What you did was stupid (Damn), real fuckin' stupid (A'ight)
Well, shorty, I gave you a chance and what did you do?
Threw it back in my fuckin' face, so fuck you too (A'ight)

[Chorus]
Here we go again
Same old shit, dog, just a different day
Here we go again
You know how niggas do, when we play, how we play
Here we go again
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do
Here we go again
So if it's fuck me, nigga, then you know it's fuck you
Here we go again
Same old shit, dog, just a different day
Here we go again
You know how niggas do, when we play, how we play
Here we go again
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do
Here we go again
So if it's fuck me, nigga, then you know it's fuck you

[Intro: Regina Bell harmonizing while DMX speaks]
What good is it for a man to gain the world
Yet lose his own soul in the process?
God loves you, yes he does, said you're alright with him
I wonder…

[Chorus: Regina Bell]
I know you've never seen him
But don't fight with him
You're gonna make it through the night
To the light with him
You're alright with him
I said you're alright with him
I know you've never seen him
But don't fight with him
You're gonna make it through the night
To the light with him
You're alright with him
I said you're alright with him

[Verse 1: DMX]
I'm callin' out to you, Lord, because I need your help
See, once again I'm havin' difficulty savin' myself
Behavin' myself, you told me what to do, and I do it
But every and now and then it gets a little harder to go through it
Losin' friends day by day
I'm in so much pain when I'm here, Lord, please take me away!
I put you here to do a job, and your work ain't done
To live is to suffer, but you're still my son
And there will be a time when you shine as bright as the stars
But there won't be a his or hers, just ours
Then you'll see what I've been tryin' to show you all these years
Do the right thing, 'cause after the tears come the cheers
I will, my Lord, with my heart and my soul
That's gonna be how I roll, from now until I mold
Lead and I'll follow, you take away the sorrow
I'ma sleep on what you said and holla back tomorrow

[Chorus: Regina Bell]
I know you've never seen him
But don't fight with him
You're gonna make it through the night
To the light with him
Uhh, you're alright with him
I said you're alright with him
I know you've never seen him
But don't fight with him
You're gonna make it through the night
To the light with him
Uhh, you're alright with him
I said you're alright with him

[Verse 2: DMX]
I want you to know, Lord, that for what you given me I'm thankful
Sincerely, from the bottom of my heart, I'm grateful
You gave us power in our words, so I think before I speak
And that way when I speak, they know I'm here to teach
Can't tell 'em nothin' wrong, 'cause I love 'em too much
I reach a lot of people, and Lord, I'm lovin' the touch
But deep inside, I've got somethin' that's workin' against
Everything I know is right, what I know makes sense
That's when you must fight harder than you've ever fought before
'Cause what you've got goin' on inside you is a war
Between good and evil, be careful of those who wanna be you
They smile but are not really happy when they see you
Be careful of the ones that always wanna get you high
'Cause when the time comes, that one'll let you die
Listen to me! I'm here, but I can only help you
If you want me to help, what do you want for yourself?

[Chorus: Regina Bell]
I know you've never seen him
But don't fight with him
You're gonna make it through the night
To the light with him
You're alright with him
I said you're alright with him
I know you've never seen him
But don't fight with him
You're gonna make it through the night
To the light with him
You're alright with him
I said you're alright with him

[Verse 3: DMX]
My Lord, my savior, don't judge my behavior, but instead
Take what's in my heart and put it in my head
See, I guess I really never knew how proud I made you
My life is yours, my soul I gave you
I don't know if I'll do good enough (He's by your side)
And we both know the hood is rough (Right by your side)
Sometimes I don't know what to do (X, dry your eyes!)
But I know what I gotta do (It'll be alright)
You keep givin' me the word, and I'll put it to song
Talk to me, I'll talk to them, and we can't go wrong
This is the start of somethin' strong, and this is just the start of it
Praises to you, my Lord, for lettin' me be a part of it
I was that kid that, been there, did that
Became ashamed so I hid that, but ain't no longer with that
Use me as an example—if I can do it, then they can too
With the Lord behind us, there ain't nothin' that we can't do

[Chorus: Regina Bell]
I know you've never seen him
But don't fight with him
You're gonna make it through the night
To the light with him (The light with him)
You're alright with him ('Cause he loves you)
I said you're alright with him
I know you've never seen him
But don't fight with him
You're gonna make it through the night
To the light with him
Uhh, you're alright with him ('Cause he loves you)
I said you're alright with him

[Outro: Regina Bell]
He's by your side
Right by your side
X, dry your eyes!
'Cause it'll be alright
Yeah, he's by your side
Right by your side
X, dry your eyes!
'Cause, it's gonna be alright
Yeah yeah, yes it is!

[Intro: DMX]
Grr

[Chorus: DMX]
I gots to make a move and make it soon, uh
I gots to take a block and make it boom
I take the car and hit it with this boom
Now come on, let's get that money

[Verse 1: DMX]
It's two o'clock and I'm just about to hit the street
'Til I knock off this rock, I don't get to eat
Sometimes that's like that's the only reason why I hustle
Step on toes, strong-arm and show a lil' muscle
Ain't no real dough, that's why a nigga feel so frustrated
I hate it, seein' crab niggas that made it
And I'm robbin' cats just as broke as myself
Livin' foul and ain't lookin out for my health, where's the wealth?
It ain't in New York, 'cause niggas talk about goin' out of state
Money got an eighth, comin' back hot with a lot of weight
Where's my plate, nigga? I'm hungry too
So I'ma do like hungry do and get a hungry crew
Niggas that ain't never had, and doin bad
Will be glad to get up off that stoop lookin' sad
Grab your bags, it's about to go down
We goin to this hicktown, let's get the lowdown, on how they get down

[Chorus: DMX]
I gots to make a move and make it soon, uh
I gots to take a block and make it boom
I take the car and hit it with this boom
Now come on, let's get that money
I gots to make a move and make it soon, uh
I gots to take a block and make it boom
I take the car and hit it with this boom
Now come on, let's get that money

[Verse 2: DMX]
I gots to make a move and make it soon
Gots to take a block and make it boom
We comin' through, so make some room
Found somethin' that could be somethin' if I pump it up
This kid Black is the only thing that could fuck it up
The purple top thirty-five smalls is ringin' bells
But I'ma crush him with the black 40 double-L's
I send two niggas back up top, and come back
We chop up rock, by midnight, we open up shop
It's four in the morning, we on the block creepin'
Killin' the cash, while yo' ass is sleepin'
Look here, I'm what they call a true hustler
'Cause, nigga, if I ain't know you since I was like six
Then I don't trust ya
And we'll bust ya over somethin petty like two dollars
Put somethin hot up in that ass and watch you holla (Ah)
You think I'm here for the ho flow? I want the dough flow
And fuck the po-po, nigga keep a .44

[Chorus: DMX]
I gots to make a move and make it soon, uh
I gots to take a block and make it boom
I take the car and hit it with this boom
Now come on, let's get that money
I gots to make a move and make it soon, uh
I gots to take a block and make it boom
I take the car and hit it with this boom
Now come on, let's get that money

[Verse 3: DMX]
I spend my money on niggas, 'cause niggas get me rich
And a bitch ain't doin' shit but suckin' my dick
Niggas is family now, and we stand strong
Thirty niggas over six blocks, makin' the cash long
Shit is good, because niggas gettin' what they been wantin'
And we see the same shit, other New York niggas frontin'
Stick up kids huntin', but I ain't got no love for 'em
I keep the burner and the duster with the glove for 'em
Them motherfuckin' knockers come at us and chop us
And I know they really tryin' to stop us and wanna drop us
So we pump from the alley, and the last house we use as a cash house
It's holdin' 'em strong, it's a stash house
I got runners that work for twelve hour shifts
And when them niggas keep they count correct, I don't riff
But I ain't tryin to hear that nigga took your pack shit
Ain't tryin to hear jack shit, you fucking black bitch
I ain't a greedy nigga, all I want is a five year run
If I don't make it, then fuck it, let me die near a gun
Got bitches to transport without an escort
I'm makin moves from D.C. up to Westport
Local police ain't a problem, 'cause they don't even stress us
It be them ATF niggas that have you under pressure
Just so you know, ain't gon' never put my Glock down (Why, nigga?)
'Cause I'm a hustlin' motherfucker, and I'm holdin' my block down

[Chorus: DMX]
I gots to make a move and make it soon, uh
I gots to take a block and make it boom
I take the car and hit it with this boom
Now come on, let's get that money
I gots to make a move and make it soon, uh
I gots to take a block and make it boom
I take the car and hit it with this boom
Now come on, let's get that money

[Intro]
Uh
This is life (This is life)
This is what I know (This what I know)
So to me (So to me)
This is life (This is life)

[Chorus]
One more road to cross
One more risk to take
Gotta live my life
Like there's one more move to make
One more road to cross
One more risk to take
Gotta live my life
Like there's one more move to make

[Verse 1]
I'm up at like 6 AM to check this nigga (Uh-huh)
He work the nightshift and I gots to check them figures (A'ight)
Knock on his door, peoples talkin' 'bout he ain't there
But the house is packed, shit, I know he here somewhere
See, money get high, I don't knock what a nigga do to get by
Just make sure you gettin' by don't fuck with you gettin' mine
Ain't the first time he ran off, shoulda split his shit then
Hate to think of what he's did and if I catch him slippin'
Won't be an ass-whippin', I can tell you that
I keep it real with this cat, he go and sell two packs
And run off (Damn), tell me he was locked down up North
And you out a week later? That's bullshit, I bust off
I need this dough, fuck you think, I'm here for my health?
I need this wealth because I feed myself
You play with my life when you play with my money
Played around, but this'll be the last time you think something's funny

[Chorus]
One more road to cross
One more risk to take
Gotta live my life
Like there's one more move to make
One more road to cross
One more risk to take
Gotta live my life
Like there's one more move to make

[Verse 2]
Yo, I've been casin' the liquor store for a month now
But me and two other niggas
Is about to run up in there and shut it down
They got four people on the inside, one stay in the back
Two stock boys, one at the register, but he count the stacks
A'ight, bitch, put on the ski mask
Make sure that when we ask
For the dough, they know that we takin' all three bags
Now see that? We got a hero, shoot that nigga
Matter of fact, you hit the back, I'll put two in that nigga
Hard-head motherfuckers always get it
I told him what would happen if he moved
The nigga moved, so I did it (A'ight)
"Did you get it?" I asked my man as he was comin' from the back
Nigga opened his mouth, said nothin' and fell out flat
This cat come out spittin', hittin' my mans, his mans
Couldn't control what was in his hands
I'm hit, damn, I bust back and got the fuck up outta there
Didn't get a dime, but at least I got up outta there

[Chorus]
One more road to cross
One more risk to take
Gotta live my life
Like there's one more move to make
One more road to cross
One more risk to take
Gotta live my life
Like there's one more move to make

[Verse 3]
Ayo, I see it, try to avoid it, but it comes
That's how it's goin' in the slums over crumbs (What)
Somethin' little becomes somethin' major (Uh-huh)
Niggas gettin' blown up like a pager
Ear to ear with the razor (What)
Pour out my soul, took control of hurt
Why must Earl Simmons swim in dirt?
I'm gon' make it work, twenty-eight and tryna get baptized
Priest scared to touch me 'cause he said I gave him bad vibes
Ride when I die, straight down, but I'm plottin'
We all gots to go, but who wants to be forgotten?
I'ma leave a mark and it won't be the mark of the devil
Throw dirt and may your hands burn when you touch the shovel
The level of animosity is stoppin' me from thrivin'
Fuck what them niggas is talkin' about, I'm survivin'
Alive and goin' through it, but I made my bed
So now it's in these flames that I lay my head

[Chorus]
One more road to cross
One more risk to take
Gotta live my life
Like there's one more move to make
One more road to cross
One more risk to take
Gotta live my life
Like there's one more move to make
One more road to cross
One more risk to take
Gotta live my life
Like there's one more move to make
One more road to cross
One more risk to take
Gotta live my life
Like there's one more move to make
Let us pray
Lord Jesus it is you who wakes me up every day
And I am forever grateful for your love, this is why I pray
You let me touch so many people, and it's all for the good
I influenced so many children, I never thought that I would
And I couldn't take credit for the love they get
Because it all comes from you Lord; I'm just the one that's givin' it
And when it seems like the pressure gets to be too much
I take time out and pray, and ask that you be my crutch
Lord I am not perfect by a longshot, I confess to you daily
But I work harder everyday, and I hope that you hear me
In my heart I mean well, but if you'll help me to grow
Then what I have in my heart, will begin to show
And when I get goin', I'm not lookin' back for nothin'
'Cause I will know where I'm headed, and I'm so tired of the sufferin'
I stand before you, a weakened version of your reflection
Beggin' for direction, for my soul needs resurrection
I don't deserve what you've given me, but you never took it from me
Because I am grateful, and I use it, and I do not worship money
If what you want from me is to bring your children to you
My regret is only havin' one life to do it, instead of two
Amen

That's that bullshit
Don't they know that around me
Talkin' about what you got will get you hit (Uh)
I'm not a nice person
I mean, I'd smack the shit out you twice, dog
And that's before I start cursin'
I stay flippin'
One minute, I'm cool, the next minute
I'm up on a nigga, rippin'
That's my style
I'm a cruddy nigga, leave you all bloody, nigga
Service with a smile (Uh-huh)
Suck my dick
And all you niggas that been to jail before

Let's get it on, baby

DMX

[DMX]
Uh-huh (Y'KNOW?)
..
ARF!
Uhh..

[Verse 1]
Take it for what it's worth, my birth was a blessing
Sent to live and die, on earth as a lesson
We each have a star, all we have to do is find it
Once you do, everyone who sees it will be blinded (WHAT?)
They'll tell you that you're bright, and say you have a future
When you turn your back, same cats'll try to shoot ya
Niggas ain't shit, I can live on both sides of the fence
Forget what you do, when you talk, see what you really meant (aight?)
That's what I thought, them niggas was bluffin (uh)
They talk all day but say, nothin (uh)
It gets so dark (what?) the pain's so intense
Since this first rained it's like it's reigned ever since (WHAT?)
Never got paid for a rhyme but I flow (whoo)
Never got a plate on time but I grow (whoo)
Nigga life STAY on the line but I go (UHH)
Went from doin crime to bein kind cause I know
Chorus: DMX (repeat 2X)

I'm gon' live forever, I'm never gon' die
Only thing I fear is that I'm never gon' fly
Carry my weight but I'm never gon' cry
Shit I tell y'all niggas straight cause I'm never gon' lie

[Verse 2]
What is about who I am that makes me unforgettable (HMM)
What it is about what I've done that makes it so incredible (uhh)
"More money, more problems" -- well the fame was worse (uh-huh)
I reached out for love and what came back was thirst (WHAT?)
Blessed with the curse (uh) niggas don't hear me
Niggas don't hear me, Y'ALL NIGGAZ, don't hear me (uh)
What'd I just say? "Niggas don't hear you!" See that?
You gots to FEEL ME to catch what I'm sayin, BELIEVE THAT (UHH!)
But leave that, alone (WHAT?)
We gon' make a nigga wanna be at, your home (WHAT?)
Oh you kinda quiet with the heat at, your dome (UHH!)
If the dog got it he's gonna bring back a bone
Cause we got the chrome (C'MON!)
This is what I live for, or die for
I'm the nigga with the high score, you try for
What you niggas wanna lie for? It changes nothin
I'm the truth for cats, it's some strangers bluffin
Chorus

[Verse 3]
Now if I take what he gave me and I, use it right (uh-huh)
In other words if I listen and, use the light (uh-huh)
Then what I say will remain here, after I'm gone
Still here, on the strength of a song, I live on (HMM)
No second-guessin on what I stood for, I was good for
Stoppin niggas from killin each other in the hood war (UHH)
Comin through showin love, throwin up (UHH)
Them cats not throwin love, you know whassup (WHAT?)
Dark Man baby, that's my name
And I gots to be the realest nigga (UHH) up in this game
Cause ain't no shame, they don't make em like, this no more
Real to the core, big heart but built for war
I stand for what I believe in
Even if what I believe in stops me from breathin
Relatives grievin, but I ain't went nowhere
Listen to the song (C'MON) I'm right there

Chorus

[Intro: Swizz Beatz & Bashir Fadai]
Ruff Ryders
Ride or die
Get at these niggas dog
Yup, yup, yup
I don't really trust humans that much these days
Shit, fact of the matter is, I trust dogs more than I trust humans
Shit, nothin' like that dog love I tell ya
Not just any dog, it's gotta be a pit bull
Yup, that's the only dog for me
You don't wanna get caught in a pit with one of them
They make good companions, but even worse enemies
It's all on how you take it

[Verse]
Nothin' goes down I don't get a small piece of
Get the picture, see the beauty in the beast of
The mad man, Mr. bad man is here
'Cause a nigga like me smells wreck in the air
It just ain't fair, the shit that I be doin' to niggas
And get away with the same shit, ruinin' niggas
Cover all ground and I roll thick like the fog
Only mothafuckin' friend I ever had was a dog
Never ate the hog but glad to say I smoked plenty of 'em
The 5th Precinct to name one of many of 'em
In one verse I beat you worse than your momma
I fuck around and eat you first like Dahmer's
I'ma, play that ass out like a bomber
Killed a nigga once for lookin' like he wanted drama
I'm buggin', the pain it hurts I gotta scream
AHHHHH! Lettin' off a little steam
Society was just too much, couldn't hack it
Six mothafuckin' years in a straight jacket
Yo black it wasn't wise for them to let me out the joint
I never really got better, so I'm not on point
I just might flip, quick, but it's too late to be bitchin'
Got more loose screws than the table in your kitchen
I'm itchin', just hope you ain't around when I scratch
'Cause like I said before, I eats what I catch
Searchin' shit will have a nigga hurt and sick
The dirt you kick will get you in the dirt and quick
Word to Miz, you niggas is kids, don't play
I'm too old for the jokes you'll get smoked, I don't play
I'm won't say what's gon' happen if you force my hand
Someone somewhere will be like, "Lost my man"
Take it to heart, it's about to get dark so run that
All that shit niggas talkin' been there, done that
What black? Think it's an act? Then let me know
But he liked what I'm sayin' so shut the fuck up and let me flow
Yo you think it's a game? Keep playin'
They gon' find your ass somewhere in a creek layin'
It's over you just ain't laid down yet
And in a minute you gon' be that mothafucka that they ain't found yet
Hold off from makin' movies and make moves
Stop talkin' about shit that you can't prove
I'm the mountain you can't move, so why you tryin'
Lookin' at me stupid wonderin' why you dyin'
While you flyin' through the air with a big ass hole in your chest
Wishin' you was holdin' a vest
But it's too late for wishin', so you gettin' this rest
Go to sleep, Papa will take care of the stress
God bless and may He have mercy on your soul
POP-POP, take these two more with you on your stroll, nigga

[Outro: Bashir Fadai & DMX]
Yep, yep, yep
I don't really trust humans that much these days
Shit, the fact of the matter is, I trust dogs more than I trust humans
Shit, nothin' like that dog love, I tell ya
Not just any dog, it's gotta be a pitbull
Yup, that's the only dog for me
You don't wanna get caught in a pit with one of them
They make good companions, but even worse enemies
It's all on how you take it
You know how we do baby
Aight
Grand champ
You know how we do
Scratch all day, match our weight
Fuck nigga
You can't be fuckin' serious
A raccoon ain't nothin' but a big cat

[Verse 1: Styles P]
Holiday Styles
Bitch, I get you shot in the head or shot in the neck
If I ain't gettin proper respect
I don't care if you rap, I still spit in your grill
I don't give a fuck, never have, never will
If it ain't on your hip, then you're lookin to die
I ain't tryin to be the nigga that's gonna look at the sky
Ask God why I'm broke, bitch, I'm cooking the pie
We all gon' die, sooner or later, matter of time
My niggas sell crack, with a package of dimes
Hundred or more, in front of the store, waitin to bubble
Brand new nine, and an eight in a bubble
I put sixteen above ya neck, I love my set
Niggas think they a thug, then thug to death (uh-huh)
Cause the P gonna squeeze 'til no slugs is left (what)
You know I'm good with a hundred of 'dro, gun and an O
You think your shit butter? Hop in front of this toast

[Verse 2: Sheek Louch]
Yo, aiyyo, aiyyo
I say what I want, fuck what y'all think is cool
And I hate cops, cause most y'all was dicks in school
No pussy gettin niggas tryin to cuff the God
Play Sheik out in the yard, but that shit too hard
My dough too long, nowadays, my flow too strong
What y'all make in a year, I kick that for a song
Check my car, I don't care, I don't play fair
Keep some shit in the stash box, then get me the chair
And it don't buck shot and the blast is hard to hear
I'm a true thug nigga, bring it straight to your crew
Why I don't yell when I rap, I'm basically talkin to you
You see the pain in my eye? Nigga, the flame in my eye?
I'm tryin to leave my kids some real fuckin change when I die
From rappin or tellin some cat to reach for the sky
I'm that hunt down nigga, with the four pound nigga
Bounty hunt your whole crew til my bullets go through, WHAT?

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
All I need is a big gun and a Coupe that's crazy quick
A nice house with five rooms, maybe six
A town where money is coming, eighty bricks
Break 'em down to all twenties, is a crazy flip
Bet you never even felt the heat
Til I put the M1 next to your waves and melt the grease
Streets help niggas; niggas don't help the streets
Y'all use beats for help; we help the beats
Who want it with me? Who want it with Sheek? Who want it with P?
If I say so myself, it's a wonderful three
Be in the hood with all your jewels in the glovebox
Same niggas that-a rob you love L.O.X. (uh)
All types of burners, even snub Glocks (uh)
Nice size tecs you could carry in your sweats (uh)
Find your man dead in the trunk of a car (uh)
It's Jada {*mwwaa*} responsible for breakin your heart (uh)
Uh

[Verse 4: Drag-On]
Creep through the streets
For some of y'all rappers, that's mighty hard
Me the Security? Protectin my body? I let my shotty guard
Put chill pills in brains, bullets like Tylenol
Make niggas drowsy from the blood loss, got em noddin off
And take casket naps, fuck that
You shoulda never let this bastard rap
All I know is cold winter, hot slugs through your snorkel
No parents, tale from my horror's no morals
Raised in the wrong era, with no guidance
So you dyin? It's no problem, no lyin
Drag's fire; so ya hamburger beef? I french-fry 'em
Drag done ate your food
Like I know to raise your dukes so guard your chin up
Drag barrels, but shit, I spit-bubble your skin up
Drag scorch niggas for dinner but season 'em well
I don't brag I let the streets tell
Po'-po' now you see he fell

[Verse 5: DMX] {*overlapping last line*}
Uh, uh, now you motherfuckers
Know what my name means when you hear it in the streets (uh)
Y'all bitches fear it cause you weak
You wanna hear it? I make it speak (WHAT?)
You ain't ever bust a gun, but there's a lot of greasy talkin (uh-huh)
What the science behind that son? (I don't know)
A lot of easy walkin
I bust shit down (uh) got down (uh) kick down (uh) shot down (uh)
Ain't tryin to talk about what I got now, but I got now (WHAT?)
I ain't never sold a brick, I done stuck niggas up (c'mon)
And for talkin too much shit? I done fucked niggas up (uh)
It can get "Dark" for real, and I think you already know that (uh-huh)
Well think about it with the brick in your hand before you throw that
Now don't act, cause actin might get you rollin
With what you ain't ready to handle (UHH)
All that's left of your memory, is a candle (WOO!)
It happens quick fast nigga, to bitch ass niggas
Talkin reckless behind your back, them kiss ass niggas (uh)
From the rap shit to the street shit, I keep shit tight
Let them cats spit that weak shit (What!)
I'm DOG FOR LIFE! NIGGA!

[Styles] (Sheek)
They gon' need extra guns and extra blocks
(They wanna Ruff Ryde, Ruff Ryde, Ruff Ryde)
They gon' need extra jails and extra cops
(They wanna Ruff Ryde, Ruff Ryde, Ruff Ryde)
They gon' need extra pits and extra Glocks
(They wanna Ruff Ryde, Ruff Ryde, Ruff Ryde)
They gon' need extra chains and extra watches

[Chorus: DMX]
Niggas won't creep these streets with me
'Cause you know fuckin what these streets'll be
Make you wanna.. then I'm gonna..
'Cause I gotta.. POP POP, POP POP (Nigga!)

I look through the 11th floor window
Take one last puff of the indo
Look through the scope, and let like ten go
Break it down, back in the briefcase
Wipe the sweat off my face so I can leave safe
Outside I breathe safe
Nigga never saw it comin, that's how he got it
Never even thought of runnin, 'cause a nigga plotted
Smart niggas get niggas killed for real
I know, they make a deal? I'm comin with the steel
It's gon' be that cat you don't see that's gon' pop you
Stop you in your motherfuckin tracks nigga and drop you
Get rid of all the clothes (Uh-huh) dump the gun
I hate to be the type of nigga to leave you, slumped and run
But I'm on the job and right now there's more niggas that need to be, left with a head full of lead, restin' easily
And that twenty G's a fee, put to a good use
The only excuse I have for what I do is, love of abuse

[Chorus: DMX]
Niggas won't creep these streets with me
'Cause you know fuckin what these streets'll be
Make you wanna.. then I'm gonna..
'Cause I gotta.. POP POP, POP POP (Nigga!)
Niggas won't creep these streets with me
'Cause you know fuckin what these streets'll be
Make you wanna.. then I'm gonna..
'Cause I gotta.. POP POP, POP POP (Nigga!)

[DMX]
I can catch you in the very building that you live in
Wait until you get right at your door then start spittin
Now they got a ribbon tied to the rail at the top of the steps
I was there, you ain't DIE at the top of the steps
I can do that walk behind you shit and follow you home (Shhh)
Make a noise, you turn around and I put one in your dome (BOOM!)
Last thing you saw was chrome and a, flash of light
I blast him right, nigga, that's yo' ass tonight
I could put a bomb in your car and watch it explode (BOOM!)
Then make em call, tell em all they found was a piece of your clothes and a small piece of your nose and, bone from your arm
Which they really couldn't tell apart, because of the bomb
I could be waitin, camped out in yo' car, in the backseat
With some fuckin chickenwire, soon as you hit the backstreet
I jump up like Jack-in-the-Box, strangle the shit out yo' ass
Clean up the mess and, get away from the cops

[Chorus: DMX]
Niggas won't creep these streets with me
'Cause you know fuckin what these streets'll be
Make you wanna.. then I'm gonna..
'Cause I gotta.. POP POP, POP POP (Nigga!)
Niggas won't creep these streets with me
'Cause you know fuckin what these streets'll be
Make you wanna.. then I'm gonna..
'Cause I gotta.. POP POP, POP POP (Nigga!)

[DMX]
I could be the UPS delivery boy (Uh-huh) or the man
Workin at Toys'R'Us handin yo' kid a brand new toy
I could be the one servin your food wherever you go to eat at
Or that nigga on the corner that you ask, "Yo, where the weed at?"
I could be the one driving the school bus that yo' kids in
Except that, I don't like to involve, women and children
A nigga got feelings, I just put em aside
And when it's time for me to do my job, I just ride
I don't get much sleep (Uh) my soul's tormented
I wish it was a lie but everything I said I meant it
I know I'm doin wrong and everyday I beg the Lord
To forgive me for fuckin with the, double-edged sword
Shit ain't goin too well, BUT THAT'S MY LIFE
I know I'm goin to hell, BUT THAT'S MY LIFE
Sometimes I think what will I do, WITH MY LIFE
Kill nigga kill this IS MY LIFE

[Chorus: DMX]
Niggas won't creep these streets with me
'Cause you know fuckin what these streets'll be
Make you wanna.. then I'm gonna..
'Cause I gotta.. POP POP, POP POP (Nigga!)
Niggas won't creep these streets with me
'Cause you know fuckin what these streets'll be
Make you wanna.. then I'm gonna..
'Cause I gotta.. POP POP, POP POP (Nigga!)
Niggas won't creep these streets with me
'Cause you know fuckin what these streets'll be

[Intro: DMX & Monica]
Grr, yeah
I mean, we all men (We all men)
We know how the shit go
Love one, fuck another
I mean, it is what it is (It is what it is)
I mean, we knew what it was when we became a part of it (Yeah)
Ain't no sense whinin' about it now, you feel me?
It's like

[Verse 1: Monica & DMX]
There's something on your mind (What?)
I can see right through you
I know your girl been treatin' you wrong (Yeah)
But she ain't no good for you
Why do you hold it inside? (Uh)
Boy, you should let me know
I just want to make you right
Wanna be the one you could cry on

[Verse 2: DMX]
Baby, it's like, I love my wife
But we goin' through things and I ain't goin' home tonight
You got time for a nigga, or is he still with you?
Wanna meet at the same spot, or should I come and get you?
Aight, I'll be there in ten, be in the front
I been gettin' what I need so I'ma give you what you want
One-on-one, 'cause you know how to talk to Dog
You walk the Dog and understand New York is hard, baby

[Chorus: DMX & Monica]
So you, you ain't gotta go home tonight
You can stay right here with me
I ain't goin' nowhere
When you wake up, I'm gon' be right there
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
I ain't worried about shit
You're here with me
Look, it's like I love my wife
We goin' through things and I ain't goin' home tonight, aight?

[Verse 3: Monica & DMX]
It's kinda strange, that when you call (Mm)
She's never home, now you're there all alone
And, you deserve so much more baby (What?)
I can treat you better than she can (What?)
Doesn't make sense to keep on loving, and keep on trusting
When, in return all you get is nothing

[Verse 4: DMX]
Damn, you got me fucked up and I'm feelin' it more
Never had a mistress distress before
Oh, come on, ma, like it ain't that deep
Like ain't no love there, like I don't hate that I gotta creep
We go to sleep in each others arms (Yeah)
And I feel like this is where I belong
If lovin' you is right then I ain't wrong
But this is the same ol' song, wife and fam
Gotta be a father and husband, but I'm still yo' man, baby

[Chorus: DMX & Monica]
So you, you ain't gotta go home tonight
You can stay right here with me
I ain't goin' nowhere
When you wake up, I'm gon' be right there
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
I ain't worried about shit
You're here with me
Look, it's like I love my wife
We goin' through things and I ain't goin' home tonight, aight?

[Bridge: Monica & DMX]
The situation's getting critical (Uh-huh)
I watched so many tears fall (Uh-huh)
I know she's not what you want (Uh-huh)
So why you keep on holding on? (Grr)
When I'm right here (What?)
All you need to do is call (What?)
Don't be afraid (Yeah)
'Cause she won't know at all

[Chorus: DMX & Monica]
You ain't gotta go home tonight
You can stay right here with me
I ain't goin' nowhere
When you wake up, I'm gon' be right there
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
I ain't worried about shit
You're here with me
Look, it's like I love my wife
We goin' through things and I ain't goin' home tonight, aight?
You ain't gotta go home tonight
You can stay right here with me
I ain't goin' nowhere
When you wake up, I'm gon' be right there
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
I ain't worried about shit
You're here with me
Look, it's like I love my wife
We goin' through things and I ain't goin' home tonight, aight?

[Intro: DMX]
Uh
This go out to my dog Kato
Rest in peace, baby
Dogs that I call my friends
Praying for all my friends
Things I do for my friends
We miss you, ayo, Kato

[Verse 1: DMX]
Started off two dogs with the same goal (Uh)
Nothing but two dogs walkin' the same road (Uh)
Two different cultures, but had the same heart (Yeah)
Enjoyed seeing the light, but lived in the dark
Fifth album, bumped heads in the parking lot (Aight)
Was a quiet brother, didn't like to bark a lot
Came direct (Uh), when he came, gained respect
So I gave respect (Uh), we shared the same respect
To name regret, in our own circles (What)
Two brothers with good hearts, but if you start
Two brothers that'll hurt you (Yeah)
Know how that dirt do, hittin' four corners
(Arf, arf, arf, arf) Right back upon us
God tried to warn us, but sometimes we don't see
When I first heard I'm like, "This can't be
Y'all niggas is bugging
Got the wrong information or something
Please tell me these niggas is frontin'"
God no

[Chorus]
Dogs that I call my friends
Praying for all my friends
Things I do for my friends
We miss you, ayo, Kato (We miss you, Kato)
Dogs that I call my friends
Praying for all my friends (We miss you, Kato)
Things I do for my friends
We miss you, ayo, Kato (We miss you, Kato)

[Verse 2: DMX]
Ayo, K', let me kick it with you for a minute (Yeah)
There was things left unsaid, dog, we wasn't finished
Never got to say thank you for being a friend
Dogs for life, and you rode to the end
Held dog down, didn't let a day go by
Every time dog came to the Chi (What?)
I was good, trips out to Phoenix with the scrambler squad
Now I come back to Phoenix and like, "Damn, it's hard"
To accept the fact (Uh) that you won't be coming back (Uh)
But I hope you coming back (Uh) 'cause I won't accept the fact
When you came to New York, you had to come to the crib
And vice-versa (Yeah), that's just how we did
Remote control cars (What), we would race all day
It was adventure, we would chase our day (Yeah)
So I'm not gonna say goodbye my nigga (Uh-uh)
Instead I would rather (Rather)
Focus on the time we spent together, that's what matters

[Chorus]
Dogs that I call my friends
Praying for all my friends
Things I do for my friends
We miss you, ayo, Kato (We miss you, Kato)
Dogs that I call my friends
Praying for all my friends (We miss you, Kato)
Things I do for my friends
We miss you, ayo, Kato (We miss you, Kato)

[Verse 3: DMX]
I need you to save me a spot, next to you and the Lord (Aight)
I don't know when I'm coming, but keep checking the door (Aight)
But while I'm here, knock on wood
I'll make sure your kids remember who their father was and Val is good (Aight)
Understood how real niggas move
We don't talk, but you gon' always have family in New York, believe that (Yeah)
From where you at you can see that
We dogs for life and to death and I mean that (Vato)

[Chorus]
Dogs that I call my friends
Praying for all my friends
Things I do for my friends
We miss you, ayo, Kato (We miss you, Kato)
Dogs that I call my friends
Praying for all my friends (We miss you, Kato)
Things I do for my friends
We miss you, ayo, Kato (We miss you, Kato)

[Outro: DMX, Magic & Val, Val]
Yo, "Where the Hood At" is banging right now, man
That was your favorite joint, ya know what I mean?
We miss you, Kato
It's going just like we thought it would, baby
We miss you, Kato (Yeah)
We miss you, Kato
I'll always love you, K'
This is dedicated to, this is dedicated to
The streets, this is dedicated to

[Hook]
And the dog is out, arf arf arf arf
And the dog is out, arf arf arf arf
And the dog is out, arf arf arf arf
It's just D
And the dog is out

[Verse 1: DMX]
Started gettin a little too big for the cage that I been trapped in
Cats new it was a problem, went from robbin to rappin
Guns got the clappin, another trip to the morgue
We all know why it's happenin, another bit by the dog
When there's nothin left to eat, I ate away at my soul
Felt destructive cause I don't give a fuck if I go
I know y'all been told I don't give a fuck about livin
Killin other dogs got you cats chasin Pigeons
Got me itchin to bring back the beast from within
What I catch I'mma eat, in the streets I'mma win
I've been top dog and I'mma stay top dog
So what the fuck you got to say dog?
You cats play games that dog ain't with
Suck my dick, behind my back dog ain't shit
Well this is it, from now on if you ain't out the camp
We out to vamp, put 'em up against the champ
You bitch

[Hook x2]
And the dog is out, arf arf arf arf
And the dog is out, arf arf arf arf
And the dog is out, arf arf arf arf
It's just D
And the dog is out, c'mon c'mon

[Verse 2: DMX]
I don't think you cats see too clearly
If it ain't that you must be deaf, cause y'all niggas don't hear me
But I know I got you scared to death
How many other niggas you know when you see 'em make you hold your breath?
All a nigga did was take a pause
Did a couple of movies and you thought this whole rap shit was yours?
Stop being greedy, when was the last time you gave to the needy
Believe me, I run through niggas like hallways with the cops behind
Give it to a nigga all day cause I pops the nine
Man listen, if you don't wanna see your man missin, man listen
I get dough like a nigga in a up north flick
And still roll like a nigga on some up north shit
The way dog flip out, cats'll never understand
Niggas be like "X I thought I was your man!"
Not!

[Hook]
This is dedicated to, this is dedicated to
The streets, this is dedicated to

[Verse 3: DMX]
My dogs is dogs that love to brawl
Bring as many as you got cause we gon fuck 'em all
Dicksucked in the hall
The same shorty thats puttin any work on her knees
I'm duckin her call
A dog is a dog is a dog for life, dog been a dog, dog in your wife
I got kids this age
But let 'em keep talkin slick and I'm gon put somethin hot up in his ribcage

[Hook]

When the dog is out, bitch ass niggas get bit or fucked
One or the two, and I'm not Ja Rule
Feel me? Aight

[Hook]
Fuck all ya'll niggas (ay fuck you 2)
Ay yo fuck y'all niggas (man fuck you too)

[Verse 1]
It's big dog baby gettin down like what
See I'm a thorough bread, I don't fuck wit muts
Bloodline is where the pups at
They off the Grand Champ, yea what black
Don't nothin move less, dog say so
Cats clueless about the way it go
Off the chain I got at least 3 kills
Even though my last album only did 3 mil
I still give em chill cuz they feel dog
I can't help what it is, shit is real dog
You must have thought that it was a joke or somethin'
Now you done fucked around
And got your man choked for frontin'
Now hold up playa cuz I don't play those games
And don't ask me shit cuz I don't say no names
See what I know I'm taking to the fuckin' grave
So keep knockin cuz you ain't gettin a fuckin' thing

[Hook x4]

[Verse 2]
Ay yo
"Who We Be" was off the last joint
But now it's who we see and we forget the last joint
Cats ain't never walked like X
Even before Kool G Rap talked like sex
I've been around since at least 83
So ain't no sense in you motherfuckers hatin' me
Cuz I'm gon be here when you cats is gone
And other cats is on, another batch is born
Don't give a fuck about none of y'all
Fuck each and every one of y'all
Cuz I done done it all, been where ya at
Been where ya goin', then brought it back
I tried to tell ya about it but you wouldn't listen
Now I'm gonna take you to the hood cuz the hood will listen
I wish you woulda listened cuz then you woulda known
That it's only right to give a dog a bone
Bitch

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Aw Man
There are some things I can't stand
When a nigga holla wanna shake my left hand
When a nigga follow cuz he actin like my man
Nigga might as well swallow cuz he actin like a fan
And I got balls like you do
Man I got Paul to pull through you
Stan don't they know how we do
Ear to the streets with our hearts to the people
Gots to give a little to get somethin back
And what you usually give see you ain't nothin black
But when you don't give then it won't last
His shit will disappear like wit a nigga that smoked fast
You'll get broke fast, that's the Lord's will
Hold up I think somebody's a the door, Shhh chill
You sit right there, I'm gonna answer that
Cuz when I finish poppin ain't nobody answerin back

[Hook x4]

[Outro]
Fuck it

You thinkin' life, I'm thinkin more like, "What's up tonight?"
Come on, ma, you know I got a wife
And even though that pussy tight, I'm not gon' jeopardize my life (Aight?)
So what is it you want from a nigga? (What?)

Nothin' more, nothin' less
But you at my door willing to confess that it's the best you ever tested (Aight)
Better than all the rest, I'm like, "Aight, girlfriend, hold up

Knock on the door, no show, I'm 'sleep, tryin' to creep
With your best friend, put it in, dig deep (Ayy, X, let me talk to 'em for a minute, aight)

[Bridge: SisQó & DMX]
Oh, I know, I know it's so hard to be (What these bitches want from a nigga?)

[Chorus: DMX & SisQó]
What these bitches want from a nigga?

[Intro: Swizz Beatz & DMX]
Let's get it on
We don't give a what-what
We don't give a what-what (Shit)

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz & DMX]
Get it on the floor, get it-get it on the floor (What?)
Get it on the floor, get it-get it on the floor (What?)
You don't wanna party, then your ass gotta go (What?)
You don't wanna party, then your ass gotta go
Now you can ride to this motherfucker, bounce to this motherfucker
Freak to this motherfucker (Let's get it on)
Get it on the floor (What?), get it-get it on the floor (What?)
Get it on the floor (What?), get it-get it on the floor (Woo)

[Verse 1: DMX]
Once again it's the darker nigga
Here to spark a nigga, pick apart a nigga
But the dog is bigger, under stress
So unless you wanna get blessed to the chest
With slugs from the Smith & Wess', rest
Or the pump'll put a hurt on a nigga
Dump six motherfuckin' feet of dirt on a nigga
My hands stay dirty 'cause I play dirty, the mob way
You don't know, fuck it, find out the hard way
A nigga's job is never done, I handle my business how it come
And there's never been a one on one
There hasn't been a problem, I dissolve 'em like salt
Lock it up like a vault whenever wreck is caught
And it's my fault, keep niggas on point duckin' down
Niggas like you need to get bust, you fuckin' clown
I extort to support my peeps
And hold down the fort, never get caught, 'cause I creeps, nigga

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz & DMX]
Get it on the floor, get it-get it on the floor (What?)
Get it on the floor, get it-get it on the floor (What?)
You don't wanna party, then your ass gotta go (What?)
You don't wanna party, then your ass gotta go
Now you can ride to this motherfucker, bounce to this motherfucker
Freak to this motherfucker (Let's get it on)
Get it on the floor (What?), get it-get it on the floor (What?)
Get it on the floor (What?), get it-get it on the floor (Woo)

[Verse 2: DMX]
I'm at the crossroads, look, but I'm not really sure which way to go
Should I play the low for what I did the other day?
They on their way, the flow got me strikin' this random
I can't stand 'em, fake-ass niggas wantin' to be the Phantom
Lookin' over my shoulder, 'cause it's colder than it was
Extort shorty, because I'm a little older than cuz
And the buzz from the saw, with the chain to your brain
Will turn that big nigga to a fuckin' stain
The pain from the dirt makes the hurt go away for a minute
But I'm gon' die by it 'cause I'm like knee-deep in it
And you motherfuckers wonder why I start shit
'Cause when you look in my face, you see that hard shit
'Cause I done been to Hell and back I ain't with sellin' crack
I'd rather rob a nigga, leave him with a shell up in his back
On the real just to show proof, hit the GWB
And blow the whole roof off the toll booth, bitch-ass nigga

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz & DMX]
Get it on the floor, get it-get it on the floor (What?)
Get it on the floor, get it-get it on the floor (What?)
You don't wanna party, then your ass gotta go (What?)
You don't wanna party, then your ass gotta go
Now you can ride to this motherfucker, bounce to this motherfucker
Freak to this motherfucker (Let's get it on)
Get it on the floor (What?), get it-get it on the floor (What?)
Get it on the floor (What?), get it-get it on the floor (Woo)

[Verse 3: DMX]
When I crawl, leave a nigga sprawled out after I smoke 'em
I'll slit his throat, dick in the mud and let his blood choke 'em
Up north niggas get the pick stuck up in 'em
And in the streets bitches get the dick stuck up in 'em
My M.O. is manslaughter, kid
'Cause on the reals I done wet up more motherfuckers than water did
Slid, 'cause I got to slide when the dirt is done
A homicide but they want me on the Murder 1
But as long as I got my gun, I'm aight
Stay outta sight while it's light and then come out at night
To make moves again, stomp and bruise again
I know I'm goin' to Hell 'cause I choose to sin
All my motherfuckin' life I've been the Devil's advocate
Now niggas never even knew the Devil had a kid
But he does, and when you hear the buzz of the chainsaw
You'll know why I'll split your motherfuckin' brains for

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz & DMX]
Get it on the floor, get it-get it on the floor (What?)
Get it on the floor, get it-get it on the floor (What?)
You don't wanna party, then your ass gotta go (What?)
You don't wanna party, then your ass gotta go
Now you can ride to this motherfucker, bounce to this motherfucker
Freak to this motherfucker (Let's get it on)
Get it on the floor (What?), get it-get it on the floor (What?)
Get it on the floor (What?), get it-get it on the floor (Woo)

[Outro: Swizz Beatz]
Don't start nothin', it won't be nothin'
Don't start nothin', it won't be nothin'
You wanna start somethin', it's gon' be somethin'
You wanna start somethin', it's gon' be somethin'
Don't start nothin', it won't be nothin'
Don't start nothin', it won't be nothin'
You wanna start somethin', it's gon' be somethin'
You wanna start somethin', it's gon' be somethin'
Let us pray
Father thank you for makin' me righteous and accepted through the blood of Jesus
Because of that I am blessed and highly favored by you
I am the object of your affection, your favors surround me as a shield
And the first thing that people come in contact with is my favor-shield
Thank you that I have favor with you and man today
All day long, people go out of their way to bless and to help me
I have favor with everyone that I deal with today
Doors that were once closed are now open for me
I receive preferential treatment and I have special priveledges
I am God's favorite child
No good thing will he withhold from me
Because of God's favor my enemies cannot triumph over me
I have supernatural increase in promotions
I declare restoration of everything that the devil has stolen from me
I have honor in the midst of my adversaries, and an increase of assets
Especially in real estate and an expansion of territory
Because I am highly favored by God I experience great victories
Supernatural turnarounds and miraculous breakthroughs; in the midst of great impossibilities
I receive recognition, prominence and honor
Petitions are granted to me even by ungodly authorities
Policies, rules, regulations and laws are changed and reversed on my behalf
I win battles that I don't even have to fight because God fights them for me
This is the day, the set time, the designated moment for me to experience the free favors of God
That profusely and lavishly abound on my behalf
In Jesus' mighty name we have prayed
Amen, and Amen

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Over and over I done told ya, boy
I'm a G-Unit motherfucking soldier, boy
And when you gon' get it in your brain?
The gate's wide open and the dogs off the chain

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I be that youngin with that gun that’s tellin' ya stop frontin'
I be that yougin on the run after I pop somethin'
In the Bible I read death is of the tongue
And if you talk about death enough death is gon' come
Jay taught me how to flow, they shot him in the head
Randy ass was there, now he runnin' scared
Some say I'm gangsta, some say I'm crazy
If you ask me I'll say I'm what the hood made me
Now I can stunt 'til my ass dead broke like JD
Or put a hundred grand on every nigga head that play me
See I'm cool with them Haitian mob niggas
They say ''Sak pase Nap boule'' and rob niggas
The media be tryin' to make a nigga look bad, what's with that?
See my flick next to Preme, Papi and Cat
And Montana, I kill 'em with the grammar
I enhanced in the slammer after bangin them hammers
X, what up? (Aight)

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You don't live that, you shouldn't say that
Cause what come out your mouth'll get you shot down
Throwin' your money around and we don't play that
Getting in our line'll get you shot down
We know where you hang, we know where you stay at
That bullshit you on'll get you shot down
Here's a few cliques that you shouldn't play with
G-Unit, Ruff Ryders'll get you shot down

[Verse 2: DMX]
Fuck y'all niggas talkin' 'bout, think you playin' with?
Double R, G-Unit, the same old shit
Put the faggots in the ring, watch 'em all quit
All y'all niggas is pussy, suck my dick
Ain't nothin' but a handful of man still standin'
I remember 50 in a cypher when Onyx was "Slammin"
Now we meet again, it's all good, my nigga
Back to the street again, it's all hood, my nigga
Knock on wood, my nigga, we both walk the dog
We ain't get to where we at by luck, shit was hard
But once we got through the trials it's all smiles
'Til a big type nigga all of a sudden get wild
Now why you gotsta go and take me back to where I came from?
I'mma make you remember where you know my name from
45th Street, and blaow-blaow Ave
I done ran through your crew and only let off half, nigga

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You don't live that, you shouldn't say that
Cause what come out your mouth'll get you shot down
Throwin' your money around and we don't play that
Getting in our line'll get you shot down
We know where you hang, we know where you stay at
That bullshit you on'll get you shot down
Here's a few cliques that you shouldn't play with
G-Unit, Ruff Ryders'll get you shot down

[Verse 3: Styles P]
If your head ain't off of your shoulders
You ain't get shot, you got nipped nigga (just nipped)
Cause if my chrome hit a piece of your bone
It's gon' do more than chip, nigga (a lot more than that)
Yeah, what the fuck is the problem?
The Porsche is red, the buckets is army
30 shot handguns, the gutter is starvin
Niggas like me might rush your apartment
Bloodstains'll fuck up your carpet, brain on the window
I smell murder every time that the wind blow
Tie him to the chair and then knock out his chinbone
I don’t want the throne or the crown, I ain’t sell enough
You can have the jail or the ground, you ain't in hell enough
I'm the one that flood the gutters
Better tap your man and let him know P'll love to cut his
And niggas is gettin shot down, two guns up
Double R, S.P., holdin' D Block down

[Hook: 50 Cent]
You don't live that, you shouldn't say that
Cause what come out your mouth'll get you shot down
Throwin' your money around and we don't play that
Getting in our line'll get you shot down
We know where you hang, we know where you stay at
That bullshit you on'll get you shot down
Here's a few cliques that you shouldn't play with
G-Unit, Ruff Ryders'll get you shot down

[Intro]
I smell pussy! (4x)

[Verse 1: DMX]
I'mma take it back to the shit talkin' slick talkin'
Slap a nigga and call him my bitch and keep walkin'
HALF Y'ALL niggas is pussy
The other half of y'all niggas is fake thugs so please don't push me
If we was in jail you'll be in the bullpen under mad pressure
Leave you up on the stretcher nigga I'm gon test you try your hand
When they carry you out I'mma tie your man
But these cats ain't built like your killed like
Blood gets spilled like poke a nigga tonight
Bang bang HA! It hurts
The fuck you screemin' on me for I'm puttin' in work
We leave more bodies then the bloods and crips
This is how it's goin' down nigga thuggin' a bitch
Fuck a nigga wit we on the same bullshit y'all niggas on lets get it on

[2X]
You know how we roll nigga bring the noise

No matter how many cats he brought wit'um I'mma split'um
Hair raised on my back get low and hit'um
Stoped him dead in his tracks
Knowning damn well he don't mean what he said in his raps
Dogs don't know nothin' but bust that nigga
Dogs don't nothin' but fuck that nigga
Dogs don't know nothin' but suck my dick
When it comes to what happened dogs don't know shit
Did two years in one night
I popped two peers in one fight
Two ears in one light, aiight, aiight
That's what it is follow
Too many dick riding niggas wanna swallow
Follow my mans and them
And get popped with yo mans and them is what Im handin' them
It's hot things, drop things, stop things, drop things
Cook a nigga like hot wings

[Hook] 

[1X]

[Verse 3: DMX]
Been around the block did my dirt
Earl thorough as in thorough, put in work till it hurt

Yes that means all y'all niggas
Most y'all cats don't know what ruthless means
Will you be able to survive the truth I've seen
Cats would'nt be alive if you was on my team
But the truth is the ride is rough ya mean
Got me like GOD what the fuck
Dog gon bang somebodys getting' stuck
Back up the truck jump right the fuck out on niggas

Point blank range so the slug go through
Then I'mma hit yo crib and pop yo family too NIGGA!!

[Hook]

[Intro 1:DMX]
Uhh (huh) yeah, it is what it is
Yah'mean? We untouchable baby

[Chorus:Syleena Johnson]
I keep my song in my soul
Blessed my heart and made it go
Tops of our heads to tips of our toes
We're untouchable
Everyday the sun'll shine
Took this dream and made it mine
I'm gettin' down one thing that I know (WHAT!)
We're untouchable

[Verse 1:DMX]
We built this Double R thing from the ground up
Another principle of when it's beef, niggas round up
Gettin' down like what nigga, YO!
That's all it takes and it's like, HERE WE GO!
Thorough type niggas that control the streets
Rollin' deep, holdin' heat, don't even think about sleep
When we creep, niggas goin' down for the count
It ain't sweet, fuck around and knock money out
C'mon fella, you don't want the dog with the camp
Not Old Yeller, a pit bull and dog is the champ
You know better, think about crossin' the line
Hit your sweater, with about ten from the .9
Double R and we get down for life!
Let a nigga KNOW we can go down tonight
From the tops of our heads, the tips of our toes
WHAAAAT! We untouchable, AIGHT?
Yea, WHAT!

[Chorus:Syleena Johnson]
I keep my song in my soul
Blessed my heart and made it go
Tops of our heads to tips of our toes
We're untouchable
Everyday the sun'll shine
Took this dream and made it mine
I'm gettin' down one thing that I know (WHAT!)
We're untouchable

[Intro 2:The Cross]
Yeah, yeah, YEAH! Be strong

[Verse 2:The Cross]
I represent the have and the have-nots
All the niggas with the weed spots
And all my niggas on them cell blocks
We gon' R-U-double-F R-Y-D-E
You can't fuck with my army
My niggas is untouchable, eatin' niggas like Lunchable
.45 be crushin' you when the bullets be touchin' you
Paul bearers'll carry you
To the cemetery where your momma gon' bury you
Black suit be fittin' you nigga, I got hood degrees
Plus I'm street like powder, milk, and government cheese
If you a runnin' man nigga, then I'ma shoot up your knees
Then it's me against the world, man against machine
S.D.T.S. - stick to my routine
My knuckle game impeccable, crack game incredible
Lawyers for my niggas who be sittin' in the Federal
Nigga, I'm untouchable

[Chorus:Syleena Johnson]
I keep my song in my soul
Blessed my heart and made it go
Tops of our heads to tips of our toes
We're untouchable
Everyday the sun'll shine
Took this dream and made it mine
I'm gettin' down one thing that I know (WHAT!)
We're untouchable

[Intro 3:Infa-Red]
Lyrically I'm, untouchable..
Infa-Red nigga, let's go..

[Verse 3:Infa-Red]
All I can know is 365 days of pain
My name, how to sell cocaine
And I was taught to buy guns so big when I go to the roof
I can aim and shoot down a plane
Infa-Red's my name but fuck all that
Fall back and witness how the streets made me the grimiest nigga alive
I sell you a fake pie, shoot out your fake eye
Give niggas a break, nah; I gotta chase mine
Don't wear your watch around me nigga I take time
Like niggas that them blue tried to like
I turn men to mice, canary yellow my ice
And Ruff Ryde on anybody, to be precise
But I handle my business like I'm supposed to
When you go in the precinct, that's the only time you see my poster
But I could post up and get rid of my pieces
Out in Cali sellin' rocks the size of Domino pizzas
I'm untouchable, nigga

[Chorus:Syleena Johnson]
I keep my song in my soul
Blessed my heart and made it go
Tops of our heads to tips of our toes
We're untouchable
Everyday the sun'll shine
Took this dream and made it mine
I'm gettin' down one thing that I know (WHAT!)
We're untouchable

[Intro 4: Sheek]
Double R.. whoo! All day..
Yo, aiyyo X let me get 'em daddy - yo, yo, yo

[Verse 4:Sheek]
U-N-T-O-U-C-H, A-B-L-E-S
Sheek the new Elliott Ness (no doubt)
Nigga, Bloodline, D-Block; two of the best
Hang the Double R chain from the side of the car
Drive by and put your brains on the side of the bar
Sheek heavy in the hood (uh-huh)
And I don't mean cause I gained weight in the hood (nah)
My aim is good, aiyyo X what they want it to be here?
Our hammer's cocked, outside of the house on the lawn chair
Yeah nigga what? The new rap LeBron's here
Get 'em dog, we the new America's nightmare
And we don't say much, we just get it on
That's why we don't get touched, y'all like a dutch
Hands all on you, I'm tryna warn you
To stay in your place, so you don't get laced
And them pretty ass shades, can stay on your face

[Chorus:Syleena Johnson]
I keep my song in my soul
Blessed my heart and made it go
Tops of our heads to tips of our toes
We're untouchable
Everyday the sun'll shine
Took this dream and made it mine
I'm gettin' down one thing that I know (WHAT!)
We're untouchable

[Verse 5:Drag-On]
Uhh, uhh, uhh, c'mon!
You motherfuckers got me back on my grizzly, I'm back on the grind
I'm back to the streets, catch a beef, come back with the nine
I'll murder ya man, come back with his shines
I tote two guns, I don't care if you box, I don't care if you blind
I spit in your eye like niggas is eatin, I'm splittin' the pies
Frank Nitty your rap, how gritty am I? The city is mine
Yeah, you get in my way I pity your moms
Yeah, my block is real, my niggas is armed
My borough is thorough, we bang with each other
I'm switchin' my diamonds and changin' the color
With change of weather, canary in the sun, uhh
I bury ya nigga then bury the gun, X whattup?
Me and you is untouchable (uh-huh)
We both had bricks they couldn't sniff cause the coke was uncrushable
Guns is fingerprint-proof, we "Ryde or Die"
You drivin' by, we clap at your ride, good-bye

[Chorus:Syleena Johnson]
I keep my song in my soul
Blessed my heart and made it go
Tops of our heads to tips of our toes
We're untouchable
Everyday the sun'll shine
Took this dream and made it mine
I'm gettin' down one thing that I know (WHAT!)
We're untouchable

Cause I've seen the hearses now
But if this was Gilligan's Island, Thurston Howell, wow
Look at his kicks, they worth a thou'
Isn't it sad, do what I say or wish that you had
Your Mrs get grabbed, stabbed up, you piss in a bag

Empty a clip of hollow tips into yo' daughter's face

Collect my dough, make the fuckin hit and I'm gone

Fuckin coward, I wonder how it - feels

Believe whoever I hit up, will never get up
Tell me, how it's goin down nigga

Since the first day in it, I made a promise to myself
I was gonna make it happen, that's the way I felt
You know Philly never scared, play the cards we dealt
Doin it my way, you bitches strugglin for help
I hear your rumors and your so-called beefs
But it's a different story any time we meet in the streets
I'm fully in it bitch, your shit is juvenile to me
We can squash it, go 'head let you warm up the crowd for me
I hate to even be like this, y'all bring it out
To tell the truth it excites me, I scream it out
Sick wid'dit, ain't a bitch that can get wid'dit
Admit it, I'm that bitch you can't live wid'dit
And I'mma keep it comin long as I'm here
Pitbull, back at'cha neck, I'm hearin them cheer
E-V-E is what they need in they life, I'm bout mine
Now I'm done wit'chu, fuck out my face, wastin my time

But y'all still missin the point like a free throw shot
Get it? This ain't some'n you learn, this is some'n you earn
Turn it up and give me some'n to burn
That boy 'Kiss is a hell of a man
Treat your life like a cell phone, so try to get a helluva plan
Cause most dudes left the hood broke
A couple knew what they was doin, so they came back like good coke
Down South they'll tell you 'Kiss is good folk (that's right)
Up North I hit my niggas off with good smoke
Out West they ridin with me, now I'm back hard
I'm just worried bout the rats that's in my back yard
Hated by many, confronted by none
I trust two guys, one's God, and one is my gun
Jada is the nice guy, 'Kiss is the monster
D-Block and Double R is my sponsor

Five time motherfuckin champ!

Motherfucker!

A nigga done had this rap shit
I'm out..

[Intro: DMX]
Got me on the run
Uh, uh

[Verse: DMX]
"Boom, boom, boom, open the door, ATF!"
Too late to send my girl downstairs to say, "He left"
Hit the basement, go through the replacement door
Come up in my neighbor's yard, with a taste for war
You know I laced the four with the hollows
Crack the safe, grab the bottles
What you want me to do? Beep Carlos!
Two houses over by the tall black fence
I keep the hooptie parked for situations like this
There go Grease, yo, get in, you drive
What the fuck you doing, nigga? Tryna stay alive
Cops on every corner, I lean back and try to cruise by
Who the fuck coulda snitched? Must have been a new guy
Damn, they back on our ass
Put your foot back on the gas, step on it fast
Trying to pull up on the side, but I'm packing to blast
Trying to take them niggas heads off, fuck cracking the glass
Hey, look out, damn, came so close
You almost hit that bitch! (Like you said nigga, almost)
Shit, the cops hit her and I know they ain't gon' leave her
Go up here, make this left, pull it over, take a breather
Drop it on the floor!
Boom! Got it through the door
Pedal to the floor, leave officers flyin'
Death is in the air and I don't know if it's mine
But I know if it's time, it'll be what it is
And all I can think of is, "What about my kids?"
Shit, they on the corner, hit the sidewalk, quick!
One, two, three, four, five more clips
Hit the fire hydrant, get low for the shootout
Run through the fire, pull a joint from my boot out
Caught me in the shoulder, the neck, the ear
I'm going out fast, and the last thing I hear is
"Boom, boom, boom, open the door, ATF!"

There would be never be a time that I have to fight the devil and I cannot win
In the name of Jesus
I lose all strong holds that the devil had over my life
In the name of Jesus
When I save a thousand two or save ten
So I thank the lord for my wife
In the name of Jesus
I want to thank you what you showed me what you told me
In the name of Jesus
I want to thank you for your love and watchin over me
In the name of Jesus
I don't have to, go through what I went through anymore
In the name of Jesus

In the name of Jesus
You gave me the book, so now I just look when I need the word
In the name of Jesus
You took, a crook, gave him a new look now he speaks the word
In the name of Jesus
It don't matter what we did tell it to the lord and he forgives
Whatever it was right or wrong
I'm a catch up with the herd then I'm comin home
In the name of Jesus
I ran away for far too long starve too long
In the name of Jesus
Where people perish for lack of knowledge
They all too strong let's get it on
In the name of Jesus
I realize I'm a sinner
I repent my sins and right this moment am a beginner
Baby in the spirit, let me go
In the name of Jesus please let me go!!!! (Come on!)

[Hook: Patti LaBelle]
I know it cannot happen without you, you you, without you, oh, oh oh oh

[Bridge: DMX] + (Patti LaBelle)
I gotta say what's on my mind (Say what's on your mind)
You saved my life a thousand times (Saved a thousand times)
Gave me a dream that came to be
Opened my eyes so I could see

[DMX & Patti LaBelle]
I had my ups and had my downs
Until you turned my life around
And I want the whole world to see
They don't know what you mean to me

[Verse 3: DMX]
In the name of Jesus
All praises due to the shepherd watchin the flock of sheep
In the name of Jesus
Ain't even about where I'm steppin
You watch in the dark when I'm sleep

It's such a long, long train ride
It's such a long lonely ride back home

[Verse]
Now I know only I can stop the rain
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Now I know only I can stop the rain
It's not that we gotta do what we do
It's what we know
So to me it ain't nothin' but bein' true, but
Now I know only I can stop the rain
It doesn't have to be the way it is, you say it is
Just because for the past 20 years every day it is (What?)
Now I know only I can stop the rain
I wanna be able to walk out my front door
Without worryin' about comin' to conflict with the law, 'cause
Now I know only I can stop the rain
If I follow Him, they'll follow me
And I'll speak life into the words that you can see, 'cause
Now I know (C'mon) only I can stop the rain
We get away with it everyday shit
But everyday shit catches up with you and when it does you can't say shit
Now I know only I can stop the rain
If I don't, you will, what I won't, you still
What makes us feel like we gots to kill, when
Now I know only I can stop the rain
How many more lives must we lose
How many more times must we choose to trust these fools
Now I know only I can stop the rain
If it ain't broke, don't fix it, I gave it to you straight
Don't mix it, twist it (What) up for some slick shit
Now I know only I can stop the rain
I don't have to talk to it anymore
I don't have to walk to it anymore, I'm out the door (What)
Now I know only I can stop the rain
I wanna find peace with the Lord
I don't wanna find a beast with the sword, I can't afford to
Now I know only I can stop the rain
When everyday of my life
Is just a constant fight between wrong and right
Now I know only I can stop the rain
I thank you, Lord for my life
I thank you, Lord for keeping it loose when things got tight
Now I know only I can stop the rain
Only I can stop the rain
Only I can stop the pain
Now I know only I can stop the rain
Only I can stop the rain, stop the rain
Only I can stop the rain
Only I can stop the rain because the rain calls on me
Now I know only I can stop the rain
Only I can stop the rain
I'm out
Gotta have that...

Thick like blood, where's my dogs
Uh, there's my dogs

[Verse 1]
Now who I am is who I'll be until I die
Either accept it or don't fuck with it
But if we gon' be dogs then you stuck with it!
Let me go my way but walk with me
See what I see, watch me then, talk with me
Share my pain, make it a little easier to deal with it
Cause despite all the fame YOU I'm a keep it real with it (true)!
Rob and steal wit' - dog nigga what
Ride till we die, on till it's up
Love is love and I enjoy the love
But when it's conflict then it destroys the love
You can't toy with love, niggas take to the heart
You ain't gon' find too many niggas willing to, bark in the dark
(come on!) Keep your head from the start, don't fuck it up now
Later on they be hit like, fuck it how??

Give me unconditional love, and I give it right back

[Hook]

Ride till we die, on till it's up
Thick like blood, where's my dogs
Uh, there's my dogs

[Verse 2]
Most niggas make movies, but niggas like us make it happen'
The shit we used to do never thought we would make it rappin
But now we here, at the same place at the same time
And got jokes cause now niggas get it, with the same rhyme
Yeah niggas is living comfortable, cause life is all good
But one thing we must remember, is that life is all hood
And the casket's all wood and we all take there one day,(shit)
Shit today is Sunday we both can be there on Monday
Life is funny like that, (WHAT), bugged the fuck out
Sometimes I take it to the church, Sometimes I thug the fuck out
Niggas get drugged the fuck out they boots, violatin' families rules
Motherfucker stay in your shoes!
Now see what you need to do, is chill shorty
'body please come and get him before I, kill shorty
I will do for my niggas as they would do for me
Bust a faggot like you for free, wanna see
COME ON!

[Hook]
I will rob and steal witcha, dog nigga what
Ride till we die, on till it's up

Uh, there's my dogs

[Verse 3]
I'm always surrounded by dogs, for the love
Only niggas I fuck wit is thugs nigga what
Blood in Blood out vatos locos homes, theres no chocos homes
When we smoke them chromes, and how we broke them bones
While the last niggas is ass niggas
The skimask niggas to trash niggas they ass niggas pussy
And half you cats can't even flow
And when I hear y'all niggas around my head, well you know
But that's a whole 'nother issuse, right now we own this
We keep spittin' like this, how the FUCK we gon' miss?
Cause the camp is strong, and the stamp is strong
Double R (love, love, love, love!)
Motherfucker, keep the caskets flowing

[Intro: DMX]
Sometimes
Sometimes you just know
You just know, that's all

[Chorus: Nardo]
I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Hold on
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life
Hold on, hold on

[Verse 1: DMX]
The best of y'all niggas remind me of myself when I was younger
When it was hunger that stopped a nigga from goin' under
And you wonder why I pat you on your head and smile
Look in your eyes and thank the Lord for my child
Meanwhile, there's somethin' I gotta show you, and I hope you can take it
Gotta leave you in the desert, and I hope that you make it
Gotta put you on yo' ass to see what it does to you
When you stand up, you'll see that I'm just showin' love to you
Other niggas'll put a slug through you, over your ends
Cats I fuck with are real, but hey, those are your friends
It's just what you got comin', sometimes you don't know
What you askin' for, yet you ask for more
Shut the casket door, this one here good as done
You thought you was a killer, you swore you'd never run
Nigga died with his gun still up in the holster
It is comin' in the air? Yeah, it's gettin' closer

[Chorus: Nardo]
I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Hold on
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life
Hold on, hold on

[Verse 2: DMX]
I see life through many shades of grays and blacks
I could take that and hit 'em with the blazin' tracks
When I make that you fake cats have violent dreams
It takes another dog to be able to hear my silent screams
The Devil got a hold on me, and he won't let go
I can feel the Lord pullin', but he movin' dead slow
Let 'em know that amidst all this confusion
Some of us may do the winnin', but we all do the losin'
It's just who does the choosin', is you goin' up or down?
What have you been provin'? Just that you a fuckin' clown
Been seen the bullshit but never spoke on it
'Cause I know that deep down you really don't want it
I was traded the chance of bein' a child with a father
For a talent and bein' able to survive when it's harder
My balance on the high beams of life, keep my dreams in strife
That's why I hit these motherfuckin' streets at night, come on

[Chorus: Nardo]
I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Hold on
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life
Hold on, hold on

[Verse 3: DMX]
There's a lot of shit that I let slide 'cause it's outta my hands
Lot of niggas I let ride, but it's not in my plans
That a lot of my mans is not seein' through the fog
Families by the truckloads, fleein' to the morgue
Full moon, (Ah-ooh), the howlin'
(Grr), the growlin', (Shh), the prowlin'
Don't know love, can't show love
That means you gonna need mo' love than an old thug
But hold up, roll up, talkin' out the side of your mouth
Is what's gonna let niggas know why you died in your house
While they lied to your spouse, told her it was suicide
But you and I both know the truth'll never die
Listen, nigga, if you scared, get a dog, but be prepared for the morgue
'Cause you dead up in the fog and that's your head by the log
I can smell it in the air, I can tell when it's there
This is hell and we're both here, can you feel it? Tell me yeah

[Chorus: Nardo]
I can feel it coming in the air tonight
Hold on
I've been waiting for this moment for all my life
Hold on, hold on

[Intro]
Mmm
Man
Uh
Shit stay happening
You know? (Uh)
It's crazy, dog
It's off the hook
But you know
Real niggas get by
Know we eat regardless
'Cause I'm heartless

[Verse 1]
Who is this I see coming through? It's like 3 on the A.M
I'ma rob this nigga, and when I'm done, I'ma slay him
For being stupid, like coming through after 1 or 2
And having a gun that he couldn't get to, yeah, that one'll do
Foolish niggas learn the hard way, and I teach 'em
Be in the wrong place at the wrong time, and I'll beat you
Like Jigga said, niggas test you when your gun goes warm
So I keep 'em scattering like roaches when the light comes on
From night 'til dawn, right from wrong holds no weight
.357 slugs with a snub-nosed trey-eight
Settin' all them issues straight (Why?)
Squashing all beefs
To the point where the police was blocking off streets
They got me trapped off in the building, but you know how that go (Uh-huh)
I stay fucking with a hood rat, so I run up in a rat hole
Go through the hallway, see police, we're face to face
And being I'm telling you this story, means I caught another case

[Interlude]
Yeah
It's either you or me
And more than likely, it's gonna be you, than me, aight?
Feel me, yo

[Verse 2]
Day two of the saga, this fucking drama continues
I'm waking up like every two hours, looking out my windows
Plus, I keep the four-four pointed at the door, just in case
And when they bust in, I'll bust them and I'm gunning for the face
"What a waste of potential", is what my teachers used to tell me
"You can always get a job", and deep shit they tried to sell me
Got me nowhere but broke and fucked up in the game
But now I got a name (Uh-huh), and niggas know my name (Okay)
Knock at the door, "Police! We're looking for a man"
"Who killed a couple of cops last night and the reward is ten grand"
I played like a bitch, "It's just me here, and I'm not dressed"
"And that guy sounds kind of dangerous, I hope you make an arrest"
That was a close one, now I know I gotta get out of the city 'cause I'm hotter than lava
I'll holler tomorrow
Hit my dog on the horn, he like, "Fuck, you done did?"
"They done ran up in my crib, nigga, patting down my kid!"

[Interlude]
(*Dial tone*)
Uh

[Verse 3]
Put the harness on the dog, load up the weapons
Murder's on my mind (Uh), no half stepping
Motherfuckers want war, you can get it, 'cause I'm tired of running
Remember me as the nigga that died gunning
Kamikaze mission, C-4 strapped to the chest
Run up in that joint, raw dog, fuck the vest
They can keep theirs, because it won't be the slugs that'll kill 'em
It'll be the roar of the C-4 as I'm bringing down the building
'Cause when I go, I'm taking a bunch of them motherfuckers with me (Uh-huh)
I ain't sitting around waiting for them faggot niggas to come and get me
I'll bring it to 'em, service with a smile, what, nigga?
Didn't know a dog with rabies was in the cut, nigga?
And now that you're finally finding out what this shit means
I'm at the precinct, on 116th
Run up in there, open up my jacket, "You motherfuckers looking for me?"
"Well, here I am, now you coming with me"

[Outro]
Man
This shit is crazy, baby
Can you dig it?
Can you dig it?

Sometimes niggas is worse than the bitches
So I'm a holla at you, but first with the stitches
Cats don't know who you fucking with
'til you fucking with X and you stuck in shit

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big Stan]
Yo Grease I need this beat, no disrespect

Look around and I see the rap game is a mess
So many chromes, now they getting me vexed
Upset and insane in how the game gonna change shit
Sounding the same, and it's a ma fucking shame
While lames think they flow so sick, getting excited
Yeah they got a sick flow, its called the "Young Hov Virus"
BUT, let me fall back into character
B got so hot, never been an amateur
Ask the locals, Boy its Lo-Co
Never Stop my flow, wanna go pro, you know
Check the history, started with the R's
Now I'm running with the line, four time, no mystery
Dog, tryna position me to get in the door
But since the door don't open wide enough, we rippin it off

[Hook]

[Verse 3: DMX]
Dog, gonna be Dog, that's how I get down
Step up, nigga, sit down, put your shit down (AIGHT!!!)

(DOG, It ain't worth it)
TAHHHH, yeah you right, soon as your man make it dead at night
I'll be there, aight?? (then what??)
Everything stops, money turns on the light, and Pa Pop Pop Pop!!!

[Big Stan]

Blow the pound up, niggas wanna what with us
Bloodline and the dog I trust, so for the dog I bust

And trust me, I'm gonna do my motherfuck'n thang

[Hook]

Yeah! Come on man, ya niggas don't know what the fuck this shit is!

Gutter {*repeat 4X*}

[Intro: DMX & Sheek Louch]
Yeah, I'm right here, dog
Where my dogs at?
We right here, dog
Where my dogs at?
I'm right here, dog

[Verse 1: DMX]
What must I go through to show you shit is real?
And I ain't really never gave a fuck how niggas feel
Rob and I steal, not 'cause I want to, 'cause I have to
And don't make me show you what the MAC do
If you don't know by now, then you slippin'
I'm on some bullshit that's got me jackin', niggas flippin'
Let my man and them stay pretty, but I'ma stay shitty
Cruddy, it's all for the money, is you with me?
Get the bitches and I'll commit the crime
When it's on, we transform like Optimus Prime
I'll form the head, roll out, let's make it happen
If we ain't gonna get it with them, we'll take your cap
Bustin' off, dustin' off the softest niggas
Money with the biggest mouth, yo, let's off this nigga
Up north, this nigga never made a sound
Breathe too fuckin' hard and you're gettin' bust down

[Chorus: Sheek Louch & DMX]
Yo, yo, y'all niggas wanna be killers? (Get at me, dog)
Y'all niggas wanna feel us? (Get at me, dog)
Y'all niggas want the real (Get at me, dog)
What, yeah (What the deal?)
Y'all niggas wanna be killers? (Get at me, dog)
Y'all niggas wanna feel us? (Get at me, dog)
Y'all niggas want the real (Get at me, dog)
What, yeah (What the deal?)

[Verse 2: DMX]
Nowadays, it ain't lookin' too good for certain niggas
I'm hurtin' niggas (What you doin'?)
Robbin' niggas, jerkin' niggas, stickin' niggas
'Cause they deserve it; when money got murdered
They know he died slow 'cause they heard it
The nigga ain't blew up the spot a while
And the motherfucker ain't got shot in a while (You know)
It just takes a light up to fuck the night up (Yeah)
Blow everything in sight up (Boom)
Fuck around and I'll have your ass right up (haha)
He makes up some shit, he wasn't able to stand
I got shit that'll disable a man with the wave of a hand
The days are longer and it seems like I'm facin' time
I've got a lot of dreams, but I'm not really chasin' mine
I soak it all up like a sittin' fly 'cause nowadays, gettin' by
Is nothin' more than an occasional meal and gettin' high
I live to die, that's where I'm headed
Let your man hold somethin', now it's all about you can get it

[Chorus: Sheek Louch & DMX]
Y'all niggas wanna be killers? (Get at me, dog)
Y'all niggas wanna feel us? (Get at me, dog)
Y'all niggas want the real (Get at me, dog)
What, yeah, yeah, come on (What the deal?)

[Verse 3: DMX]
One in the back left your faggot ass face down
Lucky that you breathin', but you dead from the waist-down
The fuck is on your mind? Talkin' that shit that you be talkin'
And I bet you wish you never got hit 'cause you'd be walkin'
But shit happens and fuck it, you done did your dirt
Niggas is wonderin' how the fuck you hid your skirt
Right under their eyes like a surprise to the guys
That one of their mans was a bitch in disguise
I'm fuckin' with cats that order more hits and slaughter more kids
Let me holla at you, youngin', Baltimore shit (Oh)
Nah'mean? I'm just robbin' to eat
And there's at least a thousand of us like me mobbin' the street
When we starvin', we eat whatever's there
Come on, you know the code in the street; whatever's fair
Blood stains and chalk, means your man couldn't walk
After the talk about him not bein' on 11-33 to New York
Transformin'-ass niggas'll get it quick
And yo, for real, that nigga K can suck my dick
And it's gon' take all these niggas in the rap game to barely move me
'Cause when I blow shit up, I have niggas fallin' like white bitches in a scary movie
Ah! You know I don't know how to act
Get too close to niggas, it's like, "Protected by Viper, stand back"
What's this? I thought you niggas was killers, demented
The fuck you want me to do with this coward?
Finish him, it's ended

[Outro]
Yo, you holdin'? (No doubt, man)
I'm holdin', you holdin'
Yo, let's ride, nigga, yo
Come on, yo, we goin' to the mess hall with this shit
Fuck that, hold up, hold up, hold up, man, I gotta
Yo, man, shut the fuck up man, you ain't sayin' shit, bitch
You ain't hold—, you holdin'? (I got the aux, son)
Yo, 'cause I'm seein' this cat
I'm seein' this cat up in here, man (Yo)
The nigga, the nigga, the nigga just came in
Talkin' all this hardcore shit what he was doin' at the other jail
You know what I'm sayin'? (Fuck all that, man)
Yo, check it, I don't give a fuck (I ain't with all that problems, man)
Yo, listen, man, 'cause you, you just be talkin' shit, man
Hold up, ayo, why, why you always wanna suspect everybody, man?
You suspect, man, you supect, yo, just chill (You know what I mean?)
Yo, y'all niggas ridin'? (Aw man)
Yo, we gon' take this nigga on a ride (Yeah, straight up)
Straight, rough ride
Yo, let's go, let's get the fuck up out of here
Yo, man, shut the fuck up, dog
Yo, come on, yo
Yo, what's up, nigga? (What up)
What you mean "what's up, nigga," you don't know me
Yo, hold up

[Skit: Faith Evans & Guy]
(*Dial tone*)
I don't believe it
(*Dial tone*)
Hello?
Whose dick you sucking?
Don't call me with that bullshit, alright?
You lying, you lying to me, B

Suck my fucking dick, you bitch-ass nigga, I don't—
No, you explain it to me, bitch, you know what I'm talking about
I don't know nobody up here, y'all don't fuck with nobody up here, and I ain't been fucking with nobody here, I don't know nobody in fucking Yonkers
Lying-ass bitch, you ain't shit
Do I got to holler his name too?

Bitch, you fuckin' him

[Chorus: DMX, Lovey & Schamika]

[Verse 1: DMX]
I'm politicin' with this chicken, wonderin' if I'ma creep her
Little hoodrat bitch from 25th named Tenika
Comin' through, like I do, you know, gettin' my bark on
Knew she was a thug, 'cause, when I met her, she had a scarf on
54-11, size 7 in girls
Baby face, would look like she was eleven with curls
Girlfriend (What?)
Remember me from way back?
I'm the same cat with the wave cap
That motherfucker that TNT used to blaze at (Woo)
Still here, so it's all good
Oh, you know my niggas Rich and them doin' they thing on 35th? Damn, it's a small hood
And it's all wood, so let me get that number, I get up (Aight)
Hit you on the jack later on, see what's up
Talkin' to shorty make me wanna do somethin' nice (What?)
Lookin' at that ass make me wanna do somethin' tonight (Uh)
And I know right when I see right, shorty lookin' like she tight
And she bite, better give a nigga the green light, we might

[Verse 2: DMX]
I'm gettin' at shorty like, "What you need? What you want?" (Huh?)
Want for nothin', 'cause I got you, but you front (True)
I see you with your baby father, but it don't matter
Since you gave me the pussy, that ass is gettin' fatter (Woah)
Let that nigga play daddy, make moves with me
I've done kept it more than real, boo, can't lose with me (True)
Heard he smacked you 'cause you said my name while y'all was sexin' (Woah)
Ran up on this cat he thought was me and started flexin' (Uh)
You know I ain't even with that, so he gon' have to get that just on GP
Try to creep me (What?), leave that nigga sleepy
On the strength of you, well, that's your kid's daddy
I ain't gon' send him on his way, put him up in that big Caddy
But let him know, never mind, yo, I need you to go
Take this snow up to 1-5-0, see Joe
Get that, come back with that, and we can split that, sit back
Fuck, puff a L, forget that, you with that?

[Verse 3: DMX]
Ayy, yo, this chicken got me diggin' her moves 'cause she's smooth
Win or lose, whoever she choose, gets the dues (Aight)
Respect is not expected, but it's given 'cause it's real (Uh)
Being neglected's the norm, expected, the deal (True)
Lie, cheat, and steal for me
Puttin' somethin' in a nigga's wig if he squeal for me
Kill for me, you're still with me?
'Cause we get down, like, "What?"
Told you's from the door, it ain't all about a nut
I'm gon' be fair, tryin' to be there, we gon' see then
Hit me with the question, boo, that answer gon' be "Yeah"
See there, somethin' can go wrong, it does
Loved it, let it go, and it came back, that's how strong it was
But she belonged to cuz, couldn't belong to me (Uh-uh)
She had two kids by this nigga, it was wrong for me (Uh-uh)
But we gon' always be best of friends (Ha-ha)
Mad love, boo, 'til the end (Ha-ha)

[Outro: DMX]
Uh

[Verse 1]
What's on y'all niggas minds? (What?) Fuckin' wit' me
Y'all know somebody has told you about fuckin' wit' D
Stuck in a tree is what you will be like a cat
And I'm a dog at the bottom looking up, now what's that? (Uh)
Your worst nightmare 'cause I take it right there (Uh-huh)
You got niggas coming? Where they at? Right where? (Yeah)
I make 'em like air, floatin' away
Wouldn't tell what he was thinking so I opened a way (Come on)
Left him broken away, you know he hurt before he died
Makes you wonder (Uh) if he lost his shirt before he died
Only two knew the answer and one of us is dead (Uh-huh)
So anyone who seeks the truth can get it straight to head (Uh)
Then you and him can discuss what I did (Uh)
Yeah, it was wrong, dog, but I slid (Woah)
I'll repent one day, just not right now
You hear my shit all on the street, I'm kinda hot right now (Come on)

[Chorus]
I don't give a fuck about y'all niggas 'cause y'all ain't killing nothing
I don't give a fuck about y'all niggas 'cause y'all ain't killing nothing

[Verse 2]
I wanna break bread wit' the cats that I starve with
Wanna hit the malls with the same dogs I rob with (Yes)
Wanna be able to laugh with the niggas that I cried with (Yes)
When it's over be like these is the niggas that I died with (Yes)
What do you do when you find out, in the hall, there's a rat?
What do you do when you find out that your dog is a cat?
Shit, all niggas pack, can't hold but two
So while you getting more gats I'm putting holes in you
A snubnose will do, break 'em off real proper
Nina keep spittin' and I ain't gonna stop her
Cock her, unlock her, let her go
Give it to his man (What?) just to let him know (What?)
All things considered, it was real for a minute (Come on)
Got what was yours and tried to steal something with it
Now feel something hit it, your chest that is
The best that is, is possibly the best that slid
Don't stress that, kid

[Chorus]
I don't give a fuck about y'all niggas 'cause y'all ain't killing nothing
I don't give a fuck about y'all niggas 'cause y'all ain't killing nothing

[Verse 3]
When niggas hear that dog bark, they better run
When police hear that dog bark, they better come
They expect to save their lives, but they lives will be lost (Yes)
There is a price to pay, how many lives will it cost? (Come on)
Since I run with the devil, I am one with the devil (Uh-huh)
And I stay doing dirt, so I'ma come with the shovel (Uh-huh)
Is you on a level of a madman whose mind's twisted?
Mad niggas dreams caught the last train, mine's missed it (Woo)
Listed as a manic-depressive with extreme paranoia
Hey dog, I got something for ya
Hear my name, feel my pain
Niggas wanna steal my fame, but first, feel my reign (Come on)
Know what it's like to suffer (Uh), never have enough of (What?)
Shit starting off hard then only getting rougher (What?)
Tougher, but then came the grease
So if you wanna save the peace, tame the beast

[Intro]
If you love somethin', let it go
If it comes back to you it's yours
If it doesn't, it never was
Hold me down, baby

[Chorus]
Either let me fly or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway
I'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day
Either let me fly or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway
I'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day

[Verse 1]
Hold me down, niggas wanna know me now
Didn't want to play with me when to show me how
No meow, 'cause it's all about the bark
Let the dog loose, baby, it's about to spark
Light up the night like the 4th of July
Niggas know, when I let go, niggas die
With this Y and you don't know, you slow
Like Baltimore, if you ain't tryin' to go you blow
I soak up all the pain and accept it in silence
When I let go it's violence, 'cause the wildest
Is the dog barkin' up the tree for the cat
In the fog, what y'all niggas see is the bat
Flappin' away, but I'm blind like Stevie
Niggas don't hear me, still tryin' to see me
Stop bein' greedy, you heard what I said
Let me go, let me flow, or I'm dead

[Chorus]
Either let me fly or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway
I'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day
Either let me fly or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway
I'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day

[Verse 2]
I sold my soul to the Devil, and the price was cheap
And yo, it's cold on his level, 'cause it's twice as deep
But you don't hear me, ignorance is bliss and so on
Sometimes it's better to be thought dumb – shall I go on?
Yo, on the real, what the deal? It's a mystery
How is it I can live and make history?
If you don't see it, then it wasn't meant for you to see
If you wasn't born with it, it wasn't meant for you to be
But you can't blame me for not wantin' to be held
Locked down in a cell where the soul can't dwell
This is hell, come meet the Devil and give me the key
But it can't be worse than the curse that was given to me
It's what I live for, you take away that and I'm gone
There's a difference between doin' wrong and bein' wrong
And that ain't right, just keep it fair, baby
Put me in the air and I'll take it there, baby, yes!

[Chorus]
Either let me fly or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway
I'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day
Either let me fly or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway
I'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day

[Verse 3]
I'ma flow regardless because I'm an artist until I'm trapped
I'ma continue to hit the hardest whether I scrap or rap
Give me dap, but you ain't my friend
I see it in your eyes, you contemplate my end
You waitin' for that bend in the road where you were told
That you would go when you were old and if you died young, it was cold
Sold, not for nearly what it was worth
Think back 26 years, be like, "What if his birth
Was a miscarriage and I never existed?"
Have I given somethin' that if taken away you'd have missed it?
Didn't know, yet I persisted, it was the call of the wild
I merely say what's in my heart and you call it a style
Don't put it in a cage, don't mistreat it
You say you hunger for knowledge? Here it is, eat it
Another song completed is another thought captured
Let me do my thing, I got it locked with this rap shit

[Chorus]
Either let me fly or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway
I'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day
Either let me fly or give me death
Let my soul rest, take my breath
If I don't fly I'ma die anyway
I'ma live on, but I'll be gone any day

[Outro]
Or give me death
Or take my breath
I'ma die anyway
But I'll be gone any day
Or give me death
Or take my breath
I'ma die anyway
But I'll be gone any day
Where my niggas?
Uh, ah, for my niggas
Uh, ah, for my niggas
Uh, ah, for my niggas

[Intro: DMX]
Uh, uh
My niggas

[Chorus: Big Stan]
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog
My niggas (My niggas)

[Verse 1: Kasino]
My dogs, the beginning of this bloodline of mine
That spark that's in a nigga's heart and 'cause him to shine
Before all the rhyme, lessons that I keep in my mind, I owe you
And I give my right hand to show you
Whether it's fist or guns, whatever it go to
It's me they go through, if ever they want you
I'd line the flame, dead game and trying to scratch
K-A-S, I know where my dogs is at

[Verse 2: Big Stan]
And I'm gonna be the one behind just to keep you on your toes
I be your extra eyes and hold you down around your foes
I be your extra gun, if you need me let me know
For my dogs, I be the first to cock it back and let it go
They do it for the dough, me, I do it for the love
You my nigga to the death so I treat you like my blood
If push comes to shove and they try to send you back to the streets
I give my last to put you back on your feet, feel me

[Chorus: Big Stan]
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog
My niggas (My niggas)
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog
My niggas (My niggas)

[Verse 3: Drag-On]
You're my dog, nigga, I die for (Shit)
Bust a five for, see the judge and lie for (Uh)
You the type of nigga, I throw weight up on the block for
Just go ahead and lock jaws, and your half? I got yours
Send in the dog, I smell it all night
I told niggas to shut up and write
X barks with a hell of a bite
For the love, they always will be 'til they kill me
I put my thugs on it, and slugs with my blood on it

[Verse 4: Loose Cannon]
And to my motherfuckin' dog, big ups to your first share
Niggas know the deal, just wait for them plaques to get shipped
Do your thing, nigga, you know we got your back
'Cause real dogs always return with food for the pack (Uh)
Why these wack niggas swinging? When they all gon' miss?
Take it from me, he was nice before all this
Yo, X, rain on 'em, 'cause after that comes the blood
Ruff Ryders, feed all they dogs wit' raw blood

[Chorus: Big Stan]
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog
My niggas (My niggas)
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog
My niggas (My niggas)

[Verse 5: DMX]
My people show love (What?), and haven't left me stranded yet
Though I have a death wish, it ain't been granted yet
So until then, I'm gonna be that nigga all up in your chest (Come on)
Until the Lord decides to lay my ass down to rest
Bless the body at the funeral and hope I don't burn
Was a hard-headed nigga and nope I don't learn
Saw the truth but chose to ignore it, wasn't going for it
'Til a nigga had to give it to me (Ahh), then I saw it
This is clear as day, I know here's the day
I'ma be on my way, nothing more to say (Yes)
But take me Lord, make me Lord, what you will
Really wanted to chill but learned how to kill
It's been downhill from then on, 'cause I been on
Some shit, and on, every move to get ten on
The next sack, but you know that's how the X act (Come on)
That's why these street niggas is waiting for the next track

[Chorus: Big Stan]
This is for my dog, this is for my dog

This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog, this is for my dog
This is for my dog

[Verse 1: DMX & DMX as God]
You tell me that there's love here, but to me it's blatant
That with all the blood here, I'm dealin' with Satan
Plus with all the hatin', it's hard to keep peace (Uh huh)
Thou shall not steal, but I will to eat
I tried doin' good, but good's not too good for me
Misunderstood, why you chose the hood for me?
Me? I'm aight; I just had to work hard at it
Went to grandma for the answer and she told me that God had it
So now here I am, confused and full of questions
Am I born to lose or is this just a lesson?
And who is gon' choose when it gets turned around?
And will it be laying in my own blood and on the ground?
My child, I've watched you grow up and I've been there
Even at those times you least suspected it, I was there
And look at what I've given you, a talent to rhyme
I may not come when you call, but I'm always on time

[Chorus]
Somebody's knockin'
Should I let 'em in?
Lord, we're just startin'
But where will it end?
Somebody's knockin'
Should I let 'em in
Lord, we're just startin'
But where will it end?

[Verse 2: DMX & DMX as God]
But when the funds are low, the guns'll blow
Lookin' for that one that owe, make 'em run that dough
No! Put down the guns and write a new rhyme
You'll get it all in due time
You'll do fine, just have faith 'cause you mine
And when you shine, it's gon' be a sight to behold
So don't fight to be old or lose sight when it's cold
See that light down the road? It's gon' to guide you there
Two sets of footprints, I was right beside you there
But what about them times I only saw one?
Those were the times when I was under the gun
It was then I carried you my son
Led you to safety, it just wasn't your time to face me (uh huh)
Ayo, a few of them times I thought you would erase me
When all you did was embrace me, prepared me for the worst
Offered me eternal life and scared me with the hearse
And the curse turned to grace when the hurt turned to faith
No more runnin' or slidin' in the dirt, 'cause I'm safe

[Chorus]
Somebody's knockin'
Should I let 'em in?
Lord we're just startin'
But where will it end?
Somebody's knockin'
Should I let 'em in?

[Verse 3]
So if I'm your man, I'm in your hands, what's your plan?
Never had a friend 'cause you couldn't trust your man
Learned to stand before I crawled, things were twisted
And if you showed me anything at all, then I missed it
Looked the wrong way, I've done some wrong things
Kept a bad attitude, but that's what wrong brings
And now you mean to tell me that after all this time
It was you that kept the dog from goin' out of his mind?
It was you that breathed life into my lungs when I was born?
And it was you that let me know what was right from what was wrong?
And it was you that let me do, what I knew what could be done?
And it was you that gave me a good wife and a beautiful son?
And it's been you speakin' to me inside my mind?
And it's been you who has forgiven time after time?
It was you who opened my eyes so I could see?
It was you that shined your light on me

[Spoken Word: DMX]
I come to you hungry and tired, you give me food and let me sleep
I come to you weak, you give me strength, and that's deep
You call me a sheep and lead me to green pastures
Only askin' that I keep the focus in between the chapters
You give me the word and only ask that I interpret
And give me the eyes that I may recognize the serpent
You know I ain't perfect, but you'd like me to try
Unlike the Devil, who just wants me to lie 'til I die
Lord, why is it that I go through so much pain?
All I saw was black, all I felt was rain
I come to you because it's you who knows
You showed me that everything was black because my eyes were closed
You gave me the light and let me bask in your glory
So it was only right that, when you asked for this story
I put it together, to do our dogs some good
Our dogs being brothers and sisters in the hood
Plenty of times you sent help my way, but I hid
And I remember once, you held me close, but I slid
There was somethin' that I just had to see
That you wanted me to see so I could be what you wanted me to be
And I think I've seen it, 'cause I don't feel the same
Matter of fact, I know I've seen it, I can feel the change
And it's strange, almost got me beatin' down your door
But I've never known love like this before
It's a wonderful feelin' to get away from the pain
And up under the ceilin', I get away from the rain
And the strain that I feel when I'm here is gone
I know real, so I wipe away the tear, it's on
And I almost lost faith when you took my man
Monty, Paso, and Jay's brother Dan
And I fear that what I'm sayin' won't be heard until I'm gone
But it's all good, 'cause I really didn't expect to live long
So, if it takes for me to suffer for my brother to see the light
Give me pain till I die, but, please, Lord, treat him right

[Intro]
Love my niggas, but where's my bitches?
I love my niggas, but where's my bitches?
Love my niggas, but where's my bitches?
I love my niggas, but where's my bitches?

[Chorus]
It's all good, it's alright
Fuck all day, fuck all night
Call my bitches, 'cause wherever I go, y'all my bitches
East to the West coast, all my bitches

[Verse 1]
Yo, chickens is good for pluckin', so I'm stickin' bitches, fuckin'
Got 'em trickin' while they suckin', give em dick and they be buggin'
I've done it all, from mackin' two hoes on a three-way
Dominican hoes on B-way, country hoes in V-A
And they all say the same about my game, it's tight
That's why every night a different group of bitches start a fight
Over some dick that they don't even own
All I'm givin' them is the bone
Blowin' up a nigga phone, but ain't nobody home (Damn)
I'm in the zone, tryna do things
Let's turn this into a crew thing, "Wassup girlfriend, you game?"
They'll wonder "Why?", when I leave at night
It's because I thieve at night
I'm leavin' bitches not breathin' right
I fuck they head up with some slick shit
Hit 'em off with some long dick shit
Make it some quick shit, but rip shit (Woah)
Then I'm out, just like the trash on a Thursday
Knowin' she'd be givin' up the ass on the first date

[Chorus]
It's all good, it's alright
Fuck all day, fuck all night
Call my bitches, 'cause wherever I go, y'all my bitches
East to the West coast, all my bitches

Fuck all day, fuck all night
Call my bitches, 'cause wherever I go, y'all my bitches
East to the West coast, all my bitches

[Verse 2]
Flocks of bitches by the dozens, from sisters to cousins
Got 'em doin' shit they said they wasn't ever gonna do
Like knowin' I'd fuck the bitch that she was close to (Uh-huh)
Still gave up the ass and dough, she was supposed to (What?)
Pictures of bitches and flicks of chicks
Videos with the baddest hoes, suckin' dick
It's the dog in me, that makes me do wrong
And honeys can't help but get strung (Why?)
'Cause the game is too strong (Okay)
I like 'em greedy, black like Edi
Eyes beady, willin' to give to the needy
I done ran through 'em all, from around the way bitches (Uh-huh)
To them outta state hoes, and even hittin' gay bitches (Uh)
All I tell 'em is, "Let me get that," then it's on
Knock her motherfuckin' boots, and then I'm gone
I got the white bitches sayin', "It's a black thing"
'Cause I leave that ho with no dough and plenty of back pain

[Chorus]
It's all good, it's alright
Fuck all day, fuck all night
Call my bitches, 'cause wherever I go, y'all my bitches
East to the West coast, all my bitches
It's all good, it's alright
Fuck all day, fuck all night
Call my bitches, 'cause wherever I go, y'all my bitches
East to the West coast, all my bitches

[Verse 3]
Bitches who get props, 'cause they know who can get got
And they can get shot, by the way a niggas lip drop
Walk up in the spot, knowin' what she want strictly
When hon' wants the dickly, hon' comes and gets me
Hits me, pays me, doesn't get crazy
Knows to be Swayze, 'cause that's daddy's baby
I keep them hoes in check, like the government
Hittin' 'em off with nothin' but the dick, and they lovin' it
Huggin' it, like it's they best friend, 'cause it is
Word to Miz, fuckin' with tricks is just biz'
I deal with strictly dimes
Got 'em committin' they first crimes
Now she suckin' dick, for the first time
And ain't no secret, 'bout how I freak it, when they sleeped it
Never know how I peeped it, then creeped it
That's how I know this must be that shit
I tell them bitches, "I'll be back," and they believe that shit

[Chorus]
It's all good, it's alright
Fuck all day, fuck all night
Call my bitches, 'cause wherever I go, y'all my bitches
East to the West coast, all my bitches
It's all good, it's alright
Fuck all day, fuck all night
Call my bitches, 'cause wherever I go, y'all my bitches
East to the West coast, all my bitches
It's all good, it's alright

Nigga

[Intro: Kid]
One, two, X is coming for you
Three, four, you better lock your door
Five, six, get your crucifix
Seven, eight, don't stay up late

[Chorus]
One, two, X is coming for you
Three, four, better lock your door
Five, six, get your crucifix
Seven, eight, don't stay up late

[Verse 1]
Who's afraid of the dark?
Responsible for the murders in the park
When I bark, they hear the boom, but you see the spark
And I see the part of your head which used to be your face
Be replaced by nothin' for bluffin', what a waste
Niggas wanna see me taste my own medicine, picture that
Get on some old second grade shit, I'ma get you back
Retaliate, if it hates for you to think I took a loss
When all I did was shook it off, yeah, you heard me, shook it off
Man, if we was up north, niggas would've been fucked you
But then we in the streets, niggas should've been stucked you
Plucked you like a chicken wit' your head cut off
They'll find you wit' your back open and your legs cut off
And as for your man, don't you ever in your mothafuckin' life
Know when I gotta gun come at me wit' a knife, aight?
And forgettin' you ever saw me is the best thing to do
Don't give a fuck about your family, they'll be resting with you

[Chorus]
One, two, X is coming for you
Three, four, better lock your door
Five, six, get your crucifix
Seven, eight, don't stay up late (Yes!)
One, two, X is coming for you
Three, four, better lock your door
Five, six, get your crucifix
Seven, eight, don't stay up late

[Verse 2]
You got yourself in a predicament, that you can't get out of
You already in some shit, but it's about to get hotter
Fuckin' with a nigga like you runnin' your mouth
Will, have that same nigga like you, gun in your mouth
But won't be like the last time when you run in the house
'Cause I ain't knockin' on the door, I'm comin' in the house
And I'm gunnin' for your spouse, tryin' to send the bitch back to her maker
And if you got a daughter older than 15, I'ma rape her
Take her on the livin' room floor, right there in front of you
Then ask you seriously, whatchu wanna do?
Frustratin', isn't it? Wanna kill me, but I'ma kill you
Now watch me fuck just a little while longer, please, will you?
This is revenge, know that before you die
And despite how much I hate to see a grown man cry
I'ma make you suffer, see your ass in Hell, motherfucker
Click, boom-boom, see your ass in hell

[Chorus]
One, two, X is coming for you
Three, four, better lock your door
Five, six, get your crucifix
Seven, eight, don't stay up late
One, two, X is coming for you
Three, four, better lock your door
Five, six, get your crucifix
Seven, eight, don't stay up late

[Verse 3]
When I speak you better listen, the harder it gets, the more follows
And I'm hittin' 'em with shit that they can't all swallow
I keep my slugs hollow, keep families with sorrow
Keep motherfuckers like you, not seein' tomorrow
I will borrow a gun, then run 'til I catch you
Let you slip up, just once, then I'ma wet you
Stretch you out like a limousine
'Cause where I catch you is where I catch you, that's what killin' means
Fuck whoever's standin' there when you get what you got comin'
'Cause once I hit you in your head, the witnesses start runnin'
Niggas started somethin', but they chose not to finish it
So I'ma wrap it up, for real, dog, 'cause I'ma win this shit
Fuck it yo, let's end this shit, I don't need the plaques
And I ain't a DJ, nigga, so I don't need the wax
Gimme slugs for my gats, gimme hoods for my rats
Gimme wood for my bats, then they meet where the fuck I'm at, for real

[Chorus]
One, two, X is coming for you
Three, four, better lock your door
Five, six, get your crucifix
Seven, eight, don't stay up late
One, two, X is coming for you
Three, four, better lock your door
Five, six, get your crucifix
Seven, eight, don't stay up late
One, two, X is coming for you
Three, four, better lock your door
Five, six, get your crucifix
Seven, eight, don't stay up late
One, two, X is coming for you
Three, four, better lock your door
Five, six, get your crucifix
Seven, eight, don't stay up late

Ain't no way you're gonna stop my flow
Ain't no way ya niggas just don't know
Where niggas is about to go, oh-no, oh-no

Ain't no way ya niggas wanna stop mine
Ya niggas must be out yo' mind

[Verse 1]
Now, what the fuck is you niggas pressin' me for? (Uh)

If I was testin' your jaw, maybe then you would respect me
But you can't respect me 'cause you don't even know me nigga, check me (Come on)
I'm that motherfucker that'll put you to sleep, while you sleepin'
Red dot from a hundred feet, you just knew you was creepin' (Uh-uh)
But bad decisions lead to last decisions (What?)
Fast collision, now yo' ass is missin' (What?)
Take it over there, now you bring it back to the streets (Uh-huh)
Have you forgotten what it means when a dog shows his teeth?
Let me break it down for you, he's about to attack you
Still standin' here, faggot? You must want me to smack you
You ain't been there or done that, (What?)
Fuck is y'all niggas tellin' me?
The only nigga, walkin' the streets with four felonies (Come on)
But peep this, I see shit is hard, niggas is strugglin' (Uh-huh)
So leave rap alone for a little while, go back to hustlin' (Woo)

[Chorus]
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my flow
Ain't no way ya niggas just don't know
Where niggas is about to go, oh-no, oh-no
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my shine
Ain't no way ya niggas wanna stop mine
Ya niggas must be out yo' mind
I don't know why

[Verse 2]
Give it to niggas just how they give it to, me (Uh)
Hit 'em in a rhyme because I'm an MC (Uh)
Been a lot of places, most niggas won't, see (Uh)
That's why I'm at a level that y'all niggas won't, be (Uh)
Let your man hold somethin' now he want, more (Uh)
You ain't no fuckin killer, what was the front, for?
It was a time when the world was at your front, door (Uh)
Now they change places (Why?), niggas want, raw
Niggas laughed at me and was mad at me (Uh-huh)
'Cause the way life was goin', had to be a, tragedy (Come on)
After me, it's over, I'ma take the whole verse
I try'd to keep it real, that's why I let y'all niggas go first (True, true)
But you looked a gift horse right in the mouth (Uh-huh)
Didn't appreciate what you got, when you got it (Come on)
So if I see it, I'ma dot it (What?), where to hide it?
You gotta car, better drive it
The fuck up outta here
And hope and pray I don't pull up alongside it (Come on)

[Chorus]
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my flow
Ain't no way ya niggas just don't know
Where niggas is about to go, oh-no, oh-no
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my shine
Ain't no way ya niggas wanna stop mine
Ya niggas must be out yo' mind
I don't know why

[Verse 3]
Niggas don't know, so I gotta flip
It seems they've forgotten how dark it could get
Bark like a Pit (Uh-huh), scratch when I hit  (Uh-huh)
We both know you pussy but you stay talkin' shit (Woo)
What I'ma have to do dawg? Run up in your mess (Uh-huh)
Catch you while you comfortable, put one up in your chest  (Uh-huh)
One up in yo vest, of course they the hollows
You goin' away today, just lost tomorrow (Come on)
I'ma go platinum (Nah), you gots to be kiddin', why? (What?)
Make it double platinum (Uh), no bullshittin' (Come on)
And I'ma stay flippin' flows, rippin' shows (Uh)
Strippin' hoes, gettin' dough, lettin' go (What?)
And niggas know, who the best is
The dog, DMX is, the rest is or might as well be helpless (Uh)
I'm reckless, 'cause when I wreck shit
I might snatch a nigga's necklace
Then go from like midnight to breakfast (Come on!)

[Chorus: DMX & Swizz Beatz]
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my flow
Ain't no way ya niggas just don't know
Where niggas is about to go, oh-no, oh-no
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my shine
Ain't no way ya niggas wanna stop mine
Ya niggas must be out yo' mind

But they don't, they don't, they don't, they don't—

[Verse 1: DMX]
I got blood on my hands and there's no remorse
I got blood on my dick 'cause I fucked a corpse (Come on)
I'm a nasty nigga, when you pass me nigga look me in my eyes (What?)
Tell me to my fuckin' face that you ready to die (Come on)
You be a dead motherfucker, red motherfucker (Uh)
Don't be stupid, you heard what I said motherfucker (Uh)
Who shot you? Aw nigga, like you don't know (Woo)
Stickin' you for yo' dough while I'm fuckin yo' broke ho (What?)
Yo, don't you get the picture? Niggas can't touch me (Uh)
'Cause I don't give a fuck G, I'll get you touched B
I got joints that with one slug could take apart a door
And enough crazy niggas behind me to start a war (Come on)
So what you want nigga? Help, 'cause you's about to rest (Uh)
When I'm fed, Red Cross couldn't clean up the mess
And a vest will do nothin' but make you look a little thicker (Yeah)
'Cause in the dark, you ain't nothin' but a lil' nigga (What?)
And if you'd been thinkin' about that shit you did
You wouldn't have brought the joint, wit' you kid (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
Now I'ma have to get you kid, and split your wig, wit' the machete (What?)
I bring beef to niggas, and string 'em out, like spaghetti (Come on)
You ain't ready, nor can you stand how I'm bringin' it (Uh)
How I'm givin' it is how I'm livin' it, so I'm swingin' it (Uh)
Red dot on your head, 'cause you's in mid range
Red dot on your chest, opens up your rib cage, nigga

[Chorus: P Killer Trackz]
I just love when a nigga bring his whole crew
It's just a bigger piece of cake for me to chew a hole through
I just love when a nigga bring his whole crew
It's just a bigger piece of cake for me to chew a hole through
I just love when a nigga bring his whole crew
It's just a bigger piece of cake for me to chew a hole through
I just love when a nigga bring his whole crew
It's just a bigger piece of cake for me to chew a hole through

[Verse 2: DMX]
Now if your heart was as big as your mouth, you'd be real
But it's not, so I know if you get knocked, you'll squeal
Like a bitch, 'cause you is a bitch and always been a bitch (Oh, oh, oh)
And you know how niggas do a bitch, we run up in a bitch (Woah)
Put something in a bitch, nigga do you know me? Nigga do you owe me? (Uh-huh)
Figured you could blow me? Well I'ma let this trigger fill you homie
Y'all niggas got to be smokin' somethin', thinkin' you chokin' somethin' (Uh)
Fuckin' around wit' me you'll be a broken somethin' (Woo)

How much shit could you talk wit' your lips on the floor?
Pussy niggas make me itch, so I scratch, you's a bitch (Uh, uh, uh)
So I snatch up your face, fake-ass Pit, so I scratch you (Uh, uh, come one)
Yeah there was a time, when I would've jumped up and choked this nigga
(But now) But now I'm on some shit like, "Yo, smoke this nigga" (Uh-huh)
I'm 'bout to find out how much guts you got before I spill 'em
Somebody come and get this muh'fucker before I kill him (Please)
(Ahh) Fresh out the asylum, I'm wildin'
Y'all niggas know the phone numbers for help, you best to dial 'em (Ayy)
Nine-one-one, emergency, the urgency
Will have witnesses seein' what the surgeon see (Woo)
How far you gon' get, wit' your dome split fool (Come on)
And catch your man slippin' 'cause he think his shit cool (Come on)
But it ain't, so I paint the walls with his blood (Uh, uh, uh)
Another dick in the mud, nigga, what? (Come on)

Ain't no other cats got love for me

Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats gon' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats gon' shed blood for me
But my dogs is gon' be a thug with me (Uh, uh)

[Verse 1: DMX]
If I'm gonna rob, I'ma rob all night
If I'm lookin' for somethin', it's probably a fight
If I'm gon' fuck bitches, then they better be tight
If that's dead, then the head better be right
If I gots to play, I'ma play 'til I win
Since I gots to be here, can't wait to begin
Wanna fuck shorty, can't stand shorty friend
'Cause honey friend fucked many, many men
Stay with the rats 'cause the rats is real
Wanna fuck, then we fuck, already know the deal
Shit, fuck what you look like, just show the real
And I keep a spot that we can go to chill
I love my, get down for the hoes
Only reason I come around is for the hoes
Pipework, I lay it down for the hoes
Hit 'em off with that dark brown, you know?

[Chorus: DMX]
Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats gon' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats gon' shed blood for me
But my dogs is gon' be a thug with me
Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats gon' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats gon' shed blood for me
But my dogs is gon' be a thug with me

You fuckin' with me, ain't keepin' your health right
'Cause me and my boys, we keep it jail tight
The shit I pack is heavy, but the shell's light
When they drop the same time, you drop without a fight
Burnin' anything that I'm puttin' my name on
You might take a drag, but you can't flame on
I know y'all niggas don't owe me with a chain on
When it comes to the fire, I'm the kid they blame it on
When you see like eight cars, then y'all know who we are
Niggas spittin' mean bars off the green jar
Never drunk, but you see me leaned at the bar
Spittin' fire that'll melt the ice on your arm
You had that, but for now, dog, give me that
'Cause, dog, you don't wanna see how my semi act
Fake hustlin' niggas, you'll pump any pack
When it come to this shit, I done laid plenty flat (Come on)

[Chorus: DMX]
Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats gon' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats gon' shed blood for me
But my dogs is gon' be a thug with me
Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats gon' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats gon' shed blood for me
But my dogs is gon' be a thug with me

[Refrain: DMX]
Do you hear what I tell you?
Understand what you hear
Don't let nobody tell you
What to hope and to fear
Do you hear what I tell you?
Understand what you hear
Don't let nobody tell you
What to hope and to fear (Uh, uh)

[Verse 3: DMX]
What you niggas want? 'Cause I got it right here
Y'all niggas front, then I hit you right there
Not really impressed by what niggas wear
Faggots talk shit, but I really don't care
I'm the type of nigga that'll die for the cause
Fuck what you heard, I will die for my dogs
Ain't scared of shit, will ride in the fog
Same thing, but a bigger size than yours
I fuck with Drag-On 'cause he spits the flame
Drag-On, motherfucker, don't forget the name
And we all takin' over, ain't shit the same
If you ain't out that mob, nigga, quit the game
And ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no other cats gon' bust slugs for me
Ain't no other cats gon' shed blood for me
But my dogs is gon' be a thug with me, come on

[Chorus: DMX]
Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats gon' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats gon' shed blood for me
But my dogs is gon' be a thug with me
Ain't no other cats got love for me
Ain't no cats gon' bust slugs for me
Ain't no cats gon' shed blood for me
But my dogs is gon' be a thug with me

[Refrain: DMX]
Do you hear what I tell you?
Understand what you hear
Don't let nobody tell you
What to hope and to fear
Do you hear what I tell you?
Understand what you hear
Don't let nobody tell you
What to hope and to fear

[Outro: Swizz Beatz]
Uh-huh, uh

My man
Swizz Beatz, uh
Uh, uh
Uh, uh
Uh, uh
Double-R, uh

[Intro: DMX]
Uh, yeah, yeah
*gunshots*
Uh... grrrrrrrrr... uh... hot!
Uh.. arf arf arf arf-arf

[Chorus: DMX & Swizz Beatz]
The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to fly
The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to die
The heat is on
Have your mother ready to cry
The heat is on
Huh
The heat is on
You know

[Verse 1: DMX]
The heat is on, what's my next move
Do I stick with the score, or get with the door
Feds got the drop in the back of the Uhaul
Snipers on the roof, chance of gettin' away - too small
Tell 'em like this, "Look, it's gonna be a shoot out
Whoever make it out meet back at the new house
Good luck, if I don't see you again peace
Let's handle our business with these government police"
You and you go out the front, you take the back
You cover the first two and I'll take the sack
Boomer didn't make it, neither did Stan
Now it's three niggas, splittin' four hundred grand (aight)
We all feel the loss but enjoy the profit
The game is the same, ain't nothin' gonna stop it
Most times you make it, one time you won't
All niggas could really do is have a vest under the coat (come on)

[Chorus: DMX & Swizz Beatz]
The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to fly
The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to die
The heat is on
Have your mother ready to cry
The heat is on
Huh
The heat is on
You know

[Chorus: DMX & Swizz Beatz]
The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to fly
The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to die
The heat is on
Have your mother ready to cry
The heat is on
Huh
The heat is on
You know

[Verse 2: DMX]
Me and my two mans gave money, twenty grand
For a scam, they don't get the condo in the sand
And chance of gettin' caught slim next to none
But now we like three deep, need that extra gun
Bump into my man, I remember from up north
I remember he had principles and wasn't nothin' soft
Off to discuss, just what's goin' dizzy
Everybody got it? Aight, let's get busy
Run up in the bank, bitch, *woman screams* hit the deck
Yo, bust money and get the keys off his neck (come here)
We on the clock, three minutes until we finished
Feds are on the way, but I'm tryna see spinach
In and out, duffel bag across the back
Extra large sports coat to cover up the Mac
Feds they attack, I spit lead out, niggas spread out
Run up on a civilian in his car, make him get out

[Chorus: DMX & Swizz Beatz]
The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to fly
The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to die
The heat is on
Have your mother ready to cry
The heat is on
Huh
The heat is on
You know

[Chorus: DMX & Swizz Beatz]
The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to fly
The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to die
The heat is on
Have your mother ready to cry
The heat is on
Huh
The heat is on
You know

[Verse 3: DMX]
High speed chasin', racin' through the streets
Death's in the air, I can taste it through the heat
My partner's goin' fast, I don't think he's gonna last
But if he don't, I'mma hit his wife with his half
But that's the type of nigga I am, this ain't just rappin'
I made it, he didn't, but hey, shit happens
What can I do, but go on livin'
Fleein' from the condo, I'll go on a ribbon
Life goes on, that might sound wrong, but hey
We all live by the rules of the game we play
Day to day, death is a possibility
The way I play is a vest stops you from killin' me
It's too hot to be in the heat 'cause it's on
Too hot to be in the streets, so I'm gone
Go back to bein' discreet, live long
'Til one day either me or the heat is gone
Come On!

[Chorus: DMX & Swizz Beatz]
The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to fly
The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to die
The heat is on
Have your mother ready to cry
The heat is on
Huh
The heat is on
You know

[Chorus: DMX & Swizz Beatz]
The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to fly
The heat is on
Are y'all really ready to die
The heat is on
Have your mother ready to cry
The heat is on
Huh
The heat is on
You know
The heat is on

[Intro]
This life shit, this life shit is like
Is like bugged the fuck out, son, for real
See, to live is to suffer
But to survive
Well, that's to find meaning in the suffering

[Chorus]
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

[Verse 1]
I've been through mad different phases like mazes to find my way
And now I know that happy days are not far away
If I'm strong enough I'll live long enough to see my kids
Doin' somethin' more constructive with their time than bids
I know because I been there, now I'm in there
Sit back and look at what it took for me to get there
First came the bullshit, the drama with my mama
She got on some fly shit so I split and said that I'ma
Be that seed that doesn't need much to succeed
Strapped with mad greed and a heart that doesn't bleed
I'm ready for the world or at least I thought I was
Baggin' niggas when I caught a buzz
For thinkin' about how short I was
Goin' too fast, it wouldn't last, but yo I couldn't tell
Group homes and institutions prepared my ass for jail
They put me in a situation forcin' me to be a man
When I was just learnin' to stand without a helping hand
Damn, was it my fault, somethin' I did
To make a father leave his first kid at seven doin' my first bid?
Back on the scene at fourteen with a scheme
To get more cream than I'd ever seen in a dream
And by all means I will be livin' high off the hog
And I never gave a fuck about much but my dog
That's my only mothafucka I hit off with my last
Just another lil nigga headed nowhere fast

[Chorus]
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

[Verse 2]
That ain't the half, shit gets worse as I get older
Actions become bolder, heart got colder
Chip on my shoulder that I dared a nigga to touch
Didn't need a clique 'cause I scared a nigga that much
One deep with the pit startin' shit for kicks
Catchin' vics, throwin' bricks, gettin' by bein' slick
Used to get high, just to get by
Used to have to puff my L in the morning before I could fly
Ate somethin', a couple of forties made me hate somethin'
I did some coke, now I'm ready to take somethin'
Three years later showin' signs of stress
Didn't keep my hair cut or give a fuck how I dressed
I'm possessed by the darker side, livin' the cruddy life
Shit like this kept a nigga with a bloody knife
Wanna make records but I'm fuckin' it up
I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up

[Chorus]
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

[Verse 3]
Wasn't long before I hit rock bottom
Niggas talkin' shit, like, "Damn, look how that rock got him!"
Open like a window, no more indo
Look at a video, sayin' to myself: "That coulda been yo
Ass on the TV," believe me, it could be done
Somethin's got to give, gots to change 'cause now I've got a son
I gots to do the right thing for shorty
And that means no more gettin' high, drinkin' 40s
So I get back lookin' type slick again
Fake niggas jump back on my dick again
Nothin' but love for those that know how it feel
And much respect to all my niggas that kept it real
Kept a nigga strong, kept a nigga from doin' wrong
Niggas know who they is and this is your fuckin' song
And to my boo who stuck with a nigga through
All the bullshit, you'll get yours because it's due

[Chorus]
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Ayo, I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I gots to get up
Get me back on my feet so I can tear shit up

[Outro]
See, this is that shit, this is that shit
That all real niggas can relate to
This is from the heart, baby
Don't get it twisted
X, baby

[Part 1: Prayer II]

Let us pray...
I thank you, Lord, for my birth and everything that's followed
I thank you, Lord, for today, and I will pray for tomorrow
I thank you, Lord, for the love of my life and a friend
I made a promise and I'm lovin' my wife 'til the end
I thank you, Lord, for your guidance, 'cause it's all that counts
And right here, right now... Lord, this is your house
I thank you, Lord, for a dream that came true to light
And I ask you to bless everybody in this room tonight
I don't always do the right thing and I ask you to forgive me
'Cause I need You here wit me, without You in my life it's empty
I think back how some people did me like, violence was the remedy
And because I think of that now, I pray for my enemy
Not because of what I'll do, but because they don't know
There's somethin' better after here, but everybody won't go
So I ask You to forgive them and we'll hope they see
And I thank You for the love that they've given to me
I will not abuse it nor will I lead them astray
You see I love 'em like children, that I see everyday
And I pray... no, we pray... together
Get us through the bad weather, and we love You forever
Let Your thought and my heart go hand in hand
I first thought but to start, but I stand a man
And for as long as I can, as long as You permit me
Please give me the strength I need to live, bear with me
Amen

[Part 2: Ready to Meet Him]

[Intro]
We each walk the path that we've chosen (Yes)

[Chorus]
I'm ready to meet him
'Cause where I'm livin' ain't right, black hate white
White hate black, it's right back to the same fight
They got us suspectin' a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord

[Verse 1]
Lord, You left me stranded and I don't know why
Told me to live my life, now I'm ready to die
Ready to fly, I cry, but I shed no tears
You told me You would dead those fears, it's been years
Snakes still comin' at me, just missin'
Sometimes I think all You do with me is just listen
I thought that I was special, that's what You told me
Hold me, stop actin' like You don't know me
What I do so bad that it sent You away from me?
Not only sent You away, but made You stay away from me?
"My child I'm here as I've always been
It is you who went away and now are back again
What did I say?" Follow Your word and be true
"What did you do?" Well, what I wanted to do
"What have you seen?" Darkness and hell at a glance
"What do you want?" All I want is another chance

[Chorus]
I'm ready to meet him
'Cause where I'm livin' ain't right, black hate white
White hate black, it's right back to the same fight
They got us suspectin' a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord
I'm ready to meet him
'Cause where I'm livin' ain't right, black hate white
White hate black, it's right back to the same fight
They got us suspectin' a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord

[Verse 2]
"Just because you went away, my doors are not locked
Wanna come back home? All you gotta do is knock"
You see, I left home a boy but returned as a man
Full grown and I'm still not able to stand
"I gave you a hand." Well but I was lookin' the wrong way
Figured out the plan, then I started to pray
And that prayer took me from here, over there
Back to over here, now it got me like where
Do I belong, do I fit in?
Things on my mind, where do I begin?
It's easier to sin, but it hurts my heart
I'm really tryna win, so where do we start?
"Thou shalt not steal." But what if he stole from me?
"Thou shalt not kill." But what if he's tryin' to kill me?
"Thou shalt not take my name in vain
No matter how hard it rains, withstand the pain"

[Chorus]
I'm ready to meet him
'Cause where I'm livin' ain't right, black hate white
White hate black, it's right back to the same fight
They got us suspectin' a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord
I'm ready to meet him
'Cause where I'm livin' ain't right, black hate white
White hate black, it's right back to the same fight
They got us suspectin' a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord
I'm ready to meet him

[Verse 3]
Our Father, who art in Heaven
I'm not ashamed to ask for guidance at 27
No longer afraid to knock on Your door
Not scared anymore to lose my life in the war
After what I just saw, I'm ridin' with the Lord
'Cause I really can't afford to lose my head by the sword
And now that I've seen what I need to see
Please take me where I need to be
"What have you learned?" It's better to tell the truth than to lie
"What have you learned?" To love my life until I die
"What have you learned?" Violence isn't always the key
"What have you learned?" You can't always believe what you see
"What have you learned?" It's better to forgive and forget
"What have you learned?" Give as you expect to get
"What have you learned?" That I can't go on without You
"What have you learned?" I must've been a fool to ever doubt You

[Chorus]
I'm ready to meet him
'Cause where I'm livin' ain't right, black hate white
White hate black, it's right back to the same fight
They got us suspectin' a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord
I'm ready to meet him
'Cause where I'm livin' ain't right, black hate white
White hate black, it's right back to the same fight
They got us suspectin' a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord
I'm ready to meet him

[Outro]
I'm ready to meet him
I'm ready to meet him
I'm ready to meet him
I'm ready to meet him

[Intro]
Just cause I love my niggas (Ruff Ryders)
I shed blood for my niggas (Ryde or die)
Let a nigga holla, "Where my niggas?" (Get down or lay down)
All I wanna hear is, "Right here, my niggas!" (We here nigga!)

(Background talking)

Knumskull (DMX)

Yeah Yeah, now we on the west coast (nigga)
Hooked up with my partners, Ruff Ryders
To represent the turf
Come to lay down the turf stories
To represent real brothers gettin money, on the paper chase (nigga)
We gon start off with my man, so, you know what I'm sayin, DMX let em know

DMX:
Niggas is gettin trampled on, what's all the fuss about?
Suckin my dick so hard, I'm bustin in their mouth
And then I stuff em out, four to the mid', fuck what I did
With no regard for a bid, ripped you up, while you wit your kid
Slid into the shadows, cause I'm dark like that
I bark like that, jet black, but I spark like that
Where ARE they at, when I get thirsty, shit
Ain't a nigga strong enough to stand the worst it gets
Bits, and pieces are all that's left
Niggas so scared to death, they hold they motherfuckin breath
Til I pass, cause they asked, and I smelled em
The S-P-E-L-L-E-D T-H-E-M, I spelled em
To make me have to swell one, eye up, lump up one head
Catch a body with the shottie, pump up one dead
Red alert, niggas is about to get hurt, do work
To skirts, like a jag on the merk, ARF
Night time is the right time for creepin
Vandalize your crib, rape your wife while she's sleepin
I been off the deep end, since I was semen
That's why now, I'm such a motherfuckin demon!
SCREAMIN, my bloody head off, shit on my mind I gotsta get off
Can't even hold a joint, lest I let off
A couple of rounds, from the big three pound, seven
That's about eleven hundred as of now
Chorus- (2 times)
Yukmouth (DMX):
We ride, side to side, die back to back, (nigga)
Surrounded by a wolfpack, tryin to scrap with gats
You betta ride or die, nigga ride or die, (uh huh, uh huh)
You gotta ride or die, nigga ride or die!

Drag-On:
I put a grenade in your pocket to blow your arms out
Put something black in your moms mouth, ya'll cats better calm down
This rap shit is Drag-On's now, if I catch ya'll clowns
No question what I axe (ask) ya'll clowns, I'ma gat ya'll down
For the benjamin bills, I shoulda been killed
I keeps it real though
For these plats though I leave nothin but widows
You're a gang, but so what, can you really bang with us?
Be like a phone, cause we off the hook
And ya'll better hang it up
I stay high, but I don't plan to go to heaven
I plan to burn like the furnace, til ya'll learn
Even if it's with the burners
Until your mom can dish straight, forget her son
To give her the dick, tore a clip and I stripped her one
For that's dragon, that's the one
What's blastin, that's his gun
Who's lastin, no one
So if you splashin to blow one
Like I said before, I'ma lock it down like Shaqula
So make your sister be the ??? and none back to her
Yukmouth:
After midnight, busta niggas can't even hang out
Niggas on the west, we put them dank things out
Drive by and try to blow them fuckin brains out
And cocaine drought
Survive and reside with a new clique
But use the same route
Pull the range out
Get brains pal, while I'm drivin
Live and direct, front five and a tech
Stash in the Range, but nine in the Lex
Got bitches, shining baguettes, for me
Grindin correct, for me
Signin off checks, for me
Send a bitch outta town, now she buyin the bricks, for me
Passes from the brick, homie
Keep grindin with your clique, homie
Cause on top there's no way
Cock your chromayy
Stock your monayyy
Feds caught the homayyy
It's just the monay got coppers on mayyy
Helicopters on mayyy, bust off the blockers phonayyy
Ramshack this house, put choppers on it
Bitches safe and shit, niggas takin shit
Break his wrist, pistol whip and duck tape his bitch
Chorus (2 times)

Yukmouth:
Bitch, to all my niggas locked in Rita and Simson
We still the ice cream men
Just switched it up from a truck to a great benz
We made men, and kingpins, triple-beam men
Give me a quarter key, I bet I flip a key
By the weekend, our styles are grand theiven
If not, niggas ain't leavin
Unless they bleed the demon prayer from my deacon
In front of the casket, you done it you bastard
I pack mathematics to keep it crackin
Head ride to ask it, BITCH!

DMX:
How-can-one-man-kill-so-many-and
The-sin-be-plenty-before-the-age-of-20
Life ain't worth a penny in, my book faggot
That's why I took faggot shit, I'm a crook faggot
Fat loops leather jackets, I bag it, along with
The jewels smackin tools out the hands of fools
On the strength that they don't know what they holdin
Niggas called me TAILOR cause the WAY that I be sewin
Shit up cause I get up, off my ass and SKATE
Makin more moves than U-Haul, from state to state
I speak the GREAT, and if a nigga tells you different
You turn around you ask the nigga, "FUCK is you be sniffin?"
Cause when it come to riffin, I am the riff raffin
Gots to say nuttin, niggas know they get half
And I can still laugh, at those who's toes I'm steppin on
Disrespect and pulling out a weapon on
Nice joint, I know you wish you coulda kept it on
But that's another story, don't even sweat, it's gone (echo gone)
Uh, it's that real shit yo
Grrr!

1 - Can't stop, gotta eat
Stepping on, my feet
Spread love, think it's sweet
Uh, uh, uh all you catz don't know

Repeat 1

Yeah baby, shit's about to jump off and
Lookin' for the bus to bring in my man from up north
Been like three years when he got knocked
Since he got caught, pumped up like five new blocks, holding down fort
Kept a nigga straight with money on the books
And them bitches is crooks who look out for other crooks
Took him shopping, money in his pocket, he straight
Dropped him off at the wife's crib after we ate
Out of state was the next move for me
Had to make that nigga chill for at least two to three months
Cause once it's on, it's on, he didn't care
It's like slow down baby, the money ain't going nowhere
Keep in touch though and show how much your ass is with it
The dope flow is there and in a minute you can get it (come on)
You gots to watch a nigga just coming home in a game
Cause on the low he may be trying to go against the grain
Repeat 1 (2x)

I never figured this nigga would pull this shit that he pulled
What is strange is the change some niggas go through
When they're locked down and really can't hack it
A motherfucker like me handles a bit like a jacket
Strap it on my back, but niggas ain't built like me
And by the end, niggas was like "Yo, why you killed Mike, D?"
Wasn't me, but yeah he had it coming to him
Used to be my dog, so I let my cousin do him
Sent him out of state with like half a brick down to my spot in VA
Cause the money comes quick
Half of that got fucked up before I even got the check in on him (damn)
Mistakes happen so I really wasn't wreckin' on him (damn)
Got him up out of there and sent him down a little further
Ain't heard from him in two months, murder, murder
And from the next flight thinking I might have to steal something
This hungry shit will make a nigga wanna kill something (come on)

Repeat 1 (2x)

Listen, money is missing and it's hectic (what?)
Found the safe, checked it, shit looks detected (what?)
Just what I expected when I got no word from him
Asked around but ain't nobody heard from him (uh-huh)
But money talks and most niggas is snakes
So it wasn't long before his man was ready to take
Me to where he was at, checked my gat, threw in a full clip
Pumped myself up, cause I can't go for that bullshit (come on)
Fuckin' with my last load of cash ain't the issue
It's just real fucked up when your man tries to diss you
Thinkin back for niggas in New York and how they told me so
Now I gots to knock his boots, he owes me dough
Layin' up with a ho, then he hit me with the sob story (come on)
The famous "Oh, you didn't know I got robbed?" story (come on)
Told him "It's me you should be grateful to
Fuck that bitch! Look at what she made you do"
Now there's love lost and a double cross
Pointed at that bitch, turned her brains into sauce
So you wanna be Willy (uh) and talk to me like I'm silly (yeah)
Five bottles of Moët on the floor, boxes of Phillies (uh)
Ten G's in the shoebox under the bed
And for every G I put a fuckin' slug in his head
And from then on, the moral to the story if you missed it
Is the grain will always be there, just never go against it
Repeat 1 (2x)

You cats must not know

[Introduction]
Getting down for what we stand for because it don't stop
Once the line's crossed

[Verse One]
I am from the ghetto, I don't do the disco
I just pull my pistol, take a chunk of your soul
It's me who ride up by you, police won't recognize you
Run up right behind you, and let my ratchet squeeze
And, you don't want no drama, pistol-whip your momma
Put that bitch in trauma, you don't want to war with me

[Hook]
Getting down for what we stand for because it don't stop
Once the line's crossed
Getting down for what we stand for cause it don't stop
Once the line's crossed

[Verse Two]
I don't have to use the fifth to be a threat
I stand six foot three, four thirty, any less
Motherfuckers' want their shit split, I ain't the one to test
Understand what I'm saying, if not, how I figure
Nine to your tongue while I play with the trigger
Will make you understand what I say a lot quicker
Do we have an understanding, yeah, my nigga
In case I be fronting, know they really don't want it with me
Come coming with them hollows and heaters - to put it, simply
So if your team don't follow its leader, then come, and get me
But all you cowards better believe it - you coming with me

[Hook]
Getting down for what we stand for because it don't stop
Once the line's crossed
Getting down for what we stand for cause it don't stop
Once the line's crossed

[Verse Three]
I'm known for getting up in these niggas' ass
And they don't want to, fuck with the bitch of this shit
Because I position the hits, speak with the nine
Niggas ain't ready for that shit that I spit
Oh no, get at these niggas for sure
Because once you cross the line, you already know we get dough
The quicker they slip, the quicker their ready
Holes in your Pelle, body laid up in the back of the deli
I thought you all already knew about me and these triggers
Get touched if you ever fuck with me and these niggas
The bitch is loose, got niggas like 'Bitch you loose'
I'm the realest bitch of them all
Because I get down for what I stand for

[Hook]
Getting down for what we stand for because it don't stop
Once the line's crossed
Getting down for what we stand for cause it don't stop
Once the line's crossed

[Verse Four]
Fuck I've got to say it for, you already know
I was going dizzy, I get busy with the flow
Oh, it's like that, alright, aye yo
Niggas coming through anytime, anywhere
Pop up and pop niggas, up right there
Put your man's brains in the motherfuckin air
Pop, pop, pop, you drop, drop, drop, stopping
Look at what I've done to you niggas
I don't want to be your father, tired of sonning you niggas
And, I'm sick of being bothered, I'm confronting you niggas
And take this And, run, in a minute, I'm hunting you nigga

[Hook]
Getting down for what we stand for because it don't stop
Once the line's crossed
Getting down for what we stand for cause it don't stop
Once the line's crossed

[Vita]
If ain't rough, it ain't me
Tales of the darkside, grand finale

[Ja Rule]
Ready to die, cuz only I know where it's in
And if lie to dough, then it's kill in my soul
For my love and dough, don't make it no better
Mami, don't flirt wit the iron and hit 'em whoever
A nigga that flips the weather, any Rule, J-A
Fuck wit me, it's Murda, I-N-C
Feel her, nigga, feel a hole to meet
(if it ain't rough, it ain't me)
Holla at me, my real niggas, get down, ready to kill niggas
We don't touch no more, we kill niggas
Give me what it takes to throw my guns together
Fast up, hit 'em up, towards the hot beretta
You should know better, when obviously they don't
So the shit, sure to get you one in your throat
By the time, you realize that shot's the truth
It's too late, they reminiscin' over you, my Lord

[Method Man]
Watch them young guns that take none, nobody safe from
The Friday, the 13th, ghetto Jason
Itchy trigger finger achin', snatch your ass out that S-Class for fakin'
Forty four blast, it's a bloobath, take your first step down a thug path
Ain't no love here, just slugs here, kids know the half, you get plugged here
That's just impossile, for the weak to last, now behold the unstoppable
Third eye watchin' you, watchin' me
Throwin' rocks from the penalty box, cop a plea
Young g, we was born to die, don't cry for me
Just keep the heat closely, and ride for me
Cuz we family, for better or worse, you and I
From the dirt, you snatch purse, so hard it hurt
To be here, and each year, I'm pourin' out some beer
For deceased peers, holdin' fort
Police line, do not cross, they found his corpse
In the loft, wit the head cut off, and butt naked
Homicide, the crime method, add another
Killer verse to the murder record, the grand finale

[Nas]
Hot corners, cops wit warrants, every block is boring
Friday night, gettin' bent, lick a poem
My dog, not even home a month yet, and blaze a girl
In the stomach, he robbin niggas who pumpin
Lil' Blood got popped, by the Group Home cat
Everybody nervous in the hood, pullin they gats
Fiend yellin out, who got those?  Go and see
Shorty snot-nosed, he don't floss but he got dough
Thug faces, fugitives runnin from court cases
Slugs shootin past for the love of drug paper
Queens cap peelers, soldiers, drug dealers
And God'll throw a beam of lightning down cause he feel us
May the next one, strike me down if I'm not the realest
The Mayor wanna call the SWAT team to come and kill us
But, dogs are friends, if one see the morgue, one'll live
To get revenge, and we ride to the end
Bravehearts blow the lye with Henn, and still rise
Took alive with live men, my man got three six-to-eighteen's
And only five in, the Belly of the beast Didn't wanna hear the shit
I tried to tell him on the streets
It's irrelevant, the beast love to eat black meat
And got us niggas from the hood, hangin off his teeth
We slangin to eat, bringin the heat
Bulletholes, razor scars is the pain in the street, huh

[Chorus: Vita]
If it ain't rough, it ain't' me
Down for dice, is what you told me
If it ain't rough, it ain't me
See, chick from the other side, grand finale

[Vita]
My dogs for life, call for life, now who be the job like fuck Totti
Slim weight, petite, body, down for my niggas, quick to pull a shotty
Sprayin' everybody, lacin' the whole party
Holdin' wall when my niggas hung, wit I rush
Like boys that I do know, it's me I trust
Now watch how I tie bust, guarantee I be sittin' down
Waitin' to hear up, wit the blast
Got you niggas snitchin' weed in my stash, high flow
Over the bitch who knows to stash weed
Cold for you bitches who try to oppose me
Hot Totti, same chick in Belly
Ooh, if it ain't it ain't me

[DMX]
Uhh, I've lost my grip on reality or so it would seem
Pinch myself to wake up, cause I KNOW it's a dream
Niggas that don't know me see me and think I'ma rob em
Niggas that know me well see me and think I'ma problem
I'm just a nigga that's misunderstood
But word to God I turn your last name to Underwood
Cause if I see it, I'ma take it and run with it, that's me
What type of bullshit is this nigga on?  That's D
The dog come and getcha outside
The more blood flows, when I plug holes with the snub nosed
Gun blows, bullets whistle, wouldn't miss you
Hit you all up in your mouth like it tried to kiss you
Drama, it's right here, how MUCH YOU NEED?
Beat you down with gat see how MUCH YOU BLEED
How MUCH YOU PLEAD, for your life, you was a killer
And all the bitches comin up out that ass you feelin, gettin realer
Now beg for your life, one more time, one more crime
One more nine, c'mon cry nigga
It's over!  This is the shit, that hits hard
You either the last one standing, or the last one to fall

[Verse 1]
The born loser, not because I choose to be
But because all the bad shit happens to me
I got kids, but their mothers don't want them to know me
Sisters used to like me but now they call me "homie"
Used to have a family, now I'm out on my own
Had to scrap with a pit because I tried to take his bone
Bitches don't like me, they don't kiss me or hug me
They call me "kill pretty" because I'm mad ugly
I used to get pussy, but I busted off quick
Now I gets none so I gotta beat my dick
Times are hard in the ghetto, I gotta steal for a living
Eating turkey-flavored Now & Laters for Thanksgiving
If that ain't enough, life is rough I swear
I don't have an address so I can't get welfare
They kicked me out the shelter because they said I smelled a
Little like the living dead and looked like Helter Skelter
My clothes are so funky, they're bad for my health
Sometimes at night my pants go to the bathroom by themself
Even when I was little nothing went my way
I got beat up and chased home from school every day
And despite the fact I won all the spelling bees
On my report card, I didn't get F's, I got Z's
But for those who choose to snooze
Cause I was born with no hope, I got nothing to lose

[Hook]
Young man went out and made a name for himself
Young man went out and made a name for himself
Young man went out and made a name for himself

[Verse 2]
The born loser, a title I was branded with
Went to Liberty Island, and got stranded with
The Statue of Liberty, but they didn't really have to
Leave my black ass there until the day after
No time for laughter, this shit's for real
Ribs are showing through my back cause I haven't had a meal
In about a week, you can see bones in my hands
The raccoons beat me to the garbage cans
I'm starving Marvin, and it shouldn't be like that
The only thing that I'm carving is an alley cat
But sometimes in the daytimes I dream of a Manwich
But all I'm really eating is an oxygen sandwich
For those that don't know, that's two pieces of bread slapped together
Or I'll have a rain sandwich, depending on the weather
Born Loser caught up in the game
And I ain't even got nobody to blame

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
The Born Loser, yeah, that used to me my M-O
When I couldn't get a soul to listen to my demo
Doors shut in my face until I started jamming them
I'm behind the doors now and I'm the one slamming them
I did what I had to to get where I got
Though I'll admit what I had to do was a lot
I still gave it a shot, and sometimes I had to shoot
Catching vics just to get a little loot
I thought it was cute and didn't care who knew
Mess around, get in my way and I'll bag you, too
Cause I was born to lose straight from the beginning
In the dugout because I struck out the first inning
Winning was everything, that's why I had to
Ask my man to find the loot, and he said "I'd be glad to"
Now who needs a major label? We got our own
I'm the Divine Master of the Unknown
Ain't nothing changed, I'm the same as before
When opportunity knocked I just answered the door
Criminal at heart even though I don't show it
I was always a winner but I just didn't know it

[Hook]
Intro: Styles:
What! Niggas can't fuck with us
DMX:
Get at me dog. My niggas
Styles:
That's my word!

Verse One: DMX

I'm the type to kick back and look at shit
'cause crooked shit gets me amped
And what you don't know, will get you locked in sleep away camp
Grand champ and raise more hell, than a Sorrel
See you at the peephole, bustin' at the doorbell
Though I wasn't coming without mine
You put me on the front line because you doubt mine
Bet your and lost yours, you come to get your I tossed yours
And it cost yours, fuck y'all niggas stupid, I'm the boss dog
What more dirt must I do, plus my crew
Busts at you, and you be like "What's that oooh"
What's that Clue, do I bring the noise what
Destroy these mutts, is these niggas toys or what
Bring all the pretty niggas thinking they shitty, what a pity
Lemme show them niggas shitty some pity, but for fifty
A motherfucker will get a bullet to hum to him, put the gun to him
Hit 'em with something that comes to him, bet it runs through him
Look at what I done to him, no more smiles
Got the whole top half of his head, running wild
But you don't hear me though, so I turn out the lights
We can take it to the streets dog, turn off the mics
If you want war, then you want more, than you can stand
And this 44, will leave you with your dick in the sand
Who the man, and now you cats know for real
Get at me dog, (bark), what the deal
Verse Two: Styles

Y'all niggas fucking with the L.O.X
Your stuck on a rock
Got that Alcatraz flow
You just don't know
Lifetime kid caged in blazin'
Any type of rapper or federal agent
Paniro the made man, blade man
Stand up type of guy, your living a lie
Niggas wanna be pretty and fly but kiddies will die
The dogs run the city, bet fifty on mine
Two grams for you to sniff, how silly am I
Got a lot of jokes don't, kill yo ass won't I
Maybe not if the spot is filled up with po 9
Many niggas get it confused, blame the rules
Only ask the how's not the who's
Better off busting your tool, then we might get the crew
But as far as rap goes, you a motherfucking fool
If you don't want chips, you should have stayed in school
You and 8-ball nigga, you wanna play pool
I'll put you in the side pocket, look at the size of my rocket
Styles don't lie, cop the work then clock it
Boxes full of boots, jeans, suits and watches
Niggas don't pump if they can't make a profit
Stop it, before we pull it back then cop it
Vacant lot niggas come through then we lock it
(WHAT, WHAT, WHAT)
Verse Three: Jadakiss

With no Glocks I'm in your town with five locks
Take five blocks, come back with five trucks, with knots
It's the L.O.X, three niggas that listen and watch
And nigga you know, whenever we spit, it's hot
It be that new flow, my niggas, fly niggas
Always high niggas, ready to die niggas
As far as I'm hearing, y'all doing a lot of comparing
Lemme get the one clearance like a sample
'Kiss is the champ and I know that you don't wanna get stamped
Left somewhere cramp, so when it rains, you get damp
Niggas is done, since poppy raised his son
When bringing in drums, to bring all g's to bums
Whether you can flow or not ain't the issue
You don't Jay to kiss you, his lyrics pierce the gristle
Take a puff then a swig
Think about how I'm gonna
Hold it down for Big, my motherfucking nig
Your money is low, and your flow been late
While I be coming through with new shit with temp plates
The only higher than money, is respect
The only thing hotter than my click, is a tek
So when I hit you with these last bars around your neck
You gonna know never to fuck around with L-O-X nigga
(WHAT, YEAH)
Verse Four: Sheek Luchion

My bank account be doubling
While you niggas stay in trouble and
L.O.X. stay fly
Three niggas jig-I
Shit you never seen before, Feds hit the repo law
Kingpin, 10 mil. each of us popular
It's Sheek baby
Chicks hate to see me on the Soul Train
With Don Cornelius
And all they got is alias
To work with
To catch Sheek, y'all niggas besta work quick
Now that I'm eating right, plus living well
So nowadays when I burp, it's fettucini you smell
Ain't that right poppa-san, used to push a Nissan
With a black master full 850 full suspension
While you collect your pension, I ain't worked in years
My stomach is fat from Puerto Rican food, while yours is scarce
Small black haired, chinky-eyed Puerto Rican mama
Keep them laced in the scadda, half the closet on product
I learn things, just by watching y'all niggas make the wrong moves
Now I know what not to do, to make more than y'all fools
Y'all think we ignorant, 'cause we don't budge unless we benefit
Cats that take the light that's scarce and see what's at the end of it
P.H. me, because a nigga wisks me up in Jake B
Your shit be so-so, low pro
On a bus before the cars show
On some old joystick shit, no mirrors
I can see behind me through the cameras
Flip plates, make the whole block go bananas

[Chorus: Jadakiss]
Uhh, used to be my dawg, you was in my left titty
Screamed, “Ryde or Die!”, I thought you would die wit' me
Found out you a bitch, you can’t even ryde wit' me
Now it’s a war, and you ain’t on the side wit' me
Used to be my dawg, you was in my left titty
Screamed, “Ryde or Die!”, I thought you would die wit' me
Found out you a bitch, you can’t even ryde wit' me
Now it’s a war, and you ain’t on the side wit' me

[Verse 1: DMX]
When it rain, niggas get wet, so stay dry (uh)
Don't cross me, I can peep a snake eye (woo)
You just lost me, like yo' shadow in the dark (uh-huh)
Fucked around and forced me to hit the shadow with the spark (UHH)
Blew your shit apart -- now it's two halves of one nigga
"Look at him," I said after a few laughs, "Dumb nigga!
Stupid is as stupid does, cocksucker, (WHAT?)
And look what being stupid does: gets you shot, sucker!" (WHAT?)
I let you get too close and you bit me (uh)
I closed my eyes for too long, you tried to hit me
Thought you was wit me (uhh)
Well you might as well forget me 'cause from this point on (uh-huh)
It's war, it won't stop until one of us is gone (c'mon!)
I'm still mad at myself for lettin' that shit go down (UHH)
Somebody shoulda told me I was fuckin' wit a clown (aight?)
And I think they found and let you niggas drown...
.. you know how shit get around

[Chorus: Jadakiss]
Uhh, used to be my dawg, you was in my left titty
Screamed, “Ryde or Die!”, I thought you would die wit' me
Found out you a bitch, you can’t even ryde wit' me
Now it’s a war, and you ain’t on the side wit' me
Used to be my dawg, you was in my left titty
Screamed, “Ryde or Die!”, I thought you would die wit' me
Found out you a bitch, you can’t even ryde wit' me
Now it’s a war, and you ain’t on the side wit' me

[Verse 2: Styles P]
Aiyyo X fuck them niggas, them niggas ain't your dogs
Better treat like some cats and shake they ass to the floor
Been seen the foul shit, put the guns in em
Lil' wannabe you's, so why you run wit em?
You can't trust niggas no further than you can throw em
You don't wanna murder the niggas, then you blow em
He usin yo' style, that make him yo' child
Then he shouldn't make a move til he hear it from yo' mouth
We don't allow snakes - runnin wit dogs
Tell them ain't nuttin like a funeral that's gonna be yours
Double-R, and I ain't here to start trouble God
But if they wasn't your niggas I woulda BEEN hit em hard
Niggas look like they phony (what) sound like they phony (huh?)
Run around actin like motherfucker's homies
We all make mistakes, that's part of the breaks
But you can still call the apes, we bringin the duct tape
And the broomstick -- them bitch-ass niggas is gettin raped
Know how we ride, whoever on they side can die
And we ain't tryin to be blind, fuck eye for eye
Cause we only takin yours, you know the doggs you motherfucker

[Chorus: Jadakiss]
Uhh, used to be my dawg, you was in my left titty
Screamed, “Ryde or Die!”, I thought you would die wit' me
Found out you a bitch, you can’t even ryde wit' me
Now it’s a war, and you ain’t on the side wit' me
Used to be my dawg, you was in my left titty
Screamed, “Ryde or Die!”, I thought you would die wit' me
Found out you a bitch, you can’t even ryde wit' me
Now it’s a war, and you ain’t on the side wit' me

[Verse 3: DMX]
There was always somethin there, but I just couldn't touch it (uh-huh)
Wasn't somethin that would hurt me, so a nigga said, "Fuck it!" (uhh)
I let it slide, laughed and joked let it ride (true)
Now that you done killed it, I'm glad that it died (AIGHT?)
It's aight, I know where you live, I'm just waitin (uhh)
Til we knock on your front door, and let you meet Satan (c'mon!)
That's what you get for hatin -- FUCK YOU FAGGOT! (WHAT?)
I never did trust you faggot -- I'll bust you faggot! (WHAT?)
What you done forgot about the streets is this: (uhh)
You do a grimy nigga like you do a grimy bitch (AIGHT?)
You just STOP fuckin wit him, you got no more rap (uh)
No more, "Yo whassup D?", no more dap (uhh)
Be lucky if I don't spit in your face, off of G.P. (WHAT?)
AND WHAT? Bitch-ass nigga, you can't beat me (woo)
Don't take it as a loss, just take it as a lesson:
Next time think twice, or get iced wit the Wesson, nigga! (Nigga!)

[Chorus: Jadakiss]
Uhh, used to be my dawg, you was in my left titty
Screamed, “Ryde or Die!”, I thought you would die wit' me
Found out you a bitch, you can’t even ryde wit' me
Now it’s a war, and you ain’t on the side wit' me
Used to be my dawg, you was in my left titty
Screamed, “Ryde or Die!”, I thought you would die wit' me
Found out you a bitch, you can’t even ryde wit' me
Now it’s a war, and you ain’t on the side wit' me

[Outro: Jadakiss & DMX]
C'mon
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah (Uhh)

[Intro: DMX]
Flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood
Flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood!

[Chorus: DMX]
Flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood
All my niggas get down like what
Flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood
All my niggas get down like what

[Verse 1: DMX]
My dogs is dogs with official bloodlines
I say "Stop Being Greedy," get a plate, you want mine
Why do niggas always force you take it back to the streets?
Can I at least go one year without spitting the heat?
Motherfuckers think it's sweet until you get your chest messed up
Two days later he's dressed up, let him rest up
He ain't going nowhere, no time soon
Remember High Noon? Last thing he heard was "Boom"!
Can I get some room or do I gots to, make me a path?
Break you in half, fake niggas make me laugh
Y'all niggas is funny, still talking 'bout money
And ain't got none, get the shotgun 'cause you hungry
It's about to get ugly when the, lights is out
One, two, three, ho that's three strikes you out
His knife was out, I think they found it still in his hand
He in a bag and I'm over here, killing his man!

[Chorus: DMX]
Flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood
All my niggas get down like what
Flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood
All my niggas get down like what

[Verse 2: DMX]
I no longer see the shadows that once kept me strong
And I'm starting to get that same feeling that kept me wrong
Can't afford to trust niggas cause niggas lust figures
Plus niggas is scared to bust niggas, rush niggas
Dueling with the heat, and ain't killing nothing but time
Fucking with the street, but you ain't feeling nothing but mine
Tired of hearing niggas rhyme that don't say shit
Fuck is on them niggas minds, why don't they quit?
Sucking my dick looking for something new
Let your man hold something with your hold something crew
You know how niggas do, we don't forget shit
If you was there when it's thin, then you there when it's thick
No hitchhikers, fuck that, the Ryde was Ruff
And every nigga that was wit us, that died was Ruff
A lot of niggas that are wit us, ain't cried enough
So now when niggas come and get us, we fires em up

[Chorus: DMX]
Flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood
All my niggas get down like what
Flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood
All my niggas get down like what

[Verse 3: DMX]
Motherfuckers, thought that the, X would stop
But I got niggas like, "Yo, who's the next to drop?"
From his camp, get the stamp, grand champ, it's official
Think when you die how many's gon' miss you
Lean over in your casket and kiss you
Send you on your way with a blessing
And pray that another learned a lesson
Smith and Wesson ended money's life, now money's wife's a widow
(Gave it to him full blast?) Nah dog, just a little
Beside rap I don't talk but make plenty of moves
I'll murder, ten of you fools before your men and them choose
You either, win or you lose, and I, love to win
Even if it means I gotta shed blood again
Keep the bank account doubling, but don't hate me
Really thought that what you said would either, make me or break me?
Knowin it don't take me long to write
Matter of fact, I think I'll drop another, song tonight

[Chorus: DMX]
Flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood
All my niggas get down like what
Flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood
All my niggas get down like what

[Intro]
Yea, (another gutter...) you know we had to do it this time baby! Nah-mean?
My nigga D, we walk through the motherfucking' doors
Of the industry together baby! Nah-mean? (Gots to tell the truth)
You gave that shit dog, Ya know what I'm sayin?
Me like yo, go hard on these niggas baby, Nah-mean? (Gots to tell the truth)
Go hard just let niggas know
What the fuck is really going on
Now that's what the fuck I did! Aight!
Arf, Arf. What!

[Verse 1]
The industry; man its not the same
The industry; its not a fucking game
The industry; real niggas is dying to get in
The industry; just to find they don't fit in
The industry; ain't what it used to be
The industry; trying to control the way you MC
They want you to dress like that this and talk like that
But I'm gon' dress like this and talk with the bat
The industry; got y'all word meaning nothing
The industry; fuck what you heard cause he's bluffing
The industry; money, bitches, hate
But I dare you to try to take a fucking thing off my plate
The industry like "Wait!", but in the streets we like "Get 'em"
Seventeen up in that thing, catch 'em sleeping and hit 'em
And Ima pop whoever with 'em, the coroner is coming to get 'em
Industry niggas, so that's how I did 'em

[Hook]
The industry; mad niggas is full of shit
The industry; mad niggas is sucking dick
The industry; bitches keep thinking its a game
The industry; don't mention my fucking name
The industry; mad niggas is full of shit
The industry; mad niggas is sucking dick
The industry; bitches keep thinking its a game
The industry; don't mention my fucking name, nigga

[Verse 2]
The Industry; if you ain't got a strong mind
The industry; will break you down its a matter of time
The industry; vultures with nothing to feast on
The industry; see me I'm getting my beast on
The industry; staying in the dirt, playing in the dirt
Touch the wrong one in the industry and you will get hurt
I'm not an industry artist, I'm an artist in the industry
That's why I do what the fuck I want, cause nobody can finish me
The industry; wanted dead or alive
New artist to sell they souls, the way they survive
The industry don't give a fuck about you
But the industry couldn't make a dime without you
The industry; I'm sick of this industry shit
The industry; playing you like a industry bitch
They try to finish me quick but I am long, so I stand strong
Fuck a beat, listen to the words of the damn song

[Hook]

[Outro (over hook)]
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh (2X)
Shit is crazy yo
They loaning you money to make a album
You pay 'em back the money, they still on the album
What part of the game is that? (I tell you the truth, I don't lie)
You write your own shit, but they hold on to your shit
What part of the game is that?
(I don't try to hurt nobody, I mind my business)
You know what, the average nigga makes like
(All these industry niggas could suck a fucking dick!!)
Twenty-six cents over a motherfucking record
We need a motherfucking union baby!!!

__________________________________________________________

[Outro from performance on Def Poetry Jam]

Often, my words fall on deaf ears
Motherfuckers be listenin' but don't hear
Talkin' to 'em and they be sittin' right here
I be like "Where you goin'!?", nigga be like "Yeah"

[Intro]
Live and learn
Life's a lesson (life is a lesson)
And I'm the teacher

[Hook]
First I'm gonna crawl, uh (crawl)
Then I'm gonna walk, uh huh (walk)
Then I'm gonna stand, uh huh (stand)
Then I'm gonna talk, uh (talk)
What I gotta learn, what (learn)
In order to teach, (teach)
Then I gotta burn (burn)
In order to reach (reach), my nigga

[Verse 1]
Yo, I see what I see, day by day
Hopin that the Lord can, pave my way
Have I been forgotten, have I forsaken
Or maybe I'm just wrong with the moves that I've been makin
Hatin others cuz they hate me, over envy
Wanna send me, when we used to be friendly
Think I started off on top? With multi-platinum albums?
Naw dog, I started off on the block
I just did shit to get shit
Niggas always knew I was down to hit shit
That's why I stay wit shit
Played with shit, but it wasn't a game
First time locked down, wasn't the same
A whole new world, nothin but clothes to steal
Niggas gettin split for real, miss a good meal
Can't call nobody, cuz don't nobody care
They got my back against the wall, fuck it I'm just here

[Hook]
First I'm gonna crawl
Then I'm gonna walk
Then I'm gonna stand
Then I'm gonna talk
What I gotta learn?
In order to teach
Then I gotta burn
In order to reach, (my nigga)

[Verse 2]
Dog it's like this, when the fog is type thick
A nigga might flip, and a nigga bite quick
But I stay focused on what's important
Supportin my family, fuckin with my dogs and recording
According to the man upstairs, we all got our own problems
So you, stop worryin about theirs
Learned a long time ago, look away, niggas'll leave you
I hear none, speak none, see no, evil
All I can do is teach you, what I know
How I flow, how I get down, where I go
Maybe what I been through, will send you
Somewhere, other then where, dreams all out the window
I love my people, all of my people
And God gon keep me callin my people
You gots to live life to the fullest
It ain't always about the size of the gun, sometimes it's the bullet

[Hook]
First I'm gonna crawl
Then I'm gonna walk
Then I'm gonna stand
Then I'm gonna talk
What I gotta learn?
In order to teach
Then I gotta burn
In order to reach, (my nigga)

[Verse 3]
Every day we live and learn, take it step by step
And we create our own path, until there's no life left
I hold my death, off for as long as I can
Knowin my man, is plottin with the chrome in his hand
Supposed to be fam, but niggas get shady over money
My nigga, pull out the 380 over money
Crazy over money, can't do without it
I got other shit to deal with, I'm like forget about it
It's the one I don't know but must teach that comes first
Because he comes with the thirst of a nigga that had it the worst
It's like a curse that's to be lifted, he was there but he drifted
Got a call and he shifted, once he found out he was gifted
Gotta kick it from the heart, and I hope you got it
It was there from the start, I just hope you spot it
Cuz it's my blood on paper, my soul on paper
Words to live by will leave a hole in the paper

[Hook]
First I'm gonna crawl
Then I'm gonna walk
Then I'm gonna stand
Then I'm gonna talk
What I gotta learn?
In order to teach
Then I gotta burn
In order to reach, (my nigga)

[Intro: DMX]
Ok! Uh, yo, yo, grrr, yo, uh huh
You know how we do, (Talk to 'em baby) nahmean
Smack niggas around (Talk to 'em baby) nahmean
Let 'em know, (Talk to 'em baby) it's my motherfuckin house nahmean
(Talk to 'em baby) Let these motherfuckers know aight

[DMX]
Aiyyo, don't fuck with dog, dog is a beast
X, only nigga get love in the streets
Shit done fell off straight from the horse
Bullshit, gettin four mics in the Source
I can't respect that, it's just how I feel
You know the truth when you hear it, it's for real
Come on, what the deal? Like it don't show
Wooo! Yall niggas gon' feel it when you comin back
Man, you niggas play too many games
Too many jokes, what I said? Too many names
Provoke situations, but do me the same
And I'll show how a nigga stay true to the game
You gots to be more careful, like Terry Woods
I'm a nigga that can pass through every hood
Up to no good, that show you wool
Bitch, X got pull, that's how I get down, pitbull

[Chorus: Lil' Scrappy]
Watch that nigga; get stomped the fuck down
Watch that ho; get dragged the fuck out
Damn that nigga; get knocked the fuck down
Bitch ass nigga; get laid the fuck out
Do somethin nigga; to get you stomped down
Do somethin bitch; to get you dragged out
Do somethin nigga; to get you knocked out
Step up bitch, get laid the fuck out

[DMX]
Stop the bullshit cause ain't nothin funny
Yall cats is only in this for the money
It's all good when the check drops
But it's back to the hood when the check stops
You never left, you ain't gots to worry about comin back
Wooo! Yall niggas gon' feel it when you comin back
And I'll be there doin my thing
Fuckin wit cruddy niggas keep pumpin the game
Ask around, difference between me and you
Is I get at 'em, my friends you know what I do
Listen, don't play with me that way
Cause faggot, I can end it all today, fuck what you sayin
Play fair with men, act like one
Talk like a bitch and get smacked like one
Got rabbit in 'em, get jacked like one
Make the call, hit me back like done

[Chorus: 2x]

[DMX]
You always been the son type nigga
Scared to pull a gun type nigga
Talk shit and run type nigga
Seek through the fake shit and sniff out the bullshit
From a mile away so put the smile away
X gon' give it to ya, I go hard
Bitch, my name rings bells in the yard
Check my resume, track record is offical
Uh, Ruff Ryderz, DMX, Swizz Beatz

[Verse 1]
I be, I be that dog that gots to flow
That's why, that's why baby I gots to blow
And you, and you know it's straight from the gutter
Because, because it's gettin darker than a mother
Slow down, slow down partner you movin too quick
Oh now, oh now gotcha, your crew and them sick
What now, what now nigga, you feelin this shit?
But how, but how is this nigga killin this shit
Don't think, don't think that it couldn't happen again
Don't blink, don't blink cuz I put a gat in your chin
Then what, then what niggas is gonna see you dead
For what, for what over some shit a bitch said
But why, but why did your life mean so liitle?
I tried, I tried but you got me caught up in the middle
This is, this is what it all comes down to
I did, I did what a nigga had to do, come on

[Hook]
Don't worry 'bout me
Cuz I'm a be the dog that I am, you know, D
The type of nigga that y'all niggas love when you see
So y'all, don't worry bout me, ya hear me?

[Verse 2]
What's up, what's up with that nigga they call D?
I am, I am what niggas is tryin to be
And will, and will continue to do my thing
They love, they love all that dark shit that I bring
Know why, know why? Cuz I keep it realer than you
You can't, you can't cuz of all the shit that you do
You know, you know just what I'm talkin about
You asked, you asked nothin bout runnin your mouth
A bitch, a bitch what you thought niggas couldn't tell?
You flipped, you flipped after two days in a cell
Good thing, good thing I knew what was on your mind
You sing, you sing but you still gon do your time
No bail, no bail cuz they don't believe your story
Oh well, oh well guess you gon do that forty
I'm here, I'm here still gettin platinum plaques
You there, you there still tryin to watch your back

[Hook] X 4
It's dark, and hell is hot

[Chorus]
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when it's on, 'cause when it's on
You niggas know to be gone
Every time, 'cause we don't play

[Verse 1]
"Who turned out the lights?" is what niggas be sayin'
Now you don't wanna fight, but y'all niggas be playin'
Thinkin' it's alright, keep playin' with that role
And you gonna know the night, when you layin' in that hole
Dirt gettin' tossed in yo' grave, now it's all over
Preacher said "You was brave," but now it's all over
You just one of the many, plenty, I done gave it to
Ain't no savin' you
No matter how many tears your moms cried
Ain't gon' bring yo' ass back, plus in hell you gon' fry
Why? But now the only two relative questions
Is "Do we bury him or burn? Any suggestions?"
Either way, you up out of here for good
Now when niggas mention your name they knockin' on wood (Aight)
Did I, get my, point across?
Another body on the shottie, another joint I toss

[Chorus]
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when it's on, 'cause when it's on
You niggas know to be gone
Every time, 'cause we don't play
Every time, 'cause we don't play
Every time, 'cause we don't play

[Verse 2]
It ain't no sunshine when the Dark Man comes out
And I want mine, so I plan to keep my gun out
We got four 9s, so niggas run in and run out
But I bust mine, 'cause I'd like to hear some shouts
Get at me dog, niggas know how it's goin dizzy
When it comes to that flow, I gets busy
Who is he? Dark Man, of the unknown
(Grrr, argh) One dog, one bone
Now who ain't goin' home? Looks like you
You hear strike one, talkin' shit, strike two
Won't be a strike three, 'cause I don't play fair
I'ma look you in your eye while he hit you from the rear
Be like, "Yeah", holdin' you up 'cause you fallin' (What?)
The Lord ain't comin', so nigga stop callin'
You was ballin', a minute ago, in it for dough
'Til it was, "Yo, I swear to God, I didn't know"

[Chorus]
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when it's on, 'cause when it's on
You niggas know to be gone
Every time, 'cause we don't play
Every time, 'cause we don't play
Every time, 'cause we don't play

[Verse 3]
And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
What you think you gon' get, fuck around with my dough?
Just so it ain't no mistakes, this is my show
One (one), two (two), three, here I go
Your shit is quick, and your shit is slick, but this shit is thick
And you hear this shit? Damn right, I can finish shit
If you caught that verse without a rewind you can see mine
But you'll be blind, I'll do it 360 and come up from behind
Tap you on your shoulder, have you turnin' around
Hit you with somethin' that'll have you burnin' the ground
Be like, "Damn, ain't nothin' left of money, but a pile of ash"
Life is good, so please enjoy it while it lasts
'Cause you know ain't got much longer to go
The quicker you go depends on the stronger the flow
Well niggas know, I don't give a fuck, right or wrong
There ain't no sunshine when it's on

[Chorus]
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when it's on, 'cause when it's on
You niggas know to be gone
Every time, 'cause we don't play
Every time, 'cause we don't play
Every time, 'cause we don't play

See it takes a snake to spot a snake
And by the time they spot the snake
God shot the snake (uh)
I got to get what ever I can get my hands on
Fuck you niggas (what) is what I'ma stand on
It's a king thing, what goes around comes back around

(Verse)
It ain't about talkin' the talk
Just walkin' the walk (uhhuh)

Ride out!
They want war (What)
But you really don't know what you asking for (Come on)

[DMX]
Yo, you remember the first time we rocked sound stage
When the world was ready to let the dog out the cage?
Covered the whole crowd rocking from here to there
All you said was "throw your hands in the air!"
You'se a hype man nigga (What) I started you dude
You have bitches part of your crew that's harder than you
Let me tell you what niggas in jail say across that table
That you are the cutest bitch on your label
Only records you got are the ones you signing on (la la la)
Never been to jail, never had a block you were slanging on
We all rode with killers just think
But you, come on dog, the only thing you murdered was inc
You got to watch the shit you say to niggas
Sitting over there smiling, but pussy, I don't play with niggas
I'm about to make you a fucking believer
Next time send your man in your place cause I don't battle divas

[Hook 2x]

Time's up! What the fuck? That's the verdict
Cats spit some weak shit, dog done heard it
That's the best you can come up with? Fucking faggot
I'ma bout to run up quick, run up cliques (click, boom)
All you cats do is talk trash
And I got 50 that says Alicia Keys will bust your ass
What you about a buck 5? Buck 6?
I'm coming right for you nigga, can't duck this
Me jealous for what? You don't even know
The way you be running around dancing in bitches videos
You're embarrassing me junior, I loved you like a son
You been on my dick since "4, 3, 2, 1"
How the fuck you supposed to be the head of your crew
When everybody with you flow better than you?
You do it like this, since you gotta have dick to swing on
I got a blazing R&B joint you can sing on

[Hook: 2x]

Come on, come on
Uh, uh
What the fuck is wrong with this nigga man?
Fuck, don't he know?
Doesn't he fucking know?
We gon find out today
Arf, arf, arf, arf, arf, arf

[Intro]
This is my life (Right, wrong)

[Hook]
Whatever which way they go (Right, wrong)
Whatever which way they go (Right, wrong)
Whatever which way they go (Right, wrong)
Whatever which way they go (Right, wrong)

[Verse 1]
You made me a leader before I was ready to lead
Took away my hunger but didn't give me greed
Made me successful when I just wanted to be heard
Give me the light, 'cause all I need is the word
Give me a life that I'm responsible for
I'll give Him what's right, 'cause I'm responsible for Him
And into the night, I'm gonna be there with Him
Facin' a fight, I be right there with Him
I'm ready for Heaven, 'cause I done been through the Hell
And since I was seven, I've had a story to tell
See, God is great, and that's why I'm still livin'
He gave to me, so I'ma keep on givin'
The bravery of a man's mind in slavery (Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
Is makin' me the man I was made to be (What?)
I hate to see when cats know but don't spit it
Right is wrong, when it's on you gon' get it (C' mon)

[Hook]
(Right, wrong)
Whatever which way they go (Right, wrong)
Whatever which way they go (Right, wrong)
Whatever which way they go (Right, wrong)
Whatever which way they go (Right, wrong)

[Verse 2]
I wake up frustrated, dawg, I'm hurtin' inside
Thinkin' about the brothers that put in work and then died
A certain have tried, a certain have cried
When it didn't go right, You hit me like—
You see, things ain't always what they seem to be
And the reason I dream of thee is He's with me
And the reason I get through things so easily
Is by the grace of God 'cause He sees the need to guide me
Walk right beside me
Because He knows what's goin' on inside me, He tried me (What?)
Knew where my heart was at, knew what I was thinkin' (Uh)
Knew when I was down and out, left dead and stinkin' (Uh, uh)
Knew when to pick me up 'cause it got too hard (Woo)
Knew when I was gonna scream out: "Please God!" (God)
And You already knew that You would be there for me
That's why I bring You together to give You the glory

[Hook]
(Right, wrong)
Whatever which way they go (Right, wrong)
Whatever which way they go (Right, wrong)
Whatever which way they go (Right, wrong)
Whatever which way they go (Right, wrong)

[Verse 3]
Everyday of life is a new chapter
And it's already been foretold, so it's up to the soul to capture
The essence of it all, the meek shall inherit the Earth
Destined to ride with the call from birth
The true worth of a man is not measured by what he does for himself, but what he does for someone else
And if you help another, without concern for a reward or gold
What you give, you shall recieve tenfold (Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
And I put that on my soul, and put that on my life
And everything I own, and everything I know
And everything I show is what I was meant to do
Everything I told you is what I've been through
And everywhere I been, I was for a reason
Walked through the desert, ended up freezin'
Start there, end up where? And now they know
Whatever which way they go (Right, wrong)

[Hook]
Whatever which way they go (Right, wrong)
Whatever which way they go (Right, wrong)
Whatever which way they go (Right, wrong)
Whatever which way they go (Right, wrong)
Whatever which way they go (Right, wrong)
Whatever which way they go (Right, wrong)
Whatever which way they go (Right, wrong)

[Outro]
Whatever which way they go
They know they gonna owe
They soul to the road they choose
It don't matter if you win or lose
You still gotta pay them dues
You still gotta pay them dues
You still gotta pay them dues
Uh *barking* haha

Shuttin' down underground streets of New York
Hawk is what them niggas call me, cause they all be
Suckin' my dick and on my motherfuckin' balls, G
I know the half, so I laugh with 'em
A blood bath went I let the fuckin' raps hit 'em
Full clip, but only half did 'em
That's all it took, another crook
Taking out over a dirty look
I bag niggas but niggas that try and shot dead
You're only takin' a fuckin' thing from me with hot led
You know my style fagot, cause I'm always schemin'
In jail, niggas holdin' a sink screamin'
Police, but you got no peace
Yo, was that you big man, and a lot mo' grease
All I gets is that, cause niggas want none of this
Back streets are like track meets cause I'll be runnin' this

I got a ball type of ill flow that still go for days
Don't you know I could kill yo' ass in many ways
Watch you die slow like as much as you blink
Leave you in yo' crib till the neighbours know this'll stink
Use your blood like inc, write my name on the wall
Dog men X, def till the ball
Jump niggas call, beggin' for their life
And I just fucked that bitch that you call your wife
She life in strife and that's just how I want 'em
In this fuckin' me see my man get upon 'em
That's why I creep em, lay 'em, slide
Takin' mad motherfuckin' holes on the ride
Like the skin fly, like the Ferrari merkin', irkin
Blast your ass cause you're jerkin'
My dick, my rep, most bust the tec

The way that I'll be flippin' niggas can't understand
Niggas be like "Dog, I thought I was your man ?"
You shouldn't have thought and that's what you get for thinkin'
Think beacuse I'm near you I wouldn't get you niggas stinkin'
I'm the only offspring of a bad bread
Motivated by mad greed, I make the pad bleed
A bad seed from a rotten apple
Preacher talk shit get popped in the chapel
Flavour like Snapple, you can all get some
Cause it's all good in that hood that I'm from
I beat a nigga dumb, and do 'em real dirty
Me and my peeps, oh my peeps is 7.30
Out to lunch for ever, won't be back
Don't know how to act, so we attack in the back
Mutherfucker, that's how that do
That's how that do, that's how that do baby

[Hook] - repeat 2X

[Intro: DMX]
I know that my savior lives
And at the end, He will stand on this earth
My flesh may be destroyed
Yet from this body, I will see God
Yes, I will see Him for myself
And I long for that moment

[Verse 1: DMX]
Grandma, I really miss you, and it ain't been the same
I drop a tear when I hear your name
Mary Ella Holloway, why you gotta be so far away?
Used to say, "Don't worry, it's gon' be okay"
But it ain't – it's like when you left, you took the Lord with you
Why couldn't I come when He came to get you?
Damn, I really miss you… I had to say it again
I remember the time when I was like 10
Crept up in the neighbor's yard, yeah, bein' hard headed
You told me I would get it – you said it!
And boy did I get it, but after you spanked me, you hugged me
Kissed me on my forehead, told me that you love me
And I saw that it hurt you more than it hurt me
I thought, how bad could this hurt be?
I know now, that's why it's only done out of love
What I wouldn't give for one mo' hug, from grandma

[Chorus: Faith Evans & DMX]
Baby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that…)
Baby, it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin'…)
Baby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that…)
Baby, it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin'…)

[Verse 2: DMX]
What I'm about to say a couple of family members is gon' hate me
But I'ma let you know what's been goin' on lately
Now you know since you left a lot of things with your kids done changed
Yeah, Jackie's still crazy, don't know what's up with James
Ain't seen Jerry in a while, you know he walk like you
And Renée's back in jail, you know she talk like you
Riculah's(?) doing real good now, she workin'
Rhonda's still runnin' around, trickin', jerkin'
Buckeye's buggin', he done lost his mind
And Jarvis? Back out of jail, doin' fine
Kylie? He done changed, it ain't all about self
As for my father... well, that's somethin' else
But that's my dog, he hold his grandmother down
My great grandmother, makin' a lot of trips out of town
But that's a good thing, and if I could only hear you sing
Once more, oh Lord, the comfort it would bring

[Chorus: Faith Evans (DMX)]
Baby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that…)
Baby, it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin'…)
Baby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that…)
Baby, it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin'…)

[Verse 3: DMX (Faith Evans)]
You left behind a mother, eleven kids, eleven grand-kids
And since then, two of your grand-kids done had kids
I got a boy named Tacoma, Xavier's brother
That's right, Xavier's made you a great-grandmother
I thank you for the best times of my life
I thank you for when you first met her acceptin' and lovin' my wife
I thank you for those Sunday dinners, they were vital
I thank you for my life, I thank you for the Bible
I thank you for the songs that you'd sing in the mornin'
(Amazing Grace…) while I'm yawnin'
I thank you for the two beatings you gave me
'Cause I know somewhere along the line the lesson I learned from the two beatings saved me
And when you died I cried like a baby, I begged the Lord to take me
'Cause no one else could give me what you gave me
But life, like everything, comes to an end
I pray I go to Heaven to see you again – Amen

[Chorus: Faith Evans (DMX)]
Baby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that…)
Baby, it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin'…)
Baby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that…)
Baby, it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin'…)
Baby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that…)
Baby, it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin'…)
Baby, it's gon' be okay (She used to tell me that…)
Baby, it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin'…)

[Outro: Faith Evans]
Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see, yeah

[Verse 1: DMX]
You got a minute for Yo' son, Father? I need to talk
I'm so tired of tryin' to run, Father, let's take a walk
I'm so sorry for what I done, Father, it ain't my fault
But the devil's been on my back lately, he's like a hawk
You never give us more than we can handle, but it's gettin' hard
And I'm a strong individual, but I need You, God
Lot of things that I used to, I don't wanna
Run the streets like I used to, I know I'm gonna
Speak the word for You one day
Up in there like, "Hallelujah!" on Sunday
I thank You Lord for the blessings that You gave me
And for my life, with the blessings You have saved me
And for my wife, You have carried me enough times - and that's the truth
Married me to rough times, throughout my Youth
And through it all I saw that You was still with me
I was that one lost sheep and You was comin' to get me

[Hook]
Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...
Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...
Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...
Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...

[Verse 2: DMX]
I look at life a little different now, since You hugged me
And I always loved my peoples, but now they love me
Thank You for the love, Lord, we praise Ya
Jacob's descendants, from Africa to Asia
Pleadin' the blood of Christ over our life
Wrong or right, just help us make it through the night
And we'll shout Yo' name in times of need
And times of joy, and, when we bleed
And, when we are overcome with greed
You ain't gon' have to tell me twice, I'mma take heed
And because of what You've given me, I know You'll deliver me
And I won't drown no matter how deep the river be
You are the strength I, never knew I had
Kept the heart good when they told me it was bad
All praises due to Ya
That's why I had to dedicate somethin' new to Ya, thank You Father

[Hook]
Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...
Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...
Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...
Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...

[Verse 3: DMX]
Uhh... I never knew a love like, this before
Messin with the thug life I, missed it all
You opened the doors and, let me in
I'm down for the cause so, let's begin
Prayers that You give to me I give to them
Same way You live in me I live in them
Life is a blessing now
You got me smilin' from inside of my heart, when inside it was dark
And it doesn't rain anymore
Only sunshine, no pain anymore, I really love my
You washed away the tears with the fears
I'm happier than I've ever been in my life, the whole thirty years
You know that... one day I'll speak the word
You know that... when I do I will be heard
You know that... You gave me a permanent smile
And You know this, Father, because I'm Yo' child, what?

[Hook]
Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...
Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...
Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...
Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...

[Outro]
Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...
Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...
Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...
Lord, You got me like... Your love got me like...
Let's knock it out....that's all, oh we gon' do it

Or pay the tolls of the roads I done kept on, crept on (what)
Walk 'til I got tired then curled up and slept on (whoo)
My journey has earned me the right to reach

Suck my dick! How's about that? (aight)
Loose lifts is loose clips and crews hit

Feds lookin for the dog, oh that nigga outta town
This is a grown-up game, thinkin cause you got a blown-up name (what)You won't get a blown-up frame

(Chorus 2x)

Oh my God! Yah niggas done lost yo mind

To a buck shot, can't duck off shot

He thought the leash was on me, but dog the streets are hungry (uh-huh)
And I'mma feed 'em everytime I sing, do my thing
Dog gon' bang, bang, bang!
Grrrrrrrrr
(Chorus 4x)

[DJ Kay Slay]
Aiyo, this is DJ Kay Slay from around the way, and my dog DMX is putting it down with the Bloodline family and the Bloodline kennels! The Great Depression! Fourth time! X keeps it gutta and his dogs are no different! You gotta respect the line... First out the kennel, Jynx repping straight from Y.O. kennel, holding it down...

[Jynx]
Let it be known:
Bring it to me, break the fingers that you write with
Mouth that you recite with
Real life shit!
Niggas call me God on beats, cuz I light shit
Quicker than hoes
Shootin big holes, rippin your clothes
Play games and have a thug nigga sittin at your home
See you walkin with that bitch when he spit at yo dome
Damn, ya brains all over the place!
Bitch cryin and screamin, cuz ya brain's all over her face!
I got love for street thugs and killers, with deep mugs
Who bust they guns first then they start to cuss
Shook niggas hold they guns till they start to rust
Bitch niggas don't want no parts of us: we dangerous!
Tripped a few times off of angel dust
One shot turn yo brains to slush!
Yeah, niggas don't learn shit till the lights is off...
It's too late! Now your life is lost, motherfucker!

[Beat changes to "Bring Ya Whole Crew"]

[DJ Kay Slay]
DAMN! See what I'm saying?! This shit is real! Next out the kennel, barkin from Dirty Jerz is that nigga Loose!

[Loose Cannon]
Let me Loose, nigga! Get the fuck off me!
I can't believe my ears! Huh? These niggas is barely on!
In fact, they wack; they just got a hot song!
Fuckin up the game is cats like you
That make wack niggas think they can rap too!
But Loose at the door now, so come with me
I'mma make sure no more rappers like you get in!
You want it? We can go hard with the beats
Or hard to the body or hard to the teeth
Yeah, I was on Universal, they couldn't have it:
They kept me on the hush, like Whitney drug habit!
Got drafted, then made it to the front line
A year later, got traded to Bloodline
Now it's hard for cats to keep they spot
He rock too much ice, he can't keep it hot!
And when all the ice melt, they all watered down
Loose, fuck that, the streets is mines now!

[Beat changes to "D-X-L Hard White"]

[DJ Kay Slay]
FIRE! Only stray kills, yaknowhatimsayin? Next out the kennel, my nigga Big Stan from Harlem! Get at 'em, dog...

[Big Stan]
Uh-oh, who's next? That would be me, BS, ya know?
Uh, y'all niggas ain't ready, uh
I'm like a thief in the night:
I creep in your life one day when you nice
High off the Henny, catch you while you partying, right?
With the semi, put your body on ice
For a price, I'll make a bastard of your son as well as a widow of your wife!
My struggle was tight, love inside my heart has limits
Like anything outside of Bloodline, bound to get it
We bound to win it
What niggas want, we bound to give it
And anything you cats start, you know we bound to finish
Can you see the cage is open, the muzzle is off?
The nine is sick, the silencer will muffle the cough
The Line is thick, Stan stay solo on cost
My shoulder will frost on any nigga other than dog
I'm the one ya moms would hate you to cross
Of course, if you the only child, who'll be replacing the lost?
Please think before you go against the B.S
And no it's not a game, I'm one of Bloodline's best, nigga!

[Beat changes to "Make a Move"]

[DJ Kay Slay]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, they just keep biting! The last to bite, that bitch, the bitch of the litter: Crazy Kash, Kashmir, get at em girl...

[Kashmir]
What the fuck y'all niggas know about grease?!
I got enough to put in ya piece
Plus bust ten in ya fleece
Make ya back bend in a crease
That's what you get offend a beast
You hating me like I was a friend of Kelis
Load, cock back and release
Bad bitch cracking ya piece
Bullet holes in the back of your peeps
Always catch niggas coming from the back with the heat
Love to watch they knees buckle when they smack the concrete
You ain't gotta love me, just respect the bitch!
Scared to fight me, get your girls, so I can wet the bitch!
Who gives a fuck who ya old lady be?
I put holes in ya old lady tee if she fucking with me!
You know my niggas Stan, Jynx, Loose, Berg and X
Ya niggas switching occupations, 'cause they heard we next
No niggas above mine, 'cause no niggas above mine
And that shit's in my heart, 'cause it's in my fucking Bloodline...
{Mysonne} (DMX)

{Mysonne, Mysonne the problem child DMX Ruff Ryders}
(Wanna flow wanna problem)
{Problem Children, y'all niggas got problems}
(Wanna flow wanna problem)

[Chorus]
{But they don't want no problems} (Nah baby)
{But they don't want no problems} (Wanna flow wanna problem)
{But they don't want no problems nah nah they don't want no problems}
(Wanna flow wanna problem)
{But they don't want no problems}
{But they don't want no problems} (Wanna flow wanna problem)
{But they don't want no problems nah nah they don't want no problems}
(No problems I'm telling you baby)

[Mysonne]
Yo, yo I told niggas to pack they bags or grab they guns before I come
It's too late, y'all had your fun!
It's all over now! I don't wanna talk to niggas!
Popping shots like corks in niggas!
Sticking forks in niggas' cause they done!
Only reason y'all still breathing is cause y'all run!
When we bust shots, my nigga clutch Glocks
Broad daylight in front of precincts; fuck cops!
Niggas want pops? Then they die for them!
Kiss the barrel, cry for them!
Spirit leave your body, touch the sky for them
Fuck Voltron! See what me and mines form
In the .9 storm; death: time's gone!
I'm that cat that y'all niggas got your eyes on
Go to papi broke trying to get your pies on
The day that I'm gone I'm real fuck stardom
Niggas wanna talk, but they don't want no problems!

[Chorus]

[DMX]
All y'all niggas want is your heart back; dog, you pussy
Acting like you really wanna bark back; don't push me
Only room enough for one dog to hold the shit down
You cowards know it now (What!?) I'ma hold it down
When I'm done close it down; it's my shit here!
The fuck that nigga just say? Try shit here!
Come on, cupcake, y'all cats ain't even built like that
I done seen through the bullshit; I'm real like that
I know how to walk the dog, I know how to chase the cat
I know how to get a bone, I know how to bring it back
I know how to flip on a nigga, split him with the bat
I know how to train a pup to make sure they scratch
You motherfuckers don't want no problems, 'cause my revolver is solving them
One by one until it's all of them
Let that be a lesson to your mans and shit:
Keep your fucking mouth shut if your mans want spit, nigga!

[Chorus]

[Drag-On]
Well it's the kid that'll crush your head into a cake batter
Y'all know that cake mix but y'all don't wanna taste this shit
Guns I should've been arrested for
Y'all gone make my bullets expand like a lesbi jaw
Don't you test me, boy!
Don't fuck with X or Drag-to-the-Dash, 'cause once you dump in these bags
You drag to the trash dumpster, amongst the rest of them fags!
My poker got your skin looking like acupunctures
Keep a silence on the tip; can't afford the noise
My banger got a jagged edge like them four boys
If you hot, I'll Super Soak you, and you won't be able to dry it off
Just relax, take your last breath, and die it off!
Nothing but love I spread
But if you take advantage, the weight that's lead will rush your head
You sweat'll die your hair red, like my bitch Eve!
And no, I'm not a faggot, but I make niggas striptease in front of me
It's fun to me, bitches!

[Chorus]
Let us pray
Father God I am just learning how to pray... bear with me
First I thank you for the life of everyone that's here with me
Then I thank you for the love you give me, why?
I don't know; I don't deserve it, and it hurts inside
Many a nights I cried, and called your name out loud
But didn't call you when I was doin' good... too proud
And still you gave me love, I wasn't used to that
Most of the people that gave me love, they ended up takin' it back
That's somethin' new to me, so I'm askin' you for time to adjust
Let me make it there, I will be one you can trust
What I stand for, I put my life on, I do!
I guess what I'm askin' is: show me how to stand for you
And I will rap for you, sing for you, preach for you, teach for you, reach for you
I will love you like you love me: unconditionally
And I will always be prepared for whatever the mission'll be
Give the nutrition to me, and I'll properly digest it
And when I give it back, I'll show you word well invested
And whenever I go, before I go, let me give
Thanks to you Lord, for my birth, for every day that I've lived
You gave me a love most of my life I didn't know was there
In the name of Jesus! I give you my life, 'cause you cared
Amen

WHAT?! Motherfucker get the gat!
{*rapid gun blasts*}
Bitch-ass nigga. Home of the brave! {*BLAM*}

[Hook]
Ayo! Bounce to that Trina Moe
Niggas about to blow
Bouncin' straight out the door
Here we go, here we go

[Verse 1]
Bloodline, scratch all day, match all weight
Only dogs eating is us, we snatch all plates
Err, ERR! ERR! Get him, boy!
Click, click, pop the leash, hit him, boy!
Niggas brag about waggin', we stop the tails
X drop an album, niggas droppin' sales
Niggas can't fuck with the dog, forget about it
Money went up against the dog, read about it
Man, listen, you cats better walk easy
I'm on some positive shit, but I still walk greasy
Ain't nothing changed, still ain't sweet
Stand on one block, but I own the whole street
And on the whole street is dirty niggas with funny moves
Leaving your house with bloody boots, we cruddy dudes
Rest of them ass kissers is sensitive ass niggas
Fourth album, and I still get in that ass, nigga

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
It's Dark and Hell is Hot
Flesh of my Flesh, Blood of my Blood; And Then There Was X
Got niggas like, "What's next and then?"
Hit 'em again, you cats ain't never gon' win
I was here before most of y'all careers were born
I'll be here when y'all careers are gone, still strong
Difference between right and wrong is me
Niggas talk shit, but you can't MC
We already know how much your watch is worth
Talk about helping the hurt, saving the Church
Why don't you brag about helping out where you come from?
And give brothers a job that really want one?
Gotta think about that shit you said, you don't mean it
I done listened to that shit you said, but I done seen it
Most of you cats is type funny
But when it comes time to feed the hungry, gon' get type ugly

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Man, I'm already knowin', like y'all niggas is knowin'
You can't fuck with dog, bust a cap, scrap or flowin'
Seeing is believing, and well, let's just see
I ain't even gon' speak, one million the first week
Aight, let's ask the streets: How many sold?
What? Three niggas, three months to go gold?
C'mon, ese, keep it real, homes
You fuckin' with the dog, you already know
This ain't nothing new, fuck is you mad at?
15 million! Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Rest assured, I'm best abroad
You can test Billboard because the rest are frauds
I got 18 years under my belt, rappin'
Let me see, you was three, I was making it happen
Next time we bump heads, don't be hard headed
Show some motherfuckin' respect, bitch, or you'll all get it

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I'm always talking shit, cause wherever I go I walk in shit
And now they got me on some stalking shit
Broad daylight, niggas is crabs, but I don't want anyone to blab
So from the roof I pick em off like a scab
And watch the slug bust a mug like a watermelon
He shoulda thought about that before he got caught up telling
And now another kid grows up without a daddy or a mommy
Cause at the funeral I hit up the caddy with an the army
Of real niggas, with nothing to lose
Cause when it's time to go you don't get to choose
I make the muthafuckin rules and I enforce em
Shorty's people was loose ends so he lost them
I took the joints and tossed them, in the river
At the same spot that I dumped this kid that didn't wanna give a nigga the combo, to the safe in the crib
Look, money, that's why I did what I did

{2 niggas Talking.....}

[Verse 2]
Mad stressed and I'm about to have a breakdown
It's time for pops who got the store on the corner to get a shakedown
He hasn't paid for protection in like two months
So I figured I'd leave him with like two fronts
I break up shit to let him know that I'm real
Reminder, I know where you live so don't squeal
Told him, next time I come, have some paper for me
Don't fuck around and turn into another caper for me
Cause though he's cool all that cool shit stops
And I be in the crowd talking bout, "Yo who killed pops?"
It's a shame, he was caught up in the game and couldn't play it
Before I smoked him, I asked him "who's the man" and made him say it
Three times, and that's how many times I hit him
A nigga was acting like he didn't have to pay so I did him
Yo I think this shit is going to my head (for real)
But let that be a lesson, don't pay dues and you dead
{2 niggas Talking.....}

[Verse 3]
A little birdie told me that the feds were on to me
And they wanted to do something real wrong to me
So I broke out, played the L for a while
Checked my sources and found my name was on file
Under gun for hire and extortion
But yo I never use the same joint twice as a precaution
And I heard this kid tried to set me up
He knew I knew so he tried to wet me up
See he was under investigation for drugs
They set up all types of phone taps and bugs
Then when they bagged him, money went out, like a bitch (he was my friend)
Said they'd let him go, all he had to do was snitch
And I know now he wish they would have kept him
Cause it was sweet how I crept him, wet him up then left him
And that's for muh'fuckas that don't know
Go against the grain and you feel the pain
Aight yo?

*BEEP* Thursday, June 28th, 2:02 AM
"I just called you and you said Domino's Pizza, but… and you said you were on your way, but there's just one problem
I'm all the way to fucking Rochester, New York. Wrong ho!"

[Talking: DMX]
Uhh, yo yo… yo, not this shit again
Dog gon' be a dog, y'knahmean? Motherfucking dog!
Don't get a dog if you can't take care of a dog
Gotta take care of the dog, y'know? Y'know?
Take it easy lady, y'know? Uh-huh
Give me a motherfucking break, will ya?

[Verse 1: DMX]
Shorty was the bomb, brownskin honey with a little dough
Come to find out she was a lil hoe, but still, yo
I pushed up, shorty had that ass like blaow
Had me scheming on how I could get that now
Was like girlfriend, let me drop a bug in yo' ear
She was mine cause I told her what she wanted to hear
Was like yeah, she knew how it was going down
She said page me, code zero, cause I know you get around
Didn't have a man, but even if she did dead
Cause my game is tight like a stocking cap on a nigga's head
I said, we'll get up like nine or somethin'
Don't act like when I say that ass is mine I'm frontin'
That night was right, she let me get that, hit that
Rip that, bounce it off the walls, flip that
But only, one thing went wrong, the rubber bust
But I didn't fuss cause, dog, shorty was the bomb

[Hook: DMX *singing*]
Shorty, UH! We only did it for that night
But man, the pussy was good
But shorty's fucking up my life, fucking up my life
Shorty, UH! We only did it for that night
But man, the pussy was good
But shorty's fucking up my life
C'mon, ma, give me a break!

[Verse 2: DMX]
A few days later, I hit her up just to keep it real
Was like, "Whassup, boo? How you been? How you feel?"
She said, "Aight, but my friend's kinda late
Today's the 13th, and it should've been here on the 8th"
I'm like, "For real?! Don't stress it, it'll come
It better cause I can't afford another little one"
She said, "Neither can I", I said, "Cool
Cause I got mad shit to do and you still going to school"
So at least we had the same thing in mind
Not to have this kid and everything would be fine
But I was blind to the fact that she was setting me up
For the kill, damn, why wasn't she on the pill?
And I still would check on her like once a week
Sometimes I hit it, sometimes I didn't, but shorty was a freak
And whenever I would speak on the baby
Shorty would be like, "I ain't having this kid, is you crazy?"

[Hook]

[Verse 3: DMX]
By now, wasn't looking too good
Cause she wasn't doing things that she told me she would
Like getting the price checked out for what we had to do
And it goes up another yard for every month after two
And a half, I had to laugh out of frustration
Now she's four months, I'm ready to hit the bus station
If I was still on that shit it would've made me rob her
Told her friends, "DMX? Yeah, that's my baby's father"
Her lil' stomach is shown, so now the heat is on
Maybe she'll see the light if I start to treat her wrong
Like if she thought that if she kept the baby she would keep me, so I played the game on her level, got sneaky
Let her have the kid, she said it was premature
Found out she was six months when she said she was four
So I left her with the pressure on the next man's arm
But she'll be aight, cause shorty was the bomb

[Hook]

[Mic Geronimo]
YEAH! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
C'mon, c'mon hah hah, M.G
Know the G, hah hah, know the face
Hah hah, know the name nigga, hah
C'mon, yeah, yeah

Now who could do it like the M-I-C, y'all niggas ain't about this life
Runnin up inside of the crib to cut your lights
My A.R. likes the thug life, drugs and gun fights
White on whites, menage and dykes, and nice ice
White wraps for these niggas who scrap and gun clap
Stick up kids, leavin y'all with two in the back
Once you bitch-made niggas started doin the rap
Seven figure shit really started ruinin rap
Take it back to hood shit bulletproof and biscuits
Chips all for hustle and grams go from bricks
And whips for templates, we switch while we movin all of this weight
'til we screamin all of us hate

[Hook: Mic Geronimo]
You see shit's still real
Nothin ever change cause we still in the field
Niggas try to front but the game's too real
We don't give a fuck bout the way you feel
So fuck what you feel and shit's still real
Nothin ever change cause we still in the field
Niggas try to front but the game's too real
We don't give a fuck bout the way you feel
So fuck what you feel, yeah

[Big Stan]
Y'all niggas better get the guns
Fuck the pep talk, I don't wanna hear it
When it's on it's on, talkin I don't feel it
That's the fake shit, argue and just make shit hot
And with my short fuse I'm always quick to make shit pop
Nigga respect this, catch me on the block and with gloves
I'm ambidextrous, sold with the Glock and the snub
But I ain't reckless, with me it's always one big dot
Then one big shot, and one kid drops
Head shot, closed lid over one big box
And a preacher left prayin over one big plot
Never a mess, now I wanna conquer the world
And I'mma do it, wanna know how? Fuckin with Earl
He's the one that took me in to raise the dog from a pup
With his guidance, help create a beast from a mutt
Just released from the cut goin straight for the neck
B.S., Bloodline, what the fuck you expect nigga?

[Hook]

[DMX - overlapping Hook]
Uhh, WHAT?! Uhh
Uhh, uhh, uhh

[DMX]
It's time to take out the garbage, y'all niggas want the hard shit
I got shit that'll start shit, rip apart shit and disregard shit
Thought it wasn't real no more, just because I got a deal
What you think, I ain't gon' steal no more?
"Usual Suspects" once again - thus begins
The bullshit we both went through form trusted friends
Bustin him from where? (It's time to peel)
Fuck what you heard baby! Shit's still real
Y'all niggas think your shit don't stink, cause it don't think
Hit a motherfuckin iceberg your ship won't sink
Bitch don't blink, cause I'mma hit you with somethin
I'mma hit you for frontin, I'mma hit you for nuttin? You buggin
I'm lovin it - the obstacles that I go through
It keeps me real, don't make me have to show you
Fuck you cause I don't know you, and listen dog
If I gots to blow you, you know where you goin to

[Hook] - repeat 2X

[Intro: DMX]
Uh, yeah, another one of those (This is for my nigga Q)
Down to earth joints (Rest in peace, baby, you know how we roll)
There's so many that don't know (You knew I could do it)
(They don't know who we be)
This goes out to my nigga Q, rest in peace, baby (I miss you, dog)
They don't know who we be (You still here with me?)

[Verse 1: DMX]
What they don't know is
The bullshit, the drama (Uh), the guns, the armor (Uh)
The city, the farmer, the babies, the mama (What?)
The projects, the drugs (Uh), the children, the thugs (Uh)
The tears, the hugs, the love, the slugs (Come on)

The problems, the things we use to solve 'em (What?)
Yonkers, the Bronx (Uh), Brooklyn, Harlem (Come on)
The hurt, the pain, the dirt, the rain (Uh)
The jerk, the fame, the work, the game (Uh)
The friends, the foes, the Benz, the hoes (What?)
The studios, the shows, comes and it goes (Come on)
The jealousy, the envy, the phony, the friendly (Uh-huh)
The one that gave 'em the slugs the one that put 'em in me (Woo)
The snakes, the grass too long to see (Uh, uh)
The lawnmower sittin' right next to the tree (Come on)

[Chorus]
They don't know who we be
They don't know who we be
They don't know who we be
They don't know who we be

[Verse 2: DMX]
What we seeing is
The streets, the cops, the system, harassment (Uh-huh)
The options, get shot, go to jail, or getcha ass kicked (Aight)
The lawyers, the part they are of the puzzle (Uh-huh)
The release, the warning, "Try not to get in trouble" (Damn)
The snitches, the odds (Uh), probation, parole (What?)
The new charge, the bail, the warrant, the hole (Damn)
The cell, the bus, the ride up North (Uh-huh)
The greens, the boots, the yard, these hearts (Uh)
The fightin', the stabbin', the pullin', the grabbin' (What?)
The riot squad with the captain, nobody knows what happened (What?)
The two years in a box, revenge, the plots (Uh)
The twenty-three hours that's locked, the one hour that's not (Uh)
The silence, the dark, the mind, so fragile (Aight)
The wish that the streets would have took you when they had you (Damn)
The days, the months, the years, despair
One night on my knees, here it comes, the prayer

[Chorus]
They don't know who we be
They don't know who we be
They don't know who we be
They don't know who we be

[Verse 3: DMX]
This here is all about
My wife, my kids (Uh-huh), the life that I live (Uh-huh)
Through the night, I was his (Uh-huh)
It was right, but I did (Uh-huh)
My ups and downs (Uh), my slips, my falls (Uh)
My trials and tribulations (Uh), my heart, my balls (Uh)
My mother, my father, I love 'em, I hate 'em (Uh)
Wish God, I didn't have 'em, but I'm glad that he made 'em (Uh)
The roaches, the rats, the strays, the cats (What, what?)
The guns, knives and bats, every time we scrap (Come on)
The hustlin', the dealin', the robbin', the stealin' (Uh)
The shit hit the ceiling', little boy with no feelings (Damn)
The frustration, rage, trapped inside a cage
Got beatin's 'til the age I carried a twelve gauge (Aight)
Somebody stop me (Please), somebody come and get me (What?)
Little did I know that the Lord was ridin' with me
The dark, the light (Uh), my heart (Uh), the fight (Uh)
The wrong (Uh), the right (Uh), it's gone (Uh), aight?

[Chorus]
They don't know who we be
They don't know who we be
They don't know who we be
They don't know who we be (Come on)
They don't know who we be
They don't know who we be

[Outro: DMX over Chorus]
Man, listen (They don't know who we be)
These motherfuckers don't know who we are
They don't know (They don't know who we be)
They couldn't possibly fuckin' know, dawg
That's from the heart
Dawg, this shit is crazy

[Hook 2x]
You could be blind
But you gon' see it when you need to see it
You gon' be fine
Cause you gon' be here when you need to be here
One of a kind
First free your mind, and then you'll free your spirit
Go where I go, dog in my life

[Verse 1]
Now if you start with dirt, then you start with hurt
You start with "Oh, you ain't got?"
Well here, take my shirt
Start with work, blood and tears over the years
Goin' through whatever we go through, we stickin' it out here
Pups turn into dogs, tadpoles into frogs
I'm just eatin' what's in front of me, ain't thinking about yours
But I'mma keep my paws on what's mine
Beg 'til I find
Strapped 'til I'm blind
A nigga that whatever I do, still gon' be able to spit this
I'm wit' this, cause this is mine, you scared shitless
Rap niggas can't fuck with the dog
Never, could be twenty below outside
I'm built for the weather
It could be hotter than lava, I wouldn't bother to sweat
To some of you niggas, I'm a father, but you startin' to forget
I paid my dues, not only did you not wear
But you would really love it
If you could meet that cat that made my shoes
C'mon!

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 2]
Now see, what I do is peep shit, keep shit low
Keep paying attention to what you trying to show me
Livin', but you never know, we livin'
Don't give me what you don't owe me
Don't tell me that you love me
Don't talk shit, don't kill me slowly
Cause a dog like me, is an only
Meaning, hit another like you, truth hurts, but I can't be phony
You always looking for bad, look at you mad
But you won't be satisfied 'til it took what you had
(Aight) I'm a thoro nigga, I keep my word
And anybody that's ever met me, got love for me
So I keep a heard
And that shit y'all niggas told me got me fucked up in the head
Went from, "Yo, that's my dog"
To, "Yeah, that nigga dead"
What the fuck is all this?
News to me
Dog it's like shit ain't what it used to be
See some niggas choose to be on the other side of the fence
Keep riding with this, get fried in the mix
C'mon!

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 3]
Now if it ain't that, then don't say that
Cause I don't play that, y'all play that
But the poke ain't black, damn, why you say that?
I thought that...what?
Nevermind, I just thought it
We supposed to keep it real
I destroy what I was taught
Misery, love, company
Now you niggas talikin' 'bout jumpin' me, pumpin' me
Full of slugs, blood, stud with the love
Damn, I just gave, what a real, nigga does
Don't listen to the buzz, don't get caught up in the hype
You'll lose everything that you worked for
Trying to take a nigga's stripes
Live life through life, and so on and so on
That's when the grow on, man, get your flow on
You niggas gettin' too old for this kid shit
On the real, we all done did shit to get shit
Snake shit, right is right, wrong is wrong
Muh'fucker, listen to this song
You see what shit I'm on
C'mon!

[Hook 4x]

[Spoken Word: DMX]
Sometimes I wonder what life's about
Sometimes I wonder why the lights are out
Sometimes I wonder why I like to shout
Sometimes I wonder what the lies are 'bout
Sometimes I see things I shouldn't have seen
Sometimes I wonder why I'm a hood and a fiend
Sometimes I look at what I've become and cry
Sometimes I get on that bullshit and be ready to die
Sometimes a nigga that's your man might get it
Sometimes even though it's sweet, if you ain't with it
Sometimes the pain is too much to bear
Sometimes it rains too much to care
Sometimes if you don't watch your back it'll cost you
Sometimes you wonder who would give a fuck if they lost you
Yet sometimes the sun shines around the clock
But sometimes it's dark, and Hell is hot

[Intro: DMX]
Grrrrrr!
See, this is what the fuck we do

Dog is the nigga that's gon' walk through the night
Park the car twenty blocks away and walk to the fight (WHAT?!)
And go where the fuck I want cause New York is alright
The dog is alright, if the hawk is on sight
Everything from "Get at Me Dog" to "What's My Name?" (woo!)
X got a rep, niggas trust my name
Ain't never been a nigga to discuss my fame (WHAT?!)
Fuck my fame, nigga, what's my name? (WHAT?!)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: DMX]

Stay pullin the thing out but what you gon' do without it?
No, I wanna know f'real, what you gon' do without it? (f'real!)
We done tested y'all niggas, the rest of y'all niggas
Threatened y'all niggas, STRAIGHT UP, double vested y'all niggas
And it was ONLY out of love that we protect y'all niggas
And because of a nigga in jail, we respected y'all niggas
But

[Hook] - 1/2

[DMX]
Be careful where you walkin cause the ground's real shaky
Nigga hold the fo' but PLEASE don't make me

[DMX]
Y'all lookin' for names, I'm lookin' for beats
Y'all lookin' for fame, I live in the streets
Y'all talk the talk, but I walk the walk
School street, home of the brave, NEW YORK
Y'all make movies, but I make moves
Straight up, y'all got somethin' to prove
Y'all niggas duck, but I swing back
Y'all niggas run, but I bring gats
Y'all niggas whisper, "X is a crackhead"
Aight fuck it, I'ma just crack heads
I bang niggas that cross the line
Y'all niggas talk shit from way behind
I stand my ground, but y'all niggas don't
Shit I go to jail, but y'all niggas won't
Y'all niggas walk around and get scared
But I don't give a fuck, I don't care

[Hook: DMX]
I ain't a dancing nigga, I just move to the beat
Sit there and nod my head but won't move my feet
Gangsta, so I'm holdin' up the walk
That dancing shit up to the rest of y'all

Y'all niggas is pussy, straight up ass
I keep that thing, and I'll blast
Letcha man know, he don't wanna push me
Remember, it's you not me that's pussy
Y'all niggas walk light on your toes
I come through hard, kickin' down doors
I spit a mean 16 without a pause
Then let 16 go just because
You in it for the dough, I'm in it for life
You in jail beatin' your dick, I'm fuckin' your wife
I bring the drama, I bring the noise
Kidnap yo mama, bring her to the boys
I make shit happen with one word
You take shit laughin' nigga, you's a bird
I take niggas for everything they got
That's why I'm the dog and you not

"Rapper and actor DMX, along with wife pregnant wife Tashera, showed up at the federal court in Queens Wednesday to accept a plea agreement
Inside the courthouse, DMX signed autographs with a sketch artist over the face, as well as the fans caught off guard by this star's appearances..."

[Hook: DMX]
My baby motha be buggin' soon as I walked in the door
Got me like, "I ain't fuckin with that bitch no more!"
Don't even like, so I can't fuck with her
Thinkin' cause we got a kid together, I'm stuck with her
My baby motha be buggin' soon as I walked in the door
Got me like, "I ain't fuckin with that bitch no more!"
Don't even like, so I can't fuck with her
Thinkin' cause we got a kid together, I'm stuck with her (Nah!)

[Verse 1: DMX]
My baby's motha be buggin, she wanna blast stick bitches
One of them talk shit, and then get they ass kicked bitches
Once upon a story, y'all niggas know the story
And that everything is lovely when it's all about the glory
But soon as shit hit the fan, honies be wanna take the kid and scram
I'm having bad thoughts, don't like how dark it's getting man
From the time I wake up and get dressed
I get stressed, and hardly ever get rest
It's '05, so I'm on some different shit cousin
She ain't gon have me listening to that riffin shit cousin
I got moves to make and mad shit to do
Her friends are looking good so I might hit the crew
It's like one and two that might get a nigga that big and happy
And I know them bitches will fuck me cause when I see 'em, they be winkin at me
You listenin thinkin that's a crazy brother
But I'm gon have to be a father who ain't fuckin with his baby motha

[Hook: DMX]
My baby motha be buggin' soon as I walked in the door
Got me like, "I ain't fuckin with that bitch no more!"
Don't even like, so I can't fuck with her

[Verse 2: DMX]
Bitches be callin the cops, thinkin they callin the shots
Takin the dude with the bag, baby it's all in the pops
And do yo thing, cause I'm doin mine boo
A nigga just been chillin, I been just fine, and you?
I kicked it with my honey and she put me on to something
You gon think until you really see me gon, I'm frontin
Maybe if you kept your friends of respectable distance
Out of our business, I wouldn't have to come and visit
I thought you knew, that the shit you do like switchin clothes
With a bitches crew ain't too kosher when they hoes
But that ain't never stopped yo ass from passin on the Guess
Askin' for that Coogie sweater, patten up the breast
Patten up the butt, but you think niggas is stupid
Last week yo shit was like the dog, look at it now, too big
I ain't gon blow yo shit no more, I shouldn't be even did that
'Cause you my baby motha, and I'ma always hit that

[Bridge: Janyce & DMX]
Give a hell what you say (You don't)
I ain't never gon go away (You won't)
I'mma stalk you till I find you (Been there)
Turn around and be right behind you (Still there)
Be in the bushes outside yo house
Just waitin for you to come out
'Cause I'm a stupid bitch (I know)
A real fuckin stupid bitch (I know)
Ain't nothing but a stupid bitch (C'mon!)

[Verse 3: DMX]
My baby motha be buggin soon as I walked in the door
Got me like "I ain't fuckin with this bitch no more"
Give me a Puerto Rican honey that cook rice and beans
And hair down to her ass, who looks nice in them jeans
So I can be like "Damn, you looking good and I wanna fuck"
But you a chicken so when I'm finish, I got a duck
Plus, you don't wanna be around and see what honey do
And plenty comin through, she comin through with that twenty-two
Trust me, you don't need that in your life
Oh yall bitches already know, I got a wife
You'se a stupid bitch, a real fuckin stupid bitch
You ain't nothing but a stupid bitch. Bitch!

[Bridge: Janyce & DMX]

Blown away (will be blown away)
Like the wind (yes)
Like the wind blow

[DMX]
Yea, uh
From 80 school street to way across town
Cats knew how I got down cause word got around
I was that robbery kid with no gun and no mask
Catch a nigga out the door slippin' that's yo ass
Didn't laugh much cause I didn't have much
Life was like a stick half gas half clutch
Meaning half good and half bad
It was good if I caught a good vic if I didn't I was bad
Took it out on my regulars
I'd come through and if niggas was broke I took watches and cellulars
Went to jail a few times but that didn't stop me
All it taught me was how not to be sloppy
An older cat robbed me when I was like 10
If anybody wanted to help they should've did it then
But they didn't and all it did was release the beast
So I'm a feast on whatever I come across in the streets

[Hook- Janyce] (DMX)
Like the wind (like the wind)
God will take (god will take)
All my sins (all of my sins)
Blown away (will be blown away)
Like the wind (like the wind)
Like the wind (like the wind)
Blooooooooooooooown

[DMX]
I had a "S" on my chest fuck the vest
Did robberies with some cats and robbed the rest
Other times I came thought with just me and my dog
And clear out the whole fuck block cause we when hard
I bag some niggas I knew and some niggas I didn't
I ain't a fuck either way it was no bullshiting
I'm a cruddy niggas out to get money
And a couple of slugs is the only thing anybody took from me
Run up on a cat smooth like put it in his left ear
Give up the money the jewelry or get left here
Keep thinking it's a game we'll play let's get popped
See how much fun you having when your heart beat stop
Shut 'em down open up shop oh-oh no-oh blow off a nigga top
Somebody call the cops but it's to late
Cause I'm a hit you in the face
And what will kill you will be something that you ate

[Hook- Janyce] (DMX)
Like the wind (like the wind)
God will take (god will take)

Blown away (will be blown away)

Blooooooooooooooown

[Jinx]
If pain is love, why hide my pain with drugs?
Choke off haze and sell attics coke for days
Same clothes, no soap or shave
And I still got a gun on my hip for your open grave
We used to get robbery vics
Until my man got killed for his whip on some robbery shit
Then I switched to the weed and start selling crack
But I will pull a steel and put a shell up in ya back
I feel like all my life I was held up in a trap
Like if I go to heaven maybe hell will want me back
But all I really want is (unknown)
And a model bitch sitting with a head up in my lap
But since no dough don't spin
(unkown)
It's obvious I live in a house of sin
I wish I could open up the door and let 'em blow at the wind

[Janyce]
Like the wind
God will take
All my sins
Blown away
Like the wind
Like the wind
Blooooooooooooooown

Ayo dog, where you been? (Lookin up right there)
When you gon hit us again? (It's already there)
Ayo the game really needs you (So I go harder)
And when they say "yo fuck that nigga", then I'm start a...
War, it just might turn out to be (WHAT)
Six months, motherfuckin record spree
Cats disrespected what it means to rap
Went away, made a few moves and came right back to trap
That's how you do bitch niggas
Straight out the hood, right up to rich niggas
None of y'all cats is out of touch
I could reach all of y'all and it don't take much
Every party we do, we gon bring at least ten
Robbery dudes, all make robbery moves
To these dudes, the robbery is food
Nigga don't want to wait, come on dog, pass the plate
How the fuck you gon talk about crew, hold up
Whatever I rep, the whole fuckin world throw up
Slow up or get put down, shut down
I puttin my foot down, it is what it is, baby, what now
Whooo, all you cats is builts for nothin but frontin
Stop the bluffin, for real, you now want nothin
Niggas don't want no parts of Free
And you don't want a motherfuckin thing from me
H-E-L-P F-A-S-T
E-N-D up in the emergency
The urgency to break niggas down with
Cause you know, out the gates, I'm not to be fucked around with, nigga

Party (We gon party)
What we gon do is (Rock all my crew)

What we gon do is
We all came to get down
Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun

[Freeway]
I been out on the block, soon as it drops
So I'm gon spit harder, and if you yell... I'ma start some
Shit from the rip, I'ma bring out the pump
Make them blow up and crunch when I air out the clique
They dont want it with the Roc-A-Fella pitbull
Sick, so I carry and I will bury your clique bitch
It's the frontline of X
I'm two-steppin, got my weapon and the extra nine
And you get wet if you over step the line
And oh yeah, call the doctor while I find the vet
You little niggas better eat your vegetables
Get your weight up, be back out to bless y'all
Me and Dark Man got it mapped out
My nick name Hawk Man, don't get your face cut
Countin scars and gon get your place rushed
From me and my nation, with my gun glow in the dark man
You hear and see and hear what its sparks man
Free is here, my strong man, give up your safe, buck
Yup, so fuck what you heard
He can't see me in the battle cause I battle with the burner
And I know you wanna battle, cock back the burner
And I let a nigga have it with the rat-tat-tat
And if I'm askin to battle and
He try to battle Free and he gave em what he wanted
With a shot to the stomach, if his crew got a problem
We can shoot it out, midnight to the morning hour

[DMX] (Freeway)
What we gon do is (What we gon do is)
Party (We gon party)
What we gon do is (Rock with my crew)
We cam to party

X comes thru the hood, like here comes trouble
Year of the dog again, first week double
Low in the rider, east coast nigga
Fo' in the rider, street loc nigga
Far from jiggy, but like Biggie, bitches call me Big Poppa
I got a big dick and I'd a pop her
Yea the kid talk shit but the kid don't front
How ever shit go "Give 'Em What They Want"
I ain't signing shit, love my fans
But Cross this line with the camera in your hands
Cause it could get real ugly real thick
And you like this nigga will plug me real quick
Motherfuckin' right, I ain't got time for the small talk
One of us has got to go down, we can't all walk
You know this as well as I do
But I promise you, I'm go hide you and no one will find you

[Hook] (Swizz Beatz)

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Stop nigga, hold up, you know I don't quit
You see I'm back and I'm comin' to smash your shit
And ahhla back with the god and bus-a-bus nigga
This time I'm Bringin' the shovel so I can come and dig another grave
For all of you bustards what the fuck you think you doin'
I'll put a stop to your function and anybody movin'
And then I'll fuck up production and any crew you flew in
You ain't with me, you against me, The loser side you chosen
Anyway, word to ears, you niggas know I ain't finished
I'll Fuck up every hood, and I'm back to handle my business
You niggas thinking you though like you ate a can of spinach
In till we mash on you faggots and make you change up your image
Flip mode in this bitch, Ruff Ryders is with me
You see we back on the block and yes, we runnin' the city
Now you niggas know the flow less ain't controlin' the committee
Nothing' should be movin' unless my crew in it, you fell me

[Hook] (Swizz Beatz)

[Verse 3: DMX]
If there is money involved, I want half
Niggas is funny to watch, go head laugh
Ain't nothing to smile about
For real dog, all niggas is wildin' out
Niggas who pound you out
We found you out in distance
Leg missin', head missin'
Something like 28 days missin'
And you know how the dessert do a nigga
Brake you down quick, residue a nigga
Can't stop the flow, Niggas stop and go
But whenever I drop, a million out the door
Y'all niggas know, X is not to be fucked with
Y'all run around on some dumb shit with a slump dick
Fucking bitch, you niggas know I don't mind scrapping
When I see you I see you what ever happens, happens
This ain't just rappin', niggas talk a good one
You know what let that go, see me in the hood son

Uh (Owww) uh oh
It's for the ladies (Ha ha)
Strickly for the ladies (One more time)
Hey, that's all this is
Uh uh (Uh uh)

[DMX]
She was five seven one twenty-five
Man, loose lips with those thighs (Uh)
Couldn't just let her walk by (right), I ain't a thirsty nigga
But right about now my throat was gettin real dry
Shoo this shit, had to be the cutest bitch
I seen in a long time and I don't do this shit, like
Runnin up on hoes, what up ma, I'm X
Cause you know how this goes, come on ma, I'm X
We just chill, sat and talk to the first light
And for the first time I didn't fuck on the first night
And it was aight, shorty was a thorobred
Like "Belly", we ain't fuck, she just gave me head, for real

[Hook]
(Janice)
From the time that the sun is up
Till the stars show up
It really doesn't matter to me
It doesn't matter babe
There's no love like the dog love
There's no love, it's dog love

(Amerie)
No matter what, I'll hold you down
Nobody else will come around
Don't even matter cause
There's no love like the dog love
I got my dog love, got my dog love baby
(There's no love, it's dog love)

[DMX]
I run with shorty, pass off the gun to shorty
Do whatever gots to be done with shorty, straight like that
When I hit her like "I'll be right back"
Yo, I'll be right back, ain't no bullshittin, I'll be right back
She got a nigga catchin feelings, I'm a street nigga hard body
But, she got me catchin feelings
Man, those eyes, those lips
Be like damn, those thighs, those hips
She like "blam", make a nigga have to touch somethin (For real)
Not necessarily fuck somethin, as long as I touch somethin (For real)
A nigga blood boil when I see another nigga holla (WHAT)
Don't make me have to pop a nigga in his fuckin collar

[Hook]

[DMX]
Aiyyo, shit is goin to smooth (Uh)
Since Stella got a new groove (Yeah) it's like we got somethin to prove
We gon' make it, rain or shine
My heart is yours and yours is mine
Like Eve said, "Love Is Blind" (Come on), right about now
I can't see shit cause you always on my mind
Been like that, since I met her, had to have her so I went to get her
But I'm a dog so I didn't sweat her
And it wasn't bout the cheddar, I don't trick
I got two things for bitches, couple of jokes and some dick
Yeah the kid talk slick but that's not what I'm about
We got dog love and me and shorty ridin it out, we out

[Hook]

[Janice and Amerie]
All I want is you in my life
All I got is you in my life
All I need is you in my life
So I know I'm gonna be all right
(Repeat)

[DMX]
Ask me if I cry
I'll tell you why I can
Come on!

[Hook x2]
I'm gonna go hard
Whether I'm right or wrong
Till the dead and gone
It's on!
What ya'll really want?!
Bring it on
I'mma let life be my song

[DMX]
How I live is simple
Walk through the streets
Talk to the beats
New York! I'mma eat
I never had a problem with surviving
No problem with getting down, busting my guns, or ruff rydin'
Cats talk slick but I talk slicker
My shits for real cause I'm that nigga
The reason that you hurtin' is you gotta take your problems
Straight to the lord, no body else can solve them(?)
See what I see but look through my eyes
The devil is a liar the truth never lies
We all got issues
Shit that we go thru
Shit that we been thru
Shit that we won't do
The pain that we bring upon ourself
For no reason, is the worst!
That's why I say I'm blessed with the curse
The Lord gave it all to me
And in the process, I lost my soul
Damn! the devil got a hold
In my mind, I'm like a little boy
Lost in crime
Like the healthy nigga that the devil forced into dying
The lord knows I'm trying
But at the same time
You hear the nigga with the weight of the world!
Why you gave it to Earl?

[Hook x2]
I'm gonna go hard
Whether I'm right or wrong
Till the dead and gone
It's on!
What ya'll really want?!
Bring it on
I'mma let life be my song

To live is to suffer
And I'm living it up
Face everyday chin up
I ain't giving it up
Cause if I ain't giving a fuck
The who will?!
So I hope for the best
Knowing that its all uphill
Sometimes I wonder what's lifes about
Sometimes I wonder why I take the wrong route
Then turn around and go out
And no doubt, the fate in mine is blind
So whatever, fuck it, I'mma roll out
We all go through the motions
We get different notions
We each have our own ocean
That we can either drown or float
Like the vessels that we are
Vessels that would carry many far
Dont know what to say, when you talking
Dont know who you gone see, when you walking
If you dont know how much of what you do is dirt
3 things you dont know gonna get you hurt!
Nigga!

[Hook x4]
I'm gonna go hard
Whether I'm right or wrong
Till the dead and gone
It's on!
What ya'll really want?!
Bring it on
I'mma let life be my song

[Intro]
Let us pray for those that we've lost
We know that we miss them for selfish reasons
Oh Lord my God, indeed you I put my trust
Save me, from all them that persecute me
And deliver me, in Jesus name, GRRRRR

[Hook]
Cause we all go anyway, I'ma say goodbye today
Cause it could be any day, I'ma say goodbye today
We've grown in so many ways, but I'ma say goodbye today
Cause it could be any day, I'ma say goodbye today-ayayyyy

[Verse 1]
I'ma say goodbye today, cause I don't know when
We gon' cross paths again, until then
I'ma be that, MC that, speaks the truth
Believe that, I'ma see that, to reach the youth
My suffering will not be in vain (NOT)
Neither will yo' pain ever since you passed to hear yo' name
Rest in peace to Autumn - we all know cancer cells kill
But if they caught 'em, they could've fought 'em
If you'd still be here, right here with us
We'd have plenty time before death came to get us
BUT, what is death like?  Should I really care?
After looking at it, was life really fair?
Did you burn any bridges?  Did you make amends?
Did you ask God for forgiveness for your sins?
What is Heaven like?  If you could come back, should you?
If you could communicate for a moment there, would you?
... Just questions that we ask ourselves, every day (wanna know)

[Hook]
Cause we all go anyway, I'ma say goodbye today
Cause it could be any day, I'ma say goodbye today
We've grown in so many ways, but I'ma say goodbye today
Cause it could be any day, I'ma say goodbye today-ayayyyy

[Verse 2]
So young, so gifted
Direction of life was uplifted, when the wind shifted
And took a turn for the worse, with the blessing come the curse
A nigga stressing took the dog into the hearse
My nigga Divine was way too young to die
Fell out the nest and was way too young to fly
But that didn't stop fate from happening
Idle time make the Devil—HATE WHAT'S HAPPENING!
God no!  Why did it go that way?
Coming from his fans away, why did he go that day?
Lightly, I dare say, life goes on
Donuts, Trey and Jerz I say, please be strong
He was supposed to be on the road with me
I wish somebody WOULD'VE came to get me
And niggas would've had to hit ME
But until then, MY FRIEND
I'ma say goodbye today, cause you never know when

[Hook]
Cause we all go anyway, I'ma say goodbye today
Cause it could be any day, I'ma say goodbye today
We've grown in so many ways, but I'ma say goodbye today
Cause it could be any day, I'ma say goodbye today-ayayyyy

[Outro]
Goodbye today, I'ma say goodbye today
Goin away hey (uhh) goodbye today, I'ma say goodbye today
(It's okay) And I say (let us pray)
Goodbye today (and I say) say goodbye today
Go on your way (and I say when you're, gone) I'ma say goodbye today
I'ma say goodbye today (gotta say before you move on) HEY!
Yes (yeah!)
I mean, this is life (yeah, say goodbye)
We are born, to die, so LET ME FLY! (know what I mean)
Let me fly, we are born, to die (be good)
{"Sometimes the pain is too much to bear" - repeat to end of Outro}
Cause I'm in a better place ('til we meet again)
I'm in a better place (I don't know what form)
See you soon baby! (we'll meet again)
Ha ha! .. (But we will meet again)
...
Spread your wings (they gon' shed a tear on this one!)
Fly, I'll try not to cry, it'll be hard
I just, miss, not having you here
Even though I know you're in a better place!
I just miss not having you here
Kinda selfish when you think about it
That's nature, that's life
Spirit, never dies, as lessons begin

[DMX]
Man are you for real?
You niggas can't be fucking serious
You not for real. you gotta be playing
You better walk away

I run shit here, Y'all just sit here
Do y'all niggas know what it took for me to get here
I'm gonna stay here, earn my way here
You can fuck around if you want but we don't play here
We get through that, run right through that
That's how we do that, y'all niggas knew that
Two albums in one year three albums in two
Didn't I just fucking tell y'all niggas that's how we do
You wasn't even fucking listening when I just said
What I said, you get that, what I just said
I run shit here fuck y'all niggas
Jail what I said I used to duck y'all niggas
Motherfucker I'm grown and that's all to it
Y'all leave a child on his own and I'm gonna do it
Fuck I done did it, shit it
You ain't even half way close to being with it forget it

Fame niggas make stretcha catch up with you quicka
You that nigga oh for real you that nigga
Let me show you how we do that nigga
See, y'all cats are small cats
And niggas like us aren't gonna believe that
We takin all that fall back
Get down, lay down, sit down
Stay down, head round. Hey now
Does a nigga wanna get a little off his mind
I'm a nigga that will hit a nigga off his time
Go off his spine, brains in the air
Flames to the hair cause the game ain't fair
And i'll take it there fuckin' with the right one baby
Got that, we tryin' to light one baby

[Hook]
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit here, I run shit
I run shit here, I run shit
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit, I run shit here
I run shit here, I run shit
I run shit here, I run shit

(Big Stan)
I've done shit here my guns spit here
Y'all might live here but I run shit here
Blood sweats and tears for years just to sit here
Think I'm about to let you niggas get here
Cowards are stupid if you wanna see me prove it
Try and take my position watch a quick a nigga lose it
Make you get all my shit and have you fearing for your life
Every time you see me roll up or ride up on a bike
Dressed in all black with my pistol in your sight
But it will be my man in all white that walks up with a knife
I'm a big boy baby I don't play with you thin niggas
Getting my hands dirty when there's beef I send niggas

[Hook]

[Intro: DMX]
Uhh, uhh, uhh, c'mon!
Woo!  Uh-huh
Yeah, more real life (grrrrrrrrrr)
That's how it is baby, you know it's real
More real life, you know it's real (grrrrrrrrrr)
From the dog, y'know?
You know it's real, uh-huh
You know it's real (grrrrrrrrrr)
Shit is always real baby, forever

[Verse 1: DMX]
My peoples say they got love for the dog, right?
They holla like "Whattup dog?" Alright
'Cause no matter what streets in a dog's life
And I'm the type of dog gon' go all night
Some cats think that it's a game that we're playin' here
You keep thinkin' it's a joke, I ain't playin' here
Fuck around if you want, I leave you laying there
Do what, go where?  Shit I'm stayin' here
This whole motherfuckin' rap shit is all mine (WHAT?!)
Just thought I'd let you know one mo' time (uhh)
Shit, I ain't said nuttin' when it was yo' time
Now, niggas is mad, 'cause Ain't No Sunshine
And you cats won't like it when the rain hits (UHH!)
That's the nigga X on the same shit (uh!)
And if you wanna see how fucked up the game gets?
Watch what they do when you ain't shit

[Chorus: Stephanie Mills]
What you gonna do when I'm nothing?
You're crazy about my styyyyyyyyyle
What you gonna do when I'm nothing?
Tell me nowwwwwwwwwww.. ohhhhh-ohhhhhh

[Verse 2: DMX]
Uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh
Every cat I meet like, "Show me love!"
Every girl I meet like, "I want a hug!"
Shit I might be just tryin' to pick somethin' up
Can I get an autograph -- man, what the fuck?!
Is the love gon' be the same when
We start to realize that the game ends (uh-huh)
Even me, will I have the same friends? (uhh)
Even when I ain't got the same Benz (UHH)
What about when the dough get low (woo!)
Shoulda peeped money from the get-go
Disappeared, ain't that a bitch yo?
Now you know, that's that bullshit yo
Can't forget all them fake "love you" bitches (uh-HUH!)
Take 'em to the room, wanna fuck you bitches (uh-HUH!)
Walk through the mall wanna touch you bitches (uh-HUH!)
Listen!  I got a wife, I don't trust you bitches (c'mon!)

[Chorus: Stephanie Mills]
What you gonna do when I'm nothing?
You're crazy about my styyyyyyyyyle
What you gonna do when I'm nothing?
Please don't have me acting wild
What you gonna do when I'm nothing?
Tell me nowwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
Tell me now, tell me now (WHAT?!)
Tell me (WHAT?!) what you gonna tell me? (WHAT?!)
Tell me (uh) tell me (uh)
What you gonna tell me?

[Verse 3: DMX]
Holla at the boy if you know the truth
See what I'm doin', I'm tryin' to show the youth
Trust me I been through it so I got the proof
Give 'em somethin' to eat that ain't gon' break a tooth
And everybody knows how I get down (c'mon)
Show the dog love when he hit town (c'mon)
They don't give a fuck who I'm with now (c'mon)
V.I.P. don't give a fuck where I sit now (aight?!)
All this shit changed but it's still the same
But you gotta do it in order to play the game
Keep shit brief when you say my name (f'real)
Give me the love, nigga fuck the fame (f'real)
When the shit is gone, where you gon' be? (hmmmmm)
When I look no more, what you gon' see? (hmmmmm)
Shit, a muh'fucker lookin' hungry (aight?!)
And even then, is you gon' love me?

[Chorus: Stephanie Mills]
What you gonna do when I'm nothing?
You're crazy about my styyyyyyyyyle
What you gonna do when I'm nothing?
Tell me nowwwwwwwwwww.. ohhhhh-ohhhh
What you gonna do when I'm nothing?
You're crazy about my styyyyyyyyyle
What you gonna do when I'm nothing?
Tell me nowwwwwwwwwww.. ohhhhh-ohhhh

[Stephanie and DMX ad lib to fade]

[DMX]
In the name of Jesus
Let us pray
Father please walk with us through the bad times as well as the good
May we be heard and understood from the suburbs to the hood
May you judge us by our hearts and not by our mistakes
And see that we get a breakthrough however long that it takes
May you fill that void in our souls that will lay our fears to rest
Cause there is no way we can live for Jesus when we're liven in the flesh
So I pray that you allow our sprits to be born
Grow strong, move on, know right from wrong
First John, chapter two, verse 15
Do not love the world or anything in the world
And we know what that means, but listen
We know the distance we need to be away from fire to keep it missin
That doesn't mean we'll listen
Lord you take care of fools and babies
You teach women to honor their men and men respect their ladies
But lately so many of us have gone a stray
Doing wrong for so long that we've forgotten the way
Please bring us back home, instill in us the word which is our backbone
We're just children that act grown
There is so much that we're entitled to yet we receive so little
Cause in this time of spiritual warfare we're comfortable in the middle
So I pray that you open our eyes
Give us the annointing to recognize the devil and his lies
If we keep our actions wise and our prays sincere
Our heads to the sky you will demonist our fears
In Jesus' mighty name we have prayed
Amen and amen

[Verse 1: DMX]
We all got guns, we all got dogs
We all gon' make that trip to the morgue
We all find it harder to see through the fog
We all know the difference between right and wrong
We should all live life by one fact
Before you doin dirt, the dirt gon' come right back
I seen cats go out like suckers
I seen cats get down like, "Yo, them some bad motherfuckers"
I see fake niggas and the games they play
Aiyyo, I deal with that bullshit e'ry day
But that ain't gon' stop me from doin what I'm doin
I got things beside bullshit to be pursuing
It's that craft for me, the half of me
Let through niggas in the door after me
Yo, somebody stop me; please, somebody come and get me
If I go, I'm taking niggas with me!

[Hook: Styles P.] - repeat 2X
Dog nigga, Ghost nigga
Hop the bar with the toast nigga
It's like the Lord getting close nigga
It's personal, now we gotta smoke niggas
It's personal, now we gotta host niggas

[Verse 2: Styles P.]
(Dog nigga, what up!) Nigga fuck the cop and the warrant
You get a chance, pop an informant
All I need is a Glock and I'm touring
Hit every hole in the wall, have me a ball
And then slide the fuck out in the top of the morning
If you hear me cockin it on 'em, I'm poppin it on 'em
I don't fuck around nigga, better stop it and mourn 'em
And who the fuck asked you to rhyme?
I'm the Ghost, when I come around, they throwing up the hazardous sign
And you ain't around chemicals, just around generals
Who spend, passing they time, blasting they nine
Rather die with my man then the five for ya livewire
Spend half of ya time, smashing ya spine
Other half we getting money and more money
You think about cars, I got "goin to war" money
That P and that dog money, we still in the front of the store, money
And if anybody slip, they getting sent to the morgue, money

[Hook w/ Jadakiss adlibs] - repeat 2X

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
It's like lately I've been feeling so weak at the knees
And speaking to niggas is just like speaking to thieves
So I keep the hawk ready to eat 'em
Guess already? Then meet 'em
I'm fair game, but I'm ready to cheat 'em
The streets ain't right now, the Colgate White is light brown
These niggas ain't nice, they nice clowns
That's why I'mma start layin them right down
And have 'em there layin in the casket, ice down
Jacob watch on 'em, mortician must've been hazed up
Cause you can see the makeup spots on 'em
This is way beyond ya Avion
The Golden King, more like Polo Spring
And what makes it even worse, aiyyo it's that it's personal
Maybe even ya Earth can go
I'll make it where they can never find the bitch
Right outta the bar, with all kind of shit

[Hook] - repeat 2X

[Outro: Styles P.]
Yeah, y'all niggas can get caught up in the hype if you want
Bodies drop over here, this is not a game man
You wanna get caught up in the hype again? Then you can fall in the hype again
This is a movement, Double R, nigga you know what's up
And if you don't, you gon' get to know what's up
Yeah, we ain't playin wit' y'all niggas this year
'06, '07, and on, nigga what's up?

[Verse 1]
One more time
I gots to hit the streets off
Make the streets talk, let 'em know it ain't a sweet walk
This gon' be
The only joint made this year that'll knock 'til 2003
And y'all gon' see
That the hottest nigga out there was, is, and will be me
Just like that
I can go away for a minute
Do some other shit, but bounce right back
And when it's on, I'm coming strapped
With some shit that'll spit from dusk 'til dawn
And when you gone
Ain't no coming back in the morn'
Like that shit was a dream, nigga, you gone
That's for real
Creep niggas like a SEAL
Tote the steel, stick a nigga, make him squeal
Oh, my God
Those can't be the last words of your man
Damn, your man was so hard (Come on)

[Chorus]
Bring it, what?

Here we go again
How many million did my last one sell?
Fuck it, I'm going for ten
It's never gon' stop
And every fuckin' time I hit you
It's going straight to the top of the charts
The champion
I'm a thoroughbred, my blood is strong
And I scratch 'til you done
Cross the line
And ain't no more scratches after that
Straight up, niggas is dyin'
Yo, what the fuck is you cats doing?
Running around like this, like you won't get stuck?
Yo, that's my word
I stay givin' it to niggas
And I stay not really being heard
But, y'all gon' see
That the same thing thou did to them will be done to thee
And then you'll know
That sometimes though you come through the front, you leavin' out the backdoor (Come on)

[Chorus]
Bring it, what?

[Verse 3]
Bring the noise
And you better come with niggas you don't give a fuck about
'Cause you gon' lose your boys
'Cause we don't play
And the silencer will silence any cocksucker with somethin' to say
Dog for life
Whether I'm on or off the leash, I bite, streets are my life
Click, click, boom
Another life taken too soon, another mother had a funeral
Still waters run deep
And the pain is forever alive inside, makes it hard to sleep
But I keep goin', goin'
Shit, I'm always careful when I walk, I'm always seein', knowin'
The dog gon' live
Stay walkin' the wire, over the fire, when I can, I give
The dog is good
And how it's stayin'
Dog gon' fuck with the hood 'til dog fuck with the wood

[Chorus]
Bring it, what?
We right here
We're not goin' anywhere
We right here
This is ours and we don't share

So if it's must you test us, we can handle it the streets, nigga, fuck makin' records

Oh, yeah, PS, fuck Mr. Roarke and Tattoo, AKA Jerry and Eazy

But, but, but you know what I want them to do for me?

And work them like a strizzaw and tell me what you sizzaw

Really though, it's Death Row, nigga!
You better ask somebody, you really better ask somebody!

[Outro: Dr. Dre]
Get out, get out, I don't love you no more
Yeah, nigga, you's a penguin-lookin' motherfucker

[Intro: Roger E. Mosley & RBX]
You really don't understand, do you?
Hey man, don't you realize in order for us to make this thing work, man, we've got to get rid of the pimps, and the pushers and the prostitutes?
And then start all over again clean
Nigga, is you crazy?
Once again, the mighty Death Row organization committin' mass murder
And we ain't askin' for shit, nigga, we takin' it
So, Dre, blast they ass, nigga!

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg]
Rat-tat-tat-tat late at night with my gat
On the streets of L.A. wonderin' where the pussy at
Straight player, looking for a ho
Hangin' out, rollin' in my six-four
Sixteen switches for the niggas in my hood
Seventeen shells so I make it understood
Stay back, lay back, way back in the cut
Ya come outside, nigga, ya gettin' fucked up
I done told ya, creep-creep, ya best move
Like Luther Vandross, I'm fuckin' up the west coast
I'm right back up in ya when ya nut
One, two, three nut, from the D-R-E but
This is for the hoes that I used to know
When I didn't have my sixty-four and a lot of dough
I keep it like this and like that, and I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back

[Chorus: Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg & RBX]
Rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat, like that, and I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
Rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat, like that, and I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back

[Skit]
Ooh-wee, that's that nigga owe you that grip
Yeah, there that fool is (Well, what's up? Break him off proper then)
What's up? What's happenin'? (Can I get them ends?) What's up?
Nigga, you delinquent, can I get those ends? (I ain't)
Ayy, nigga, pay this nigga (He ain't trippin'), well, what's up?
Man, I ain't got your money (Go 'head) Well, yo, check this out, nigga
What's up, fool? What's up? What's up? You don't want—
Yeah, motherfucker
I'll be back, yo, I'll be back! (Oh yeah?) You ain't never comin' back, fool

[Pre-Chorus: Snoop Dogg & Dr. Dre]
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back (Yeah, nigga)

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg & RBX, Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg]
Rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat, like that, you know I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back

Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
Rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat, like that, you know I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back (Yeah)
Rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat, like that, and I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Creepin' and peepin' and we can get with these
The Chronic, slangin' fat ki's from my block
And it don't stop, tell me where you wanna go
To the strip, or take a trip ballin' with the Row
My shit off in ya system attacks
Indo smoke go in ya lungs like that
You get lifted, calm, and if it's the bomb
Taken away like Calgon, Vietnam
California, back and on a mission
Provin' a point, in my game, ain't no fuckin' competition
They wishin' but run up on reality
C-P-T, C-A-L my locality
It's strange how I re-arrange and change
The business by droppin' shit like this
Dope, niggas can't cope with the real
I bill, penitentiary steel, when I kill, it goes

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & Dr. Dre, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg & RBX]
Rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat, like that, and I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back (Yeah)
Rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat, like that, you know I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back
Rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat, like that, and I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back (Hell yeah)
Rat-tat-tat-tat, tat-ta-tat, like that, you know I
Never hesitate to put a nigga on his back

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Straight up
Now you niggas know where my homie comin' from
So quit the chit-chat 'fore you find yourself flat on your bizzack, fool
It's nine-deuce, Dr. Drizzay's sittin' on tizzop
It don't stop, treatin' busters like a punk-ass cizzop
Biatch!

[Intro: RBX & Ruben]
Cannabis Sativa, haha
Or in the heart of LA known as the chronic
Not to be confused with the bionic
Even though it does cost six million dollars, man, understand?
Haha, now we working with some new improved shit on this track
Nevertheless, not no stress, sucker-ass niggas
So now we're gon' move on and, uh, light a big fat one up for the world
And hit this once or twice and you'll be twice as nice
Get it? This is the chronic, haha
Blaze that motherfucker up then, nigga

[Chorus: Emmage & Ruben, Dat Nigga Daz]
Make my bud the chronic, I wants to get fucked up
Make my shit the chronic, I gots to fire it up
I want the bomb, I want the chronic, I gots to get fucked up
Make my bud the chronic before I take it home (Yeah)

[Interlude: RBX, Dat Nigga Daz, The Lady of Rage]
Damn, my last joint, don't fuck with me, fool
Pass the bud
Who got the dub sacks?

Hoo-wee, this shorter than a motherfucker, man
You can take it or leave it, nigga
But I need a spliff right now
Roll this shit up then, nigga, and pass it
And I don't want no cess, brother
It's got to be the chronic, know what I mean, nigga?
Yeah, that's the chronic (Damn, it sure is), that's the chronic
That's the bomb bud (You ain't never lyin')
Now, get me a motherfuckin' Zig-Zag and we're straight
Yeah, nigga, I got some
Or better yet, a motherfuckin' blunt (I got that shit)
A Philly blunt that is
Here you go

[Chorus: Emmage & Ruben]
Make my bud the chronic, I wants to get fucked up
Make my shit the chronic, I gots to fire it up

God damn, I'm fucked up
You ain't lyin', I'm fucked up too, God (Yeah)
That shit ain't no joke, ooh, shit (Ain't no joke, fuck)
Nah, I don't want no more, I don't want shit
Just leave me alone, just let me just chill out and listen to this shit
What your mind doin', nigga? You can't hang? What the fuck's wrong?
I'm high, that's fucked up, damn

[Chorus: Emmage & Ruben, RBX, The Lady of Rage]
Make my bud the chronic, I wants to get fucked up

[Interlude: RBX, The Lady of Rage, Emmage]
(That nigga Dre serving up some shit now)
Ooh, I'm ready to fuck some shit up now, baby
Hell, you can come on and fuck me up
Mm-hmm, (Uh-huh), triple cheeseburger
Oh, you talkin' about some food, I got some...

And hot apple turnover and all that old shit, nigga
Ooh, I'm ready to get my munch on (Me too)
That bud smell good than a motherfucker too

That shit is not to be fucked with, not to be fucked with
I'm high, ooh, nigga, you pass that shit to somebody else
Nigga, I'm through for the night, I mean really though
Really though, nigga, let's go get some food, let's get up out this motherfucker
(Nah, man, we gonna go back and meet up with Dre)
'Cause, uh (For real, you ain't never lyin')

Nigga, I told you, I'm cool, I don't want nothin' else
I'm out of here

[Outro: Ruben]
Ha, I got another dub sack, nigga, haha

[Intro: Knoc-turn'al]
Super ugly!

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Put your cups up, get your smoke in
Baby, we partying, ain't nobody loc'n
Who you provoking, what you want now?
Take a look around, it's pimp shit goin down
It's a lot of bitches, a whole lot of freaks
Top notch hoes, they flock in every week
What you wan' do, get your next thrill
Take an X pill, how the sex feel?
Damn you lookin good, all ten of y'all
Wanna roll (yeaaah!), I'm dicking y'all
Keep your face down, keep your ass up
You know what your doing, keep that shit moving
Keep them titties jumping, keep the Henny coming
Every bitch in here need to be touching something
I know they like it hot, that's why I keep it hot
So how the fuck could they not want a piece of Doc?

[Chorus: Knoc-turn'al & (Dr. Dre)]
I don't give a fuck cause I'm just
Drinkin, smokin, straight West-coasting
Bitches puttin ass in motion
Pussy poppin, sex promotin
Got a cup? (Raise it up)
Got a blunt? (Blaze it up)
That's your bitch? (On these nuts)
Really I don't (Give a fuck)
All I really know is your ho wants to be with me, and she ain't playin'
And what I'm sayin'
She creeps with me
And sleeps, between the sheets

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Soon as the door close
I make 'em curl toes, they all wanna get chose
We never love y'all, my niggas all macks
We sip a lot of Yak, fuck and never call back
Pack women in the club until it's pitch black
Thugs on their block wonderin where their bitch at
Where you think nigga? She with the Aftermath
Called her house, she ain't home, she with Aftermath
No talkin, fuck how your day go
You want dick (yeeeaah!), will bitch say so
Don't be shy now, probably the best at it
They say a party ain't a party until the west at it
Gravitate to the Doc like it's automatic
Take your clothes off, make me wanna grab it
Turn around with it, make me wanna stab it (yeaah)
Time to get it crackin, show me them bad habits (oooh)

[Chorus: Knoc-turn'al & (Dr. Dre)]
I don't give a fuck cause I'm just
Drinkin, smokin, straight West-coasting
Bitches puttin ass in motion
Pussy poppin, sex promotin
Got a cup? (Raise it up)
Got a blunt? (Blaze it up)
That's your bitch? (On these nuts)
Really I don't (Give a fuck)
All I really know is your ho wants to be with me, and she ain't playin'
And what I'm sayin'
She creeps with me
And sleeps, between the sheets

[Post-Chorus: Knoc-turn'al]
When she's all alone she sneaks out to be with me
And what I'm sayin is she ain't playin (she creeps with me)
And sleeps, between the sheets

[Outro: Dr. Dre]
Yeah, Aftermath, Doc Dre, 5-star surgeon general (yeaaah!)
Nocturnal, L.A. Confidential (yeaaah!)
What up Infinite, Mahagony droppin the instrumental (yeaaah!)
Do the math, Aftermath gets the last laugh (yeaaah!)

[Intro: Dr. Dre as The Vice President]
Gentlemen!! ~ We have a problem
That hath the potential; to become a very serious problem!
The Eastcoast and Westcoast seperation
Is exactly the weapon our enemies need to destroy our empire (*Echoes*)
So what we need to do! ~ is bring together
Some of the biggest, strongest and smartest fustiest in the millennium
And this will be the begining of The Aftermath! (*Echoes*)

[Duet Hook: Dr. Dre & Scarface X2]
East coast "killer" - West coast "killer"
East coast "killer" - West coast "killer"
East coast "killer" - West coast "killer"
East coast "killer" - West coast "killer"
Kill that noise!

[Interlude #1: RBX]
The Mighty mighty Aftermath, hath now just forced to rise
Ha ha ha ha ha, indeed, indeed

[Verse One: RBX]
While childish MC's battle over coastal fronts
I come with no fronts and smash in monkey fronts
If you want to be evil like Knieval then jump
I guarantee your punk ass catch the speed lump
The tactics, extract, morbid thoughts from the mental
Custom designed, for instrumental
Yes indeedy, lyrical graffiti
And this one is a burner, baby
Truck, like Toyata driven
True and living, driving with the gat
Uhh.. pop the clutch, let the Cold Crush rush
Then I flush whack material
That's if I don't mash them all to mush
Hush, let me burst, dare I gush
Cock-diesel cuts
Lyrical arsenal equivalent to arsenic
The Aftermath

[Duet Hook: Dr. Dre & Scarface X2]

[Verse Two: KRS-One]
Yo, why do they make me wanna ruin they career?
Before I bust your shit, let's get one thing clear
Don't provoke Kris no joke this
I don't ride no rapper's nutsack, yo, I stay focused
Beefing without skills seeking will only weaken
The artist speaking over beats and.. you be cheating
Cause half of these non-talent rappers
Claiming a coast over instrumentals
And got no real street credentials
Here come the philosopher Hip-Hopping you correctly
Ignorant ass MC's continue to attempt me
Lyrics be empty like Alcatraz cellblock
Too many MC's rapping causing lyrical gridlock
Lyrical syllables interlock in my voicebox
Yet I'm still unknown like the X on Sadat
Cause your typical, non-topical
Flex the optical illusion, weak metaphoric style you be using
I check one-two's and who's in the house
Like shit your lyrics ooze out your mouth
What you think this is? ~ KRS-One from the Bronx kid!

[Interlude #2: Dr. Dre]
Paranoidly giggling

[Duet Hook: Dr. Dre & Scarface X2]

[Interlude #3: Quote from unknown movie]
Welcome to the New World Order
You are now under martial law
All constitutional rights had been suspended

[Verse Three: B-Real]
The most scandalous, cut the bad apple, we can handle this
Coast tripping going on through out the business
East Coast/West Coast anybody killer!
I don't give a fuck where you from, I'ma Killa, Hill-er
I got crews on both sides together
Deeper than the ocean and down for whatever
Fool, I can roll through any block
From Central to Westland Avenue, without my Glock
But some niggas can't survive on both sides
So they try and break off, eliminate ties
Fools got to get wise, better realize
True, enemy lies killing in the highrise
Office, analyzing the song
Look at them Rap niggas, don't even get along
Kill that noise, four niggas bringing the skill
Mad caps get peeled, if you opposed the Hill

[Interlude #4: RBX]
Yeah, that's right fool, you know who
The mighty Group Therapy, the mighty mighty Aftermath brigade
Letting all you sound boys know
You're not ready to rumble or test this
Kill that noise!

[Duet Hook: Dr. Dre & Scarface X2]

[Verse Forth: Nas]
Now when I bomb like Sadaam, the world feels The Wrath of Khan
Desert Storm in this modern day Babylon
I be the twelve disciples strap arms
All black on, running your spot, hit the safe and I'm gone
Like a thief wrong, I keep the long 38 warm
Silent and calm, and blackout when the beef is on
Focus on your rap holsters, notice
I'm evil like the Exorcist to the locusts
Ferocious thoughts, are merging at night
Like Jehovah towards the virgin in white
I'm wrapped in a turban for spite
Like a Israelite snatching whores up, my flow's up
When the fucking world blows up (*Explosion*)
Throw your hands up, it's a holdup
Fronting like you down for the real; to make a meal
But when plan fold, nigga, you squeal like Heavy Heel

[RBX:] Kill that Noise!!

[Nas:] But what's the fucking deal?

[Real] Anybody killer!!

[Duet Hook: Dr. Dre & Scarface X2]

[Interlude #5: Dr. Dre]
YEAH!! YEAH!! YEAH!!
Artist: Dr. Dre featuring Snoop Doggy Dogg
Album: Death Row Greatest Hits
Song: Lil' Ghetto Boy (remix)

The Ghetto x8

Snoop Doggy Dogg:

Wake up, jumped out my bed
I'm in a two man cell with my homie Lil' 1/2 Dead
Murder was the case that they gave me
Dear God, I wonder can you save me?
I'm only eighteen, so I'm a young buck
It's a ride, if I don't scrap, I'm gettin' stuck
But that's the life of G, I guess
Ese's way deep, shanked two in the chest
Best run cause brothers is droppin' quicker
Ugn, too late, damn, down goes another nigga
Bouncin' off the walls, throwin' them dogs
Gettin' that rep as a young hog
It ain't nothin' like the street life
You better be strapped with your shank
Cause ain't no fist fight
So I guess I gots to handle mine
Since I did the crime, I gots to do my time
Chorus:

We run game in the ghetto
We gets high in the ghetto
We gets shot in the ghetto
You might get stuck in the ghetto
Lil' Ghetto Boy

Dr. Dre:

Now I'm holdin' the dub, sittin' on swoll
Twenty-seven years old, up for parole, stroll
I'm back up on my feet with my mind on the money
That I be makin' soon as I touch them streets
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump, but now they blast, right?
But it ain't no thang to me
Cause now I'm what they call a loced ass O.G
The little homies from the hood with grip
Are the ones I get with cause I'm down to set trip
Nigga, I'm bigger than you, so whatcha wanna do?
Didn't know he had a twenty-two
Straight sittin' behind his back
I grabbed his pockets and then I heard six caps
I fell to the ground with blood on my hands
I didn't understand
How a nigga so young could bust a cap
I used to be the same way back
I guess that's what I get (for what?)
For tryin' to jack the little homies for they grip
Chorus

Snoop Doggy Dogg:

Somethin' for the real O.G.'s to get with
Some facts made our made
Now you runnin' but I'm played
Like every single day, really doe
You know me, I'm the smooth macadamian
Gamin'em for my homie
No need in be uncalm, if you pack right
And learnin' just enough to keep your sack tight
Late nights, I wonder what they get in for?
Early mornin' on the corners, what they hittin' for?
Seven young G's put they serve down
In a G ride, Eastside's where they swerve now
Not thinkin' about what's really goin' on
Got crept on, stepped on, now they gone
I spent four years in the county
With nothin' but convicts around me
But now I'm back at the Pound
And we expose ways for the youth to survive
Some think it's wrong but we tend to think it's right
So make all them ends you can make
Cause when you're broke, you break, check it out
So ain't no need for your mama to trip
Cause you's a hustlin' ass youngsta, clockin' your grip
Chorus

Lil' Ghetto Boy

That's the life of a G, I guess
The ghetto. x3

That's the life of a G
That's the life of a G, I guess
The ghetto. x3

That's the life of a G. The ghetto
That's the life of a G, I guess
The ghetto

[Intro: Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg]
(I can feel it!)
Yeah, and you don't stop
It's still 1-8-7 on a motherfuckin' cop
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a motherfuckin' cop

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Niggas that I used to know and sold dope wit'
Listen to how a motherfucker flow shit
And let me know it's somethin' they can blast on
Thinkin' about the homies that passed on
Death Row come to show you where all the game at
And show you how my label got the name that
So many wanna see me in, time is money
But never in the P-E-N, yo
Welcome back to Vietnam, California
Ain't a damn thing changed, so let me warn ya
Every motherfuckin minute you on the Westside
The best side, 20 niggas done just died
Walkin' down the streets of L.A
Stay strapped 'cause niggas bust caps every day, yo
The 1-8-7 don't stop
On undercover cops up on the spot gettin' popped, shot
Droppin' like this and like that
Rat-tat-tat-tat with their caps peelin' back
So creep when you in the C-P-T
You catch heat for fuckin' with' the D-R-E
I got my eyes on the shit unfoldin'
And there ain't gonna be no trippin'
'Cause they know the type of shit that I be holdin'
If there's another word said
I'll let my .44 go buck to the head, nigga

[Hook: Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a motherfuckin' cop
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a motherfuckin' cop

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg & Dr. Dre]
3 and to the 2 and 2 and to the 1
Head away, sent away, get away, Snoop's got a gun
And he's lookin' for the cops who set him up in '86
Now it's time to put they ass in the mix
Back on the streets with my khakis and my stars
Nuts full of cavi and I'm headed for the bar
Scared than a muthafucka, 'cause I'm fresh out
But I gots to make my green, and plus they all fiend
Follow me, they keep yellin' murder, but it won't stop
Until the last nigga that you know drop
Another nigga out, but I doubt
That you really give a fuck what it's about
Now, 99 pigs on a block with me
Not a muthafuckin' cop wanna knock with me
A C-O-N-V-I-C-T
The motherfuckin' D-O-G, comin' from the L-B-C
Look at what the Doc brought in
A chrome .38, a .44 mag, and Mac 10
So what you wanna do? (What you wanna do?)
I got the gauge, a Uzi and my mothafuckin' .22
So if you wanna blast, nigga, we can buck 'em
If we stick 'em then we stuck 'em so fuck 'em!
(I can feel it!)

[Hook: Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a motherfuckin' cop
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a motherfuckin' cop

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg & Dr. Dre]
Splat to a motherfucker face, he fall
Strong muthafucka 'cause he starts to crawl
I guess I gots to load the Glock again
Hit 'im with the hollow points and watch him spin
Fuck it, I had to do this quick
Grabbed the Glock 17, the clip went click
Tried to detect, but did not detect perfect
So I creep on that ass, pops him and drops him
That ought to stop from beatin' up blacks
Dead in his tracks, from a full six pack
Relax, 'cause I'm about to take my respect
I aimed the 12 gauge straight for his neck
Boo-yaa! Boo-yaa! Then I fade into the wind
1-8-7 and it's on again
Well it's on, and it's on, and it's on, and it's on
Fo'-fo' Desert Eagle to your motherfuckin' dome
And it's on, and it's on, and it's on, and it's on
Fo'-fo' Desert Eagle to your motherfuckin' dome
Fuck 'em, buck 'em, if they really wanna trip
Niggas, keep your hands on your motherfuckin' shit

[Hook: Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a motherfuckin' cop
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a motherfuckin' cop
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a motherfuckin' cop
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a motherfuckin' cop
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a motherfuckin' cop

[Dr. Dre]
You in the office of the good doc again, let's walk again
It's like clock again, the hood rock again
You should pop it in,ain't take it out
That shit Dre on, you can't make it out
The world ain't set for what I'm about to do
Ninety-six tracks mixed down to two
I stepped out the booth, called up Snoop
Like toucan, Dre got colorful loops

[Snoop Dogg]
We can shoot, we can scrap
We can rap, we can act
We can mack these bitches, whatever you want
Ol' bitch ass niggas think it's better to front

[Dr. Dre]
How it be on the West, forever the hunt

[Snoop Dogg]
But I won't wear no bull's eye (Bull's eye eye)
Bull's eye is how these fools die (Die die)
Waitin' on school by (By by)
Have you on the news by (By)

[Dr. Dre]
Y'all know how the story goes
We give a fuck about award shows

[Snoop Dogg]
Same shit about hoes

[Dr. Dre]
Real niggas own platinum balls
I ain't got it on my neck nigga check my walls

Yo I see how the world can't see these Eastsidaz
All y'all wanna criticize, fuckin' with us tryin' to get a ride
That's when my shit flies

[Snoop Dogg]
And here's where the pimp lies

[Dr. Dre]
I spit game at the globe
First week deuce five

[Hook: Kokane]
I'd rather be ridin' than walkin'
While all you loud mouth niggas keep talkin'
All you high paid niggas stay fly
I'mma slide left, fly right on by
I'mma do it on the boulevard
Fast bitches, fast cars and stars
Stayin' bossed up eatin' caviar
Lookin' for the next play to have it all, ah nah

[Dr. Dre with Snoop rapping along]
It's funny how the game goes
New face but they look like the same hoes
I try to get away, everybody wanna hit of Dre
Stay focused, bang I done hit a day

[Snoop Dogg]
Nigga fuck what cha' heard, shit is all lies
Niggas mad Dre and Snoop stayin' multi

[Dr. Dre]
Fuck y'all, wanna slice and it's all mine

[Snoop Dogg]
My career in fifth gear while y'all's dyin'

[Dr. Dre]
You thinkin' California all sun and surf, for sho'
I can see you walkin' under the Earth

[Snoop Dogg]
My gun burst em'

[Dr. Dre]
And I still got my first mil
Still bounce till I feel like the Earth tilt

[Snoop Dogg]
Every club, Dre and Snoop loudest
G-Funk, get it crunk like the Dirty South
Hold ya mouth, you ain't worth a third of me

[Dr. Dre]
A word from me, exclusive as a surgery
But I don't use a scalpel, chainsaw shoppin'
My fingerprints all over the top ten

[Snoop Dogg]
Like that

[Dr. Dre]
Whole staff'll come through and spin
Either on the film or the two-inch wheel
Behind the wheel of a sixty-four
I can't stop till I done fifty totes

[Snoop Dogg]
Y'all motherfuckers know me
I smoke a lot of weed, sayin' fuck a pass like Kobe

[Hook]

[Kokane x4]
Rock on, rock on, keep movin' on
Groovin' on and hold ya on

[Hook]

[Intro: Dr. Dre]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yo, yo, let's do this shit
"I tawt I taw a puddy tat"
You's a punk-ass nigga
Yo, yeah
Yo, Death Row's in the motherfuckin' house
Wreckin' shit, you know what I'm sayin'?
This is Dr. Dre in the motherfuckin' house
Yo, I got my homeboys in the house
Tha Dogg Pound's definitely in here, ye-yahhh!
I got my nigga Kurupt ready to wreck some shit
Yo, you know what else I got in the house?
Yo, so diggi-Daz, step up on that ass
Yeah, guess what's in here?
My homegirl Rage, I said my homegirl Rage
Yeah, the lyrical motherfuckin' murderer's in here
Yo, my nigga Glove behind the boards
Yo, droppin' that funky-ass bassline, yeah
You know, you know there's a lot of punk-ass niggas out there
A lot of punk-ass bitches out there
Yo you wanna write names?
Yo, that nigga Eazy-E, he's a punk-ass bitch, really though
Yo, that nigga Tim M-U-T, he's a punk-ass biatch! Biatch!
You know what I'm sayin'?
Oh, oh, oh Luke, I didn't forget about you, biatch!
Really though
Yo, Death Row's in the motherfuckin' house
Running the 9-tre, you know, yeah
But right about now
There's a little freestyle session going on, in the studio
We just kickin' back, gettin' fucked up and all
You know, puffin' on a few blunts
Drinking on a little bit of that Tanqueray, Tanqueray
Yeah, Tanqueray's definitely in the house
You know what I'm sayin'?
'Cause I'm feelin' it, baby
I'm feelin' it, really though
So, uh, right about now, a-yo Rage
Yo, Rage, yo, run that shit, G!

[Verse 1: Lady of Rage]
Always and forever, forever and always
The rhythm will flow from now and through all days
As long as the sun shine
As long as Eisenhower's on the dime
Yo, I'll be kickin' the rhyme
One time for your mind, your soul, your body
The OG's on the side of me
Smooth as E&J, hard as Bacardi
Smackin' those yaddy-yacks ducks that keep quackin'
Hens that are cacklin' end up cracklin'
Under the heat, the pressure from the one that's deffer
Egyptian ruler, call me Cleo or Nefertiti, yes indeedy
Got the eyes that are beady, body from Tahiti
Voice of the wind, lyrics blowwww
Chills up your spine I send, so
All thoughts in your mind, drop 'em, yo
You came in the front, but you'll be kicked through the back door
If you try to step, try to come incorrect
Try to play the left, try to start a mess
Try to cause fuss, try to raise a ruckus
Huh, you'll end up ashes to ashes, dust to dust
A busta, you musta been buggin' on drugs and alcohol
Back off, all of y'all, up against the wall, spread 'em!
Doggs — go get 'em!
Hand-cuff 'em and stuff 'em, cold shut 'em, don't let 'em
Utter a word, not to mother or herd
If you try, you die, vision blurred, speech slurred
Served with a cherry on top
Rage in effect, I've just begun to rock
Yeaaaah, rock on witcha bad self (Rage!)
Rock on witcha bad self (Rage!)
Rock on witcha bad self (Rage!)
Rock on witcha bad self

[Verse 2: Dat Nigga Daz]
Yo, I'm Dat Nigga Daz that pack this tre-8 slug
A true nigga from the hood, and Tha Pound gives love
You see, niggas wanna be down, but never came around
So back up off of my nuts, and stop sweatin' Tha Pound
You see, niggas get broke off like 1, 2, 3
'Cause I'm the D-A-to-tha.. the D-A-to-tha-Z
Now G'z, pay attention to this young ass mack daddy
In a Caddy, had he
Not known about the city where the niggas hang around
So I roll 'em up, and hit 'em up with Tha motherfuckin' Dogg Pound

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
I'm rough and rugged, and up to do dirt
I'm from Tha Dogg Pound, nigga, so I'm puttin' in work
I'm no joke, who the fuck you tryin' to provoke?
(1-8-7) — It's Cold how his ass got smoked
I don't drink no fuckin' V-S-O-P
I drink the motherfuckin' O.G. Ol' E!
I'm from the clique that be kickin' the gangsta shit, bitch
Real niggas, real G'z with real big dicks
I hit 'em up with Tha Pound, so what you wanna throw up?
Claimin' you're cocaine or cavi when you blow up
Know what? Tha Pound's in the motherfuckin' house back again
We try to get high as we can
Dr. Dre be kickin' phat rhymes, the producer kick shit
I gets more wicked than Beetlejuice
Motherfuckers get battered, so scatter before I keep ya hostage
A nigga hostile like the grim reaper
So, I'm comin' from my hood, what hood?
You really like to know, wouldn't you? I thought you knew
Motherfucker, don't you know I'm stranded on the Row?
I take a look into the crowd, kick a style a flow
I'm maxin', motherfuckers get murdered for action
Relax, kid, you're rollin' with a fuckin' assassin
I last did dirt the other day
Portray the role of a G, from Tha D-O-double-G P-O-U-N-D, Pound
So bow-bow, motherfuckin' marks
The execution starts when the Chronic gets sparked
I'm like Barkley, rough and rugged, but raw like Rawhead
Rex, I flex murderous rhymes to leave you all dead
What's said is what's said, it's already spoke
The dead is the dead, I ain't no fuckin' joke!
I murder motherfuckers as a hobby
One of my idols Ain't No Joke, so why in the fuck should I be?
Fly me, to the Bahamas, ruff rhymer
Drama's what you're kickin', wicked is how I'mma
Approach ya, the locster, who's quick to up and smoke ya
You're lookin' like a smoker, grinnin' like a joker
I yoke you from da back like a bitch talkin' shit
'Cause a bitch ain't shit but a hoe and trick on my dick
Flip, let's take a trip to Tha Dogg Pound
Fools tried to punk me when I was young, but I'm a hog now
And I gets respect, and I step with a TEC-9
Ready to put somethin' up in dat ass, so you'll respect mine, fool
Death Row ain't Lynchin' and Tha Pound ain't Mobbin'
We all don't give a fuck, run in ya crib and start robbin'
Throbbin', I'm breakin' niggas down in the 90's
Maxin' at Tha Pound with my doggs is where you'll find me, biatch!

[Outro: Dr. Dre]
Heell yeaah!
You niggas can't fade this shit, you know what I'm sayin'?
Death Row's in the motherfuckin' houuuuuse!
The Dogg Pound's definitely in hereeee, you knowhatI'msayin'?
And a-yo yo yo yo yo, you niggas can't FUCK with this
So don't even try it
Stay in the studio all you want, stay in the studio all you want
'Cause you can't FUCK with this
SEE YA! Hahaha!

[Snoop]
Now I be mobbing like a motherfucker every single day
Making funky shit with my nigga Dr. Dre
The niggas who talk shit get put on they back
By my nigga named Suge and his black for black
Now check facts for a second, I'm checking my record's dope
It's Snoop, he goes for broke, so what's up, Loc?
You wanna provoke, try to step, break your neck real quick
Real fast, blast, I'll outlast and shoot ya, take your cash
As I dash with the homies from the Dub
Now as we fly through the sky getting love
We how high, real high, how high, I'm higher than you
So whatchu wanna do, whatchu wanna do?

[Interlude: Snoop]
Ha ha, yeah, and you don't stop
And you don't stop
This ain't nothing but a motherfucking freestyle worth your while
(This is for the Dogg Pound, this Daz, the nigga of all niggas!)

[Snoop]
Check it out
Bow wow wow yippy yo yippy yay
The Dogg Pound's in the motherfuckin' house
C'mon, bow wow wow yippy yo yippy yay
The Dogg Pound's in the motherfuckin' house
Ayo stepping through the front door, stealing the show
It's the youngest motherfucker on the hood Death Row
He's called Daz, stepping on your ass
Making big cash, time to move real fast, blast
Check it out, next in line
Is the diggy diggy DOC dropping funky classical rhymes
That shit that just don't hit
Snoop Dogg and Dre, dropping funky manuscripts
My lip hits the microphone
Breaks you, shakes you, takes you, awakes you
Kurupt the Kingpin of killing is straight chillin'
Step into the house and start revealing your skills
Chill, do you need the microphone
Or do you need some help to drop some shit like stones?
Al Capone was a hero of mine
I shot plenty niggas and cops so fuck one-time
I'm, the irrelevant, intelligent
Brother from the hood that they call Long Beach
Eastside where the brothers ride, slide
Slippidy slide, the Eastside's got pride
Here we go, stole the show as I flow
I gots to give the microphone to my homie on the Row
His name's Kurupt, he fucks it up
On Crenshaw and Slauson, so commence to flossing

[Kurupt]
When I step I come straight from the under
Lyrical rhymes will flex, but yo, here's my cover
Kingpin, murderer, etcetera, I flex
When I flow I let 'em know that I'm quick to snap necks
Check me out, one two, don't disrespect (Boom)
The way I flow I go and show you'll get chin checked
And if you ever feel you got the wrath, what can you say?
Spray the AK, produced by Dr. Dre
My niggy niggy nigga by the name of D.O.C
My homie Snoop Dogg and Daz is next to me
The D-A to the Z, the D-R to the E
And when we like to flex down with the S-H-U-G
I break 'em off when I flow I go and now they know
The Row will kill with skills, I'm real for real
And caps I peel from my steel
So nigga, you figure that you're bigger, and pass
I'll whip your ass, it's a classical rhyme from Daz

[Daz]
Yo, I bust through the hood, I bust through the fog
My nigga D-O-G, um, Doggy Dogg, but if they play
But if they wanted to say "Pow Pow!" goes another
Hit from my um nigga Dr. Dre
The Chronic, which they get up on it
As the niggas be saying that it's ahhhhhh, bionic
But I'm trying to go as I play and then I say
Never underestimate the nigga Dr. Dre... (fades out)

[Intro: Dr. Dre]
Yeah, I'm just sittin' in the lab, I'm...
My name is Dr. Dre, and
I want all you mothafuckers out there to know
That I have a split personality (*Mr. Ski chuckles*)
And sometimes I just, exit through these things, you know
Ha ha, you know, hell yeah..

[Break: E-A-Ski]
Mr. Ski nigga
I'm takin' over shit Dre
Laughing

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Diagnosis, multiple personality disorder of modern day
With modern tech, jugglin' hard in a Leg' versus manslaughter
I took a swig of the potion and it sent me coastin'
With visions of my Alter-Ego hittin' three wheel motion
"Is it Dre, is it Dre"
No that Ski in a purple 6-tray G.T.A
Killin' any mothafucker walkin'
And all these niggas in these magazines that keep on talkin'
Don't get twisted, I been there, I done that
But Ski's out control and maniac
He just show me that he got my back "I just show him I got your back"
See, in a lot of there, I'm straight
I'm Dr. Dre, but after stroke of mid night
I’m Mr. Ski A.K.A. Dooms Day
Concocted the shit up in my lab
With Mr. Ski up in my head, bringin' on the Aftermath
You can see the stars runnin' from the sky
Tryin' to get away from Dr. Dre and Mr. S-K-I

[Hook 2x]

[E-A-Ski] the Doctor should've told you, Mr. Ski is fatal to your health

[Dr. Dre] I'm livin' on another level that y'all ain't been yet

[E-A-Ski] the Doctor should've told you, Mr. Ski is fatal to your health

[Dr. Dre] yo, the life style that I'm livin' is just too complex

[Verse 2: E-A-Ski]
It's Mr. Ski and Dr. Dre, can't stop this maniacal individual
To start showin' level, with 7.0 on your digital
I'm tryin' to take over shit like Buddy-love
But this professor ain't nutty and he can't do it, any herpe dove
I was the madness that brought on Dre Day
Such this time Dr. Dre, he's the one is gonna pay
I dropped this bud, strain in his brain and shed it off
And have them slangin' guns to them females wouldn't set it off
I do dirt, and tied up his body and break free
Witnesses saw Dr. Dre but it was really Mr. Ski
You might think it's insane, but it's a clever scheme
Dre don't know shit, he wake up in the morning thinkin' it was a dream
Put his ass to sleep and soak his game up
Steady mobbin', hopin' to get this mothafucker brained up
I can't stop till I succeed, then I can break free
No longer Dr. Dre, nigga it's Mr. Ski

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
I start shakin'
Test tools and bottles start breakin' (*glass crush*)
My Ulti-Eagle starts overtakin'
Instantly spinnin' around like the mass
Tossin' that shit up off like a twister
No longer, the docter or Mister "Ski"
I can't hold it back
I'm trapped behind the walls of my brains, tryin' to count a rack
"even though tryin' to fight"
My vocal tone ignited into a loud scream "how high"
It's time to get the fuck up off, yeah

[Verse 4: E-A-Ski]
I’m on the loose like 2Pac from Juice
God bless the dead
But I'm already dead from trauma to the head
I'mma verbal Manslaughter on the Mic
Bumpin' in your trunk, shatterin' your glass from the street life
Nobody wants to play with me so I'm drillin' them
I'll be back like Swords nigga, so I can finish killin' them
If you want music to drive-By
Torment minds like yours and Dr. Dre
But all I think about is S-K-I

[Hook 2x]

[Outro: Mr. Ski]
(*exaggerate chuckles*)

[Hook: Royce Da 5'9"]
I might make it look easy
Thats just the way I be pimpin
Makin my money
Thats just the way I be pimpin
They wouldn't leave me
Thats just the way I be pimpin
You might not believe me
Thats just the way I be pimpin

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I'm livin a motion picture
Me and my niggas, and 16 bars
Will make the big screen ours
What is this? Everybody's jiggy now
Is the hustle that good in
Everybody's city now? Or do they act good?
I pimp on the street, I pimp in my sleep
And when I snore it sounds like
I'm sayin "Wheres my money?"
I ain't playin, I'm out there
Like, "Wheres my honies?"
You gotta be a pimp to understand
Just how I'm layin
Fuck a Lex Bubble, I'm rich
And after this
I'mma be rich all over again, except double
See, you ain't so hard if you ain't burnin rubber
In somethin with numbers after the dot, you ain't no star
Me and my whole crew, did either shot a nigga
Or been shot, and if you chuck us out, ain't no scars
Hint: steppin to me is suicide
And that basically means that you can die
True superfly

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
My lifes in the fast lane
Thats when I knew I had game
When class came I had hoes
But didn't know they last name
In school, when you niggas was tradin clothes
Me and my niggas was tradin hoes
Like "What they fadin fo'?"
Carry my books you ho
I had 'em slavin, yo
I get scarred then I played the ho
Like "Way to go"
Controllin the halls
Holdin a black Mack-11
Under the black leather
Platforms, a hat with a feather
I was so naughty, drivin a gold Audi
All we did was throw parties
And show up with Gold Gotti
Handsome, endsome, I'm the one you ran from
Cuz you could only be the man in the shit
That I was banned from
Make this shit seem easy
Fiends need me
Make the most conceited chick
In this bitch seem sleazy
Pleased at what I'm doin
And to all yall pimp niggas
Pimp on, and I'll see yall at the reunion

[Hook]

Clockin all the riches
Got the hollow points for the snitches

Swing down, sweet chariot stop and, let me ride

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Just another motherfuckin' day for Dre
So I begin like this
No medallions, dreadlocks, or black fists
It's just that gangster glare
With gangsta raps, that gangsta shit
Makes a gangs of snaps
Uh, word to the motherfuckin' streets
And word to these hyped ass lyrics and dope beats
That I hit ya with, that I get ya with
As I groove in my 'fo on D's
Hittin' the switches
Bitches relax while I get my proper swerve on
Bumpin' like a motherfucker ready to get my serve on
But before I hit the dope spot
I gotta get the chronic, the Remy Martin and my soda pop
Now I'm smellin' like indo-nesia
Bus stop full of fly bitches and skeezers
On my dick cuz my '4 on hit
Pancake front and back, side to side
And all that shit
So when I crawl I comes correct
Now, if your bitch in my shit, it's your bitch you check nigga
Now let the Chevrolet slide
As I dip and make a trip to the south side
Yeah

[Pre-Hook 2: Snoop Dogg]
Right back up in you it's the D-R-E
Witta ounce as we bounce through the CPT
Diamond in the back,  danas on the wheels
This is strictly for my bitches, now we're hittin in switches
Niggas gettin jealous cause' hoes be on our dick
But Dre don't give a fuck and I don't give a shit
So the '4 won't blow
Stoppin by the spot to get some indo

[Dre]
With all the motherfuckin' bitches sayin'...

[Hook: Jewell, George Clinton]

Swing down, sweet chariot stop and, let me ride
(Check this out...)

[Verse 3: Dat Nigga Daz]
Now as I roll with my nigga Dre and Eastwood
Still clocking dough in 93 and 94, fuck a hoe
We blaze up the zig zags back to back
With the orange chronic bud blazing sack to sack
Humpin, and bumpin that Doggystyle
On the eastside of the beach with the boomin sounds
Got my drink on deck, got the strap and if the spot is feeling hot
Then feel the fire with my gin on rocks, it don’t stop
Like I told you so, now let a nigga talk and flow, talk for riches
That way to get gold on gold on the black Liz-zac Coupe DeVille
Hydraulics and all that gangsta shit, so
On and on and you know it dont stop, put it in motion and let it roll On 3 and pose like a pimp
And hit em up with the pound, relax and sip up on the drink and smoke with everybody sayin…..

[Hook: Jewell, George Clinton]
Swing down, sweet chariot stop and, let me ride

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I got mo' class than most of 'em, ran with the best of 'em
Forgave the less of 'em and blazed at the rest of 'em
What can I say? Cali-for-ni-a
Where niggas die every day over some shit they say
Disconnected from the streets forever
As long as I got a Beretta, nigga, I'm down for whateva
I roll with my shit off safety, for niggas that been hatin' me lately
And the bitches that wanna break me
If Cali blew up, I'd be in the Aftermath
Bumpin' gangsta rap shit, down to blast for cash
'Cause from Eazy-E, to D.O.C., to D.P.G
Started from that S.O.B., D.R.E
Like Dub-C, I'm rich rollin', pistol holdin'
Pockets swole nigga, that's how I'm rollin'
Put the flame to the killer, nigga
Worldwide homicide mob figure in the building, for real
I'm hittin' switches, makin' bitches eat bitches
See me grab my dick every time I pose for pictures
I own acres, floor seats watchin' the Lakers
I'm cool with eses who got AK's in cases

[Chorus: Hittman]
Dedicated to all of those with big egos
Never fakin', we get the dough and live legal
Haters hate this, we sip the Mo' and yank the Heezos
Niggas play this in their Rovers, Jeeps and Regals
Dedicated to all of those with big egos
Never fakin', we get the dough and live legal
Haters hate this, we sip the Mo' and yank the Heezos
Bitches play this in their Benzes, Jeeps and Geos

[Verse 2: Hittman]
I'll bust a Mr. Toughy, slash a Smoovy Doovy
Crashin' Flex on Tuesdays, harassin' hoes at movies
Passin' by with Uzis, like who you aiming at?
That shady bitch and that bitch nigga that was claimin' that
Rat-a-tat-tat
*Automatic gunfire, screaming, followed by tires peeling*
I don't sympathize for wack hoes and wimpy guys
You gotta recognize Hittman is an enterprise
Cali pride, Bronson rider South Central-ised
The Henny got me energized, smoke the guys
Tryna focus on mines, poke they eyes out, I'm L.A.'s loc'est
Hope they don't have to find out the hard way
Like snitch niggas in the pen that get hit
When the guards look the other way
We hittin' hard – Hittman and Dre
You playin' games? I suggest you know the rules
We puttin' guns to fools, make you run yo jewels
Take yo honey and cruise to the Snooty & snooze, cop booze
Pop coochie 'til the nut oozes, you shouldn't fuck with crews
That's sick, the aftermath is we rule shit
I'm Big Hitt, don't confuse me with no other
'Bout to blow, motherfucker

[Chorus: Hittman]
Dedicated to all of those with big egos
Never fakin', we get the dough and live legal
Haters hate this, we sip the Mo' and yank the Heezos
Niggas play this in their Rovers, Jeeps and Regals
Dedicated to all of those with big egos
Never fakin', we get the dough and live legal
Haters hate this, we sip the Mo' and yank the Heezos
Bitches play this in their Benzes, Jeeps and Geos

[Outro: Hittman]
You look like AC Green, bitch, don't call here anymore
With feet like Ben Vereen's, bitch, don't call here anymore
No no, no no
What up? It's Hittman
I ain't at the crib right now
So you can leave your name and number after the beep
Unless it's Tammie's ugly ass – I ain't fuckin' with you

[Verse: Eddie Griffin]
Aww they say uhh..
.. a black man is a pimp
Well let me tell you the biggest pimp
On planet motherfuckin Earth, is her momma
It's her MOMMA that told her
"Get a man that got a good job gurl!
Make sure he got a good car gurl!
Make sure he can take you out and buy you somethin gurl!"
What happened to just fallin in love with a nigga with a bus pass --
-- just cause you love the nigga?
But I'm the pimp motherfucker!
I gotta be the player!
Biggest hoes, on planet Earth..
.. are walkin through the motherfuckin neighborhood
You KNEW when you got with the nigga he already had a woman
You knew he already had a family
But you fucked him anyway!!!
And then when you thought you gon' lose the nigga
You went and got pregnant - didn't you bitch, DIDN'T YOU!!
THE OL' KEEP A NIGGA BABY
And then when the nigga ain't around, what do you tell the child?
"Aww that nigga ain't shit, that's why yo' daddy ain't here;
Cause that nigga ain't shit."
How bout bein a woman, and tellin the kid the truth
That yo' momma, you was a ho!
TELL THE KID!
Momma was a ho, I was weekend pussy
I had you to keep the nigga, it didn't work out
That's why he ain't here - but he a good nigga
Cause he take care of his REAL family
I was just a dumb bitch, tryin to keep, a nigga that I wanted

[Dr. Dre] (Snoop Dogg)
As the wheels turn city to city, hundred-spoke
Chronic smoke, twist up another Phillie (Done dilly)
(Them niggas still trippin' off that old shit) Really? (How silly)
It's a whole nother day (Yeah it is)
Snoop Dogg (and Doc Motherfuckin' Dre) Nigga can ya feel this?
(It's the D-O-double, ya don't run up ya won't see no trouble)
If you caught up in these fuckin' streets
(Who you gon' call when them niggas gettin' ready to blast?)
Yeah, and if that shit's gettin' ugly
(Who you gon' call when them niggas come to get in ya ass?)

[Snoop Dogg]
I came to get in that ass, Bigg Di-Dogg, push the big hid-ogg
You're hoppin' and poppin', how bout you hop up off my bid-alls
Got dirt on my pid-aws, I broke a few lid-aws
It really don't matter cause I'm only here to spit on
And get on and shit on niggas
Do it to 'em D-O-double, right on nigga
I'm saggin' it, baggin' it, slangin' dubs
You motherfuckers think The Wash is all soap and suds?
What's up cuz?

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
If you tryin' to get a dub sack page me
The hoes say "Dee Loc, you so crazy"
Poppin' that shit don't faze me
I need my chips and the dip, it's like gravy

[Dr. Dre]
Now back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is expected and I'm feelin' that demand
Los Ang', broad day gunnin'
That ain't no earthquake it's just Dre comin'
If this shit ain't played the party ain't bumpin'
If I don't show up the hoes ain't fuckin'
(Real talk) Cali sunshine, come visit
Just don't stop at stop signs with bullet holes in it
All-Star League, you ridin benches
I handles my business, FUCK fake niggas
I sell game a quarter million a track
Snoop and the Good Doc back with a brand-new sack
Shit's wrong, money gone, I'll blast
Out of town, out of bounds, no pass
Runnin' up, talkin' shit, get smashed
(Shoot first) Ask questions last

[Snoop Dogg]
Fallin' back on that ass
Hit the switch and let the ass just drag
2001 & 2002 tags
My nigga what you holdin'?
Step out with the Stacey's and the Snoop Dogg Clothin'
Rollin', with the braids in my hair
Cripped out, way pimped out, oh yeah
You gots to pay the cost to be the boss
After all that dirt I gots to get my shit washed
The Wash
The Wash

[Intro: Dr. Dre]
This one is for my brother, Tyree, R.I.P
A message to God

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Since you finishing em early, what possessed you to start him?
We made a vow - later we'll regret til death do us part
Lord, I thought we was made for each other
You shouldn't connect those, made to be taken away from each other
Now what I'm supposed to do? I'm only half the man that I was
I'll never last, cause my better half is up there with you
You knew what you was doing when you made us, so with all due respect
You coulda forgave him, you didn't have to take him
He can take the game with him, cause he defines the word
The one who puts the G in it, who you think put me in it?
I'm feeling like my whole world is blinded, wondering why
Crying, pouring out my heart, pouring out liquor behind it
We fought like brothers, something we never should do
We coulda used time spent arguing telling the truth
He had talent too - I had plans on watching him blow
Don't know what hurts more, seeing him leave, or watching him go

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
Listen, listen, listen (Listen)
Listen, listen, listen (Better listen)
Listen, listen, listen

[Post-Hook: Rell & Mary J. Blige]
If you wan' know why (Why I live my life)
The way that I do (Cause I got to get this money)
So don't worry about me (Cause I know my way around)
I'm just hustlin' everyday, runnin' this race, makin' this paper

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
You's a soldier, you're probably packing heat up there
Met up with homies from the street, and got deep up there
If you only knew the way I felt before they ruined the crew
I thought I learned from Eazy, now I'm going through it with you
We lost a thug, a son, and a father
I spoke to your son, the other day, and told him Uncle Dre got him
The Lord must be accidentally pulling your file
Cause I'm still paging you, 911, straight in denial
Prayin' you get it, but no man can choose the card he was dealt
You either quit, or you gon' play it like you get it
I done been through all emotions, from in shock, to keeping a poker face
To straight breaking down and showing all emotions
I'm anxious to believing real G's don't cry
If that's the truth, then I'm realizing I ain't no gangsta
It's just not me, but you know I'mma always ride wit you
I miss you, sometimes I wish I just died with you

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
Listen, listen, listen (Listen)
Listen, listen, listen (Better listen)
Listen, listen, listen
Listen

[Post-Hook: Rell & Mary J. Blige]
If you wan' know why (Why I live my life)
The way that I do (Cause I got to get this money)
So don't worry about me (Don't worry, don't worry)
I'm just hustlin' everyday, runnin' this race, makin' this paper

[Outro: Mary J. Blige]
Listen
If you don't know why I you gotta listen up right now
Listen, listen, listen, listen
Listen, listen
Listen, listen, children, listen
I'm tryin to tell you somethin' good
Don't get caught up in the hood, yeah
If you don't know why
You gotta find out the reason why
Brother, brother

[Skit]
Oh, you're Doctor Dre. Ha-ha, are you a real doctor dude? I mean like, you know, can you prescribe some drugs for me man? Come on dude, I'll split whatever I get with ya, okay? Hahahaha
Ah, the chronic

[Intro]

Somebody here gon' fuck
All these niggas and all these hoes in here
Somebody here gon' fuck
All these niggas and all these hoes in here
Somebody here gon' fuck
All these niggas and all these hoes in here
Somebody here gon' fuck

[Verse 1: Hittman]
Talking that, walking that, spittin' at hoes
Smoking this, drinking that, gettin' at hoes
Fuck this I'm hitting that I'm hitting em both
Have one riding dick, one licking my toes
When I'm loving these hoes there ain't no love involved
No hugs, no kisses, bear rugs, bare britches
Rare bitches like them hoes in them Black Tail pictures
Bitch jumped off my dick
(Is that Dre over there?)

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Yeah, I just took some Ecstasy
Ain't no telling what the side effects could be
All these fine bitches equal sex to me
Plus I got this bad bitch laying next to me
No doubt, sat back on the couch
Pants down, rubber on, set to turn that ass out
Laid the bitch out, then I put it in her mouth
Pulled out, nutted on a towel and passed out

[Hook: Kurupt]
Come on let's get high (high)
Let's get high (high)
Come on let's get high (high)
Let's get high, all my ladies
Let's get high (high)
High (high)
Let's get high (high)
Come on let's get high

[Verse 3: Kurupt]
I make the four hop
Pull up at the spot
Weed by the barrels in my G'd up apparel
Stomping in the party
Kurupt, Young Gotti
I'm fucking something in this bitch
Hit 'em with some gangsta shit
Put something in your mouth bitch real tasty
I'm looking real saucy in my gangsta-ass Stacys
Hit the party, ease up, Kurupt with an ounce an'
Got all the hoes in this motherfucker bouncing
Bouncing

[Interlude]
Yo, whattup, Scruncho?
Mel-Man. what's cracking?
Wassup wit all these ol' punk ass hoes in here?

[Verse 4: Ms. Roq]
Nigga what, I'm a hustling bitch
I like them get rich niggas
Them hit the switch niggas
Niggas bout the sex and which bitch to hit next
While I'm kicking my game and collecting them checks
Got all y'all niggas vexed to fuck this triple-X rated ho
You say you ain't eat it, you ate it though
And uh, Roq don't stop, can't be dropping no drawers
To the niggas how you figure got you shitting in yours
Yeah, little dicks always running they mouth
While a bitch is better off to masturbate and be out
All you bitches up in here know what I'm talkin about
Get the loot, get the ice, fuck the wife, no doubt
Trying to live lavy, marry a big dick and stay cavi
Holla back at them niggas that hollered at me
Pop the Cris'
Whip the six and shit
And have all y'all niggas limp when I twist my shit

[Outro: Ms. Roq]
Yeah, bitch ass niggas

[Verse 1: Hittman]
When darkness be closin' in
I motivate, with the howlin' wind
With a list of chosen men, frozen in sin
Knowin' that your end is beginnin', swift silent and deadly
There's no defending my plots, I know your every movement
For six months I watch
Could've got you at your baby's mother's house
Even at your down-low weed spot
But the backdrop, wasn't flattering enough
I didn't want people gathering and stuff ​
Snapshots of blood splattering from the snuff
Here - puff this cig, while I figure which way, to split yo' wig
Right now you as nervous, as a Farmer John pig
As I dig into my tragic bag, take out the HK
Twist on the silencer, insert the 30 shot mag ​
Bullet stuck to his brain like a magnet
Skull in fragments, I leave the cleanup to Dragnet

[Hook: Hittman]
This is anybody (Murderer)
To fuckin everybody (Murderer)
Nigga all y'all (Murderer)
Uh, uh, for real, you'll fuck around and get killed
This is anybody (Murderer)
Motherfuckin everybody (Murderer)
Yeah nigga all y'all (Murderer)
Uh, uh, for real, you'll fuck around and get killed

[Verse 2: Ms. Roq]
Peeped all the stash drop and exchange of the dough
Lurkin through the turf, thinkin' how much it's worth
Give 'em chase to the crib and yo he properly laced
Stepped out the car, put my steel, to the side of his face
Murder is the fuckin Case, rob this nigga and shake
The fuckin spot cause in a few it's gon' be crawlin with cops!
Who's the bad bitch now, you crept on, paid the piper
Who'd've thought a sexy bitch could be a murderous sniper
Detrimental to your health, should've learned yo' lesson
But it's too late nigga bye-bye, better count yo' blessings
I been watchin you watchin me, yeah you ballin
Was, nigga now you finger fucked and steady fallin
A thug wit no love, but bitch niggas die fast
Thug niggas die young - oh what you thought you would last?
Blast two shots to the dome, slide back to the pad
And jack my nigga off, til his dick get soft
Resume the wifey boo shit, cause yo my man don't know
That his bitch is straight ill, servin ass with po'-po'

[Hook: Ms. Roq]
I'm a motherfuckin (Murderer)
Bitch this is anybody (Murderer)
Yeah nigga all y'all (Murderer)
Uh, uh, for real, you'll fuck around and get killed
I'm a motherfuckin (Murderer)
Uhh bitch this is anybody (Murderer)
Yeah nigga all y'all (Murderer)
Uh, uh, for real, you'll fuck around and get killed!

[Intro: Drake]
I do this for ya'll man
Malice, Nickelus F, it's the REMIX!

[Verse 1: No Malice]
Lights slow motion, steppin' out the Phantom
All eyes on me, peekin' and glancin'
Leanin' on the wall, with b-boys dancin'
Ears, neck, and wrists lookin' like the king's ransom
One chick, each arm, makin' it a tandem
Flat here costing' like fifty grand standard
Bottles poppin', cars wit' options
We livin' like kings, homie, you just watchin'
And I'm a show for ya, marble flo' for ya
And that thing in the driveway, came with the spoiler
I ain't bluffin', cop jewels off the Russian
Diamonds in the Jesus, look like he's blushin'
Miami breezes, we cross seasons
Escaped indictments, thank you Jesus
Y'all haters ain't even got a clue
While we get this paper, and that's how we do

[Bridge]
R-E U-P G-A-N-G
R-E U-P G-A-N-G

[Chorus: Drake]
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

[Verse 2: Drake]
Check, the verses I'm writing you might wanna learn it
You hatin my song but your wife wanna burn it
So now you at the store for some blank CDs
You can't see me, for your sake might wanna return it
Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl, she'll forget you
And I'll be the only one she concerned with
To the people that ignored me before this
This one is for you as a song re-recorded
Funny thing is, you just noticed me now but I was here all along
Your vision's just been distorted
I'm so throwed I live this, you ask me what the business
And I write a sixteen and report it
The waiting is over I think music need it
Drake cuttin his records without gettin weeded
People in the South want it chopped and screwed, I got this dude
They expectations I'mma exceed it
Like a singer with only backgrounds ya'll record it
When it's done ya lyrics tend to mislead ish
Finally here I'mma star with the timing
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclining
This for anybody that's searchin for cash, and purchasing fast
You only get the dough when you grindin
And so I grind like I'm listening to I Wayne
My pain, you can experience through the rhyming, boy!

[Chorus: Drake]
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

[Verse 3: Nickelus F]
Ugh, do what you do and I does what I does
These chicks love me, they say boy, you’re clean-cut for a thug
You should see the stampede when we rush in the club
It’s like a offensive foul how they running to us
Charge all their drinks on that platinum card
Lord I got ‘em hooked like the back of a bra
Ugh man, I am, like Sam, I am
I get the green, plus the eggs and ham
And a pen for any beef trying to approach us
Let the sucker burn, I don’t even flip 'em over
Nickelus F. teamed with Drake, now you mad as hell
Ain’t seen a better looking union since Gabrielle
Well, I'm hot as hell and I don’t even need a stylist
Spit the infernal like the Real World Challenge
V.A., Nickelus F., push your mileage
You’re running up our animals like white boys, they cow-tip
Everybody knows Cap from the south of Wallis
I ain’t gotta use a fist, slap you with the chalice

[Chorus: Drake]
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My people they chill, why you haters wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you haters want it all
You waiting for the Spring, and I'm gettin it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

[Intro]
Aww man
Ho! Yes!
Hahaha
Yeah... Can y'all hear me out there?
It's a lovely night tonight ain't it?
Yeah I know
I know what they thinkin' they ain't heard the beat they aleady scared
You know how I get down
But look I'm just gon keep it real

[Verse 1: Drake]
I'd like to know if there is a chemical
Imbalance in your makeup
Yeah
(Gotta be something wrong with you baby)
Sometimes I wonder... wonder if you plan
Half of this shit before I wake up
(Ohh Yeah)
Callin my ex-girl or e-mailin my mama (Damn)
You're the only one
That's causin me this drama
And then expect favors (Yea)
When you come in town
And I know if I see you guaranteed it's goin down

[Hook]
Cause
Too stay with this girl (Ho!)
You couldn't pay me!
I respect a woman
But this bitch is crazy (Hahaha)
This bitch is crazy (Yea)
This bitch is crazy
I respect a woman (I do)
But this bitch is crazy

[Outro]
She don't even know
That's the craziest part right?
She just oblivious to the whole shit like
And you know like I was sayin sometimes
I gotta get my R&B on you know
I wanna wear the wife beaters
With the slit at the top so
I can tear it easy and all that
I wanna sing in the rain girl
You know what I'm talkin bout
Yea
I need a R&B name too like uh... like uh... like
I don't know I'll think of it
Hey!
Hahaha
You crazy man for real
Ho!
Oh well nigga fall back ho!
Goddamn
I said it without sayin' it man

[Chorus: Dwele & Drake]
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
Why are you trying to be my girl? (Yeah)
I can't believe it (I know you got a man)
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
It's all right with me, my girl
We can do anything (Kick it to you like this)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Why you over there looking at me
While your man standing right beside you?
The temporary happiness he might provide you
But you know and I know that nobody gon' do you like me
Tryna save you like a goalie in line-of-sight
I know that I feel her, but slowly, I'm kinda like
I don't really wanna hit this girl
And still, she want this chap's stick like Napoleon Dynamite
Well, I'ma give it to you, honeybunches
You feel it all under your ribs like some tummy crunches
All my other girls all up on that subtle shit
They don't wanna cut it, they want a rapper to cuddle with
Consequences keep weighin me down
So whenever she thinks I'm serious, I'm playing around
It gets deeper and colder, the funny thing is
I'm writing this in my head as she asleep on my shoulder, like...

[Chorus: Dwele]
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
Why are you trying to be my girl?
I can't believe it
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
It's all right with me, my girl
We can do anything

[Verse 2: Big Pooh]
Look, we had a lil' thing, a wintertime fling
You some getback for your man mistreating
But that was then, you know, some hush-hush
I ain't never really see a future in us
Plus, your man still there, let's be fair
You'd do the same things to me
My feelings never did go past some late-nigh- smash
I'on't wanna take the place of he
Late nights, 85 South on my way to the crib
And somebody got a song for me
I already know what you about, 'cause I been the other man
And you not gonna trap me with your silly lil' plan
It's my bad, should've chose a wo-man
But I'm in the mix with this lil' girl, playing
I'm saying, you need to do what you do
I'm not tryna take it any further with you, c'mon

[Chorus: Dwele]
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
Why are you trying to be my girl?
I can't believe it
Don't you have a man?
It's all right with me, my girl
We can do anything

[Verse 3: Phonte]
Ugh, ugh, I met her at the bar, sipping on Patrón
And now, it's been three years off and on
'Cause the same page, we are rarely often on
'Cause when I'm in, she out, and when she in, I'm gone (C'mon)
We lost contact like Bausch & Lomb
But regained it while she was building a house and home
Wit this new cat, sayin that he doin her right
It just proves that she don't know what to do with her life
'Cause if so, she wouldn't have to change her strategy
And wouldn't need me to recharge her batteries
One minute, she mad at me; next minute, it's all good
And I'm in her body like "Gray's Anatomy"
I don't understand why God sent me to you
And I cain't try to justify that foul shit we do (Ugh)
All I know is that each time I'm stickin you
I think to myself, "Damn, if only her nigga knew," but...
(Hahaha, yeah)

[Chorus: Dwele]
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
Why are you trying to be my girl?
I can't believe it
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
It's all right with me, my girl
We can do anything
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
Why are you trying to be my girl?
I can't believe it
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
It's all right with me, my girl
We can do anything, baby

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, look

[Verse 1: Drake]
Me and Sos, we from two different walks of life
Mutually we understand there's a problem, we don't talk to vice
The watch is yellowy-green
That's sum awkward ice
I never signed for a mill' but been offered twice
I'm awful nice, lyrics that I often write
Inspire no-talent rappers to get off the mic
And I could pick you up from work when you get off tonight
Drop you at the house soon as you get off the pipe, man
I flow so cool like autumn nights
When I body this, tell me if the coffin's light
But don't try and tell me that a dolphin's white
Mislead Drake, that is not at all polite
It's a shame cause that's how the biz goes
Imagine if these other niggas flop and his blows
Bet I get a co-sign somethin' like no time
They'll be tryna sub a nigga in like Quizno's

[Chorus: Richie Sosa & Drake]
All I need is some weight, my scale, some money for bail
A lil' booth at the club for the whole cartel
Nigga my drink, my smoke, a bird on E
And somethin' heavy on my waist man, I'm easy to please
I need my moms, my pa, a bottle of cliqua
The whole ATF you know who we are
My women, my money, and leave me the keys
Of somethin fast and I'm good man I'm easy to please

[Verse 2: Richie Sosa]
I never lived in a fancy house
I grew up where the guns pop and the child molesters pulled the candy out
So I never really had a chance to escape
Fast forward to '07, ain't nothin' much changed
The D still scope the crip
And the mics ain't really that much bigger than the roaches is
And told the same damn sad story, different publishin'
D boys jugglin', single mother strugglin'
The media try to cover it
But the Cottonelle two-ply in your neighbor's house, I'm on some other shit
Me and Drake from two different walks of life
But both understand the pressure from the sharks that bite
My left arm's like David Wells
My right arm's like Holliday, so I'm probably lookin' at 8 to 12
For just tossin' one of my close friends a bag of chips
Shit, I know they want me locked up

[Chorus: Richie Sosa & Drake]
All I need is some weight, my scale, some money for bail
A lil' booth at the club for the whole cartel
Nigga my drink, my smoke, a bird on E
And somethin' heavy on my waist man, I'm easy to please
I need my moms, my pa, a bottle of cliqua
The whole ATF you know who we are
My women, my money, and leave me the keys
Of somethin fast and I'm good man I'm easy to please

[Intro: Trey Songz]
I can't stop missing you, wish I was still with you
I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no
I can't stop missing you, wish I was still with you
I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no

[Verse 1: Drake]
Nah
I never needed advice about
All the things you liked to do when it was lights out
I drove nice cars, I got a nice house
But now I'm steady missing you like a strikeout
I always wished I would've cared more
That's my only feeling inside whenever I get a song done
I'm scared that every girl I care for
Will find a better man and end up happier in the long run
Ya, and when she not by my side
And I hear that she gone
Now it's like a shock to my pride
I don't care if she know
'Cause that's basically just a male ego
Speaking aloud to some real people
But you can bounce back
Go ladies
More records, more sex, more babies
Yeah, wanna grant one of my wishes
Tired missing you, I'm tryna make you a missus

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
I miss the way you kiss
I miss the way you wear them heels and make it switch
Miss the way ya hair blows in the wind
And I miss you staying here till the morning
Miss the way you put on your makeup
Miss the way you love me too much
It's everything about you baby
Wanna know where you been lately
Do you go out? Do you still live at your old house?
Do you got somebody new in your life?
'Cause I can't get you outta my mind

[Bridge: Trey Songz]
And I wanna erase but I can't stop seeing your face
And every girl I try to replace you with
Why can't I get over it?
Simply 'cause I can't

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I can't stop missing you (Can't Stop)
Wish I was still with you (With you)
I can't stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop missing you (Can't stop)
Wish I was still with you (With you)
I can't stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop

[Verse 3: Trey Songz]
Missin' everything you say
Missin' all the crazy love we made
Why'd you throw it all away?
I want you to know it's been hell tryna do this without you here
Baby '07 supposed to be our year
You confront my worst fears
And I had my doubts every time you was going out
'Cause I knew you were tellin' me lies
And I can't get that outta my mind

[Bridge: Trey Songz]
And I wanna erase but I can't stop seeing your face
And every girl I try to replace you with
Why can't I get over it?
Simply 'cause I can't

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
I can't stop missing you (Can't Stop)
Wish I was still with you (With you)
I can't stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop missing you (Can't stop)
Wish I was still with you (With you)
I can't stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop
I can't stop missing you (Can't Stop)
Wish I was still with you (With you)
I can't stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop missing you (Can't Stop)
Wish I was still with you (With you)
I can't stop missing you, no, no, no, no
I can't stop

[Outro: Trey Songz]
I can't stop, missing you
I can't stop, missing you
(I don't wanna stop) I can't stop missing you
(Baby) I can't stop missing you
No, no, no, no
I can't stop, missin' you

[Intro: Drake]
I've got it made thats what I'm talking about
Going down to the fashion store and get myself fitted out
Going down to the dealers buy myself a brand new car
So me and my lady can ride

[Verse 1: Drake]
Check, I wish y'all coulda seen me back in high school, backpack
Grey range black Ac'
Put a half a stack out just to get a stack back
Double that school dance, Fresh J's, new pants
Back when "fuck bitches, get money" was the new chant
It started out about a boy like Hugh Grant
Now I'm a young man doin things you can't
But you can't call me Champagne Charlie
I campaign hardly
My damn chain glitter ruby red
The type of shit that leave your hand stained scarlet
I live it, thought you knew this
I swear that we been through this
Your boyfriends future plans got 'em on todays to-do list
Cause he rollin wit more squares then you would find up on a rubix
Bingo, money ain't a thing ho
That prometh with that sprite and jolly rancher so flamingo
I ain't speaking in code real niggas they know the lingo
Cause when I'm in the spot it's popping like Christopher's single

[Chorus: Drake]
If ya'll don't like me then (you must hate money, money)
Guaranteed if you had it to spare you could probably comprehend I'm just sayin' man (you must hate money, money)
They be gettin' jealous when you paid, savin' everything they made, I keep thinkin' that (you must hate money, money)
Telling people my image is lame, and I'm whats wrong with the game, but I'm feelin' like (you must hate money, money)
Considering everywhere I go got couple grand to blow man you know

[Verse 2: Rich Boy]
Hey, I'm flyer then a motherfucker
Haters wanna see me dead like John Tucker(so)
I'm in that big boy 550 s-class
I hit the gas and watch them hoes waving through the glass
Pimp glass im riding new in 2008 (say what)
I hit them hoes and send em home, you take em on a date
That white gucci ticker let em know there's money here
I grip the grain and sit on seats thats made of cashmere
5 karats in my ear, you see them hoes jock?
Bitch theres a whole lota rocks up in this powder watch
I'm writin letters to the pen for my brother irving
Send him a picture of that drop with me in it swervin
Hotter than a bitch rock, Cooler than some ice cream
Gotta feed myself I'm up here living in a dream
My cadillac mean but my 88 a beast
If bein fly against the law bitch call the po-lice

[Chorus: Drake]
If ya'll don't like me then (you must hate money, money)
Guaranteed if you had it to spare you could probably comprehend I'm just sayin' man (you must hate money, money)
They be gettin' jealous when you paid, savin' everything they made, I keep thinkin' that (you must hate money, money)
Telling people my image is lame, and I'm whats wrong with the game, but I'm feelin' like (you must hate money, money)
Considering everywhere I go got couple grand to blow man you know

[Verse 3: Drake]
Stacks on deck, lac's mounted on D's
I dont trust you so make sure you count it all please
And once its all there, then that put me at ease
And these niggas just mad cause they account is on freeze
Baby pay attention please, I'm more coordinated then a dance team
Its my turn, my turn like advance green
My true religion is money, check out the pant seams
I got cash in my palm I call it hand cream
And I just want the paper
My momma trying to go to rome and I just wanna take her
Im tryin to figure what the los angle is like a laker
So I can be on beaches with my niggas in jamaica
I say 'baby get low', You just getting by
They hating cause my swagger at a all time high
Shit its a damn shame homie I dont even try
Get money mofo is all you hear me reply

[Chorus: Drake]
If ya'll don't like me then (you must hate money, money)
Guaranteed if you had it to spare you could probably comprehend I'm just sayin' man (you must hate money, money)
They be gettin' jealous when you paid, savin' everything they made, I keep thinkin' that (you must hate money, money)
Telling people my image is lame, and I'm whats wrong with the game, but I'm feelin' like (you must hate money, money)
Considering everywhere I go got couple grand to blow man you know

[Verse 1: Drake]
Me and you so crucial baby
And that champagne so fuchsia baby
I do things that you ain't use to baby
And take you back home to St. Lucia baby
When raindrops hit the tan roof its crazy
That's a metaphor, did I lose ya baby?
When you are wet and covered in sweat
I'll wipe ya ass down like Boosie baby
I love all my feedback
Tell me to give it to ya if you need that
Touch right there, whatever the speeds at
If it's over fast then I promise you will relapse
Forget what you guess that I'm on and who is in your past
I'm refreshing and grown
Just charge that cell that I message you on
And if you lets us girl, I'mma bring the dressing along
You hear that professional tone?
Half of that's ice and the rest is Patron
Show up on time for the class I'm teaching
Cause guaranteed I'mma bring a lesson along
And you just gotta bring the breastes along
Instead of holding out wondering what it coulda been
I confess this address to you
And I'm the post man looking for a slot I can put it in
With no New York number mom still upstairs
I'm two floors under but my room's sound proof
You so tempted to satisfy your urge so you don't wonder
Yeah
I know I told you before I'll grab that for ya like holding a door
'Cause mine's it Polo and yours is Vickie
And they just spread all over the floor like

[Bridge: Robin Thicke]
You feel so good
You smell so good
You feel so warm
Just like I knew you would
Can't let you go
Can't let you go
I can't let you go

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
You were late to school
I'm gonna have to see you after class
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you a lesson
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to straighten you right up
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you
Teach you
Someone's gonna have to teach you

[Verse 2: Robin Thicke]
You can call me professor
But baby, you broke the rules
You won't get the grade you want
Unless you stay after school
You work it off (work it off)
Baby I can give you extra credit (extra credit)
But there's something else
Girl, can I frisk you?
Search your body for
You look so guilty to me
If I make you nervous
It's 'cause you're hidin' WMD's
And I'm gonna sentence you
Baby, you can do your time on me
I can't let you go
I can't let you go

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
You were late to school
I'm gonna have to see you after class
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you a lesson
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to straighten you right up
You've been a bad girl
Someone's gonna have to teach you
Teach you
Someone's gonna have to teach you

[Outro: Robin Thicke]
Just for the moment
For tonight
Can I make you mine?
Is it me, is it mine?
Can I love you all my life?

[Intro: Trey Songz]
Yeah Man (Aye)
You already know what it is (Aye)
Trey called Trigga (Aye)
Aye man (Aye)
Show them why you rappin' homie (Aye)
Look

[Chorus: Drake & Trey Songz]
I ain't never been nothin' but a underdog
And I ain't gonna never let a nigga hold me under dog
Still ride in the drop
With my mind on the knot
You niggas never take what I got
For my underdog

[Verse 1: Trey Songz]
Just copped new shoes
Whip on two two's
Dick down you two
Throw it on YouTube
Tell me what you'd do
If I was to do you
Baby after one time
Sure to make you come back
Back like spinal, stack like dominoes
Catch me out in Mexico
Hasta mañana though, hasta la vista
Chest full of reefer
Rep for my set till the day I meet the Reaper
Petersburg veteran
USA resident
In USA Today it ain't a city I ain't never been
Scared I ain't never been
Yea I ain't never been
Nothing but a underdog
But I'm never under ya'll
Still keep it under there
Right by the underwear
Still in the hood yeah
I ain't talking outerwear
They be moving powder there
Which one of you out of there
Wanna get it
Cause I'm with it
Fuck ya'll, the underdog

[Chorus: Drake & Trey Songz]
I ain't never been nothin' but a underdog
And I ain't gonna never let a nigga hold me under dog
Still ride in the drop
With my mind on the knot
You niggas never take what I got
For my underdog

[Verse 2: Drake]
Said I got my city buzzin
You should take a trip and view it
Shout out to Mr.Rogers
Cuz he's supposed to chop and screw it
And my liscense just expired
So I got to go renew it
Cuz I just bought a truck
And I am dying to debut it
And naw it ain't a Buick
I never rendezvous it
I'm just in the 'Burg with Trigga
And I'm faded off the fluid
I made alot of money
Then I went ahead and blew it
Now I'm trying to make it back
So how the fuck you wanna do it
My nigga you better do it(Aye)...do it
I would say this here's a practice song
And lately I been out in Hollywood
Just acting wrong
What up to Jackie Long
I fuck with Jackie Long
I clown other dudes on the low
I like to laugh alone
I get my cash alone
That's why I shop alone
This here's my uncle's car
I drop it and the top is gone
Your skin looks like you bathe in magnesia and coppertone
And girl I heard your man a fed, don't bring that cop along
I'm running every single light
Ain't one I'm stopping on
This here's a classic jump
That big things are popping on
So baby wipe me down
I sell a watch and swap a home
I'm in this solo
No I do not have a chaperone
I'm in a proper zone
That's right the doctor's home
This here's my time
And I don't even think your clock is on
I am a trader
And I'm telling you my stock is grown
I run my city, got 'em open like the lock is gone
Keys out, I ain't talking white though
Baby what you be's 'bout
I mean for tonight hoe
If I break them trees out
Pull them Double D's out
So I can J Holiday that ass
Before I leave's out
Holla at me shawty

[Chorus: Drake & Trey Songz]
I ain't never been nothin' but a underdog
And I ain't gonna never let a nigga hold me under dog
Still ride in the drop
With my mind on the knot
You niggas never take what I got
For my underdog

[Verse 1: Drake]
Check (Nottz, Nottz, Nottz)
They ask me about this rapper chick I might know
I say I never hit it but we sure to try it right though
My verses smother beats and they are in need of some lipo
As for rappers, she is not my type, she's like a typo
Flow is universal, take a blood test, I'm type-O
Nottz do me a favor, turn the volume up, it's quite low
I write so, I might blow, my chain emits a white glow
See life is a scrimmage I am runnin' the ISO
What is about to unfold, no tellin' like a dice throw
Meet a lot of chicks so your girl is someone I might know
It's only if she's nice though, I ain't about the wife though
And let no, Uncle Ben's rice throw, that is just how my life go
And move faster than the leopard sprint
Around the world, got a lot of spots like leopard print
I used to think you play too much
But I'd rather go deaf than lose touch
Holla at me baby

[Chorus: Drake]
Look, been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my (new shit)
Let me give you my (new shit) (x6)
Then call me anytime, I'll bet you I'll be around

[Verse 2: Von Pea]
It's been a couple weeks out travelin' and this broad
I've seen a couple freaks out battlin' for discharge it's odd
I try to tell her I ain't seen a flier one
Denying some, I have desired some, but that time is done
Now I am gon' give it to you straight out of the bottle
No chaser, I've embraced one in lace, she was a model
Shorty jumped out of the closet even though I mean literal
Her girl made it figurative, or maybe that's what liquor do
Baby, that's the physical, maybe if we spend
A few days all alone on our throne I can get to you
I know you feelin' hittin' on the road is the typical
But I be in the telly, on your Myspace clickin' through
Your pictures, this bruh took a good game
But a fella couldn't Roc, I wanna Dash to my Dame
I'm sayin', I know I be playin' too much
But I'd rather go deaf than loose touch, holla at me

[Chorus: Drake]
Look, been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my (new shit)
Let me give you my (new shit) (x6)
Then call me anytime, I'll bet you I'll be around

[Verse 3: Phonte]
Round, round, round, round, round
Ayo, the same chick from "Don't you have a man?" "Well..."
It all blowed over like Manuel Noriega
She said she wouldn't marry the player
But she's the Tamia to his Grant Hill, man chill
I thought you was my damn seal
In distress, rescue you from the landfill
She said, "That ain't enough protection
I need +Affection+ like Lisa Stansfield
I guess I can't be mad at this thing that you got
I'll lace you up but I ain't tryin' to tie the knot, so ah
From me you won't hear no more questions
And please understand that you got my blessings
I hope that your new love opens doors
And is everything that you hopin' for
But you can't get my new shit, girl you spoken for

[Chorus: Drake]
Look, been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my (new shit)
Let me give you my (new shit) (x6)
Then call me anytime, I'll bet you I'll be around

[Verse 4: Drake]
Since you came into college, Hill is somethin you still TiVo
Then you switched the vibe and listened to Il Divo
Or maybe D.M.P., A Tribe Called Quest
But when you call too much then I call less
You would always complain about my small texts
But what you call conversation, I call stress
And that put a barrier between both of our carriers
And I would be like "I ain't getting service in your area"
You be like "Nigga get your bars up"
I just string you along like I was tuning guitars up
I know that I was wrong, I think that this is fate
You took out those extensions and lost you a little weight
Your booty lookin bigger and I think that shit is great
A fresh start is in order, let me take you on a date
Take you on a date
I used to think you used to play too much
But I'd rather go deaf than lose touch, holla at me baby! (look)

[Chorus: Drake]
Look, been a minute, I know my number outta service
Cause sometimes I don't really wanna be reached
Damn how things change in a year
Tell me how everything goin'
And I know someone told me you wanted to teach
Let me give you my (new shit)
Let me give you my (new shit) (x6)
Then call me anytime, I'll bet you I'll be around

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah
9th Wonder
Don't judge me, man
They tend to say that us rappers are materialistic
They say we lack substance
Me, 'Te and El 'bout to prove 'em wrong, though

[Chorus: Drake]
Ugh, we know what you're thinking, love
You think we out smoking and drinking, love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we early and be showing up extra late, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me

[Verse 1: Drake]
They don't be saying how I'm humble, I'm hella nice
Or that I've been approached to sign to Roc-A-Fella twice
They just tell you all the rumors they heard
And we laugh soon as you come and tell me like Amel and Bryce
My groove theory is that when you too cheery
They try to bring you down to the level they at
Well when they are all unhappy, then it gets a little sticky
That's why I am Little Nicky to these devils in rap
But, uh, they ain't thinking Drake get smart, girl
Nah, they probably think I'll break your heart, girl
Haha, I can't lie, you probably right about it
And if you give me the ass quick, I'll probably write about it
But I hate it when they judge me on how I sound
I mean I spit that influential shit from my town
I don't know why you sitting on the couch
When you see I got a bed, bring your ass here and lie down
You think taking your purse off
Will lead to me, you taking shirts off and then your skirt off
At least I got status because I could've been a local emcee
And you probably would've been worse off
So I'ma take this hat off, and I'ma hit it till I'm back soft
And then I backs off
'Cause you thinking you can predict what happen
You the reason I'm thinking I'm getting sick of rapping

[Chorus: Drake]
Ugh, we know what you're thinking, love
You think we out smoking and drinking, love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we early and be showing up extra late, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me

[Verse 2: Phonte]
You probably think I walk around with my gun tucked and
Swang dick to these hoes like nunchucks
Well, you can think what you want but
I think you've been watching too much BET: Uncut
You need to get real and check out my real life
I ain't a tip-drill, don't care what it smell like
But if you feel like putting all your notions aside
And talking to a real nigga, I'd gladly oblige
First name Phonte, I'd be pleased to date ya
College educated, got degrees in papers
But I'm from the South where if you ain't snapping
Or rapping 'bout trapping you's a freak of nature
Such an anomaly, speak so well
And talk so collegy, such an astonishing
Contrast to all the bullshit you've been following
On behalf of them, I offer my apologies
Maybe with me you'll unlearn
Putting all niggas in a box of concerns
Me, 'cause I ain't dumb, shit, I'm well-read like sunburn
And after me, you'll never leave no stone unturned

[Chorus: Drake]
Ugh, we know what you're thinking, love
You think we out smoking and drinking, love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we early and be showing up extra late, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me

[Verse 3: Elzhi]
Yeah, they say you never judge a book by its cover
Though you appear as materialistic, just like the others
So I followed your words to take 'em in
And I don't see what you saying, so they coming off paper-thin
That's when I felt that I would need to
Do more than just look you up and down
To see if I could read you
And try to get inside your head only
Not just stick my fingers in your middle
To get you to spread for me
So what I learned on my path to discover?
Your story took one ugly turn after another
I saw we wasn't on the same page
I would've gave you strong play
But your words rubbed me the wrong way
So now, I'm closing the case
You only out for the paperback, that's written all over your face
No, El will never judge a book by its cover
Until he seen what was in between and looked at what lies are under

[Chorus: Drake]
Ugh, we know what you're thinking, love
You think we out smoking and drinking, love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we early and be showing up extra late, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me

Oh you fancy huh
Oh you fancy huh
Oh you fancy huh
Oh you fancy huh
Nails done, hair done, every thing big
Nails done, hair done, everything big

[Verse 1: Drake]
You gettin' ready so I know we gon be here awhile
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spendin' hours in salons on your hairstyle
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym, step on the scales, stare at the number
You say you droppin' 10 pounds preparin' for summer
And you don’t do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself, you’re the fuckin' coldest
Intelligent too, ooh you’re my sweetheart
I’ve always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a little class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look, I really think that nobody does it better
I love the way you put it together

[Hook: Swizz Beatz x2]

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
She got it all together
She dont need to help none
She got her own paper
She dont need you to taker her
On a shopping spreee
My girl is fancy, fly and free
For some Gucci, huh
For some Louis huh
She got the best of everything
You can never report a fancy girl like me

[Hook: Swizz Beatz x2]

[Interlude: Drake]
Atlanta girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know that everything big
Nails done hair done, everything big
And my NY girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know that everything big
Nails done hair done, everything big
And my LA girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know everything big
Nails done hair done, everything big
And my TO girls, let me see your hands
Wave 'em at them bitches hating on you with their friends
Girl you got it, let 'em know everything big
Nails done hair done, nails done hair done
Say go Cinderella, go Cinderella
Orgasm blush, lipstick and concealer
Devil in a tight dress, girl you a killer
And ain't nobody realer, and ain't nobody realer, go

[Verse 3: Drake]
Uh, 5 and a half in boys, ass is off the hook
Cinderella 'bout to lose the glass off her foot
And when I find it is when I find you
And we can do the things we never got the time to
Better late than never but never late is better
They tell me time is money, well we’ll spend it together
I’m down for whatever, you just lead the way
We go to dinner you don’t even look at me to pay
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it I ain't never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
Yeah, but shout out to the homeowners
The girls that got diplomas and enough money to loan us
A little something extra, should we ever need it
If it sounds like you, then let me hear you repeat it

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]

I'm gon tell the people, that we locking this down

[Chrous: Voyce]
I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know
I don't deserve, all this Love (Loving me)
I can't believe that it's just really you and me, and I know
I can't contain myself, all this Love (Loving me)

[Verse 1: Voyce]
Girl, I've been thinking about the way, that you love me every day
And I want to know, if You Feel The Same Way
Because I'm in and out of town, that's just how I got's to get down
But you understand, that's why I'm your man

[Chrous: Voyce]
I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know
I don't deserve, All this Love (Loving me)
I can't believe that it's just really you and me, and I know

Yeah, yeah (Keep rocking to this beat)
Uh, uh, uh (You want me to drop to this beat?)
Uh, uh, uh (Ho!)
Yeah, yeah (Let me get a little gospel on them, yeah, Uh)

[Verse 2: Drake]
They say he wanted the bounce back
I can easily make them admit that the bounce back
Without knowing exactly where my accounts at
Yeah, you best believe
That I often tend to surpass what the rest achieve
So, they don't like me
They throw parties, and yet they never invite me
I can't lie, sometime it bother me slightly
Either way the true fans yell
I appear calm, and it's obvious of who can't tell
And no, this ain't Blu Cantrell
This is like perfection, though we both got the light complexion
Couple things I do damn well
And the way that I Jack son, you figure Drake knew Sam L
I'm for real though
I'm from Memphis, I'm often labeled as Trill so
They stay kicking it with me like a field goal
See I'm humble, but I live fame
For more deals on the table than abridge game, ah

[Chrous: Voyce]
I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know
I don't deserve, All this Love (Loving me)
I can't believe that it's just really you and me, and I know
I can't contain myself, All this Love (Loving me)

[Bridge: Voyce]
Even when the sun don't shine, I know you're my sunshine
And even if the sun outside, we can anything baby
I need to feel you next to me, You want to feel me next to you
We can do anything you want to do
Tell Me the Next Morn Baby!!!

[Chrous: Voyce]
I never dreamed that you would be so good to me and I know
I don't deserve, All this Love (Loving me)
I can't believe that it's just really you and me, and I know
I can't contain myself, All this Love (Loving me)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Now-a-days you sayin' that I should go Jermaine, I should go Pharrell
Either or my nigga, make sure you don't get shelled
(Right) Make sure your money's right and they do a promotion well
So you could get checks cut like Benedict in Ocean's Twelve
This ain't Brad Pitt, I gotta admit
I'm sick of seeing chicks in that Louis V and that Plaid shit, cause it's a bad fit
They say my father lives through me, so this is just basically how my dad spit
I know my cash come quick when it's sunny
You know a girl is special if I stick with her honey
If it wasn't for dummies chick would still have money
And if it wasn't for money Nick would still have Skummy
So, guess it's kinda like a gift and a curse
To jip money is easier than liftin' a purse
If you pick the wrong mother who'll snatch you, run for cover
A week later you might find ya click in a hearse, boy!

[Chorus: Drake]
I, take time arrange that (Money)
Some, kill just to claim that (Money)
Switch countries exchange that (Money)
You cannot get jack for free
And my, proceeds and cash right (Money)
There's, no need to stash right (Money)
Got the same, four G's from last night (Money)
You cannot take that from me, homie

[Verse 2: Nickelus F]
Money’s the reason my best friend got murdered
So with that and my amounts tryin to make it just to burn it
Milk the game, turn it to butter, look how I turned it
No chick shall get any of dis unless she earns it
Take that dick, put to your lips and insert it
Where the hell is self-respect go when them checks show?
You sleep with them anywhere, hell is your bed for?
You always on your back, what the hell is your legs for?
I know, walk that strip, get my grip
That new Benz’s comin out, put some 'umph' in your switch, trick
Plus I need rims, diamonds and gems
So get up, do the hand job, and some head for him
I got my mind on my money, and my money on your mind (Money)
I’ll blow your mind all over the money that’s on your mind (Money)
So keep my dough off your head, fuck with do on your head (Money)
Now you really got money on your mind, nigga

[Chorus: Drake]
I, take time arrange that (Money)
Some, kill just to claim that (Money), yeah
Switch countries exchange that (Money), uh
You cannot get jack for free
And my, proceeds and cash right, uh
There's, no need to stash right, right
Got the same, four G's from last night, uh
You cannot take that from me, homie

[Outro: Drake]
Southern Smoke

[Chorus: Drake]
Look, if you a girl with the aspirations
Of being in the background with your asses shakin'
Hittin' clubs and skippin' out on the class you takin'
I ask you to have some patience
(You're worth so much more)
To my dudes at the bar with a freak and
Steady lightin' cigars at the parties they sneak in
And look forward to being a star on the weekend
Ya'll part of the speech 'cause

[Verse 1: Drake]
I'm from the city where
People be gettin' lazy, litterin' in the streets
And the club district is poppin' like literally every week
And promoters'll push flyers, money exchange hands
Liars sell you they dreams and dummies exchange plans
Hustlers give you events, bouncers give you pass
Directors give em a shot, so girls'll give up the ass
And groupies that would flock to hometown athletes
And start rolling together like Snoopy and Woodstock
Daffy and Bugs, its all laughing and hugs
Til the dude catch a plane and she back where she was
Right back on the bus, it's a shame cause now
At his window she throwin' bricks like Shaq in the clutch
You can see that's shes colder 'cause he doesn't hold her
Fall flat on the ground trying ta lean on his shoulder
Know that he tried ta told her that he couldn't mold her
If this the type of chick you wanna be when you older, I say

[Chorus: Drake]
If you a girl with the aspirations
Of being in the background with your asses shakin'
Hittin' clubs and skippin' out on the class you takin'
I ask you to have some patience
(You're worth so much more)
To my dudes at the bar with a freak and
Steady lightin' cigars at the parties they sneak in
And look forward to being a star on the weekend
Ya'll part of the speech 'cause

[Verse 2: Drake]
Now up north there's five artists deservin' a listen
And I'm one of em, the other four you know who you are
But if you gotta think through chances are that it ain't you
I single-handedly carry out what you can't do
And see I take a couple of breathers
And then things come together on the spot like a couple that's eager
If you wanna pack a duffel and leave her
Go ahead, I couldn't give two damns like a couple of beavers
But uh, the in & the out and the plan's seeming ill
Whenever I'm out in Memphis the man seen as trill
And every verse the man seem to kill
You can find him with black jays and socks like I'm Andreena mill
Japan and Brazil, the audience screaming
And then you come around and all the fans seems to chill
Advances to deals, financing appeals
The hustles, I have you feeling like you dancing in heels and uh

[Chorus: Drake]
Look, if you a girl with the aspirations
Of being in the background with your asses shakin'
Hittin' clubs and skippin' out on the class you takin'
I ask you to have some patience
(You're worth so much more)
To my dudes at the bar with a freak and
Steady lightin' cigars at the parties they sneak in
And look forward to being a star on the weekend
Ya'll part of the speech 'cause

[Verse 1: Slakah]
Lady, you say I stay in the house til four
We don't even go out no more
Its always the same eh
Always complainin, it's obvious baby
I guess you don't watch the news
You see theres a lot to lose
Cuz we got a baby and people are shady

[Bridge: Drake]
My generation is changin
Aside from the fact
The dealers have customers they provide with the crack
Front of the buses taken
And we deny it from the back
You can die where you from, or die where you at

[Chorus: Drake]
Don't put it past them
I don't think that they understood
My friends they ain't even sit in the class when they should
He can come pick you up
If your dads in the hood
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good

[Verse 2: Slakah]
Lady, somebody shot up the place right by
Where I work and I think they might
Be coming for me next, klend me ya Kleenex
I'm tellin you baby
I think I'm a bout to cry
Still gotta go out tonight
Cuz I gotta feed you, I hope that I see you again
A-a-again
Hope that I see you, see you

[Chorus: Drake]
(Southern Smoke)
Don't put it past them
I don't think that they understood
My friends they ain't even sit in the class when they should
He can come pick you up
If your dads in the hood
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good

[Verse 3: Drake]
Lately I don't know about the friends that I hang with
I'm nervous round my boys, it depends on their anguish
Depends on if they saving all the tops on Pepsi
With dreams of seeing girls topless on jet skis
Depends on what they do to achieve that
Robbing r&b singers, 'specially if they know where the keys at
Specially if they know where they girl live
Get the info, leave with ya money man, thats how the world is
Thats how niggas puttin' they dirt down
Streets are seedy, I call em sesame
It's Ernie and Bert's town
'specially when these youngins get turned down for work opportunities
Next week same place'll get burnt down
Coincidink? not likely not a chance
How can we be so aware of these problems and not advance?
At least start put a bid in, its hard just to fit in
A lot of people only play they part when they spittin
But I don't think that they understood
They using this darkness for penetration in the hood
I took the ivory way in and yes I'm glad that keenan could
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good

[Outro]
Uh
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good

[Verse 1: Drake]
My name is Drizzy, and I ain't perfect
But I work hard, so I deserve it
And I belong, right where you see me
Ain't on the fence about it, I ain't Mr. Feeny
Nah, I got a decent set of manners
And a job that fills up any empty schedule or a planner
And I fall in love with girls caught up in superficial glamour
Who dress like Sarah Jessica and live like Princess Diana
So often they have addictions and I'm the one that'll feed it
But truly you're bad enough that y'all don't even really need it
You could show up at the party on dirty public transit
And I guarantee the cameraman will still be snappin' candids
Of you and your posse partyin', drinkin' what you get handed
With your Virgin Island tans, all lookin' like you just landed
I don't really understand it, I'm not sure I'm comprehendin'
But these girls are having fun with whoever's money they spendin', screamin'

[Chorus: Santigold]
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Ahem, my name is Weezy, I'm almost perfect
And I work harder than hard workin'
Bizarre circus, that's when my bars surface
Therefore I act a clown
Even when I'm layin' on my back I'm never backin' down
So over-stand me
I got a condo in Miami and my doormat is always sandy
And I run Louisiana, but I've never pulled a hammy
And I got a condo in Atlanta, and I always wear a bandana
And when it comes down to stuntin', you boys are just buntin'
And I'm swingin' for the fence, your girl hangin' from my dick
Your girl singin' to my shit, like, "a-la-la-lollipop"
She say I get that pussy wetter than a Dasani shop
And she say I freak that pussy better
Better than her gynecologist, ho just
Text me whenever you want some more dick
More dick, old bitch, young bitch
But I be like damn, all I got is one dick

[Chorus: Santigold]
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie

[Bridge: Santigold]
I got the talk, the beat and bass
Give me one, I'll take it, make you lose your place
Tell me I-I-I can play so I speed up the pace
I break it, break it you can't stop me in this ra-race

[Chorus: Santigold]
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
I got to be unstoppable
I got to be unstoppable
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie
Ay-ay-ay-ay, you don't lie

[Keith Murray]
Now Keith Murray's in a hurry quick fast
To get up in that ass with some ol' ill shit, and a paragraph
All y'all rappers comin with that happy-dappy
Scared to be nappy shit makes me wanna laugh
Believe me you I'll come through with a crew
That's sicker than the flu
You couldn't even take these niggas to the zoo
Cause when I rap competition perform disappearin acts
And I jam like Smuckers
My style is funky like a six-pack of motherfuckers
Murray emphasizes on rough poetry
With formality, with no sympathy
I'm on the MC killer streak like John Wayne Gacy
With the funk, which is essentional with my recipe
And I'm beatin Mother Nature down to her knees
By makin more papers than trees, niggas please - it's goin down
Chorus:

It's in her neighborhood
Nah you ain't gotta roll with me it's all good
I trust her dog
Aw nigga shut up nigga, I hear you, don't trip

Well the party didn't start til I walked in
And I probably won't leave until I finish this Henn'
But in between time or in the meantime
I slid my bitch in the back do' an she crept in with the nine
We came here together so we can have fun
Me and you baby goin one on one
It's yo' hood so I figure it's good
But if them niggas start trippin
I ain't trippin shit I ain't Hollywood
We handles ours from the all-stars to the handlebars
With buckshots comin from the homies in the cars
Aww yeah; how y'all wanna play this
Naw hold on let me see how should I say this
The bitch that I was wit tried to set me up
Whatever fuckin reason would they wanna wet me up
And get me up out the bitch wit da heat
And a party wit a gang of off brands and a freak (where you from)
I gotta dust em if I rush em
And these niggas don't look like they wanna tussle (fuck em)
I'mma creep to the who-ride - all by my lonely
Nigga didn't bring damn homie
I wish I woulda, but I didn't
I'm fuckin wit dis hood rat (bullshit ya bullshittin)
That's whats wrong wit niggas
Steady thinkin wit ya dick, and puttin faith in a bitch
Dogg is chillin, makin a killin
What more can I say? "Top Billin'"
Thats what I get, I got it good
Crackin bitches in ya hood bitch
Would you stop schemin, and lookin hard
I got a great big bodyguard
So step up if you wanna get hurt
Nigga mad cause I touched under his bitch skirt
I get the money, the money I got
Hoes call me Doggy when they feel real hot
That's how it is, ask yo' kids
I stole ya ho while you was in prison
Jail, for spousal assault
You was jealous it's all your fault
Dogg is chillin, makin a killin
What more can I say? "Top Billin'"
Shootin dice came up short now I'm doin bad
Lost the Coupe and the keys to the Caddy
So bad that I'm livin with my momma now
And my bitch done dipped cuz I done run outta chips
I lost my balla doe and my balla ho
Man to some sucka ass nigga man I'm fallin slow
Can't ain't even call a ho; I'm feelin smalla loc
Next thing to do is rob a ball of folks (give it up nigga)
Shit's real; we peel for the meal
Take it, cause once we get it, y'all come kick it
And bring them same skanless bitches (why?)
I got some homegirls layin low in the kitchen
On a mission to keep on dishin all fools
Doggy Dogg cold out shot us them hoes broke the rule
They gonna get got, feel the pain, sweeter and sweeter
Even bitches feel the heater motherfucker

[Speaking outro]

[Verse]
And in here is where the heroin boil
And I also got a large pot of cigarette oil
That's embalming fluid, illiterate are you?
That's ok man, I got the medicine for you
I got, I got, I got the amphetamine for you
Got that vitamin D-R-U-G for your shorty
One window to let the dawn in
'Cause we hustle in this bitch midnight to morning, yeah
We dump in and pump out
I showed you this window for you to jump out
You on the backyard lawn where a nigga got the ganja growin'
No cats or dogs, rats or snakes, Sams or Jakes
Around here it's all gravy, ham and steak
Mama cookin' that up, here have a plate
That's Mama Carter, she's a basket case
But I make sure her sandwich and napkins straight
You pick wit this picnic and I'm at your face, fucka!
I say I'm at your throat, this was Tha Carter, slam the door
Go!

[Intro]
Fuck with me
Thank you

You can't see me
But I see you (Yeah)
And I see you (Yeah)
Lord

[Verse 1]
Bring the crowd in, I'm loud in living color
It is Weezy Fuckin' Baby, got these rappers in my stomach
Yummy, I'm taking it, I ain't askin' them for nothing
If you sell a million records, we could battle for your money
I'd rather count a hundred thousand dollars on a Sunday
Watch a football game and bet it all on one play
Still stuntin', baby, yes, I'm still flossin'
Latest car on the market with the top peeled off it
Big wheels make it look a little bulky
You look a little salty, have yourself a chilled coffee
Chill out, the guns is still out
Even though I am a boss and got papers to fill out
I'm busy, I got paper to reel in
God, I hope they snappin' at the end of my rod
I hope I'm fishin' in the right pond
And I hope you catchin' on to every line, who am I?

[Chorus]
The best rapper alive (Huh, yep), the best rapper alive (Huh, yep)
The best rapper alive (Huh, yep), the best rapper alive (Huh)
Swagger right, check (Uh), game tight
And they gon' R-E-S-P-E-C-T me (Who?)
The best rapper alive (Huh, yep), the best rapper alive (Huh, yep)
The best rapper alive (Huh, yep), the best rapper alive (Huh)
Swagger right, check (Uh), game tight
And you should be afraid, be very afraid (Yeah), yeah

[Verse 2]
The heart of New Orleans, thumpin' and beatin'
Livin' and breathin', stealin' and feedin'
Peelin' and leavin', killin' and grievin'
Dearly departed, erased, deleted
No 'prints, no plates, no face, no trace
Out of sight, out of mind, no court, no case
Sell his chain, celebrate, block party, second line
Zulu Ball, Essence Fest, Jazz Fest, Mardi Gras
Shotty bounce, body rock, now he dropped, now he got
Family try tell the feds, tell the cops
Smell a rat comin' back to the house, to the spot
Tap-tap, knock-knock, who is that? Chk-pow
Triggaman, hoodie man, tell the kids Boogieman
Pistol Pete, Ammo Mammal, gunman, blum-blam (Haha)
Damn, Sammy, you done fucked up
Pussy-ass niggas, put your nuts up, just call me

[Chorus]
The best rapper alive (Huh, yep), the best rapper alive (Huh, yep)
The best rapper alive (Huh, yep), the best rapper alive (Huh)
Swagger right, check (Uh), game tight
And they gon' R-E-S-P-E-C-T me (Who?)
The best rapper alive (Huh, yep), the best rapper alive (Huh, yep)
The best rapper alive (Huh, yep), the best rapper alive (Huh)
Swagger right, check (Uh), game tight
And you should be afraid, be very afraid, yeah

[Verse 3]
Fuck up with all these rookie MCs?
Whew, smell like a bunch of pussy to me
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em good, fuck 'em long
Fuck 'em hard, fuck who? Fuck 'em all
Yeah, like that, just like that, right back
I'm on that money train and that MAC'll knock 'em off track
The quarterback, well-protected from the Warren Sapp
The young heart attack, I spit that cardiac
You can't see me, baby boy, you got that cataracts
I'm right here, straight out the hood just like an alley cat
Since everyone's a king, well, where the fuck your palace at?
Me? I got callous on my hands, I can handle that
It's no problem, baby, I so got 'em
It's just a victory lap, baby, I'm just joggin'
Yeah, and I ain't even out of breath
The motherfuckin' best yet, sorry for cussin' (Who?)

[Chorus]
The best rapper alive (Huh, yep), the best rapper alive (Huh, yep)
The best rapper alive (Huh, yep), the best rapper alive (Huh)
Swagger right, check (Uh), game tight
And they gon' R-E-S-P-E-C-T me (Who?)
The best rapper alive (Huh, yep), the best rapper alive (Huh, yep)
The best rapper alive (Huh, yep), the best rapper alive (Huh)
Swagger right, check (Uh), game tight
And you should be afraid, be very afraid, yeah

[Intro: Lil Wayne & Kurupt]
Yeah
Vibe with me, sweetheart
It ain't hard
Aww, fuck them niggas, I ain't worried 'bout them
This Cash Money, baby
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout? This Tha Carter II
Kurupt, holler at them niggas (Nigga)

[Chorus: Kurupt & Lil Wayne]
We won (Yeah), we won (Yeah)
And then we shot that BB gun (You know)
And they lost (Yeah), and they lost (That's right)
And we took they shit, now it's time to floss (Lock and load)
We won, we won (Yeah, it's Weezy Baby, man)
And then we shot that BB gun (See, you gotta be real smooth, real slick about this here)
And they lost, and they lost (Extra gentle, on the tender side)
And we took they shit, now it's time to floss (They like it that way, hah, lock and load)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne & Kurupt]
Twenty-two-year-old 17th Ward vet
Life in the fast lane, little red Corvette
Little red handkerchief hangin' out the right side
Back pocket jeans fallin', cover my Evisu sign
Yep, we do shine and they gon' hate
But they hated Jesus, baby, we won't break
So we ride like four Pirellis, so secured
No security, no protectin', no comparin'
Loc-in' heavy, Ocean 11
Aviators, vote-takers, so fakers, ah
No players, I'm Hollygrove to the heart
Hollygrove from the start, don't cross Earhart
Boulevard was the ward I come from
One-seven, one shot? Never that, blum-blum
Brr, brr, pop, pop, clap, clap
What the fuck, Hollygrove, stand up (Nigga), duck

[Chorus: Kurupt & Lil Wayne]
We won, we won
And then we shot that BB gun (Get low)
And they lost, and they lost
And we took they shit, now it's time to floss (Lock and load)
We won, we won
And then we shot that BB gun (Yeah, me and my nigga Maine is in here smokin' and laughin' at you cats)
And they lost, and they lost
And we took they shit, now it's time to floss (Let's toast to how funny these guys are, we lock and load)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne & Kurupt]
Get 'em, get 'em, Weezy, hit 'em where you kill 'em easy
Sit 'em in the river, leave 'em, they find 'em tomorrow evening
Sinkin', I'm probably drinkin' that syrup
Thinkin' I won't slip, even though I'm leanin' like a broke hip
He ain't know I got the nina with the full clip
That's a somersault, backspin, full flip for ya
Push this button, I flip out and hit something
Miss nothin', I'm just bustin' until the scene clean
Twelve hundred for the jeans, stop playin'
Hundred dollars for the Glock in my pants, who the man?
I am when I stand with it pointed right at ya face
Knock your brains from the back of ya neck for lack of respect
I strap a jet-black gat 'til the death
Tell my mama to bury me with that, no bullshittin'
My hood gettin' kinda crazy where I be
So Ronnie's with me 'cause he's the OG (Nigga)

[Chorus: Kurupt & Lil Wayne]
We won, we won
And then we shot that BB gun (I told 'em)
And they lost, and they lost
And we took they shit, now it's time to floss (Gotta duck your head, lock and load)
We won (These niggas mad), we won
And then we shot that BB gun (You know they hate you when you get money on 'em)
And they lost, and they lost (But they losin', that's right)
And we took they shit, now it's time to floss (Yeah, lock and load)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne & Kurupt]
Fresh out the back seat of the phiggity-Phantom
The haters, I make 'em madder when I wave at 'em like, "What up?"
If it ain't 'bout money, I keep goin'
I'm tryna get that green, niggas tryna mow my lawn, but fuck
Them boys, I got the shotty on my arm
If them boys run up, I leave they bodies on the lawn
And duck the fuck outta there, 'cause baby, it's outta there
If this was a movie, it's time to roll the credits, cut
It's all over, all of your brains is all over the motherfuckin' block, I'm a motherfuckin' rock
Hardbody, Eagle Street, seventeen shots
Night vision, double clip, hot steady beam Glock
Pop, drop, little man, drop
This is not for little bitches, you man or a fox?
I'm layin' in the drop, thinkin' of more money
Cash Money, Young Money, take money, your money (Nigga)

[Chorus: Kurupt & Lil Wayne]
We won, we won
And then we shot that BB gun
And they lost, and they lost
And we took they shit, now it's time to floss (Yeah, lock and load)
We won, we won (You know, I thought they knew it was really real, Daddy)
And then we shot that BB gun (Yeah, homeboy)
And they lost, and they lost
And we took they shit, now it's time to floss (My motherfuckin' wristband was three hundred dollars, no lie, lock and load)

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Dolce & Gabanna
They should pay me for sayin' that shit
So is my jeans
They wasn't three hundred, but they Dolce too
Yeah
Mhm
We won, motherfucker, we winnin' over here
That's right, hey
Somebody call Gordon, tell him pull up front
Open the doors, suicide 'em
Let's ride out
If you got money, you know what the fuck I'm talkin' 'bout
If you don't, keep thinkin'
If you can do that
Your losing streak is goin' up
Why? 'Cause we here
And I'll fuck this up today, straight up

[Intro: Police Scanner]
Attention all units, attention all units
We have an all-points bulletin out on a man with green hair
I repeat, we have an APB on a man with green hair
He's armed with a knife, I repeat, he's armed with a knife
Proceed with caution, watch your back, fellas
He could be coming at your girlfriend next

[Verse 1]
There's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward
His face is up on the bulletin board with a reward
He'll stab you with a sword, don't be fooled by his charm
He's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm
Ring the alarm, look for a man with green hair
Check at your girl's house, he was last seen there
He's has a mean stare but usually cracks jokes
Good luck on your mission and guard your backs, folks

[Hook]
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch nigga from the hood, haha!
Haha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain’t no good!

[Verse 2]
We got the walkie-talkies to keep us all informed
Suited up head to toe in detective uniforms
Our unit storms in, we split the ghetto in sectors
Lockin' down every block and put up metal detectors
Protect yours and be sure that you stand close
Watch each other's backs and guard your command post
And most of all be advised that he's wise
He could be disguised as one of your very own guys

[Hook]
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch nigga from the hood, haha!
Haha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain’t no good!

[Verse 3]
I'm on a solo mission to find him personally
To settle the score and to beat him unmercifully
For what he first did to me, it's sure to be the last
Followin' footprints with a magnifyin' glass
To drag his lyin' ass back to his padded cell
I'm mad as hell, on the trail of this tattle tail
I heard a yell, the voice sounded familiar
"Give me your girlfriend or I'm gonna kill ya!"

[Hook]
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch nigga from the hood, haha!
Haha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain’t no good!

[Verse 4]
I followed the voice that led down a flight of steps
Sneezin' at dust and swingin' at the spider webs
Inside the depths of his basement
I taste lint in my mouth, then the lights in the place went
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes
I felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs
None of my guys knew where I'm at, I was doomed
Then I remembered the flashlight in my costume

[Hook]
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch nigga from the hood, haha!
Haha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain’t no good!

[Verse 5]
Dealing with backstabbers, there was one thing I learned
They're only powerful when you got your back turned
I yearned for the day that we finally met again
So I can give him a taste of his own medicine
He shed his skin, then he promised to come clean
I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen
Cuffed him at the scene, then dragged the fella home
Beating him over the head with the telephone

[Police Voice]
Attention all cars, attention all cars
Unit 313 has apprehended the suspect
He's going back to the crazy home
I repeat, he's going back to the crazy home
Job well done

[Hook]
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch nigga from the hood, haha!
Haha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain’t no good!
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch nigga from the hood, haha!
Haha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain’t no good!
Come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch nigga from the hood, haha!
Haha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!
(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain’t no good!

[Intro: Angela Workman]
Ain't no one special, special like you
Ain't no one special, special like you
Ain't no one special, special like you
Ain't no one special, special like you

[Chorus: Angela Workman]
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life, baby
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life, baby
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life, baby
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life, baby

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm reminiscin' on your tenderness
And the snugglin' and teasin'
Missin' what I remember
Kissin' and huggin' and squeezin'
Buggin' and wheezin'
I'm havin' trouble when breathin'
It's even tougher when sleepin'
But there's a couple of reasons that I'm sufferin' and grievin'
For lovin' and leavin'
You're all I'm thinkin' of in the evenin'
You got my knees bucklin' and weakenin'
Thoughts of nothin' but freakin'
That I'm strugglin' to keep in
Interrupt when I'm speakin'
I got some game that I'm preparin' to run
The way your lips sparkle and they glare in the sun
You got your hair in a bun
No matter what you're wearin', you stun
'Cause you're comparin' to none
I want to share in the fun, I feel a passionate lust
When I imagine it just alone at last when it's us
I see you graspin' to trust
But my intentions are good, let's leave the past in the dust
I'm not askin' to rush
And answer me immediately
I just wanna be there for you and you to be there for me
If you agree to repeat after me
"I love you" (I love you, baby)
'Cause I just need you to see
How much I'm eager to be your man legally wed
Your love's keepin' me fed
This is easily said, so you can lead or be led
If you care to be down
'Cause ain't nobody like you nowhere to be found

[Chorus: Angela Workman]
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life baby
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life baby
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life baby
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life baby

[Verse 2: Eye-Kyu]
Baby, it's all on you, it's you I call on, boo
Let's set a day up, so you can fall on through
We'll take a spin in a Lexus
You can chill for dinner and breakfast
Time enough to see how this gentleman sexes
We'll start it off with caviar, Dom Pérignon
And then when it's a fact we are warm, carry on
We'll take it slow, see, nobody will hurry things
I got the Izze, the Bacardi and Hurricane
If daiquiris and 

[?] are not your thing that day
It's still all right 'cause I got Minute Maid and Tangeray
You're an incredible one that's rare
I bet in edible underwear
You'll look impeccable, none compare
I dream of freakin' you, the woman that I'm speakin' to, 

[?]
It seems that there is not an end to things that we can do, so
Now we all set to play, only thing left to say
Is when you step away, baby, look over in the négligée

[Chorus: Angela Workman]
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life baby
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life baby
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life baby
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life baby
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life, baby
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life, baby
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life, baby
I been searchin'
But you're the one I want in my life, baby

[Outro: Angela Workman]
Ain't no one special, special like you
Ain't no one special, special like you

[Intro]
Jealous!
Jealous!
Jealous!
Jealous!
Jealous!
Jealous!
Jealous!
Jealous!

[Interlude 1]
Jealous?
What he mean "jealous"? You know what I'm sayin'?
He just mad 'cause he all with them ugly hoes, know what I'm sayin'?
Girls don't buy him no clothes, he bought that ho some clothes!
He don't buy me no clothes, and they ain't got no money
No vibe, no dick, I mean, what do I got to be jealous fo'?
He ain't gonna make it nowhere
He ain't got no type of time, he has no career move, I mean—

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I come home every single day from workin' double shifts
And stop along the way to pick you up a couple gifts
I come inside, and you pretend you miss me when you kiss me
Then you diss me and we strenuously fight continuously
Again you frisk me, for numbers, tryin' to bust me
It must be only just because you never learned to trust me
Plus, we only squabble over irrelevant issues
Too many tissues for my feelings you misuse
I buy you jewelry, you make a fool of me
I bring you diamond rings, you say I'm bad at timin' things
So what's a man to do when all I hand to you is handed back to me?
You act to be this gangsta bitch, that ain't what first attracted me
I used to love your company, now you're always pumpin' me
For information, and you tell your friends you plan on dumpin' me
So I'ma wait for your evacuation
'Cause every accusation makes me wanna smack your face in
See, I've never been so sure, and you're just insecure
So my solution to your jealousy presents a cure
I recommend you take your things and check 'em in
Look at the nervous wreck I'm in, I need my second wind
Say what?—

[Hook]
Jealous! (Oh, jealousy, jealousy!)
Jealous! (Oh, jealousy, jealousy!)
Jealous! (Oh, jealousy, jealousy!)
Jealous! (Oh, jealousy, jealousy!)
Jealous! (Oh, jealousy, jealousy!)
Jealous! (Oh, jealousy, jealousy!)
Jealous! (Oh, jealousy, jealousy!)
Jealous! (Oh, jealousy, jealousy!)

[Interlude 2]
Fuck you and what you goin' through!
Fuck Eminem! He's mad 'cause I left that nigga for another man
To me, Eminem don't mean nothin' but minus money
Immature, me? Nigga, ain't got no dick
No swang in his thang, know what I'm sayin'?
He just mad 'cause I'm gettin' it all night, jealous of me
Know what I'm sayin'? That's what I'm talkin' about
Motherfucker just clock in this pussy, pfft

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I used to be a puppet and a sucker for your silent treatments
I used to be intoxicated with your sweet scents
Until the day I started followin' your feetprints
And tappin' in your phone conversations through the heat vents
It made complete sense: there's someone else you like
So I confronted you and asked you, "Who was Mike?" And you was like
"I need a new nigga! Someone rich that I could follow
And you'll be over me by the time you see tomorrow!"
Leavin' me in sorrow, Brandy never felt so brokenhearted
I fell apart when you departed, then the jokin' started
I was an open target, you play comedian
And I became the laughingstock, but now, I'm on my feet again
And so, we meet again, you're actin' like an ex-wife
All in my sex life, I got a message from Phife
It goes, "You didn't want me to see yo' hon, don't want me now
Take the towel, wipe your brow!" Quit tryin' to hunt me down!
You run me down and now you're tryin' to apologize
For all the lies and every time you made me bawl my eyes
Because I got a bigger wallet size, you wanna swing it
Jealousy is in the house, y'all— fellas, sing it!

[Hook]
Jealous! (Oh, jealousy, jealousy!)
Jealous! (Oh, jealousy, jealousy!)
Jealous! (Oh, jealousy, jealousy!)
Jealous! (Oh, jealousy, jealousy!)
Jealous! (Oh, jealousy, jealousy!)
Jealous! (Oh, jealousy, jealousy!)
Jealous! (Oh, jealousy, jealousy!)
Jealous! (Oh, jealousy, jealousy!)
Jealous! (Oh, jealousy, jealousy!)
Jealous! (Oh, jealousy, jealousy!)
Jealous! (Oh, jealousy, jealousy!)
Jealous! (Oh, jealousy, jealousy!)

[Outro]
Jealous!
Jealous!
Jealous!

[Hook: Eminem]
Chem-le-le-le-le-le-le-le, le-le, le-le
Chem-le-le-le-ne-miah-nuf-niah, ne-nish, ne-ne (Translation:)
So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
‘Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Two pills I pop, 'til my pupils swell up like two pennies
I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid-twenties
A young-ass man with a trash can, strapped to the back
Of his ass so the rats can't chew through his last pants
I'm like a mummy at night, fightin' with bright lightnin'
And frightened with five little white Vicodin pills bitin' him
I'm like a fuckin' wasp in the hospital, lost
Stingin' the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls
I light a candle and place it up on the mantel
Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin' handle
So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurtin'
(Bitch, it's too late)
‘Cause once you're hung from the drapes, it's curtains

[Verse 2: Swifty]
I'm an instigator, .380 slug penetrator
Degradin', creatin' murders to kill haters
Accused for every crime known through the equator
They knew I did it for havin' blood on my 'gators
My weed'll hit your chest like a double barrel gauge and
I'm a black grenade that'll blow up in yo' face
With a fifth in me, when I guzzle Remy I do shit on purpose
You never hear me say, "Forgive me"
I'm snatchin' every penny, it gotta be that way, nigga, face it
That weed I sold to you, Brigade laced it
You hidin', I make the President get a facelift
Niggas just afraid, handin' me they bracelets
Chillin' in the lab wasted, I'm the type
That'll drink Kahlua and gin, throw up on the mic
Your life is ruined, you get socked right on sight
And even at the Million Man March, we gon' fight

[Hook: Eminem]
So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
‘Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!
‘Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit
‘Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!

[Verse 3: Bizarre]
I'm a compulsive liar, settin' my preacher on fire
Slashin' your tires, flyin' down Fenkell and Meyers
Plates expired, soon as I'm hired I'm fired
Jackin' my dick off in a bed of barbed wire
(Hey, is Bizarre performin'?) Bitch, didn't you read the flyer?
The special invited guest will be Richard Pryor
(Aren't you a male dancer?) No, bitch, I'm retired
Fuckin' your bitch in the ass with a tire iron
I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip
My DJ's in a coma for lettin' the record skip
Lettin' the record skip, lettin' the record skip (Damn!)
I'm fuckin' anything when I'm snortin'
It's gonna cost three-hundred dollars to get my pitbull an abortion
Some bitch asked for my autograph
I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed
I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam
All bitches is hoes, even my stinkin'-ass mom

[Verse 4: Proof]
Ayo, flashback, two feets, two deep up in that ass crack
Weed laced with somethin'– nigga, pass that!
In Amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats
At a "Stop the Violence" rally, I blast gats
BMI on publishin'; get yo' ass capped
The Kuniva, divide up yo' cash stack
Run yo' motherfuckin' pockets, ASAP
I don't need a platinum chain, bitch, I snatched Shaq's
Born loser, half thief and half black
Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at
Bitch smacker, rich rappers get they Jag jacked
And found chopped up in a trash bag

[Verse 5: Kuniva]
We stranglin' rappers until the point they can't yell
‘Cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales
Reckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace
Gruesome, and causin' more violence than nine hoodlums
I grapple your Adam's apple until it crackle
Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you
Get executed, ‘cause I'm a Luni, I got a Yukmouth
And it's polluted; I cock it back, then shoot it
I love snatchin' up players, thugs and young ballers
Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers
Brigade barricade to bring the noise
While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys
If I go solo, I'm doin' a song with Bolo
A big Chinese nigga screamin', "Kuniva, yo, yo!"
I leave ya face leakin', run up in church
And smack the preacher while he's preachin'
Take a swing at the deacon

[Verse 6: Kon Artis]
I used to tell cats that I sold weed and weight
I was straight 'til I got caught sellin' them shake
I'm ignorant, with the intent to snatch your rent
I got kicked out of summer camp for havin' sex in my tent
With the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order
I've been a Kon Artis since I was swimmin' in water
In cahoots with this nigga named Carlisle Von
Who got fired from UPS for tryin' to send you a bomb
(Special delivery) I sign to a local label for fun
Say I got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run
Drive-by you in the rain while you carry your son
Call your house and hang up on you for not givin' me none
Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun
Got a reputation for havin' niggas runnin' they funds
Used to be the type of nigga that was foldin' some ones
'Til I met your fat mama, now I'm rollin' in dough

[Hook: Eminem]
So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit
‘Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!
‘Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit
‘Cause I was high when I wrote this, so suck my dick!

[Outro: Eminem]
Ha-ha! Suck my motherfuckin' dick!
D12, Dirty-motherfuckin'-Dozen
Nasty like a stank slut bitch with thirty fuckin' husbands
Bizarre Kid, Swifty McVay, the Kon Artis
The Kuniva, Derty Harry, and Slim Shady

[Intro: Eminem]
Ayo, before I start this song, man
I just wanna thank everybody for being so patient
And bearing with me over these last couple of years
While I figure this shit out

[Chorus: Kobe & Eminem]
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah, woah-woah, woah-woah
Woah-woah, woah-woah, woah-woah
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, then lend me an ear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I went away, I guess, and opened up some lanes
But there was no one who even knew I was goin' through growin' pains
Hatred was flowin' through my veins, on the verge of goin' insane
I almost made a song dissin' Lil Wayne
It's like I was jealous of him 'cause of the attention he was gettin'
I felt horrible about myself, he was spittin'
And I wasn't, anyone who was buzzin' back then coulda got it
Almost went at Kanye too, God, it
Feels like I'm goin' psychotic, thank God that I didn't do it
I'da had my ass handed to me, and I knew it
But Proof wasn't here to see me through it
I'm in the booth, poppin' another pill, tryna talk myself into it
"Are you stupid? You're gon' start dissin' people for no reason?
'Specially when you can't even write a decent punchline even? You're lyin' to yourself
You're slowly dyin', you're denyin', your health
Is declinin' with your self-esteem, you're cryin' out for help"

[Chorus: Kobe and Eminem]
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, then lend me an ear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

[Verse 2: Eminem & Kobe]
Marshall, you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow
All I know is I'm wallowing, self-loathing and hollow
Bottoms up on the pill bottle
Maybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow
My sorrow echoes in this hall though (Oh-oh, oh)
But I must be talkin' to the wall though, I don't see nobody else
(I guess I keep talkin' to myself)
But all these other rappers suck is all that I know
I've turned into a hater, I put up a false bravado
But Marshall is not an egomaniac, that's not his motto
He's not a desperado, he's desperate
His thoughts are bottled inside him
One foot on the brake, one on the throttle
Fallin' asleep with writer's block in the parkin' lot of McDonald's
But instead of feeling sorry for yourself, do something 'bout it
Admit you got a problem, your brain is clouded
You pouted long enough
It isn't them, it's you, you fuckin' baby!
Quit worryin' 'bout what they do, and do Shady
I'm fuckin' goin' crazy

[Chorus: Kobe & Eminem]
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, then lend me an ear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

[Verse 3: Eminem]
So I picked myself up off the ground
And fuckin' swam 'fore I drowned
Hit my bottom so hard I bounced twice, suffice, this time around
It's different, them last two albums didn't count
Encore, I was on drugs; Relapse, I was flushin' 'em out
I've come to make it up to you now, no more fuckin' around
I got somethin' to prove to fans, 'cause I feel like I let 'em down
So please accept my apology, I finally feel like I'm back to normal
I feel like me again, let me formally
Reintroduce myself to you for those of you who don't know
The new me's back to the old me
And homie, I don't show no signs of slowin' up
Oh, and I'm blowin' up all over
My life is no longer a movie, but the show ain't over, homos
I'm back with a vengeance, homie
Weezy, keep ya head up, T.I., keep ya head up
Kanye, keep ya head up, don't let up
Just keep slayin' them, rest in peace to DJ AM
'Cause I know what it's like
I struggle with this shit every single day, and um…

[Chorus: Kobe & Eminem]
Is anybody out there?
It feels like I'm talkin' to myself
No one seems to know my struggle
And everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me?
Yeah, I guess I keep talkin' to myself
It feels like I'm goin' insane
Am I the one who's crazy?
Yeah
So why in the world do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there who feels the way I feel?
If there is, then lend me an ear
Just so I know that I'm not the only one

[Outro: Eminem]
So there it is, damn
Feels like I just woke up or something
I guess I just forgot who the fuck I was, man
Ayo, and to anybody I thought about going at
It was never nothing personal
It was just some shit I was going through
And to everybody else, I'm back! (I'm back!)
Ha-ha (Ha-ha)

[Intro]
It's like this and like that and like this
It's like this and like that and like this

[Verse 1]
I'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless, patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beating James Todd, Sr
And smackin' his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in the wild hood as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood that I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed but kept the same mind-state
Since the third time that I failed 9th grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of death as I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind, you and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not? Blow your brain out, I'm blowing mine out
Fuck it, you only live once you might as well die now

[Verse 2]
It's only fair to warn, I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my damn umbilical cord
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a 2 by 4 board
And smash into your Honda Accord with a 4 door Ford
But I'm more towards droppin' an acappella that'll chop a fella
To Mozzarella, worse than a helicopter propeller
Got you locked in the cellar with your skeleton showing
Developing anorexia while I'm standing next to ya
Eating a full course meal watching you starve to death
With an IV in your veins feeding you liquid darvocet
Pumping you full of drugs, pull the plugs
On the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up in an ambulance and driven
To receiving with the asses ripped out of they pants and given
A less than 20 percent chance of living
Have a possible placement, it's a hospital patient
Storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived
To perform an autopsy on you while you scream "I'm still alive!"
Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp
And pulling your Adam's apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department, I've hired an arson
To set fire to carpets and burn up your entire apartment
I'm a liar to start shit
Got your bitch wrapped around my dick
So tight, you need a crowbar to pry her apart with
Motherfucker
Slim Shady, bitch

[Verse 3]
Met a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg
Snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg
Go to bed with the keg, wake up with the 40
Mix it with Alka Seltzer and Formula 44D
Fuck an acid tab, I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead
Wait until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead
No more said, case closed, end of discussion
I'm blowing up like spontaneous human combustion
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
Cross the bombers? We blowing up your house killing your parents
And coming back to get your foster mommas
And I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nostradamus
Cause I ain't making no more threats
I'm doing drive-bys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets
I'm more or less sick in the head
Maybe more cause I smoked crack today, yesterday and the day before
Saboteur, walk the block with a Labrador
Strapped with more corral for war than El Salvador
Foul style galore, verbal cow manure
Coming together like an eyebrow on Al B. Sure!
Motherfucker

[Sample: Eminem]
"So let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?"
What is this?—What is this?

[Intro: Eminem]
The Invasion! (Invasion!)
Yeah! Yeah!
Green Lantern! (Green Lantern!)
The infiltration
We coming! Yeah!

[Bridge: Eminem]
I got 50 Cent, I got G-Unit (Uh-huh)
D-Twizzy in this bitch (Haha), with Obie Trice (Woo!)
So watch what you say (Uh-huh), 'fore you call our name (Yep)
'Cause you say one more thing and it won't be nice!

[Verse: Eminem]
Whoa, here we go, I should've known
I was bound to get pulled into some bullshit
Sooner or later, you little haters
Are too jealous of us, still love us, you hate it, G-Unit made it
And Obie's coming, D-Twizzy's coming
You're sick to your stomach ("UGH!")
Fifty percent of it's 50 Cent
The other 50 percent of it's whose color of skin it is
But if you even considering taking our label down
You better find our building and fly a fucking plane into it
But I ain't trying to get too intricate into it
I'm just tryna give you a little hint for your own benefit
'Cause then it's gonna get to the point where it escalates
Into some other shit, then I'ma flip
Then I'ma get to "Stomping in my Air Force Ones"
But you won't be able to tell if it's two pairs or it's one
It's just gonna feel like so many feet kicking you
You'll think Nike just made these into cleats in the shoe
I don't know what it is or what it could be
But I get a woody when these pussies try to push me
Thinking they gonna put me in a position to pickle me (Woo!)
Y'all tickle me pink, I think I'd just rather have P!nk tickle me (Hehe)
Hickory-dickory-dock, tickety-tock-tickety
A little bit of the diggedy-Doc-diggedy
Mixed with a little bit of the Jigga-J-Jigga
With a small pinch of Biggie
Look at me, I'm just the bomb-diggedy

[Hook: Eminem]
We the realest label
Don't try to act like you don't feel our label
'Cause we gon' fuck around and kill your label
Obie, D-Twizzy, G-Unit, 50, Shady Records, we the label fa' sho!
We the realest label
Don’t try to act like you don’t feel our label
'Cause we gon' fuck around and steal your paper
Obie, D-Twizzy, G-Unit, 50, we gon' kill your fucking label fa' sho!
Yeah!

[Post-Hook: Eminem]
Shady in the place to be see
And I got what it takes to rock the mic right!
Still watch what you say to me, punk
'Cause I'm off probation in less than six months! {*gun cocks*}

[Outro: Eminem]
Haha! (Woo!)
Shady Records
Still Aftermath
And don't think we don't hear you motherfuckers talking!
'Cause we do
We see y'all
But we just gon' sit back for a minute and watch what the FUCK y'all do!

[Eminem]
I'll leave your blueprints covered in shoe prints
Poppin' Nuprin
Neighborhood nuisance
Murder your family for two cent
Makin' your crew tense
Brain's too dense
Leave the mic with two dents
Fresher than a whole mouth full of chewed mints
Givin' you rude hints
Cause if you're wack I'm gonna tell ya
I got the issue where they diss you in next month's Source I'm gonna mail ya
You're a failure
You're style's staler than a bowl of hardened rice
Scarred and sliced
I flunked kindergarten twice
But you ain't hard and nice
And you sure ain't servin' no bids
Sayin' you did is like seein' a damn virgin with kids
Creepin' like a phantom
Holdin' my dick like the Player's Anthem
Holdin' this microphone for ransom
Bitches ask me why do I talk nasty?
Grab an ass of every trashy whore that walks past me
My crew's on drugs, lookin' like zombies
Smokin' bomb trees
Racin' police in Dodge Omnis

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Lock, cock and explode
Way beyond bitin' a nigga
Get hungry, disconnect my jaw and swallow you whole
I'm probably gonna blow
Go to hell holdin' a mill
Street smart, under educated, over skilled
I'm tight to the vest
You wanna rip me off? Then try
I fight to the death, who wanna piss me off, then die?
Curse niggas that try, I'm the first nigga to bust
You the second nigga to pull, and the first nigga to die
How dare you think that you gleam like the rest of my team
You a bitch, you like a chip off a berget in my ring
Stick to my words, so I don't threaten niggas no more
If I make you a promise, then it's safe to say that it's honest
My guns is tired from being fired
While yours sits on the shelf
I'm like a song concept in itself
Totin' my weapon, burnin' your vest
In '99, wack niggas learn from the best and hope to be second
Nigga
Kool Kid nigga
What? Royce 5'9", Slim Shady, motherfucker

[Hook]
It's murder she wrote (it's murder she wrote)
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked (for her to be smoked)
It's murder she wrote (it's murder she wrote)
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked (for her to be smoked)
It's murder she wrote (it's murder she wrote)
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked (for her to be smoked)
It's murder she wrote (it's murder she wrote)
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked (for her to be smoked)

[Verse 1]
Left the keys in the van, with a gat in each hand
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman
Fuck a peace plan, if a citizen bystands
The shit is in my hands, here's yo' lifespan
And for what yo' life's worth, this money is twice than
Grab a couple grand and lamp in Iceland
See I'm a nice man but money turned me to Satan
I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydratin
Hurry up with the cash bitch, I got a ride waitin
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried skatin
I want the whole pie, I won't be denied nathan
Maybe I need my head inside straightened
Brain contemplatin, clean out the register
Dip before somebody catches ya
Or gets your description and sketches ya
The connection was the prime suspect
But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
Cause I got a daughter to feed
And $200 ain't enough to water the seed
The best thing would be for me to leave Taco Bell and hit up Chess King
And have the lady at the desk bring
Money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin the Mac
Cooperate, and we can operate, and save an attack
This bitch tried escapin the jack
Grabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote
You barely heard a word as she choked
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked
But I slammed her on her back til her vertebrae broke
Just then the pigs bust in yellin "Freeze"
But I'm already wanted for sellin ki's
And bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin bees
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees
I bust shots, they bust back
Hit be square in the chest, wasn't wearin a vest

[Verse 2]
Left the house, pullin out the drive backin out
Blew the back end out this lady's Jag, started blackin out
Pulled the Mac-10 out, stuck it in her face
Shut your yackin mouth, 'fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp
Drug her by her hair, smacked her up
Thinkin fuck it, mug her while you're there, jacked her up
Stole her car, made a profit
Grabbed the tape from out the deck and offed it out the window
Like the girl in "Set It Off" did
Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal
Drove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin pool
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio
I made it out alive but I'm injured badly though
Parents screamin: "Son, go in and call the police
Tell em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace!"
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
Actin like they never seen nobody hit a lick before
Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64
When they sell out in stores the price triples
I ran up the block jumpin kids on tricycles
And collided with an 80-year old lady with groceries
There goes cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties
Stood up and started to see stars
Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars
Barely escaped, must-a been some dumb luck
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin dump truck
But I think somebody seen me maybe
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I musta dropped the Beanie Baby
Fuck it I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits
Came out with a white flag hollerin "TRUCE TRUCE"
And surrendered my weapon to cops
Wasn't me! It was the gangster rap and the peppermint Schnapps

[Hook]
It's murder she wrote (it's murder she wrote)
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked (for her to be smoked)
It's murder she wrote (it's murder she wrote)
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked (for her to be smoked)
It's murder she wrote (it's murder she wrote)
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked (for her to be smoked)
It's murder she wrote (it's murder she wrote)
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked (for her to be smoked)

[Verse 1]
Step right up, I'm about to light up the skyline
So bright, I'mma fuck your whole night up
Light up your glow sticks and go stick a stick in your ass
This is the ghost of Christmas past
This is your host, you're supposed to kiss his ass
This is gross but listen close, if you don't
You can go stick your whole frickin' nose against his crack
'til he lets one go and blows your whiskers back
And get a great big old whiff cause if you last without passing out
You'll be on the next episode of Fear Factor, yeah, I'm back to, back to what?
I don't know, smack a little child actor's butt, Mike Jackson, what?
What the fuck you want? I got a blunt and some Jesus juice
Who needs an excuse these days
The way they rally around pedophiles, you lucky I don't pee in your face
I can do anything and apologize for it later as long
As it ain't a racist tape from '88, than I'm straight of that cannot be forgave
If I drank pee for, 18 years straight and ate shit every day
On a porcelain plate that was shaped like a toilet with a fork and steak, knife
For the rest of my life and had to watch my ex-wife get fucked by Vanilla Ice
Twice a day, cause I said N-I-G-G-A, when I was a teenager
Blaow-blaow, Shade uh 45, shorty, let me get your number, baby
Maybe I can hump your leg or something?
But it's time for me to go, so I stopped, jumped in the vehicle
It's like this, because of that boob, right?

[Prelude: Eminem, Mr. Porter & Tim Westwood]
Yo blast me off, Tim
Where's that boom?
Blast me off, son
Pew, pew, pew- pew, pew!
The bombs, man!
Right now, we're doin' this for Beijing, baby, understand how it's goin' down
That's how he talk
Blastin' off right now, son!
Real big, real legendary up in the game
Yeah
Drippin' in swagger juice
Yeah
We ready to go in this?
Yeah, yeah

[Part I: "Respect My Conglomerate" by Busta Rhymes]

[Intro 1: Eminem, Mr. Porter & Tim Westwood]
Are we swaggered up?
Swaggered up, yeah
Let's do it, baby, Radio 1, Westwood, sample's about to go down
Check my swag
Eminem, Kon, baby, Alchemist, we're doin' it like this
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let's go, baby
A'ight, a'ight, look

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I wasn't born mean, I was pushed to treachery
I walk the streets, lookin' for some puss to fetch me
I'm like a veggie, brain is turned to mush, I'm edgy
Edgy enough to give Reggie Bush a wedgie
If he don't gimme Kim, things could get messy
So pass that ass to me, let me squish the left cheek
And press against the right one 'til it's smushed against me
And leave a dead body in the woods, the emcee
With the Christopher Reeves beef, we started off on the wrong foot
Or should I say fake leg made outta wood?
I shouldn't, yes, I should
Ridin' through the hood, I'm chillin' with Westwood
I'm quite mellow, a white fellow
My pee is bright yellow, I like Jell-O
I'm like, "Hello," to a cute little dyke on the mic
I'm kinda like Iron Mike 'cause I bite earlobes

[Interlude 1: Mr. Porter & Eminem]
Yeah
Well, I must must say (Yeah?)
Well, um, I'm just not gay
Well, um, I must must say
Um, well, look- (Mr. Porter, son)

[Verse 2: Mr. Porter]
See I'm the first one to class and the last to leave
I mean the first one to leave outta class, believe
That I'm a mailbox pimp in my heart 'til I die
Even after I'm all gone and my ashes fried
Went from an ashy guy, class clown as high
To a grown-ass man stackin' motherfuckin' paper
Runyon Ave.'s the clique, D12's the game
We've been spittin' this shit since we was little bébés
Gaga goo goo, nana, nani do do, never
Word to my homie Em, I'm just too too clever
A 4-5 shot'll leave a nigga's face lop-sided
The kick from the barrel make you think I'm cock-eyeded, 
When I bust it off in the crowd, niggas start divin'
Greg Louganis went over the bar, I ain't lyin'
Hot iron lethals, not defyin' a soldier
Runyon Ave. soldier equals death when it's over
It's none colder than niggas that understand the struggle
Apply the street-muscle, we've been had to hustle
We've been had to hustle, we've been had to muscle
Apply the street hustle, we've been had to hustle

[Verse 3: Eminem & Mr. Porter]
Yeah, aight
Me and Westwood, blastin' off, jackin' off
In a pair of acid-washed, bumpin' Asher Roth
Cruisin' Gratiot 'til I damn near crashed the car
I'm tryna smash 'em off in the dash, hit the overpass, went off (Woo!)
Over the bridge, into oncoming traffic, caused
A massive forty-two car pile-up, not a scratch at all (Woo!)
Hopped up holdin' an axe and saw
Jason mask is off when my face is plastered in tabasco sauce
Spittin' flames, kickin' fire out your ass, you little bastard
You can pass it on, I'm battery acid, dawg
You don't wanna get my ass ticked off
I'm harder than playin' basketball while I'm goin' through crack withdrawal (Woo!)
Dick so big it's like elastic
I tie it in a knot and it looks like Mr. Fantastic crossed
The path of Plastic Man with a drastic force
And went spastic, put my penis on classic sports (Look)

[Interlude 3: Mr. Porter]
Woo!
God, look, look-

[Verse 4: Mr. Porter & Eminem]
I shoot straight off the hip, trey-eight off the rip
But see, I ain't fo' that shit
I got a fist print fo' yo' lip
Lookin' shit is swole up like the stomach on a fat pregnant bitch
And it's evident that I get chips like the president
Been a lotta rules, keep the tools for the haters left
Niggas ain't fadin' 'em, seal a crack, do a trim
Got a lot of dough, but you know I ain't trickin' on 'em
Get some head spinnin' on 'em, keep the head spinnin' on 'em
See, I ain't diggin' on 'em, keep the head hidden from 'em
You know how it go, no dough trickin' on 'em
She just wanna blow, see what she can get from 'em
But she don't know my name, I'm 'bout the game, I'm pickin' on her
Wrist so cold that my left hand's numb as summer
I rip a hole 'til she don't want you gettin' on her
She makes you wonder if the women even want ya
Mr. Porter, keep a ho in order
Learned it from my daddy, I teach it to my daughter (Yeah)
Ya ought to know the quota of my whole workout
I float like Noah and I don't want the boat to rover bounce

[Interlude 4: Eminem & Mr. Porter]
Ahaha, yeah
Yeah, ayy, let's change that beat, homie
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Where's the swag juice, Al?
Come on, homie
Swag drip
Swag is dryin' up right now
Where's the swag?

[Part II: "Microphone" by Slaughterhouse]

[Interlude 5: Eminem]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Alright, alright
Yeah, yeah
Yo

[Verse 5: Eminem]
Once again, it's the sinister, cynical, minister Shady
Kryptonite to Superman, he's a dentist to Amy
Administer of the pain, just finished huffin' the paint
And muffled the fumes like it was nothin', because it ain't
Anything in his way, his enemies he just slays
His venom he spray reaches like beams of energy rays
Menacin' stares, he glares, makin' the hairs
All on the back of yo' neck stand like Dracula, yep
Spectacular rep, he's a tarantula, gargantuan
Yeah, Angela, so I command you to start dancin'
Part Manson, part Hannibal, part mechanical shark
Throwin' animal parts at Scarlett Johansson
Enter my gas chamber, you're gangsta my ass
He's got his fangs to your neck, he's set to strangle ya ass, hater
You're facin' a task greater, he's chasin' your ass
He's got his face in a mask, your bloodstains on his glass table

[Verse 6: Mr. Porter]
I'm so obnoxious, open hand slap a nigga, you wouldn't
See, you couldn't, you went off cryin' like Cuba Gooding
I swan dive in your bitch pussy, I call her puddin'
She love her some nani, I love the bitch cookin'
Scrap back, you niggas weak as Chuck Nevitt
I fuck buckin' naked; Jesus piece swing reckless
Entrepo-po head honcho, hope you're ready 'fore
I pop his ass, nigga, kickin' through your door
You send goons to do your work
I send goons to mamas in church, I've been a problem since birth
Got a middle finger up her skirt
I don't ask a bitch on a date, I ask her can I fuck her first
See y'all with this Runyon shit
I made somethin' out of nothin', I'm a hustler, bitch
I keep a 9 tucked, burnin' up the side of my hip
Gotta make a hit for any nigga for fifty-thousand chips

[Interlude: Mr. Porter & Eminem]
Bitch!
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Aight

[Verse 7: Eminem]
I'm checking the exposure of photos of me exposing
Myself locked inside of a cozy hotel, posing
With or without clothing, next to the decomposing
Bodies eroding while I'm dozing off, overdosing
Windows opening, shutting, doors opening, closing
I think there's a ghost, too much hydrocodone and codeine
I was only s'posed to swallow a half, I took the whole thing
I'm not joking, I think I just snorted my nose ring
I need a drink, I'm standin' over the sink, posing
Myself, self-loathing, 'cause I'm on a brink, mostly
I don't wanna think, "This will make everything rosy"
Beverly sings, scream while I'm severing three toe-sies
Totally frozen while I close in, I'm yodeling
"Rosey, won't you come out to play?" Ain’t no sense
Wasting time, cutting and pasting headlines in the papers
Making shrines of my crimes and capers
My words are whirlwinds, I murder my girlfriends
Go to Europe and put Neurofens in my syrup and stir them
You never heard him like this, so don't encourage him
The neurosurgeon, coke mirrors, and lyrics worse than
The kinda person to get Katie Couric to cursin'
Eighty spirits of ladies 'cause Shady murdered the virgins
Crazy turn of events, and then he emerged, took
Over the world and reeled in all the children
Lured 'em into the buildin' and killed 'em
Buried 'em in the mulch and mildew and he will do what he feels, and
Still can spin straw into gold like Rumpelstiltskin
Cotton to silk, Motrin to Tylenol— three pills, the Real Slim
Shady's entered the buildin'
There's nothin' but crumbled leaves and tumbleweeds up in this bitch, Mildrid
He's ill wit' it, he still shouldn't be healed
There's no one as sick as he, emcees'll get fricasseed on the grill then

[Interlude 7: Mr. Porter]
Woah
Alright

[Part III: "Chonkyfire" by Outkast]

[Interlude 8: Mr. Porter & Tim Westwood & Eminem]
Fuck that! Aha
Right now
Ahahahaha
Building's on fire
Fuck you, Em!
You want to start with the hook first?
Oh, okay
I have no idea what I'm doing
I have no idea what I'm doing, but

[Verse 8: Eminem]
Everybody get up, sit up, Christopher
They're miserable without you, Superman is a-
-live and he's flowin' like the Mystic River
Girl, don't act like you've never been kissed before
One, two, three, four, five, six, this-a
Rhyme is about to hit you right in the kisser
How did anybody ever find me? I disa-
-ppeared, I was hidin' in Freeway's beard, just a
Hop, skip and I jump from my skin gushin'
Nails into my face that I've been pushin'
Hellraiser, my face is my pin cushion
It's like when I'm on the mic, I can squish a
Sucker like a vise grip, my pen put ya
In the slaughterhouse, 'cause your style's been butchered
I'll spin chainsaw, take off, like the blades on
My brain's on hyperdrive, someone put the brakes on

[Chorus: Eminem & Mr. Porter, both]
Here's a smidgen, a midget to get your digits, Bridget
Don't try to fidget with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slippin' on my swag juice, my swag juice
I got you slippin' on my swag juice, my swag juice
Now here's a smidgen, a midget to get your digits, Bridget
Don't try to fidget with it, ribbit ribbit (Huh-uh)
I got you slippin' on my swag juice, my swag juice (Yeah)
I got you slippin' on my swag juice (Okay, look)

[Verse 9: Mr. Porter]
I got it figured out now, nigga, see
My-My mind's right, money right, can't nobody stoppin' how I get it
In hindsight, I never should'a left where I was livin'
I pro'bly wouldn't be gettin' pressed by all these women
But then again, I wouldn't have met the ones that I was diggin'
Sanaa Lathan lookin', talk a lot
Don't she like Lil Kim and Kim and, uh, Serena Williams?
Just like my 

[?] I'm a regular Charles Dickens
Bitch, called me talkin' 'bout she pregnant
She praised me, so I Mannie Fresh'd that ho and left baby
I'll never trust her, no
Shit, even if she specialize in mouth, massagin' my testicles
I never trust her a whole lot
Even on the first day we met, she's basically gettin' her mouth raped
Then turned around and ask me for a kiss, "No, bitch, I'm straight"
I never really been concerned with how my own dick taste

[Pre-Chorus: Mr. Porter & Eminem]
I think I'm 'bout to slip on my swag juice
I think I'm 'bout to slip on your swag juice
Oh no! No, no, don't slip on your swag juice!
Yeah, yeah, I think I'm 'bout to slip on my swag juice

[Chorus: Eminem & Mr. Porter, both]
So here's a smidgen, a midget to get your digits, Bridget
Don't try to fidget with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slippin' on my swag juice, my swag juice
I got you slippin' on my swag juice, alright, ayy

[Verse 10: Eminem]
Slim is in the house, simmer down there, sister
Bound to get you dizzy, 'cause he gets as busy as a
Bee- baby, you could throw a frisbee in a blizzard
He'll catch it in his teeth, what is he? He's a wizard
Standin' in the disco with a disco biscuit
And I'm pretty sure it isn't Bisquick, is it?
Now, baby, don't forget to bring your lipstick wit' ya
I want the kiss 'fore I blow this bitch to smithe-
-reens, get the guillotines, this is a situ-
-ation that's critical as Dre spins his, uh
Turntables and he cuts the record like a scissor
Checka-chicky-checka-chicky-checka-checka-chicka
We'll wreck it in a second, tell me what the heck is sicker?
Wait a minute, I just dropped my necklace in the liquor
Now, baby, just to make a little breakfast and it's six o'-
-clock in the mornin', 'less you want to get some dessert

[Chorus: Eminem & Mr. Porter, both]
So here's a smidgen, a midget to get your Bridgets, digit
Don't try to fidget with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slippin' on my swag juice, my swag juice
I got you slippin' on my swag juice
I said, here's a smidgen, a midget to get your digits, Bridget
Don't try to fidget with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slippin' on my swag juice, my swag juice
I got you slippin' on my swag, my swag juice

[Outro: Eminem, Mr. Porter & Tim Westwood, Eminem & Mr. Porter]
Yeah!
Hahahahaha
Hahahahaha
Ayo
Just so everybody knows, that was a hook
That we made on the way to the radio station
And we were tryin' to get it right
So we may have fucked it up a couple times or whatever, but
This is what we were tryin' to, like, work out before we came here
Especially for Westwood, man! 'Specially for you, homie!
Damn, Eminem! Thanks for listening, baby

[Intro: Bizarre]
Yeah… ha ha ha (Bang!)
Yeah, Bizarre Kid comin' at you
Eminem and Fuzz and Mr. Swifty, ha ha
No one's iller than me (What?)
No one, no one is iller than me
No one is iller than me
It's Mr. Swifty from the 313

[Verse 1: Swifty McVay]
I make rappers wanna turn into singers
I keep hoes lickin' they fingers
Bring this competition and face this meaning
Got your whole crew doin' subpoenas
Hell nah, you ain't seen a crew, genius
Murder whoever's between us, pack your heaters
Keep it close, you can't beat us
While your whole crew treat us like G's, you best believe this
I done made quadriplegics outta these non-rappin' rejects
While the whole world ejects your tape
It ain't no secret that your shit sounds fake
You can't stop it, my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
I'm like toothaches: I'm painful to rappers
Then you can tell from these shells
How I gotta bend 'em like root canals
I erase all trails, somethin' farther from gettin' bail
Makes you wanna kill an emcee yourself, you might as well
Be within a 25 to life sentence, on linking trials
Horrified, and keep on frontin', repentin' and lose they bowels
Everything is foul when Swift's around, vacate now
Niggas dumb enough to try to front and escape, how?
I'm gonna take this 'gnac and drink it straight wild
Niggas steady fallin' in my face like milk crates – BLAAAOW!
It's Swifty from the 313
Like I said, no one is iller than me, unnhh

[Verse 2: Bizarre]
Me and Eminem and Mike, drivin' down Van Dyke
Get my dick sucked late at night by a fuckin' transvestite
Still on probation for stranglin' my boy Jason
Should be takin' my medication, it's nine to 10 I'm facin'
Last week this old man I had to blast
‘Cause he tried to help me out when my car was out of gas
Ripped this old lady, hung her neck by a hook
Didn't realize it was my grandmother 'til I checked her pocketbook
Fuckin' with the white boys got me back on crack
Better explain where the hell your TV's and VCR's is at
I done lost 100 pounds, I ain't been eatin' like I should
This wounded dog in the street is sure lookin' good
Rob this little boy in his fuckin' paper route
Throwin' bombs at day care centers and yell: "Everybody get out!"
My girl beat my ass and shot me in the back with a two-piece
‘Cause she found out I was havin' an affair
With her 10-year-old niece

[Hook: Bizarre]
No one, no one's iller than me
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Nobody better test me, ‘cause I don't wanna get messy
Especially when I step inside this bitch, dipped freshly
New Lugz, give the crew hugs, guzzle two mugs
Before I do drugs that make me throw up like flu bugs
True thugs, rugged unshaven messy scrubs
Whippin' 40-bottles like the fuckin' Pepsi clubs
Down a fifth, crack open a six
I'm on my seventh 8-Ball, now I gotta take a piss
I'm hollerin' at these hoes that got boyfriends
Who gives a fuck who they was?
I'm always takin' someone else's girl like Cool J does
They probably don't be packin' anyways — do they, Fuzz?
We walked up, stomped they asses and blew they buzz
Mics get sandblasted, stab your abdomen
With a hand-crafted pocketknife and spill your antacid
Sprayed your motherfuckin' crib up when I ran past it
Fuckin' felon, headed to Hell in a handbasket
Talkin' shit'll get you, your girl and your man blasted
Kidnapped and slapped in a van, wrapped in Saran plastic
Get your damn ass kicked
By these fantastic furious four motherfuckers
Flashin' in front of your face without the Grandmasters
Slim Shady, ain't nobody iller than me

[Verse 4: Fuzz Scoota]
I run shit like an ass with legs
Massive lead to leave your cabbage red
Similar to your ass in a casket dead
Drastic spread of acid heads
Come to abort you like a bastard egg
That trash you said got you standin' on plastic legs
Ask the feds if I'm past the edge
Rockin' the most classic threads, flashin' bread
Roll down the window: "Bitch, you got some fantastic legs!"
You can get 'til that ass get red
You can get 'til that ass get red
Bizarre, you get him and him
Swift, you get him and him, I'll get him and him
Leave the other two for my nigga Eminem
Never writer's block, I block writers
My block's tighter, ante up and get your top fighters
Got fired for jumpin' the counter with a mop stick
Some bitch ran up screamin', "Get the cops, quick!"
And got drop kicked, now she screamin', "Stop it!"
Got clips to stop shit, rock shit and grab this hot shit
Wherever you shop, bitch, Fuzz Scoota '97 crop pick
Sick of y'all niggas lookin' at me like I got tits
I shoot a rocket through your optic
You niggas still don't know the top pick
I got bricks, lose my foot in your ass
And have you shittin' socks, bitch
P Rock shit, leave your fuckin' knot split
Grab the green from Al by showin' him hot grits
(No one) — Ain't nobody iller than me

[Hook: Bizzare]
It's the Mr. Fuzzy from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Eminem and Swift from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Fuzz and Buzz-arre from the 313

[Outro: Bizzare]
You have now witnessed four ill emcees
From the home of potholes and trash
We'll lyrically blast

Baby, let's cruise with the radio tunes
You know the best times come when there's nothin' to do
It's rare get a minute or two
So I cherish every second with a girl like you
Ain't nothin' like a home girl down for the ride
Nothin' like a home girl down for life

Be my umbrella through the rain or shine

[Verse 1: J-Splif]
When I'm out of state, I know you rep me (Rep me)

You need a shoulder to cry on, need someone to rely on
I want you to know when, you need a friend

Definitely a friend you can depend on
You can depend on me
Like my name was Smokey
So when things don't seem to be going your way
And nothin' seems to be going right (Goin' right)

And turn your darkness to light (To light)
I'll be around and turn your frown upside down
Permanently
Because you been a good woman to me
You deserve the best and nothing less
For the best is what you get
And all my respect (And all my respect)
What'd you expect?

[Verse 3: Baby Bash]
I'll always be your player potna, in and out the hot tub
Always steak and lobsters, smokin' on them choppers
Pimpin' through the boulevard, back to the avenue
Good vibe attitude, I ain't even mad at you
Matter of fact, that song's filled with some graditude
I just appreciate the time that I had with you
Now I'm in and out your life like a robbery
Got me on the road, til I'm gettin' paid properly
And I can tell that you're still so proud of me
An ache that never get your corazon out of me
So lil' mamma, I'm a always be your handyman
Give me a call when I'm a ready for some Candyman

[Bridge: Bionic]
Oh yeah
I've got a friend

[Verse 1: Kev Nish {Kev Nish slowed down}]
Picture me
Rollin' in my drop top
Me and my girl
Bumpin' the
Oldies with the homies
We on top of the world
This be
West coast ridin'
In the flyest two seater
With the fast low leader
So the hood's over heated
Candy painted whip
Doin' kisses on tip
I'm a lowridin' ruler
Burnin' rubber with my chick
On a California roll
Double 0 to 6-4
So I gotta drive slow when I'm
{Sittin' on chrome}
Chorus: Bionic
However far away
I will always love you
However long I stay
I will always love you
However far away
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you

[Verse 2: Prohgress {Prohgress slowed down}]
You my ride-or-die chick
You keep my engine runnin'
You ain't picking up the phone
Even though your friends buggin'
But ain't nothin' when we touchin'
Ain't hearing nobody
In the backseat
Legs up
{Windows all foggy}
We ain't riding on blades
And I needn't all change
You ain't never seen nothin'
You just ridin' our way
And that's why I'm gonna stay with ya
{Stay with ya}
You ain't gotta
Worry about a thing, we could
Take a picture (Take a picture)
Yeah
Repeat Chorus

Repeat Break

[Verse 3: J-Splif]
Better step, to the side
Cause I'm gunnin' for the prize
I'm the number one contender here
To make the girl, mine
She's a diva, not a skeezer
Just a hot, senorita
And she makes my heart thump
Like some twenty-inch speakers
Once you wrapped around my arm
You could be my lucky charm
I'm a certified, pimp
And I got it goin' on
I'm addicted to you, girl
Need my fix, everyday
I ain't tryin' to rehab
Got you runnin' through my veins

Repeat Chorus

[Bionic]
"Whenever I'm alone with you"

[Tra-Knox]
Ooooooooo- gotta know ya
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
All right fellas- let's do it

[Verse 1]
Yo ma, we got this thing right? (Thing right)
It's like, makin' me think like (Think like)
It's like fillin' my heart up
Not makin' me hazy, just
Fillin' my mind up with all of these maybes
I'm trying to figure exactly the thing
It's like, got me wreckin' my brain
It's like, tryin' to put words to a smile (Smile, smile)
But like, trying to figure out, forget it- look
It's really kinda hard to explain
How ya smile been burnt in my brain (Oh ya)
And how ya purfume sing a sexy song to my nose
And how ya finger tips gentle like the petales of roses
Maybe it's the way you comb your hair (Comb your hair)
Or maybe it's them stylish cloths you wear (Style you wear)
Or maybe it's them little things you do
Or maybe it's just you (Maybe just you)

[Chorus]
Maybe it's your attitude (Attitude)
Maybe it's your point of veiw (Point of veiw)
Mabye it's the time we spend together (Together)
Mabye we could do this thing forever
Mabye it's your soldier ways (Soldier ways)
Mabye it's your golden gaze (Golden gaze)
Maybe it's the way we blend together (Together)
Maybe we should do this thing forever

[Verse 2]
Remember we met with shakin' T-shirt that first night?
That was the worst night, right?
Well, I mean, we had fun and all, ya, that's true
But you had somebody else and I did too
So it felt like karma and fate had formed a team
To keep me from the girl of my dreams
But in the end, I made friends with hope and destiny
And then, well, the rest is history
But yo, it wasn't easy though, trust
I mean, tryin' to turn you and me into us
You my hommie, my lover, my best friend
The White House to the ghetto
You blend right in and I dig that
I could never imagine this passion I feel
I mean, couldn't imagine it could last what I feel
But if somebody do something to you?
Shoooot, girl I might just.....

[Chorus]

[Tra-Knox]
I must tell you how I love you
Maybe your my soul-mate
Maybe my best friend
You made me and molded me
A better man, yes I can believe in love
Ooo ya ya ya, maybe, maybe, maybe
No, no, no, no

[Chorus]

Calming my nerves, no regular weed
Or somebody's shorty wit me, on her knees

Come test me get that revolver, ya messy just like a mobster

I got money on money on money on money
On top of more money, on top of my shit like flies
Open that Ferrari F-5 like eyes
Bumpin' down Ocean Drive
Jumpin out that Maybach with a bitch
Went back to tease them thighs
She gotta tattoo on her booty and it said 305
DJ Khaled say it's a movie now, don't forget your lines
'Cause you don't want me to edit, before we roll them credits
Bitch, give me my credit, I'm so energetic
I'm fucking like a rabbit, smoking on lettuce
Whatever I want I get it, I meant it if I said
And I say I keep a pump, and I ain't talking unleaded
If you want it come get it, cause boy I'm ready

Got two bitches, one peanut butter one jelly
I'm an american gangsta, already and I'm an American superstar

I got guns for the snitches, roses for the bitches
Hop up out the whip, paparazzi taking pictures

Money cash flow, all big face hunneds
Stuntin' on the pole, got them D-boys runnin'
Shorty got both broke, can't see what's comin'
Wear them apple bottoms, wear them apple bottoms honey
Dolce and Gabbana, and she get it from her mommy
Louis bag kit, Gucci, Fendi and Armani
See them karats on her wrist, now she pimp Bugs Bunny
Used to date Kanye, now she want me
Flo Rida got the juice, wanna take my OJ
It ain't her birthday but her name on the cake
If I ever pay for nookie grade A

[Verse 3: Flo Rida]
Hey!
My third flo' stuck on the hoodrat shone
Cut, take one, Hollyhood act on
Short tennis skirt, now she got me in the zone
Tattoo tight work, bought the "Low" ringtone
Plenty ghetto booty, plenty ghetto booty on her
Roll up with kitties, don't smoke Arizona
One night stand, one night with the clan
One night, one time broke her off ten grand
Project all the way, gutter all day
Pure uncut, stain wall with a J
Shorty don't fake, she'll put it in your face
Three stories by them hoodrat's beg

Got you stuck (Yeah) on my elevator (Uh-huh)
Get it up (Yeah) on my elevator - check it out!

[Intro]
She had Hennessy hips, and Belve' eyes
Grey Goose on her lips, and cognac thighs
I'm hungover (Hungover) from Ms. Hangover (Hangover)
She had a bubble like Cris', Patron all night
Had one mo' sip, too drunk to drive
I'm hungover (Hungover) from Ms. Hangover (Hangover)

[Verse 1]
Hey hey hey shorty, took me to tipsy from sober
Looked at me so fatigued, I must be her soldier
Hopin' she wouldn't tease and get in my Rover
Lil' momma you got to breathe like diamonds supposed ta
Come closer, can I hold ya, just what I need
Like my Gucci loafers, hold the, disappointment
Must be sealed inside
Bowlegged woman, that's what I need, I don't mind
Like how she flaunt it, see that's my speed, she a dime
Thought for a moment, how could this be so fine?
Body bangin', I lay the language, that walk is famous
The proper anus like she was painted
She got me tainted, I gotta brang it, this woman dangerous
None other, who's her lover? This above her
Get it from her mother, did it to her brother
Magazine cover, glad to meet a hustler
Shorty, whassup? She had...

[Chorus]
She had Hennessy hips, and Belve' eyes
Grey Goose on her lips, and cognac thighs
I'm hungover (Hungover) from Ms. Hangover (Hangover)
She had a bubble like Cris', Patron all night
Had one mo' sip, too drunk to drive
I'm hungover (Hungover) from Ms. Hangover (Hangover)

[Verse 2]
Hey parking lot pimpin', yeah, that's the way I approached her
Hips went up and down like a roller coaster
Miss got her attention, tapped her on the shoulder
Serious, she the business and I need closure
So hood and I'm startin', I'm blowin' see no stuck up trumpin'
Bugari, I'm good and I smell like the fragrance of money
I'm sorry this lady take over just like a tsunami
She had on the Jacob, I'm rockin' my platinum my money
This ain't your normal every day, baby
The type to drive nothin' less than that 600 Mercedes
It's rare that you find a woman so vicious on the daily
That grant all your wishes with looks to kill like a .380
I feel like she put me under a spell
Pretty ambitious about delicious full attention on the yell
Shorty ridiculous, I had a mission to conquer the gal
I put her on my tab, had her sippin', call a cab

[Chorus]
She had Hennessy hips, and Belve' eyes
Grey Goose on her lips, and cognac thighs
I'm hungover (Hungover) from Ms. Hangover (Hangover)
She had a bubble like Cris', Patron all night
Had one mo' sip, too drunk to drive
I'm hungover (Hungover) from Ms. Hangover (Hangover)

Damn it, I'm proud to buy my own bag of weed (My weed)

'Cause in my hood, e'ry nigga gotta eat

[Verse 1]
I know where I come from, niggas got it rough
Penny-pinchin for paper 'til you poppin big bucks
Give it up, load it cock it, ain't no tellin with them thugs
Dealers straight out the projects only felons that'll bust
Some shit you don't discuss, snitches they get {fucked up}
Damn it I'm proud to buy my own bag to fill my dutch
Planted my own seed, not a month without a bud
Granted I got to feed you we don't pump the same blood
You need that new Mercedes, home of the color gravy
How the hell you gon' pay me I made it did it .380
Tell me I'm acting shady I try to ignore the lazy
Say my grace on the daily if not arrest me I'm ready

[Chorus]
Damn it, I'm proud to buy my own bag of weed (My weed)
Found me a ho to help plant my seed (My seed)

'Cause in my hood, e'ry nigga's gotta eat
'Cause in my hood, e'ry nigga gotta eat

[Verse 2]
Chowder had-ta, dinner platter, mills/meals on deck
Cash comin', that currency to earn that respect
Money machines measurin', makin' sure you collect
Roll in the dice game you better be stoppin' bets
Keep it movin' like chess, look for your new address
Proof of ghetto success, that Bentley Coupe is correct
Go from failure to fruitful, your label, momma impressed
Done for whoever knew you, supported you through the stress
That drama on the block, all them run-ins with cops
Couldn't afford shoes, was happy two pair of socks
Steady payin' your dues that landed you in the box
Other niggas confused, you asked them to borrow crop

[Chorus]
Damn it, I'm proud to buy my own bag of weed (My weed)
Found me a ho to help plant my seed (My seed)
I got bail money they fuck with me (With me)

[Bridge]
Cryin e'yday, big franks on they brain
Properly marinate a million strong, keep the change
Cheddar that generate, we gotta tote it with a crane
Hustlers for that bank, be aware that we untamed
Ducats, we deranged, muscle the damn thang
Militia off in the hood, come get you that's point blank
Hit you it's all good, business before a dame
Women tell us he'd never survive in that cheddar lane
You see we want it all, yeah we breakin the law
Buy it sell it cook it that's on everythang if it's raw
Anyway you put it, to the folks we breakin the law
Sing it so I took it and if you tell a nigga that's all

[Chorus]
Damn it, I'm proud to buy my own bag of weed (My weed)
Found me a ho to help plant my seed (My seed)
I got bail money they fuck with me (With me)

Legs up on my shoulders, if you want, I'll bend you over
Climb on top of me, it's over, let you ride me, ride me

Wife beater on, VIP, like the eye of the storm
I'm project, I'm ghetto, hood, better ring the alarm
Cold flu, cause I just blew 30 off cash
Blue with my swag, that's that Gucci duffle bag
Goops coming through I got sparklers on the mag
Flo Rida act a fool, have a furniture attack
Well cause I'm young gettin' money
Homeboy in Phantoms and Lac's
I'm in the club with my King Johnny's them diamonds is black
Shorty she lovin' my tattoos ingrained on my back
Muggin' and thuggin' the trap crew we step like Da Brat
Married the rubberbands, hustlin', hustlin'
Got a squad gutter man, so we musclin', musclin'
Security guard, touch the clan, then we, tusslin', tusslin'
Tear apart, hit the fan, now they runnin' and duckin'

I gotta be fly like Kid Rock-in that derby with the feather
That good in the sky, got the kush from Cali control the weather
So hood, so hot, so what? Security wanna ban my record
Some fools on this sofa open up on the Oprah Winfrey show
It's no pressure
My crew full of dubs and we stunt like dollaz come with propellars
Everybody gotta grub in my pockets, gettin' paper is pleasure
Homie don't you f'n with heffers that square me up like checkers
And I might undress her all just because my diamonds caress her
Meet uncle fester, ballin', my shawties they hot as peppers
Don't know how to act I got stack full of mice looking for cheddar
Down for whatever, hey!
I'm a donut nigga like glazed
On a couch like this my stage
Get money, don't get a nigga paid in Dade...
They probably see minimum wage
My deal is Ace of Spades, but I still like grape Kool-aid
I ain't really got minutes, I party just like a rave!

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Shawty had them Apple Bottom jeans (Jeans), boots with the fur (With the fur)
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the flo' (She hit the flo'), next thing you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low
Them baggy sweat pants and the Reeboks with the straps (With the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (Ayy!)
She hit the flo' (She hit the flo'), next thing you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Hey, I ain't never seen nothin' that'll make me go
This crazy all night spendin' my dough
Had a million dollar vibe and a bottle to go
Them birthday cakes they stole the show
So sexual, she was flexible
Professional, drinkin' X and O
Hold up, wait a minute, do I see what I think I, whoa
Did I think I see shawty get low?
Ain't the same when it's up that close
Make it rain, I'm makin' it snow
Work the pole, I got the bank roll
I'ma say that I prefer them no clothes
I'm into that, I love women exposed
She threw it back at me, I gave her mo'
Cash ain't no problem, I know where it goes
She had them

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Apple Bottom jeans (Jeans), boots with the fur (With the fur)
The whole club was lookin' at her

Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
Hey, shawty, what I gotta do to get you home?
My jeans full of guap and they ready for shones
Cadillacs, Maybachs for the sexy groan
Patron on the rocks that'll make you moan
One stack c'mon, two stacks c'mon
Three stacks c'mon, now that's three grand
What, you think I'm playin', baby girl?
I'm the man, I invented rubber bands
That's what I told her, her legs on my shoulder
I knew it was over, that Henny and Cola
Got me like a soldier, she ready for Rover
I couldn't control her
So lucky oh me, I was just like a clover
Shawty was hot like a toaster
Sorry but I had to fold her
Like a pornography poster, she showed her

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Apple Bottom jeans (Jeans), boots with the fur (With the fur)
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the flo' (She hit the flo'), next thing you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low

She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (Ayy!)
She hit the flo' (She hit the flo'), next thing you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low

[Verse 3: Flo Rida]
Whoa, shawty
Yeah she was worth the money
Lil' mama took my cash
And I ain't want it back
The way she bent that back
Got her them paper stacks
Tattoo above her crack
I had to handle that
I was on it, sexy woman
Let me showin' and made me want it
Two in the mornin', I'm zonin'
And them Rosay bottles foamin'
She wouldn't stop, made it drop
Shawty did that pop and lock
Had to break her off that guap
Gal was fly just like my Glock

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Apple Bottom jeans (Jeans), boots with the fur (With the fur)
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the flo' (She hit the flo'), next thing you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low

She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (Ayy!)
She hit the flo' (She hit the flo'), next thing you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low (Come on)

[Intro]
My lawnmower home, but my ho still missin'
My ho still missin', my ho still missin'
My rake in the shed, but my ho still missin'
My ho still missin', my ho still missin'
Plowin' the world but my ho still missin'
My ho still missin', my ho still missin'
I'm 'bout to lose my head 'cause my ho still missin'
Like it's greener on the other side...

[Verse 1]
I take care of the yard, every day
I don't know why my ho gon' missin'
My rake in good condition, my lawnmower in position
I ain't done a damn thing wrong for my ho to get up and get missin'
Now I'd be wrong if I was to dig up the dirt
I done saw for myself and witnessed
Boy, I'd tell you about my ho, never had restrictions
I guess more green was her attention
I shoulda kept that ho in the kitchen
Got me on a mission, left my shed without permission
I'm sheddin' tears, messin' up my vision
This ho gon' make me go to prison

[Chorus]
My lawnmower home, but my ho still missin'
My ho still missin', my ho still missin'
My rake in the shed, but my ho still missin'
My ho still missin', my ho still missin'
Plowin' the world but my ho still missin'
My ho still missin', my ho still missin'
I'm 'bout to lose my head 'cause my ho still missin'
Like it's greener on the other side...

[Verse 2]
That ho cost me my job
I'm afraid I shoulda learned mo' 'bout the business
A ho is good for diggin'
I shoulda known this from the beginnin'
I done got caught slippin', now I'm trippin
Out the do', somebody else found interest
On my ho until I found out until I find out different
Better to know then have intuitions
Who been in my yard? Why would anybody split us apart?
I never thought that ho would get to my heart
I found out right off a bitch can't pull apart
Why this ho went in somebody garage?
I was a gentlemen right from the start
Ever since I put the ho in my Dodge
Now this bitch won't even spare me the rod

[Chorus]
My lawnmower home, but my ho still missin'
My ho still missin', my ho still missin'
My rake in the shed, but my ho still missin'
My ho still missin', my ho still missin'
Plowin' the world but my ho still missin'
My ho still missin', my ho still missin'
I'm 'bout to lose my head 'cause my ho still missin'
Like it's greener on the other side...

[Bridge]
Seven years now, it's all over
Now hold on go on, you gotta feel me, bruh
Left my home no sign of luck
I try to drink Patron so all the memories gone
All the pain, I'm trying to pour it in my cup
Bought the ho my last couple of bucks
Lost a ho, I never felt this crush, like kush in a dutch
Never this much
If I woulda known my ho was just temporary
And I ain't talkin 'bout the ho you find in the dictionary
I feel like goin' to war like the military
Somebody gon' have to visit the cemetery

[Outro]
My lawnmower home, but my ho still missin'
My ho still missin', my ho still missin'
My rake in the shed, but my ho still missin'
My ho still missin', my ho still missin'
Plowin' the world but my ho still missin'
My ho still missin', my ho still missin'
I'm 'bout to lose my head 'cause my ho still missin'
Like it's greener on the other side...

We need to be together
You ain't gon' find you nothin' better

Baby you under pressure
All of them Italian leathers
All them gifts on the reg'lar
Brand new Phantom umbrella

We even got matchin' perfume and cologne, girl
Ain't no other nigga gon' be touchin' your thong, girl
You mine, ain't no denyin'
Even witness me cryin', take some time to rewind

Not my soul, like we be callin' black fool
I mean damn who knows, you prolly fucked another dude
I gave you that rose, that ring when I proposed to you
Got rid of my gold teeth, cause your mom and them, oops
And shot at them fools who touched your brother, now Boo
And now you gon' tell me we should slow it down, who
Not Flo Rida, I provided Campbells' soup
When sick 'bout to die, I spoon-fed you Theraflu
You gotsa be high, woman, I ain't 'bout to lose
Get out this house, I pay tuition on ya school
I mean to my knowledge, until the end it's Me and You

[Intro: Birdman]
Right about now, yeah (So fresh)
So fresh... whatup Flo?

[Chorus: Flo Rida]
I pulled up to the club on dubs
They say look at them go, look at them go
And raised up with some girls tryin' to cut
Three times in a row, times in a row
'Cause I spent twenty on my tires, thirty to be icy
But me bein' fly, that's priceless
And I gave forty to my side chick, fifty to the wifey
But me bein' fly, that's priceless, baby, that's priceless

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
I'm straight up out the projects, hustlin' that's the object
If ye ain't talkin' cash, then you better switch the topic
Bitch nigga stop it, gon' ahead and cop it
Money in the bag, call it takin' out the garbage
I know them boys snitchin' cause they're scared of first degree
But you can tell them F-E-D's I'm in V.I.P
With four mill' cheddar, yeah, he keep Florida Keys
The window to the wall they supply you what you need
Got no wife, but the wife be my girlfriend
My girlfriend girlfriend lookin' for a girlfriend
Nick name tailspin, leave you in a whirlwind
One hit away, now they askin' where the world went?

[Chorus: Flo Rida]
I pulled up to the club on dubs
They say look at them go, look at them go
And raised up with some girls tryin' to cut
Three times in a row, times in a row
'Cause I spent twenty on my tires, thirty to be icy
But me bein' fly, that's priceless
And I gave forty to my side chick, fifty to the wifey
But me bein' fly, that's priceless
Baby, that's priceless

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
I'm so fly, not to mention that I'm priceless
Ye ain't never seen heard or felt nothin like this
Thousand dollar jeans, Air Force Two Nikes
Whylin' in the club, give a fuck about indictments
'Scuse me bartender but the drinks are on me
Two magnums in my hand, one for creeps, one for freaks
Too much legal tender so it's rainin' bubbly
My ice the same color what Kelis hair used to be
Hold up, wait a min-ute
Popeye niggas ain't eatin' they spinach
I made to make dollars so it have to make sense
I'm pourin' out liquor for my dead presidents
All of 'em dead, all of 'em die
Toetag money, see it fallin' out the sky
Bitch, if I ain't priceless, then bury me alive
My pockets like caskets, death live inside

[Chorus: Flo Rida]
I pulled up to the club on dubs
They say look at them go, look at them go
And raised up with some girls tryin' to cut
Three times in a row, times in a row
'Cause I spent twenty on my tires, thirty to be icy
But me bein' fly, that's priceless
And I gave forty to my side chick, fifty to the wifey
But me bein' fly, that's priceless
Baby, that's priceless

[Verse 3: Birdman]
Sheeeit, alligator with the suede
Fifty on the carpet, all yellow hard eggs
Scarface white leather
Purple kush green, all red shinin' any weather
Customized Jeep
Fo' a high priced life nigga, get it 'til you can't no mo'
Shop 'til you can't no mo', ten on some new shoes
Fifty on that boy, hundred on some new jewels
And give a fuck about the price
Precious little tight, blew hard on the mic
She'll get your whole life homey
For a stack, do you somethin' right, homey

[Chorus: Flo Rida]
I pulled up to the club on dubs
They say look at them go, look at them go
And raised up with some girls tryin' to cut
Three times in a row, times in a row
'Cause I spent twenty on my tires, thirty to be icy
But me bein' fly, that's priceless
And I gave forty to my side chick, fifty to the wifey
But me bein' fly, that's priceless
Baby, that's priceless

[Intro/Chorus: Flo Rida & Carmen Michelle Key]
You know I know how
To make 'em stop and stare as I zone out
The club can't even handle me right now
Watchin' you watchin' me, I go all out
The club can't even handle me right now
(Eh, yea-ei-yeaaah, eh, yea-ei-yeaaah, eh, yea-yeaaaah)
The club can't even handle me right now
(Eh, yea-ei-yeaaah, eh, yea-ei-yeaaah, eh, yea-yeaaaah)
Haha! Can't nothin' handle me right now!
I see you, D. Guetta, let's get 'em!

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Hey
I own the night and I don't need no help
Gotta be the feeling that Scarface felt
Stuntin' gone wild, can't handle this playa
Life of the club arrogant like yeah
Talk like money so the girls just melt
One too many, all on me like twelve
Look like cash and they all just stare
Bottles, models, standin' on chairs
Ball out 'cause that's the business
All out, it's so ridiculous
Zone out, so much attention
Scream out, I'm in the building, hey!
They watchin', I know this
I'm rockin', I'm rollin'
I'm holdin', I know it, you know it

[Chorus: Flo Rida & Carmen Michelle Key]
You know I know how
To make 'em stop and stare as I zone out
The club can't even handle me right now
Watchin' you watchin' me, I go all out
The club can't even handle me right now
(Eh, yea-ei-yeaaah, eh, yea-ei-yeaaah, eh, yea-yeaaaah)
The club can't even handle me right now
(Eh, yea-ei-yeaaah, eh, yea-ei-yeaaah, eh, yea-yeaaaah)

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
Hey
Still feelin' myself, I'm like outta control
Can't stop now, more shots, let's go
Ten more rounds, can I get a K.O.?
Paparazzi tryna make me pose
Came to party 'til I can't no more
Celebrate 'cause that's all I know
Tip the groupies takin' off they clothes
Grand finale like Super Bowl
Go hard, I run the show
That's right, wild out, got money to blow
More lights, more ice, when I walk in the door
No hype, do it big all over the globe
Yeah! I said it, go tell it
Confetti, who ready?
I'm ready! You ready? Let's get it!

[Chorus: Flo Rida & Carmen Michelle Key]
You know I know how
To make 'em stop and stare as I zone out
The club can't even handle me right now
Watchin' you watchin' me, I go all out
The club can't even handle me right now
(Eh, yea-ei-yeaaah, eh, yea-ei-yeaaah, eh, yea-yeaaaah)
(Put your hands up!)
(Put your hands up!)
(Put your hands up!)
The club can't even handle me right now
(Eh, yea-ei-yeaaah, eh, yea-ei-yeaaah, eh, yea-yeaaaah)
(Put your hands up!)
(Put your hands up!)
(Put your hands up!)

[Bridge: Flo Rida]
You got me watchin' now (Yeah)
Got my attention now (Yeah)
Got everybody in the club wantin' to know now
I am a ladies' man, come and be my lady and
We can ball, so, ahh!
Bring ya body here, let me switch up ya atmosphere
Take you out of the club and up in my new Lear (Yeah)
Fly you all around the world
Whatchu want, baby girl?
Are you ready to go, now?

[Chorus: Flo Rida & Carmen Michelle Key]
You know I know how
To make 'em stop and stare as I zone out
The club can't even handle me right now
Watchin' you watchin' me, I go all out
The club can't even handle me right now
(Eh, yea-ei-yeaaah, eh, yea-ei-yeaaah, eh, yea-yeaaaah)

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
Hey, I've got a mouth full of cavities
Sweet tooth, full of mama, like sugar to me
So my love with the lips, put a bug in the ear tone
Shawty gotta kiss, it's an emergency
Spit sprung for the taste, addicted to her gloss
Won't smile this way, baby, I rub it off
Put my tongue in your face
A little mistletoe, sippin' Gran Marnier
I'm a fan all day
Do me that favor, 'cause I like your flavor
My manage behavior; I'm into your major
Sweeter so flavor, that's good for this player
My hood, now and later, throw back like a pager
Pretty much, you're givin' me a sugar rush
Lil mama, give me high blood pressure when you blush
Lips feel soft as a feather when we touch
Shawty that's what's up

Bottom and top lip, 'bout to have a sugar feast
Level with our trip, I'm a lip bitin' beast
Smile for them things, all 42 teeth
Squeeze the sugar cane on your mouth, must beat
Ain't your mama slirp, stickin', usin' my tree
Like taffy but classy, get at me

Hey, okay lil mama, I know your kind and I like 'em grown

[Chorus: Pleasure P]
Can you be my action?
'Cause from the way that you're dancin'

Baby, you can be my action

You can be my action, plenty satisfaction
I really got a fetish, she bowlegged, that's my attraction
Set it off there, baby, with the blackberry that's my collection
What it do on everything that sexiness is my passion
Whatever you like, we turn off the lights
Go'head 'n show me your back strong
The end of the night, if you get me right
Got stacks to blow like a saxophone
Do ya thang, mama, keep killin' 'em
Dead presidents, I'm peelin' 'em
For the record, I'm feelin' ya, no contest, shorty, keep grillin' 'em
All the way, all day
Don't play, get straight to the point, raise the temperature
So hot, celebrate, girl
I just wanna give you this cake, let's get physical
Baddest in the club, how you do that, baby? You too much
Just my luck, let me touch, be director, let me cut

[Chorus: Pleasure P]
Can you be my action?
Cause from the way that you're dancin'
I know you got it goin' on tonight
Baby, you can be my action
And I'll turn on the lights and the cameras as soon as I can get you home tonight

You can be my, you can be my - we shonin'
Baby, you can be my action

[Verse 3: Pleasure P]
I live in Hollywood, but I still be in the 'jects
Shawties wanna holla when they see what's on my neck
My money very long, I ain't gotta make it stretch
And when I say shone, I be talkin' 'bout sex
Say little mama you know I'ma make you holla
Walk in the club and we gon' toss a couple dollas
Pop a few bottles, make them hatas wanna follow
Ain't nothin' wrong, you grown, so baby, can you be my

[Chorus: Pleasure P]

'Cause from the way that you're dancin', I know you got it goin' on tonight

Girl on the floor, all her friends around her
I mean real clean, ain't gotta touch or nothing
It ain't like I like a chick on chick or something

Why is it that when y'all see me at the party
Y'all be looking like 'Ooo he's a movie star
He ain't supposed to be out on the floor with everybody'
But oh wait, whoa y'all forgetting
When I was, amateur spitting before the scripts were written
First one in, last one out the club
Bursting in, passing out in the club
Back at it, this cat is the wit and the charm
Taking you higher like a syringe hittin ya arm
Bringing the fire, making you Benz ring the alarm
Let me see you clap, spin baby come on
Switch!

Oh you just gonna stand there huh?
What you too cute to dance? Or you scared?
It ain't really that hard to do and
I ain't trying to be in love with you and
All I wanted was a moment or two to
See if you could do that Switch-a-roo and
Shut your mouth fool, get your crew and
The thick body and the rear one too and
I'll be right here waiting on you to
See if y'all can do that Switch-a-roo
(Heeeeeeeeeeeeey, heeeeeeeeeeeeey)

That's what I'm talking bout, do that thing mama

He's a nice guy - how ya doin?
He's a nice guy - good to see ya!
He's a nice guy - how your mom an' 'em?

[Verse 1]
Mr. Nice Guy, relationship advice guy
Light on the vices, priceless smile
Look at the eyes, got the look
Of a survivor, husband, father
Dissed by Eminem, but did it bother him?
Yup, but he classy
Big Will just did another 20 mill', walk right past E
I'm a nice guy, why y'all harassin me, huh?
On the radio they be over-exaggeratin
So blase with they lies, they be aggravatin me
Agitatin me, but they be waitin and hatin
And they be makin me crazy but I be takin it patiently
People be messin with me, testin me, f'n with me
I wanna send a message to 'em, teach 'em a lesson quickly
They publically addressin me, disrespectin me heavily
They better be lucky the way my blessings affected me, but
{*deep breath*} Calm down Willie
You don't wanna go drop the bomb now Willie
Keep a nice flow for your mom down in Philly
On the news you go if you blow and act silly, y'know?

[Hook]
He's a nice guy - how ya doin?
He's a nice guy - good to see ya!
He's a nice guy - sometimes y'all
Mistake nice for soft, so I before I go off I just

[Will Smith]
RAH RAH RAH RAH RAH RAH RAH RAH

[Verse 2]
Will's a nice guy, why he's so nice I'd
Let him date my daughter like he was a white guy
Not like the rest, he's a private flight guy
Why, if I were gay on Friday night I'd...
Larry Elder - Uncle Tom?
You're lucky I ain't make you the whole damn rhyme
Wendy Williams, you don't know me
I'm not your punchin bag, you gon' blow me
Up, girl, better leave me alone
Before I buy your radio station and send you home
Yo, it's a warnin shot over the bow
Truth be told, this ain't my style
You gotta understand some stuff a man can't allow
You better chill 'fore you climb a tree you can't get down
Okay - people dissing Will sat on a wall
People dissing Will had a great fall
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put none of their careers together again
You get it?

[Hook]
He's a nice guy - how ya doin?
He's a nice guy - good to see ya!
He's a nice guy - sometimes y'all
Mistake nice for soft, so I before I go off I just
He's a nice guy - how ya doin?
He's a nice guy - good to see ya!
He's a nice guy - sometimes y'all
Mistake nice for soft, so I before I go off I just

[Outro]
RAH RAH RAH RAH RAH RAH RAH RAH

[Verse 1]
It's all good, pop the bubbly, life is lovely
All sun no rain
No strain, can't complain
Pass Hell pain, but no Kum-Ba-Yah
Now I Boomshaka-laka-laka Boo-ah-ah
I got the good life, no strife, real nice
An I'm a papa my son Trey haha
An when I'm on tour, he be mad I'm gone
But then he smile an come runnin screamin "daddy's home"
Then he hold me, slightly tightly
Mom, your wish came true-I got one just like me
My life be so good, so good
Ka-chicka-chicka Ka-chicka-chicka-good
Things come to those who wait
But too late, my life's to great to wait
I wanna celebrate
Good times, c'mon

[Chorus]
Livin', lovin', lovin' livin', it's all good
I'm lovin' livin', it's all good
Livin', lovin', lovin' livin', it's all good
I'm lovin' livin', it's all good
Livin', lovin', lovin' livin', it's all good
I'm lovin' livin', it's all good
Livin', lovin', lovin' livin', it's all good
I'm lovin' livin', it's all good

[Verse 2]
I wake up every morning in the canopy bed
Slip a kiss to the Miss, you the man she says
Mirror, mirror, need I call?
You know, uno, bad breath an all
Times I been fed up, still didn't let up
'Stead a doin dirt, did work and kept my head up
Set up
For the future, much love to my girl
North Pole got my butt cold (sittin on top of the world)
An I'm feelin (so high)
Touch the ceiling (the sky)
You say I smile cause I'm on top of the pie
But yo, the cream can only finance the smile for a little while
My grin got longevity, got family backin me
That's why I'm livin happily
Ever after, love and laughter
Hussle cause I wants to, not cause I have to
Ask yourself, who made the polar caps melt?
FP, the phenomenon, true Don Juan, Jon Blaze
The Fonz ain't seen my Happy Days
The track plays, I'm in the shades, singin a phrase

[Chorus]
Livin', lovin', lovin' livin', it's all good
I'm lovin' livin', it's all good
Livin', lovin', lovin' livin', it's all good
I'm lovin' livin', it's all good
Livin', lovin', lovin' livin', it's all good
I'm lovin' livin', it's all good
Livin', lovin', lovin' livin', it's all good
I'm lovin' livin', it's all good

[Verse 3]
They say the clothes don't make the man, take my hand
Watch me freak this, hot mommies tryna creep this
Sleep with this, tryna entice me to let it off
But nah (why not?,) c'mon baby, you saw "Set It Off"
Proposition by a trio in Rio
Ménage à trois down at the Marde Gras
But nah, my clothes by Versace
My attitude cocky, The scent, Issy Miyaki
Like a felon, no tellin what I do next
I don't front cause I'm paid, but I do flex
Southwestern, crib like a villa
Vacation on a mountain in Manilla
Rhyme spilla, real thrilla
An it's real clear
Y'all talkin East and West, I'm talkin hemispheres
My papa raised no fool
So many zeros on my check it's like, "ooooooooooooooooo"

[Chorus]
Livin', lovin', lovin' livin', it's all good
I'm lovin' livin', it's all good
Livin', lovin', lovin' livin', it's all good
I'm lovin' livin', it's all good
Livin', lovin', lovin' livin', it's all good
I'm lovin' livin', it's all good
Livin', lovin', lovin' livin', it's all good
I'm lovin' livin', it's all good

[Intro]
This one goes out to all the big willies

[Verse 1: Will Smith]
Big Will the high roller
Strolling through with an entourage
Hard to camouflage when you living this large
I be smooth like Debarge with a five car garage
Out for the night with my squad
And we be flossing down the fifteen
My whole aura gleaming
Who that kid in the green V?
Envy brother scheming
I ain't thinking bout them
Racing chicks in the pink b.m
With my speakers tweakin'
Freaking off this weekend
In Las Vegas, boss players all across the board
Move makers and shakers
Money can't break us but the places it can take us
Big will in the limelight, rhyme tight
And we gon' have some fun tonight

[Hook: Will Smith]
Now how we do it?
(You know it's Big Willie style baby)
How we doing it?
(You know it's Big Willie style)

Now how we do it?
(You know it's Big Willie style baby)
How we doing it?
(You know it's Big Willie style)

[Verse 2: Will Smith]
I'm in a five star casino shutting crap tables down (boom)
Non betting willie watchers standing around
Strictly millionaire status you can feel the eyes looking at us
How bad they wanna be us (parlay)
Charlie Mack got my back with his eyes on my stack
Brothers don't know how to act when you drive a four-five black
People stop and stare having drinks at the bar
A round for everybody with these big willie cards
From civilians to stars they wanna know who we are
It's me big Will, Nas, Escobar, J.L. Omar
Carry money bags collect the chips then we all quick to swift exit

[Hook: Will Smith]
Now how we do it?
(You know it's Big Willie style baby)
How we doing it?
(You know it's Big Willie style)
Now how we do it?
(You know it's Big Willie style baby)
How we doing it?
(You know it's Big Willie style)

[Verse 3: Left Eye]
It's Left Eye with a tight crew
Representing like it's ladies night
Coming right through
Don't be spiteful
Plus an eyeful, Sporting hot pink
Rocks in the link, In the drop with a mink
Like my- don't stink
Got you in the palm with a bomb like Saddam
Blowing up spots then running off with the pot
Left Eye ready for action
The main attraction
I'm in the fast lane passing
Breaking you down like fractions
While we be rapping about things that really happen
Big willie style Philly style let's make it platinum
With Mademoiselle from Gezals to Versace
With a sweet smell
This female leading the posse
Got jokes like Cosby
In the lots where the cars be
With no apologies it's Left Eye
Big Will, let the champagne spill
Is it a man's thing for real?
Can us girls roll wit y'all
What the deal?

[Hook: Will Smith]
Now how we do it?
(You know it's Big Willie style baby)
How we doing it?
(You know it's Big Willie style)

Now how we do it?
(You know it's Big Willie style baby)
How we doing it?
(You know it's Big Willie style)

[Verse 4: Will Smith]
Well now it's looking like a car show
Convoys and whips on the strip
Pulling up in the six making brothers sick
For real
Big Will household name, Entertainer
Gold handle cane and matching gators
Swerving lane
In pole position rolling deep like a coalition
In soul position and can rock a whole convention
Movie screens to the club scene
My whole crew looking clean
Shine with a diamond gleam
Step above where the players be
Don't hate me
One is where they rate me
Lately you could find me
Behind the door marked V.I.P
Eating grapes under the A.C
Big willie style is how we do it

[Hook: Will Smith]
Now how we do it?
(You know it's Big Willie style baby)
How we doing it?
(You know it's Big Willie style)

Now how we do it?
(You know it's Big Willie style baby)
How we doing it?
(You know it's Big Willie style)

[Outro]
This one goes out to all the big willies

[Intro]
Well, Yeah
Forever, forever, forever chasing forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever, forever, forever
Forever chasing forever

[Verse 1]
Early mornin' wake up
Gently with the caress on your hand
And that kimono that I bought you on my trip to Japan
Sunshine peekin through the venetian blinds
Four years, and like wine, you got finer with time
I got a question, if the Prada dressin and the Gucci
All got goes, and the freeze on the Lucci
I mean real bad girl, I'm talking rougher than rough
Do you think it'd be enough if we just had us?
Don't answer quick, think about it cause I'm askin for real
Golddiggers goin' to hear this song drivin and crash at the wheel
Forever is a long time, so far we gettin along fine
No car I ever drove, no ice I ever saw
No music I ever made, ain't nothin I wanted more
We could deal with whatever together
Sunshine, all that other weather, when we chasin forever

[Hook]
I wanna stay with you forever
(Forever, Forever, forever)
I wanna spend all my life with only you
(Forever chasing forever)
I wanna stay, lets stay together
(Lets stay together, forever, forever)
Chasing forever, with only you
(Forever chasing forever)

[Verse 2]
Chasin forever, a buckwild, endeavorous scene
Should we pursue with somethin real or just chasin a dream
Or casin' the scene
Fore I die I plan
To see your soul and eternity in the palm of my hands
Now as a man, there's certain things I'm lackin for sure
But I'm committed to growin and coming at you mature
In the future, I know it ain't gonna be all good
But when we feelin the hurt, if we willin to work
The eight ball will never turn to see us behind
Though I ain't no knight, and my armor don't shine
My mom said the lynch pin of love is trust
An taught me monogamy is a, monoga-must
Plus, for you dinner by candlelight
Now don't commit before you sure you understand me right
It's a race to a strange place, most see never
It's a chase we gotta make together, forever

[Hook]
I wanna stay with you forever
(Forever, Forever, forever)
I wanna spend all my life with only you
(Forever chasing forever)
I wanna stay, lets stay together
(Lets stay together, forever, forever)
Chasing forever, with only you
(Forever chasing forever)

[Verse 3]
Now you would think after all my heartbreaks I'd be cruel
Hiding behind my ego, evil but no
Much the contrary, I'm very much certain
You searching for joy, it's on the other side of hurtin
Finally found a person, worthy of all
Instead of pushing me down, you wanna cushion my fall
Your eyes could make the sun rise, all the birds sing
Seal it with a kiss, bind it with a ring
More carats than even bugs could eat in a week
And the ribbon in the sky, close your eyes don't peek
I'll tell you what I see in the future
A hacienda so cute with, five little kids calling you mom and calling me dad
Having more good times than JJ had
Judging by the look in your eyes, you see it
Let no man sever, welcome to forever

[Outro]
I wanna stay with you forever
(Forever, Forever, forever)
I wanna spend all my life with only you
(Each and every day forever chasing forever)
I wanna stay, lets stay together
(Forever, forever together)
Chasing forever, with only you
(Forever chasing forever)
I wanna stay with you forever
(Forever, Forever, forever)
I wanna spend all my life with only you
(Forever chasing forever, only you)
I wanna stay, lets stay together
(Forever, forever together don't you go no where)
Chasing forever, with only you
(Forever chasing forever)
Stay forever
(Forever, forever)
Each and every day
(Forever chasing forever)
Forever, Forever, forever
With only you
(Forever chasing forever)

[Intro: Trey Smith]
Now Dad this is a very sensitive subject

[Chorus]
Just the two of us
Just the two of us (just the two of us)
Just the two of us (just the two of us)

[Verse 1: Will Smith]
From the first time the doctor placed you in my arms
I knew I'd meet death before I'd let you meet harm
Although questions arose in my mind, would I be man enough
Against wrong, choose right and be standing up?
From the hospital that first night
Took a hour just ta get the car seat in right
People driving all fast, got me kinda upset
Got you home safe, placed you in your bassinet
That night I don't think one wink I slept
As I slipped out my bed, to your crib I crept
Touched your head gently, felt my heart melt
Cause I know I loved you more than life itself
Then to my knees, and I begged the Lord please
Let me be a good daddy, all he needs
Love, knowledge, discipline too
I pledge my life to you

[Chorus]
Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I

[Verse 2: Will Smith]
Five years old, bringin comedy
Everytime I look at you I think man, a little me
Just like me, wait an' see, gonna be tall
Makes me laugh cause you got your dads ears an all
Sometimes I wonder, what you gonna be
A general, a doctor, maybe a MC
Haha, I wanna kiss you all the time
But I will test that butt when you cut outta line, true that
Uh-uh-uh why you do that?
I try to be a tough dad, but you be makin me laugh
Crazy joy, when I see the eyes of my baby boy
I pledge to you, I will always do
Everything I can, show you how to be a man
Dignity, integrity, honor an'
I don't mind if you lose, long as you came with it
An you can cry, ain't no shame in it
It didn't work out with me an your mom
But yo, push come to shove, you was conceived in love
So if the world attacks, and you slide off track
Remember one fact, I got your back

[Chorus]
Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I

[Verse 3]
It's a full-time job to be a good dad
You got so much more stuff than I had
I gotta study just to keep with the changin times
101 Dalmations on your CD-ROM
See me-I'm tyin to pretend I know
On my PC where that CD go
But yo, ain't nothin promised, one day I'll be gone
Feel the strife, but trust life does go on
But just in case, it's my place to impart
One day some girl's gonna break your heart
And ooh ain't no pain like from the opposite sex
Gonna hurt bad, but don't take it out on the next, son
Throughout life people will make you mad
Disrespect you and treat you bad
Let God deal with the things they do
Cause hate in your heart will consume you too
Always tell the truth, say your prayers
Hold doors, pull out chairs, easy on the swears
You're living proof that dreams do come true
I love you and I'm here for you

[Chorus]
Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us, (Just the two of us)
Just the two of us, building castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Miami, uh, uh
South Beach, bringin the heat, uh
Ha-ha, can y'all feel that?
Can y'all feel that?
Jig it out, uh

[Verse 1]
Here I am, in the place where I come let go
In Miami the bass and the sunset low
Everyday like a Mardi Gras, everybody party all day
No work, all play, okay?
So we sip a little something, leave the rest to spill
Me and Charlie at the bar, runnin' up a high bill
Nothin less than ill, when we dress to kill
Every time the ladies pass, they be like, "Hi, Will!"
Can y'all feel me? All ages and races
Real sweet faces
Every different nation, Spanish, Haitian, Indian, Jamaican
Black, White, Cuban, and Asian
I only came for two days of playing
But every time I come I always wind up stayin'
This the type of town I could spend a few days in
Miami the city that keeps the roof blazin'

[Hook]
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami, bienvenido a Miami
Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn
I'm goin to Miami, welcome to Miami

[Verse 2]
Yo, I heard the rainstorms ain't nothin to mess with
But I can't feel a drip on the strip, it's a trip
Ladies half-dressed, fully equipped
And they be screamin' out, "Will, we loved your last hit!"
So I'm thinkin I'ma scoop me somethin hot
In this salsa-merengue melting pot
Hottest club in the city, and it's right on the beach
Temperature get to ya, it's about to reach
Five-hundred degrees in the Caribbean seas
With the hot mamis screaming "¡Ay, papi!"
Every time I come to town, they be spottin' me
In the drop Bentley, ain't no stoppin' me
So, cash in your dough and flow to this fashion show
Pound for pound, anywhere you go
Yo, ain't no city in the world like this
And if you ask how I know, I got's to plead the fifth

[Hook]
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami, bienvenido a Miami
Bouncin' in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn
I'm goin to Miami, welcome to Miami

[Verse 3]
Don't get me wrong, Chi-town got it goin' on
And New York is the city that we know don't sleep
And we all know that L.A. and Philly stay jiggy
But on the sneak, Miami bringin' heat for real
Y'all don't understand
I never seen so many Dominican women with cinnamon tans
Mira, this is the plan
Take a walk on the beach, draw a heart in the sand
Gimme your hand
Damn, you look sexy
Let's go to my yacht, in the West Keys
Ride my jet skis, loungin' in the palm trees
'Cause you gotta have cheese for the summerhouse piece on South Beach
Water so clear, you can see to the bottom
Hundred-thousand dollar cars, everybody got 'em
Ain't no surprise, in the club to see Sly Stallone
Miami, my second home
Miami

[Hook]
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami, bienvenido a Miami
Bouncin in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn
I'm goin to Miami, welcome to Miami
Party in the city where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn
Welcome to Miami, bienvenido a Miami
Bouncin in the club where the heat is on
All night, on the beach 'til the break of dawn
I'm goin to Miami, welcome to Miami

[Outro]
Party in the city where the heat is on

[Verse 1]
Excuse me Miss, can we chat for a second
I'd ask how you doin', but you fine I reckon
Wait, do you have a man, cause I ain't' into homewrecking
No? ...Aight cool just checking
Look, from a hundred yards you caught my eye
An all my boys said I didn't have the heart to say hi
I'd like to have your number you don't have ta give it now
But if you diss me while they lookin I'm a never live it down
Y'know what I mean, Aww damn, my name's Will
Maxine. Pleasure to meet you, look here's the deal
Can I sit? Thanks, now I don't mean to objectify
But this the metaphore that crossed my mind
You sweet, good enough to eat
Make a brother wanna TLC--Creep
A brother can't sleep
It's like a kid fallin for you
So here's my own private nickname, I'm a call you

[Hook]
Candy (no doubt, do you wanna bounce?)
It's the same feelin I always seem to get around you
Let's get this started now
Let's get this started now

[Verse 2]
I ain't gonna lie to you, I remember layin eyes on you
All I thought about was livin life beside you, Boo
All I wanna do is be the perfect guy to you
Tell you the truth, it's like (Candy) cause I'm feelin like its callin me
You're tryin ta hold on, but fallin
Seem quite far ta me
I stay strong but it's hard to be
Cause somethin bringin out the dog in me
(It's like Candy) when I'm keepin my zone
Chat on the phone, I lower my tone
Steady plottin on takin ya home
Gettin all inside of your dome, makin you moan
You shoulda known (It's like Candy)
As I'm seein you here, Mommy I know your peepin my stare
And feelin my glare, brother thinkin bout unrollin the bear
Strokin your hair, (Touchin me where?) Yeah there

[Hook]
Candy (no doubt, do you wanna bounce?)
It's the same feelin I always seem to get around you
Let's get this started now
Let's get this started now

[Verse 3]
I know the deal, I talked to Mary Jane and she said
Your ex-boyfriends Mike and Ike are both Lemonheads
I ain't tryin ta player hate girl I know
That you go with Bazooka Joe
Now you know he don't love you like that
He tryin ta get a Reeses piece of the Kit-Kat
Really hon, what he need is a jawbreaker
Cause I'm the one that'll love you baby Now and Later
Be my Peppermint Paddy with a Hundred wishes
An I'll be your Hershey daddy with a hundred kisses
Get the Twins M&M's, they booked all outta flights today
Me an you can Starburst to the Milky Way
I don't care what it cost, girl a Hundred Grand
We could snicker all night at my Jolly Ranch
Just me and you, I'll call your friends up too
Cause I could get my friends Babe Ruth and Charleston Chew

[Hook]

[Intro: Sonny Cheeba]
Yes
At the start of the new jiggyness
With the Trackmasters
Camp Lo and
Willie
Gon' give it to ya
Know what I mean
Lot of macaronis here
Check it out for all the Tenderonis
Ah ha ha
Like Chachi and Joanie

[Verse 1: Will Smith]
Lights camera action
The hip-hop attraction
Fresh Priggy, John Bliggy
Player haters been hatin' all my playin' for years
Now they seein' they worst fears as I bathe in cheers
Parades and accolades
All shades and ages
It's me the outrageous, my zeal contagious
The smile inspirator, Aspen to Grenada
One of the only MCs to say cheese with Schwarzenegger
Everywhere I go they know me
Planet Hollywood in Paris accidentally spilt a drink upon Naomi
Truth of the matter I've been loungin'
Livin' it up, givin' it up in opulent surroundings
Been around the world and I-yi-yi
Ain't seen another this fly-yi-yi
My attitude pervasive, my effervescence
Bringing you back to the essence, with the...

[Chorus: Will Smith (Camp Lo)]
Yes yes y'all (and ya don't stop)
Mic check y'all (and ya don't quit)
Yes yes y'all (and ya don't stop)
Mic check y'all (and ya don't quit)
Yes yes y'all (and ya don't stop)
Mic check y'all (and ya don't quit)
Yes yes y'all (and ya don't stop)
Mic check y'all (and ya don't quit)

[Verse 2: Will Smith]
Verse two 'bout to slay you worst than the first verse
Packin' my purse but yo without one curse
I survive in ratified air where only few can live
Thoughts in my brain like that train in The Fugitive
I pledge allegiance to the soul of the game
Stepped away as Fresh Prince came back with my real name
A rose by any other still beautifies the room
So don't get consumed when a brother's known to gloom
It's semantics but yo it's really good to be back
Never racing the rap just lacing the track
Not serendipity with me it was a plan B
'Bout to have an Oscar standin' next to my Grammys
Plural, mucho, no need to talk though
I'm a just do so
I'm comin' at ya with the smoothest slickness
Behold the style lick of this, kickin'...

[Chorus: Will Smith (Camp Lo)]
Yes yes y'all (and ya don't stop)
Mic check y'all (and ya don't quit)
Yes yes y'all (and ya don't stop)
Mic check y'all (and ya don't quit)
Yes yes y'all (and ya don't stop)
Mic check y'all (and ya don't quit)
Yes yes y'all (and ya don't stop)
Mic check y'all (and ya don't quit)

[Verse 3: Will Smith]
A GQ cover twice
This brother's nice
Vanity Fair you saw me there
I discovered life
Outside of rap got the cream and all that
But kinda left a void in me
You can't keep runnin' in and out of my life
Said my mic, aight
Pump your radio you could record
As they place my welcome mat at the music awards
Coming through America, tinted in high beams
Rose petals at my feet like I'm Prince Akeem
So to all you player haters while y'all sayin' y'all rhyme
Please stop sayin' Jada 'cause that name's mine
I rocked the Philly fade with the divin' waves
Yes y'allin' 'til I'm bald like Issac Hayes
Bad eyes or greys, back pain or bad legs
I'm a get better with age, trust

[Chorus: Will Smith (Camp Lo)]
Yes yes y'all (and ya don't stop)
Mic check y'all (and ya don't quit)
Yes yes y'all (and ya don't stop)
Mic check y'all (and ya don't quit)
Yes yes y'all (and ya don't stop)
Mic check y'all (and ya don't quit)
Yes yes y'all (and ya don't stop)
Mic check y'all (and ya don't quit)
Yes yes y'all (and ya don't stop)
Mic check y'all (and ya don't quit)
Yes yes y'all (and ya don't stop)
Mic check y'all (and ya don't quit)
Yes yes y'all (and ya don't stop)
Mic check y'all (and ya don't quit)
Yes yes y'all (and ya don't stop)
Mic check y'all (and ya don't quit)

[Intro]
Big Will, raisin' the roof, raisin' the roof
(Show 'em how to do it, Will)

[Verse 1]
Observe the high roller, mic controller
Number one hip-hop son, call me solar
Why? 'Cause I shine, praise the Big Willie, I'm
Raised in Philly, I, daze and thrillin' ya
Don't be silly, ya, can't see me
Again I'm killin' ya on MTV
Just get with it my friend (Damn another award?)
Dat kid done did it again (Oh my Lord!)
Da fantastic, boombastic
Gettin' ten times hotter than any you other cats get
Practice, you lack this, I'm the real McCoy
First with Jeff I was startin'
Then with Martin I'm a Badboy
See more green than David Banner
More juice than Tropicana
You hawkin' me like Atlanta
MCs just flee, they rightfully concerned
Big Will wants the mic back, it's my turn to burn

[Interlude]
Baby, uh, baby, uh
Verse two, verse two

[Verse 2]
I'm back attackin' the mic, hype like a Viking
Strikin' like a python, blaze like Jon
A hip-hop icon, MC radical
Back on track from my rap/act sabbatical
Nine-point-six on the richter, kicked her
Yeah so slick the, chicks quick to, flip tha
Bright glance and the tight pants for the slight chance
(Big Willie, can we get one dance?)
Why yes, you may an', I'm just sayin'
That dress you playin', is A-Okay an'
This is your chance for, at least it could be
Me, you an your girlfriend on the dancefloor, ménage-boogie
On the scene I fronts and dashin', fashion
Lost my cream once, now I'm stashin', cashin'
Countries and currencies, like a true Don
It's a new time and it's mine, watch me shine
The way I blaze through the days and nights
How I deal with the craze, my momma raised me right
Whether I'm on stage or in the studio booth
A hundred proof, raisin' the roof, raisin' the roof

[Chorus]
(Y'all know) Can't nobody rock a crowd like me
(She know) Can't nobody make it bounce like me
(He know) Can't nobody get it hot like me
(You know) Y'all need to stop 'cause you can't see me
(Y'all know) Can't nobody rock a crowd like me
(He know) Can't nobody make it bounce like me
(She know) Can't nobody get it hot like me
(Y'all know) Y'all need to stop 'cause you can't see me

[Verse 3]
Seven continents I bruise all cruise
Adidas, kilts, or bamboos and no shoes
Eskimos to Aborigines
I'll test the flows of the world's MCs
I'll hit you out the ball park, you just all talk
Don't be lookin' at my script, you can't play my part
See I'm a rapper that's a actor, you act rap with no heart
The way that I compose those flows like Mozart
Gets somthing like a symphony, when I'm orchestratin' 'em
Ever since the days of me and Jeff at the Paladium
All my life I've been the cream of the crop
Shoppin' a dream, now I got a crop full of cream
I raise mics for the flow of it, you know the show of it
Not the Benz 600 four door of it
I'm a rhyme regardless of earnin'
Long as my heart keeps yearnin' I gots to keep burnin'

[Chorus]
(Y'all know) Can't nobody rock a crowd like me
(She know) Can't nobody make it bounce like me
(He know) Can't nobody get it hot like me
(You know) Y'all need to stop 'cause you can't see me
(Y'all know) Can't nobody rock a crowd like me
(He know) Can't nobody make it bounce like me
(She know) Can't nobody get it hot like me
(Y'all know) Y'all need to stop 'cause you can't see me
(Y'all know) Can't nobody rock a crowd like me
(She know) Can't nobody make it bounce like me
(He know) Can't nobody get it hot like me
(You know) Y'all need to stop 'cause you can't see me
(Y'all know) Can't nobody rock a crowd like me
(He know) Can't nobody make it bounce like me
(She know) Can't nobody get it hot like me
(Y'all know) Y'all need to stop 'cause you can't see me
(Y'all know) Can't nobody rock a crowd like me
(She know) Can't nobody make it bounce like me
(He know) Can't nobody get it hot like me
(You know) Y'all need to stop 'cause you can't see me
...

[Verse 1: Will Smith]
I thought you was the one hon, yeah, when I met you at the Freak Nik
Whoever thought you'd be the type to creep and keep secrets
My friends said don't sleep but I did so now I'm reapin'
The seeds that I sowed I can't believe you so deceivin'
Sneakin' out on the weekends with Michelle
One of your freak friends from the East end, she bad as hell
Half black and Indonesian, the one that taught you treason
Cupid shoot me on my heart, but damn, why you leave it bleedin'?

[Verse 2: Valvin Roane]
I gave you no reason to lie
But you chose to live untrue
Knowin' how I feel inside
There's no telling what I might do, 'cause I gave you

[Pre-Chorus: Valvin Roane]
All my mind, all my soul from the very start
I gave you full control and you broke my heart
I tried to show you a better way of life
But I see that must be what you like

[Chorus: Will Smith & Valvin Roane]
I loved you more than anything
I tried to build a future, turn a house into a home
I wanted us to be one flesh and one bone
It's so hard to keep my sanity
Now all I could do is sit back and reminisce
Look at the pictures in the frames, yo, why you play the games, yo?

[Verse 3: Will Smith]
As I think back to the beginnin', we was together
We both loved sports, long walks, and autumn weather
Both wanted kids and a family, a strong personality
I liked the way you handled me
Candles be lit, mood set, food set, "You ready yet?"
That's what you said while you was massagin' my ear
Now look here I could never leave you lonely
Cause the love you showed me had me feelin' like you already had known me
'Member when you used to blindfold me till I don't see
"Use your mind," is what you told me, kissin' me slowly
Never was the loud type, always on the low key
Pretty smile but rugged, damn, a brother loved it

[Verse 4: Valvin Roane]
Thought birds of a feather are 'sposed to fly together
Guess that don't apply to birds of your kind, no
'Cause you only wanted what you wanted like a vulture, yeah
Came to steal my heart and then leave me to die

[Pre-Chorus: Valvin Roane]
All my mind, all my soul from the very start
I gave you full control and you broke my heart
I tried to show you a better way of life
But I see that must be what you like

[Chorus: Will Smith & Valvin Roane]
I loved you more than anything
I tried to build a future, turn a house into a home
I wanted us to be one flesh and one bone
It's so hard to keep my sanity
Now all I could do is sit back and reminisce
Look at the pictures in the frames, yo, why you play the games, yo?
I loved you more than anything
I tried to build a future, turn a house into a home
I wanted us to be one flesh and one bone
It's so hard to keep my sanity
Now all I could do is sit back and reminisce
Look at the pictures in the frames, yo, why you play the games, yo?
I loved you more than anything
I tried to build a future, turn a house into a home
I wanted us to be one flesh and one bone
It's so hard to keep my sanity
Now all I could do is sit back and reminisce
Look at the pictures in the frames, yo, why you play the games, yo?

[Intro]
Yo, when I released my first single back in like '86
People was like, "Oh you know, that's popcorn" and you know, "they weak"
You know, then I mess around, I go World Trade on them
Bangin' out them multi-plats, they still got negativity to bring
My thing is you can't say nothing nice, don't say nothing

[Verse 1]
Take your place, allow me to flex a taste
As my accomplishments bring up my comp like Mase
Face me the star of stage and TV
My face be seen in almost every country
Grammy winner, soon to be Oscar nominee
Who he? "That's dressed Jiggy, straight from West Philly"
Thought I was whack 'cause I wanted to act
Now every brother and his mother that rap be trying to do that
The ill kid, hundred million dollar bill kid
The one you love to chill with; come on, keep it real, kid!
Don't try to act like this summer at the greek
You won't be bumpin' the big Willie in your jeep
I know y'all still feel me, really, don't act silly
Thought I feel off just becuase I left Philly
Took a break from the rap thing, went on hiatus
I picked up the art of acting and multiplied papers
I chilled on silk sofas, chatting with Oprah
She asked me if it's true that me and Jeff broke up
While y'all kids busy playing drug pimp and playa
I was at my crib in Barbados, chillin' with Jada
Vertex is me, the magnanamous
Got you sayin' "Damn, I've always been a fan of his!"
Y'all know how it is, oh wait, hold up, y'all don't!
Look here, y'all don't say nothing, then I won't

[Hook]
Just don't say nothing (Don't say nothing)
Just don't say nothing (Don't say nothing)

[Verse 2]
Man, I love being me ready to rock the block
With some more hot top notch **** for you to cop
No more Mr. Nice Guy
My whole life I've been smiling when I felt like whiling
Jealousy swinging on me made his attack
(He soft, he whack; man, that ain't real rap!)
You believe that? It hurt me at first, but it's cool
Took the insults feed it to my ego used it for fuel
Now everywhere I turn a dead end
Hundred women coming at me waving pads and pens
And they be screaming out, "Oh my lord!
Did you see it's that brother from ID4?"
"Now, can I please get (a picture and your signature?)" "Sure you can, miss"
"Oh my god, my girlfriends, they ain't gonna believe this!"
Worldwide, wait! Nah, hold up, galactic
Hear my name, don't nothing change but the accent
Bangok to Madagascar, they wanna see me
Prince epe in Spain; Japan, I'm cota eshe
I like my steaks thick and my jets private
And my son to ride in the cockpit
I know he's only four, taking lessons from the pilot
While I'm on my cell with my broker getting stock tips
Find a magazine and I read the hottest gossip
Man, who'd've thought my life would be such an interesting topic?
Well y'all know how it is, wait, hold up, y'all don't!
Well look here, y'all don't say nothing, then I won't

[Hook]
Just don't say nothing (Don't say nothing)
Just don't say nothing (Don't say nothing)
Just don't say nothing (Don't say nothing)
Just don't say nothing (Don't say nothing)

[Verse 3]
Go ahead, adjust the balance and the bass in your speakers
Make sure my voice sounding crisp in your tweeters
I'm about to show you how a man like me works
Shorty get ice five carrots and nothing cheaper
Four five chromed out former two seater
Fifty inch Sony to watch Siskel and Ebert
'Cause I'm about to get two thumbs up, ten toes
One knee and probably a couple of elbows
'Cause yo, I'm the man and the whole world knows
Rock film festivals and rap shows
All the critics jealous people and back-stabbers
My so-called friends, who been nothing but actors
You're way outta character, but now, who's the bomb?
It's Will from West Phil', just slightly transformed
Y'all know what it is
Ah damn, that's right, y'all don't!
But look here, y'all don't say nothing, then trust me, I won't!

[Hook]
Just don't say nothing (Don't say nothing)
Just don't say nothing (Don't say nothing)
Just don't say nothing (Don't say nothing)
Just don't say nothing (Don't say nothing)

[Will]
I-I-I-I woke up this morning
Looked at ya picture
Think about when I'm a get wit'cha
Hit ya on the two-way simply to say I gotta see you today
They say love is a gamble and if so, baby I'm the Belagio I can't lose
And I guess that make you the Mirage
Wait you more exotic than that you like the Taj Mahal momma
You a treasure to me life with you is a pleasure to me
And I'm a make sure no man ever measure to me
Like Run and D you and me are together forever
I got an interview to do (whoo)
Then to the plane, that too (whoo)
Uh wear that black dress boo (whoo)
Then close your eyes and open your heart and I'm a give you

All my love
A thousand kisses from you is never to much
All my love
Never too much never too much never too much
Uh huh uh huh
And I just don't wanna stop
Never too much mever too much

[Jada]
Woke up this morning to invite and couldn't wait to write you
I licked your back and then kissed three little kids that look just like you
Love is magic, can’t explain and sometimes it just happens
Saw your picture your so silly boy you keep my laughing
We've got a photo shoot can't concentrate my mind is roamin'
Because it's 4 o'clock and at 5:15 you are comin' home and
You know my heart you know my thoughts so ruffneck yet you're tender
The only person ever locked up safe was to surrender

All my love (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)
A thousand kisses from you is never to much
All my love
Never too much never too much never too much
Uh huh uh huh
Cause I just don't wanna stop

[Will]
Yo, yo, mi amor, it's like a Picasso painted your aura
It's like Beethoven composed your vocal tones
Rodin inspired hand sculpted you the desire of man (uh)
Michelangelo grieves inside you
Seeds of my wildest dreams fertilized in your eyes
Your compationate and your passion is how you ration it
That makes me swear you was trained how to take me there
Rarely I seen faith be fared
We got a stroke of grace
Remember you was countin me out?
It's crazy we had times of doubt right?
And since the dawn of time written history
Better men better poet than me
Have tried to set verse to the love they knew
Dead to words judge what I do when I give you

A thousand kisses from you is never to much
All my love
Never too much never too much never too much
Uh huh uh huh
And I just don't wanna stop
Never too much mever too much

[Hook 1]

[Verse 1]
Get your hands off me
Stop tryin to hold me down
Let me just move around
Girl somethin' done happened to me
Swear to God
Somethin' done snapped in me
I need the whole floor for us
I'm 'bout to bust, mami
And its glorious
I can't seem to stop my feet
You hear my heart beat, digga digga digga digga digga digga
Oh lord, I'mma 'bout to pass out
But when the night is over I'mma be the last out
Sweat pumpin' in my eyes
Vision a blur
But even though my eyes is closed I see visions of her
Un besito mama en be boca
Estoy bien livin' la vida loca
Heart jumpin and pumpin its about to pop
But don't tell me nothin' back up

[Hook 2]
I can't stop, da da da da da da da
I can't stop, da da da da da da da
I can't stop, da da da da da da da

[Verse 2]
The way you press against me
You messin' with me
The way that dress is fittin'
It's got to be forbidden
No reason for security, ma
Feelin' secure
You gaurdin my body, baby
Come on and gimme some more
If all these people wasn't in here, flockin around
And how you in the middle of the floor, baby knockin you down
The dude who be talkin' bout
When I walk in the house cameras like click click click, gizz gizz gizz
A damn shame
How you do the damn thang
Girl you off the damn chain
But you 'bout to be tamed
Look at you
Laughin' and grinnin' and dancin' and spinnin'
It wasn't my intention
But you got me cringin' my linen, come on
Call me a doctor
Give me a respirator
Look into my eyes
Mama, pressure is rapidly rising
All around my naked leg, all around my thigh
Feels like Ecs. when you next to me getting me high
Girl you dancin' honey, that's how I like to play
I be Patrick Swaze, you be Jennifer Gray
High heels stiletto
Sexy straight out the ghetto
She fire
Its like I'm dancin with the devil
Un besito mama en be boca
Estoy bien livin' la vida loca
Heart jumpin and pumpin its about to pop
But don't tell me nothin' back up

[Hook 3]
I can't stop, da da da da da da da

I can't stop, da da da da da da da
(baby don't hold me back, won't stop, don't stop)
I can't stop

[Verse 4]
Its like a dream or a TV show or a cinema scene
Brother only dancin' lambada
People treating me mean
Why they be flippin' and trippin' on me
Chasin' me down
Grippin' on me
Racin' around
Disgracin' the sound
Got me on the run
Runnin' for havin fun
They way they come and attack they act like I had a gun
Cops gimme room
Stop tryin' to gimme doom
They got me like roooooooooom
I don't care who it is
I ain't stoppin' for no helicopter
I ain't no fugitive
Bonnie and Clyde alive
Its me and my shortie
Get from in front of me
I don't want to hurt nobody
Un besito mama en be boca
Estoy bien livin' la vida loca
Heart pumpin' and jumpin its about to pop
Suckers don't come no closer, back up

[Hook 4]
I can't stop, da da da da da da da
(baby don't hold me back, can't stop, won't stop)
I can't stop, da da da da da da da

Back again but with a couple of friends
Thought my reign would end, well now I'm rubbin it in
I'm back yes, yes yallin', back again ballin
Out for a couple of years thought I had fallen
You seen me with Denzel and Russ Crowe
But yo the movies just a chick on the side I'm in love with the flow
Time off to be an Oscar nominee now
Back to the M-I-C to MC now
Rockin the ol' heads blazing the youth
Only rapper had the president raising the roof
Check the tape, checkmate, it's one mission
Make your move, don't fight submission
To dawn to dusk, we on a trust
Just don't miss the bus, to jam on with us, come on

(Verse 3 - Will Smith)
A hip hop superhero, a widow, cape or a suit
Hit the studio every year or so, and escape with the loot
On my down time straight to the links
I could pack a dance floor, a movie theatre or truck from brinks
On Christmas, mom and wife douse 'em with ice
AOL, search will smith thousands of sites
And at the club, hands clappin' toes tappin'
Sucka I'm the greatest thing ever happen to rappin'
Best shape of my life destined to show ya
No scrapes or fender benders lead the game total
Free, don't move hip hop mogul
Philly ain't happy I, I be the guy to go
The guy to go, you know the go to guy
The mega man that got the whole crew like
Damn Will den done did it again
He done stepped up to the plate and he done hit it again
Yo get them hands up
(Tra-Knox)
Throw your hands up
Wave 'em like you don't care
You like the sound then
Then let me hear you say

(Verse 1)(Will Smith)
Uh, check, check
Yo, yo, yo
Across the room shared a little gaze with me
Crazy mama how your scent played with me
Eyes never hiding your heart angelic looking
Faking disinterest but I can tell you're looking
Face to face her eye to eye stance with me
Didn't even say nothing I felt you wanna dance with me
You push me back a little when I kissed your hand
Said you was attracted to me truly but you had a man
I put my finger up (Shhh) don't say nothing
He ain't here is he? We can play or something
He at the crib oh, I see you live with him
What you gone get married to him and have some kids with him
Us could be just a weekend thing
Just a weekday thing, just a thing ma
Look we can have everything else
But for tonite let me have you for myself
Girl holla at me
(Chorus)(Tra-Knox)
You can have the rest of your life
Give me tonite
You can have the rest of your life
Give me tonite
You can have the rest of your life
Just give me tonite
You can have the rest of your life
Just give me tonite, give me tonite

(Verse 2)(Will Smith)
Whoop!Whoop!
Big Will coming through like

Whoop!Whoop!
East girls off the hook ain't they
Right, right
(Tra-Knox)
Baby girl
You know exactly what I want
No I'm not tryna replace your man
I just want one night to you all over
Baby girl
This our secret rondevue
Look in my eyes I'm telling you
All I'm tryna do is change your view
For a moment or two
Baby girl
I don't wanna break up your happy home
Baby I don't wanna be alone
So let me jump in the zone
Can't you feel the Jones
(Chorus)

(Verse 3)(Will Smith)
Thinking of living your life as a hundred yards long
Give me a quarter-inch thats all I'm asking
Do the math I'm the sun you the earth
Its U-N-I-verse and its the worst
Cuz I thirst to tape connect her
I know you got a life momma
Trust me I don't wanna bring your life drama
I can barely hear my think slide with me
Dip out the side door take a ride with me
Let me hear about (Uh)
What you think about (Uh)
What you need to do (Uh)
The things you dream about (Whoo)
Your Body with me but I know where your heart's at
(Phone rings) Let it ring ma call him back
Wishing I could stop the clock to make it last with you
Am I gon' be at home alone with a glass slipper
Is it a sin to pretend with another fella
Midnight the story ends like Cinderella

(Chorus)X2

[Verse 1]
Yo, yo forget the club
Today we play in the block
It's goin' down and it's blazzin' hot
Jeff pop the new CD turn tables joints
You just got to get the amps from Boogie
Get the van from Rock and then
Call up Ishkabibble's, Jim's and Pat's
And tell 'em we need cheese steaks for like, 300 cats
And yo, make sure it's hot or else I'm sendin' 'em back
And get my mic right
If I get hyped, I might rap
Then take the speakers find a good spot
Subs on the bottom, tweeters up top
Yo, you know where little John lives on the corner
The extension cord'll run perfectly to his crib
And then tell Officer Mike to barricade the block
Regardless what car you got, leave it up top
You wanna come, you got to come on your feet
Ain't nothin' like havin' a party
When it's out in the street, come on

[Hook- Tra-Knox]
Nine o'clock I'mma call my crew
And ten o'clock we gonna roll on through
I don't know what you gon do
But whatever you do, hit the block party tonight

All the ladies rollin' up with friends
And don't be late or you won't get in
Our party's packed from begining to end
Everybody tell a friend that the block party's tonight

[Verse 2]
It's ain't nothin' like
Havin' a party on the block
When everybody know everybody on the block
And everybody on the block
Come to the party on the block
And when the sun drop, (we don't stop)
Funny how fast they travel the word
A dozen divas from North Philly drove in when they heard
That it's a block party down in West Philly
Come block party with Jeff and Big Willy
Stand back, everybody come to see the man rap
Jeff got it... jam packed
Everybody, hands in the air
(Just get your hands in the air!)
Yo Philly! (dat's where the party's at!)
Uuh, D.C. y'all! (dat's where the party's at!)
A-T-L (dat's where the party's at!)
West side! (dat's where the party's at!)
Mid-west y'all (dat's where the party's at!)
Dirty South now (dat's where the party's at!)
Yo, I can't hear y'all! (dat's where the party's at!)
Where ever we at! (dat's where the party's at!)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yo, yo and when the sun drop
Back in Philly that don't mean that the fun stop
All it mean is that it's time to turn the lights on
All day long I been plottin' on this nice john
It's ten o'clock now Jeff is tryin' to hype me
Will the Fresh Prince come up to the mic please?
Hear the crowd cheer, broguht a little smile out
Mic check, one, two- I'm 'bout to wild out
I know he's old, but
Mabye it's a slight chance
I could get my brother hype
Make him break dance- ha, maybe not
Lemme get the crowd jumpin'
Let me him 'em with the brand new funk or something
I'm like Rob Base- I wanna rock right now
Y'all know who run the block right now
All we need is a mic and a beat
And a couple of speakers
And some turn tables out in the street, come on!

[Hook]

[Intro]
Uh, Big Will, and Tra-Knoxy

SHAKE, whatcha momma gave ya baby don't let nothin', BREAK
Ya watch, cause we both can't have much time it's gonna TAKE
Dance floor packed, it's looking like a LAKE
OF SEDUCTION, here's your instructions, SLIDE

Tracking aphrodisiac, don't be DENIED
Chill wit that cigarette, take it out SIDE
Messing wit my vibe, I DON'T LIKE THAT, BOUNCE

[Verse Two: Will Smith]

I told him it's this hot spot that we GOTTA BURN
He said man after last weekend haven't YOU LEARNED
Look here dunny last weekend was a MISTAKE
That mami tryna dish it out, when she COULDN'T TAKE
Come at me dancin' wild like as soon as a GAME
One little move on her, and she burst into FLAMES (Whoosh)
The whole club runnin', tryna ruin my NIGHT
I told roll around a little, she be ALRIGHT
Now everybody mad at me, all up in my FACE
Somebody shoulda told that girl to stay in her PLACE
Ya feel a little heat baby girl I'm BEHIND YA
And hopefully ya burnt Gucci dress will REMIND YA
How serious I am, maybe it's CRAZY Y'ALL
But if you wanna play honey, GO GET A BABY DOLL, holla at me

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Will Smith]
HUH, check to make sure I'm lookin' cute for her
HUH, check to make sure I'm packin' loot for her

No more actin', BACK TO RAPPIN' AGAIN
Red carpet, hectic, gettin' ME IN
What happened last week, SURE CAN HAPPEN AGAIN
Mos Def, ON bump, WHEN YA, hear the BOUNCE, front
Looking like the Jet Magazine Beauty of the MONTH
Shades on now ya layin' low on the CUT
Told myself you the one to shake it up, with
BOUNCE, over to ya table came completely UNANNOUNCED
Observed the curves, body fat about an OUNCE
Though almost bumpin' out of dangerous AMOUNTS
Grab ya arm, turn around girl, JUMP

Addicted to the way I kick it, I know what you WANT

I'm Comin... I'm Comin... I'm Comin... I'm Comin
I am the man in black I'm back
Breaking the back of the random attackers
So can the flak
Yo Im dangerous
I've been trained to bust
When a stranger fuss try to endanger us
Praise me y'all
Dont nothing faze me y'all
When they see me their gaze be all crazy y'all
They say I'm a myth
Trust me if somebody riff
Out of the depths of your imagination appears Will Smith
Black suit, the black shades, the black shoes
Black tie with the black attitude
New style black Ray-Bans
I'm stunning man
New hotness pitch black six hundred man
Don't you understand?
What you thought I wouldn't come again?
Leave you hanging without bringing you the fun again?
Tangling with the alien scum again
Monumental it's the black suits running in
Chorus 1:
(Nod Ya Head! The Black Suits Comin')
Let me see you (Nod Ya Head! The Black Suits Comin')

Check it
Yo it's this chick right
Serleena, making me sick right
Earth is worthless to her she be tripping like
Threatening me and my mens
Trying to get the light
Thinking she's superwoman
But black kryptonite finishing whatever you start son
The best looking crime fighter since myself in part one
Better act right and play nice and sing along

Wanna brawl with me? Trying to brawl with me?

Check it, Check it
Yo, case closed

Chased away by the black suits, shades, and clothes
We above the law
Feds can't touch me y'all
Highly ranked black blank I.D. card
So disregard what you think you saw
Put that phone down now
Who you think you calling huh?
One little flash then good night there
Just open your eyes honey look right here
Thank you mission completed
I mean it we won't be defeated
You seen it we did it even with weapons depleted
Galaxy defenders don't act like you don't remember
Taking contenders and proving they only pretenders
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls
The Men In Black is back to protect the world
When the enemy is near the elite is here
So have no fear just let me see you

[Chorus]
Girl stop shaking
You got my will breaking
Lovin' Jamaica but I gotta go home
I got my girl waitin'
I'm spos' to land at eight and
If I'm not there then I can't go home
Ma you got me bakin'
I'm bout' to make a mistakin'
I'm bout' to ask you to take me home
Please stop shaking
You got my will breakin'
Lovin Jamaica but I gotta go home

[Verse 1]
Ten days I'm in Jamaica workin'
Ain't' had a chance to get out and do to much than nothin' else but workin'
It's killin' me
Ain't' had a chance to get that chicky jerkin'
Responsibility taste the victory but desire lerkin'
I been recording right and rappin' and ryming
Notin' but heat ain't' even had a chance to see the island
I need dat'
Me and the team we got a dream a' comin'
The spot we heard about through her mouth
This club of silam
Let's finish up
Then like a breeze off the sea's
When you arrive at the party
Host this
She Desserie flirtin' heavily with me
Got me thinkin' things I really probobly shouldn't be
Evertime she move she look at me
(Chorus)

[Verse 2]
(Everytime she moves)
I don't know how to act
Came to get my groove on
Not to get my groove back
Her eyes deep enough to swim in
She grinnin'
Her innersence inpire thoughts of sinnin'
Crazy right?
She got a  -  flower so long she smilin'
Her shakin' makin' Jamaica seem like temptation island
I'm wilin'
Cause' man she hot
What I'm gonna do?
Feelin' like the moment of truth
Fakin' my concience
Lovin the mood
What's a brother to do?
Makin' me think Desserie a Jamaican queen
Makin' me hatin' to leave cause' the shakin' is mean
Windin' hips
Got me growin' fond of this islandness but i'm manganese
So far y'all
(Chorus)

[Verse 3]
(Could it be that she's lookin' at me)
(Sendin' messages sweat Desserie)
(Try na' get away cause she was meant for me)
(Oh no I'm tryin' to get home)
(Tell me what else is a man's to do)
(When temptation is comin' at you)
(I love my girl but I see somthing new)
(Oh no I gotta get home)

If I want you so
Me want you so
(I may never want to go home)
If I want you so
Me want you so
(I may never want to go home)
If I want you so
Me want you so
(I may never want to go home)
If I want you so
Me want you so
(I may never want to go home)

(Chorus)
If I want you so
Me want you so

[ Tra-Knox - Singing ]:
"Ew, ew, ew, ew, ewww"
* Sang in Intro, and picks up for the last two lines of Verse 1 *

[ Verse 1 : Will Smith ]
Yo, at 17 years old I started runnin' the streets
Man I had some fun in the streets
11, 12, sometimes 1 in the streets
By 18, I started seein' the sun in the streets
My mom started trippin' on me like "Will, you gotta choose your friends carefully
Like I trust you, but please call me
And when you have kids of your own, you'll see
I'm gonna be here when all your friends won't"
But I was busy hollerin' "Parents Just Don't Understand"
Now here I am with the family, runnin' the lines she ran on me
We ain't always see eye to eye, but Ma on your principles now I rely
You got me tastin' my toes

[ Chorus - Tra-Knox (Will Smith) ]
You go to trust in moms (haha) all day long (haha, haha)
I didn't know (didn't know but)
When my momma told me, don't go down that road (she told me don't go)
Don't go down that road, (but, but) but I gotta go, go (gotta go), where I gotta go, go
So thank you for not tellin' me I told you so
* Singing: "ew, ew, ew," goes from last line of chorus, into 1st line of Verse 2

[ Verse 2: Will Smith (Tra-Knox) ]
I used to roll hard with this dude named Chuck (Chuck)
Rollin' in my car, with this dude named Chuck (Chuck)
My mom ain't really liked this dude named Chuck (Chuck)
She thought that he was really impolite (Chuck)
Chuck and me used to roll out faithfully
Inevitably you see Chuck, you gonna see me
Like we on TV, the bosomest of buddies
Share food, clothes, and money (ewww)
And hunnies (ewww) flocked like we was players from the NBA
Still hurts to recall the day, I heard him say
To this girl named Mya, I was datin'
He told her I was a liar, joker hatin'
He told her I be cheatin' on women
Breakin' hearts and grinnin'
He told her, her life would be better with him in it
That's the friend I chose

[ Chorus - Tra-Knox (Will Smith) ]
You go to trust in moms all day long (ew)
I didn't know (but)
When my momma told me, don't go (uh) down that road (she told me don't go)
Don't go, don't go down that road, (but, but) but I gotta go, go, where I gotta go, go (uh)
So thank you for not tellin' me I told you so (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
* Solo of Tra-Knox singing: "ew, ew, ew" is mixed together with the beat *

[ Verse 3 - Will Smith ]
Momma used to say, "take your time young man
I ain't gonna always be there holdin' your hand
But you'll always know exactly where I am
And when I'm not there, in my place, the lord will stand
Will study the world, only the wise succeed
And when your eyes tell lies, your heart should leave
You gonna do dirt, we all gonna sin
But when you realize and apologize, and never do it again"
Ma told me, "don't rush to get old
If you got youth, the truth clutched in your hold
It's like possibilities too much to behold
An emotional shield, from life's blustery cold"
Ma all the stuff was hard, you said was hard
Childish disregard, because my head was hard
Now no question to pose

[ Chorus - Tra Knox ]

[Hook - Tra Knox - singing]
Nothin's on my mind - 16X

[Verse 1 - Will Smith]
Today I'm goin' freestyle
And everythin' is gonna be about me now
And I ain't doin' nothin', I'm gonna cool out
A little somethin' bumpin', but not too loud
Nothin' jumpin'
I'm gonna get my golf clubs
Or call me a masseuse, and get me a soft rub
Or noddin' with a mimosa, in my hot tub
Or two-way momma me, let's go and get a nice scrub
Yeah maybe that, or maybe I could swim some
Or rollin' in my Bentley, follow my rims some
Where? Yo, I don't know, care if none of my friends come
A hat and shades go out and try to blend some, yeah right
Days off is hard to come by
Especially for Hollywood's number one guy
So let me get to movin', while the sun is high
My cell is off, two-way is off
It's yearly crazy, today is gravy

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Will Smith]
Half awake and half asleep
As I watch the sun, it slightly moved a little past its peak
And I feel like Tom Hanks but it's perfect, I'm a "Cast Away"
Agenda full of nothin' but stuff to pass today
My sister asked me to cook somethin'
But that would fall into the category of doin' somethin'
And I done already said to ya'll that I ain't doin' nothin'
So let me say it again to be clea,r I ain't doin' nothin'
Hmm, phew, a breather
I meant what I meant, when I said, when I said it's all leisure
Neither, chart toppin' crowd pleaser
Phone rang Jada said, "Uhh he's uhh," I ain't home, so turn that phone off
Come and sit on my lap, and take a load off
And lay down into my arms, and we could doze off
To work as much as I work, I must be thrown off, what a day

[Hook]

[Tra-Knox]
Yo, yo, yo, mic check, mic check
Ah, that's cool

[Will Smith]
That's hot right

[Tra-Knox]
Yeah, alright I'm gonna do the umm

[Will Smith]
Hey Ramon help me out dog

[Tra-Knox]
This is hot

[Will Smith]
Yo chief, yo Tone, come on

[Hook]
Nothin's on my mind - 25X
Intro:
We come to make it hot for ya

(Verse 1)
I am the man in black I'm back

When a stranger fuss try to endanger us
Praise me y'all
Dont nothing faze me y'all
When they see me their gaze be all crazy y'all
They say I'm a myth
Trust me if somebody riff
Out of the depth of your imagination appears Will Smith
Black suit, the black shades, the black shoes
Black tie with the black attitude
New style black Ray-Bans
I'm stunning man
New hotness pitch black six hundred man
Don't you understand?
What you thought I wouldn't come again?
Leave you hanging without bringing you the fun again?
Tangling with the alien scum again
Mind ya manners or the black suits running in
Nod Ya Head
(Chorus)
When you get down with the black suits baby
Just let it loose let that head go crazy (Let me see you nod ya head)
The way we bouncin and shakin I know you feelin me

So get up out ya seat come on and nod ya head with me

(Verse 2)
Yo Check it
Yo it's this chick right
Serlena, making me sick right
Earth is worthless to her she be tripping like
Threatening me and my mens
Trying to get the light
Thinking she's superwoman
But black kryptonite finishing whatever you start son
The best looking crime fighter since myself in part one
Better act right and play nice and sing along
Cause Kay is back and he hype - what? Bring it on!
We come to make it hot for ya WOOF!

So get up out ya seat come on and nod ya head with me

(Verse 3)
Check it, Check it
Yo, case closed
Erase my foes
Chased away by the black suits, shades, and clothes
We above the law
Feds can't touch me y'all
Highly ranked black blank I.D. card
So disregard what you think you saw
Put that phone down now
Who you think you calling huh?
One little flash then good night there
Just open your eyes honey look right there
Thank you mission completed
I mean it we won't be defeated
You seen it we did it even with weapons depleted
Galaxy defenders don't act like you don't remember
Taking contenders and proving they only pretenders
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls
The Men In Black is back to protect the world
When the enemy is near the elite is here
So have no fear just let me see you
Nod ya head
(Chorus)
When you get down with the black suits baby
Just let it loose let that head go crazy (Let me see you nod ya head)
The way we bouncin and shakin I know you feelin me
So get up out ya seat come on and nod ya head with me (Nod ya head)(Come on)
When you get down with the black suits baby
Just let it loose let that head go crazy (Let me see you nod ya head)
The way we bouncin and shakin I know you feelin me
So get up out ya seat come on and nod ya head with me
Come on

We come to make it hot for ya WOOF!
Come to blow down the block for ya WOOF!
Come to crack the street for ya WOOF!
Blast the windows out ya jeep for ya WOOF!
We don't wanna hear a beat baby WOOF!
Gots to recognize the heat baby WOOF!
It's the MIB baby WOOF!
Got something for all eyes to see baby WOOF!

[Intro]
I believe in God
I believe in destiny
Not destiny in the sense of all of our actions being pre-determined
But destiny in the sense, of our ability to choose
Our ability to choose, who we are and who we're supposed to be

[Verse 1]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, I was born to reign
Point blank my name, to be etched in stone, my destiny pre-ordained
Tryin' to live righteous, fighting for life
This my life, and that's why I go lite on my vices
Tighten the vices of truth, on the ruthless
This rhyme and the crime is they minds is just useless
The path of the poison, the Genesis of the genocide
You and your boys, tryin' to decide
What to write, but your pen is a sword
And the blade has been forged, young minds gettin' gorged
States have been altered, by liquor, by weed
And then hate gets exalted, as art falls to greed
Choices is made, as the voices is laid
On the track, contract, ya souls the wage, sold ya wage
Did you see his new Benz, but your mic a syringe
Now you proud of your binge, gotta lot of new friends, gotta lot of new ends
Bought a house up in the hills fronting shouts to the pen
Giving false accounts, of your accounts amounts
Amounts of fans treason, stands to reason
Since your inception, laced with deception
And bred false affection, it must parish
From my terrace, I see the fire burning the streets
But I won't shield my eyes to the heat

[Outro]
Born to Reign
Oooooooooh
I was Born to Reign
Oooooooooh
I was Born to Reign
(Chorus)
Willow is a player
She's got me going crazy baby
She's got me wrapped around her finger
She's got me going out of my mind
Playing all the the time
Willow is a player
She's got me going crazy baby
She's got me wrapped around her finger
She's got me going out of my mind
Playing all the the time

(Verse 1)
Every time I see her
Can't help but to smile
And every time I touch her
She makes me feel like a child
She got me locked down
Got me locked, locked down
I'd do just about anything
To stay on her good side
And when she wants something
From me she won't be denied
Can't even go shopping
Without buying her a gift
Every eye tied to her
As she steps out the crib
She keep me up all night
On my knees as I pray
Cuz I can't sleep till
I know she's okay
She got me locked down
She got me locked, locked down
(Chorus)

(Verse 2)
I saw another man hold her
Just a friendly hello
I know that it was nothing
But he took too long to let go
Boy you better let her go
OOOOHHHH!! Let my girl, girl go
I try to be tough y'all
Sometimes she make me so mad
Her eyes like diamonds
Make me forget she's so bad
She's my angel
This world she's not of
Sent from the upstairs
Taught me that new kind of love (Love, love, love)
I can't tell y'all
What she means in my life
What make it so crazy
I met her through my wife
She got me locked down
Got me locked, locked down

(Chorus)

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
I always wanted you to be my baby
When you touch me boy you drive me crazy
I don't wanna be your secret lover
When I get you boy there'll be no other

[Pre-Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
You and me its gotta be (the real thing)
Diamond, gold I'll set you free (my baby)
Wait too long boy I'll be gone (so hurry)
Wanna get this love don't do me wrong

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
What you find now (I think I love you)
What you feel now (I think I need you)
What you know now (to be real)

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
I get with you boy on one condition
If you promise not to ever mention
All the things we do to any of your friends
I will promise you love never ends

[Pre-Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
You and me its gotta be (the real thing)
Diamond, gold I'll set you free (my baby)
Wait too long boy I'll be gone (so hurry)
Wanna get this love don't do me wrong

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
What you find now (I think I love you)
What you feel now (I think I need you)
What you know now (to be real)

[Verse 3: Will Smith]
I pulled up 2 the front door of your love and I
Knock knocked and you opened up now you
Can't get enough, you was thinking one lil' date
Ate sushi wit ya soul mate
Dead the ice or the SUV's
Our love grows we chose to water the seeds
You the one I've fallen for the more we walk down love's corridor
The angels all applaud (I want ya)
See the look in my eyes don't ya
Like a kid in my whip with Willy Wonka
Like back in the day playin wit Tonka
Gimme ya palm ma lemme read ya fortune
I see trust with hard times and honesty
We gon' go down in history
One look in your face just prove the fact
That you don't have to chase what you can attract
Now what's real

[Chorus: Mary J Blige]
What you find now (I think I love you)
What you feel now (I think I need you)
What you know now (to be real)
What you find now (got to be real)
What you feel now (got to be real)
What you know now (to be real)
What you find now
What you feel now
What you know now (to be real)

[Intro: Jada Pinkett Smith]
(Ooh, Ohh)
Here I stand before you - brown
Color of the mountains
Colossal as the earth
Wrapped so deliciously within my own joy and misery
Feathers of my wings paralyzed by the distance of my mind
Here I stand before you, the color of the night
Frozen by the potential of me: an Afro Angel
(Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-uh-uh-uh!)

[Verse 1]
Afro Angel off your pedestal from perchin above
You on the prowl now, downtown, searchin' for love
In all the wrong places, outside your radio stations
Hopin' he with new hit single, is tryin' to mingle
Today, he is me in your town, puttin' it down
You in the car with your friends, followin' my limo around
Puttin' a bug in my boy's ear, your "S" is for free
You'll do anything for Omar or Phil, bring you to me
And then me, hypnotized by the devil as well
Hold out my hand as an invitation into my hotel
No need to RSVP, place your hand in my palm
As all your girlfriends getting jealous
"Damn, she landed the bomb!"
Willing to trade your spirit for some crass, whack wage
Something small, something simple as a pass back stage
But now I lay me, down to creep
And I... pray the Lord my soul to keep

[Chorus: Anthem]
Afro Angel, born against the world
You don't have to sell your soul and throw away your pride
Afro Angel, sent from heaven above
Never forget that you are loved
You know that you are loved

[Verse 2]
Lil Bobby got a gun now, age fifteen
Destined to spend his life inside a cage it seems
Rage inside, pride, been denied respect
He can't take it though he gotta earn it
But he ain't learned that yet
Out on the town, reckless abandon he's been bullied before
But now he straps, and no more
Attitude high
Flexin on every guy that walk by
But don't start pal
Cuz if the gun came from the whiz, Cowardly Lion, got heart now
Let's pull it on a stranger
Ahh, fun for the crew
Surprised when he realized
"Damn, dude got one too!"
Smile's upside down now, games ain't so cute
Bobby's a deer in a headlights
"Punk, drop it or I'll shoot"
Then like a sniper, cleanin' his rifle, Bobby disobeys his commands
One shot rings out (*gunshot*) then only the stranger stands
Could of sworn Bobby's blood formed the shape of an angel's wings
But for what?

[Chorus: Anthem]
Afro Angel, born against the world
You don't have to sell your soul and throw away your pride
Afro Angel, sent from heaven above
Never forget that you are loved
You know that you are loved

[Verse 3]
Back in high school, Tamika was the sweetest, the bomb
Hot to death, though in tenth grade a teenage mom
Knocked up by some thug named Russ in the drug game
But had the cutest kid you ever seen
Then all the pressure from her mom
She stepped to Russ
Told him it's either them drugs or us
Either them thugs or us
The ultimatum, either continue bein' a thug in the world
Or start lovin' your girl
He said: "God, bear me witness, no doubt, lovin' ya dear
But to go from $50 Gees a week to $30 Gees a year?
That ain't happenin'..."
I guess he wasn't that strong
He came back the next week, and the whole family was gone
Yo, they straight moved away, without as little as a word
Well... needless to say, Russ was a little perturbed
Then in a fury put the pressure on her girlfriend Shawn
And like a clumsy chef she spilled the beans on where they had gone
Upstate Schenectady
Tamika answered the door
It was the last person she expected to be
They just stared... he said: "You love me for me?
You can do without the cars, vacations, and jewelry?
Down with me? Period
Through life's stress and strife?"
She said: "Yeah", he said: "In that case
Would you please be my wife?"
Then like a sign from the sky, the baby cried
Like an angel sings
I love y'all more than anything

[Chorus: Anthem]
Afro Angel, born against the world
You don't have to sell your soul and throw away your pride
Afro Angel, sent from heaven above
Never forget that you are loved
You know that you are loved
(Yeaahh, uhhh...)
Afro Angel, born against the world
You don't have to sell your soul and throw away your pride
Afro Angel, sent from heaven above
Never forget that you are loved
You know that you are loved

[Intro]
Uhh... hoo!
Uh, yo, Big Will, in the place to be
Mic check and uh, mic check and uh
Uh, uh, yo
Would you love me in the shack in a shanty town?
Would you love me if my pants was hand-me-downs?
Hah, huh?
Yo, yo

[Verse 1]
Often times I hear a phrase when I'm out and about
8 to 80 all walks of life be shouting it out
Usually when it's time for an encore I hear it
But when I did something hot it broke in the spirit
It's weird, it's like a double-edged sword when y'all applaud
It's kinda wild, a peace sign, a smile
How do I respond to the phrase "I love you Will!"
Kinda heavy when I hear it - be like "Damn f'real?"
In a way it make me wanna stay strong and moral
But history, say I could be gone tomorrow
And though my future look floral, it feel like I'm open
For much pain, when people stop shouting my name
And doubting my game, liking  others better than me
Writing, letters to him instead of letters to me
A veteran B, I know the game, but do me this here
In your heart be clear before you bless my ear, c'mon

[Hook]
Could you love me in the shack in a shanty town?
Could you love me if my pants was hand-me-down?
Could you love me if my wrists ain't bling?
If I wasn't on TV, and I ain't sing, huh?
Could you love me if my whip wasn't chrome fitted?
Will my name be easier to forget it, huh?
Could you love me if my wrists ain't bling?
If I wasn't on TV, and I ain't sing, huh?

[Verse 2]
I pray before I sit with a pen and a pad
A birth of a thought occurs, and it calls me dad
And to the universe an idea, released from me
Just a CD? Nah man, a piece of me
But you can't see it that when you be dancing B
As I asked you a question that's how you answer me
So when you don't dance it be like I'm choking from cancer
Like I wrote rancid rhymes, I can't survive, sure
I rationalize, like oh I see
But if you don't like my cut it's like you don't like me
Some stuff works, some works, not so well
It's like you work like hell, still get hurt like hell
Yo, it can tear you apart
But don't let your wins go to your head, your losses go to your heart
And if we ever get the pleasure to meet
Be clever wit and please measure what you yell in the street, c'mon

[Hook]
Could you love me in the shack in a shanty town?
Could you love me if my pants was hand-me-down?
Could you love me if my wrists ain't bling?
If I wasn't on TV, and I ain't sing, huh?
Could you love me if my whip wasn't chrome fitted?
Will my name be easier to forget it, huh?
Could you love me if my wrists ain't bling?
If I wasn't on TV, and I ain't sing, huh?

[Scatting for the first 20 seconds]

[Chorus]
Here he comes, he can rock
He can breakdance and he can pop
He can rap, and he can act
And if it come down to it he can scrap
Hey there, here come Big Will again
Here I come y'all, here I come y'all
Watch your back y'all, here I come y'all

[Verse]
For years I've been tryin' to rip rhymes and get mine
And spit lines hot like lava this time
I don't got a sitcom to bother with
Or a time conflict with my sci-fi hits
I'm contemplatin' each statement's wit
And I'm concentratin' on makin' hits
And I'm fittin 'em, line by line
Teeth I'm grittin' 'em, tryin' to find the perfect rhyme
And scheme I'm dreamin', 'bout y'all gleam and doubt
He's back from actin he's screamin' out
How he practice rappin' now he's devout
Every album track packs what he's about
In the past he passed with passion
Old fashioned boldly mashin' totally crashin'
Words up, in a disorderly fashion but
Back to the lab, and guess what happened?
Kaboom, ooh-wee! Dude's resilient
Fresh Prince was hot, the movies killed him
Wait, hold up, Stop! You can rebuild him
Lock him back in hip-hop while dude's not filmin'
Shocked by the film and the TV money
Went from scenes with Uncle Phil to scenes with Sonny
It's so hard to break free from a guaranteed 20
But it's done, so come see the MC honey!

[Chorus]
Here he comes, he can rock
He can breakdance and he can pop
He can rap, and he can act
And if it come down to it he can scrap
Hey there, here come Big Will again

[Bridge]
Every time he touch the mic
He close his eyes and he hope to shine
And like a streak of light
Intro his name, they be like "ahhhh!"

[Chorus]
Here he comes, he can rock
He can breakdance and he can pop
He can rap, and he can act
And if it come down to it he can scrap
Hey there, here come Big Will again

[Outro]
Here come Big Will again
Here come Big Will again!

[Intro: Will Smith]
Yo, if you can't dance, it's cool to get up now
Yeah see usually y'all stand off on the side
Y'know you're a lil' embarrased or whatever
But this one of them joints for e'rybody
So get up on up, but keep it simple, slide

[Hook: Will Smith & Nicole Scherzinger]
If you can't dance then this is your jam, baby
Left to right, all night, slide, that's all you gotta do
If you can't dance then this is your jam, baby
Left to right, all night, slide, that's all you gotta do

[Verse 1: Will Smith]
Now we all know the boy at the club, all liquored up
Or with the bub tryin' to pick 'em up
Whack dancin', wookin pa nub
His shirt too bright, pants too tight, boy settle down
Now I ain't just messin wit'chu
I got better things to do, I'm tryin' to help
I got a lesson for you, I know you do the best you could do
Wanna get next to boo? Then the less you do, the better
Cause women equate dance with sex
They gon' see you, and be like, next
But you gon' be like, hold up ma!, next
But she gon' be like, uh-uh pah!, next
Now looka here, rule number one, know your name
It ain't Usher, Justin, Hammer? Then we can touch ya
Rule number two, never do a dance you can't do
Why stupid? You can't do it

[Hook: Will Smith & Nicole Scherzinger]
If you can't dance then this is your jam, baby
Left to right, all night, slide, that's all you gotta do
If you can't dance then this is your jam, baby
Left to right, all night, slide, that's all you gotta do

[Refrain: Will Smith]
So I'm up in my spot in Miami the other night right
And this dude out on the floor OD'n, just way overdancin
You know so his mami wanna holla at me

[Verse 2: Will Smith]
She thought my name was Billy, I told her it was Willie
She said she watched my TV show and I was very silly
Told her I was from Philly, she looked at me said really?
And judgin from her t-shirt I could tell that she was chilly
So I gave her my sweater, she said her name was Etta
She said she come from Cuba and she just had bought a Jetta
She said she glad I met her, let's go somewhere together
She said she'd ride in my car, cause she knew my car was better
The conversation cookin, attention gettin' tooken
My Spidey Sense is tinglin', I felt somebody lookin'
Now who this brother lookin, and now he runnin bookin'
I'm mad I'm like the fisherman I almost had my hook in
I figured I should get up, and quickly clear my head up
Rosetta got a man, got me feelin kinda set up
Now dude was really fed up, and yo he wouldn't let up
Homey if I hit you you might never ever get up
Now he was not a dancer, plus he wasn't handsome
Comin like Mel Gibson like I had his girl from ransom
Pedro wanna go outside, Yo amigo, tranquilo, slide

[Hook: Will Smith & Nicole Scherzinger]
If you can't dance then this is your jam, baby
Left to right, all night, slide, that's all you gotta do
If you can't dance then this is your jam, baby
Left to right, all night, slide, that's all you gotta do

[Verse 3: Will Smith]
Now rule number three is easy
Please remember that you ain't on Beach Street
The sweet beat you ain't tryin to win no TV
Another dude get a move no need to outdo it
Rule number four, out on the floor
Don't be doin moves that don't nobody do no more
Draw too much attention it be adventurous on the floor
There's a reason that don't nobody do 'em no more, you feel me?
This may be hilarious
But rule number five is serious, uh
It's a shame to even have to discuss
But it's no lip biting or pelvic thrusts, I mean
You think that move'll put the sting on her?
You too close, tryin' to put a ring on her?
You don't know that girl, don't cling on her
And don't put your thing on her, cool?

[Hook: Will Smith & Nicole Scherzinger]
If you can't dance then this is your jam, baby
Left to right, all night, slide, that's all you gotta do
If you can't dance then this is your jam, baby
Left to right, all night, slide, that's all you gotta do

[Part I: I Wish I Made That]

[Verse 1]
Yo, ain't no better man for this hype track
Just the veteran taking the mic back
David Letterman even said he like that track man
Even though he ain't a rap fan
Black radio, they won't play though
Ever since "Summertime," they ain't liked none of mine
Even though the fans went out and bought enough
I guess they think Will ain't hard enough
Maybe I should just have a shootout
Run up in the bank, bustin', grabbin' all the loot out
Whoop somebody ass, taking my boot out
Right on TV so y'all can see me
Just ignorant, attacking, actin' rough
I mean, then, will I be Black enough?
Oh wait, maybe I'll jack a truck
Full of cigarettes, guns and drugs and stuff

[Chorus]
Get back, I wish I woulda made that
Lean back, I wish I woulda made that
I wish I woulda told the girls to "drop it like it's hot"
Summer, summer, summertime, seems like all I got
Get back, I wish I woulda made that
Lean back, I wish I woulda made that
I wish I woulda told the girls to "drop it like it's hot"
Summer, summer, summertime, seems like all I got

[Verse 2]
I always envied how y'all rocked with Dre and The Chronic
The way that 2Pac, Biggie, 50 and Jigga got it
A lot like L.L., Chuck D, Slick and Dougie
I think y'all love me, but y'all place other rappers above me
And I don't know if you feel my flow
And be at my show and you'll see where I should go
On the charts of rhyme, arts and thoughts in rap form
Damn it, I expanded the platform
Damn it, this cat's on a rap song
Yeah, it ain't no braids or plaits on
Ain't on stage with no gats on
You know I'm afraid, getting' my act on
It might have stunted my growth but I wanted them both
And I hope that it would be less tougher
You do two things and then they both gonna suffer
I chose to act and it broke my heart not to rap
Prodigal son, clever, better than ever, back

[Chorus]
Get back, I wish I woulda made that
Lean back, I wish I woulda made that
I wish I woulda told the girls to "drop it like it's hot"
Summer, summer, summertime, seems like all I got
Get back, I wish I woulda made that
Lean back, I wish I woulda made that
I wish I woulda told the girls to "drop it like it's hot"
Summer, summer, summertime, seems like all I got

[Part II: Swagga]

[Intro]
I got my swagga back
I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back
I got, I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back

[Verse 3]
Yo, do you see that lil' bop in my step
Do you see the little drop to the left, huh, yo
Baseball cap, Timbs when I walk
Do you see that lil' grin when I talk, huh, yo
Do you see me sorta glide when I slide
See lean to the side in my ride, huh, yo
Do you see it's no ice on my wrist
Fish still bite just like this. right, right
Do you know what it mean
When you see a dude's chick on TV gleamin', huh?
Know what it mean to be on the screen
And in the audience, Ali beamin', yo!
I must have a 'S' on my chest
I recovered from the Wild Wild West, yes!
Yo, I been up the creek without a paddle
Now I'm back on the saddle
I got my swagga back

[Chorus]
I got my swagga back
I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back
I got my swagga back
I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back
I got my swagga back
I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back
I got my swagga back

[Verse 4]
All you see that you see when you seeing me
You ain't seeing all to be seen
Cause there's more for you to see
Than when you see me on the scene in my media machine
I mean madness, sickness, sadness, swaggerless back in the day
Fat, ugly chicks in New York on the radio, saying I'm gay
I had a bonafide downside frown
With the swagga not around in my life
Bank account found minimal amounts
When countin' cause of my now ex-wife
I had to bore thick walls and all that
Endure pitfalls and all that, fallin', callin' for help
With no call back, where was ya'll at, gimme the ball back
I got my swagga back

[Chorus]
I got my swagga back
I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back
I got my swagga back
I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back
I got my swagga back
I got that swagga back, I got that swagga back
I got my swagga back
This is a true story
{*"Ms. Loretta"* - 2X}

[Hook: Will Smith singing]
Loretta, wrote a love letter to a stranger
Thought that he would change her life
Thought she would be his wife
Ohhh Loretta, never ever meant him no danger
Her love for him sustain her
Thought that he would change her life

[Verse One: Will Smith]
Ms. Loretta, a young girl, I never really met her
A fun girl, a real go-getter I heard
A gold Jetta a fool with books a nerd
And so I'm told hooked on my every word
Oh so bold, a love letter, cleverly worded
In her jacket pocket, wrapped inside a platinum locket
In the shape of a heart, with pictures of me
Had it inscribed, no us - no him - then no me
She fell in love with "The Prince of Bel-Air"
Fantasy was to see me and to be with me there
So she wrote a love letter to me, and then she signed it Loretta
She said I gotta go get him, Will is my soul mate
We gotta be together, how could we not be together?
Oh wait, if I send the letter
I mean how will I be sure that they give it to him
What if they don't give it to him, that'd ruin everything
I gotta take it to him myself

[Hook: Will Smith singing]

Ohhh Loretta, never ever meant him no danger
Her love for him sustain her

[Verse Two: Will Smith]
She packed all that she owned into the back of her Jetta
Her backpack and her cell phone and her love letter
Most of her stuff was done up with, pictures of me on it
With the phrase "it's gonna be" on it
Her mother beggin her, please come home
And then, Loretta resentin her, leave me alone ma
I won't leave my destiny unfilled
You just jealous because daddy ain't as sweet as my Will, click
To the front gate at NBC
In June or July, backstage at MTV
She would drive any place that they mentioned I'd be
Told herself strive for love and God eventually
Would give me to her, and her to me
This was meant to be
14 months outside every event that I be at
She still keep missin me
And now she, gettin high with more frequency now
Rage rumblin inside, got to be with me now
Then she heard I married Jada - she took her love letter out
And she wrote down P.S. - I hate her

[Hook: Will Smith singing]
Loretta, wrote a love letter to a stranger

[Verse Three: Will Smith]
Kodak Center, where the Oscars is at
She sleep, gettin woke up by the cops in the back
By a dumpster, didn't even greet 'em with fear
Grinnin ear to ear, said my husband meetin me here
You know him, he nominated for his flick Ali
And it'll be hell to pay if y'all pick on me
Don't put that stick on me, hell no I'm not leavin
Get your hands off, don't make them things click on me
Kickin and screamin, you intervenin
This is fate, Mr. what you mean that I ain't?
What you mean it seem like I ain't? Ooh you like my mom
And our love gon' survive y'all hate
God gon' take, me to my destiny
Y'all only are seein one side of me, Will gon' see the rest of me
He gon' see the best of me if I could only get him next to me
He gon' bring my blessings to me, I know it!

[Intro: Willow Smith & Will Smith]
Daddy can you tell me a story?
Oh you wanna hear a story?
What kind of story you wanna hear baby?
A scary story

[Verse 1: Will Smith]
Oh, ok
Once upon a time there was a kid who wanted nothin' more than to rhyme
Almost like he was born in the rhyme
He thought of his rhymes almost all of the time
And he fought with his mom
His school getting caught with his rhyme book
And he knew he shouldn't of took it there in the first place
At least he shouldn't of been sittin lookin there in her face with it
Teacher told him get it out of her class
Wicked witch, trick told him that's probably why he won't pass
Now if you shy you won't last, which he knew
So underneath his breath before he left he said
"I'm a be richer then you"
"What you say?", she said
"What you mean?", he said
"Boy don't you play", she said
"What you mean?", he said. Damnit
Ten minutes later standin up in the principles office
Getting handed the phone clammed up cause his father was talking
And he was pissed he wasn't listening to his son
"You testing me? You messin' up again?
You done boy"

[Hook: Will Smith]
This is just a story about a young man comin' up in the rap game
A real scary story
Went from rags to riches it got goblins in it haters and witches
This is just a story about a young man comin' up in the rap game
A real scary story
Went from rags to riches it got goblins in it haters and witches

[Verse 2: Will Smith]
First thing he did was find somebody to give him some money
He wasn't stupid but wasn't using his senses honey
The guy's he meant was a little shady, a little funny
But they gave him the money so they played the record company
It sounds silly but when he grew up in Philly rhymin wasn't what it is today
Deals wasn't a dime a dozen
Today every sister, uncle, or mom or cousin gotta record deal
But for real it wasn't like that then
As you could imagine when he started risin to fame and fortune he was
Havin Started antagonizing them guy's he was with
At the same time he started realizing
The deal that he got from them guys in his eyes didn't fly with size of his hits
He called a meeting to find a solution
He said I'm gettin beat out of my loot
And I'm not recording no more until we find a solution
The dude said we found a solution it's this .44
He ran for the door a little shaken
But the next day he found a lawyer, told him the situation
He said I'm breakin this contract for ya
He said how much the lawyer said I'm a charge you a quarter cause I like you
Just do me a favor
Get your life in order

[Hook: Will Smith]

[Will Smith]
Original - a first form from which varities arise
An authentic work of art as opposed to an imitation, or reproduction

[Verse One: Will Smith]
Why should I try to sound like y'all sound?
That's what's wrong with the rap game right now
Man it's like a circus with a bunch of clowns
With a bunch of cliques I'll probably rap circles around
I spit heat rock, and I ain't talkin rollin
Soon as the beat knock I'm crown controllin
When I hear y'all that's an awful sound
I don't ride beats, I take 'em off the ground
Land 'em somewhere, show 'em the town
Even on foreign ground let 'em know I'm around
I don't follow e'rybody when it's time to rap
At one time e'rybody thought the world was flat
Sounds like you? That was my intention
I paid dues, now dudes pay attention
I live for it, even though the flicks is hittin
Crib's sick, you can see the booth from the kitchen
Speak on it, cause I saw it happen
This is hip-hop, dawg I ain't just rappin
Y'all lookin at a real MC man
You couldn't check a mic from me

[Hook: Will Smith]
Why should I try to sound like y'all sound?
That's what's wrong with the rap game right now
Why should I try to flow, the way y'all flow
Or do a show like y'all show, nah that ain't where my head at now
Y'all in the hip-hop lost and found
That's what's wrong with the rap game right now
Man it's like a circus with a bunch of clowns
With a bunch of cliques I'll probably rap circles around

[Verse Two: Will Smith]
Let's talk about rhyme capability
Let's talk about hip-hop versatility
Let's talk about takin the game beyond
How the hell we gon' have a battle of wits? Trick you unarmed
Let's talk about love for the game
I mean real love, back before there was fame
I'm real with it, I ain't claimin to reign
But when y'all talk about rap, y'all gon' start sayin my name
F'real though, I ain't playin
Plenty of y'all love a brother, just scared to say it
Yo, first ever rap Grammy
Let's talk about the only reason yo' ass went to Miami - yup!
Truck with rims - check; throwback jersey - check
Champagne bottles - check; lots of models - DAMN!
That's the list for 90% of y'all videos and songs
Am I WRONG?!

[Hook: Will Smith]
Why should I try to sound like y'all sound?
That's what's wrong with the rap game right now
Why should I try to flow, the way y'all flow
Or do a show like y'all show, nah that ain't where my head at now
Y'all in the hip-hop lost and found
That's what's wrong with the rap game right now
Man it's like a circus with a bunch of clowns
With a bunch of cliques I'll probably rap circles around

[Verse Three: Will Smith]
Lost - when you a slave to the biz
With no care for the cost of what you sayin to kids
Found is when your lyrics are a test of time
And your mind hear that your spirit is blessed divine
Lost is when you rhyme 'til your throat gets sore
But you don't even believe what you say no more
Found is when you bleed heart into the mic
And the pain you sustain it could change a life
Lost is when you hide behind the freedom of speech
Well sure you're free to do it, but what it mean to do it
Did you mean to do it? Did you need to do it?
Did you take time to think about the seed you ruined? (HUH?)
Found is Esco, Dead Prez and them
Found is Lauryn Hill
Found is Rakim
Found can be you if you felt the message
And ask yourself this question

[Hook: Will Smith]
Why should I try to sound like y'all sound?
That's what's wrong with the rap game right now
Why should I try to flow, the way y'all flow
Or do a show like y'all show, nah that ain't where my head at now
Y'all in the hip-hop lost and found

[Intro]
Big Willie!
Get on the floor!

[Hook]
Ohh! I'm the party starter
You might have a good time but we party harder
So, tell the DJ to play my song
And we can dance all night to the early morning

[Verse 1]
Dance, an afrodesiac
Women gyrating, simulating sensual acts
To stimulatin musical tracks
I thought I was just gon' come out at night and get a brew and relax
But no! Uh-uh, when you the party starter
It's like, you on call, you what the doctor ordered
It's like you gotta block the border to the door and
Shock 'em when it's boring, get on the floor!
Uhh, it's the groovicide bomber
Mic in my vest tight, strapped to my chest like
I'm a run up in the party holla and
Be like, oh! Fulfilling my calling
Big, Will, that's my name
Writing, rhymes, that's my game
Ask me again and I'll tell you the same
Look, just write your number right next to your name girl

[Hook]
Ohh! I'm the party starter
You might have a good time but we party harder
So, tell the DJ to play my song
And we can dance all night to the early morning

[Verse 2]
He was raised in the days when the roof was raised and
Every rap occasion, new and amazing
The back of the stage is amazed and gazing
Praying for the day they can one day praise him
Studied the ways of the game and made it
Came through the maze and the haze and played it
Perfect, dazed any person hated
And cursed 'em, he was unfazed, he waited
It was worth it, he never retaliated
He saved it, slaving, on the road blazing
Dazed when he was low, nothing could raise him
And came to the show and something uncaged in him
Like the pope of this party crusade
I'm like braids, that's never gon' fade, ya heard?
I'm like, 23's on an Escalade
Throw me into the rave like you threw a grenade, boom!

[Hook]
Ohh! I'm the party starter
You might have a good time but we party harder
So, tell the DJ to play my song
And we can dance all night to the early morning

[Verse 3]
I call for the days of the unadulterated
When the artistry was cultivated
You know back when rap was smart and multi-layered
We can rap without A&R's and ultimatums, damn!
Now today I say the praise, I long for the good old days
When the party was all about partying
I was a mini-party starter then
My mind bends when I call my pen
The big question, should I run to mine a vittle
Food for thought or, dumb the rhyme a little?
But Will if you come too high
That'll alienate folks, and they won't buy it
Yo, look, people getting trapped in the track
And they be clapping, even when the rappin is wack
And what happened? When did we get happy with that?
He old-fashioned? Yup! Well let's be happy he back, ya heard me?

[Hook]
Ohh! I'm the party starter
You might have a good time but we party harder
So, tell the DJ to play my song
And we can dance all night to the early morning

[Will Smith]
Mic check, one two one two
This dedicated to an old friend of mine, Michelle
She a holy roller now, turned over a new leaf
Now e'rything old gon' burn (please help me not do it again)

[Hook: Will Smith]
Ms. Holy Roller, new angel
Wit'cha bible out shoutin and you ringin a bell
Mid-life, REBORN! And can't wait to tell
If I don't believe what you believe I'm goin to hell

[Verse One: Will Smith]
Yo, I've been down with Jesus since Sunday school and Easter speeches
The, bible was survival that's what my grandma would teach us
Since I was 5 I've been dyin and tryin to read it
And when I did, it redefined it
Now you was 34 when you found Jesus after your life fell to pieces
Wife two times with two guys, now enlightening speeches
Seem to flow out your mouth with the hype of a preacher
Took your whole life to reach ya, now I'm a triflin creature?

[Hook: Will Smith]
Ms. Holy Roller, new angel
Wit'cha bible out shoutin and you ringin a bell
Mid-life, REBORN! And can't wait to tell
If I don't believe what you believe I'm goin to hell

[Will Smith]
C'mon, if I die right this second, I reckon that God
Would simply check into my life and times, dissectin my rhymes
He'll see how I've been leadin his troops
You can't do dirt your whole life and say - OOPS!

[Interlude: Will Smith]
Now where was Jesus when you was cheatin and you was deceivin me?
Where was Jesus when you was greedy, your lawyers was bleedin me?
Where was Jesus when every weekend, a new man was livin wit'chu
Oh wait, he was with me, tryin to keep me from killin you!
Now where was Jesus when you was lyin and you was betrayin me?
When I was tryin to make it and you was hatin delayin me huh?
Where was Jesus when the ICE was thrillin ya?
Oh wait, he was with me, tryin to keep me from killin ya!

[Verse Two: Will Smith]
If I ain't know Jesus, ain't no tellin where I would be
It's been nights I felt like faeces, I needed to fight to release it
I'm in the limelight, it's hot and the heat is ceaseless and
Holdin my tongue while lil' bums cut me to pieces
The only reason's cause I studied the life of Jesus and
Ventin with my pen and intendin to write and release it
But when an ex-friend slight me and slam me with venom
I hate it, I can't stand, damn it I really resent it
I always strive to be righteous, my version of God
The reason why I never write rap verses with curses inside
The reason I never purposely hurt persons I've applied
Many teachings of God, searchin the reaches of God
Pondered the mysteries of why you be dissin me
I adore you, all I hope for you is freedom from misery
You made mistakes and blunders, you breakin from under but yo
If I'm goin to hell, it's makin me wonder

[Interlude: Will Smith]
The greatest atrocities ever committed on this planet have been in the name of God
This country was founded by the Puritans for the express purpose of oppression free worship
Your attitude is the same arrogant fearful fundamentalism
That fueled the hatred, of the Crusades and the attacks of 9/11
If we are not allowed to worship God as groups and individuals free from persecution
And respect for tolerance, there's only one outcome

[Hook: Will Smith]
Ms. Holy Roller, new angel
Wit'cha bible out shoutin and you ringin a bell
Mid-life, REBORN! And can't wait to tell
If I don't believe what you believe I'm goin to hell, yo
Ms. Holy Roller, new angel
Wit'cha bible out shoutin and you ringin a bell
Mid-life, REBORN! And can't wait to tell
If I don't believe what you believe I'm goin to hell

[Verse One: Will Smith]
From a distance
You can witness, the glow from my entourage
Gravitate toward the ambience
See me and my men on CNN
Then the birth of the inevitable hate begin
Cause hate is the child of greatness
That grew between Neo and the Smiths in the Matrix
Yin to the yang, it just must be
Ask anybody with a Grammy or an MVP

[Interlude] + (Will Smith)
I can't stop, get out, I don't need this hate around me
All yo' negativity might drown me
I just try to go hard, doin my job
Stop!  Get out, the whole world love cause I do what I do
And I don't like the energy comin from you
Tryin to play me soft, wave 'em off (I just)

[Hook] + (Will Smith)
Wave 'em off, yeahhh
(I ain't concerned wit'cha hatin, that don't slow down my paper makin)
Wave 'em off, yeahhh (While the whole world recognize)
(You lookin at me with them crooked eyes)
Wave 'em off, yeahhh (Love me I paved the way)
(Boys, we can't behave this way, c'mon)
Wave 'em off, yeahhh (And while the whole world recognize)
(You lookin at me with them crooked eyes)

[Verse Two: Will Smith]
Comin of age, I invaded nations
On stage I seen Haitian or Asian faces
No vacations just more locations
I go places so chasin my vocation
So demonstratin the way to be patient
With life's test, through my IRS situation
My guess is my dedication don't faze ya
A public sensation, in private you hatin, why?
That's so last year, that's so not sexy
But I shall not let the hate stress me
I got bigger fish to fry
I can stand on my wallet probably kiss the sky
When, I close my eyes, I wish that I
Could change how you get pissed when I
Do things you can't deny
Truth is, great do need hate to survive, so I

[Hook] + (Will Smith)
Wave 'em off, yeahhh
(I ain't concerned wit'cha hatin, that don't slow down my paper makin)
Wave 'em off, yeahhh (While the whole world recognize)
(You lookin at me with them crooked eyes)
Wave 'em off, yeahhh (Love me I paved the way)
(Boys, we can't behave this way, c'mon)
Wave 'em off, yeahhh (And while the whole world recognize)
(You lookin at me with them crooked eyes)

[Verse Three: Will Smith]
Block 'em out, ignore em, wave 'em off
Don't pay these jokers no mind, wave 'em off
They just all mad cause they in the coat section
Of the hate train and they can't get off
Still flamin boys, stayin clear of the hatin
Is the best defense, tryin to X-C excellence
Same way hope come with fear
Yo greatness lives here, then hateness lives here
Trust

[Interlude] + (Will Smith)
I can't stop, get out, I don't need this hate around me
All yo' negativity might drown me

[Will Smith]
Intro, the maestro, nice flow
Hot like nitro.. cool as ice though
That type of dichotomy, y'all know it's gotta be
Who else could it be BUT me?
Rub your eyes, behold the Big Williest
Dream supreme beam straight from Philly it's the
Eclectic female attractor
Rapper slash actor, right back at ya
And to the next millenium many come but few are chosen
See me servin like the U.S. Open
Another type of hustler listed at Blockbuster
.. go and ask a movie usher
Who is he? He or she - SFP
Movies, CD's, and TV's, but uh-uh
Cause today I take a break from that
As I roll where a tank of gas'll take me at
I used to rock these red Iroc Z's
Now I rock the MB's with the twelves and V's
Today, sun high.. up in the sky
From N.Y. la la to M.I., just cruisin

[Tichina Arnold]
Where, baby, I don't care (just cruisin)
As long as you take me there (just cruisin)
Somewhere to clear my mind (just cruisin)
Just cruisin

[Will Smith]
Zero to sixty, flossin - 90 degrees
Sony cartridges, ten CD's each
Reach to the beach, Southside leanin
It ain't often I'm off and I'm feenin for the -
- top down, drop down got me hot now
Heated up can't stop now
What up cutie wop? Sure sure is cookin yo
I know I'm spoken for, can't hurt lookin though
Pop CD's, B-I-G's, then 2Pac's
While cruisin the blocks, hittin the hot spots
Got my celly on O-F-F
Golden Arches got my belly goin oh yes yes
So let's just - ease on down ease on down the road
No pager roll my hip as I'm rollin my whip
Cause today I'm on the solo creep
Man, why you think I be workin so hard all week?
I'm just cruisin

[Tichina Arnold]
Where, baby, I don't care (just cruisin)
As long as you take me there (just cruisin)
Somewhere to clear my mind (just cruisin)
Just cruisin (I'm just cruisin)
Where, baby, I don't care (just cruisin)
As long as you take me there (just cruisin)
Somewhere to clear my mind (just cruisin)
Just cruisin

[Will Smith]
Sun settin in the S-K-Y
Must say I've had the best day I'm..
Tryin to find a exit, a place to chill
Not too hectic, so I can spend some time with Will
Let the, sunshine to the moonlight clear my mind
Soul search, see what I find
If I'm bein the best lover and friend
Am I being the best daddy I can?
I pray I am, and I feel good today
Reminisce as I'm cruisin around the way
Roll tight past the park where I used to play
Can't think of a better way to spend my day
Uh, still findin my way, still growin
Petrol blowin, moon soon showin
Gots to get goin, losin the light
And "The Freaks Come Out at Night," right
Just cruisin

[Tichina Arnold]
Where, baby, I don't care (just cruisin)
As long as you take me there (just cruisin)
Somewhere to clear my mind (just cruisin)
Just cruisin (I'm just cruisin)
Where, baby, I don't care (just cruisin)
As long as you take me there (just cruisin)
Somewhere to clear my mind (just cruisin)
Just cruisin

[Will Smith]
Ladies and gentlemen
Thank you very much for comin out this evening
Yeah, thank you thank you
Please, take the dancefloor, uh
I would like to welcome you, to the Switch, remix
Now all you got to do is let your body move
And just - woo!

[Verse One: Will Smith]
Vibe to vibe a second
This a club girl, why you arrived naked?
Hear that, how the veteran glide the record
But don't download, go out and buy the record
Switch - uhh, somethin sexy 'bout her
Girl on the floor, all her friends around her
I mean real clean, ain't gotta touch or nuttin
It ain't like I like a chick on chick or sum'n
I'm just a sucker for a hot track
Gimme a drink and a chick to tell "Stop that"
Dance is a hop then a clap, flip it 'round
Now bring it on back, break it down - now switch

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
I don't want nobody sittin on the wall
If you didn't come to dance then why'd you come at all
Here's your chance (here's your chance) take my hand (take my hand)
Do that dance, girl, now switch

[Verse Two: Will Smith]
Uh - I got a question, I need to ask somebody
Why is it that when y'all see me at the party
Y'all be looking like "Ooh, he a movie star
He ain't supposed to be out on the floor with e'rybody"
But oh wait, whoa y'all forgettin
When I was, amateur spittin before the scripts were written
First one in, last one out the club
Burstin in, passin out in the club
Back at it, this cat is the wit and the charm
Taking you higher like a syringe hittin ya arm
Bringing the fire, making you binge, ring the alarm
Let me see you clap and spin, baby come on - switch!

[Chorus]

[Robin Thicke] + (Will Smith)
I don't want to see you standin
When you look as fine as you (to the left one time girl)
I don't want to see you standin
When you look as fine as you (yo, to the back one time girl)
I don't want to see you standin
When you looks as fine as you (to the right one time girl)
I don't want to see you standin, girl
Look so fine as you (slide it up front, slide it up front)
{left, right, East, West, up, down, North, South} (Robin Thicke)
{left, right, East, West, up, down, North, South} (Big Will, yo)
Look so fine as you babe

[Verse Three: Will Smith]
Keep switchin whether you in your car or your kitchen
Switchin hittin like it's a brand new dancin religion
Chance collision with Robin Thicke advancin my mission
Dance envisioned by my man All Money, keep switchin

[Chorus] - repeat 2X w/ ad libs

[Will Smith]
Ha ha, Big Will
Thank y'all very much for comin out this evenin
The love that I feel, in this room, is beyond, compare

[Intro: Mary J. Blige]
Whyyyyyy, whyyyyyy
Whyyyyyy, whyyyyyy

[Chorus: Will Smith]
I really wish I could explain it baby
It's just the world is kinda crazy baby
Ain't no pretty way to paint it baby
Don't cry, dry your eyes

[Verse 1: Will Smith]
September 11th I woke up about 7 AM
West coast time, french toast and my turkey bacon
Takin my time awakin, turnin my TV on
To my surprise, saw what everybody in the world saw
Me and my children, images were chillin
My son said - daddy were there people in that building?
A cold sweat, frozen with a lump in my chest
I heard his question, couldn't bring my lips to say yes to him
That night at my son's side, he cried
And prayed for the ones who died in the World Trade
His palms to God, seeds of qualms with God
He just, kept on pressin me, wanna know why
Then one week later our bombs were dropped
We seein them, on CNN, they just won't stop
The infrared, images of brutal attack
He said "Daddy now we killin 'em back," right right

[Chorus: Will Smith]
I really wish I could explain it baby
It's just the world is kinda crazy baby
Ain't no pretty way to paint it baby
Don't cry, dry your eyes
I really wish I could explain it baby
It's just the world is kinda crazy baby
Ain't no pretty way to paint it baby
Don't cry, dry your eyes

[Bridge: Mary J. Blige]
Souls are captured (souls are captured)
Dreams are stolen (dreams are stolen)
Hearts are broken (hearts are broken)
Evil plaguin he rewardin
Hate surrender (hate surrender)
Love exaulted! (Love exaulted!)
HOPE ELATED! (HOPE ELATED!)
Negativity DESTROYED AND..

[Verse 2: Will Smith]
Honest to God, why is the bomb always gettin the last word
And why, did her uncles have to molest her
And why, did all them cops have to be shootin to kill?
And why, did all them priests have to act so ill?
Tell me why did James Byrd Jr. have to be touched?
Tell my why did Malcolm and Martin depart from us
Tell me why did the sniper make that little boy shoot
And why, is human life always denied for loot?
Tell me why did Mandela have to live in a cage?
Why did my brother Sterling have to die at that age?
Tell me why did Reginald Denny deserve his fate?
And why the fuck can't love seem to defeat hate?
Tell me why is it so hard for all the children to eat?
Why did 'Pac and Biggie Smalls have to fall in the street?
Tell me why did Jam Master Jay have to go that way?
Please, what am I supposed to say my kids when they say

[Chorus]
I really wish I could explain it baby
It's just the world is kinda crazy baby
Ain't no pretty way to paint it baby
Don't cry, dry your eyes
I really wish I could explain it baby
It's just the world is kinda crazy baby
Ain't no pretty way to paint it baby
Don't cry, dry your eyes

[Verse 3: Will Smith]
Can't explain it baby life is just really crazy
I mean if it's world wars or the life of a little baby
We got more stores than they got rice under buddha lazy
You live four scores and still it be drivin you crazy
But for me I try to see the bright side
Sometimes it be like the goodness be tryin to hide
Or tryin to flee, but it can't, it's deep inside
Sweetie you be the light for others, make 'em believe in God

[Interlude]

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Snoop Dogg, Big Will
Ay lil' homey you need to pump ya brakes
Real talk, we came to have a good time
We ain't got all that time for all that
Man homey look pump ya brakes
Now slide right, and just pump ya brakes
We'll holla at you in a minute
F'real, ha ha pump ya brakes

[Verse 1: Will Smith]
All this excess stress I can't take it
Slow that thing down, pump ya brakes kid
Why you gotta be all up in the face kid?
The ABS'll get you numbers and a name, kid
I mean really, houndin' on girl
Was that really necessary, see your itinerary
Is all off, you need to be hauled off
She start flippin, she ain't trippin, it's your loss
This a simple case of a anti-brake pumper
You don't have to talk to women bumper to bumper
That mighta got you a couple numbers when you were younger
But dude switch your whole approach, that ain't proper
Be a gentleman and try to be gentle man
The essence of stimulation mental man
But if you actin like you just got out a kennel man
Put your foot on the pedal and, pump

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
If your girl in your face then she out of place
What you need to tell her is pump ya brakes
Now if you out but your girls they pressin' you hard
What you need to tell 'em is pump ya brakes
Now if you underage and you actin all grown
What you need to do is pump ya brakes
If you offended by this record and you know it's you
What you need to do is pump ya brakes

[Verse 2: Will Smith]
Outside the restaurant, girl sees boy
Girl likes boy, girl meets boy (Boy)
Boy doesn't know that girl thinks he's fly (Fly)
Boy's a nice guy so boy says hi (Hi)
Boy's girlfriend returns from going to park
She sees them together this ignites a spark (What?)
Boy's girlfriend has a real loud bark
Now this is where the pumping of the brakes should start
Girlfriend thinks that somethin's goin' on
Girl tells girlfriend nothin's goin' on
Boy in the middle of the commotion beginnin'
Girlfriend mad cause boy keeps grinnin'
Now why is he grinnin'? But that's beside the point
Girlfriend she chill 'fore they rolled up in the joint
Jumpin to conclusions get you nowhere honey
Pump ya brakes or be a crash test dummy

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
If your girl in your face then she out of place
What you need to tell her is pump ya brakes
Now if you out but your girls they pressin' you hard
What you need to tell 'em is pump ya brakes
Now if you underage and you actin all grown
What you need to do is pump ya brakes
If you offended by this record and you know it's you
What you need to do is pump ya brakes

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Rule number one, is just like two
The who-dos and what-nots and what you should dizzoo
No loud talkin', no back talkin'
If you do either believe it you back walkin'
I hate to sound rude but then again I have to
My rap bang and my mack game it'll smack you
Click-clack you, spit at you
I don't do it cause I want to, I do it cause I get to
I gotta question to ask you
Would you fall, stand tall, ball, or let him smash you?
If I was you, and you was I
Would you keep it G, or would you stay fly?
If you was rich, in a ditch, livin low, would you push the button
Keep it cuttin, or would you just let it go?
Calm down lil' homie
And know what you dealin wit before you run up on me

[Hook: Snoop Dogg]
If your girl in your face then she out of place
What you need to tell her is pump ya brakes
Now if you out but your girls they pressin' you hard
What you need to tell 'em is pump ya brakes
Now if you underage and you actin all grown
What you need to do is pump ya brakes
If you offended by this record and you know it's you
What you need to do is pump ya brakes
It's the Freshman
Big Willie
Uh

[Chorus x 2]
I'ma make you dance all night (I'm the party starter)
You gonna break a sweat (I'm the party starter)
I don't care what you heard
I don't care where you been
A party ain't a party till I get there

[Verse 1]
Dance, an aphrodisiac
Women gyrating, simulating sensual acts
To stimulating musical tracks
I thought I was just gon' come out tonight & get a brew & relax
But no! Uh uh, when you're the party starter
It's like you're on call, you're what the doctor ordered
It's like you gotta block the border to the door
& shock 'em when it's boring...
GIT ON THE FLOOR!!
Ughh, it's the groovicide bomber, mic in my vest
Tight, strapped to my chest
Like, I'ma run up in the party hollerin'
& be like "Ohhh!", fulfillin' my callin'
Big! (Big), Will! (Will), that's my name! (whoop)
Writin' rhymes, that's my game! (whoop)
Ask me again and I'll tell you the same! (whoop)
Just write ya number down right next to ya name, girl

[Chorus x 2]
I'ma make you dance all night (I'm the party starter)
You gonna break a sweat (I'm the party starter)
I don't care what you heard
I don't care where you been
A party ain't a party till I get there

[Verse 2]
He was raised in the days when the roof was raised
Every rap occasion, new & amazing
The back of the stage amazed and gazin'
Prayin for the day they would one day praise him
Studied the ways of the game & made it
Came through the maze & the haze & played it perfect
Days any person hated & cursed him, he was unfazed
He waited, it was worth it, he never retaliated
He saved it, slavin', on the road blazin'
Days when he was low, nothin' could raise him
He came to the show & somethin' uncaged in him
Like the pope, but its party crusade
I'm like braids that's never gon'
Fade (ya heard)
I'm like, 23's on an Escalade, throw me into the rave
Like you threw a grenade - BOOM!!

[Chorus x2]
I'ma make you dance all night (I'm the party starter)
You gonna break a sweat (I'm the party starter)
I don't care what you heard
I don't care where you been
A party ain't a party till I get there

[Verse 3]
I call for the days of the unadulterated
When the artistry was cultivated
You know, back when rap was smart and multilayered
We could rap without A&Rs& ultimatums (damn)
Now today I could say I long for the days when the party was all about partyin'
I was a mini-party starter then
My mind bends when I call my pen
The big question should I run the mind a vittle
Food for thought or dumb the rhyme a little
But Will "if you come to high that'll alienate folks & they won't buy it"(yo)
Look, people getting trapped in the track
& they be clappin', even when the rappin' is wack
Yo, what happened, when did we get happy wit that?
He's old-fashioned (yup), but let's be happy he's back
(Ya heard me!)

[Chorus x 2]
I'ma make you dance all night (I'm the party starter)
You gonna break a sweat (I'm the party starter)
I don't care what you heard
I don't care where you been
A party ain't a party till I get there

[Jermaine Dupri]
Yeah
{*imitates scratching*}
Come on
See y'all know me
Y'all know the name
What?
How it goes down
How I play the game
Get jiggy with it
Uh hun
See y'all know me
Y'all know the name
Uh huh
Get jiggy with it
How it goes down, how I play the game

[Verse 1: Will Smith]
You want me to drop
You gots to cripple me
Cause while y'all
Fake ball, I go triple P
Tommy Mottola and Spielberg tearing me checks
While you talkin' a lot of talk and ain't seen gold yet
Much less a baguette
Or the chain to go with it
In weak words, ya done spit in ya nonsense rhymes
I probably heard six time (Why?)
Cause I'm the Williest
Think your stack can match mine
Now you the silliest
From Philly, it's the M-A, N in, B-L
A-C-K, now watch the playa parle
A nightmare to all haters
Cribs with elevators
Cooks and waiters
Servin' me and Jada, now you afraid of
The box-office assassin
Yeah, they say I'm
Hot to death, but in London, they say I'm smashin'
Chi-Chi-O, don't quit it
Big Will
With the remix, still
Gettin' jiggy with it
Chorus:

[Sample]          "The Williest, from Philly it's"

[Will Smith & JD] See y'all know me
Y'all know the name

[Sample]          "The Williest, from Philly it's"

[Will Smith & JD] This is how it goes down
And how I play the game

[Sample]          "The Williest, from Philly it's"

[Will Smith & JD] See y'all know me
Y'all know the name

[Sample]          "The Williest, from Philly it's"

[Jermaine Dupri]  How it goes down
And how I play the game

[Verse 2: Big Punisher]
We gettin' jiggy with it
Puff in Philly so you can really feel it
Pun and Willy, we gon' get it just like Biggie did it
We're still committed to gettin' paid, gettin' 

[{*laid*}]
In the shade
Hittin' the maid the Bill Clinton way
Now we sippin' Don and Jade down to Cancun
Me and my man Tune, actin' a fool, National Lampoon
Lancruisin' in the stretch Benz
Since me and Fresh Prince been best friends
And Benji's like
Chestlen
Them cats near over there
Diamond border in the air
With the chauffeur by the Range Rover of the year
I'm still feared cause you love to hate
Judge my fate
S'why being a thug is great
Ain't no playa hatin' (Hatin')
You regulatin' all you say, you're nathan
Claimin' to Mason's, but I still keep ya whole face in
Standin' ovation when you see me
Big amo B.P
Call me a rano Cubano, we don't che-cheat
Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: R.O.C.]
It's Newark's finest
Cops stake out
Tryin' to find us
We in the Bahamas
Hidin' in 

[{*vaginas*}]
We like to talk wild, flash dough and spill drinks
Bright ice like lightbulbs in the links
Sold out seats inside the Coliseum
Ritz and college gleamin'
Got chicks screamin'
Intrigued by the player I be, switch fatigued
On Wednesday, it's the army
Next day, Armani
So how y'all gonna harm me
I lay y'all calmly
Until the here rapter
R.O.C. the top rapper
You cocked, but miss more shots, than the Raptors
Only thing you can fill me with
Is laughter
Ha ha ha
Y'all playas won't get far
Tryna stop me
R dot O dot C, R.O.C
D-4-5-0, calico flow
While I have y'all know, I'm jiggy with this here
Come on

[Cam'ron]
Uh
Will Smith, get jiggy with me
JD, get jiggy with it
Big Pun, get jiggy with it
That's right, that 

[{*nigga*}] R.O.C., gettin' jiggy with it
Killa Cam, get jiggy with it
Uh
Harlem World, get jiggy with it
Uh
Killa Cam'll get jiggy with it
Believe that, (???) get jiggy with it

[Verse 4: Cam'rom]
C-A-M-R-O-N, I get Jig
But usually in the back of the hooptie, ready to split wigs
Pain's inflicted a menace since leather bombers
And letter Farmers
Head and pajamas, a bed of piranhas
I'm better with llamas
Uh huh, nice aroma
My jewels like gloves, you could call 'em Isotoner (Ice-a-toners)
All over the map
Condo and hatch
Borrow the match
Real ballers like Alonzo and Shaq
And how could you not know
Mase is multi
Diss us, y'all all try
But y'all are small fry
And I never, been to Bel Air, cause I'm from St. Elsewhere
Where 

[{*niggas*}], get money
And they pay rent by welfare
They despise money
And them guys are funny
That's why I keep it movin' like the Energizer bunny
And if your pies are crummy
That'll be a pity
Cause I will, get gritty, just to get jiggy (Get jiggy...)

[Will Smith]
Uh, uh, uh
What?
Whoo! Ha-ha
Yeah mic check
Mic, mic, mic, mic, mic, mic, mic, mic
Alright now let's go yo

[Lil' Kim](Will)
Here come the butter baby
(I bring it smooth and hot)
Here come the butter baby
(Bringing it smooth and hot)
Here come the butter baby
(I bring it smooth and hot)
What? What? What? What?

[Will Smith]
Here come the butter baby
Bringing it smooth and hot
Got the staff from K-B
Singing this groove a lot
So I got my spiral notebook
Drink and pen
And then abracadabra y'all, done it again
Married but I flirt a little
Siking the ladies
In the videos I be bringing it like Mike in the 80s
Level of success based on my level of risk
You've been yelling for the lyricist
Then reveling this
Old school hip-hop a beat and a rhyme
Some chapters and some verses, you seek and you find
Look no further here I go, Big Will, Johnny Inferno
Flame by hip-hop burns eternal
All aboard on my train to fame
Rappers hoping that it'd rain
Trying to stop the game
But rain can't stop me
I got a coat in the crib
Hey look y'all yellow bricks quit beefin' at the whiz, what?

[Lil' Kim](Will)
Here come the butter baby
(I bring it smooth and hot)
Here come the butter baby
(Uh, bringing it smooth and hot)
Here come the butter baby
(I bring it smooth and hot)
What? What? What? What?
(Lil' Kim y'all what?)

[Lil' Kim]
Lil' Kim, Big Will give a damn how y'all feel
Hate, but on the real, Big Will is seven mill
If I wasn't on top I'd have a lot less ends
I'd most likely have a lot less friends
You know what I learned, let them keep talking
Uh-huh, pull up in an Azure and watch them keep walking

[Will Smith]
Kim haters be making me wanna flip and react

[Kim]
No-no-no, chill Will and let me do that (alright)
Huh, I gotta eat can't get with broke cats
You know the queen like to be where the money at
I'm the mother, y'all like adopted in this
Call us Mr. and Mrs. Papadapolis
When will y'all learn?
Y'all just interns
You gon' get what you earn, just wait your turn
I rock telephones with the TV screens
So I can have real phone sex
Know what I mean?

[Lil' Kim](Will)
Here come the butter baby
(I bring it smooth and hot)
Here come the butter baby
(Bringing it smooth and hot)
Here come the butter baby
(Yo I bring it smooth and hot)
What? What? What? What?

[Will Smith]
It's the fun king, I've been doing one thing
Running things for years, give me one swing
And it's out of here, crack!
Over the fence ladies and gents
Keeping rappers impressed but depressed by my current events

[Kim]
Yes Lord!

[Will]
Big Will swinging the best sword
What'cha flexing for, don't be testing me boy
Messing with me boy, you're stepping on the root of a daisy
I have you're girl saying

[Kim]
Will why you do that to my baby?
Yo Will, what they looking stupid in the face for?
What? I can't have rocks the size of a baseball
Trust me when I cop I make sure mine cut glass
Never spend my last, like a crack head for the blast
Y'all can kiss my ass acting like you know me
You ain't got a Rolley, take this one here you owe me
All in together now, wrists looking better now
Screw greyhound bound, I'm getting cheddar now

[Will]
Burrrr! When she step up in the scene!
Who! Ice gleam, y'all scream, "Bow to the Queen!"
Ring on her finger mad phat
Leonardo DiCaprio saw it and caught a flashback
*mouth noise*
All you rappers wanna snap, Jazzy Jeff got my back
*mouth noise*
Lil' Kim bring it back, Lil' Kim press the rack

[Lil' Kim]
Yeah I'm short and sexy, my love's divine
My name is QB and I blow your mind with the
*mouth noise*
When I step up, body lookin' hot
All the music just stop

[Intro: Will Smith (Tra-Knox)]
Uh, Uh, I'm comin'...
Watch ya back, I'm comin...
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...)
Big Will for the Y2K, ugh

[Verse One: Will Smith]
Feel the Earth tremble, see the skies turn red
Eclipses, shooting stars, turn ya head
Volcanoes erupted, rage in the sea
Ain't the second coming of Christ
It's the first coming of me
They say if you damn up the Nile
It would throw off the rotation of the Earth
Well, messing with me is worse
Feel the rain, button up you overcoat
Watch the illadelph bad boy go quote for quote
Well, ya'll want the best, well, I'm right here
You looking for competition, ain't no one there
Ya'll in the stands dissin', kickin' dirt and missin'
My heavenly flow put MC's in hell's kitchen, ugh
And I'm so, I'm so hot, hot, ya'll burnin' up, HOT
I step in, it's like the wedding between Hope and Armaggedon
The Hip Hop Moses to where we headin' y'all

[Chorus: Will Smith (Tra-Knox)]
I'm comin', I'm comin' (Comin'... comin')
You can't stop me, you can't stop me!
I'm comin', I'm comin' (Comin'... comin')
Can't hold me back! Uh uh (Yeah, I'm comin', oh!!)
I'm comin', I'm comin' (Comin'... comin')
You can't stop me, you can't stop me (Oh no, no, no...)
I'm comin', I'm comin'...

[Verse Two: Will Smith]
When I was born there was a rainbow formed with no sun
Roy G Biv marking the path for the chosen one
An angel, my grandma, told me before she died
Smart folks don't need to put no cursing in they rhymes
So from CD to TV to movies back to rhymin'
My lifestats makes Jordan's six rings look common
Ya'll hate, I retaliate, just by being great
Big Will the enemy of your mental state
With the same rhyme I used to burn your idol in a battle
To screw you into saying, "Look, I don't wanna battle"
M.I.B., WB mad respect
Black stealthbombarama, radar can't detect that
I'm comin' is what I screamed
As a teen armed with discipline, faith, and a dream
After smoke clears, after life's roller coasters
See who stands putting his mic into his holster, what!

[Chorus: Will Smith (Tra-Knox)]
I'm comin', I'm comin' (Comin'... comin')
You can't stop me, you can't stop me! (No no, no no)
I'm comin', I'm comin' (Comin'... comin')
You can't hold me back! Uh uh (You can't hold me back...)
I'm comin', I'm comin' (Comin'... comin')
You can't stop me, you can't stop me
I'm comin', I'm comin'...

[Verse Three: Will Smith]
Batton down the hatches and latch the doors
You wanna try to match my whits with yours
Three hits, I hit you, you hit the floor
This track is the third hit, that's for sure
Beat thick reminiscin' of a bodacelli
I'm like a cheetah huntin' out on the Serengeti
I got my X-ray vision through all in my way
No Plan B, it distracts from Plan A
Stay splitting in half, earthquake style
Evacuate your premises, the hardcore nemesis
I never miss, my flow never flawed
Grab mics and send electric shocks through the cord
Quest for the rings my only weapon's intuition
My future position is determined by past decisions
So young George Bush, I'm thinking bout runnin'
Maybe not this time, but trust dude, uh

[Chorus: Will Smith (Tra-Knox)]
I'm comin', I'm comin' (Comin'... comin')
You can't stop me, you can't stop me! (You can't stop me...)
I'm comin', I'm comin' (Comin'... comin')
You can't hold me back! Uh uh (Can't hold me back, no...)
I'm comin', I'm comin' (Comin'... comin')
You can't stop me, you can't stop me (Ohhh...)
I'm comin', I'm comin'... (Oh oh! Oh oh!)
You can't hold me back! Uh uh

I'm comin', I'm comin' (Comin'... comin')
You can't stop me, you can't stop me! (You can't stop me...)
I'm comin', I'm comin' (Comin'... comin')
You can't hold me back! Uh uh (Can't hold me back, no...)
I'm comin', I'm comin' (Comin'... comin')
You can't stop me, you can't stop me (You can't stop me...)
I'm comin', I'm comin'...
You can't hold me back!

Quintessential megalomaniac what's my rap name
Big Will I'm the man
Not conceited I'm as good as I say I am

[Note: This track occurs during the fade of "Potnas"]

[Will Smith]
So dad, like did you like have real good friends
And Potnas when you was growing up?

[Will Sr.]
I had two real good friends all the way through high school

[Will] Who you had?

[Will Sr.] Thomas Jones and Jacob Curtis Jones

[Will] Were they like brothers?

[Will Sr.] Well they weren't brothers
They just had the same last name as Jones
And everybody thought that I was a Jones too
But I wasn't, of course, I was a Smith

[Will] ...Right

[Will Sr.] But they thought I was a Jones
They called us the "Jones Boys", we were so tight
Matter of fact I had a call from one of them...

[Will abruptly interrupts]
Hey Dad listen, check this record out!

[Will and Will Sr. laughs as beat begins]

[Will Smith]
It was a dark night, I had just sparked the mic
Brought the light, to the crowd
In Hampton, it was amped when
I finished with, "Brand New Funk"
They were screaming out, "DO SUMMERTIME!!"
Some of them was drunk, some of the time
I like to chill after the show
But tonight, yo, I wanna get ILL after the show
And there she is
Five-sumthin', short hair, DAMN she live!
The girls get thicker further down '95
I expressed to her, sort of confessed to her
I wanted to get next to her
So I suggested to her, we ROLL...
To suite one ten, sweet ones in
My room, Jeff in one eleven with a friend then
BOOM BOOM BOOM, who dat?
(Open the door!!) Why they do that?
Threw back, by the noise
Some dude and his boys
You know them? Your boyfriend?
More like an annoyed friend
Peep through the peephole
Peeped him and all his peo-ple
That's when Charlie creep through
"Boy, you wanna see WHO?!
Don't nobody wanna meet you!"
Damn, here come the beef stew
"My beef ain't with you (uh-uh), my beef's with Will
So, see Mack, ease back, 'fore yo' cap get peeled"
Charlie said, "Any beef with Will is, plenty beef with me"
And whenever Charlie get mad, he step to the streets he see the...
End of the story, you, wonder who survived?
Get my "He's The DJ..." album, CHECK TRACK FIVE

Chorus:

Everybody need a partner

Girl, when the night's cold and I'm warm
Holding the fact, that I got you holding my back
When my feelings stealing the blue of the sky
Leaving them gray, girl you the sun the brighten up my day
When it seem like the hill to steep and my vision getting blurry

Chorus 2X
Damn

[Woman]
Hey this is me, I'm not in right now
But if you leave your name and your number
I'll just might think about calling you back
Have a pleasant day

[Verse One]
Pick up the phone girl, I know that you home
Please don't leave me all alone with just the sound of this tone
Come on pick up, pick up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up
I know I don't deserve it cause of how I messed up
But alright cool, sit and listen
I'm missing your kiss and now a tear drop glistens
I had a bit to drink, kinda threw me
Things just happened, she didn't mean nuttin' to me
You know me baby, I'm still that same man
That asked for your hand, and still the same plan
Another brother falls by the wayside
Another brother falls by the play side
I knew ever since I was a kid
That I was going to pay the piper for the things I did
But now there is no more us, no more we
No more nuttin' girl damn and it's all cause of me

[Chorus]
No more late nights watching tv
No more talks on the phone till three
No more playing in the leaves in the fall
No more piggy back rides in the mall
No more ice cream cones to share
No more sittin' just playin' in your hair
No more picnics out by the sea
There ain't no more nuttin' and it's all cause of me

[Verse Two]
Damn, some brothers yeah we huff and we puff
Cause when we're hurtin' inside, we gots to front like we tough
But that's dangerous, to cover hurt with hard
Because you still get scared through that feeble facade
Then the bonds of your ego, when the shackles of manhood
Makes you lose something thats damn good
A picture in my mind of us hand and hand walking
So alive, now I'm a dead man talking
Why can't you just pick it up so we can sit and just talk
Why can't you meet me somewhere so we can go take a walk
I can't hide, air, land, or sea
Cause everytime I turn around, there I be
When I was with you I felt free
Now I'm in a cage called me
Now I see, no more us, no more we
No more nuttin' girl damn, and it's all cause of me

[Chorus x2]
No more late nights watching tv
No more talks on the phone till three
No more playing in the leaves in the fall
No more piggy back rides in the mall
No more ice cream cones to share
No more sittin' just playin' in your hair
No more picnics out by the sea
There ain't no more nuttin' and it's all cause of me

[Intro]
(let's listen to this dramatic show
Which was popular in the early days of radio)

[Will Smith]
Ha ha, unh, yeah yeah
Jazzy Jeff, Fresh Prince and uh
Jazzy Jeff, Fresh Prince and uh
Little taste of the old school
Jazzy Jeff, yo, break it down one time
Say what?
Unh, unh, unh, unh

[Verse 1: Will Smith]
One for the treble, two for the bass
Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince back up in your face
Me and Jeff again, "Oh my" you say
1985 to the Y2K
The new millenium, propehicies, I'm fulfillin' 'em
Everywhere I go, people be yelling "yo, that's Will and them"
(so fresh)
I check the rhyme like Quest
Some jokes dropped them doo-doo rhymes at my rest
The B-I-G, W-I-L-L
King of swing, and I rock well
The nail in the coffin of your average rapper
Jeff do the ditto for your average scratcher
Stature of a rapper slash actor
Back to the future on wax
The future of rap
Tap like Gregory Hines, read the headlines
Hip-hop's number one son still shines
Cause I'm (so fresh)

[Chorus: Will Smith]
Big Will is (so fresh)
Jazzy Jeff is (so fresh)
West Philly is (so fresh)
Ladies and Gentlemen
Biiiiiz... Marrrr... KIE!

[Verse 2: Biz Markie]
Yes y'all and to the funky beat and
Everytime you hear me rhyme, y'all be freakin'
The B-I-Z will wreck it, R-O-C-K it
You're guaranteed to like me, for what I am sayin'
To all those other emcees that be tryin' to get the info
Forget the rest cause I'm the best, and I'm a nympho-
Maniac, insaniac, I'll put you in a trance and
If you party with me, I'll always keep you dancin'
Always keep it hyper, no matter what type of
Jam, you know I'm fresh in flavor
Yeah, that's right, I'm talkin' 'bout me
The R-K-I-E in the place to be
I recognize and hypnotize, everytime I tenderize
I specialize and open eyes, to make you realize
That you've been rocked with Jeff's plain skills
The diobolocal, and my man Will
And we're (so fresh)

[Chorus: Will Smith]
Ha, Big Will is (so fresh)
Biz Mark is (so fresh)
Jazzy Jeff is (so fresh)
Biz, do it
Whoo, for the old school
Unh, unh, ha ha
Ladies and gentlemen
Rrricky... D!

[Verse 3: Slick Rick]
Well once upon a time eccentric head shorty
Where people wore pyjamas and went to bed early
There was a little boy, tight clout that might sprout
Tried to help lead black folk the right route
Delayed
Negative voices, many, once in prison for unwise choices that he once
Made*
Divide the men, cops were sent inside of him
And seeing the good he had within him, let him out again
The life no longer for a big time baller, vic
Big Willies like Will Smith now call the kid (yo Rick)
So check the gift, everything consecutive
That's what happens when you steer black folk away from
Negative*
Not to mention chasin' charts, killin' 'em
There'll be a member of the Biz-Mark, Will, and Rick
Demise sent, can't mess with the mindset
Come run with us, December 1999 said
It's all because of you, I'm feelin' sad and blue
You went away, now my life is just rainy days
I love you so, how much, you'll never know
You took your love away from me
Oh oh oh oh
You took your love away from me
Oh oh oh oh
You took your love, you took your love, you took your love
You took your love away from me
Slick Rick
Will Smith
Biz Mark

[Outro: Will Smith]
True dat, true dat
Jazzy Jeff y'all

[Rodney Jerkins]
Darkchild, Big Will, 2000
Bust out, shake it up now
Come on, come on
And shake it up now
Who am I?
You know, you know
Big Will, ya ready?
Come on

[Will Smith]
When I was a lad I used to dream that (one day)
I'd earned the cream that make the rocks gleam
Phat rhymes to make it seem that I was like Bill Gates
Writing lines, seal fates
Power to change the whole set
For exposure or forfeit
And with the wicked sense on how to get the picket fence
Envisioned a hot life, hot wife
Wanted a crib, well a palace like South Fork on Dallas
With lights simmer trees for the ambiance
I been up and down and high and low
Fly with dough, broke looking grimy yo
My shiny glow definitely ain't cause of my Bentley
It's something that my fam put in me
Who am I? You ask
The guy with the razzmatazz with ten duffel bags packed with pazazz
In the past cut twice by the ladies of my life
Boom stitched up by my wife
Who am I?
It's suffice to say found gold in my heart
Put the ice away
Nicer day, live foul homie it's a price to pay
Even when it's rainy still I say it's nice to day
Who am I?
That brother with the platinum plaque
With the strength to stand and say gangsta rap was whack
The fact is that when that brother rap or act
Hold position, front of the pack
Who am I?

[Tatyana Ali]
I be fully educated
Not the one to play with
And I find that some of y'all hate it
But you wanna know baby
Who am I?
I be fully educated
Not the one to play with
And I find that some of y'all hate it
But you wanna know baby
Who am I?

Baby if you really wanna know about me
I'll tell you who I am
I'll tell you I be not the one for games
But if you're right with me
I know I'll do the same

I be fully educated
Not the one to play with
And I find that some of y'all hate it
But you wanna know baby
Who am I?
I be fully educated
Not the one to play with
And I find that some of y'all hate it
But you wanna know baby
Who am I?
(L-Y-T-E)

[MC Lyte]
Who am I?
You dare to ask
The same female who hailed from Brooklyn and wailed on that ass
I'm your worst nightmare, you're best wet dream
Break the bank papi cause we're coming for the cream
And while I'm in the world ain't none of y'all safe
Hold face, sell a million and you still won't equate
So who am I? It ain't hard to tell
Like staying on track cause you thinking I fell
See a lot know my face but a few know me well
Just who I am is the one to make you gel
Who am I? The chick that keeps spittin'
Taking back all my snip that was bitten
Rewritten dangerous laison
With the shades on
Making sure the track stays on
Days on end I'll be that one true friend
That will always be around when the world falls down
I'm honest to the bone
No question, suggestion
You don't wanna know
I give the truth, nothing less than
I'm sweet with a heart to fit
Smart as a whip
You feed me well but I'm still hard to get
I'm like a calculus problem you just can't solve
Study me well if you wanna get involved
And even after that I'm still unpredictable
Now who am I? I'm unforgettable

[Tatyana Ali]
I be fully educated
Not the one to play with
And I find that some of y'all hate it
But you wanna know baby
Who am I?
I be fully educated
Not the one to play with
And I find that some of y'all hate it
But you wanna know baby
Who am I?
I be fully educated
Not the one to play with
And I find that some of y'all hate it
But you wanna know baby
Who am I?
I be fully educated
Not the one to play with
And I find that some of y'all hate it
But you wanna know baby
Who am I?

[Kel Spencer]

[Will Smith]
Been to the mountain top
Down to the valley
Philadelph to Cali
Y'all feel me like Harry felt Sally
Clothes exotic, flows erotic
No jewels that's for them fools who ain't got it
Rap to my own sitcom
Now I just sit calm
Watching y'all respond to my July 4th bomb (boom!)
Yeah I'm a nice kid
But here's some advice kid
Don't get me hyped
I'll set it off like my wife did
Playing down a path like Sajak
Wheel of a Fortune away
Price ain't right I don't play
Find yourself in Jeopardy
The first clue
What is Will Smith?
Hot to death not you
I'm like a Porsche, you a pinto
You like a tiny figurine, I'm monumental
You're like a small get together
On your neighbor's back porch
You know just a couple of y'all
I'm a million man march
Attack of the man in black
Like Jordan playing on a train
Yo my game on track
Mad ice for my wife
No care for what it costed
Had to ease up though
Her wrist got frost bit
My style, flava, delivery, my diction
Gettin' medieval like dude in Pulp Fiction
You want some bring it
Come one, come all, come in
Watch me take they heart away like Penny
I could take 12 rappers and put em' in line
Then 12 emcees that think they can rhyme
Then 12 more brothers that still ain't signed
Then don't do nothing just watch 'em decline
Gangsta hardcore, menace to society
Raps all the same
My pen spits variety
Eclecticism is a virtue
It may not be a word
But it's definitely a virtue
Rappers approaching me all across America
Believe me you don't wanna battle like Erykah
I was in the game before publishing was an issue
You're platinum now but next year I'm gonna miss you
Mad rappers like bad actors should have no parts
Wanna be mad check the charts any of them
Oh you don't see my name
You don't see my spot
Here's a hint
Look closer to the top

[Kel Spencer]
(Uuhhh)
Can you feel it baby?
(Take me away)
Flow crazy
Make em' say
(Uuhhh)
Make It hot, uh
(Take me away)
Flow crazy
Make em' say
Uh (ah) uh (ah) uh (ah) uh (ah)
Uh (ah) uh (ah) uh (ah)

[Kel Spencer]
Uh, love and loyalty yo
Yo the flow spray, Vito say
I'm tryin' to live
And if I catch you out of bounds
It's cheap shots to the ribs
Love and loyalty dawg
Do it how Pac and Big did it
It's the Wild Wild East
And me keepin' me jig with it
Play no games
Thirst to heat the rhyme
Motivation cause procrastination is the thief of time
Holding a torch
I was programmed to scorch
Can't run with the big dawgs?
Then stay on the porch
These cats is craftmatic
Hand on the steering wheel
Rocks from the road dodging oncoming traffic
Man-handle rappers, dismantle rappers
Y'all lukewarm slash sweet-scented candle rappers
Any team posing a threat we defeat those
The wealthy man is the man that knows how to keep dough
As long as y'all play foul I'mma keep hittin' free throws
Crush Spanish mamis calling me Kellito
Remember Lego blocks?
All about the paper now
I use writers block to build sky scraper style
Catch rappers using the same flows everyday cause they lame
True players gotta change their uniform after the game
Y'all seen the flow
Like y'all never seen before
Don't stop for the door
Why do you think green mean gold?
Baby learn life's lessons
Scratch regression
Kel Spence the truth, the answer to all questions
Come on (Uuhhh)

[Will Smith]
Damn Kel, you kind of good

[Hook: Jill Scott]
The little rain drops fallin' down on me
But I can't seem to feel it, feel it
Feel it coming over me

[Verse 1: Will Smith]
The rain gon' come through the window, pain will come
Black, white, rich, poor, it's the same old drum
Rainy days like the war, use wisdom as a weapon
Hold your head up, dry your clothes and keep steppin'
Let the children feel the rain, cause if they feel the rain
From the wetness, they stand to gain
I came into the game, it felt like the middle of June
Music was warm, artists, like flowers, they bloom
Then boom, I shook the room, many felt the thunder
My time to shine, did it like summer
I wondered if the sun would shine forever
Pops said "rain gon' come", to him I said "never"
Cheddar in the genes, face on screens
Got a benz wit' the sheen, but what did it all mean
I earned money and burned money, credit cards smokin'
Platinum, grammys, famous, but still broke and
Not having cash put me in check
Yo, the road to the riches is slippery when wet
Amongst the fall is where you truly find yourself
Ever since then, the rain I never felt
Deal wit' it

[Hook: Jill Scott]
The little rain drops fallin' down on me
But I can't seem to feel it, feel it
Feel it coming over me

[Verse 2: Will Smith]
At age seventeen, the worst pain, a hurrcaine
Her first name still conjuers the rain
Vowed to never let nobody ever get me wet
Lest we forget, love is a four season concept
Many say the rain they can't stand
Never let the weather determine the man
God has a plan, from it I never ran
Follow my heart through the storm, my umbrella in hand
I'm Noah, life's my ark
Forty days and forty nights, still can't take my heart
Seen the fallen man
To dope and liquor brands
The devil'll dance to make it rain
Bringing the pain
Walk through the puddles of struggle on flooded streets
Soakin' wet, but mastered the art of peace
Through grey skies, I grew wise, on bended knees I knelt
Since then, the rain I never felt
What's wit' it

[Hook: Jill Scott]
The little rain drops fallin' down on me
But I can't seem to feel it, feel it
Feel it coming over me

[Verse 3: Will Smith]
Sometimes I sit in my room, stuff on my mind
Stress, can't rest, so I open the blinds
See kids in the streets, runnin' around
It wasn't touchin' 'em, but the rain was comin' down
I wondered how, with my mouth wide
Reminisce of the key, said I wanna go outside
In the rain, to see if the same would happen to me
'Bout that time, God started rappin' to me
He said "pain is the mother of change, the rain must flow
So the seeds of joy might grow
Don't be afraid, find shelter in me
The road to greatness, through the valley of adversity"
I felt the light as He proceeded to drop the gem
These little children, the world we must receive like them
I just smiled, and thanked Him for the cards He dealt
And since then, the rain I never felt
What's wit' it

[Hook: Jill Scott]
The little rain drops fallin' down on me
But I can't seem to feel it, feel it
Feel it coming over me

Gratitude instead a attitude for making ya wait

Brothers always screaming about keeping it real

[Chorus]
Everybody in the front now (whoot, whoot)
Everybody in the back now (whoot, whoot)
Everybody on the side now (whoot, whoot)
La fiesta (whoot, whoot)
All the ladies in da house now (whoot, whoot)
All the fellas in da house now (whoot, whoot)
Everybody in the house now (whoot, whoot)
La fiesta (whoot, whoot)

If I approach you correctly
And step up to you respectfully
Will you please ma'am bless me with the next dance?
I don't intend to offend you
I only intend to befriend you
But you're willing me, thrilling me, killing me
With those hot pants, not a chance
I'mma let you go without saying something
A little hotter in the bottom mama that's all that I'm wanting
No frontin' if it is illegal for you to be that fine
I be McGruff mama taking a bite out of crime
Literally, first it'll be dancing with me
Then it'll be dinner with me
Then it'll be back to my crib
Hold up, I'm about to get ahead of myself
And I'm playing myself
The type of brother that when I'm thinking of stuff
I'm saying the stuff
My bad, back it up let's start with a dance
On good behavior, maybe later
Maybe your apartment, your pad
Sike, joke, walking a tight rope
My foot in my mouth
Look, all I hope is that you'll dance with me
What's up?

[Chorus]
Everybody in the front now (whoot, whoot)
Everybody in the back now (whoot, whoot)
Everybody on the side now (whoot, whoot)
La fiesta (whoot, whoot)
All the ladies in da house now (whoot, whoot)
All the fellas in da house now (whoot, whoot)
Everybody in the house now (whoot, whoot)
La fiesta (whoot, whoot)

She was smiling I was kind wiling
Thinking I was dialin' in
She gave me the impression that she was getting my message
So I'm testing
I through it out there 'Let me buy you a drink'
Cause when I buy you I think it'd be fly if we link
What'cha think?
She responded with a grin and a glance
Then my eyes tried to seduce her to the forbidden dance
The body of a Latin goddess, sexy but modest
The hottest mami chula from Cuba, a cutie with promise
The other night I seen her dancing
Duty was over
She did a split into a spin
And put her leg on his shoulder
And he was over
If that was me and I was he
We'd probably still be dancing
Mami can you feel me?
Still she said nothing
Why she be fronting?
Never seen another mami move like you
Groove like you
I'm saying I wanna dance with you
What's up?

[Chorus]
Everybody in the front now (whoot, whoot)
Everybody in the back now (whoot, whoot)
Everybody on the side now (whoot, whoot)
La fiesta (whoot, whoot)
All the ladies in da house now (whoot, whoot)
All the fellas in da house now (whoot, whoot)
Everybody in the house now (whoot, whoot)
La fiesta (whoot, whoot)

To me when I'm dancing it's aphrodisiatic
It's automatic that I look in your eyes to help fantasize
Some people dance socially not emotionally
Closer to me, come on close as you can be
(Can you feel me?)
Come on mama cut me no slack
(Can you feel me?)
Come on mama forward and back
(Can you feel me?)
Come on mama as hard as you can
It's part of the plan
It happens when you start with the man
On your mark, ready set, baby let's go
Baby let's flow, baby let go
Baby no, no, gotta a lot more
Lettin' it rip, gimme some of that
*girl yells*
Yeah that's it
Sweatin' with me, getting it wetter with me
It's better with me
Gain it, other girls I dated ain't famous
So take it or leave it
Just the way that I eat it
I bring, I swing it
So you like that?
Tell me what's up
Repeat 1 till end

[Intro: K-Ci & Will Smith:]

[Verse 1: Will Smith]
Here it comes the party of a lifetime
31st of December
Man I remember when the ball dropped for 90
Now it's 9-9, ten years behind me
What's gonna happen?
Don't nobody know
We'll see when the clock gets to 12-0-0
Chaos, the cops gonna block the street
Man who the hell cares?
Just don't stop the beat
No time to sleep, yo it's on tonight
K-Ci you feeling me right? (Yeah)
2-0-0-0, the Will 2 K

Hold up it is

[Hook: K-Ci]
Here it comes another year
Come on everyone, new millennium
Here it comes another year
Everyone, new millennium

[Verse 2: Will Smith]
There's a party tonight
Everybody was drinking
The house was screaming
And the bass was shaking
And it won't be long
Till everybody knowing
That twelve o'clock the roof will be blowing
Drinks on me, up the cups, and
Midnight coming full thrust, and
Dick Clark holding it down, and
The second hand rolling around (Na, na, na, na)
Hundred thousands deep, world wide press
Hate to be the man that gotta clean this mess
Same resolution, get the money
Ain't where we've been, it's where we gonna be
Get ready to hum Auld Lang Syne
Cause a person that know the words is hard to find
First soul train line of the year
Four, three, two, one

[Hook: K-Ci & Will Smith]
Its here and I like it
(Whoo! K-Ci y'all, K-Ci y'all)
Gonna pack the dance floor

[Verse 3: Will Smith]
I remember trying to count how old I'd be
When the clock struck twelve in the year 2G
Medianoche finally near
This will be that anthem amongst the cheers
Just the man to usher it in
Big Will bringing the heat
K-Ci bringing the plan
Ringing it in, waiting for the ball to drop
That 2000 vault we breaking the lock
Let hip-hop keep blazing the charts
May the past keep a warm spot in your heart
May the future hold more joy then pain
Hands in the air waiting for confetti to rain

[K-Ci:]
Its here and I like it
Gonna pack the dance floor
Rock the dance floor
Here it comes another year
Come on everyone, new millennium
Here it comes another year
Everyone, new millennium

[Bridge 2: Will Smith]
There's a party tonight
Everybody was drinking
The house was screaming
And the bass was shaking
And it won't be long
Till everybody knowing at twelve o'clock
At 12 o'clock
Say what? Say what? Say what? What?

[Hook: K-Ci]
Here it comes another year
Come on everyone, new millennium
Here it comes another year
Everyone, new millennium

Rough rider, no you don't want nada

Buffalo soldier, look it's like I told ya
Any damsel that's in distress
Be outta that dress when she meet Jim West
Rough neck so go check the law and abide
Watch your step or flex and get a hole in your side
Swallow your pride, don't let your lip react
You don't wanna see my hand where my hip be at
With Artemus, from the start of this, runnin' the game
James West, tamin' the West, so remember the name

[Pre-Chorus: Will Smith, Sisqo & Kool Moe Dee]

Lookin damn good though, if I could say it myself
Told me Loveless is a mad man, but I don't fear that

Tryin to bring down me, THE CHAMPION?
When y'all clowns gon' see that it CAN'T BE DONE
Understand me, son, I'm the slickest they is

Don't even think about it, six gun, weighin a ton
Ten paces and turn (one.. two.. three..) just for fun, son *BANG*
Up til sundown, rollin around

Don't mess with us, cause we in the

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
I'm Chill-Master-Nell of a thousand MC's
But how are you gonna tell the real rappers from these phonies?
'Cause these days, everyone wanna deal with a record company
They go home, they write a rhyme
They think they ready to battle Wyclef
Some write forward, some write backward
I wait for them to get jiggy then catch 'em in reverse, yo
With a verse that's worse than the last one
Some say BOOF! Even though you used to diss Jamaicans
And Haitians 'cause you thought I was American
Ay, Pras, remember that song they sang? (Yeah)
(Go back to Jamaica, what's good is what's new)
But now we Boof Baf the knuckles with the Tranzlator Crew laaaaa

[Verse 2: Pras]
I'm from the Island, the island I'm from is the Strong Island
MC's must be wacked when I syke from lack of freestylin'
Mind must be sharp until my holler girl, I get all in
Black stylin', wildin', Boof'll be trappin'
When they come to Battery Sound, see they shoes flappin'
Huh! Coolin' while I'm rappin'

[Refrain: Wyclef Jean]
(Boof Baf) Another son gonna die
(Boof Baf) If a boy just come try
(Boof Baf) Another son gonna die
(Boof Baf) If a boy just come try

[Verse 3: Wyclef Jean]
Said if you write with pencil, you must write with (Pen)
If you have a rooster, you must have a (Hen)
Five plus five, you know that equals to (Ten)
Then spite the yellow man, check it two, one-two, one, syke

[Verse 4: Pras]
(One, two) I throw a flow, go catch it
(Three, four) Back she throw before the track miss
(How far?) Can our style go to wreck this static?
(Will the sister grab the mic and do damage?)

[Verse 5: Lauryn Hill]
Aiyyo, I used to drive a hooptie, check me now, Snoopy
Rollin' With The Jones' but I prefer Home Alone
See, life's got no value if I ain't got no statue
Hannibal heads, I be the kid from Timbuktu
(One, two) Simply means, yo, check the mic, I'm ready!
(Three, four!) Means the armies of God with Uzi's
So, what came first, man? The chicken or the hoodie?
If the hoodie came first, then mans' name would be Nancy
So kill the Jesse James, rough, step back, check your stance
I'll let you feel me like the chi-chi-woo-woo-boogie-man
You say non-violence, but you're Silence of The Lambs
And when I call your name, I say Candyman, Candyman, Candyman
(Yes, I can, can, yes, I can, can)

[Refrain: Wyclef Jean]
(Boof Baf) Another son gonna die
(Boof Baf) If a boy just come try
(Boof Baf) Another son gonna die
(Boof Baf) If a boy just come try

[Bridge: Wyclef Jean]
Well, I'm on fire (Fire), fire (Fire), fire (Fire)
So let me re-light your Viacom
And let you enter the-the-elec-tronic (Coof)
And let you enter the-the-elec-tronic (Coof)
And let you enter the-the-elec-tronic (Coof)
And let you enter the-the-elec-tronic
All that movin', I call my nozzle you see I was an electronic
You listen to your lyrics in chime, your Panasonic
Ly-ly-ly-lyrical-UH, the di-di-di-digital
Pras, take the mic, man, you know you're really critical

[Verse 7: Pras]
Stall MC's soft, put 'em up for-ah Death Row (Yeah)
Rhyme and cultural, style and never old
Slap a priest fool, ooh, you're filth-swolled

[Verse 8: Wyclef Jean]
I say no to spliff, coolin' it
Somebody chuck me a– Coolin' it, coolin' it, coolin' it!
Somebody chuck me a– Hold the mic, hold the mic, hold the mic
I shoot 'em down with my last one, last one, last one, last one
(Boo-shoo-coo-coo, smoke)
I got my bullet-proof and now to send my bozack

[Refrain: Wyclef Jean]
(Boof Baf) Another son gonna die
(Boof Baf) If a boy just come try
(Boof Baf) Another son gonna die
(Boof Baf) If a boy just come try

[Verse 9: Wyclef Jean]
This rap goes for the brothers in the neighborhood
Who used to rap on a Polaroid; here comes Father Joe
Let me clock the block as I pull fo'-five
Boof Baf! I cut the block but got stopped
I used to play hookie just to see how good an MC was
He said I bust a battle; aight, I still took a gun
No cheeba, cheeba, just a Libra on a natural high
I waited so long to come out, I died and came back to life
So, hear the spirits, many fear us, a new style, son
This the new thing under the Sun, when I come, I come
Bam-bam, alakazam, he grabbed the pocket book, they ran
I came back with the bag 'cause that's my momma, man
I'm just patrollin', Boof Baf on the block
But the spot that I clock, you get shot if your numbers' are bad
So, don't get caught in the fast lane, the fast lane
And just remain yourself and be the same
'Cause many rappers these days say nuttin' for nuttin'
So, here's somethin', um, to take you from the AM to the PM

[Verse 10: Pras]
'Cause an imitator could never be greater
Than the creator whose the originator, step up perpetrator
See you later, alligator, back-stabbin' traitor
Tape recorder, duplicator
Roughly ridin' with the head Tranzlator, huh!
And leave the 40 to be naughty in the 'frigerator

[Refrain: Wyclef Jean]
(Boof Baf) Another son gonna die
(Boof Baf) If a boy just come try
(Boof Baf) Another son gonna die
(Boof Baf) If a boy just come try
(Boof Baf) Another son gonna die
(Boof Baf) If a boy just come try
(Boof Baf) Another son gonna die
(Boof Baf) If a boy just come try

[Outro: Wyclef Jean]
Say, gun-man (Boof Baf)
Say, tell me where you get your damn gun from? (Boof Baf)
You musta get it from the foreign land (Boof Baf)
We want to shoot up the whole of Babylon (Boof Baf)
Pay the man to rhyme onto it
Say, gun-man (Boof Baf)
Say, tell me where you get your damn gun from? (Boof Baf)
You musta get it from the foreign land (Boof Baf)
You want to kill your own brother, man (Boof Baf)
Ay, ay, ay (Boof Baf)

[Pras]
Aiyyo, somethin' funny, somethin' got you caught up in digs

You gonna need more than an iron to stretch out ya wrinkles
You startin' so ordinary, and me, map me out for sprinkler
You got the fever for the flavor for the giggles
Who got the giggles is the jam of December, hey

Back in grammar school days it's me the E's-M-T
Totally and directly, wonder, more than too fresh and nuttin' really else today
It was my accent and where I came from that ya really hate
The 'N' wear - Levi's, Pumas, struggle Adidas
Some say I'm with the losers cause I didn't have the ladies
No R-E-S-P-E-C-T as we can't get no punanny
Definitely hittin' them daily
Now I roll with the squad that's so hard and makes
You wanna catch an erection - relax man!!
I don't allow you to put-out actin' on if the one's direction
So it's Pete Prop, yo what's up man, hah
So if ya were thankful then I see cause the paper
Gettin' murderin' like the a-lovin' - now the news - Rodney King is
Now with the double list comin' through your speakers
Remember durin' steebers, why don't you get your speakers tweetered, whoo!!

[Chorus]
Who got the giggles?
You got the giggles, they got the giggles
Everybody got the giggles

You got the giggles, they got the giggles

[Pras]
Now ya wanna be down, you come around, touch gun of the town
You gotta dig my sound - Wow!!
It seems like everybody's jumpin' on the bandWAGON!!
Her money grabbin' a chick is a suburban dragon
I wasn't all of that - rappin' - but this is now
What's the matter? Ya milkin' like a freakin' cow
Cat guns yo' Tennessee, here kitty, kitty, kitty
Here pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy cat
You start to smell like one - all you really are was the head
I wanna give a shout-out to those who try and curse
My fave for 

[?] gat, you were funny though
Shall, shall, leave the play-down
These are the things we can do without, huh
So what's this all about man?
Just when I thought I was chillin' with my Lee's
And my fellas, seeds and my pro-kicks
My style was so deaf, "thuggin' won't even make it fresh" he said
So now I need my tracks that ?bite-neck? Fred
It's that ya mess with, it's just stitches that I thread
Loadin' the clip for-go-twenty-four-Karen-Lead
Her double-days, puttin' 'G' at her head - RAPOW!! You're dead

[Chorus]
Who got the giggles?
You got the giggles, they got the giggles
Everybody got the giggles
Who got the giggles?
You got the giggles, they got the giggles
Everybody got the giggles

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill]
Who got the giggles?
You got the giggles, they got the giggles
Everybody got the giggles
Who got the giggles?
You got the giggles, they got the giggles
Everybody got the giggles

[Pras]
You ever havin' the giggles to the HUH!!
The hiccups, the kinda hiccups that makes ya wanna come up
In your face and throw up, you're totally ?smuck?!!
You feelin' dirty and quitter, you neither or either a home or hitter
Much more like Peter but couldn't beat her pick
Caught in the middle with the rhythm, you're feelin'
Wish she trippin', you'll be livin' with the A-hahahahahaha......
The giggles

[Chorus]
Who got the giggles?
You got the giggles, they got the giggles
Everybody got the giggles

You got the giggles, they got the giggles

[Intro: DJ Jah Walton]
Lickwood means "rewind" and gunshot means "forward"
You requested it, so we rewind
(Come on)

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
Wait a second, draw back, ban this, here I come
Stick this business, stock me up, they took my coat with a stun gun
On a Sunday, a bloody Sunday, so what's the resume?
Heads got felt in the force, I heard a Milky Way
I caught a heart attack when I heard my cousin duck hunt
In Avenue D, in Brooklyn, New York City
Ever since I used my man, I moved to Jersey
But realistically, God could of called me early
'Cause I got a big bop, I'm wanted by the block
I take a ruff-neck chicken make stop in stone top
'Cause I roll with the army of sixty-eight
The Privates' don't make the orders, it's the General that makes the wig-wack
Buy her back, buy a cat, I got scratched in a day to kidnap
And at night, I was back and the Jeep, got attacked by a gang that sold crack
But the posse was strapped, it was nothin' but crap
I got cuffed in the back, in the jail there were rats
So I pulled out my mack to get out of this crap
Though I wish I could zap outta here, but I quack like a dog
That pass gas, so I put the gas mask on the mic
There were blasts, 'cause I do it, it's my task
And all the jumper the guys that I see to me pass the class
Check out the vocab, it don't got nothin' to do with the gift of gab
If you're good, you're good; if you're bad, you're bad

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
So how hard is it? (Hard as it can get)
I wanna know, how hard do you wanna it? (Hard as it can get)

[Verse 2: Pras]
One, two (One, Two)
Three, four (Three, four)
Hardcore (Hardcore)
Hardcore (Hardcore)
Yo, watch yourself for your health I'll snatch your last breath
Then, I left you up for another one bites the dust
You couldn't ride me if you went behind the bush, gush
Leave the style alone, don't try to follow me
'Cause a life of the hood make it a little triggery
So keep your eyes on the prize, don't be surprised
'Cause on my half I may pull out a semi-automatic sixty-eight
Watch around my back, it's mainly static
Droppin' emcees like a bad habit
Here come the Pras with a new package

[Verse 3: Wyclef Jean]
Mad and they ignorant, think they can test the performance of an ancient (Rapper)
Let me break it down in a dialect (Badder)
Easier said than what the mono said
'Cause there's more than righter rapper, paid for the rapper be-bop
'Cause he said everybody's rappin', them and they momma
So when I grab the mic, I grab it like a gangster
Microphone sniper, 'cause it'll be the prowler
Launch it, it's trife, no magic, the realistic maggot
Don't leave the gadget or you'll be gat it
Simple, the riddle, who's the monkey in the middle
What's the goose, um
So let me cut his neck loose, yo
I keep it positive and not so negative
These is when you diss, emcees take it
So send it to they call the battle
I'ma raw I let it rappin', now I'm more
Your ball, you're waitin' for me to fall, but I won't stop

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
So how hard is it? (Hard as it can get)
I wanna know, how hard do you wanna it? (Hard as it can get)

[Verse 4: Lauryn Hill & Wyclef Jean]
I gotta jump on the A-Train, I saw cat with a scat, he was blowin' like Coltrane
My boys said: "Give him a call", I gave him a dollar, he said: "Are you a rapper?"
Kids have a seat and don't miss a beat, and listen to the battle of the saxin' in your emcee
Now Red Rock, call Red Rock, call Red Rock, call Red Rock, call Red Rock call
(It could mean rewind the gun-check me, baby)
I rock and shock the dough is show squeeze and cheese and whether pleasin'
(It could mean rewind the gun-check me, baby)
I rock and shock the dough is show squeeze and cheese and whether pleasin'
Coolin' breezin' at the teas and how can emcees do was sneeze
(Flower blow!)

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
So how hard is it? (Hard as it can get)
I wanna know, how hard do you wanna it? (Hard as it can get)
So how hard is it? (Hard as it can get)
I wanna know, how hard do you wanna it? (Hard as it can get)
So how hard is it? (Hard as it can get)
I wanna know, how hard do you wanna it? (Hard as it can get)
So how hard is it? (Hard as it can get)
I wanna know, how hard do you wanna it? (Hard as it can get)
So how hard is it? (Hard as it can get)
I wanna know, how hard do you wanna it? (Hard as it can get)
So how hard is it?

[Hook: Wyclef Jean]
Yo Mona Lisa, could I get a date on Friday?
And if you're busy, I wouldn't mind taking
Saturday-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay
Round up de posse, Fugee comin' around the way

[Wyclef] Yo, hey nappy head

[Lauryn] Yo whashup?

[Wyclef] What you got there?

[Lauryn] Hah, I got some of that lyrical cheeba cheeba

[Wyclef] Worrrrrd?

A cheeba cheeba y'all, well I'm a Libra y'all
A cheeba cheeba y'all, well I'm a Libra y'all

[Verse 1: Wyclef]
You wanna battle? Swing
I bring commanding men like I was king
In all your dreams I write the horror flick of Stephen King
Cling to false also those papers say ock
I got tired of the fat lady so I sing to my own opera
Ba-lang-balang-balang-to-de-man-de-rock-cause I love thee
If you live by the sword you will be die by the gun
Cause all guys tell lies, and more girls commits sin
I was ordered to Code Red, but now I'm chillin' with A Few Good Men
Assassination on the kid from the capitol
I never play the soap opera but now I'm in General Hospital
Condition critical, spirit over who's the physical
So if I die, catch me at the funeral
I'll fly away, ohh glory
With a mic in my hand to a land where only God knows me
And the angels write raps on holy paper
I said I'm lookin for Jesus, he said "Take the escalator
One flight up, is guaranteed He'll be there"
My sister'd be there, my mother'd be there
So...

[Hook]
Yo Mona Lisa, could I get a date on Friday?
And if you're busy, I wouldn't mind taking
Saturday-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay
Round up de posse, Fugee comin' around the way

[Verse 2: Lauryn Hill]
I don't puff blunts so I always got my breath
Never had to battle with a bullet proof vest
They call me cock-weasel but I, still cave a chest
I don't wear Jheri curls cause I'm not from the West
No disrespect to the West, true indeed
I rock it to the East, the East is the seed
To see that them days back, yo sheepskins and Hot Tracks
Peace to Mr. Magic, things are getting tragic
Now we on some new stuff, I never feared the Ku Klux
My own clan is actin up, I blame it on the Phillie blunt
What you gonna do, kids are acting oooohhhh
Hill is gettin' badder, yo where's the corporate ladder?
Mr. Three Piece Suit
Check the square roots, Girbauds and Timberland boots
Nahhhh that's the serpents, and know them garment tips
I got a head full of problems and a hand full of nappy roots
I feel a Jones comin' down, yo I...

[Wyclef]
(I got the slang to make the chitty-bang-bang
A-rid-dang-de-dang, the nappy head bang)

[Lauryn]
No I, got the slang to make the chitty-bang-bang
A-rid-dang-de-dang, the nappy heads reign!

[Hook]
Yo Mona Lisa, could I get a date on Friday?
And if you're busy, I wouldn't mind taking
Saturday-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay
Round up de posse, Fugee comin' around the way
Nappy heads in the zone and we're not goin' home!

[Verse 3: Pras]
Hey yo a battle is a battle but a battle's not a battle
If it'sssssssssss snake doesn't rattle
Cause my style's as old as a reptile
As slick as a Nu Nile, as new as a new child
So come follow me to the land of Abraham
This land's your land, this land's my land
The blacker the black man, the better the next man

[Lauryn]
(Yo some nappy heads need to check they necks for red)

[Wyclef]
Ihhhh, feel injection
Put the needle to your skin feel reality's heroin
You maintain to put a negro in pain you used to diss me
"Oh you wanna hang with old Eddie Kane?"
Ain't nuttin wrong, snap your head to the song
Word is bond, you get wrong
I'll have you sing like Louis Armstrong
And I say to myself, what a wonderful world
But what the hell was so wonderful 'bout cotton in the farm
Mr. Slaaaaaave Maaaaan!
The harder they come, the harder they fall, so come one come all
Don't stall or I'mma stick you like a voodoo doll
Doors locked stop drawer for the count who drops
You slept on a kid from the boondocks
Out of Hootaville, land of the ill kill
Vailsburgh Viking so you know I'm top ranking Phil
Some say who coming like like the yuma but save the rumor
Cause I've been rockin ever since eighty-two
When I used to rock my Pumas...
A cheeba cheeba y'all, well I'm a Libra y'all
A cheeba cheeba y'all, well I'm a Libra y'all
A cheeba cheeba y'all, well I'm a Libra y'all
A cheeba cheeba y'all, well I'm a Libra y'all

[Hook]
Yo Mona Lisa, could I get a date on Friday?
And if you're busy, I wouldn't mind taking
Saturday-ay-ay, ay-ay-ay
Round up de posse, Fugee comin' around the way
Nappy heads in the zone and we're not goin home!

[Outro X2]
I wear my sunglasses at night
To spy on my girlfriend that's right
They dancing, romancing, freaking at night!
Yes yes yes a yes yes y'all

[Hook: Wyclef]
Why am I trapped in a cage?
(THE NAPPY HEADS ARE COMIN OUT)
Barber can I get a fade?
(THE NAPPY HEADS ARE COMIN OUT)
Teacher teacher check my grades
(THE NAPPY HEADS ARE COMIN OUT)
I grab the mic in a RAGE...

[Verse 1: Wyclef]
You maintain to put a negro in pain you used to diss me
"You sure you wanna hang with old Eddie Kane?"
Ain't nuttin wrong, so snap your head to the song
Word is bond, you get wrong, I'll have you sing like Louis Armstrong
''And I say to myself, what a wonderful world''
But what the fuck was so wonderful
Bout picking cotton -- on a farm?!
The harder they come, the harder they fall
So come one come all
Don't stall or I'mma stick you like a voodoo doll
Doors locked stop draw for the count, who drops?
Ten-nine-eight-seven-six-five-four-three-two-one-
-you-slept-on-a-kid-from-the-boondocks
Out of Hooterville land of the ill kill
Bellsburg Viking so you know I'm top ranking Phil
Some say newcomer like the yuma but save the rumor
Cause I've been rockin ever since eighty-three
When I used to rock my Pumas
Rap, narcotic psychotic, so hear the statistic
One out of ten, I'm passin the mic next time I'll get WICKED
Heard the man who went before, got intimated
You tried to gas me up, too much gas, you got intoxicated
You wasn't ready for the real'n, dealin, chillin
Wyclef, no competition when I'm bringin pure death
I'm jumpin like a monkey to get mines off
A-from a caterpillar, to the mic moth

[Hook]
(THE NAPPY HEADS ARE COMIN OUT)
Teacher teacher check my grades
(THE NAPPY HEADS ARE COMIN OUT)
I coulda sworn I had an A
(THE NAPPY HEADS ARE COMIN OUT)
I grab the mic in a RAGE...

[Pras]
You put, one and one together now you think you a rapper
Baseball cap backward, forearms swingin like a hip-hopper
You do the rhyme, thinkin no one can stop ya
I be the followin that chop ya down as I clock ya, hah
When I say five-oh, I mean fifty not guns or cops
Now here's the heavyweight knocker, the freedom fighter
Natural rhythm rock a mic I always rhyme I'm never drinkin vodka
Any old style, I throw it in a locker

[Lauryn Hill]
Well I'm a Gucci rocker, I never drank no vodka
Me got no bag of cheeba cause I never had a knocker
My cousin's name was Shaka, for short we called him 'Aka
I flip it on wack MC's because to me they flow like caca

[Pras]
You boogie move the groove, nothing to prove you lose
Your style remind of yesterday, old news
Sad sung blues who's, chose the one to feel the pain
Or bring the cane, tick-tock I come to pick your lock
It's not for capital gain
So watch out for the remain, or cry from bloodstain
Bustin nuts, bustin style
Gettin buckwild some think I'm the descendant of a wilder child
Comin on the mic, from a higher level
Broke is no joke, choke the hell out of the devil

[Hook]
(THE NAPPY HEADS ARE COMIN OUT)
What about Martin?
(THE NAPPY HEADS ARE COMIN OUT)
What about Malcolm?
(THE NAPPY HEADS ARE COMIN OUT)
Rosa Parks?
(THE NAPPY HEADS ARE COMIN OUT)
You hung a man after dark
(THE NAPPY HEADS ARE COMIN OUT)
Cease the violence!
(THE NAPPY HEADS ARE COMIN OUT)

[Wyclef]
Yo who got the power, to make a man raise from the dead?
Some said that it was Jesus, they said he was a notty dread
But I don't mean to confuse a world that's confused
Mind's atomic, so like a bomb, let me drop it
Can't get too deep, cause some sleep while I wake
In a dream that's made of wine but let me bring it back to grapes
Teacher, explain the parable, it's simple:
It's easier for the camel to go through the eye of a needle
Than for you to enter the kingdom, or battle
And walk away, with the title when I get, brutal
Feelings are mutual so sign your life, to Prudential
Don't even flinch, the other becomin spiritual
There's six million ways to die but choose four
Cause I can still be in the desert buttnaked and be HARDCORE!

[Lauryn Hill]
When 

[?] checks that means pump your fist
Remember Moses people, this is Exodus
Don't try to stop this, the force comes from Genesis
Them who did us wrong, ask the Lord for forgiveness
The land that I’m from ain’t the land of the dumb
We droppin the bass drum, then we 

[?]
You can’t kill the battle with a horn, blam blam, Silly Joshua
So march to St. Lawrence
Yo march I got your back, march!

[Wyclef]
Crown Heights (THE NAPPY HEADS ARE COMIN OUT)
Cease the violence (THE NAPPY HEADS ARE COMIN OUT)
A moment of silence (THE NAPPY HEADS ARE COMIN OUT)
For those who died (THE NAPPY HEADS ARE COMIN OUT)
Public Enemy (THE NAPPY HEADS ARE COMIN OUT)
Number one (THE NAPPY HEADS ARE COMIN OUT)
Fredric Douglass (THE NAPPY HEADS ARE COMIN OUT)
Harriet Tubman (THE NAPPY HEADS ARE COMIN OUT)
Aristide (THE NAPPY HEADS ARE COMIN OUT)
Bob Marley (THE NAPPY HEADS ARE COMIN OUT)
Prazwell (THE NAPPY HEADS ARE COMIN OUT)
To my man Khalid (THE NAPPY HEADS ARE COMIN OUT)

[Lauryn Hill]
Now, speak of resistance, we're nappy heads
Rhymes, kinks, braids and dreads
The mother of creation, epitome of creativity, yeah
And keep your heads nappy

[Wyclef Jean - responding to an overlord voice]
THE YEAR
Two-thousand and seventeen master!
THE MAN
Every two-thousand years a prophecy is prophesized
THE MISSION
To carry out the word of the shephard into this cold world
That just keeps folding
THE GROUP
I don't know...
WHO IS THE GROUP
Tran...Tranzlators!!

[Lauryn Hill]
What can make a mighty man run?
Make him drop his pride and hide?
Too black, too strong... WRONG
Spook, Sambo, Nigga, Jig
You ain't so bad, nor big
White sheets make you sad
Fraid you're gonna hang, ahhh
Now THAT'S a black thang
Boy, you scared of me
BOO! See
Hide nigga hide, flee nigga flee run nigga run
If I got my hood, my cross, my tree my gun
My rope
And it's a long one

[Intro]
(*inhales, then coughs*)
Ay, nigga pass me the blunt
(Go get the fuck outta here, oh shit)
(*inhales and coughing continues*)
Ay, pass this over here man, so we can just cipher youknowwhaI'msayin'?
Cip, yo, this is for dolo son (*inhales*)
Yo, man, c'mon pass the blunt man (Yo champ, champ, champ)
Yo, pass the blunt man (hold it man)
Whassup man? (Yo, hold it up, aight, take the fuckin' blunt)
Yeah, whassup? (Damn) (*inhales continue*)
I ain't even get charged yet
(C'mon man, let's cip man about the good ol' days man youknowwhaI'msayin'?) (yeah)
See man, white man tryin' to keep this away from us man youknowI'msayin'? (Uh-hmm)
Cause they know when you grab this man
You just be ciphin' knowledge man, knowledge as we buildin' up man
That's why they want no brothers to be out here man, youknowwhaI'msayin'?
That's why they try to make it illegal man (...you far, you far from reality...)
Yo, check this out man, this is, a natural herb man youknowI'msayin'?
It makes your body just and your mind just go to another...
(Yo, but hold - money you is talkin' too, much)
Yo, yo, yo man, yo we just ciphin' man (...talkin' that, pass the motherfuckin' blunt)
I know you Latin shit, burn the fuck out (I hate when motherfuckers do that shit)...

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
Y'all know there's a lot of MC's but just give my CHANCE ON THE MIC!!
Open the, open the, open the, open the, open the, open the
AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!
Open the safe with no key, it's easier than battlin' me
Cause uh-uh, I'll make you walk like a doggy
Some say on and on, but they mean ON-ON!!
I got tired of that new style - BREAKDOWN!!
I have to take it back to the break of dawn
When Melle Mel was Melle Mel and Al Capone was Al Capone
Bootleg is sellin' now it's rap that's sellin' in the village
But I'm just privileged to makin' my home from my spirit
So when you hear me it's the man with the deeper thoughts
At night I can't sleep my brain keep movin' like a body on a horse
I don't stand, don't stand, don't wife me I construct on bricks
Some thoughts it wasn't until he said: "He sunk my battleship"
So hip-hip, load the clip, hip, I miss - DAMN!!
I pay my taxes so I won't mess with Sam
Ya hear the rhyme you stand still, some ask for refill
We move your thoughts so I can see if you for fake or real
Cause Buffalo Bill bit battle inside from my rap meal
And left me on a hill-hill, so when I battle no will
So mama should I kill a man like Cypress Hill, chill
I got no lawyer so I pleadin' my own appeal
How does it feel - when a monkey is your ill
In a J-A-I-L? I have no time to make bail
Saw someone to be macho like bitches that got the lyro
So they had it at bein' a heroes, where did their bodies go, only God knows
You got caught, between the fire and the hoses
You wanna battle? Bring your Moses
Forget what fun-what time Moses
And someone goin' down and it ain't Buster Douglass
Cause the roughest with the gun, becomes a pussy
So all the bad boy talk, come on cause I'm the nice dog, yeah hawk
Throw many fights in fought courts boss
Never lost, so toss a nickel and change your course
Say mama say mama say mama say what?

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean and Lauryn Hill]
Some thought we were blunted when we wrote this
Cause we were far, from reality
Some thought we were blunted when we wrote this
Cause we were far, from reality

[Verse 2: Lauryn Hill]
Aiyyo, ho-ho-ho with the bottle of rum and tip
Who walks really for lack of listenin' to the drum-set
You silly bimbo tried to steal my cargo put the peso
Oh on the table tess supernatural
You got caught all that toe with twenty-thousand leagues
I'm laughin' arrogantly as your nostril bleeds hehehehehe...
Relax and max and drink a Gin on the deck
While navigatin' for another pirate to lose his neck, check
I got a call from Captain Hook, MC Cook
We used to be partners 'fore the crook stole my rhyme book
I had to rewrite cause you bite like you was a bitch
I had to change the rhythmic pattern and make sure it fit
So now when I go and see with she
I thought the pirates through a telescope
And bomb 'em like it's make-believe
Throw me my sword I out for my protection
Cause on my ship one man he tried to start an insurrection
A pirate had disguised himself as one of my crew
But I start shooting and had him shaking before he got through
Hey, he tried to loot the booty of all my good rhymes
I gave an ultimatum and told him he could do time
But he argued and fought me, he tried to bust right
And so I took it upon myself to make the brother walk the plank

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean & Lauryn Hill]
Some thought we were blunted when we wrote this
Cause we were far, from reality
Some thought we were blunted when we wrote this
Cause we were far, from reality

[Verse 3: Pras]
Fo'-to-the-fo'-to-the-fi-fe-come
I smell the blood of an Englishman run son
Ya see the man cannot understand
The hammer and the barrel hum
So when I get them someone will know where the hell I'm from
Cause I'm sprayin' emcees with my mack ten machine gun
The hand that rocks will be the hand of the gun bum
Rum-pum-pum-pum-pum is the drop of my snare drum
Freak-k-k-k-kin' is the beat of my tum-tum
Makin' emcees walk like a doggy, hah-hah, I'll make them walk like a doggy
It's like the blunt to the phillie, the ganja to the sessy
You can't write a rhyme without the roots men-mentality
Cause ain't no Milli Vanilli but the kiddy with the skilly
To rhyme so dope I made up my own vocabulab-skilly
Missed it from a bomber-tacky lackin' all the bum
That get her to a to and fro, I guess they made me boy
So can I get the cheers, not the chant from cheers
But the chant from my peers that I know are really down with me (CHEERS!!)
Now that I mean those that been since the beginnin'
(cause some of y'all cut out when it started rainin')
Now check me at the movies I'm rollin' like Black Man
I didn't need Batman, he teamed up with the favourite - EH!!
Tell all your friend-friend, watch all your friend-friend
Cause some say are your friend before wanna dem bring you poison
So I roll by myself and that I carry my (BIT!!)
You wished you stayed around, you know my clip got the (LIP!!)
So empty your hooray, your hooray to your hip
And if your hip's a book you know you got to get off bricks man

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean & Lauryn Hill]
Some thought we were blunted when we wrote this
Cause we were far, from reality
Some thought we were blunted when we wrote this
Cause we were far, from reality
Some thought we were blunted when we wrote this
Cause we were far, from reality
Some thought we were blunted when we wrote this
Cause we were far, from reality
Some thought we were blunted when we wrote this
Cause we were far, from reality
Some thought we were blunted when we wrote this
Cause we were far, from reality

[Intro]
And when you feelin down, recharge

[Wyclef]
Now and, forevers, them emperors, are nova
The lovin, the huggin, will never be over

[Pras]
Back up back up boy, don't get me started
Still the MC, hit the target, you get bombarded yeah
Affect the minds, let the blind evaporate
Let me elaborate, ohhhhh nooooooo (it's too late)
Push the button, cause I'mma get ??
Pass me a SCUD missle, so I can bomb the land

[Wyclef]
Yo Pras (what?)  Yo Pras (what?)  Some start to wonder
Some see lightning, some hear THUNDER
Shades of a black man, maybe the black panther
Makin MC's run when it come to rappin I'm the Darth Vader
I'm not regular, consider me ir-regular
From the regular rapper ones that lumber
But I come from a slum where many bum
Sometimes I cooled out, while my boys were in prison
I always told them that right, overrules wrong
Cause ever since a boy mama told me judgment they will come son
So I watch what I do, what I say, how I PLAY
And hope that I make it through the next day
Cause the streets are like a jungle, they got me say
OH-AY-OH-AY-OH, cause Tarzan's a black man
So I'm waiting for a break in the record company
So I could take you MC's, back to camp I mean
Cause with a flick of my wrist, I come rewind another RHYME
I got more rhymes than a church got WINES
Ever since middle school, I used to, rule
The kick of a mule, people called my talent beautiful
Never lost a battle, they thought I was buckWILD
Beat 'em by a dozen, I ship them to MosCOW
They didn't know that a ReFugee could rock so well
So here's the resurrection, of Pras, Wyclef, and L
Check me or my team as I recharge your body
Check me or my team as I recharge your body
Check me or my team as I recharge your body
Check me or my team as I recharge your body

[Pras]
Livin to be given, chillin like Bob Dylan
Like Michael I'm Thrillin, I'm not dealin to be illin
Runnin a massacre, like the task force
The cause is laws, the laws that broke your jaw
Now I'm, gettin raw on a thing like a mean machine
(Why you runnin around with the same old thing?
Humm.. you know what I mean, yeah)
I search and search, I start to faint
But never never never fall in entertain
Don't beam me up Scotty, I'm audi like John Gotti
Drivin in black Caddy

[Lauryn Hill]
Success for the next man is success for myself
Vanity's vanity yet I still wanted wealth
I know there's a true God, but it still makes me think
Of Yusef.. now is the notty dread dead?
Believe in the Bible because it promise eternity
666, that makes you, my adversary
So I, watch my back and hopin I don't get taxed
I used to, rip the rapper cause they said we'd been said wack
I know what the critics they say, keep it commercial
I used to freestyle, but everything now is rehearsal
I miss the old school, so tell me what will I do?
I guess I'll start a revolution with the Tranzlator Crew, so..

[Wyclef]
Check me or my team as I recharge your body
Check me or my team as I recharge your body
Check me or my team as I recharge your body
Check me or my team as I recharge your body

[Wyclef]
They label me (WHAT?) the MC psycho
Prim' you up, but don't mistake me for Sunoco
Cuss to get loose, now you got the micro' Joe
Who talkin about hope?  Poquito dinero
Means I work hard, but got no money, and that ain't funny
Hey honey when you work for free see it's hard to get a lady baby
But they say good things come to those wait
So I wait, no ego trip, and on the mic I penetrate
Elevate as I battle for high stakes
Many gamble, I eat you like an ANIMAL
Cause he gambled for the dime that he didn't have
He woke up in a dream and found his body in a body bag
Wyclef pissed cause, oh what I really said is
Is I'm that funky, big up def in pig latin man, hah
A lot of rappers try to outrap, but miss me yo
But I'm askin every teachers everything he know
There's always one trick, to make em slip
So let me predict in pure trick I'm sure the rap form will recharge

Me lick me one, me lick me one one

John 3:16
For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have ever lasting life
Lord have mercy!
Yo', check it out, I want all the refugees out there to just put up your motherfuckin' hands, you know you're a fuckin' immigrant
Put up your hands youknowhatI'msayin'?
I'ma start this shit off like this, this time around

[Hook: Wyclef Jean]
H-to-the-A-to-the-I-to-the-T-to-the-I -Live or die, it's nothin' but a dark side
Fugees on the mic, yeah, yeah, yo', refugees on the mic, oh yeah, oh yeah
H-to-the-A-to-the-I-to-the-T-to-the-I -Live or die, it's nothin' but a dark side
Fugees on the mic, yeah, yeah, yo', refugees on the mic, oh yeah, oh yeah

[Wyclef Jean]
If you wanna snap (SNAP), if you wanna crack (CRACK)
If you wanna shoot, give me a second so I can lay flat
Cause this, some the cemetary's, the reality
Where the tough guys get buried in their property
Word to Sampson, the tone will get you hung
I had a friend, they murdered his father and his three-year-old son
I heard him cursin' the essence of the, the (PAUSE) committed the crime
But ah, murder got no time
The country has no law, it's either rich or poor
I'm out the back door, I got nuttin' to fight for
I'm sailin' on a boat like a goat - I clear my throat
When I got to Brooklyn, I was broke, so I selled coke
I look in through microscope, for my country and the hurt
My eyes bleed, I see Aristide, the Haitian Pope
Figure of Gandhi, courage of Malcolm X
Swing like the ki's, so should I put on David Tomerfest
Though I'm humberlicious strugglin' to jump
Let me blow her upper-her bubble in your face - that'cha ego!
Aiyyo, freeze-funk, you got to stay stable
Watch out for the devil, he comes after you after the revival
When will he come, what will he do, what will he say?
That's all a mystery, but have your hand grenade
So you can blow the motherfucker away
Beep, beep, I gotta make a sale so I can eat
So Praswell, grab the mic and be complete

[Pras]
Huh, lovin' the wreck in effect, will be all in checkmate
Another style for Praswell to translate
For those who can't relate to stay down my - no-man wait
No mistake, when I tell you, your prophet is a fake

[Wyclef Jean]
You said a contract on a Haitian, three-hundred g's
Your sharpshooters are lousy, real men don't hide behind hoodies
So show your face-a when you waste, I know who's smokin'
The bigger that you try to put out yours just makes me Mr. Nobody
Take high wit'cha just right, it'll be like Michael get ordered, a viper you know!!
Yeah, a viper cause you might lose a life to the side by like
What did I have to in the line of the barkin' of the bright side
You tried to scare me but I won't mover-a
The bully of the block becomes the hour of the Glock
So cuckoo!! The sounds I run are rollin' with the bodyguard
But don't forget the day it's sunny but it'll be foggy
And in the funeral, you'll be singin' a new tune
May your soul rest on the moon (?Jack in wood spoon!!?)
In Channel Seven, you said: "Death before Cut"
You killed so many that your conscience ended up - whattup? (WHAT!!)
Aiyyo black men, you're dyin' by a dozen cousin
So all I do is walk away yo' Prince as if nothin' happened
You call me a punk, I gotta step cause all you did was flex
But don't get closer cause the kid still gotta keep his rep
See I'm known for the crew like the jewel was the jewel
Like the follow got the boo, like the miller got the boo
Let the fool cop the man-jewel, suck up, up the ?cool-lew?
Oh why you got the ha-ha-lew-lew?
I got the rap loose, so sci-bi-dee-bob-bob, you don't stop
You do the rap-rap, from hip-hop to be-bop, from be-bop
To beep-beep, the Haitian kid, beeper's goin' off beep-beep
I gotta make a sale so I can eat, beep, beep
The Haitian kid, beeper's goin' off, you know I got no time to sleep, so beep-beep

[Hook]
H-to-the-A-to-the-I-to-the-T-to-the-I -Live or die, it's nothin' but a dark side
Fugees on the mic, yeah, yeah, yo', refugees on the mic, oh yeah, oh yeah
H-to-the-A-to-the-I-to-the-T-to-the-I -Live or die, it's nothin' but a dark side
Fugees on the mic, yeah, yeah, yo', refugees on the mic, oh yeah, oh yeah

[Pras]
Man, I went to court the other day to plead for my innocence
They brought me in under charges of illegal residence
An Alien, in a foreign land, Uncle Sam
Watch me go back to my land, the land of thing
Gorillas in the mist, where everything, and the light becomes a priest
They put up they guard, they pump up they fists
Now I'm number one on they motherfuckin' hit-list...
Goin' down for first degree of manslaughter
Makin' change out of emcee's makin' them outta quarters
That's they value, that's what they worth
Cause the first shall be last and the last shall be first, yeah
What we learned was to burn, now cause you c-came
With that machette, it's your turn
It's not funny, but twenty a month is what you earn baby
(We in to the Yankee, pass the mic to the "Yankee")

[Lauryn Hill]
Well I'm as cool to ya the mic I'm checkin' comin' from my temple
With a message, to deliver, but the back is very simple
I'm the girl "Yankee" rollin' wit' the kids from Haiti
Coolin' at the Mardis Gras who gets the last laugh hahaha...
You bite size with my Haitian from they stinks as my "Yankee"
Winderin' who was the first to pull over girl as soon as it came out son
My history - a hypocrite, so what we gonna do?
The dope is dope is only get the man since that is true
So I hip-hip with my lip as I rip with a felt tip
For the righteous situation, interpretation of degradation
You race relation and education, segregation, emancipation
Capitalization, inteagration not separation. Yo free the Haitians...
H-to-the-A-to-the-I-to-the-T-to-the-I...

[Intro: Wyclef Jean]
Yo check it out. This is the boy Wyclef from Tranzlators, I'm coming from the
Booga Basement with a roots drink in my hands.  So put the Roots tonics in the
Air, yeah cause I'm-a start this one off like THIS!
Cause niggas are living like there ain't no tomorrow. I nuked this on the S900 cause I couldn't afford A 1100
I'm-a start this one a little something like this, here we go

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
Hey yo people you're living like there ain't no tomorrow
You get caught in the terror of Sodom and Gamorrah
Father, forgeive him for he know not what he done
When the bum search for crumbs, the son search for condoms
He seek no, with his ring but with his head
That leave many dead in hospital beds; now you and death are newlyweds
So before I enter the tunnel I step back and shake it
Is it world the death or better life in a casket
Destuction of the flesh, new reporter wasn't coming
The devil cursed him cause he couldn't follow 10 commandments

[Hook]
Living like there ain't no tomorrow
You're living like there ain't no tomorrow
You're living like there ain't no tomorrow
You open up your eyes and it was Sodom & Gamorrah—WOO!
Living like there ain't no tomorrow
You're living like there ain't no tomorrow
You're living like there ain't no tomorrow
Open up your eyes

[Verse 2: Wyclef Jean]
I called up the VP, she told me she was busy watching TV with Roxy
I told her I was coming, she said that ain't necessary
Three's a crowd, so what's the philosophy?
Another girl trying to take my girl away from me, easy
Fuck the door, I jumped through the window
SOMEWHERE over the rainbow
Geromimo! Ain’t no bitch stealin' my ho
Stick stick in your socket, I sacrifice you like a live rabbit
Fatal attraction the coffin's the cabinet
Cause in the 90's girls got dicks
So keep the light on, and make sure that the chicks don’t got the dicks
She said that she did it with some girl named Lisa
I said what's the boot yo, she pulled the camcorder
Bust it, so what's the charge, you called me a womanizor?
I tried to say sorrym she said say sorry for Taquisha
Chairs come flying my way like balls at basketball practice
Call the priest cause she's turning to the exorcist
She kicked me out cause she was paying for the apartment
That's real, you got no girl, if you got no money to spend
But she had loved me for my mind and my poetic skills
But now I'm checking magazings and getting cheap thrills
Asking myself when will it end?
Cause when it came to sex, my hand was my best friends

[Hook]
I'm living like there ain't no tomorrow
I'm living like there ain't no tomorrow
I'm living like there ain't no tomorrow
Open up my eyes and it was Sodom & Gamorrah—WOO!
Living like there ain't no tomorrow
I'm living like there ain't no tomorrow
I'm living like there ain't no tomorrow
Open up my eyes

[Verse 3: Wyclef Jean]
I had a cousin like a brother
He tried to play me undercover
He said I didn't bang her, but the girl was his secret lover
But I played stupid like my brain had no minerals
It's so hard to say good-bye we singing at the funeral
Girls smash it up easy, when they know they got the bugsy
He used to sleep alone, but now he's riding Mrs. Daisy
You say all my business my life's my life my knife's my knife
So I be the lion that guards the trife
But at the party, I still move my waistline
A girl approached me and asked me for the time
I said; no disrespect, but check the watch on your wrist
And if you're looking for a hit check Charles Bronson from Death Wish
Then All of a sudden her man pushed me from the back
I turned out real cool- I said why did you do that?
The name is Clef, Clef Bond
Then mark my word that I'm-a break your fucking arm
Unless you apologize and pick on someone your size
Not too cookoo-hit you-but the 4 to the 5
Point it to your nose
Now your blood turns to snow

[Hook]
I'm living like there ain't no tomorrow
I'm living like there ain't no tomorrow
I'm living like there ain't no tomorrow
Open up my eyes and it was Sodom & Gamorrah—WOO!
Living like there ain't no tomorrow
I'm living like there ain't no tomorrow
I'm living like there ain't no tomorrow
Open up my eyes

[Verse 1: Lauryn Hill]
Ah, check the crippled man sittin' in the church
My conscience hurts, flesh like me hits the dirt
She's paralyzed from her feet to her thighs
And the man who pulled the trigger didn't even lose his left eye
I check Jimmy cuttin' hair at the barbershop
He plays the bass guitar like David plays the harp
His knowledge name is Greek 'cause whenever he speaks
He's got the wisdom of King Solomon, bags in his eyes from no sleep
Sometimes he thought of the fame in Madison Square Garden
So some seek stardom, but they forget Harlem
But "Seek ye, first of all the kingdom of God," that's what my pops told me
So if I fall, could the choir catch me?
I flew away, on a mountain, got tempted by Satan
Got bitten by a cobra, but the Lord took my venom
So who's side am I on? I'm on the righteous
Always check the lyrics, no time to contradict

[Chorus]
Some seek stardom, then they forget Harlem
Some seek stardom, then they forget Harlem
Some seek stardom, then they forget Harlem
They keep their pockets full, but their souls run empty

[Verse 2: Lauryn Hill]
Well, ayo, family, I beseech you in the hopes that I may reach you
My mother taught me one day that Judgment Day would come someday
Born a dark Black child with kinky hair, grown wise
And teachers disliked me 'cause I knew where my culture be
So now, yeah, my brief history, I can't neglect my passion, see
Rocking's kind of new to me 'cause my true love was poetry
White was good and bad was black but black was just a massa lackey
Built for that B. Nimble Jack and I'd like to save you from the wicked
D-Dog clear I wouldn't be wet; The black to mourn, tomorrow's death
The evil things, glad that I, while angels wrote this violence, why?
Help me make me comprehend my black bezerk and why cast it
Time to blaze the angels nappy heads are braided that you make me
See what's wrong with me that don't make you flee when I enter your vicinity
You see my God ain't never asked of me
So, yo, I be wised up with Greek to go and be
But, alas, I clearly see what's wrong with me
It be your insecurity of me and my ability
So, prithee, won't you let me be or has thou asked too much from thy
To tell the truth and not to lie? Oh my

[Chorus]
Some seek stardom, then they forget Harlem
Some seek stardom, then they forget Harlem
Some seek stardom, then they forget Harlem
Brothers keep their pockets full, but their souls run empty
Some seek stardom, then they forget Harlem
Some seek stardom, then they forget Harlem
Some seek stardom, then they forget Harlem
Sisters keep their pockets full, but their souls run empty

[Verse 3: Lauryn Hill]
But as I grew, I knew 'cause the master told me
From a baby to a woman, from a woman to a baby
Life is so short, hardcore becomes hard-corpse
Stiff in a coffin where the money's no longer the source
There we go, there we go, there we go
I got mine, now won't you get yours? We never open doors
So we neglect, and don't protect the ones that's left
People never really seem to care
And then they cry out, "My people! Why aren't we treated equal?"
As we flee, we flee our own communities
We leave our family in poverty
And then we blame it on another, so, family, please recover
Oh c'mon, please, you can come with me now and blow it now
If you want to, we're through

[Chorus]
Some seek stardom, then they forget Harlem
Some seek stardom, then they forget Harlem
Some seek stardom, then they forget Harlem
Families keep their pockets full, but their souls run empty
Some seek stardom, then they forget Harlem
Some seek stardom, then they forget Harlem
Some seek stardom, then they forget Harlem
People keep their pockets full, but their souls run empty
Some seek stardom, then they forget Harlem
Some seek stardom, then they forget Harlem
Some seek stardom, then they forget Harlem
We keep our pockets full, but our souls run empty
Some seek stardom, then they forget Harlem
Some seek stardom, then they forget Harlem
Some seek stardom, then they forget Harlem
Brothers keep their pockets full, but their souls run empty

[Outro]
Some seek stardom, then they forget Harlem
Some seek stardom, then they forget Harlem

Yo! Now that I escape, selling five million plates
My beeper vibrates, like California earthquakes
But I keep a balanced head, cause you're hot, they're not
M.C.'s go Hollywood, then lose their spot on the jukebox
Still ichi bong, wack M.C.'s get the gong!
Lyrical tongue, wireless mics from Samsung
Wyclef, seduced once by an actress
Angela Basset wanted the head of Jean Baptiste
Meanwhile across town, I steal no money to Carlito
Mama always said don't gamble; I'm trapped in casino
No more money in my bags -Nightmares, getting closer
I slept on Elm Street, Freddy Kruger woke up with a German Luger
Black serial killer, man turns to gorilla
Provoked I change faces like Michael Jackson's Thriller
B-B-B-B-B-Boo! (Imitating young Michael Jackson)
And you don't stop!!!

[Hook 2: Lauryn Hill]
Sometimes the Refugees gotta take a stand and break!
If any joker come fe' test another life we take!
Cause when we gunning all the dance, we are the specialist!
So scientist, lyricist, pop your pen intense (?)! ( 2x )

[Verse Two: Lauryn Hill]
If I could change the times, and make rhymes, raise the babies
Give all the pigs rabies
Send biting niggas to Haiti's
Clothe young ladies
Chase the rainbow, find the pot
Free the third time offender once he learns to make salaat
Lose the fame
Take the money
Play boys, just like the bunny
Find a man with a plan
Slap a chicken, If she acts funny
Break the bank, on tank
Stop niggas from acting stank
Take over your bounty rovers
Teach a man to find Jehovah
Own the tours, own the stores
Watch the record, pimps and whores
Make love, stop the wars
Cop the land, like the Moors
Make the last be the first
Make the God respect the Earth
Change the murder rate to the birth! Bust it!

[Lauryn Hill:]
Ready Or Not! Here I come! You can't hide!
Gonna find you! And take it slowly!
Ready Or Not! Here I come! You can't hide!
Gonna find you! And make you want me!

[Verse Three: Pras]
No more tours, no more scores
Por favor senor, I tempt crews, like a bull to a matador
Run you for your Range Rover, Like that!
Leave you in a broken Nova, Like that!!
Buffalo soldier! Dreadlock rasta! (Wyclef in background)
Rather be slaughtered, than be captured!
Three refugees, one unusual suspect
A snitch at the table, how far will your trust get?
Lust got you busted, unlocking my vault
Body as a Q-Tip, right on the asphalt
Tell the youth that you shouldn't skylark
Or get marked, like a narc, as The Beast in Nu Yok (New York)

[Hook 1]

[Hook 2]

(Ready or not)

[Intro/Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
Delivered straight from the temple
Hip-hop ya don't stop
One o' clock, two o' clock, three o' clock, ROCK!!

[Lauryn Hill]
Well as an infant I was born into religion
My mother called me Baptist but what she forgot to mention
Was just what baptist meant! The story goes: God sent
His only begotten son who gave his life
To make sure that I would have one
As I learned in Sunday School, is God took care
Of who's ready to disrespect, my mother and father would be Taboo
But as I grew, I met a Jew, a Catholic
And a Protestant just couldn't figure out where Baptist fit
Hastily I pray thee that ya make me see
Why thou has confronted me with such ambiguity
Are you Jehovah? Or Buddha? Or shall I call ya Allah?
All due respect, Heavenly Father
I just like to be a scholar on the subject called theology
So that time I figure
While they call themselves Christians, ya still call me nigga
And off to store a black hole leaves no control over thought
I leave my body to see the pits
Go high when the physical takes control
No communications with the inner self
The prize is the up the wise, wise who has a spiritual health
Now to explain they had the problems/visions of gettin' along with herself
She bought a corner, cornered herself and becomes a mourner
Logic brothers...
(Ahhh, yo sister can Praswell and Wyclef get some, check it out)

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
Delivered straight from the temple
Hip-hop ya don't stop
One o' clock, two o' clock, three o' clock, ROCK!!

[Wyclef Jean]
Delivered straight from the (TEMPLE), I had no time to (SAMPLE)
My cousin's name was (SAMUEL), I wasn't allowed to use the turntables
My dad was a preacher, so rap music was pure devilism;
And if it wasn't sayin', "Thank You Lord!", I couldn't listen
So I used to sneak to listen to DJ Red Alert
To check the competition, or DJ Red Alert goes berserk!
Cause as a young lad, I had a big rap pad
Cause he who wanted to practice would someday be the greatest guy
So I checked them as they flippin' sometimes
They're not flippin', they think they rippin'-rappin'
The only rappin' they doin' is in they room before they packin'

[Pras]
You gained the world sucker, but you lost your soul
(The devil approach you us, all you do is tell a foe)

[Wyclef]
Life after death could be eternal fire
So some get blunted but you're back all on this when it's all over
Mama said a blunt was a stunt to the brain
So son say, "I don't smoke!" but on the sneak-tip he sniff coke!
He won the lotto, now he dies of an overdose
While the bum he picked a hole to sleep he wanted a deep throat
So ask yourself the question: Who's really maxin'?
Cause some check in but don't check out and either Hell or Heaven high
But to some Earth is Hell and Heaven's death
So they predict to be Haiti's and kill till there's nothin' left, hah
But I'mma hit'em with a gun, that's harder than all guns
Mic check from the temple, check the Tech
(And start the nuzzle to get wreck)
Can I get a witness? (Check the Tech)
Get wreck (Check the Tech), check the Tech
(And start the nuzzle to get wreck), can I get a witness?
(Check the Techs), here we go yo
Well I arrive let me tell you what I see in my third eye
Many die they call a battle, they got crucified
Justice, is righteous, in the eyes of the beholder
While the, younger the better but the, older the wiser
Mama used to read in deep from the book of Proverbs
But the bird said the word was absurd, have ya heard?
Knowledge - I come to teach while I increase ya decrease
Some say peace, but on a street a .45's my piece

[Pras]
Hallelujah, hallelujah, praise be to thee
Jah Almighty - COME!!
On the nineteenth of October I remember
Startin' my life as a natural leaver
Cause I lick one-two-three-four-five-six-seven shots
While any priest here builds his church on a solid rock, hit me
So feel the spirit comin' from the Heaven above
(Ay, Pras, how could you be a hood in full of so much love?)
I said: On every man chest there breathes a heart
Hip-hop where it starts, I tried to master the art, come on!!

[Intro: Wyclef Jean]
I'm just about done... Yo, let me finish tuning this guitar...
Yo, y'all ready for the show?

[Hook: Lauryn Hill]
Ready or Not! Here we come! All the biting M.C.'s and the pirates, I go run!
(Why?)Cause they are old! And we are young!
And while we're young, yes we're gonna have some fun! Here we go!
Skippity bop bop bop, skippity whoa!! Swing! (Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo!)
Skippity bop bop bop, skippity WHOA!!! SWING!! (Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo!)

[Wyclef Jean:]
You should've have died before you reach this station
Refugees we run the Border! Ay! Ay!...Ay! Ay!
You should've have died before you reach this station
Refugees we all go Murder! Now!!!

Yo! Now that I escape, selling four million plates
My beeper vibrates, like California earthquakes
But I keep a balanced head, cause you're hot, they're not
M.C.'s go Hollywood, then lose their spot on the jukebox
Still ichi bang, wack M.C.'s get the gong!
Lyrical tongue, wireless mics from Samsung
Wyclef, seduced once by an actress
Angela Basset wanted the head of Jean Baptiste
Meanwhile across town I still owe money to Carlito
Mama always say don't gamble; I'm trapped in casino
No more money in my bags; nightmares, getting closer
I slept on Elm Street, Freddy Kruger woke up with a German Luger
Black serial killer, man turns to gorilla
Provoked I change faces like Michael Jackson's Thriller
B-B-B-B-B-Boo! And you don't stop!!!

[Hook]

[Wyclef-Lauryn]
Yo, L-Boogie where you at?-I'm just adjusting my mic (three times)
Well won't ya, grab the mic and lead the blind to the light?!

[Lauryn]
If I could change the times, make rhymes, raise the babies
Give all the pigs rabies, send biting niggas to Haiti's
Clothe young ladies; chase the rainbow, find the pot
Free the third time offender once he learns to makes-a-lot
Lose the fame, take the money; Play boys, just like the bunny
Find a man with a plan, Slap a chicken, If she acts funny
Break the bank, on tank Stop niggas from acting stank
Take over your vouch free Rovers Teach a man to find Jehovah
Own the stores, own the tours Watch the record, pimps and whores
Make love, stop the wars Cop the land, like the laws
Make the last be the first, make the God respect the Earth
Change the murder rate to the birth! (Swing!)

[Hook]

[Wyclef-Pras]
Hey yo, Pras where you at?-I'm just adjusting my mic
Well won't ya, grab the mic and make the crowd react!

[Pras]
No more tours, no more scores
Por favor senor, I do the soundbite from here to El Salvador
Ready to take over, Like that! (Gun cocks)
Run your whole crew over, like that!! (Gunshot)
Buffalo soldier! Dreadlock rasta! Rather be slaughtered than be captured!
Three refugees, one usual suspect
Trapped in the firm, cause he fell to two techs
Prospects have thoughts, blood in like outlets
I can read your whole flow, just like a pamphlet
Thousands and thousands of watts, high volt!
Body as a Q-Tip, right on the asphalt
Tell the truth that you shouldn't sky off
This is Mr. Prakazrel, I don't take it as an insult
I grab the money, money! Stash the cash-n-dash, peddle on the gas
I'm clear like Everlast!

[Salaam Remi:]
(Never seen a refugee movin' so fast!)
Now catch me in Jamaica, chillin' at the break of sunsplash!

[Hook]

[Lauryn]
(Ooo-wee!) To Queens (Ooo-wee!) To New Jersey
(Ooo-wee!) To Brooklyn (Ooo-wee!) ...and Uptown
(Ooo-wee!) ...and Long Island (Ooo-wee!) ...Staten Island
(Ooo-wee!) ...U.C. (Ooo-wee!) ...Miami!
(Ooo-wee!) ...To Jamaica!

[Hook: Wyclef Jean]
Vocab, on your mind! {We used to rock the mics in the park!} (Vocab)
Vocab, in your mind! {We used to rock the mic after dark} (Vocab)
The Vocab we bring is Blunted On Reality!
So kick back, relax, with a crew called Refugees {We used to rock the mic after dark} (Vocab)

[Verse One: Wyclef Jean]
Uh to my, people who pass, I pass gas, to light my incense
I do a sundance, for those who died in the ambulance
A simple stick-up, cause affects on the wrong lad
Wrong vocab, he fell into the gap, no coming back
Your hurry is he gets buried, the streets are empty
Mom cry "misery", Little Bill waits for the adversary
Cause if it's my brother, I gotta get revenge
Action brings reaction, provoked by the street gem
That's when, oh help me, please Zsa Zsa
My niggas come to the dance, gun salute, with the revolver! (BLAOW!!)
Out of respect, you catch wreck, they blast the tech!
If your shit is wack, don't turn your back, you'll get pussy-smacked!
I don't matter the year, tears for fears, I rule the world
And in my vision, the world is science fiction
Roxanne!!! You don't have to work for money no more!!!!
And... I'm not smiling at no fake M.C.'s
Cause is it me, or do you work for the K.G.B.?
A-Schiscka Bob, he drives a Dodge, he's a nobody
Nobody's a somebody; this nobody's a spy, kid
He's the rap trader, I'm the battle fulfiller
And if I was Magilla Gorilla, the mic's my Ban-ana
So Coca-Cabana, who Anna on my scanner?
My Grandma slam-a-any crews -Ban, or surrender, Anna!
Refugee Camp, grab him! Bag him!
Throw him in the swamp, and let the swamp monsters have him!

[Hook]

[Lauryn Hill:] Vocab baby, vocab!

[Verse 2: Pras]
Then cast off from here to Mexico! You see my 4-5-6-a-be my cee-lo!
And when I rest my head it's on a peee-low! B-D-B-D-B-D-B-B-D-B-BO!
You see the skills I manifest, is very thorough!
And if you don't believe me ask Freres Jacques, hunhh!
A-Freres Jacques! A-Freres Jacques! A dorme vous? A dorme vous?
Say our father, who art in Heaven
Forgive the foolish rapper for he not know how which he be steppin'
Correctin', stopped and kept and, nuff respect to the D.J
That be selecting, that type of record
Watch out now!!! When I choose to speak
I'm forming the cipher fly east to the five percenter
Knowledge is born, to all beginners
Cast the first stone if you feel you ain't a sinner
After eight stays, we resorted to rebell
I'm packin' up my Nine to remedy my stale (?)
Ask your local mechanic, he'll tell you my esophagus is very profane!
I'm even locking Stephen King in his own ending!
God damn it! You got static?! Drop your automatic!!!
Niggas fabricating lyrics with cheap fabrics!
All originale damn man is originale good! Bah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah-Ah!

[Wyclef Jean:] Ahh, look at the youths, sick of the violence

[Hook]

[Lauryn Hill:] Vocab baby, vocab!

[Verse 3: Lauryn Hill]
The gorey got you hot cause you coop what you are!
But I've been rockin' mic's since the days of Babylon!
My pen was eucalyptus, and my rappin' was the scroll
I walked for many moons, and let the sandels jist to my control
You're swole cause you couldn't cross the burnin' sands
You never had no mercy when my people was in Egypt's land
Say, "Yes I can!" With the force of Elijah
Steppin' to you, they get irrigated like the Niger
So hide the cattle, Fugees come to battle
We'll take all your bounty, then we'll eat your vittles
I'm used to the type of poetics that mesmerize
I caught you checkin' with them Bette Davis eyes!
Surprise, surprise! You never knew a girl could stylize!
It's from the soul! I ain't freakin' with white lies
Yo, hey guys! Remember the summer of '92?
Battle after battle! Crew after crew!
So, hachoo! Fugees coming with a brand new style!
I'm rollin' with them hoodies from the H-A-I!
It takes awhile for them average niggas to get it
But once they understand they won't want to freak with this, see...
I'm like the phantom that's flying like the bird
Doin' shit you never heard, plus I come from the suburbs
Word to God! I heard ya had it kinda hard
And you got your skin scarred when they was shootin' on the boulevard!

[Hook 2x]

[Lauryn Hill:] Vocab baby, vocab!

[Intro: Lauryn Hill]
Yo, this is the Fugees.. Refugees
About to take you on a journey
Into the dimensions of the Booga-Basement
The basement, word
Hey yo, one two three! The crew is called Re-Fu-Ge-ee-es
An if you come to test the rap stylee
Stop the violence and just bring it on, willld

[Verse One: Lauryn Hill]
Hey yo I, feel kind of melancholy people think they really know me
I keep a rap-book with me while I'm driving daddy's Audi
I pay the toll fighting for my own soul
Cause the bourgeoise type of mental sucks like a black hole
But I be baitin the rebel base to bass distort the EQ
The devil's wishin they could send me back to Mogadishu
Cause I've been wild since I was a juvenile
Afro-centric profile, back when righteous rap was your style
Now kids are whylin so I ask the bad black
Boogie bandit, what's the damage, gimme the estimate then
Pray tell me when's the revolution will begin?
I turn on my TV I check out Farrakhan on CNN see
I'm like the phantom that's flying like the bird do
And things you never heard plus I come from the suburbs
Word to God, I heard you're acting kind of hard
And you got your skin scarred when they was shootin on the boulevard
(You got the vocab) I got the vocab
(On the real got the vocab) You know we got the vocab
(All my peeps got the vocab) Yeah, we got the vocab

[Lauryn] Aiyyo Praz, grab the mic and show you got the gift of gab

Then cast off from here to Mexico
You see my four-five-six a-be my Celo
And when I rest my head is on a pillow
Be-ba-dee-be, be-dee-be, be-dee-be-bo
You see the skills I manifest is very tho-rough
And if you don't believe me ask Freres Ja-cques
Mmmm, Freres Jacques, Freres Jacques
A dorme vous? A dorme vous?
WATCH OUT NOW! When I choose to speak

Check it out, here we go
Back in Eighty-TREE, no one wanted to be NAPPY
I turn on my TV, it's a dreadlock for FREE
Kill the gimmick -It's nonsense, it's no sense or value
A rapper, disaster, nobody ever told me that
"Roxanne, you don't got to work for money no more!!"... and...
Back in the days I used to listen to Kool G Rap
Way back when before guns became gats and
Run-D.M.C. used to ask Mary was she buggin?
I loved P.E., they kept me concious of what I was saying
Afrika Bambaata, Poor Righteous Teacher
Got within myself so it made me a Five Percenter
Say La-Di-Da-Di, UHH! we like to party but
My jam was BDP, with My Philosophy
Say Grandmaster Flash, MC Melle Mel
Then LL Cool J came with Rock the Bells!
See I'm the one for the crew, like a Jew is a Jew
Like Apollo got the moon, like the men who got the blue
Like the Fu got the Manchu, Shaka got the Zulu
Hawaii got the Honolulu
I got the rap lieu, so skippedy-de-bop-bop you don't stop
You do the rock-rock from hip-hop through be-bop
From be-bop to bee-bee

(You got the vocab) I got the vocab

Monkey see, monkey what? Monkey, monkey be yourself
Monkey see, monkey what? Monkey, monkey be yourself
Monkey see, monkey what? Monkey, monkey be yourself
Hey yo catch me when I'm sober, but now I drink for the belt
So pass the root straight to the right hand side
Make no mistake that the buzz is a natural high
I said it's big emergency mind your busy body
He hit me. I broke his nose. The referee's Mr Fuji
So hey to the blue jay, mocking bird don't mock
The last bird who mocked he got caught in my roughneck chicken pot
So Mr Rooster give me a crookedy croo at 6am
He looked at me a laughin' said my music would make F.M
Station. You're Haitian. You'll never get nowhere
But I sweared on my grandmother grave we'd be here
So now when I back track
I back track far enough to make a nigga run and leave his tongue back
You think I'm cool I think you're cruel so here's a shell cap
On your gluteus maximus and leave ya handicapped
Ratatatat

[Chorus: Pras]
You got the vocab
I got the vocab
You got the vocab
You know I got the vocab

Hey, yo pass the mic so I can tell 'em I got the gift o' gab

[Verse 2: Pras]
Hoboes above leave the boat for the Pope (?)
Hoboes above leave the boat for the Pope (?)
Hoboes above leave the boat for the Pope (?)
Boat people here we go Hi De Hi De Hi De Ho Yeah
Some quest for the truth, some bust a loop
And search for some knowledge that come runnin' in the woods
And if I should to choose to be one
Then I will be a thinkin' hoodlum with books and look to kill
My proof is in my puddin'
If I kill in the hood would you be say that I'm hoodin'?
Now. Let me exercise a new style that will brutalise
MCs into a warpath genocide
Nobody move, nobody get hurt. It's a homocide
So jump jump punks ready to get stuck
Evil Kenevil was my man, someone for the stunts
I'm mostly fillies, I'm just straight up front, ha
Meat ya tryin' to light up you get blast like nitrogen
Runnin' for mercy, runnin' for oxygen
Bad L.A. meat you're better off comittin' suicide
I shoot the lip so high I strip you of your carbon dioxide
Rock-a-bye the lullaby he be singin' 'Oh my'
Boof Baff another son a go die

[Verse 3: Lauryn Hill]
What's the matter with the black man? (Black man)
What's the matter with the black man? (Black man)
Now a statistic. So dreams of her become realistic
Poor bastard gets mystic I don't believe you checked the psychic
Emancipate your mind. Don't set the limit. Reach the summit
Free your spirit cause your blunted
From the lyrics I just stuttered
'Live off the streets' says the brother with the machete
'Live off the lady' says the brother with the Glock in patrol
I live logically, no weak slave to poverty
You see it's very easy to slip between the asphalt sheet
Brothers from my way they used to get mad plays
Till they caught us bustin' doughnuts 'til the break of day
Brother, my brother, you played me undercover
She wouldn't be your lover so now you tried to dis her
For sister. You missed her but ask yourself a question
Can I make a suggestion? I need a true confession
Is she skivs cause the skin that she's in makes you sin?
Does you hit her just to get her integrate another sister?
Mister. I asked him for a hanky. He asked if he could spank me
So why'd you disrespect me, sir?
Were you thinking I'm misguided or were you tryin to hide it
That you had no father figure
Which? Check out your wackness. It won't distrust my blackness
I would offer a smack, but don't think that it would help this

[Hook: Lauryn Hill + Pras]
What's the matter with the black man (Black man)
All original gunman dem original good (Bahahahahahahaha)
All original gunman dem original good (Bahahahahahahaha)



Come jackin' it up an' I bad an' me fell in ma booby trap
With a rappin' up for the eight track play back laid back sit back
An I'll 

[?] an me runnin' 

[?] as a matter a fact
Cause I trappin' a back like a cool six pack now bring it back. Woah!

United we stand, divided we crumble
What's the flavour? More Babylon, more Babylon, more Babylon fall
What's the flavour? More Babylon, more Babylon, more Babylon fall

These days every man want to be a god
Lay down the gun every man on the floor
But the real gunman him not play Hollywood role
Because he pull out his gun and send another boy down
Watch us bleed. Another gunman go bleed
Watch us bleed. If I used up all my dust I got 

[?]
Watch us bleed. Me up an' comin' ready
Watch us bleed. Watch us for original Tranzlator Crew
Oh, er, every time we come, we come correct, see
We out

[Lauryn Hill] Yo!

[Wyclef Jean] One time!

I was born by the river in a tenement
And oh.. my poor mother, she could hardly pay the rent

[Refrain:]
It's been a long a long time coming
But I know oohh.. a change is going to come
Awww yes, it will

[Wyclef Jean] Two time!

Yeah, it's been too hard living and I'm afraid to die (Why?)
I don't know what's out there, yeaah, yeaaah.. beyond the sky
Say it Wyclef, Say it

[Wyclef Jean] Check it out, uh uh, Awww Ma

Yo, See I go oohh.. to my brother
And I say brother, help me please
And he winds up, he winds up, knocking me, knocking me
Yeah, huh.. back down on my knees Ohhh!

[Wyclef Jean] Three time!

It's been times when I didn't think that I would last for long
But now we think they're bound... to carry on

[Wyclef Jean]
This has been the Fugees: L Boogie, Prize Well, Wyclef
The Refugees are OUT!

[Wyclef Jean (Lauryn Hill):]
Yes, Refugee Camp  (Yeah, Yeah Refugee Camp unh! Ahh!)
Yo...It never stops, what?!
We comin' back!  (Murder dat buoy!)
Ninety seven to two thousand, check it!  (Ha! Ha! La!)

[Wyclef]
Jericho sound... No Woman No Cry (We 'bout to set it!)
Yes! Yes! (We 'bout to set it!) Yo!  We 'bout to set it! (L-Boogie, yes yo, what?!)
We 'bout to set it! (We'bout to set it!) Yes! We 'bout to set it! (We 'bout to set it!)

[Lauryn "L-Boogie" Hill - Verse One]
Yo, L won't take the mark though I swim with sharks
I make the dark see the light
Board the ark for forty nights
Times reveal a broken seal, like a (pause) fiend steal
You for fake, I'm for real, like Jesus Christ's last meal
You make deals with devils
The soul descends infinite levels
Pray to God I see the next, rescripture in Holy text then
Ask to be forgiven for premarital sex
In the same breath I speak with death about the times
And how many joined his army over bullshit rhymes
You see L change the topic, clear as fiber-optics
Make talk about your clothes become microscopic decisions
Young bitches in prison, messing 'round with that life
Thug, drug dealer wife
Consequence cut like a knife, then we learned that
Only Jah and God can protect
You know the story, housing projects is purgatory
So, teach the youths they got more rights than Miranda
Tell 'em this whole shit is propaganda! Word!

[Wyclef]
Yo, sound system, you know what I'm sayin'?!
Jericho Sound...System!
Turn up your sound...Systems!

[Wyclef - Verse Two]
Yo, here he comes down the road
A black Maserati, what up Raheem? (Whatup?! Whatup?! Whatup?!)
He never fought unless necessary
You shot at?  He shot back
The whole block felt the bang
Last man to fight with his fists his name was Jackie Chan
Not Charles Brownson
Once you hear the whistle, even Grandmas is stackin' up on old wooden pistols
Nobody's thinking by the time you're done blinking
Cold freezer, so your body won't be stinkin'
Read the will, he left the bills for his daughter Soleil
Last words written just before he got killed
Woman cry (Crying)
Why wasn't I the one?
Not knowing, the omen was her son DAMIEN! (Demonic voice in background)
Father forgive 'em, for they know not what they done
Their meaning of fun is who can draw the quicker gun
Easy with the fizi
Second rate the violence
Those who disagree hear your ashes blow in silence!

[Wyclef]
Yo!  Turn up your sound system!
This is the Refugee Camp!
Jericho Sound System!
Know what I'm sayin'?!
Te Bass production!
Refugee Camp collaboration!
Turn up your sound system!
Come on!  Turn up your boom system!
This is how we do, turn it up, come on!

[Prakazrel "Pras" - Verse Three]
From the heart of Kingston, to the streets of Brooklyn-Marcy
All the way to the highest peak of any frequency, unhh!
Illegal aliens, them all run invasions
Broadcasting all over your radio stations (Radio station!)
Mathematics, lead me to believe there's mysteries in numbers
Lightning and thunder
Enough ribbons in the sky (Ribbon In The Sky!) to make Stevie Wonder
And man it works, to say I come from down under (Come from down under!)
The wiz kid got no ride; You frontin' at the bar (You frontin' at the bar!)
You ain't a star; you rolled up in somebody else's car (You rolled up in somebody else's car!)
You know the deal!  BMW, Black Man Walking, came home your
Timberlands was talkin'! (Uh huh)
Niggas jealous cause the truth I said in Zealots
Well let me tell it...Without Premier you couldn't sell it!!!

[Lauryn:]
(Murder dat buoy!!!)

[Wyclef - outro]
We 'bout to set it, Yes! Yes! Jericho Sound! L-Boogie you know what I'm sayin?
We gonna come like Star Wars, you know what I'm saying? We 'bout to set it!
1997 to the year 2001! Ichi-Bang!  Even in Japan!
Yo, L you know the flavor! Battle star galactical!
Who wanna battle?! Battle star galactical!
Come on!  You know the flavor! Jericho Allstars
(Something in Creole)
You know what I'm saying? You know, like the V
Remember V, the old show we used to watch that?
Yo...You know what I mean?! We 'bout to set it!
Know what I'm sayin'! We 'bout to take y'all, you know what I'm sayin'?!
Remember Mork & Mindy?  We used to sit back, Happy Days
You know what I'm saying?  We 'bout to set it, but yo!
Kids ain't playin' that no more, know what I'm sayin'?
Niggas packin' pistols, once you hear the whistle, we 'bout to set it!
You know what I mean?  Yo!  You know the flavor!  You know what I mean?!
Yo man!  You know what I'm saying?! Good Times, J.J....

[L-Boogie]
Brethren don't cut me when I'm going
I don't hear myself
We bout to drop, drop drop drop
You can bring the beat up a little bit in the headphones
Bring the beat up a little bit
We bout to drop. We bout to drop, drop, drop, drop

[L-Boogie]
I got Moxie, I'm so damn foxy
Industry try to block me like cops and paparazzi
Full stop, don't copy, just cop me properly
Everybody same policy, universal equality
Responsibility, polity, to survive economically
Some people do it comically, fruits of freedom, equality (Bing!)
Invest your money properly, people owe me apology (Ha!)
Intellectual property, stealing stolen commodity
Souls searching or controlling and robbery, cold lack of camaraderie
Clones, copycats bother me, mine, own, blind cats, follow me
Honesty, honesty, honestly, all these jokes are common-league
Puppets with no autonomy, yup it's Fugees entirely
(Chorus Clef) + 

[L-Boogie]
I see you looking but you better take it easy
Tell your crew I said tell 'em take it easy
Here's come the rocket launcher, you better take it easy
Take it easy, take it easy 

[too sleazy]
Too much ex mami, take it easy
Good with the sex mami, you'll be like, take it easy 

[Ay papi]
Better take it easy, take is easy, take it easy

[Clef] + (L-Boogie)
You movin bricks but you better take it easy
Here's a tip, you're too flashy
I don't tip twice, but you best friend he DT
And that dog sniffin in the back ain't Lassie
And I ain't rhymed in a minute, but ya'll ain't catch up
And that ain't blood on your shirt, man that's ketchup (That's ketchup)
Picture Clef getting a writer to give him help
I'd rather kill myself become a ghost and write for myself (OH MY GOD!!)
Cuss I'm the top celebrity, top celebrity, top celebrity, MC (Bing!)
I flow for the thugs, gypsies, and hippies (Bing!)
A ghetto maestro with a Nat Turner flow (Bing!)
Malcolm X come out, hit the Klu Kulx Show (SHOOWOOWOO)

(Chorus Clef) + 

[L-Boogie]
I see you looking but you better take it easy
Tell your crew I said tell 'em take it easy
Here's come the rocket launcher, you better take it easy
Take it easy, take it easy 

[too sleazy]
Too much ex mami, take it easy
Good with the sex mami, you'll be like, take it easy 

[Ay papi]
Better take it easy, take is easy, take it easy

[L-Boogie]
Don't you know originals get plagerized, majors minors, must supervise
Haters, Climbers get scrutinized, Placaters, Blind and stupid guys
Wicked people choose homicide, Dregs of society heathen 'em
Beggars, bogus misleading dem, Nigra, Negro, Negrito 'em
Angelitos con libre dem, Chico's, Chica's completing them
Addiction, fiction, bleeding them, capitalism eating them
Misunderstanding cheatin them, The ignorance defeating them
True loyalty is leaving them, got royalty believing them
Eyes open deceiving them, Reconciling, Receiving them
Reckless driving and grieving them, Matthew Andrew and Peter them
(Slow down)
We 'bout to reconcile (repeat)
We 'bout to reconcile (reconcile)
We 'bout to reconcile(recon, recon, reconcile)
We 'bout to reconcile, (tell 'em to give off my style) (Slow Down)
We 'bout to reconcile (reconcile like Public Enemy)
We 'bout to reconcile (Slow Down) (reconciliation) (tell 'em to get off my style)
We 'bout to reconcile(running with my crew again)
We 'bout to reconcile (Slow Down) (tell them to get my off style) (repeat)

[Pras] - (Overlapping L-Boogie)
(Ay yo!)
(Yo yo yo yo yo!)
Stop the track, what ya'll thought I wasn't coming (Yeah right)
Been in the L.A., few flicks, few millions
Back with the Fugees, foo-fighting for a few billions
Dub plate dealing, Sound Boy Killing
Anything we do, we want that cap for me realin?
Angela, Simone, Michelle, you know them willin
Can't fight the feelin, when I pull in the SFR
Every girl love's a ghetto superstar (that's Pras baby)
Run hip hop like pinstripe Lees
And I got love for my crew like Big had for Cease (C's)
Pull and sqeeze on these MC's
Man, I don't really wanna do it—take it easy

[Clef]
I see you looking but you better take it easy
Tell your goons that they better take it easy
Here's come the rocket launcher, take it easy
Take it easy, you better take it easy (L-Boogie: too sleazy)
Too much ex mami, take it easy
Good with the sex you'll be like take it easy (Ay papi)
Mami take it easy, take is easy, you better take it easy

[Clef]
We got L-Boogie in the house (Lauryn: what)
Prazwell in the house
Clef
Jerry Wonder, yeah

Big Ro (Rohan) I see you in the back
Let's get this thing started
Let's stay focused, focused, focused, focused

Oh, If you don't know what's goin on man
The Fugees back on the street, serious thing right now
You scared yet, ah pack your dibby dibby dub box

[Intro: Wyclef, Lauryn Hill (Wyclef)]
Yo wassup, this the Fugees
To all the young people
Live on sesame street haha (Clap your hands)
Can you tell me how to get? How to get to Sesame Street?
(Big Bird and Snuffy holdin' it down, check it out, here we go!)

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill]
Be yourself (Just be yourself)
Easy as A-B-C (A-B-C)
Can't be no one else (No one else!)
Just happy to be me! (Yeah! Yeah!)

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean, Pras]
Hey yo, the "A" is for achievement
Hey yo, the "B" is for beneficent
And the "C" is for commitment
And the "D" is for diligent
What about the "E", the "F", the "G", the "H", the "I", the "J?"
I'm in my P.J.'s, I'm drinkin' O.J

[Pre-Chorus: Lauryn Hill]
Yo, the big city, just like I pictured it (What?!)
Millions of people rushing around real quick
Each one's original, one of a kind, unique (That's right!)
So, kick back and listen while L-Boogie speaks
Not trying to be different, just doing they own thing
So come on everybody, clap your hands and sing (Just sing y'all!)

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill]
Be yourself (Just be yourself)
Easy as A-B-C (A-B-C)
Can't be no one else (No one else!)
Just happy to be me! (Happy to be yourself)
Be yourself (Just be yourself)
Easy as A-B-C (Yo, it's not that hard)
Can't be no one else (No one else)
Just happy to be me! (Uh huh ah)

[Verse 2: Pras, Wyclef (Pras)]
Hey yo, the "K", the "L", the "M", the "N", the "O", the "P"
For "Prazwell" in the place to be!
Hey yo, the "Q's" for quiet
The "R" for riot
The "S", the "T", the "U", the "V's" for vowels (Vowels!)
The "W", "X", the "Y", the "Z's" for Zorro! See you tomorrow!
Yeah, fly like an eagle (Fly, fly)
Well it's the Fugees
On Sesame, clap your hands do a dance with L-Jiggy

[Verse 3: Lauryn Hill]
Now Snuffy and Big Bird are having a good time
They're walking and gawking and trying to talk to a mime (Mime)
Here, in the square where they just seen it all (What?!)
But they ain't never seen a yellow bird seven feet tall!

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill]
Be yourself (Just be yourself)
Easy as A-B-C (Yo yo, it's not that hard)
Can't be no one else (No one else!)
Just happy to be me! (Yo, I'm happy to be myself)
Be yourself (Just be yourself!)
Easy as A-B-C (A-B-C)
Can't be no one else (If you can do that)
Just happy to be me! (Ha, yeah, yeah)

[Outro: Wyclef, Pras]
It's a lovely day in my neighborhood come on, Snuffy up in here It's a lovely day in my neighborhood (Wyclef up in here)
It's all good (L-Boogie up in here....)
Prazwell up in here, in my neighborhood
(Refugee Camp Allstars... yeah)

[Intro: Sly & Robbie]
From out the Refugee Camp we present to you, the group we call Fu-Gee
With Wyclef and Lauryn, Prazwell with the international Sly & Robbie on the hardcore reggae beat
Now my selector! Come now

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
(Can I feel the vibe?)
(Can I feel the vibe?)
We used to be number ten
Now we're permanent one
Wyclef, Preacher's Son, Ichiban
Listen Mrs. Tin Can
I'm your candy handy man
Me without you is like American without the Band Stand
Cool fellow, dancehall stay mellow
All that guntalk who would have thought you died yellow
Damn, another hero wannabe
Now he sleeps with his friends in the mortuary
Dude, I find it rude, when you intrude
My pistol nozzle hits your nasal
Doo-doo comes out your anal
Just because your buff, don't play tuff
'Cause I'll reverse the earth and turn your flesh back to dust

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill & (Wyclef Jean)]
Ooh, la-la-la
It's the way that we rock when we're doin' our thing
Ooh, la-la-la
It's the natural la that the Refugees bring
Ooh, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sweet thing
(She love me like she never before, ayy)

[Verse 2: John Forte]
Dig it! I stay high off the Fu-Gee-La
Bust when we rush through
You must  knew Ruckus Crew got G's like the refu's
So F whoever want to test
Bring me stress, west coast back to east
Grab my toast when I reach
Truly curvin', swervin, lifestyle is urban
Sippin' bourbon, surviving
We real to keep the word when
A boy want fa test this set
Then you get wet-up
Just a bit to unprepared to to shoot him, fair bet

[Verse 3: Lauryn Hill]
Fake bullets can't scar me
I can smell the weak out like safari
Play you out like Atari
Sacrifice you Hari Kari
And I'm sorry
To every single rapper, Dick and Harry
Saying they want to spar me
'Cause how thick my repertoire and my memoir be
Reminding me of eating Calamari in the Kalahari
With a band of Rastafari so
Ha-ha-ha-ha, you shouldn't diss refugees, and
Ha-ha-ha-ha, you whole sound set booty, and

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill & (Wyclef Jean)]
Ooh, la-la-la
It's the way that we rock when we're doin' our thing
Ooh, la-la-la
It's the remix sound that the Refugees bring
Ooh, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sweet thing
(She love me like she never before, ayy)

[Verse 4: Pras]
I sit 90 degrees underneath palm trees
Sitting in the cool breeze in the West Indies
Flea to sea, ship my keys
On the Santa Maria, sip Sangria with señoritas
(They keep telling me this and telling me that)
They smile in my face then they talk behind my back
But what they lack is the facts about my stats
My rap impact will kill you softly like Roberta Flack

[Verse 5: Wyclef Jean]
Ayo, what's goin' on?
Armageddon come you know we soon done
Gun by my side just in case I gotta rump
A boy on the side of Babylon
Tryin' to front like you're down with Mount Zion
Yo, what's goin' on?
Armageddon come you know we soon done
Gun by my side just in case I gotta rump
A boy on the side of Babylon
Tryin' to front like you're down with Mount Zion (Zion)

[Verse 6: Akon]
Call Mister Martin, tell him to built a coffin
Today is death season, a hundred MCs are get murderin' (Stop it)
Call Mister Martin, tell him to built a coffin
Today is death season, a hundred MCs are get murderin', ha-ha-ha

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill & (Wyclef Jean)]
Ooh, la-la-la
It's the way that we rock when we're doin' our thang
Ooh, la-la-la
It's the remix sound that the Refugees bring
Ooh, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sweet thing
(She love me like she never before, ayy)
Ooh, la-la-la
It's the way that we rock when we're doin' our thang
Ooh, la-la-la
It's the remix sound that the Refugees bring
Ooh, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sweet thing
(She love me like she never before, ayy)

[Verse 7: Akon]
Call Mister Martin, tell him to built a coffin
Today is death season, for Akon is MC murderin' (Stop it)
Call Mister Martin, tell him to built a coffin
Today is death season, a hundred MCs are get murderin'

[Outro]
Refugee camp (Stop it, oh no)
Refugee camp (Stop it, oh no)
Refugee camp (Stop it, oh no)
Refugee camp (Stop it, oh no)

[Verse 1: Omega & Wyclef]
Where I was born, nothing is promised
My life is filled with less hope than the prophecies of Nostradamus
Omega marks the ending of predictability
Birth of agility
Who will it be to test me and expose their futility?
Iron like a lion from Zion, stop tryin' so hard
I think I smell your brain cells fryin'
The family's behind you if you're worthy
Philosophies developed deep in the back streets of dirty Jersey
Troops with skully hats and Timberland boots
No more breakdancing for loot, niggas hustle and shoot
In the Garden State, it grows stink weeds and criminals
Government funds are minimal, oppression's subliminal (Yo)

[Verse 2: Wyclef]
These days it's hard for we to find peace of mind
Between insanity and sanity there lies a thin line
Some dwell in hotels with jezebels
A stone age and fall a victim to the plague
Unclean bad dreams of Wyclef being a fiend
One last kiss from my sweet serpentine
Eliminate, break, navigate
To rejuvenate thoughts of suicide with my nickel plate
Reconcil'ation came from my enemy-friend
Who said, "Family don't bend, we stay solid 'til the end"
Now who would think that your best friend
Would be your worst enemy and your enemy your best friend?
Stare into the air, inspiration from the atmosphere
I think of old ghosts that ain't even here
Like Alex Haley, take notes on his biography
My family tree consists of street refugees
A ghetto land where we talk slang
Stolen cars bang like my chitty bang-bang
Shebang for the head, we ain't sellin' cocaine today
So refrain and let my family reign, okay

[Chorus: Omega & Wyclef]
Just walkin' the streets death can take you away
It's never guaranteed that you'll see the next day
At night the evil armies of Shaton don't play
So defend the family, that's the code to obey
But if I fall asleep and death takes me away
Don't be surprised, son, I wasn't put here to stay
At night the evil armies of Shaton don't play
So the family sticks together and we never betray (Nah, fuck that)

[Verse 3: Wyclef]
Yo, fifty-two pick-ups, no cops around
Fifty-two thousand in cash, I don't want no savings bonds
Have the money ready, I smell something fishy
Your wife's in my custody, one false move, you'll find her body in the sea (Don't move, don't move)
That's the voice of the kid, that's the kidnapper
I do my work and then I catch my ticket to Jamaica
Meet me in the alley, make sure you bring the money
This ain't the seventies, I'm far from a jive turkey

[Verse 4: Lauryn]
My circle, it can't be broken open, cut-throatin', provokin'
Record promotin', tokin', chokin' on they words like smokin'
'Cause we soft spoken doesn't mean that we've forgotten
Your booty smell rotten and one day you will be gotten
See, jokers is scatter-brained, their focus is unrestrained
My army is trained, you never find us beefin' in vain
'Cause I've seen fire and I've seen rain
You claim fame while modest niggas remain
I can judge a character like Ito judge a verdict
And if you bringin' threats, I give you sex if I ain't heard it
See, poppin' shit's about your attitude and how you word it
I seen the biggest niggas on the blocks get murdered, and they deserved it
Or so the beast said when they served it, that shit is nervous
So what's my purpose? Family, we must preserve it
Your number's retired, I hope you like the hell fires
You'll be screamin', "Murder She Wrote" like Chaka Demus and Pliers

[Chorus: Omega, Lauryn]
Just walkin' the streets death can take you away
It's never guaranteed that you'll see the next day
At night the evil armies of Shaton don't play
So defend the family, that's the code to obey
If I should fall asleep and death take me away
Don't be surprised, son, I wasn't put here to stay
At night the evil armies of Shaton don't play
So the family stick together and we never betray, yeah

[Verse 5: John Forte & Wyclef]
We used to jump rope, but now we gun hold
Bustin' shots off of project rooftops
Sending signals with the blunt smoke
Ahk, don't talk a lot if you can't hold it in lock
If you think lips sink ships, imagine full Glock clips
I hold a glass of Remy Martin, gettin' milks by the carton
Extortin' the lightweights for thinkin' they important
The night pays in heavenly ways, ain't nothin' free
I ask knowledge in your family and step into your B.I. 
You see I stay on top of shit like a fly
My niggas reach when we got beef then jet down to South Beach
Your mouthpiece is yappin', I hear it in your rappin'
My family is thick so that bullshit could never happen (Yo)

[Chorus: Wyclef & Lauryn]
Just walkin' the streets death can take you away
It's never guaranteed that you'll see the next day
At night the evil armies of Shaton don't play
So defend the family, that's the code to obey
But if I should fall asleep and death takes me away
Don't be surprised, son, I wasn't put here to stay
At night the evil armies of Shaton don't play
So the family stick together and we never betray

[Skit: Shannon Briggs]
Yo, what you say?
Yo, word to mother, yo, I'll punch you and bust your whole head, kid
I swear to God, this is Shannon Briggs, I get paid to knock people out
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, Wyclef, chill, don't even hold me
Yo, word to mother, I'll— I'll— word, yo, chill, yo
I'm with the Fugees, what? You know what I'm sayin'? What?
Some come from nowhere
To watch this caravan

[Interlude: Lauryn]
Now this happen to be the one and only 

[?]

[4:54] of the 

[?]

[4:54] crew

[?]

[4:57] dancehall session
And we don't play with sound clash
Soundbwoy get ah neck bash and he pussy dusted
Strumming dub plates with our fingers (You heard?)
Eliminate sounds with our song (No)
Killing a sound boy with this sound
Killing a sound boy with this sound (No)
Taking sound boys' lives with this dub
Killing him softly (You heard?) with this sound

[Intro: Wyclef]
(Bust) Yeah, this is the Fugees (Ahh, yeah)
Outsidaz in here (This happens on the block every day)
So, you wanna be a cowboy?
Everybody, get your guns and meet me in the back right now

[Chorus: Wyclef]
Oh-lay-hee
Everyone wants to be a cowboy, grab your gun, boys
Oh-lay-hee
.45 by my side, do he live? No, the nigga die

[Verse 1: Wyclef & Pace Won]
Zen, zen-zen-zen, zen-zen-zen
You shot your bullet, but the bullet went— (Err)
Desperado, new word for rudeboy
I pull out my gun and plug two like Trugoy
Wyclef, Pace Won, yo, this was how the West was won
Our motto, a true desperado
Rappers want to be actors
So they play the Jesse James call-up card
And get they bones fractured
You ain't got no guns, you off to the precinct
Inside tough guys are feminine like Sheena Easton
Woman cry, woman cry, son still dies
Thrown off the building like The Fall Guy
Caved in the grave 'cause you didn't know how to behave (Huh)
Playin' cowboy, now you sleep with the slaves
Who's the desperado sellin' bottles in the alley
On some villain shit, wearin' a mask like Jim Carrey?
With his gat cocked, stinkin' up the crack spot
Pacewon dies with both eyes on the jackpot
The town that I'm from beggars eat cat chowder
Sundance Kid is the everyday purse snatcher (Gimme that)
If you see him coming, you better start running
Like a terrorist I guarantee you he'll be humming
Dynamite, dynamite, Clef I got the cash
Yo, let's skip town like Harlem Nights

[Chorus: Wyclef]
Oh-lay-hee
Everyone wants to be a cowboy, grab your gun, boy
Oh-lay-hee
.45 by my side, do he live? No, the nigga die

[Verse 2: Lauryn Hill & Rah Digga]
We make moves in stage coaches, Rah Digga likes the roaches
If anyone approaches, we like noches buenos
Then I compose a poem for the many gun-slingers
R&B singers perpetrating guns with two fingers
My style is perhaps one of the foulest
I inhale large clouds of smoke through my chalice
(Buckin' at stars) And write rhymes for hours
The ghetto missy, drinkin' whiskey sours
Bust this scenario, can't no other niggas in the barrio
From North to Ontario, tame us when we in stereo
'Cause me and Rashida rock the battles
It's apparent you're no talent, 'cause you're blazin' in your saddle
Watch these rap bitches get all up in your pockets
Then bounce with accountants that give me good stock tips
'Cause props is up (Rah Digga)
Digga's through the roof, burnin' niggas like I'm 90 proof
And for all y'all head beaters, the lead eaters
The cheaters soon to be retreaters
While mamacitas carry real heaters
I rock the doobie and L rocks the Nubian twists
Nine-six, motherfuckers gettin' dissed

[Chorus: Wyclef & Young Zee]
Oh-lay-hee
Everyone wants to be a cowboy, grab your gun, boys
Oh-lay-hee
.45 by my side, do he live? No, the nigga die (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Pras & Young Zee]
When the Outs hooked up with the refugees
It be more niggas than the NAACP (Mad niggas)
Comin' up on weed of all types
Smokin' home-grown out tobacco pipes (C'mon)
You've got to know when to hold 'em
Know when to fold 'em
I can take the sunshine, piss in your wine
Steal your concubine, walk away with your gold mine
So ooh, ahh, ahh-chi-ka
Mama-se, mama-sa, mama-ma-ku-sa
Fuck the sheriff, I shot John Wayne
Push him off the runaway train in the movie Shane
Yeah, me and that kid, um, what's his name?
That would be me, Young Zee from No Brain
Smokin' pure from the health food store
While my whore slap cops like Zsa Zsa Gabor
Fuck with Outs ,it's like those Islam brothers
We march through your hood with a million motherfuckers
So let's get high off the fu-gee-la
When the east is in the house like I'm Blahzay Blah'

[Verse 4: Forté]
When pandemonium strikes and midnight hits
Full moon splits soft niggas and the lunatics on some absurd shit
You talk back, hustlin' crack don't make you bigger
Niggas who take your measurements quick don't make it quicker
Stick and slide with vigor, city streets hot like liquor
21 gun salutin', shootin' niggas from the roof and
Got nerve to mouth about it and the weight you claim you movin'
Your whole style is loose and we gon' sew it like it's cotton
You fail to recognize that everybody could get gotten
The bounty on your head says you dead by mañana
Pop babies whisperin' that there's a body drop behind the lot
Police blew up the spot and locked the whole block
Medina is the east side of town lounge, never 'til we yawnin'
Gun play is regular, front page is the bonus
Life will keep existing as I'm shittin' on opponents
Life will keep existing as I'm shittin' on opponents

[Chorus: Wyclef & Lauryn Hill]
Oh-lay-hee
Everyone wants to be a cowboy, grab your gun, boy
Oh-lay-hee
.45 by my side, do he live? No, the nigga die (Cowboys)

[Interlude]
Yo, man
It seem like we tryna get everybody, but they gettin' us
You know what I'm sayin'?
But, you know
No need to cry 'cause everything gon' be alright, man
It's gon' be alright, you know?
You know, it's just ill, yo
Last night, you know, all I seen was bullets and feet runnin' and backs, you know
And when the smoke cleared it was a little joker on the ground, man
No— Had to be no younger than thirteen, fourteen years old
Blood pourin' from his head
His mother on her— mother on her knees cryin', you know
Cryin' her head off
Tomorrow's headline is gonna be "The Death of Another Nigga"
You know what I'm sayin'?
"The Death of Another Nigga", you know?
That's how it always is
We cryin' for a afterlife while they just steal this one

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
We used to be number 10, now we're permanent at one
In the battle lost my finger, mic became my arm
Pistol nozzle hits your nasal, blood becomes lukewarm
Tell the woman be easy, nah squeeze the Charmin
Test Wyclef, see death flesh get scorned
Beat you so bad make you feel like you ain't wanna be born, Jean
And tell your friends stay the hell out of my lawn
Chicken George become Dead George
Stealin' chickens from my farm
Damn, another dead pigeon
If you're mafiosos then I'm bringin' on Haitian Sicilians
Nobody's shootin', my body's made of hand grenade
Girl bled to death while she was tongue-kissin' a razor blade
That sounds sick, maybe one day I'll write a horror
Blackula comes to the ghetto (Stick 'em up), jacks an Acura
Stevie Wonder sees crack babies
Becomin' enemies of their own families

[Pre-Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
Armageddon come, you know-a we soon done
Gun by my side just in case I gotta rump
A boy on the side of Babylon
Tryin' to front like you're down with Mount Zion

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill & (Wyclef Jean)]
Ooh, la-la-la
It's the way that we rock when we're doin' our thing
Ooh, la-la-la
It's the natural la that the Refugees bring
Ooh, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sweet thing
(She love me like she never before, ayy)

[Verse 2: Lauryn Hill]
Yeah, in saloons we drink Boone's and battle goons 'til high noon
Bust rap tunes on flat spoons, take no shorts like poom poom's
See hoochies pop coochies for Gucci's and loochies
Find me in my Mitsubishi, eatin' sushi, bumpin' Fugees
Hey, hey, hey, try to take the crew and we don't play play
Say, say, say, like Paul McCartney, not hardly
Oddly enough, I can see right through your bluff
Niggas huff and they puff but they can't handle us, we bust
'Cause we fortified, I could never hide
Seen "Cooley High", cried when Cochise died
I'm twisted, blacklisted by some other negroes
Don't remove my Polos on the first episode
Ha-ha-ha-ha, you shouldn't diss refugees, and
Ha-ha-ha-ha, you whole sound set booty, and
Ha-ha-ha-ha, you have to respect Jersey
'Cause I'm superfly when I'm super-high
On the Fu-Gee-La

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill & (Wyclef Jean)]
Ooh, la-la-la
It's the way that we rock when we're doin' our thang
Ooh, la-la-la
It's the natural LA that the Refugees Bring
Ooh, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sweet thing
(She love me like she never before, ayy)

[Verse 3: Pras]
I sit 90 degrees underneath palm trees
Smokin' Beedi as I burn my calories
Brooklyn roof tops become Brooklyn tee-pees
Who that be? Enemy, wanna see the death of me
From Hawaii to Hawthorne, I run marathons, like
Buju Banton, I'm a true champion, like
Farrakhan reads his daily Qur'an
It's a phenomenon, lyrics fast like Ramadan

[Pre-Chorus: Wyclef]
What's goin' on? Armageddon come you know we soon done
Gun by my side just in case I gotta rump
A boy on the side of Babylon
Tryin' to front like you're down with Mount Zion
What's goin' on? Armageddon come you know we soon done
Gun by my side just in case I gotta rump
A boy on the side of Babylon
Tryin' to front like you're down with Mount Zion

[Chorus: Lauryn Hill & (Wyclef Jean)]
Ooh, la-la-la
It's the way that we rock when we're doin' our thang
Ooh, la-la-la
It's the natural LA that the Refugees Bring
Ooh, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sweet thing
(She love me like she never before, ayy)
Ooh, la-la-la
It's the way that we rock when we're doin' our thang
Ooh, la-la-la
It's the natural LA that the Refugees Bring
Ooh, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sweet thing
(She love me like she never before, ayy)

[Outro]
Yo kid, we gotta get our family together, man
You know, we gotta get organized
We just can't be out here, you know, just high and smoked up
And whatever, we gotta get our stuff organized
Whatever we gon' do, we gon' do it right (Wassup girl, what you want?)

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
Mista, mista
Can I get five dollars
So I can get something to eat?
Hell no, motherfucka
You can't get no money from me
'Cause every time I give you a dollar
You go get shot up with more and more needles
And you tell me that you're drug-free
Drug-free

[Verse 2: Wyclef Jean]
Mista, mista
I haven't ate anything for a week
Can I get a quarter?
Hell no, motherfucka
What can a quarter get you?
Nothing, motherfucka
You are just fucked up
Off them fucked up drugs
You know you need to fucking leave alone
But you keep telling me that you're drug-free
Motherfucka
You ain't drug-free
You're a fiend

[Bridge]
And every time I try to help you
You pretend as if it's okay
Then later on the week
You go back
To shootin' needles, to sniffin'
Oh, motherfucka, but you told me you were drug-free
Drug-free

[Outro]
You ain't drug-free, motherfucka
So you damn well can't get no motherfuckin' money from me

[Intro]
A dedication to all the refugees worldwide
One time

[Verse 1]
Say, say, say
I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Brooklyn
Oba-observing the crookedness
As it mingled with the good people we meet
Good friends we had, oh, good friends we've lost
Along the way
In this great future, you can't forget your past
So dry your tears, I say
And to my peeps who passed away

[Chorus]
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry, say, say, say
Oh, hey, little sister, don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry

[Verse 2]
Say, say, say
I remember when we used to rock, oh
In a project yard in Jersey
And little Georgie would make the firelight
As stolen cars passed through the night
And then we'd hit the corner store
For Roots, paper, and brew
My drink's my only remedy
For pain of losing family
But while I'm gone, shorty

[Bridge]
Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright
Fugees come to the dance tonight
Everything is gonna be alright
Everything is gonna be alright
Oh, everything is gonna be alright
The gunman's in the house tonight
But everything is gonna be alright
Oh, ah, oh-ah
Oh, ah, oh-ah
Oh, ah, oh-ah
Oh, ah, oh-ah
Oh, ah, oh-ah
Oh, ah, oh-ah (I'm high)
Oh, ah, oh-ah
Oh, ah, oh-ah

[Chorus]
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry
Hey, little sister, don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry

[Verse 3]
Say, say, say
I remember when we used to sit
In a government yard in Trenchtown
Oba-observing the hypocrites
As they mingled with the good people we meet
Good friends we had, oh, good friends we've lost
Along the way, hey
In this great future, you can't forget your past
So dry your tears, I say

[Chorus]
No woman, no cry
No woman, no cry, say, say, say
Hey, little sister, don't shed no tears
No woman, no cry

[Outro]
And to my peeps who passed away
Oh, ah, oh-ah
Oh, ah, oh-ah
Oh, ah, oh-ah
Oh, ah, oh-ah
Oh, ah, oh-ah

[Intro: Wyclef Jean]
(Y-Y-You rockin' loud but you ain't sayin' nothin')
It's time I settle the score
(I play my enemies like a game of chess)
(Playin' Mr. Big, I'm gonna get you sucka)
(Ha, ha, ha, ha, you shouldn't diss Refugees)
Soldiers
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right (It's time I settle the score)
Left, right, left, right, left, left, left, left (It's time I settle the score)

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
Look to the rhyme (Rhyme), rum to the ripple (Ripple)
Single, but at times I come in triple
Blaow, blaow, put the heater to your head
Now you dead
Wyclef don't give a ooh if you're dead
Rah, rah, let me attack just like a black cat
You in the wrong neighborhood, check your map
Ooh, you've gotta go for backup to do what you gotta do
So you'll be back with France CU
Traitor in your crew is mafo heat
You put poison in my tea and kill the toad, but I'll be back with the centipede
I'm on some new technique, drunken bamboo
A-hoo, a-hoo, a-hoo, I'm taking all crews, what?
Competition, stimulation for the rap man
Losers, check your tooters as I'm suckin' on your girl hooters
Don't play macho 'cause you got the gun, son
'Cause if you gotta reload (Man)

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
(You rocking loud but you ain't sayin' nothin')
It's time I settle the score
(Too many emcees, not enough mics)
(Ready or not, here I come)
(Ha, ha, ha, ha, you shouldn't diss Refugees)
Soldiers
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right (It's time I settle the score)
Left, right, left, right, left, left, left, left (It's time I settle the score)

[Verse 2: Wyclef Jean]
Yo, Wyclef the multi-talented, average heads can't handle it
I'll bring it to you live, only if you want it (Only if you want it)
Me and my guitar go back like the days of the R MC's (Come on)
(Check out my melody)
The W-Y-C-L-E-F, Wyclef
Through any contest, I'm victorious (Bing)
Still keep it real if you will, and manifest through your skills
Not by how many shells you peel

[Verse 3: Pras]
I'ma bring down the ruckus, play the nutcracker
Ruffneck rednecks, makes me no bother
Time after time, ask Cyndi Lauper (Time after time)
Boss, you don't want to fuck with my partners
Motion, commotion, what's your proposal?
Uphold two-fold, the crew is disposal
Like utensil, floss like dental
I autograph my lyrics with a number two pencil

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
(You rocking loud but you ain't sayin' nothin')
It's time I settle the score
(Oba-observing the hypocrites)
(They smile in my face, then they talk behind my back)
Soldiers
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right (It's time I settle the score)
Left, right, left, right, left, left, left, left (It's time I settle the score)

[Verse 4: Lauryn Hill & Wyclef]
Yeah, I'm the L, won't you pull it? (Pull it)
Straight to the head with the speed of a bullet (Bullet)
Cuttin' niggas off at the meeky-freaky gullet
Lyrical sedative, keep niggas medative
Head rushers, I give to creative kids and fiends
Dreams of euphoria, aurora
To another galaxy, phallic see, be this microphone
But get lifted, lyrically, I'm gifted
Burn on it without the roach clip, it hinders, mind bender
Pleasure sender so frequently your nerve endings belong to me
Wrongfully, you put me down not receiving the full capacity of my smoke
Wack niggas choke from the fumes that I emote
Or emit shit
See, even I feel the mahogany
L, natural hallucinogen turning boys to men again
With estrogen dreams, release blues, yellows and greens
From Brownsville to Queens

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
(You rocking loud but you ain't sayin' nothin')
It's time I settle the score
(Ready or not, Refugees taking over)
('Cause we soft-spoken doesn't mean that we've forgotten)
(Now we're permanent at one)
(And one day you will be gotten)
Soldiers
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right (It's time I settle the score)
Left, right, left, right, left, left, left, left (It's time I settle the score)
Soldiers
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right (It's time I settle the score)
Left, right, left, right, left, left, left, left (It's time I settle the score)

[Verse 5: Diamond D & Lauryn Hill]
(Diamond D)
I creep like a thief, no doubt the man's swift (Swift)
I'm more magnificent than Lee Van Cleef (Cleef)
You stand stiff and got the nerve to let your man riff
(We know where to run)
And start flakin' like dandruff (Come on)
Come on, son, my steelo's tight (Uh-huh)
'Cause by far, I'm the best producer on the mic (Right)
Born to write analytical conceptions
With precision, and leave lyrical incisions (Bing)

[Skit]
All J do is front and lie (Man, you crazy as hell)
Whatever, yo, I'm goin' to get something to drink
You alright? You straight? (Yeah, I'm straight)
I'll be right back
Ayo, LJ, I heard you fuckin' Michelle
Nigga, I been fuckin' Michelle
Michelle Leslie Brown? (Nigga, Michelle Leslie Brown)
From 225th Street?
Nigga, Michelle Leslie Brown from 225th Street
That play ball in the park?
Nigga, Michelle Leslie Brown from 225th Street that play ball in the park
Nigga, I been fuckin' her
What happened? What about her?
This nigga said he fucked Michelle (He said he fucked her)
There go Michelle right there, call her over, yo
Ayo, Michelle, come here for a second, baby (What?)
Come here (Ask her, ask her)
Ayo, you fucked J? (Hell no, ew, what?)
Nigga, not that Michelle Leslie Brown from 225th Street that play ball in the park
The other Michelle Leslie Brown
Nigga, that's the only one
Nigga, how many Michelle's is there?
Nigga, she got a cousin or some shit like that, man, I'm saying though
He's a frontin'-ass nigga on three
One, two, three

[Intro]
One, two, ha, haha, oh-oh

[Chorus]
Warn the town, the beast is loose (Ah-ah)
Word 'em up, y'all
Warn the town, the beast is loose (Ah-ah)
Come on (Word 'em up, y'all)

[Verse 1: Lauryn Hill]
Conflicts with night sticks, illegal sales districts
Hand-picked lunatics, keep poli-trick-cians rich
Heretics push narcotics amidst its risks and frisks
Cool cliques throw bricks, but seldom get targets
Private dicks sell hits like porno flicks do chicks
The 666 cut W.I.C. like Newt Gingrich sucks dick

[Verse 2: Wyclef Jean]
Meanwhile the government brings Star Wars from Glock to glockers
C.O.P. has an APB out on Chewbacca
Mister Mayor, can I say something in yo' honor?
Yesterday in Central Park, they got the jogger (Okay, okay, okay)
Okay, let's get the confusion straight in ghetto Gotham (Mmhmm)
The man behind the mask you thought was Batman's Bill Clinton
Who soon retire, the roof is on fire
Connie Chung brung the bomb as it comes from Oklahoma (I'm just sayin')
Things are getting serious, Kuumbaya (My Lord)
On a mountain Satan offered me Manhattan, help me Jah-Jah
(Word 'em up)
(I can't sleep at night)
You can't search me without probable cause
Or that proper ammunition they call reasonable suspicion
Listen, I'll bring friction to your whole jurisdiction
You planted seeds in my seat when I wasn't lookin'
Now you ask me for my license, registration
Where the fuck do I work?
What the fuck is my occupation?
Well, I'm an MC, I'm down with the Fugees
Mother Mary caught a flashback like Rodney
Now the cops got Lolly

[Verse 3: Lauryn Hill]
The subconscious psychology that you use against me
If I lose control, will send me to the penitentiary
Such as Alcatraz or shot up like El-Hajj Malik Shabazz
High class get bypassed while my ass gets harassed (Bang)
And the fuzz treat bruhs like they manhood never was
And if you too powerful, you get bugged
Like Peter Tosh and Marley was (Yeah)
And my word does nothing against the Feds
So my eyes stay red as I chase crazy bald heads, word up (Ah)

[Chorus]
Warn the town, the beast is loose (Ah-ah)
Word 'em up, y'all
Warn the town, the beast is loose (Ah-ah)

[Verse 4: Wyclef Jean]
The chase is on, I feel like the bad guy
Fifth gear, 125 like New Jersey Drive (By)
Looked in my rear view mirror (Yeah)
Police was getting closer (Closer)
Heard a roar in the sky, looked up and saw the Blue Thunder (Shit)
My inner conscious says throw your handkerchief and surrender
But to who? The star spangled banner?
Oh, say can't you see cops more crooked than we
By the dawn early night, robbin' niggas for keys
Easy, low-key crooked military
Pay taxes up my ass, but they still harass me

[Verse 5: Pras]
The streets of corruption got me bustin and cussin' in the concrete jungle
Thoughts being dribbled like that tall kid Mutumbo
Handled by Hannibal
Suitable to be a fugitive like Dr. Kimble
(Ayo, should I slow down now?) Nah, kid, go faster (Why?)
Just 'cause they got a badge, they could still be impostors
Probable cause, got flaws like dirty drawers
Meet me at the corner store so we can start the street wars (Ah)

[Chorus]
Word em up, ya'll
Warn the town, the beast is loose (Ah-ah)
I can't sleep at night, ah (Warn the town)
Thoughts of the beast comin' to get me (Warn the town)
Project Heads, Refugee Camp
Yeah, watch out for gestapo

[Skit]
Yo, let's go to this next Chinese-Muslim joint
We could get some shrimp fried rice and make Salah at the same time
A'ight, cool
"You are not alone"
Ayo, ayo, Chang Wang, what's up?
I'll be right out
Right, right, one second
Okay, then, fine, your order
Alright, let me get, um
Let me get two of them beef fried rices over there
Let me get a half a chicken wing
Don't put that little, that little retarded leg in it 'cause (Right)
Cut, cut that off (Okay then)
Don't put no onions in my, in my white rice
Yo, yo, yo, I need four chicken wings fried hard and shit
What's this? Hold on? What's this?
The two of you? At once?
Okay, then, you want beef
No, no, we want beef to eat, we ain't got no beef
I want four chicken wings fried hard, nigga (Fine)
What the fuck is you talking 'bout?
Alright, I'll kick your monkey asses my fucking self
Woah, woah, what are you coming over the counter for, man?
Listen to me, you think I open a restaurant
In the middle of the hood and don't know what's going on? (Nigga, I'll)
I fucking represent (I'll fuck you the fuck up)
I will avenge my brothers by representing and whooping your ass, word is bond
Nigga, this ain't Channel 5, nigga (Okay then)
Somebody gonna die for real
I must show you Flying Fist of Judah (You ain't gonna show me shit)
That's right (I'ma show you these nuts)
You and you (Straight from Mortal Kombat)
You're just talking, obviously the two of you are just bitch-ass niggas
Nigga, well let's do something then, you talking this old bullshit
What's up? So what's up? (Okay then)
What's up, nigga? What's up, punk-ass?
Alright, this is a Chinese restaurant
But like Burger King, have it your way
Ah! Ah! This nigga here...

[Intro: Wyclef Jean]
Have you ever worn the mask? Yeah
One-two, one-two

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean, Lauryn Hill & Both]
M to the A to the S to the K
Put the mask 'pon me face just to make the next day
Feds be hawking me, jokers be stalking me
I walk the streets and camouflage my identity
My posse in the Brooklyn wear the mask
My crew in the Jersey wear the mask
Stick up kids doing boogie woogie wear the mask
Yeah, everybody wear the mask, but how long will it last? (Yo, yo)

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
I used to work at Burger King, a king taking orders
Punching my clock, now I'm wanted by the manager
Souping me up, saying, "You're a good worker
How would you like a quarter raise, move up to the register?
Large in charge, but ya gotta be a spy
Come back and tell me who's bagging my fries
Gettin' high on company time"
Hell no, siree, wrong MC (Wrong MC)
Why should I be a spy when you're spying me?
And you see what ya thought ya saw but never seen (Bing)
Ya missed ya last move, checkmate, crown me king
Pulled my .22, pistol-whipped him in his face
Hired, now I'm fired, sober, now I'm wired
Eyes pitch red but the beat bop my head
Hit the streets for relief, I bumped into feds (Oh my God)
I got kidnapped, they took me to D.C
Had me workin' underground, building missiles for World War III

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean, Lauryn Hill & Both]
M to the A to the S to the K
Put the mask 'pon me face just to make the next day
Brothers be gaming, ladies be claiming
I walk the streets and camouflage my identity
My posse Uptown wear the mask
My crew in the Queens wear the mask
Stick up kids with the Tommy Hil' wear the mask
Yeah, everybody wear the mask, but how long will it last?

[Verse 2: Lauryn Hill]
I thought he was the wonder and I was stun-gunned by his lips
Taking sips of an Amaretto Sour with a twist
Shook my hips to the bassline, this joker grabbed my waistline
Puttin' pressure on my spine tryna get L-Boog to wind (Bing)
I backed up off him, then I caught him with five fingers to his face
I had to put him in his place, this kid's invadin' my space
But then I recognized the smile, but I couldn't place the style
So many fronts in his mouth, I thought he was the Golden Child
Then it hit me, that's Tariq from off the street around my grams
I haven't seen him since fifteen when he got booked for doing scams
I tried to walk away, but he wouldn't let me leave
He ran up quick behind me asking, "Yo, what happened to my nigga Steve?"
Steve was like this kid I went with back in grammar school
I chuckled, knucklehead, I seen him yesterday, he's cool
Busted, "So who you checking for now? Probably some intellectual"
I kept the conversation straight, but he kept tryna make it sexual
Then his old lady tried to play me, waved her hands up in my face
Yo, I told her, "Check your man, 'cause bitch, you acting out of place" (Come on)

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean, Lauryn Hill & Both]
M to the A to the S to the K
Put the mask 'pon me face just to make the next day
Brothers be frontin', then they be runnin'
I walk the streets and camouflage my identity
My posse in the Bronx wear the mask
My crew on the Isle wear the mask
Stick up kids rolling in the Omni wear the mask
Yeah, everybody wear the mask, but how long will it last?

[Verse 3: Pras]
Three a.m. in the morning on the boulevard
I'm still at large, engaged with my entourage
Me and Godfather and a '67 Dodge
I stepped out then looked, then post up my guard
Searching for my car that was stolen from Scotland Yard (Puerto Ricans got the car)
My first instinct was to check the chop shop garage
As I rung the bell, someone tapped me on my back
I turned around to look, it was a rookie in a mask (What?)
He said, "I got a itchin' on my trigger
Don't move, nigga, I'm taking you for murder"
See cops, got two faces like two laces on my Reeboks
My knees knock as I step back for a clear shot
(Well, did you shoot him?)
Nah, kid, I didn't have the balls
That's when I realized I'm bumpin' too much Biggie Smalls

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean, Lauryn Hill & Both]
M to the A to the S to the K
Put the mask 'pon me face just to make the next day
Runners be beefin', cops be thiefin'
Brothers be scheming, they should be teaming
Jokers be smoking and staying broken
Bitches be teasing, their money skeezin'
Niggas be creeping, baby mothers be weeping
I walk the street and camouflage my identity
My posse in the Haiti wear the mask
My crew in Jamaica wear the mask
Stick up kids bumping "Fu-Gee-La" wear the mask
Yeah, everybody wear the mask, but how long will it last?
Said
(M to the A to the S to the K)

[Outro]
Yo, man, we just rolled up there, shit was ill, man, it was ill
Yo, bullets everywhere, guns, smoke
Jokers fallin' off they porches just shootin', straight cowboys, man
Straight motherfuckin' cowboys

[Intro: Wyclef Jean]
(Before I manifest the rhyme)
Wyclef, Preacher's Son
(Before I manifest the rhyme)
Prazwell (Come on as we bug out)
(Before I man-man-manifest the rhyme)
I used to go to church
(Before-fore-fore I man-man-man-man)
L Boogie, drive the hearse (Manifest the rhyme)

[Verse 1: Wyclef Jean]
I woke up this morning, I was feeling kind of high
It was me, Jesus Christ, and Haile Selassie
Selassie said, "Greetings in the name of the Most High
Jah Rastafari"
Christ took a sip of the Amaretto
Passed it down the table, said, "Today I'll be betrayed by one of you 12 Disciples"
Give me a clue, who could do this to you?
The kid on the block who make less money than you (Calm down)
Crooked cops pulled up, they offered him thirty pieces of silver
All he got to do is deliver the Savior
Right on Bergen Street from bad luck to good luck
My cup runneth over, pass it down, guzzle up
The time have arrived, the prophecy will manifest
I saw death, I got scared, butterflies on my chest
Father, if possible, pass this cup before me
Yo, it's too late, I chose my destiny in Gethsemane

[Chorus]
(Before I manifest the rhyme)
(I'm-I'm man-manifesting)
(Before I manifest the rhyme)
(I'm manifesting)

[Verse 2: Lauryn Hill]
You see I loved hard once (Once), but the love wasn't returned
I found out the man I'd die for, he wasn't even concerned
In time, it turned, he tried to burn me like a perm
Though my eyes saw the deception, my heart wouldn't let me learn
From, um, some dumb woman was I
And every time he'd lie, he would cry, and inside I'd die
My heart must have died a thousand deaths
Compared myself to Toni Braxton, thought I'd never catch my breath
Nothing left, he stole the heart beating from my chest
I tried to call the cops, that type of thief, they can't arrest
Pain suppressed will lead to cardiac arrest
Diamonds deserve diamonds, but he convinced me I was worthless
When my peoples would protest
I told them mind they business, 'cause my shit was complex
More than just the sex
I was blessed, but couldn't feel it like when I was caressed
I'd spend nights clutching my breast, overwhelmed by God's test
I was God's best, contemplatin' death with a Gillette
But no man is ever worth the paradise, manifest

[Chorus]
(Before I manifest the rhyme)
(I'm-I'm man-manifesting)
(Before I manifest the rhyme)
(I'm manifesting)
(Before I manifest the rhyme)
(I'm man-manifesting)
(Before I manifest the rhyme, rhyme, rhyme, rhyme) Prazwell

[Verse 3: Pras & Wyclef Jean]
Gun clap, shell cap, got them crawling on they backs (Facts)
Come through with the Fu, they be, "Who the fuck is that?"
It's unpredictable when my tongue performs Jiu-Jitsu
Cut you with my lyrics, stab you with my pencil (Come on)
Lethal injection, witness protection
Refugee camps under investigation
Gunshot bursts in all directions
For the wack MC's, we read your revelations (Uh-huh)
Discharge through your pores, get raw and kill boars
I can Capleton when I'm on a tour
Some manifest with slugs in they chest
God bless all the cowboys in the Wild Wild West

[Chorus]
(Before I manifest the rhyme)
(I'm-I'm man-manifesting)
(Before I manifest the rhyme)
(I'm manifesting)
(Before I manifest the rhyme)
(I'm man-manifesting)
(Before I manifest the rhyme, rhyme, rhyme, rhyme)

[Skit]
Yo, my whole life was spent looking at myself through the eyes of a motherfucker that hate me
(So what, man?)
Drugged up most of the time
I remember one time I was so fucking high, man
I just got finished drinking, I came home, started sniffin'
I just got up and fell the fuck out, yo
Instead of my brother helping me up, he just start straight kicking me in the bathroom
"Yo, get up, get up, get up
Mom's goin' get us, yo, get up" (Yo, what the fuck?)
I wake up in the morning, man, laying in my throw up and shit all over my nose, man
You know what I realized? It's easy to kill niggas, man
It's easy to kill niggas 'cause they look like you
They smell like you
Shit, they even live on your same motherfuckin' block
The only problem we have is killin' the people who don't look like us
Who oppress us, shit (How you gon' do that?)
Ayy, if you wanna impress me, shoot the motherfucker who turned off my lights (True that, true that)
You want to impress me, shoot somebody who making my bills high all of the time
See, it's easy for cats to kill other cats, it's just the dogs they got trouble with
You know what I'm sayin'?
It's time for us to stand up like men and women, yo
Word up, we gotta stand up and do something about this
You know why?
You let a motherfucker kick you five times, they gon' kick you five times (True)
You let 'em kick you three times, they gon' kick you three times
You let 'em kick you twice, they gon' kick you twice
(I wouldn't let that nigga kick me once, you know what I'm sayin'?)
You let 'em kick you once, they gon' kick you once
But if you break off the motherfuckin' feet
Ain't gon' be no more kicking goin' on, kid (Oh, shit)
Ain't no more kickin'
I learned that shit growing up in Newark, man, the Brick City

Leviticus, oh!
Deuteronomy!

[Verse: Roots Manuva]
Snatch a piece of my wonderin', distant-far like yonderin'
Skin of my tooth like, skin of my boot like
Fly in my soup like, "Where's the waitress?"
Can I take this? Really, can I finish this?
These airs and all these graces
It's my mistake, I'll make it
J-dub to the boom, now make it
Bounce, wiggle, bounce, wiggle, shakin' all them bangs out
Chemical cutthroats, bound to blow the brain out
Cut to the brain, this ain't no game
I'll show no shame, I'll birth this blame
I'm twisted Cain, I'll twist again
I'll push the blade, as plain as day
Known to what these sayers say, known to what these doers do
It's you and who and you-know-where, we's about to take it there
We's about to make it clear, we happy on we lonesome
The long jump, the beat heart, it's start to finish
Ten spoons of spinach, the soul and the spillage
The cup that runneth over, return of the ogre!

[Chorus: 2-D]
All alone (All alone)
All alone (All alone)
All alone (All alone)
All alone (All alone)

[Bridge: Martina Topley-Bird]
Close your eyes and see
When there ain't no light
All you'll ever be, come and save the night
'Cause I don't believe
When the morning comes, it doesn't
Seem to say an awful lot to me

[Chorus: 2-D]
All alone (All alone)
All alone (All alone)
All alone (All alone)
All alone (All alone)
All alone (All alone)
All alone (All alone)

[Verse 1: 2-D]
City's breaking down on a camel's back
They just have to go, 'cause they don't know wack
So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
And you won't get out the county 'cause you're damned and free
You got a new horizon, its ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they've got to kiss me 'cause I don't get to sleep, no
(*beep*)

[Chorus: 2-D]
Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever, hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking, falling down
Love forever, love is free
Let's turn forever, you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

[Verse 2: Trugoy the Dove]
Laughin' gas, these hazmats, fast cats
Linin' 'em up like ass cracks
Play these ponies at the track
It's my chocolate attack
Shit, I'm steppin' in the heart of this here (Yeah)
Care Bear repping in harder this year (Yeah)
Watch me as I gravitate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Yo, we gon' ghost town this Motown
With yo' sound, you in the blink
Gon' bite the dust, can't fight with us
With yo' sound, you kill the Inc
So don't stop, get it, get it (Get it)

[Verse 1: Dennis Hopper]
Once upon a time at the foot of a great mountain
There was a town where the people known as Happyfolk lived
Their very existence a mystery to the rest of the world
Obscured as it was by great clouds
Here, they played out their peaceful lives
Innocent of the litany of excess and violence
That was growing in the world below
To live in harmony with the spirit of the mountain called Monkey was enough
Then one day, Strangefolk arrived in the town
They came in camouflage, hidden behind dark glasses
But no one noticed them, they only saw shadows
You see, without the Truth of the Eyes, the Happyfolk were blind

[Interlude: 2D]
Falling out of aeroplanes and hiding out in holes
Waiting for the sunset to come, people going home
Jump back from behind them and shoot them in the head
Now everybody dancing, the dance of the dead
The dance of the dead, the dance of the dead

[Verse 2: Dennis Hopper]
In time, the Strangefolk found their way into the higher reaches of the mountain
And it was there that they found the caves of unimaginable sincerity and beauty
By chance, they stumbled upon the place where all good souls come to rest
The Strangefolk, they coveted the jewels in these caves above all things
And soon they began to mine the mountain
Its rich seam, fueling the chaos of their own world
Meanwhile, down in the town, the Happyfolk slept restlessly
Their dreams invaded by shadowy figures digging away at their souls
Every day, people would wake and stare at the mountain
Why was it bringing darkness into their lives?
And as the Strangefolk mined deeper and deeper into the mountain, holes began to appear
Bringing with them a cold and bitter wind that chilled the very soul of the Monkey
For the first time, the Happyfolk felt fearful
For they knew that soon the Monkey would stir from its deep sleep
And then came a sound, distant at first, it grew into castrophany
So immense that it could be heard far away in space
There were no screams, there was no time
The mountain called Monkey had spoken
There was only fire, and then... nothing

[Outro: 2D]
Oh, little town in the USA, your time has come to see
There's nothing you believe you want
But where were you when it all came down on me?
Did you call me? No

[Verse 1: 2-D]
The world is spinning too fast
I'm buying lead Nike shoes
To keep myself tethered
To the days I've tried to lose
My mama said to slow down
You must make your own shoes
Stop dancing to the music
Of Gorillaz in a happy mood

[Pre-Chorus: 2-D]
Keeping my groove on
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
Yeah, yeah
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump

[Chorus: Noodle]
Here you go! Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine

[Verse 2: 2-D]
There's a monkey in the jungle
Watching a vapor trail
Caught up in the conflict
Between its brain and its tail
And if time's elimination
Then we got nothing to lose
Please repeat the message
It's the music that we choose

[Pre-Chorus: 2-D]
Keeping my groove on
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
Yeah, yeah
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump

[Interlude]
Okay, bring it down here
We goin' back out

[Chorus: Noodle]
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine

[Outro: 2-D]
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump

[Verse 1: Life]
You couldn't escape this music even if your name's Houdini
Our tracks say Lah for Life and don't disappear like a genie
Communicating through your airwaves like a giant C.B
Cause this one's for your radios over, do you receive me?
Our music is so hot, it feels like the sun in Tahiti
We rickety-rock, Gorillaz style is buck wild, believe me
We heavyweights who phase ya like Ali did with Frasier
We spit the most flava but musically, we'll amaze ya
We've been blessed and we've been gifted like Jesus in his manger
Won't you shout 'Hallelujah!' Here comes your music saviour
From your heart to your mind, your spirits to your souls
We've come to take control with the Gorillaz on patrol
See, our rhymes possess the powers of a superhero
Supernaturally we rock the mic but wit' a natural flow
If you didn't know before, you know now - We told you so
Gorillaz rock your dome just like the one in Tokyo

[Chorus: 2-D]
It's a hard dream to contemplate
I could fall into the abyss-ah
And I love this interlude
It's the reason to deliver
And they called onto me
Says they came to talk to me though
The more of us that lies
I guess the kids don't live or die

[Verse 2: Si Phili]
Cause we're makin' this music that's making you lose it
So people don't abuse it and there ain't no way for you to refuse it
Gorillaz be the army that's startin' this pardy-ardy
Makin' more noise than carnivals mixed with the Mardi-Gradi
We're comin' through your town with the sound that's so profound
Gorillaz with the rappers that straight from the underground
We're tearin' it down, makin' you feel this sort of force
Knockin' you to your senses and knockin' you off your course
Cause we're the source, got you feeling that's so appealing
We got you jumpin' around and bouncin' off of the ceiling
Makin' music ya feeling from Baltimore into Bristol
I know you're hearin' me cause my voice is clearer than crystal
The casual, supernatural flows I be exposin'
Makin' sure that you're frozen and makin' sure that I'm chosen
To rip a score, makin' you damage the dance floor
Gorillaz and Phi Life'll give you what you ask for

[Chorus: 2-D]
It's a hard dream to contemplate
I could fall into the abyss-ah
And I love this interlude
It's the reason to deliver
And they called onto me
Says they came to talk to me though
The more of us that lies
I guess the kids don't live or die

[Verse 3: Life & Si Phili]
Let Gorillaz be your guiding light and your shining star
Whether you be home alone or drivin' in your car
Don't matter who ya are, whether you be near or far
You'll be feelin' entertained be our music repertoire
See, our poems, they be flowin' like rivers and resevoirs
Cause Gorillaz, we be out of this world like men of Mars
We rap stars with supernatural spars
We leave your brains amazed with this super music of ours
So put your hands up and stand up - It's time to get down
Cause Gorillaz and Phi Life, we be breakin' you 'round
From the right to the left, from the skies to the ground
We're coverin' all angles and you can't escape the sound
On the track, it's laid back - We've come to spray raps
Keep it chilled and relaxed but we still sound phat
It's like that when we write raps
We're not from the Empire but we still Strike Back!

I'm posted on the block, my girls take control

I'm lookin like a star, ice on my neck
Ice on my wrist, ice on my chest
You might want to flirt, but I ain't on that
I'm way fucked up, I'm way to' back
And I don't give a fuck, I got it like that
They took a nigga deuce, I got it right back
And now they like "Damn!" Now they like "Amazin!"
Tondra rolled four, five blunts and we blazin
Look at shawty gazin, he lookin like he want me
I'm sorry lil' daddy, I'm tryin to get your homie

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
(Lames can't call her) Lames cain't call her

Hey little darlin, how you shawty?

Niggas play crazy, get left stanky

[Chorus]

[Shawnna]
Yo, yo, ay, Shawnna

Or posted in the parkin lot sittin on the 'llac
Them bitches got weight, them bitches got work
Them bitches wanna trip, them bitches gettin murked
And stick 'em in the dirt, and go on 'bout our bid'ness
And it ain't nuttin personal it's all about the figures
It's M.O.E., 'til a bitch a dead
And I don't give a fuck about what a bitch said
I'm still gettin money, I'm still gettin rich
I'm still that woman that'll take yo' dick
And yeah the truth hurts, you still gotta face it
I spent your whole deal on my ring and my bracelet
It's top notch twat, cream of the crop
I'm beatin down your block and let them choppers chop
Chop, chop, chop, chop... {*fades*}

Gucci got skreet thugs, more than Cleveland
Million on my ice, did it just to make a statement
Five hundred dollar tip, left it with the waitress
Shawty say she like me, really love my bracelet
Like my liquor white, so you know I ain't racist
The other night to shine, I bought the multicolor Jacob
I don't do the push up, but I do the cook up
Chinnin' on these niggas so I think I need a pull up
Blue diamonds blind you every time I dig a booger

Ballin' in the club, drunker than a sailor
Double shot of juice got me standin' on the table

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Twenty thousand dollar frames and they custom made
Clear diamonds on them thangs so it's hard to say
Got a girl at the blaze, snort a ounce a day
She want a Amaretto cocktail but boy get straight
Baby say she want a party, I brought a cake
Told her clean the plate, she can't feel her face
In the club, you can spot us from a mile away
Diamonds in the rain look like Alize
Diamonds in my chain look like Ocean Spray
And the stones ain't cloudy, I make it rain
I got my girl comin' in on a private plane
Soon as she touch down, I make her do it again
In the club Gucci Mane doin' doin' the dance
G5 yeah bitch, that's a hell of a plan
Yeah, suicide doors so we killin' them bitch
Used to play the cards they dealt but now I'm dealin' the bitch

[Bridge: Trey Songz]

Bitches love me they niggas hate me, I know why {*3X*}
Twenty-fours on the Chevy, look like I'm 'bout to fly

[Gucci Mane]
Take flight on a ho, ride a kite on a bitch
Lear jet Gucci, when I ride on 6's
Gotta sit high, like my ride on switches
Rent it out the ass dudes barking hoes keep looking
Shackles wanna jet, but they don't keep bak
Candy coated 'llac, with the brat pushed back
Shorty smoke thrax, what'chu know 'bout that?
Let the top back, the hood catch contact
It's a known fact, Gucci smoke on purp'
Old school verty, with the ace on the skirts
See the tucked dash, paint look like glass
I came through skatin, and they done start hatin
Twenty-eight D-U-B's on rotate
These haters roll dank, I tell 'em get'chu straight
Twenty-eight D-U-B's on rotate
These haters roll dank, I tell 'em get'chu straight

[Hook] - 2X

[Pimp C]
Ya girl nigga she just looove me

See me in the club wanna suck me
Guess that's why you mad and wanna buck me
Tellin them niggas you gon' kill me
But you's a bitch, you gotta feel me
I ride around the ghetto, two hundred thousand on the slab
Spent a million on my jewels and a million on my 'llac
Three million in the bank, fo' million in property
That's nine million dollars and your wife still jockin me
IRS still watchin me they hate niggas with paper
Didn't like me in school, but now the bitch caught +The Vapors+
Like Biz Markie, she got what I need
She thinkin it's the pussy, it's her money and her weeeeeave
I like her head, but I love her bread
Them hoes want a Pimp but them hoes just scared

[Hook] - 2X

[Rich Boy]
I pulled up in the S5, 52 hoes with me
Three thousand dollar Gucci jacket ridin Big Willest
Drinkin deuces and we smokin on some real killer
If you ain't out here gettin then yo' ass silly
Air Willie, nina on my side
I'm sittin so high I don't ride I glide

[Hook] - 2X

In the kitchen cookin chicken tryin to pay my rent, shawty

[Gucci Mane]
Rap about Gucci stay strapped with a uzi
Murder one platinum eatin Justin's by Tuesday
It's Gucci Mane excuse me, dog, I'm makin my music
For facin me a nigga fight about what a toothpick
I did six months, incident with a pool stick
They found a nigga guilty, still say I didn't do shit
Major league, minor league, was independent
I moved on shawty, Gucci handled his business
And I ain't goin back to jail, God is my witness
I'm grillin so hard it look like it's a picnic
So Icy Entertainment and Atlantic
I'm trappin in Spanish, I'm slayin them dragons nigga

[Hook]

[Gucci Mane]
I'm Chef Boyardee, and I'm cookin a QP
I'm whippin up the gravy the fiends say that it's tasty
I'm up 980, soldier scrap like the Navy
It's fuck you pay me, bitch what you done lately
I growed up crazy boy, 1980
A true trap baby bitch the dope game made me
The streets raised me, I drove my kinfolks crazy
Whether blind crippled or crazy, Gucci won't be lazy nigga

[Hook]

[Gucci Mane]
From start to the finish, Gucci Mane the apprentice
So every word, letter, ad-lib, every sentence
Is perfectly place period and indented
I'm trappin' in cursive and rappin' in Chinese
Down South finest, it's Gucci your highness (wow)
Crazy color diamonds they got me shinin (true)
The charts are climbin off a cut like Tyson
I'm big coupe driving but got no license
Lames talk senseless, G's you silence
And you can use peace, dog, but I use violence
I'm trappin like a house over trap house cloudy
And your stones cloudy so you're not ballin
My Down South swag got the fine hoes callin
My swag's on Northern and my grill so 'Nawlins
My Down South swag got the fine hoes callin
My swag's on Northern and my grill so 'Nawlins

[Hook]

And if I linked up to ya, you'd give them the Heisman
Rubbin on ya thighs and I'm lookin in ya eyes and

Chamillion painted old school means it's changin hues
Murder charge, gun charges, aggravated assault
First day out of jail man I bought the bar
My second day out of jail man I bought the car
Every day of the week, I fuckin did a Ferrari
Gotta take every girl to a different mall
Southern Catholic, Fifth Plaza, man I love to ball
Cake boy, cake girls, man I love 'em all
Got forty thousand dollars in my Gucci drawers, pussy~!
And I ain't even re'd up yet

Jump the line e'ry time, you know we jump the line
Fresh up off the grind and we fin' to jump the line

[Gucci Mane]
Gucci Mane is my name, Gucci's what they call me
Six months I lost it, now I'm back to ballin
Twenty-eight inches got me standin really tall man
Tearin up the mall, this is just the way I ball man
Cocaine ounces, blue and yellow wristband
Chain look Iceland, watch by Breitling
Niggas think ice game, Gucci think island
Niggas thank Charger, Gucci think 'rrari
Sorry, Murcielago, I park it
Inside peanut butter outside chocolate
Now outside, get it inside ice cream
Diamonds look mustard, S-600

[Hook]

[Gucci Mane]
I'm headed to the club, I'm lookin for a gul
She lookin for a thug like I'm lookin for a plug
A quarter pound of pound, I sold a lot of drugs
I got a lot of slugs, see I really got it up
But I ain't got enough, I'm steady re'in up
I'm blackin out, my auntie house, she said she's had enough
She put at the house, and I'm back in the trap
It made me feel real good when I came back with that sack

[Hook]

[Gucci Mane]
I'm South Beach in Miami, red and white Ferrari
Off-set shinin rims on my oh-seven Aston Martin
Baby got a jaguar but I like Ferarri
Watch by Jacob but my shoes are made by Marlin
Stepped on your boyfriend and didn't say sorry
Looky looky looky, here comes Gucci
Stepped on your boyfriend and didn't say sorry
Looky looky looky, here comes Gucci nigga

I spent my winter in a jail, so I'm ballin all summer
Bad bitches on my tail, hunt me like a bounty hunter
Never shed a tear for me, my momma never had a daughter
Pussy niggas scared of me, see through you like a bottled water
Gucci Manes a bottle popper, 100 bottles open up
Still slangin opium, smoking at the atruim
In summerhill I'm making plays, right there by the stadium
Move work like a gymnasium, yo birds might end up taking them
Women take one look at me, recognize the crook in me
And if I go away they come put money on my books for me

Snitches see my picture tryna point me out the line-up
Now its 70k a show, promoters screamin back the line up
Pay my barber 2-300 just so he can keep my line up
CEO Gucci Bricksquad, bet you wanna sign up
I'm laughin at these rappers, swag dead like a carcass
You a thirsty starving artist, I'm not an artist I'm an arsonist
Trappers hear my voice on it, and they all rejoice on it
I'm Georgia's most anticipated, screaming who you want it with?
Beef you want then beef you get, murk yo friend then plead the fifth
Tear drops on my face, so I sterotype my fuckin self
I'm the last real nigga left, man its suckas everywhere
Never infiltrate my circle, how could you when you a square?
Sittin in the electric chair, life flashing in front me
Thinking back, I'm walking bare foot, hardly nothing to eat
Everyday I promised me, til they come and punish me
I'll keep chasing money skee, and let these hoes keep chasing me

Gucci Mane, Laflare, there's money in the air
It's ballin over here, it's models over there
It's party over there, we ballin over here
It's Gucci Mane, Laflare, this song is out of here
That's what I'm talkin 'bout, I'm gettin guapped out
And I don't swap it out, you better walk it out
Cause if I pull it out, there's nuttin to talk about
That's what I'm talkin 'bout, know what I'm talkin 'bout?
Pedal to the floor, that's what the Porsche about
Chickens in the kitchen, that's what I'm talkin 'bout
And I'll chalk you out, and I'll cross you out
And I'll move you out, that's what I'm talkin 'bout

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Twenty-eight inch rims that's what we talkin 'bout
Million just on our jewels, that's what we talkin 'bout
Birthday cake for the crew, that's what we talkin 'bout
You either cash it in, or we'll cash you out

[Gucci Mane]
Girl we'll get you drunk, and then we'll dog you out
Kick you to the curb, that's what the boss about
Know what I'm talkin 'bout? On some twenty-eights
That's what I'm talkin 'bout, it's sittin so high
I don't see the traffic, but I can see the sky
I just get the cake, but I don't see the pie
Walk through the club, we don't see the lines
They don't pat us down, so they don't see the nines
Where I party at, you know I'm keepin mine
You know I'm sneakin mine, gotta keep in mind
Know what I'm talkin 'bout? Know what I'm talkin 'bout?
What'cha talkin 'bout - So Icy bank account

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
Signed with Atlantic, now I'm makin mills
Bitch I might be, gone off of pills
Paint match the wheels, the chain match the grill
Major record deal, hundred dollar bills
Know what I'm talkin 'bout? You don't know about
Pull up to the bank, and snatch a hundred out
Then smash out, to my shawty house
Let's go shoppin shawty, that's what I'm talkin 'bout

[Chorus]

Order on two, order on white {*3X*}
Especially for tonight, it's some Shawty Redd drums

[Hook One]
Burglar bar door, hard wood floors
Money on the table, I'm in my stash house
Come on cash out, birds in a drought

Then call the dope man and shorty get you a ten
Then, then call him again
Then call the dope man, then call him again

[Gucci Mane]
I'm so gangster and he's so corny
I'm so hood that the hoes get horny
Oh-seven Corvette on off-set shorties
If those the new twenty then order me forty
Gucci Mane rabbit drums made by Shawty
The hood say we what's up like Bart
Ralph Lauren sheets with the Polo cut
'71 Chevelle and it's sittin' on buttons
'76 I-L and it's sittin on Ashantis
The kid straight blunted smokin top notch chronic
A pound of what we smoke cost ninety-five hundred
I smoke it all day back to back, it's nothin
Gucci Mane trick on a bitch, no cuffin
Baby sucked my dick I gave her two clean hundreds
I didn't have a deal niggas thought it wasn't comin
Never spent a rap check yet, no stuntin, it's Gucci

[Hook Two]
Burglar bar door, hard wood floor
Money on the table, I'm in my stash house

Headed up I-10 with a couple of hens
In a bubbled eyed Benz cause I'm gettin it in
Got a a team of kickmen I be sendin them in
Kickin do's off the hinges tryin to cop by the ten
If a nigga touch a hair on my chiny chin chin
On my chinchilla trench, then we spendin a Ben
Got a Russian armor handgun it's my best friend
Shawty Redd in the Bentley, Gucci Mane in the Benz
Drop a baby in the pot, it do what it does!
When I pull it out the pot, I'mma serve it to cuz
Heavy wrist activity that started my buzz
White diamonds in the Bart look like lil' light bulbs
It's Gucci

Two facts about me, bitch ask about me
Big Cat's around me, keep stacks around
Baguettes around me, the thrax around me
Purple packs around me, no sacks around me
I smoke like Marley, my niggas ride Harleys
I hurt ya daughter feelings Miss Jackson I'm sorry
I'm pimpin like Goldie, and ballin like Kobe
These haters get found floatin in the ocean for no fee
Your bitch she choose me, you mad she choose me
I'm glad she chose me, she gave me her do' key
Did time on White Street, did time in D.C
Gucci the O.G., they put me on TV
I'm gutter like B.G., I'm reppin the B.C
The jealous ones envy, got somethin against me

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
You fuck with him, you fuck with me
You fuck with them, you stuck with me
Big Cat, Laflare, we don't fight fair
Big Cat, Laflare nah we don't fight fair

[Gucci Mane]
Got major flavor, no major label
We major niggas cause we got major paper
Ball hard like we Major League Baseball players
Who is Shirley Franklin cause Gucci Mane's the mayor
I run the city uhh, I am the city
Bad Boy but I never did sign with Diddy
I bake the cake, I make the cake
Thirty-six what I cop like Jacob plate
My team the champs, yo' team the chumps
My squads the Spurs hell your squad the punks
I load the pump, unload the pump
Explode the pump then reload the pump
Big wheel in the trunk, you fit in the trunk
You sit in the trunk 'til you stank like a skunk
The city of thieves, drug dealers and G's
My niggas they gamble, all my niggas smoke weed

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
My money got a mouth so I let it talk for me
Half a mill' worth of ice what it bought for me
I'm on that bubble kush man that's a rich high
I order Crist' by the case, I'm a rich guy
I'm 25 but I ride like I'm 67
Plus when I ride man I ride with a Mac-11
A quarter pound worth of purple thrax to smoke on
So iced out man I think I need my coat on
The young nigga with the shades and the gold fronts
Why you stunt so hard? You only live once
I'm in the club real high and I'm real drunk
I'm on my third bar tonight and I'm on my eighth blunt
I'm leavin with your girl plus I'm parked right in the front
Ride on them 28's but we call 'em Warrick Dunns
I'm from East Atlanta man this is how it's done
We rock them old school verse under the Georgia sun

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
Your boy Gucci Mane speakin
Yeah I'm home, just touched down
I'm addressing all these blow pops out there
YUH!!

[Hook: repeat 2X]
A blow pop, that's a straight up buster
I call 'em blow pops cause they big old suckers

[Gucci Mane]
I'm lookin at the world through my iced out gaze
You couldn't walk a mile in my brand new J's
... If you know what I mean
I keep courtside seats like I play for the team
... I'm killin myself
Hold my dick when I rap cause I'm feelin maself
... Real talk youse a blow pop
Got out of jail, now your whole show stop
... Youse a blow pop homie
I'm independent ballin major, you get no props homie
Six months was a pit stop
And I ain't got time to be fuckin with no blow pops

[Hook] - 2X

[Gucci Mane]
To hate on Gucci Mane that's a blow pop move
You gotta wear 20's just to fill my shoes
... See I ain't fuckin with blow pops
You let him in ya clique and now you stuck with a blow pop
You thought he was a G, he turned out to a blow pop
You bought his cd, now you know he's a blow pop
... Some blow pops tried to kill me
Somebody set me up so tell me how am I guilty?
But I don't need no one else
Cause any time I get a beep I just call myself
Cause youse

[Hook] - 2X

[Gucci Mane]
Big Cat Records play rough, what de blood claat?
Gucci on the mic talkin 'bout all these blow pops
... Man they softer than fat back
Hundred fifty grand for the chain can you match that?
... Man you straight up fake
And if I see you in the street probably spit in your face
... The rap game so sleazy
They tried to knock me off but ay it ain't that easy
Them blow pops all wanna blow up
Mad cause my watch cost the same as a Porsche truck
... Got locked tryin to ho hop
But that's what I get man for fuckin with blow pops

[Hook] - 2X

Gucci Mane, Big Cat

[Gucci Mane]
Growin up was real hard on my block
Cops and robbers I was never the cop
To be the cop was considered a joke
I'm the same lil' nigga taught your brother to smoke
But now-a-days man I stay on the news
My every move airs up on the tube
Whoever said bein a gangster was easy
I got beef with BMF and I got problems with Jeezy
To be a gangster is a full time job
A Bad Boy but I ain't Black Rob
The pay's good but the hours are crazy
You disrespect me I'mma send ya to Grady
I'm never scared but I'm thinkin ahead
Because they don't bury the scared man, they bury the dead
An ex-con but I'm out on bond
Wave bye to the bad guys, Teflon Don

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Got my name in the paper and my face on the news
Gucci Mane, Laflare, e'rybody, e'rybody know me
E'rybody know me
Nigga Gucci Mane, Laflare, I'm a real O.G

[Gucci Mane]
You wanna take it to the street nigga? Let's go there
There ain't nothin 'tween us pussy nigga but air
But you better prepare, 'fore you fuck with Laflare
I'll have you roll around freakin a wheelchair
See I don't fight fair, nah I don't fight fair
Gucci Mane'll put that ass in intensive care
Matter fact if you see me fight a grizzly bear
I suggest that you help the fuckin grizzly bear
Ain't no pussies over here nah it's just G's
Ain't no time for no talk, nigga cock it and squeeze
Got these ho type ass niggas weak at the knees
Shoot 223's that'll chop down trees
Gucci Mane out of jail man, what I'm gon' do now
That Jeezy lil' bitch ass thinkin out loud
Gucci Mane out of jail man, what I'm gon' do now
That Jeezy lil' bitch ass thinkin out loud

[Hook]

[Gucci Mane]
You m'uhfuckers must don't know who they mess with
I'm that outlaw, Wild Wild West shit
I'm on that two clips, AK and a vest shit
You motherfuckers must don't know who you fuckin with
I'm not a kid, Gucci Mane full grown
So bring the choppers, leave the nines at home
And call the coppers cause I'm aimin for domes
I'll have you call a full backup on the phone
The franchise, but Gucci Mane ain't wearin no white tee
You niggas hate the fact that niggas so icy
But fuck that, niggas don't gotta like me
Cause seein niggas shit split it excite me
Picture me high off the weed like a kite be
I took your bitch through my hood just to sightsee
I screen niggas so I stay on that skreet shit
And if there's drama then it's you I'mma deal with

[Hook]

[Intro]
Zaytoven on the track
Zay-tiggy! Gucci, Gucci

They call me Chef Boy RG, but hold that thought
It's a Kodak moment, how I hold that fork
Got a hurricane wrist game tornado turns dog
Pockets Piggly Wiggly, caine Kermit the Frog dawg

[Gucci Mane]
Early in the mornin, I ain't even yawnin
Cookin up a cake, like I'm doin a performance
When it come to flossin, I ain't even talkin
Diamonds on my donk* got my Chevy moonwalkin
Ten bricks on my Bart Simpson, just look
My watch, thirty-five pounds of kush
My ring, thirty-six O's my nig'
My bracelet, five hundred pounds of mid'
A Gucci wrapped tour bus, y'all hoes follow us
Party pack of pills man, hoes gonna swallow us
Naturally a loner, but love my kid
Mix the soda with the cola, I can buy me a friend
New swag somethin like Trap House times 10
E'ry nig' around me bust heads, YA DIG?~!
Iced out grill, I can't buy that bullshit
I'm with some street shit, like the reverend in the pulpit

[Hook]

[Gucci Mane]
Like the boy Rip Ham I got a real good J
One gram for the eighty, that's a real good play
Got them Vince Carter quarters, add soda and water
I'm not athletic, but I'mma straight baller
The Spud Webb ticket, with the Larry Bird yay
And it's jumpin from the free throw like MJ
See my 'Vette pass by, like a Steve Nash pass
Stay loyal like the fans of the Utah Jazz
Like Dr. J shorts, my work real tight
You got that Atlanta Hawks yay, it won't get right
(You cain't get right) Catch me on the rebound, like Bo Outlaw
I'mma Mikey Vick it, whip it, cook it southpaw
Thirty-six ho-zoes, tried to make the endzone
Make a Joe Horn move, and use my cell phone
Always scramblin in the pot, just like Steve Young
Five for the Keyshawn, seven for the Deion

[Hook]

[Gucci Mane]
Gucci on fire like mojo crack pot
Fell over a chump, right back like crack rock
Money stupid dumb, just like Cold Blood
Just like Young Hot, I show no love
Mines is gettin like Cheeba, mines like Fat
And my trap roll hard, just like Shawty Black
I'mma country ass nigga, just like Ace
Gotta fetish, for the stones, just like UGK
My dough like bruh, yours like G
And my patience very short, just like Courtney C

Drop the top on that thang just to let ya hair blow
Let ya hair blow, let ya hair blow

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I drive a sports car bitch, put them Bapes to the gas
If you scared go to church cause I'm fin' ta drive fast
Throwing cash out the brains of a '74 Oldsmo'
Me and ol' mojo, he need to get some mo' dough
Cornerstore, Amoco, Bouldercrest and Flat Shoals
Niggas want that work, lil shawty meet right by Gresham Road
East side up, put them E's in the air
If you smoking bubba kush, put them trees in the air
I'm smoking on that kush so it's stankin up my car
They call me "twinkle twinkle" cause they know that I'm a star
I told her come here then I didn't say shit
Cause my ice talk for me, I don't need no broke bitch

[Chorus: Jason Caesar]
I drive real fast baby I don't drive slow
I don't drive slow, I don't drive slow
Drop the top on that thang just to let ya hair blow
Let ya hair blow, let ya hair blow

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]

Skittle up yo' chain, turn your watch to Starburst too
Put them Lemonheads in yo' ears
Put them Fruity Pebbles on yo' fingers, now you envied by yo' peers
And I'mma get yo' ass in shape
All that Gucci Louis tone got yo' ass losin weight (leanin)
Gucci Mane got you straight, huh?
You know he got that cake, gave it to her first date
I'mma ride down the block like a damn X pill
Standin tall on them sixes like some damn high heels
I'mma roll down the block like a damn X pill
Standin tall on them sixes like some damn high heels

[Chorus: Jason Caesar]
I drive real fast baby I don't drive slow
I don't drive slow, I don't drive slow
Drop the top on that thang just to let ya hair blow
Let ya hair blow, let ya hair blow

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Yeah Rose, red Monkeys wit da Bapes
On some pharaoh shit, bitches feedin a nigga grapes
I'mma buy some hot wings, but I could buy steak
But I'm good with a trap bitch a model too fake
Zaytoven on the beat so you know they gon' hate
Got that Tony Tiger kush, man that shit smoke great
Got that waterboy mentality, I think I can do it
Try me and your body filled with embalming fluid
Trapper slash rapper but a full time G
Smokin purp' with my boys, 'bout two or three P's
I'm a trapper slash rapper but a full time G
Smokin purp' with my boys, 'bout two or three P's

[Chorus: Jason Caesar]
I drive real fast baby I don't drive slow

[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Geah! Wit'cha man La Chat

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Pull up in the old school with the hubcaps
Got my black tee, ones, and my skull cap
Stick 'em up (stick' em up!) {*repeat 3X*}
Stick 'em up (ye ain't know ha?)
I ain't come to play, and I ain't come to laugh
All I gotta say is nigga put it in the bag
Stick 'em up (stick' em up!) {*repeat 3X*}
Stick 'em up (ye ain't know ha?)

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
You know the procedure, when you see a heater
Bullets rippin at'cha, got you runnin like a cheetah
Rob in my black tee, mob in my black V
Robbed the weed man, cause the nigga tried to tax me
Ye ain't gotta ask me, tell me where the stacks be
Hittin big licks got me ballin like an athelete
Used to take Starter coats, moved up to bigger dope
Down for a kick do', just to make my wrist glow
Steal from the rich, but I hang with the po' folk
Ball 'til ya fall, but don't ball 'til ya go broke
Gucci Mane, La Chat, we in and out the trap fast
Leavin out your house, thirty birds in my bookbag

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Pull up in the old school with the hubcaps
Got my black tee, ones, and my skull cap
Stick 'em up (stick' em up!) {*repeat 3X*}

Stick 'em up (stick' em up!) {*repeat 3X*}
Stick 'em up (ye ain't know ha?)

[Verse 2: La Chat]
Okay, check that bitch
Wake up early in the mornin, looking for a victim
The first nigga look like dollars tryin to holla I'm gon' get him
Ain't got no time for relationships, I'm out to get that cheese
Even if I have to kill you bitch my son I got to feed
I'm at the mall I'm poppin tags with shopping bags so style
I found a duck that I can pluck, that nigga that asked me out
Whoa~! Hold up my nigga you must don't know I gotta get'cha
You told yo boy I got a big ass, but boy my nine is bigger
I'm waitin on him to pull up at the spot I see he clean
That boy sittin on them thangs, a iced out chain, and big ass rangs
He said let's go to the movies, I told him let's go to the room
This nigga think he really got a freak, but mind is 'Do the fool'
We get to the room, I let him rub, I let him get a lil' touch
I told him hold up stop, let me go to the bathroom freshen up
I went out the bathroom window, met with Gucci, Glock in purse
Kicked in the do', shot him in his head, took his cheese and left him murked
I'm that bitch!

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Pull up in the old school with the hubcaps
Got my black tee, ones, and my skull cap
Stick 'em up (stick' em up!) {*repeat 3X*}
Stick 'em up (ye ain't know ha?)
I ain't come to play, and I ain't come to laugh
All I gotta say is nigga put it in the bag
Stick 'em up (stick' em up!) {*repeat 3X*}
Stick 'em up (ye ain't know ha?)

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
They say that I'mma cutthroat, Gucci never cut coke
Yea I'mma jack boy, known to run a drug sto'
Hang wit the thug boys, nicknamed the Goon Squad
First you gotta sign up, then you get your goon card
Niggas scared to fuck with me, don't wanna serve me
Shop wit ya Wednesday, take from ya Thursday
Splurge wit my comrades, Gucci Mane I'm hood rich
Nigga kill for ya if you just buy him a outfit
Think like a mob boss, move like warranty
Got a half a mill' safe, just to keep the bills paid
Burn 'em with a hot fork, tazer on his nutsacs
I ain't come to play man I came to find them big stacks

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
Pull up in the old school with the hubcaps
Got my black tee, ones, and my skull cap
Stick 'em up (stick' em up!) {*repeat 3X*}
Stick 'em up (ye ain't know ha?)
I ain't come to play, and I ain't come to laugh
All I gotta say is nigga put it in the bag

Stick 'em up (ye ain't know ha?)

[Intro: Black Magic]
Yeah! It's ya boy Black Magic
My nigga Young Snead, let's go

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Ay man I walk like a soldier, talk like a soldier
Since I moved to the South, my slang got colder
Walk got pimper, cane with the limper
Treat my bitch right, always lobster and shrimp her
Flatbush Ave I'm the number one contender
Simpson Road fashion, poppin wheelies on the Ninja
Whip game hot, flow cold like the winter
Ball hard if niggas got blocks like a center
Time for me to switch it up, bigger car bigger truck
Got the new house and that too was big as fuck
And this a must that you see me blow
Lil' nigga hold the weight like my CEO
Now it's back to the business, we eat sleep and shit this
Take this, shoot him and any fuckin witness
Always on some pimp shit, never on some simp shit
At Big Cat Records nigga e'ryday is Christmas

[Chorus 1: Gucci Mane]
We eat, we sleep, we shit this
Big whips, big chips, we live this
Smoke kush, pop Crist', fuck bitches
Us young niggas out there handle our business

And send them goons if them goons on our shit list

[Chorus 2: Gucci Mane]

Tell them fuck niggas they can miss us with that sucker shit

[Verse 2: Black Magic]
I'm addicted to the trap, down with Big Cat
And you know he got a strap, why you wanna try me?
And you know I gotta scrap, you a country boy
So you know I gotta trap (AYYYY!)
Cop the fruity watch just to hurt the haters' faces
Big Cat chain with the Big Cat bracelet
Big Cat bracelet with the Big Cat bracelet
Countin twenty mill' in the Big Cat basement
I heard, I heard, word on the street
Gucci fell down now he back on his feet
Anti-social, he don't really socialize
What'cha call that? I call it street certified~!
A hundred thou' sold no lie
So call the fire truck, cause Gucci on fire
And he pulled up in a 'rrari
And if he hurt your feelings when he did then he sorry!

[Chorus 2: Gucci Mane]
Guess what I heard? Gucci Mane back
Guess what I heard? Man he reppin Big Cat
Guess what I heard? Young Snead on some other shit
Tell them fuck niggas they can miss us with that sucker shit

[Verse 3: Young Snead]
I'm a certified pimp shawty, never seen me cake a ho
Bad bitch one night, next day another ho
A young'un with a bankroll, listen what I date 'em fo'?
Benefits and everythang that I can go and break 'em fo'
We eat, we sleep, we shit this
Smoke kush, pop Crist', real pimp shit
Big chains, big whips on 6's
I got money on my mind so fuck bitches
I'm in the Coupe with the top back, Lamborghini do's on it
Had to do it B-I-G, so I throwed the 4's on it
Tote a fo'-fo' so the kid scream 'Fuck a hater!'
All black, long part, somethin like The Terminator
Call me the exterminator, sprayin like the Orkin man
You don't want no part of that we deeper than a marching band
We trap, we slang, we hustlers
And stay away from you motherfuckin busters

[Chorus 1: Gucci Mane]
We eat, we sleep, we shit this
Big whips, big chips, we live this

Geah {*echoes*}, Gucci {*echoes*}
Gucci Mane, LaFlare, yeah
(A lot of niggas thought we couldn't have pulled it off Gucci Mane
But, guess what, we here, we sellin units
We doin real big AND we eatin, the whole plate)
The whole fuckin plate man; ain't no cuts on this shit man
Ain't no middleman in this shit, we want all the fuckin money man
We get all the money, independent where it's at man
I'mma tell y'all independents like this
If you want the blueprint to this shit, watch Gucci Mane

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Gucci overdooz it, does it, the boy's perfect
Neck piece flooded, it's color scattered and covered
I'm worth nine hundred God damn I spent a hundred
But that's rap money, when trappin that cash nothin
I'm internet surfin, tourin grillin and turfin
Speedboat racin, jet skiing and golfin
Crazy color Jordans, same color the ballin
Bitch I bet up on it, I'm rich my dear regardless
Shrimp scampi odor every time I flaunt chick
Trap nigga conversate, with a Harvard smart bitch
I'm young rich and heartless, put you on a carton
Cartoon jewelry customized by my artist
Six months locked, got a head start bitch
I was nigga rich befo' I ever got a rap check
Yellow Corvette same color Moet
Paid twenty grand just to get every stone set

[Chorus]
Big black hollow tips that's what the sig spit
Hataz try me they'll get shot in the kidneys (blaow)
Dislodge bullets real fast what a chop' do (blaow)
I'm Gucci Mane, LaFlare, I tote a Glock like a cop do
We don't talk to strangers, we cop bangers
Trappin at night man, it might get dangerous
But I'm from East Atlanta where they cuttin off fangaz
I'm from East Atlanta where they cuttin off fangaz!

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I'm shittin on these rappers like I'm wearin a Pamper
I'm sittin on five hundred cause I got it together
Niggas never try niggas that set examples
I'mma eat a shawty sunnyside or the scramble
The port of Miami, to the streets of my 'lanta
The pinkie with the light stone match your encounter
I'm Gucci Mane, LaFlare, they call me Gucci Montana
I'm Boston, Georgia, Florida, Macon, Tampa and 'Bama
My Mississipi niggas feel me harder than Banner
Haters see my video they switchin the channel
Gucci got pieces, shawty go get'cha camera
And Gucci time is money bitch, so go get it faster
Cause I could give a damn about your father's a pastor
Because I smoke your father then yo' ass is a bastard
Gucci smokin weed, so you know he's a hazard
Money's on my mind, bitches don't really matter

[Chorus]
Big black hollow tips that's what the sig spit
Hataz try me they'll get shot in the kidneys (blaow)
Dislodge bullets real fast what a chop' do (blaow)
I'm Gucci Mane, LaFlare, I tote a Glock like a cop do
We don't talk to strangers, we cop bangers
Trappin at night man, it might get dangerous
But I'm from East Atlanta where they cuttin off fangaz
I'm from East Atlanta where they cuttin off fangaz!

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
My money so big it can't fit in my mattress
Devil bought the actress cause I signed with Atlantic
One fifty cursin while trappin in Spanish
Forty in my pocket turn yo' head to some Manwich
Boss of your boss man, I push the Porsches
My million dollar chain got me feelin important
Jumped off early and copped me a fort
Major moves with money like the +King of New York+
Gucci go and get it while them hoes get abortions
Shittin on a bitch, take a piss on they Jordans
Rappers want promotion, Gucci Mane want the package
The scale in the bag, bitch pay me on the back end
Hamiltons and Washingtons, Franklins and Jacksons
Trapper never trip, I just added the fractions
New bitch waggin, brand new mansion
And everything designer from my jeans to my glasses

[Chorus]
Big black hollow tips that's what the sig spit
Hataz try me they'll get shot in the kidneys (blaow)
Dislodge bullets real fast what a chop' do (blaow)
I'm Gucci Mane, LaFlare, I tote a Glock like a cop do
We don't talk to strangers, we cop bangers
Trappin at night man, it might get dangerous
But I'm from East Atlanta where they cuttin off fangaz
I'm from East Atlanta where they cuttin off fangaz!

[Intro:]

Girl, I'm not stupid, but my knot stupid
Offsets stupids, VVS stupids
Girl, it's Gucci Gucci, and my diamonds fruity

[Verse:]
Seventy on my Jakey baby, color karat bracelet baby
Why not spend about 20 g's, Gucci drop 380 baby
Multi-color clarity, necklaces are heavy mane
Hit the club then leave the club then come back with another chain
Mighty mouse is icey dog, Bart Simpson is just stoopid
Yellow, blue, black, green and white, the diamonds match the groupies
Digitally enhance the stones, pink is like a movie
Truly I'm a walkin lick, Gucci man the talkin brick
If you ain't gon' talk no chickens dog, who you talkin to?
7:30 in the kitchen, Nate Nate 'bout to go to school (Nate Nate)
Saturday I'm cookin chickens, momma about to go to work
Sunday Gucci cookin chickens, granny about to go to church

[Hook:]
See my chain stupid, and my ring stupid

[Verse:]
Heavy wrist activity, got me livin lovely
Cocaina heavily cocaina shawty
Breakin down ten chickens dog, 'bout to cook the shake up
All these extra grams, might as well go buy a Jacob
Gucci Mane for mayor, Gucci Mane so player
Reppin East Atlanta that's ten minutes from Decatur
I must match our cars and our vests gon' match our gators
You can't swang like Gucci cause you don't got enough flavor
Heavy on the licorice, dentistry ridiculous
Bitches I'm magnificent, I'm not very articulate
Gucci what the penalty? Shawty what the business?
Every night is Valentine, every day is Christmas
Gucci what the penalty? Shawty what the business
Every night is Valentine, every day is Christmas

[Hook:]
See my chain stupid, and my ring stupid
Girl I'm not stupid, but my knot stupid

[Verse:]
My girlfriend say she love me, but it's just the jewelry
Multicolor karats got your girlfriend kinda curious
First I drop my verses then I go and drop the chorus
Then I'm out the booth back to my trap, you know on Moreland
'74 restored it, Zaytoven record it
Say you chargin 30 like the Gucci can't afford it
Gucci chargin 40 dog, that's a couple birdies
Gucci stupid jewelry dog, I don't think you heard me

[Hook:]
See my chain stupid, and my ring stupid
Girl I'm not stupid, but my knot stupid
Offsets stupids, VVS stupids

[Intro]
Yup! Yup!
Gucci Mane in this motherfucker (Gucci Gucci)
My nigga Zo' on the track (my nigga Zo')
That real shit, that real shit

[Hook: repeat 2X]
I'm a hood rich nigga, I ain't never had shit
I really ain't shit; niggas talkin 'bout me
But they really ain't shit, they ain't said shit
It don't make dollars, it don't make cents/sense

[Gucci Mane]
I ain't never had shit nigga that's the truth
Rich kids in the school used to jones my shoes
Name stayed on the board, fo' checks in chalk
In detention cause the teacher say that we can't talk
Car so ragged that my momma got that I just walk
I wish I had a nickel for every fight I fought
Stealin candy out the sto' like I can't get caught
Just a lil' bad black boy, it ain't my fault
After school snack syrup and fo' pieces of bread
Granddaddy why yo' eyes so God damn red?
"Got a real soft ass and a hard-ass head
Better mind your fuckin manners boy," that's what he said

[Hook]

[Gucci Mane]
I moved to East Atlanta at the age of 9
Real cold winter, 1989
My brother good at ball, I can't play no sports
They won't let you pack a tool on the b-ball court
Cluster Ave, Monty Paul, where my daddy now?
Things goin alright, we a family now
Got the dopeman Nikes and the Starter coat
Only nigga in school with the dopeman rope
Pull the joint two times, man I'm high already
I like that girl with them braids and them high-top Chevys
Got that bump for stick-up, Starter and the big boy chest
Tried to take it on the train but I just couldn't let him

[Hook]

[Gucci Mane]
14 gettin drunk at a house party
They locked me up, they must have hid a half a ounce on me
Momma mad as a mother', daddy let him be
Gucci Mane, raised me to be a straight up G
Now my daddy hustle hard, but he love sum liquor
And my momma wanna leave him but she love the nigga
Everything kinda changed when I turned 16
Got the old school Regal with the chrome back rings
Like a newborn baby, man that bitch clean
But the motor fucked up and the transmission
And it's knockin down the street with the 415's
In Mackmile parkin lot, stright whipping
And I'm Bankhead bouncin, fo' hoes want me
Hit the half and give me two dimes for 15
And my mind's on gettin rich by all means
In the trap, cause this rap shit was just my dream

[Hook]

[Ox from Belly]
Aiyyo! Y'all hear me? {*sniff, sniff*}
Welcome to Murder City pussy claat {*sniff*}

Magic go to the Ox welcome to Murder City pussy {*sniff*}
An who wan' war? An who wan' war?
COMIN IN!!

[Intro]
{*sound of a fly buzzing around*}
Hot damn! Hot, hot, stankin hot
A steerin wheel charm 'bout the size of a dinner plate

[Hook]
Too many VVS, and when you see you got to say
("Gawwwwd damn! Sheeeeeeit!")
Is your lights on? (Yeah) Iced on (Yeah)
Diamonds on my chest my name right on my wrist my fist
It be like ("Gawwwwd damn!")
All the hoes sayin ("Sheeeeeeit!")
Then the niggas be like diamonds on the chest thick
Wrist, arm, fist, man, Gucci Mane, LaFlare, he the shit

[Gucci Mane]
Gucci Mane in the party, bump whoa Kemosabe
So sick with the words think I need chemotherapy
No simpleton, but this beat, it's a sicken them
Gucci Mane the maestro but you should take a whiff of it
Halloween down to chain, hoes wanna trick or treat
Brother trick it off, 'fore I take yo' bitch out to eat
Buyin chain so foolish, girl I spent a hundred G's
I can trick my brightland then, and, get a hundred G's
Hundred G's ain't nothin to me, I need least two thousand ki's
Where are those two thousand pizzas it been dry out here a week
Laugh not for the kid dawg, twenty thousand for a fee
Ten cars, got a fleet, I done rolled and everything

[Hook]

[Gucci Mane]
See the second verse better so get your air freshener
Wanna be like Gucci? Little buddy eat your vegetables
I'm on another level, I'm Gucci Boosay
Gucci boots were purchased 'fore they came out schedule
Thirty-five thou' just to come to your house
Say happy birthday, ate cake and bounced out
Now Gucci is a drought, whereabout, not in this house
Pills pills powder traphouse like a drug sto'
Never too much, I'm the shit, like the commode
Toilet stool breath ass girl, you need to back up
Shawty so fine she need to slow it up, slow it up
Shawty showin legs but she still ain't seen enough

[Hook]

[Gucci Mane]
Speedy, Gucci
The So Icey boys baby girl, see our diamond watches
All the girls are jockin cause they know, that my diamonds poppin
Floppin, flies around me, cause they know that Gucci's funky
Toppin, and bossin, and save the posses for the runnin
AK-47, is still, what's shakin for me
So Icey squad pussy nigga, we cross the country
See I'm the man, bland pussy nigga we the army
We made a plan, and, and, look we formed a company
So mad, told y'all that we gettin money
Every day they cocky, and dirty laundry
1500, just to clean my garbage
I'm Gucci Mane, LaFlare, I'm from the projects

[Hook]

[Outro]
("Gawwwwd damn! Sheeeeeeit!")

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
I got trap money, I got trap-I got trap

I got 20 for a show, but it's really rap money
20 for a hoe and that's really trap money

[B.A.]

Blue lights flashin, checkin out my mansion
Gangster so flashy, Louis Vuitton magnum
How he out here swaggin? Dat be what they askin
I drop the white crease, call it dope boy magic
Dopeology, you should take one of my classes
Hit me in the hood, red carpet, pants saggin
Rob you on Front Street in 75 classic
My potnahs know I'm good in the hood besides rappin
I got trap money cabin, it's 30 if you askin
D trap money lavish, ain't gotta make it rappin
Fruity bezel the cabbage, them country niggas taxin
Ballin like Maverick, blowin loud in the traffic
I robbed a nigga twosie in some Rap Lord fashion
Say young'n in the hood, I'm a trap money addict
Cartier glasses, you see that I got money
I wake up early in the mornin I need me some trap money

[Chorus]
I got trap money, I got trap-I got trap
I got trap money, I got trap-I got trap
I got 20 for a show, but it's really rap money

I got 20 for a show, but it's really rap money
20 for a hoe and that's really trap money

[Mook]
Mook~!
20 Benz back, you see a nigga, that's my pack money
Look I ain't got no record deal so no it ain't no rap money
You see the stack in my jeans, I can't fit no rubber band
22 on cents, I'ma wrap it 'round them
And first I unload the tractor, bust 'em out the wrapper
Get 'em to my trappers and they bring me back them rat chicks
Bust off goin fast, you can call it cheetah girl
When I get the panky you know I'm water whippin her
No top on the whip, tank top Louis V
You can call me tank top cause all I do is wifebeat
Talkin smart on the phone, price just gone up
Take it or leave it homeboy, either way I give a fuck
Pot cold, LB's, kush by the O-Z's
Yeah I sell 'em for the low and get 'em for the dirt cheap
Get in just how you want, I'm a walkin trap sto'
Well connected nigga courtesy of my amigos
Flyin down 20 East, trunk full of dirty birdies
In the middle of the drought we let them bitches fly for 30
In the kitchen cuttin work I gotta do my two-step
Yeah I'm bad leg trappin, bring it to your front stop
Now I'm on Y-65, just got off I-10
In the handicap van, fill it up with midgets man
I mean the good I know is show and it ain't come from rappin money
Ten bands, all tens, nigga that's my trap money

[Chorus]
I got trap money, I got trap-I got trap
I got trap money, I got trap-I got trap
I got 20 for a show, but it's really rap money
20 for a hoe and that's really trap money
I got trap money, I got trap-I got trap
I got trap money, I got trap-I got trap
I got 20 for a show, but it's really rap money
20 for a hoe and that's really trap money

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Them niggas is gangsters, them niggas is Shady
Them niggas got screws loose, them niggas is crazy
Walk around with they boots loose, tuckin 380's
Standin in the trap screamin fuck you pay me

[Verse One]
Nigga I'm one-seven-five wet, movin like Deebo
Boxcutter like a nigga work at Home Depot
Rep for my people, a big Desert Eagle
Shootin' at your bucket like a Marbury free throw
Bitches get nothin, zilch I mean zero
Tommy gun sprayed at them niggas playin' hero
Niggas in the hood don't peep through no peephole
Cameras and motion scanners, try to creep ho
Most of us iced out, some don't even rock jewels
They in the club for a purpose, and that's to bang the tool
Street smart, I'm far from that college dude
Love gettin good brains, bitches give me knowledge fool
It don't take much, a little weed and the dutch
Couple sips of that Remy, now she wanna fuck
Hoes see a nigga chain swingin wanna touch
Rocks used to be cubed up, now my shit is crushed

[Hook]

[Gucci Mane]
My pack came in, I want seventeen-five for 'em
Bricks go down when you get more than five on 'em
Bck in '98, I was holdin that 'tel down
2006 and now we're breakin them bales down
Gucci you the shit, least that what they told me
Catch me in the 6 a nigga right where the shoals be
I fronted you a nine so five what you owe me
If you don't pay me then it's back to the old me
Cocaína same color the snow be
Haters get found in the Okefenokee
You trap that's cool, I trapped since school
I'm trappin boo, but I'm rappin too
Not a role model, hit that purp
I'm not a role model little shorty rep your turf
I'm not a role model, hit that purp'
I'm not a role model young nigga cook that work

Now this the bad guy song, they put the bad guys on it

Always givin fake names, cars got paper plates
The bad guy, say hello to my little friend (say hello)
My lil' friend got a hundred other lil' friends
Now we the bad team, it's more than a bad dream
Gucci and Black Magic now that's a bad scene
Carbon 15's comin out, AK's comin out
I'ma run the North, Gucci run the South
Independent but we ballin like majors
Them fruity ones got 'em all flavors

Violators haters will be turned to organ donors
Chillin in the V.I., sippin on Corona

Stop playing games girl cause I don't condone 'em
If you want some work don't come before like it's a zone up

Messing whit that bad chicks ride like uh rodeo
Smokin on the fire, got us higher then the holy ghost
If you ain't poppin no bottles right now (bruh ain't reppin)
I'm the freshest from dirty, Westside rollin close to {?}
From the alley, habits, might die from a overdose
On a mission my vision, clouded by the paper
Crooked, took it, cut it, shave it with the razor
Even miss my bread and butter, I ain't gettin offended
Run it not in my budget, I ain't got to share it
Who's your man? Like it, love it, not to want to play it
{?} on them thugs, money on the table
Who who play in the club? You fuckin with the mayor
I'll be damned, fresh in the mud, put you on the payroll
What'chu want? Say what you want, it's all about me
We get high and run in the hood, you fall around me

Haters don't like me, and I don't like you either
You mad cause I'm stacked up, and you underachiever
You see the plat' Amex, you still fuck with Visas

Nigga roll the trees up, what the fuck you waitin on?
We talkin 'bout this money, so go on make a hatin song
Gucci's on my feet, but my jeans look like dollar signs
'cicles on my teeth, so I'm talkin money all the time
G's I'ma follow mine, you don't want no part of mine
Chopper in the back'll have you leapin like Impala signs
Big Tank, Big Cat, nigga what you know about it?
Sittin in the booth, and they told me bring the flow up out it
Go getter fo' sho' about it, money over e'rythang
Stackin up this paper 'til it's higher than a airplane

It's lonely up here, man I need to come down
So many O's I made the bank teller pass out

[Gucci Mane]
My trap house floors lookin like a Magic City Monday
But ain't no singles, it's just big head hundreds
My car's gettin watched by this ugly-ass junkie
I keep laughin like a woman but it ain't shit funny (ha)
I'm posted in the trap and my country boys comin
I'm hood rich bitch, still servin two dummies
I'm gettin on your nerves cause Gucci got money
The charm is absurd but the rims are all shiny

[Hook]

[Gucci Mane]
I mic check, I mic check, now it's time the chicken talk
One scratch on my Nike checks, I cop another pair
I got stacks on deck, make the girl break her neck
When she hit the bubble kush the bitch coughed up her breakfast
I'm the realest make a bet, I bet the checks don't bounce
So much cash in the bag I make accountants lose count
Your girl say she love to see a thug iced out
With me and Speedy on the track it's the return of chicken talk
Gucci!

[Hook]

[Intro]
(Zaytoven!!)

[Verse One]
Game choppin like my rims, I'm choppin it up
'Til my 'caine gold like a pimp, I'm fresh as a bud
Plus I'm blowin on the sticky green, so I'm dro'ed up
And I'm rollin on the bean, so the city SLOWED UP~!
My team showed up, so you know we need a party pack
Callin Momma Stash, say she wanna be a part of that
Tell her I'm for real, and I keep a knot folded back
The next thang you know she tossin pills like a quarterback
Guc', I'ma throw it back, stacks I just showed you that
Deuces on the 88, they say I brought the roller back
Fifty for a dollar, hell yeah I can roll with that
Take it to the hood and let, Yatta get ahold of that
Got to be the coldest cat, ice froze the thermostats
Shawty had a Cali tat and Gucci called the Alley Cat
Shot a couple triple stacks and po'd up the iced tea
Slide on my stunna shades; geeked up? I might be

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]
Said I'm higher than a kite and me geeked up on these pills
Suave Stacks got me actin out, I know that she can tell
That I'm rollin (yeah) like the wheels on a bus
I need a cold Tropicana cause my heart about to bust
Look I'm sweatin like a dog and she askin for some mo'
Gave her couple of blue dolphins and I tell her to go raw
Bright lights lookin psychadelic, I'm off in the zone
Feelin strong like Superman, bitch I bust your dome
Said I'm smokin all the purple and drinkin all the 'gnac up
And I ain't feelin none of that until the next mornin bruh
My stomach fucked up, a couple holes in my brain
But I party like a rockstar, these bitches askin mane!

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
Gucci Mane, Laflare nigga, get'cha mind right
Order Crist' by the 12 like a case of Bud Light
Sell kush by the bell so you know my shit tight
7:30 in the mornin on an all night flight
I'm high like Fabo, hood like Shawty
So +Tell Me Where to Go+ like my name E-40
A rich rock star nigga I'm gon' party
Got a party pack of pills that's at least 'bout 40
I'll pour 'em in yo' hand like a bag of jelly beans
Take two of these pills call me in the morning
Fifty thousand pills man I'm so real
Three dollars for a pill that's a damn good deal

[Chorus]

[Mac Bre-Z]
Ay whassup Gucci Mane!
Why you sweatin so hard?

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
What they do? What they do?
They get drunk and they get loose
Mix that Goose with Absolute
Then they turn to prostitutes

[Khia]
(Tell me what they do?)
Thug Misses and I'm lookin for a Thug Mister
Big spender, break bread like a real mister
Drop low to your knees boy, whistle on it
Then put that wood on me, cut me like you paid for it
It's on you, let me know if you really want it
You on Goose, so I know you gon' get loose
Pop a pill, do what you been wantin to do
Then make it rain like a motherfuckin hurricane
I hate lames, if you want it you gotta suck on it
Get it right, if you want it you gotta bid on it
Real thick and my sugar got gold on it
Spend on it, make a chick put her friend on it
Good neck, good back, ohh yeah I want it!!
Slide on it, make a chick wanna ride on it
Hair on it mean the nigga ain't scared of it
Thug Misses, Gucci Mane and you still want it

[Chorus]

[Gucci Mane]
Tell me what they do?
For about a hundred dollars she'll let you come through
Two hundred dollars take her clothes off too
Three hundred she'll be all on you
For the fo' give a blowjob 'til she turn blue
Five hundred dollars she'll eat a girl too
Drop the whole stack she'll do the whole crew
Hoes get loose when they drink Grey Goose
Seee the Coupe on rims with the big sunroof
You can bring your friend and your homegirl too
Damn what you heard, baby girl it ain't true
I don't like her girl I really like you
Cause she already told me what she wan' do
Love it when you fresh and you wear perfume
Everybody stare when I walk in the room
Chain frostbit like a New Year's Eve
But the watch on fire like the first day of June

[Khia]
Let me show you what a real boss chick do
Make you feel real special when I'm on you
Slide low lay back and enjoy the ride
Super wet stay gushin on the inside
Water flowin like a stream call me Aquafina
A real bad mamma jammer, love it when you beat it
Stay fresh, stay tight, pumpin all night
I got that comeback, strokin on it just right
Guys we can play hard if you want to
Act like you don't want it when you know you do
It's real simple, use your lips then use your chin
Tip that pole back, baby sip on all the milk
Fruity Pebbles lips tastin like Fruit Loops
Lovin what you do when you gone on the Goose
You love it what I'm doin when I'm gone on the Goose
You gettin crunk and loose, good to know you suck it too

[Chorus]

Geah, geah, geah, yeah

[Verse 1]
To my guala, my partner, molta manana
Gracias, de nada, brought me years of dollars
Que pasa amigo? Cocaine more bonito
Cohina mucho es grande on the repo
Ese el pablo, my barrio your barrio
Comprende my friende you speak real good ingles
Six hundred Wednesday, five thousand Tuesday
El nombre es Gucci, no punta, no pussy
Coronas and kushi, kilos and elbows
Chito seritos, they come from Mexico, there he go
Twenty tacos and it got me fifty burritos
S550 Mercedes on Flat Shoals
Que pasa, manana, my guala guala my partner partner
Love to treat a nigga to a steak and a lobster
Now a nigga owe them a million dollars
Got me making ten G's an hour, money's power, time is money
You don't know the nigga then serve the dummy
Serve the junkies then ride Ashantis

[Chorus]
When I see my plug this how I talk to 'em
And when I serve my folks this how I talk to 'em
When I'm with my dogs dis how I talk to 'em
It's Gucci Mane, Laflare, I'm fin' to talk to 'em

[Verse 2]
What the bumba claat? My trap spot, dreadlocks and rastas
Rude boys and rude girls, Jamaican mobsters
I shot the sheriff, smokin' Bob Marley
All of this ecstasy is killin' me softly
Turgo and curry, mid grade so pretty
Sex spot my ex-spot, can't dodge that red dot
Smokin' the lah-lah, can't get no higher
Where is me iya? She sends me fiyah
Where is me lighter? Look at me ice-a
Step up your neck piece, I like your wife-a
I pack a rifle, I loves me life-a
Put up your hands 'fore I put up my rifle

[Chorus]
When I see my plug this how I talk to 'em
And when I serve my folks this how I talk to 'em
When I'm with my dogs dis how I talk to 'em
It's Gucci Mane, La flare, I'm fin' to talk to 'em

[Verse 3]
What's up nigga, what it do? I'm good my nigga, how are you?
Half a chicken, whole chicken, quarter chicken, what it move?
Bentley coupe on Bentley shoes, hell naw them ain't 22's
Still keep coke in inner tubes, plottin' on my next business move
Twenty-six inch tennis shoes, old school painted Maserati blue
Brought my gun, but forgot my roof, pullin' up wit'cha baby boo
Ooh ooh, it's you know who, it's NASCAR baby what you gon' do
Looking for somethin' thick I can screw, paint change and my diamonds too Trap nigga watch remindin' you

Everytime you put on your booty shorts

[Verse 1]
I don't holla at girls girls holla at me
I don't throw dollars at girls, they throw dollars at me
Gucci you conceited bitch I might be
Cause my chain so bright Stevie Wonder might see
Yea you got a man but ya man ain't me
Add ya whole life savings times three
The mouth full of dro and the clothes ain't free
So you gotta be a dimepiece to approach me
How much 'unh can one girl take
How many cakes can one man bake
Playa on the real man I don't know
I just love it when they fresh and they ass cheeks show
Everybody stare when I walk in the room
Smokin on purp got me high like the moon
Chain front big like its New Year's Eve
But my Rollie on fire like the first day of June

[Chorus]
Put on your booty shorts
Ooh, I really like the sexy way you walk
Ooh, I like the way you make your booty talk
Everytime you put on your booty shorts
Believe dat girl

Stuntin in the club wit my nigga Big Kap
Made the waitress come back wit 20 mo' stacks
Iced out chain got a iced out grill
Independent I ain't got no deal
Hood rich bitch do ya know the feelin?

Shawty got some shorts on oh, so small
Say she like me cause my rims real tall
If you want work bitch you can call us
You in big wheels baby we some ballers
Money ain't a thang to the boy Gucci Mane
Old school Chevy same color cocaine
Ridin through the hood throwin money out the brain
And I'm lookin for the girls wit the booty shorts mane

[Chorus]
Put on your booty shorts
Ooh, I really like the sexy way you walk
Ooh, I like the way you make your booty talk
Everytime you put on your booty shorts
Believe dat girl

But I betcha you'd look betta wit these microbraids
Girls in the club like dat there stank

Me and HB keep a big bankroll pulled up in a Hemi wit the Lambo Doors

Neva seen a young man paint so wet hood rich and my album ain't even dropped yet

When we get home I'm a break her spine
Get in her ear and corrupt her mind

[Verse 5: Jody Breeze]
Look I slang in my white but I bang in my black tee

Niggas mad cause I'm hot and they ain't gettin no love
Dammmn shawty! I'm straight from the streets
Sticks and stones break bones, words motivate me

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Gucci finally made it, niggas player hated
When I hit the club I got twenty G's to play with
Bitch I'm the brick man, ballin like a rich man
Sippin on this syrup got me leanin like a kickstand
Recognize the pimpin, feel the real attention
Laflare Entertainment, I'm playin my position
Waitin on the bitches, holla at the bitches
Never worked for Church's but I served a lot of chickens
Got a lot of G's so I do a little trickin
Hoe take this lil' money bitch and go on about ya business
Every day is Christmas, every night is Valentine's
Ten in New York, it's nine Alabama time
Moved to A-T-L, the whole East Atlanta mine
Billion dollar deal, I signed on the dotted line
Gucci 'bout to pimp shit, lobster steak and shrimp shit
Big Cat, Laflare, you try and get your wig split

[Hook: Young Snead]
Dammmn shawty! Why you hatin so hard?

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
They say my chain so cold, but my watch too hot
My earrings bling, pinkie ring on fire
Twinkle twinkle, see the stars pass by
Gucci Mane ain't hot? Youse a God damn liar
Why ask why? Niggas go Bud Dry
A case of Cristal and a black fo'-five
Hoes in the club like "Who is that guy?
Drinkin Cristal throwin money in the sky?"
His fit so sharp and his wheels so large
The rims keep spinnin but the car stay parked
Fo' bedroom with the two car garage
Gucci just copped, nigga I ain't got a flaw
Wet paint job and the automatic start
Semi-automatic if you try to play hard
Gucci Mane Montana, from East Atlanta
Bitch the diamonds in my chain same color bananas
Uhh

[Hook: Young Snead] (x2)

Hotter than cooking with lard, Gucci Mane on the block again
And I'm cooking you boys, it's that grown ass shit, nigga, bring all the toys

Bring the whole entourage, since you thinking you hard

If you from the hood, then you sellin somethin
2:22, time to cook a deuce
Fo' my lil' partner, I call his ass the truth
3:34, time to swing the door
Ninety-sixty hundred, fo' a pound of dro'
4:46, trunk full of bricks
Can't stop trappin, 'til I'm fithy rich
Dropped out of school, 1998
Bought a box Chevy, and a half of cake
2K3, hit a lick
Hundred pounds of weed, fifty bricks

[Chorus]
East Atlanta, Zone 6, that's my hood
That's my hood, nigga, that's my hood
Glenwood to Gresham Road, that's my hood
That's my hood, nigga, that's my hood
Bouldercrest to flat shoals nigga that's my hood
That's my hood, nigga, that's my hood
I can't forget Candler Road, that's my hood
That's my hood, nigga, that's my hood

[Verse 3]
Uhhhh, age thirteen, I'm a trap star
Paid a fifty slab fo' a junkie car
School's still in, but I'm at home
Standin on the corner, with some Ewings on
Turned fifteen, and I'm trapped out
Bet a hundred dollars, just to crap out
Seventeen now, and I'm on the grind
Never stand in line at the five-five-nine
Nineteen years, blood sweat and tears
Sellin innertubes like Goodyear
Twenty-one now, I'm a grown up
So when you call my phone, it's a zone up
Age twenty-five, and it's gettin worse
18.5, fo' a hook and verse
'fo I turn thirty, I'll be thirty plus
Swimmin in the bucks, like Scrooge McDuck

[Chorus]
East Atlanta, Zone 6, that's my hood
That's my hood, nigga, that's my hood
Glenwood to Gresham Road, that's my hood
That's my hood, nigga, that's my hood
Bouldercrest to flat shoals nigga that's my hood
That's my hood, nigga, that's my hood
I can't forget Candler Road, that's my hood
That's my hood, nigga, that's my hood

[Outro]
Uhhhhhhh...

[Intro]
In the Trap house, in the Trap House, in the Trap House
Gucci Mane Check It

[Chorus]
Choppa on the floor pistol on the couch
Hood rich so I never had a bank account
Junkies going in junkies going out
Made a hundred thou, In my Trap House
Money kinda short but we can work it out
Made a hundred thou, in my Trap House
Bricks going in, bricks going out
Made a hundred thou, in my Trap House

[Verse 1]
I'm tired of selling bricks I wanna go legit
I wonder can I sell 11 mill like 50 Cent
Cause platinum ain't enough I got too many vices
I love to smoke weed love to shoot dices
Say my lifestyle extravagant
I talk cash shit, bitches say I'm arrogant
Well goddamn Gucci cocky then
But at the same time young hoes be jocking slim
"Gucci ain't shit.", Bitch, I beg your pardon
I'm independent but I'm balling like a major artist
I stay high like giraffe pussy
In My Trap House smokin' bubba kushie

[Chorus]
Choppa on the floor pistol on the couch
Hood rich so I never had a bank account
Junkies going in junkies going out
Made a hundred thou, In my Trap House
Money kinda short but we can work it out
Made a hundred thou, in my Trap House
Bricks going in, bricks going out
Made a hundred thou, in my Trap House

[Verse 2]
Jumped out the whip everybody looking
Big clouds of smoke but ain't nobody cooking
(female talking) "Girl, there go Gucci Mane
I want his autograph cause I'm his biggest fan"
Yellow Humm-V with the yellow feet
Yellow diamonds the same color cheddar cheese
And I'm smoking on that purple shit
They call me temp service cause I'll work a bitch
Money long like Shaq feet
Running dough like a sprinter at a track meet
I heard he got that soft white
Extended clips make them busters get they mind right

[Chorus]
Choppa on the floor pistol on the couch
Hood rich so I never had a bank account
Junkies going in junkies going out
Made a hundred thou, In my Trap House
Money kinda short but we can work it out
Made a hundred thou, in my Trap House
Bricks going in, bricks going out
Made a hundred thou, in my Trap House

[Verse 3]
In my trap house watchin SportsCenter
In the kitchen cooking but I ain't cooking dinner
Splash it with the water whip it make it harder
17 for 'em the same number as Qunice Carter
Say I'm working with wit a mill or better
Married to the game me and money live together
Street smart niggah never listen to the teacher
You can catch me in the bathroom smoking reefer
Prices low like Walmart
Bricks on aisle 9 get ya shopping cart
Knee deep in the dope game
I'm not a farmer but I'm known to push them collard greens

[Chorus]
Choppa on the floor pistol on the couch
Hood rich so I never had a bank account
Junkies going in junkies going out
Made a hundred thou, In my Trap House
Money kinda short but we can work it out
Made a hundred thou, in my Trap House
Bricks going in, bricks going out
Made a hundred thou, in my Trap House

[Chorus]
In the club tryin' to find me a bad ass broad
Gave her five for the pussy then I took her to the mall
That's all, baby girl that's all
18 for the whole nine-five for the half
Came up in the hood sellin' fifty dollar slabs
That's all, playboy that's all

[Verse 1]
When them bottles start poppin' girls start jockin'
The girl so fine that I took the chick shoppin'
Deuces on the old school smokin' on the dro fool
Know that it's a hit, my voice done hit the pro tool
Gucci mane frank nitty got it like
That never seen a chick wit' a body like that
Shawty acting feisty too damn sheisty
Get with Gucci Mane baby you be so icy
Can't lie baby girl you fine ass hell
Will I hit it in the first date time will tell
Baby says she like the way the top drop back
Never thought my homeboy girl a jock like that
40 on the bracelet back to the basic
A mill worth of ice in these playa haters faces
A mill worth of ice Gucci mane good gracious
Got a sick flow and I think it's contagious

[Chorus]
In the club tryin' to find me a bad ass broad
Gave her five for the pussy then I took her to the mall
That's all, baby girl that's all
18 for the whole nine-five for the half
Came up in the hood sellin' fifty dollar slabs
That's all, playboy that's all

[Verse 2]
I ain't wit that flexin' cat he investing
Tell these playa haters to check my BDS spins
Like Yao Ming man my money staked tall
I deal for a half a mill nigga that's all
See a bad broad Gucci mane I'll buy
The same dude you shop wit I'm his supplier
Gucci Gucci Gucci yours truly that's me
Hood rich or cocky I just might be
Wit my chain so bright Ray Charles might see
More ice on me than a game of hockey
If you want a mean dick you can ride in my six
Suck a good dick then I'll get your hair fixed
Gucci brake bricks down used to sell fifties
Watch on my wrist man it cost a buck fifty
King of the city Gucci mane Frank Nitty
I'll gives a bitch a dove if she let me touch her titties

[Chorus]
In the club tryin' to find me a bad ass broad
Gave her five for the pussy then I took her to the mall

18 for the whole nine-five for the half
Came up in the hood sellin' fifty dollar slabs
That's all, playboy that's all

[Verse 3]
Gucci Mane make you look like you posed to look
Gucci shoes Gucci fit and a pocketbook
Let you party like a rock star, ride in a boxcar
Have you gainin' weight every day eatin' lobster
All you friends invited so you can bring a partner
Gucci in the hood sellin' weed like a doctor
Fifty dollar slab to a trunk full of holes
Never at the house cause I'm always doing shows
Teamed up wit' big cat now they want to chit chat
Role to crash road, flat shoals represent that
Gucci in the booth and my flows crazy
Is it hot in here nigga or it's just me
Have you at south beach falling of Jet Ski
Smokin purple weed under shade of palm trees
In Biloxi, we could spend a hundred G's
I'll play the craps table, you can get the slot machine

[Chorus]
In the club tryin' to find me a bad ass broad
Gave her five for the pussy then I took her to the mall
That's all, baby girl that's all
18 for the whole nine-five for the half
Came up in the hood sellin' fifty dollar slabs
That's all, playboy that's all

[Verse 1]
I Remeber when I first laid eyes on you
My man Tom introduced us but I was too shy to say hi
When I finaly built up enough nerve to drop a line
You made it clear you wasn't just a MySpace mistress
And I didn't take it personal
When you ignored my request to be your friend
I spilled my guts and hit send
Waited 2 weeks for a response and got nothin
Honestly it only made me want you more
Week 4 rolled around and I was this close to letting go
But something wouldn't let me even though i hardly knew you
Its plain to see we were meant to lock lips
You knocked me out with the brass knuckle tats on your hips
I was on this website late nite lurken
When I got a message from you labeled urgent
You sayed you wasn't impressed by lame dudes with no game
They're all the same, tryna get your instant messaging name
But the fact that you hit me back made me smile
You must of saw something you liked when you was skimming through my profile
You caught me at the most pivitle moment
Now I'll mailing my love with a dozen digital roses

[Hook]
So click approve
So sick
But show me some kind of sign
And let me know its time to make my move
Click approve
Come on girl baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose
Click approve
Killin me here just show me some kind of sign
And let me know its time to make my move
Click approve
Come on girl baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose

[Verse 2]
Lets face it
Its a sad situation that we have to resort
To keyboard as a means of making relations but
I don't have the patients I'll get straight to the point
So this is me at my most honest
No egos
No Gym Class status just Travis
Love it or leave it but you got to admit
On the scale of 1 to Awesome I'm the shit
Just get over it and add me God damn it I've been waiting too long
I even wrote a song about it like to hear it here it go
If I'm being too annoying let me know. . . just let me know
But its hard for me to not hate when I'm on MySpace
I never see my face in your Top 8
Approaching 6 weeks now its kind of obvious
That you either occupied or playin a game
All my money on the matter this is not a L O L matter
Why would you pass up a chance this great
If I had 2 forces
And I split them down the middle
I could swing back and forth for 3 days
Rephrase
If I had 2 horses and I beatem wit authority
I'd gallop all the way to Canada to see your face
But All I got is powerbook and iChat
Beside I hit you all the time but you never write back
I stay on my feet . . . .Shit
And be persistant till my name is under who you'd like to meet

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
'81 was the year shit hit the fan in a major way
A sad day for aspiring artists
Almost 20 years after the fact I'm still on my hustle
Diggin' graves for an aspiring artists
Pushing daises up
And never compromise the arts to make a crowd clap
Shit on since the first show
But we turned feces to fertilizer
So when you diss it's just food for the flowers to grow
Sold 15 plus out of backpacks, no trunks
Too young to drive
Put live hip hop in the ears of upstate kids
That thought rap was past tense, hence the last name
Got name for playing basements and such and making songs that our friends loved
And when the fish bowl got too small to hold the goldfish
We filled our gills with water and ripped that mother fucker like

[Hook]
So take a step back
And a breath in
Let it out now
Put your chin up
You can do it tiger
You a man now
And in your dream it's time to do the best you can now

[Chorus]
We break ourselves down
And build ourselves up in disappointment
How fragile we are
So fragile we are, we just don't show it
We'll shake up this town
And shoot down the stars for our enjoyment
So sexy we are
So sexy we are, we just don't know it

[Verse 2]
This is what you wanted right?
How many nights were spent pouring out your guts dummy?
How many punishments endured for fucking up in school?
How many teachers proved wrong by writing songs instead?
(My point exactly)
But you knew you had a spark, did you?
Something producin' to the dreams your pop's dreams lent you
Stay focused when nothing seemed to make sense
Stealing verses with that Cassius Clay confidence
Sometimes you stubborn as shit, that's the McCoy in you
You learn to be a man without losing the boy in you
(Just do your thing man)

[Hook]
So take a step back
And a breath in
Let it out now
Put your chin up
You can do it tiger
You a man now
And in your dream it's time to do the best you can now
So take a step back
And a breath in
Let it out now
Put your chin up
You can do it tiger
You a man now
And in your dream it's time to do the best you can now

[Chorus]
We break ourselves down
And build ourselves up in disappointment
How fragile we are
So fragile we are, we just don't show it
We'll shake up this town
And shoot down the stars for our enjoyment
So sexy we are
So sexy we are, we just don't know it
We break ourselves down
And build ourselves up in disappointment
How fragile we are
So fragile we are, we just don't show it
We'll shake up this town
And shoot down the stars for our enjoyment
So sexy we are
So sexy we are, we just don't know it

[Hook]
So take a step back
And a breath in
Let it out now
Put your chin up
You can do it tiger
You a man now
And in your dream it's time to do the best you can now

[Chorus]
We break ourselves down
And build ourselves up in disappointment
How fragile we are
So fragile we are, we just don't show it
We'll shake up this town
And shoot down the stars for our enjoyment
So sexy we are
So sexy we are, we just don't know it
We break ourselves down
And build ourselves up in disappointment
How fragile we are
So fragile we are, we just don't show it
We'll shake up this town
And shoot down the stars for our enjoyment

[Verse 1]
I love it how she breathes booze in the mornin'
Man, it's so sexy how she can't remember last night
I made a fatal mistake of letting her drink again
But who the hell am I to tell her how to live her life?
And if you could put dumb in a shot glass
I'm just another lush who's had one too many in me
And please not enough
I see you stand there, settle for anything, anything's better than lettin' her
Think she could do better than me
She'll come around eventually

Cause baby girl's a queen
But the queen's just a pawn with a bunch of fancy moves
And she's made me a fiend
I'm going through withdrawals but I got nothing to lose

[Hook]
Oh no
She's at the bottom of that bottle
She's only one more swallow
From being, oh, so hollow
(Hey! Hey! Hey!)
Bravo, she's at the bottom of that bottle
She's only one more swallow
From being, oh, so hollow

[Verse 2]
I find it funny she can never find her car keys
Immediately after telling me she can't take it
She makes the cutest faces when she screams obscenities
And slurs her words because she's never not inebriated
And the front page headline read
"Let the girl go, you know you can do better"
It's bad, when the fact that you can't have her
Is the reason you sweat her
Don't let her take advantage of you
Like the other girls let her
You better cut your losses now buddy

Cause baby girl's a queen
But the queen's just a pawn with a bunch of fancy moves
And she's made me a fiend
I'm going through withdrawals but I got nothing to lose

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Drown yourself, it's not worth keeping me
Just put it down right now and bow out gracefully
(Cause baby girl's a queen
The queen's just a pawn with a bunch of fancy moves
And she's made me a fiend
I'm going through withdrawals but I got nothing to lose)

[Hook]

[Sample]
(Fame, fortune, platinum records
It's every boys dream...)

[Intro]
True story
Somebody asked me one time
"Travie, you high?
You look high"
"Shit, yeah I'm high"
Let's go

[Verse 1]
The world is yours, so play the role
Blow the dust off this record and put the needle down slow
Our veins are cold, but we'll never grow old
Let's have a toast, and raise our drinks
No hearts on our sleeves, just eagles on our cuff links
It's such a rush to know you love me so much

[Pre-Hook]
We'll do whatever you want to
Girl I'll make a movie star of you
You know that I could
If you let me be your Hollywood

[Hook]
We'll get high, and hide
We all lust to the glamorous
White girl so fine
Going up on the downtown line
We'll get high, and hide
We all lust to the glamorous
White girl so fine
Going up on the downtown line

[Verse 2]
Take your razor, break down my line
Put your nose to the speaker
Now breathe in, breathe in
Clean up your nose, and face the crowd
Then kiss your mirror 'cause we're all stars now
Isn't it fun how music makes your lips numb?

[Pre-Hook]
We'll do whatever you want to
Girl I'll make a movie star of you
You know that I could
If you let me be your Hollywood

[Hook]
We'll get high, and hide
We all lust to the glamorous
White girl so fine
Going up on the downtown line
We'll get high, and hide
We all lust to the glamorous
White girl so fine
Going up on the downtown line

[Bridge]
Take your razor, break down my line
Put your nose to the speaker
Now breathe in, breathe in

[Hook]
We'll get high, and hide
We all lust to the glamorous
White girl so fine
Going up on the downtown line
We'll get high, and hide
We all lust to the glamorous
White girl so fine
Going up on the downtown line

[Outro]
Breathe in...
Breathe in...
Breathe in...
Breathe in...

[Verse 1]
Yo, My morning showers like a rebirth; reflections of the womb
Crazy sentimental floatin' in lukewarm placental
Now I chop a burden on the sink trying not to think about what
Lies before me but the sun just reassured me that
Everythings gonna be allright, the last thing on my mind is tonight
Its like a sintch and getting Zestfully clean not to mention
Scrub my ass and armpits for a bit and then I split over to the mirror
Wipe the dew to make my vision clearer
Then I moisturize my face with some aloe Vera
This is that type of day cause I can feel it that
You ain't letting bad vibes invade your spirit
Anyway it's time to get the breath right
So I grab the Crest and toothbrush, circular motions to the left, right
Just enough to see the teeth sparkle a bit
I fill my grill with Listerine and then it's gargle, gargle, spit
And now that's good hygiene, you know what I mean?
And my mouths the definition of so fresh and so clean (clean)
I feel it's only right, since my words all I got
And nobody wants to listen when your breath is hot
But that's a story in itself so I head to my bedroom
Throw on some drawers and pick out a costume
I think ill rock these blue jeans and this tee shirt
And whats a little polo sport gonna hurt?
C'mon

[Hook]
This is that day cause I can feel it
You know the type of day you ain't lettin' bad vibes invade your spirit
As the birds chirp your favorite tune
It's like I'm right back in my momma's womb
Cause everything is so serine
And the temperature is just right
Not a worry in sight
And plus the sun is shining bright, it's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day

[Verse 2]
Shall I continue where I left off?
I'm feelin' kinda lovely but my
Tummy is growlin' so I'm feeling kinda hungry
So I hit the kitchen and I'm wishin' there's some food in sight
What do ya know? I got that Cinnamon Life
And now I'm real happy, fill my salad bowl up with cereal
To my surprise it's Jackson Five up on the stereo
I turn it up my words can't describe my reaction to
Wakin' up and listening to prepubescent Michael Jackson
Open up the Frigidair what do we have here?
Seems like just enough milk to fill my morning craving
Peep out the window just to see if Izzy is misbehaving
He's staring at me with a grin like 'Yo, let me in man!'
So I begin to fill his dish with Kibbles N' Bits
Let him in so he can eat, and I'm eating my shit
So now we both full and well fed
Happier than that fat rat Templeton from Charlotte's Web
And now its time to get our walk on
Izzy can get his bark on
It's a beautiful day maybe we'll get our state park on
I know the lake is at its finest (you better take afvantage)
I'll grab my backpack, this leash, and maybe make a sandwich
I better grab my ghetto blaster and a few tapes
A thurmos full of water and a bag of fresh grapes
Some more tapes cause you know that music comes first
And what's a little Jackson Five gonna hurt?
C'mon

[Hook x2]
Why do people fear what they don't know?
Constantly lookin' at me funny cause my pants swung low
And my hats rocked to the left
All these dirty looks be gettin me stressed
It's time to dead that
Testify and get your head wrapped like Arabian cats
Terrorist act's will have you pigs squealin at last
Wayne County Jail full of noxious gas
Got three quarters of your senses massed
You're left with only the sense of Touch like Tony
The majority of these boys in blue are phony
Crooked like Saint Ides, instead of tryin to save lives
They out for delph, only tryin to help them self
They pull me over talkin about a seatbelt, we all know thats bullshit
The fact is I look suspicious, THATS IT!!
Type of kid to expose corruption, like crop circles and alien abductions
Park patrolling toy cop reproductions
Hunger for power equals negative reprocussions
Get rushed as if I was rushin with no discussion
Try and cuff me and catch a mild concussion
I've taken all the stress I can
Peace America I'm movin off to foreign lands
Where cops don't place narcotics in innocent hands
Framin cats just to meet a quota
Searchin' everyone with baggy pants and Moterola's
Thats why I'm wild with a camcorder
To catch 'em slippin when they pull me over
Flip 'em the bird then I'm ghost in my Toyota
Won't stop writin til this shit cease
Until someone's there to police the police
I'm sick of all this everyday harassment
(Sick of hopelessly watchin my man gettin his ass kicked, sick of being
Followed shit is drastic)
Sick of havin visions of black caskets (just because we rock our pants low)
And our hats backwards (These cops is like cancer)
A tumor on our ass (We want answers)
For bad manners (And the use of police scanners)
So we jottin down their numbers (In our pocket planners)
For the day we meet up (With Jim Shapiro) THE HAMMER!

They got this little game that they play
Tellin you that you that you done somethin wrong
Then they flash the badge in your face
And you don't even know what's goin' on
They don't even give you a reasons, orno clue as to what it is you've done
You go for your registration, and then they put your ass to sleep
(And tell the chief you reached for heat)

Cops be poppin' confiscated Glocks with a sack of rocks right under it
The funny thing is, this murders funded by the government
Yo they'll kill you and put the crack in your pocket to make it legal
Illegally plant the confiscated gat right by you in your Regal
And say you shot first, delete you from digital files its lethal
Most of these cops is see through, that's why we do what we do
That's why we tell the truth about what police do
Son they'll issue you a ticket right before they beat you
I'm glad the truth scares you, hit me mr.officer I dare you
Check the rearview, you'll see the camcorder, extended lens too
You better call for back-up, chew the rest of that crack up
Cause we got you on tape with that girl you raped and handcuffed
Yeah you shook now, and if you swing on me I'm about to fight back
The man ain't nothin but the klan, but not in white they rockin blue and black
It's a proven fact cops is just white collared criminals
They ride in Crown V's injectin neighborhoods with chemicals
I'm tellin you, it all makes sense they killed the president
Sniped him out with one shot then lurked out with all the evidence
I'm speakin relevance, ignorant heads won't try to hear me
Cause the truth will make the masses bug out, like Tim Leary
If you want kids off the streets give us somethin to do
Instead of constant harassment and curfew's (COME ON)
Since when did dreadlocks become probable cause
Totin' around a backpack become breakin the law
Son I'm fed up, so get up, stand up like Bob told you
And learn some Tai Bo in case they try to choke hold you
I'm sick of all this everyday harassment
(Sick of hopelessly watchin my man gettin his ass kicked, sick of being
Called a black bastard)
Sick of havin visions of black caskets (Just because we rock our pants low)
And our hats backwards (These cops is like cancer)
A tumor on our ass, (we want answers)
For bad manners (and the use of police scanners)
So we jottin' down their numbers (in our pocket planners)
For the day we meet up (with Jim Shapiro) THE HAMMER!
(I'm sick of all this everyday harassment)

(for the day we meet up) With Jim Shapiro THE HAMMER!
Let the bass make your spine jerk, drums make your ears hurt
Hear me deliverin' this phat ass verse, been puttin' in work
Eventually I'll master the craft and sit back
Grab the phone and tell the boss to kiss my ass
You won't see me in the mornin', 8 o'clock on the button
I'll be on the lake fishin', blazin' fire with my cousin
(THAT'S IT) As I become one with the fish
Collect my thoughts for a bit until I'm ready to spit
Pick up my celly and shit, then proceed to hit up my kids
And connect 'em voice dialed through sprint
I tell 'em meet me at the spot with some hot ish
They say 'Jimmy you got lyrics?', SON I GOT THIS!!
Continuously the past two days kid I been writin'
Had to polish my game to make the stage show excitin'
It's frightenin', while y'all hang loose we keep it tightened
Y'all talk like thunder, we show and prove like lightnin'
Aight then, why you always hatin' on me?
I'm doin' my thing on stage, I make the crowds move for free
I ain't getting' paid nothin', so why you frontin'?
With all that hard talkin' you're about to start something
You don't really wanna get into
I'll disassemble your nose, and possibly puncture a lung too
With a one then a two combination you're through
Blows from my Timberland boots leave you bruised like bad fruit
(SO WHAT IT LOOK LIKE) I might be white, but I still possess the skills
To rip mic's, when I'm sober, when I'm schwilled I keep it real
With my vocabulary spills I'm ill, like L, with lyrical skill
Like Hyundai cause I Accel
Whack competitors get whaced if their style's an act
It's been a long time but I'm back on the GCH track
I speak on fact while most of y'all cat's be preachin' fiction
The way you rhyme and live in life's a contradiction
You need to listen closely to the words I speak
Also get accustomed used to the word defeat
Bless beats like a Roman priest from dusk 'til dawn
My written flow be holy water, I spray shit 'til your gone..
Extra, Extra...Read all about it
You takin' us out kid, haha, I highly doubt it
When live wires connect they cause a surge
That electrocutes your ears the illest shit you ever heard
Extra, Extra...Read all about it
You takin' us out kid, haha I doubt it
When live wires connect they cause a surge
That electrocutes your ears the illest shit you ever heard

Ring the alarm, cause Travie Won is shining
Ring the alarm, cause I've begun refining
Ring the alarm, cause GCH is coming
Ring the alarm, and hear the drummer drumming

Ring Ring the alarm, bring it back to react and respond
I'll Pierce your teflon vest with Double O's like James Bond
Me say 'Mon, it be no problem', like a Jamaican
You ought never to try and compare this to you because you fakin'
(BUM-BA-CLAHT) You must have been so severely mistaken
If Hip-Hop today's a yard full of leaves, its time for rakin'
Ain't no time for playin', pay attention to these words I'm sayin'
Cause these might be the feet which to whom you will be prayin'
Verbal slayin', the last be first, first shall be last
In like 2 point 5 I get medieval on your ass
Play on the grass, but you know you're bound to step in doo-doo
Never no need to front, cause we don't be frontin' like you do
On some real shit, you don't wanna do nothin' now do you?
So screw you, we're true warriors like Shaka Zulu
With that juice, not like 2Pac's Bishop but Desmond Tutu
And there you have it, most of y'all be quick to speak on Travis
Not even knowin' the full capabilities of his madness
You thought you had this, when you can't even come near me
In fact just you thinking that shit is kinda scary
I'm leavin' heads Gratefully Dead like Jerry
Extra, Extra...Read all about it
You takin' us out kid, haha, I highly doubt it
When live wires connect they cause a surge
That electrocutes your ears the illest shit you ever heard
Extra, Extra...Read all about it
You takin' us out kid, haha I doubt it
When live wires connect they cause a surge
That electrocutes your ears the illest shit you ever heard

Everything's in the process, mad stress no rest
You could test but you'll never ever penetrate this lyrical crest
I'm armor, you'll get slapped with this fat rosey palm
Ask your mama, about that last soap opera drama
Son I'm wicked, do you want a first class ticket
To a beatin', show your ass and I'm inclined to kick it
Keep it real, that's just another bum ass deal
Sometimes I feel it makes me get a little crazy like seal
But I'm survivin', ain't drivin' cause I just got my license
All I got to my name is lint, a Herkimer diamond, and 79 cents
And a mountain bike that's just about as broke as my pockets
I'm broke to the point that I'm about to pull my own eye sockets
But there's more to life than just them new Jordan's, and right now
I'm rockin' anything my Dad's affordin', I come complete
Whole like Vitamin D, while cat's just Skim the surface
If 2% is real the other 98 is nervous
Open your eyes, take off them shades you ain't the secret service
Don't be surprised, realize that 'No disguise' can hide your worthless
I've tried and cried a million times to find my sole purpose
I've tried and cried a million times to find my soul purpose

[Intro: Travie McCoy]
See, here's the thing

[Hook: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off (so sexy)
We have to party all night
We have to take our clothes off
To have a good time, oh no no no

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
Excuse me miss
I couldn't help but to notice how alone you are
I dig the attitude and how you're acting like you own the bar
Got me flashing keys and I don't even own a car
Like you ain't feeling my charm, because I know you are
I'm trying to see how your lips feel
Oh I'm sorry, my name is Travie and I'm pretty much a big deal
Oh, you've never heard of me
That sounds absurd to me
The way you stole my attention was flat out burglary
What do you say let's exit stage left so me and you can
Possibly reconvene and play some Naked Peek-A-Boo
Cause after all the blouse you're wearing is kinda see through
And it's obvious I'm heading wherever you're leading me too
Such an angel with a devilish angle
And quite the certified sweet talker
And you're buying every line of it girl
And I don't really blame you
If I was in your shoes I'd probably do the same too

[Hook: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off (so sexy)
We have to party all night
We have to take our clothes off
To have a good time, oh no no no

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
Now here's another barn burner for the slow learners
Put your helmets on and take a seat on the short bus
Next stop, right around the corner from your momma live
No turning back so you better buckle up
Shit, don't be concerned with mine
I feel like a Speak-n-Spell way I got you learning my lines
Fine, pull the string, replay that shit
I change my name to "did he really just say that shit?" (Yep)
I'll take a mile if you let me
Six-five, two hundred plus and so sexy
My legs going numb for keeping my phone on vibrate
To hide the fact your girlfriend keeps textin' me
And I've been trying to never mind it man
But every time I get a new number, she finds it damn
And you thought you had it sewn up
Until right around amazing o'clock when I showed up

[Hook: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off (so sexy)
We have to party all night
We have to take our clothes off
To have a good time, oh no no no

[Bridge: Travie McCoy]
Got chicks, all hot chicks
Indie-rock chicks, and hip-hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks
Got chicks, all hot chicks
Indie-rock chicks, and hip-hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks

[Verse 3: Travie McCoy]
Good grief girl, you're giving me goosebumps
Standing there in your underwear and new pumps
It's like the more time we waste and less time I get to taste you
Honestly I could easily replace you
It's not a scam girl
That's how I am girl
Peter Pan, I'm a sucker for Smucker's jam girl
It's clear I'm only here for good clean fun
Shut up and kiss me like the antidotes under my tongue
Whoa

[Hook: Patrick Stump]
We have to take our clothes off
We have to party all night
We have to take our clothes off
To have a good time, oh no no no
We have to take our clothes off (so sexy)
We have to party all night
We have to take our clothes off
To have a good time, oh no no no

[Bridge: Travie McCoy]
Got chicks, all hot chicks
Indie-rock chicks, and hip-hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks
Got chicks, all hot chicks
Indie-rock chicks, and hip-hop chicks
Slim chicks, round chicks
Black, white, yellow, and brown chicks

[Spoken Outro]

[Verse One]
Thank you, you know exactly who you are
You played the role of superglue when I was fallin apart
Through all the papercuts and all the broken hearts
You played the role of superglue when I was fallin apart
Thank you, you know exactly who you are
You played the role of superglue when I was fallin apart
Through all the nightmares and anxiety scares
You played the role of superglue when I was fallin apart

[Computerized voice]
Hi, it's so quiet
Where did the music go?
I was boppin my head and tappin my feet
And having a grand old time, more please!
I want more, give me more music
Give me it, now! I want it
Hey! Do you remember, that time when we were listening
To some fine music, by the Gym Class Heroes
And it was two minutes ago?
Do you remember that? That was cool
Hey! Do you remember, that time when we went fishing
With Fat Tommy and we wore clown shoes
And we caught some lake trout
But they had big teeth and antlers and Fat Tommy said
"Those are not lake trout
Those are space cowboys from West Lancanshire"
And I said, "I don't believe you"
And Fat Tommy said, "I don't believe me!"
Well, so be it, says I, do you remember that?
And now it never happened
HEY! Anyways I'm outta here
Peace

[Rainfall, drums]

[Verse 1]
You think you know, but you have no idea
This the diary of a breathing onomatopoeia
Now here's another broken link for anyone who thinks my life's together
I rock a raincoat despite the pleasant weather
God placed a permanent dark cloud above my head
But he was nice enough to loan me a holy umbrella
Thank ya fella, how considerate
I'm the illegitimate son of accident-prone degenerates
Today's forecast partly cloudy with a good chance of rain
So I wear my sarcasm badge proudly
And, flash a devilish grin
That'll make the most masculine of men skeptical of his existence
And when the rain begins, I'll take a seat to retire
And admire the spectacle from a distance
For instance, there was this cat the other day
Shooting me ice grills, but when I looked he looked the other way
Now any other day I wouldn't let this type of shit bother me
Today it was enough to make my lucky charms soggy
So, finally I stepped to him, kindly disrespected him
Looked him dead in the eyes and analyzed how it effected him
He broke down in tears talkin 'bout how God neglected him

[Hook]
Make this rain go away
Things would be much better; I swear, I swear
If that sun, can come out today
Life would be more worthwhile, worthwhile

[Verse Two]
And all it took was a sewin needle to deflate my swollen ego
Then, "pop pop!" went my God complex
I never thought nineteen years after my first breath
I'd be in art school surrounded by corny fucks debatin who's more depressed
I'm twenty-two now, and still can't deal with what's real
But I'll be damned if I give up and settle for pills
Shit my daddy taught me better; mommy taught me how to crack 40's
And jack six-packs in oversized sweaters
Over time weather changes, so I'm in the rain waitin
For the flood gates to open impersonatin
My favorite VH-1 "Behind the Music" tragedy
Catastrophe never tasted so acidic before
I'm PH balanced for the floor but strong enough to stay afloat
And doggy paddle long enough to catch that life preserver rope
And then, I'll be on a parallel ladder laughin like
Damn my man, for the love of Pete what happened
Finally I'll step to you, kindly disrespect you
Look you dead in the eyes and analyze how it affects you
Watch you break down in tears talkin bout how God neglected you

[Hook]

[Repeat 2X]
You ever watch a whole day wash away
Like your very last match that got wet the second you struck it
Well go ahead relieve your stress, kick that bucket all you want
A cigarette that never mattered's what you're stuck with

[Hook]

[Repeat the 2X above with Hook overlapping]

[Hook]
And I can hear 'em talking in the hallways
I'm always late for lunch learning dirty little leasons from you
Now my name is on the lips of every cheerleader in my school
Now I'm a legend in t
