ick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six year old baldheaded fag, blow me
You don't know me; you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But, sometimes, the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me

[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

[Outro: Eminem]
Hum, dei-dei, la-la, la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Hum, dei-dei, la-la, la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Kids!
*Television static*
*Eminem begins to snort cocaine*

[Speech: Steve King & Hailie Jade]
Hello, boys and girls! Today we're gonna talk about father and daughter relationships. Do you have a daddy? I'll bet you do!
*Hailie opens the door*
*Eminem snorts cocaine*
Who's your daddy?
Daddy, what are you doing?

[Intro: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
Ha-ha!
Okay then! Everybody, listen up!
I'm goin' to hell! Who's comin' with me?
Somebody, please help him!
I think my dad's gone crazy!

[Verse 1: Eminem, Hailie Jade & Dr. Dre]
There's no mountain I can't climb
There's no tower too high, no plane that I can't learn how to fly
What do I gotta do to get through to you
To show you there ain't nothin' I can't take this chainsaw to?
(Rahhnnn!) Fuckin' brains, brawn and brass balls
I cut 'em off and got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
Inside of a hall, with my framed autographed sunglasses
With Elton John's name on my drag wall
I'm out the closet, I've been lyin' my ass off
All this time, me and Dre been fuckin' with hats off
(Suck it, Marshall!) So tell Laura and her husband to back off
'Fore I push this motherfuckin' button and blast off
And launch one of these Russians, and that's all
Blow every fuckin' thing except Afghanistan on the map off
When will it stop? When will I knock the crap off?
(*Knocking*) Hailie, tell 'em, baby! (My dad's lost it!)

[Hook: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
There's really nothin' else to say, I, I can't explain it
I think my dad's gone crazy!
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em, maybe?
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's no one on Earth that can save me, not even Hailie
I think my dad's gone crazy! (Crazy)

[Verse 2: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
It's like my mother always told me:
"Rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana and codeine and
Goddamn it, you little motherfucker
If you ain't got nothin' nice to say, then don't say nothin'!"
Uh… Fuck that shit, bitch!
Eat a motherfuckin' dick, chew on a prick
And lick a million motherfuckin' cocks per second
I'd rather put out a motherfuckin' gospel record
I'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch
Eat pussy and have pussy lips glued to my face
With a clit ring in my nose, than quit bringin' my flows
Quit givin' me my ammo; can't you see why I'm so mean?
If y'all leave me alone this wouldn't be my M.O.
I wouldn't have to go eenee-meenee-meini-mo
Catch a homo by his toe, man, I don't know no more
Am I the only fuckin' one who's normal anymore? (Dad!)

[Hook: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
There's really nothin' else to say, I, I can't explain it
I think my dad's gone crazy!
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em, maybe?
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's no one on Earth that can save me, not even Hailie
I think my dad's gone crazy! (Crazy)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise
At the same time, can make you dry your eyes
With the same rhyme, see, what you're seein'
Is a genius at work, which to me isn't work
So it's easy to misinterpret it at first, ‘cause when I speak
It's tongue-in-cheek, I'd yank my fuckin' teeth
Before I'd ever bite my tongue, I'd slice my gums
Get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once
And die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son
And walk around the rest of my life spit on
And kicked and hit with shit every time I sung
Like R. Kelly as soon as "Bump and Grind" comes on
More pain inside of my brain, than the eyes of a little girl
Inside of a plane aimed at the World Trade
Standin' on Ronnie's grave, screamin' at the sky
'Til clouds gather; it's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade
And that's pretty much the gist of it
Parents are pissed, but the kids love it
9 millimeter heaters stashed in two-seaters with meat cleavers
I don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither

[Hook: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
There's really nothin' else to say, I, I can't explain it
I think my dad's gone crazy!
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell 'em, maybe?
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
I think my dad's gone crazy!
There's no one on Earth that can save me, not even Hailie
I think my dad's gone crazy! (Crazy)

[Outro: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
Crazy
Ha-ha-ha-ha ha-ha-ha-ha
You're funny, Daddy!

[Verse 1]
Uh, black hearts on my cardigan
At the crib tellin ya girl that we should order-in
Tell G to put his feet up on the ottoman
We just up against a bunch of rappers I go harder than
Damn! I'm so Catriona smarter than
A lot of these niggas swear the coach just brought the starter in
Yeah, and I'm the type to tell ya daughter things
I float high, don't try and cut my water wings
I'm still myself
Suicide bars, I kill myself
Charge it to the game, I bill myself
And I don't feel y'all, but I feel myself
Aunty Doe, tell 'em I deserve a mazel tov
I'm rappin' like a Shepherd with the muzzle off
I'm next to blow, pause
And I can't hear the critics talkin' over the applause {crowd cheers}
Yeah, I tried to tell 'em, Future let 'em know
Send the haters all my love, X and O
I got a black box where suggestions go
But I don't really give a fuck, it's prolly best you know
My reality is brighter than your dreams are
I got your dream girl ridin' in your dream car
Yeah, and the visual is stunnin'
I hope they document what I'm becomin'
Congratulations

[Verse 2]
So what you want an award or somethin'?
I'm at the private airport boardin' somethin'
I see nothing from afar but I'm far from nothing
Put on your poker face, I'll pull ya card if you're bluffin'
But I ain't with the hard talk
I got a monopoly, catch me on my boardwalk
Like I said we pull your card and find out you're a Hallmark
Just know I'm breakin' world records, no false start
I don't see your point unless it's gunpoint or somethin'
My deal like Weezy first week, one point somethin'
And my verses gettin' stupider
Wayne if you're on Mars, can you pick me up from Jupiter?
Phone blowin' up, so I'm cuttin' off my cellular
I'm a superstar, noted on to my nebula
I will break a leg, break an arm and a fibula
When I break it down, when I, when I break it down
I hug and kiss the drum kick
I put the beat in my back pocket and just sit
But, you could never beat my ass, pause
Again, dammit y'all, again
Y'all, pretend that we are, some men that get it on, and in
I'll die before I lose, 'cause I was born, to win
If he don't fuck with y'all, then don't bother him
And yes, I fuck this game but I won't father them
Right, uh

[Verse 3]
It's like, these days man, I'm booked and I'm busy
Dad named me Drake, Footz named me Drizzy
They tried to tell me I'd never be nothin' but a protege
But if you watched the VMAs, there's nothing more to say
I got the key to happiness and all the copies
Remember this day like you bought a poppy
And damn, how I get so nice?
I just spent it all once, 'bout to get rich twice
Surprise party bitch, now it's on and poppin'
I always choose dough like it's my only option
'Cause money always knows best
Chain snatch flow, they say "Get it off your chest"
And I'm what all the fuss about
And if they talkin', I bet I'm what they discussion 'bout
Hit me at the office, same extension
Consider me the reason y'all should pay attention

[Intro]
They told me this is a free country
But now it feels like a chicken factory
I feel cooped up, I wanna bust free;
Got nothing to lose if you get me

[Verse 1]
Like a Taliban trucker eating boiled-up yucca
Get my eyes done like I'm in a black burka
Been through shit, yeah it's a fucka'
But now I make tunes, say "shuck-a-lucka-lucka"
Shuck-a-lucka-la, shuck-a-lucka-lee
Shuck-a-lucka-lucka-lucka-lucky, lucky me
If you check me, I check you
If they kick you then I'll back you
Say something new, say something cool
Give you my time, but I ain't no fool
Eck-a-eck-a I, break-a-break-a jaw
Every-every time someone steps on my toe
I fight the ones that fight me

[Hook]
I really love a lot, I really love a lot
I really love a lot, I really love a lot
But I fight the ones that fight me
But I fight the ones that fight me
I fight the ones that fight me
But I fight
(Tell me fi 'quint, me nuh 'quint my eye
Nookie clean, nookie tight, and that's no lie)
But I fight
(Tell me fi 'quint, me nuh 'quint my eye
Nookie clean, nookie tight, and that's no lie)
But I fight
But I fight the ones that fight me

[Bridge]
Who's in town?
Them no like me, me no like them
Like Hu Jintao
Instead of them I got a new-found gem
Someone I can love up like men
Like Obama needs to love up Chen

[Verse 2]
Like a hand-me-down sucker throwing bombs out Mecca
Call the good will, get money to get better
Keep your head down like a Unicef worker
If you get hit you can't question the fucker
How come how come I? Yeah but yeah but why?
If I be the F, who the F be the I
If you met me then you'd get me
But if you get me will you get a fee
Shit's meant to be free, where's Bob Marley?
Cause I won't turn my cheek like I'm Gandhi
I fight the ones that fight me
I fight the ones that fight me

[Hook]
I really love a lot, I really love a lot
I really love a lot, I really love a lot
But I fight the ones that fight me
But I fight the ones that fight me
I fight the ones that fight me
But I fight
(Tell me fi 'quint, me nuh 'quint my eye
Nookie clean, nookie tight, and that's no lie)
But I fight
(Tell me fi 'quint, me nuh 'quint my eye
Nookie clean, nookie tight, and that's no lie)
But I fight
But I fight the ones that fight me

[Intro]
Yo, remember back on the Bully
When cats used to harmonize like (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
Yo, yo, my men and my women
Don't forget about the deen
Sirat al-Mustaqeem
Yo, it's about a thing, uh, yo, yo
If ya feel real good wave your hands in the air
And lick two shots in the atmosphere!
(Put them up, put them up)
(Put them up, put them up)
(Put them up, put them up)

[Verse 1]
It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?
You act like you ain't hear him then give him a little trim
To begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend
Like you wasn't down and you called him again?
Plus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again
Talking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian
A Muslim, sleeping with the jinn
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?
Showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem
Baby girl, respect is just a minimum
Niggas fucked up and you still defending 'em
Now, Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn
It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in
Look at where you be in, hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans
Come again
(A win win, come again
A win win, come again)

[Hook]
Guys, you know you'd better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

[Verse 2]
The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women
Him and his men come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend, poppin' yang (like you got yen!)
Let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by they waist men
Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement
The pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men
Need to take care of they three or four kids
And they face a court case when the child support late
Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky, silent men
The punk, domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
Uh-uh, come again (Yeah)
Hey, yo-yo, come again
My French men, come again
My sister, come again

[Bridge]
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out

[Hook]
Girls, you know you'd better watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing
Guys, you know you'd better watch out
'Cause girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

Girls, you know you’d better watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

[Skit/Outro]
Class!
Hey, we’ve got some very intelligent women here, man
Do you think you’re too young to really love somebody?
(No! No, no, I don’t think so)
I say it for me, uh, I’m an adult I say, wait
“You’re too young to be in love, this is silly
You’re infatuated or whatever, you got nice jeans
You wear fancy Adidas”
I mean, it might be something I don’t know
(It's the difference from loving somebody and being in love with somebody)
Well, you tell me. What’s the difference?
(Okay. You can love anybody but when you’re in love with somebody you’re looking at it like this—you’re taking that person for what he or she is no matter what he or she look like or no matter what he or she do)
(You’re crazy! You fall in love, you can fall out of love)
(You might stop being in love with them but you are not gonna stop loving that person)
(Maybe they ain’t never been loved before or been in love before, they don’t know what the feeling is to be loved)
(She poetic)
She killed it, we could end that conversation with that, right?

[Intro: Lupe Fiasco & Jonah Matranga]
Uh!
And he never lies
And he never lies
Uh, yeah!

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
He just sits, and watches the people in the boxes
Everything he sees, he absorbs and adopts it
Mmm, he mimics and he mocks it
Really hates the box, but he can't remember how to stop it
Uh, so he continues to watch it
Hoping that it'll give him something that he can box with
Or how to locksmith, see, the box is locked in a box
Ain't got the combination to unlock it
That's why he watches, scared to look away
Cause at that moment, it might show him
What to take off the locks with
So he chained himself to the box, took a lock and then he locked it
Swallowed the combination and then forgot it
As the doctors jot it all down with they pens and pencils
The same ones that took away his voice
And just left this instrumental like that

[Chorus: Jonah Matranga and Lupe Fiasco]
And he never lies (He never lies, he never lies, uh)
And he never lies (Uh, he never lies, he never lies, no)
And he never lies (He never lies)
Cause he never said anything at all

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
He just sits, and listens to the people in the boxes
Everything he hears, he absorbs and adopts it
Anything not coming out the box, he blocks it
See, he loves the box and hope they never stop it
Anything the box tell him to do, he does it
Anything it tell him to get, he shops and he cops it
He protects the box, locks it in a box
When he goes to sleep, but he never sleeps
Cause he stays up to watch it, scared to look away
Cause at that moment, it might get stolen
And that's the last of the boxes
So he chained himself to the box, took a lock and then he locked it
Swallowed the combination and then forgot, it
As the doctors jot it all down with they pens and pencils
The same ones that took away his voice
And just left this instrumental, like that

[Chorus: Jonah Matranga and Lupe Fiasco]
And he never lies (He never lies, he never lies, uh)
And he never lies (Uh, he never lies, he never lies, no)
And he never lies (He never lies)
Cause he never said anything at all

[Bridge: Lupe Fiasco & Jonah Matranga]
(Anything at all) He never lies
Uh, and you can't tell me just who you are
You buyin them clothes just to hide those scars
You built that roof just to hide those stars
Now you can't take it back to the start
And you can't tell me just who you are
You buyin them clothes just to hide those scars
You built that roof just to hide those stars
Now you can't take it back to the start

[Chorus: Jonah Matranga and Lupe Fiasco]
And he never lies (He never lies, he never lies, uh)
And he never lies (Uh, he never lies, he never lies, no)
And he never lies (He never lies)
Cause he never said anything at all

[Outro: Lupe Fiasco & Jonah Matranga]
(Anything at all, anything at all)
Uhh, and you can't tell me just who you are
You buy new clothes just to hide those scars
You built that roof just to hide those stars
Now you can't take it back to the start
And you can't tell me just who you are
You buy new clothes just to hide those scars
You built that roof just to hide those stars
Now you can't take it back to the start
(Anything at all, anything at all)
Uh, and you can't tell me just who you are
You buy new clothes just to hide those scars
You built that roof just to hide those stars
Now you can't take it back to the start
And you can't tell me just who you are
You buy new clothes just to hide those scars
You built that roof just to hide those stars
Now you can't take it back to the start

[Chorus]

Ride or die chick with a pocket full of relish (hey!)
Jimmy Choo fetish keep me fresh like lettuce
Bitches get jealous, cause I'm quite cocky
Since 14 ain't nann ho stop me
Money, I get it on the tracks I spit it
That's why the credit cards don't come with no limits (OHH!)
Y'all just don't get it, a crib with no tenants
Walk through closets like I'm walkin out of Lennox
Now that's Swagger on a hundred, thousand, trillion
Roll with bad bitches and they all look Brazilian
These niggas can't leave me, I swear they can't leave me
Ass so fat and the pussy like Fiji

[Verse 1: Robin Thicke & Lil Wayne]
I heard some shouts, like, "Down on the floor" (Baow)
Then even louder, "We got shooters" (Yeah), shooters (Yeah-yeah, yeah)
I turned around, I was starin' at chrome (Hello)
Shotgun watches door, got security good (Check)
Jumped right over counter, pointed gun at, wink
He tell her, "I'm your shooter, shooter, shooter" (Let's go)

[Chorus: Robin Thicke & Lil Wayne]
My hands up (Yeah), my hands up (Yeah)
They want me with my hands up (I think they), no (Think they want me)
Shooter (Surrender to 'em, but no, no, no, I can't do it)
My hands up, my hands up (Yeah)
They want me with my hands up (Come on, they want me to), no (Surrender)
Shooter (But no, I can't do it, get 'em, yeah)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
So many doubt 'cause I come from the South
But when I open up my mouth, all bullets come out, bang
Die, bitch nigga, die, I hope you bleed a lake
I'ma play X-ray, helpin' y'all see the fake
I'm just tryna be the great, tryna get a piece of cake
Take it off of your plate, eat it right in your face (Hah)
They got a whole lot to say, but I don't listen
Call me Automatic Weezy, bitch, I keep spittin', pow

[Bridge: Robin Thicke & Lil Wayne]
With all these bitches and all these bitches (Yeah)
But ain't no loaners around (What you say?)
They thinkin' 'bout shooters, they, shooters, they (Okay)
Guns, girls (Okay), ladies, get the guns (Okay), get the
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shooters (Okay, come on)

[Chorus: Robin Thicke & Lil Wayne]
My hands up
They want me with my hands up, no (I think they want me to surrender)
Shooter (Clap, y'all, no, no, but I'm not)
I just cry, "Mama, I tink dat," hey
"Me tink they want me to surrender"
Shooter (No, no, bang)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
And to the radio stations, I'm tired of bein' patient
Stop being rapper racists, region haters
Spectators, dictators, behind door dick takers, it's outrageous
You don't know how sick you make us
I wanna throw it up like chips in Vegas
But this is Southern, face it
If we too simple, then y'all don't get the basics

[Bridge: Robin Thicke & Lil Wayne]
Lady walks into a shotgun surprise (Yeah)
Dropped to her knees, saw her life 'fore her eyes (Okay)
He said, "Bitch is gonna get it, everybody gon' regret it" (Okay, why?)
"I'm your shooter" (Brrt)

[Chorus: Robin Thicke & Lil Wayne]
My hands up (Yeah), my hands up (Yeah)
They want me with my hands up, no (Yeah, hah)
Shooter (I tried tell you what I am, baby)
My hands up (Yeah), my hands up (Yeah)
They want me with my hands up, no (Sorry, but me can't surrender, me won't surrender)
Shooter (Me no pretender, no)

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Socks soakin' wet, I been running, y'all, I reload
Every hundred yards, I'm comin' forward
You better know me
Lil Wayne, just call me Lord, hard
Take pain like Tylenols, raw
Way past par, far
I'm some shit you never saw
I take you to the shootout, baby, win, lose, or draw, yeah
And then they ask who, when, where, how, and
My reply was simply, "Pow," c'mon

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Mama, I tink dat, hey
Me tink dey want me to surrender
No, no, I'm sayin'
Mama, I tink dat, hey
Me tink dey want me to surrender, no
No, no, me won't surrender, no
No, I promise no surrender
I got my burner
And I'm the shooter

[Intro]
Yeah it's young Khalifa man
Mr. Spacely
Everyone call me man
Taylor Gang or die
And this project is brought to you by
Champagne and paper planes too
Rostrum Records in this bitch
Taylor Gang, Heavy Hustle, Deal or No Deal
Yeah, bitch

[Verse 1]
I'm screaming fuck them niggas who hated
I'm money affiliated
Speculating me landing
Must have got me mistaken with lame niggas
Know you gon' get high as fuck
As long as the planes with you
Left that major situation alone
And became richer
People talking down
But see me I'm the same nigga
Leave your bitch around
We gon' drink the champagne with her
We don't touch the ground
See a cloud with my name it
Only e-z widers please
No cigars for me and my gang
Fool, I'm a legend in these streets
Cause how I do my thang
And don't wear the fitted
I got the city on my chain
Oh man, still they hate and talk smack
Knowing if I was gone
There'd be no throne to throw your rocks at
Cruise at maximum altitudes
I'm tryna top that
So in touch with the real
Them suckas tryna stop that
But I, live or let die, party get high
And tell them lames to deplane or let fly

[Hook]
Don't know what they hate for
I'm just gettin' my paper
Well, maybe they'll love me more when I'm gone
I don't wanna leave, but I need to, it's such a shame
They gon' miss this plane
They gon' miss this plane
They gon' miss this plane
They gon' miss this plane
I try to believe you
I don't wanna leave but I need to

[Verse 2]
Stuck alone in this wave race
Say I'm living too fast
Don't plan on changing my pace
Got one foot on the gas
There's never a need for brakes
Smoke e-z widers with hash
Fuck bitches from out of state
Valet bringing my cars
A waiter to bring me plates
Shrimp and filet mignon
We celebrate buying drinks
With a couple of broads
My niggas and who got love for me
It's lonely at the top
I'm tired of having company
Uh, so while you busy trying to fit in
I'mma stand out
And view my life through this lens
To see how it pans out
Substitute teacher ass niggas need a handout
Middle finger, screaming fuck them niggas who hated
I'm money affiliated
Pop another bottle, that chronic smoke integrated
Speculating me landing, must've got me mistaken
I'm speaking as the captain of the plane
You's a runner on the jet way
Fool

[Hook]
Don't know what they hate for
I'm just gettin my paper
Well, maybe they'll love me more when I'm gone
I don't wanna leave, but I need to, it's such a shame
They gon' miss this plane
They gon' miss this plane
They gon' miss this plane
They gon' miss this plane
I try to believe you
I don't wanna leave but I need to

[Intro]
Head, head, HeadBanga
Hello, what it be
To you and yours

[Verse 1]
Salutations to all, you can call me Cudi
Or Mr. Extravagant 'cause I'm getting my money
Way my doors are swayin', it's like a bird on wheels
You can come to Ohio and you can see how it feels
And this the premier of that new-new here
It's gonna take you beyond
Where a jet can't Lear
But all you gon' hear
Is somethin' crazy in fact
How I be burnin' the booth
We'll get you looser than Yak
Yep-yep, you got it right
Now don't get left
Get on your good foot
It's only right that you step
And keep boppin' to this shit unfamiliar
If your main line got time then I be drillin' her
I keep you in my realm
I keep you in the sound
I keep myself up high
Because the haze by the pound
And my imagination
You can look all over the nation
But they ain't see

[Hook]
You can look all over
But no, you'll never find
Hot shit like mine
Woop, it blow your mind
You can look all over
But no, you'll never find
Hot shit like mine
'Cause I provide
That new new

[Verse 2]
Salutations my niggas
I'm aware that I'm different
You can still keep it hood
While you're smokin' just listen
It don't matter your race
Just take a blunt to the face
And we all gon' rock
Got to keep up the pace
And them girls gon' twerk
Because the vibe is poppin'
As well as the bottles
Keep it rockin', don't stop 'em
At the Motel-8
We can park out front
Yeah the flow is unleaded
You sucka niggas will front
'Cause I'm Super-Cudder-Realistic-Leaner-Alidocius
And rap ferocious
I been coaching the league
I bobble head the public
If you love it, M dub it
Blood, sweat, and tears; homie, I'm made of it
Finish the class if you think nothing 'bout it
Tell 'em like grandpa, you don't know nothing 'bout it
Wear kicks once, then the Leaner come up out 'em
I been sayin' it, you was playin' him
Now you know

[Hook]
You can look all over
But no, you'll never find
Hot shit like mine
Woop, it blow your mind
You can look all over
But no, you'll never find
Hot shit like mine
'Cause I provide
That new new

[Verse 3]
What it be to my ladies
With the bodies that kill
We ain't boppin' on money
Fuck with me 'cause you real
See you shakin' it fast
On some Mystical shit
You could slap that nigga
If he call you a bitch
Yeah I see you with that
But you should be on this
It's that Henney and Coca-Cola
Come over and sit
Won't you tell me your name
Tell me where you be at
I know you know that them hot
But I don't wanna hear that
You see I aim for a check
Before I aim for sex
Niggas aim for death
They tryin' to fuck with the blessed
Ain't no fuckin' with amateurs
Run passed the novice
Sip hella lean
To see who talks the slowest
Ain't no stoppin' me at all
You'd need a sawed-off, or maybe a chainsaw
And even at that
The crack that I brew is still new
Y'all niggas think acute
But Cudi is obtuse

[Hook]
You can look all over
But no, you'll never find
Hot shit like mine
Woop, it blow your mind
You can look all over
But no, you'll never find
Hot shit like mine
'Cause I provide
That new new

All I have in this world, all I have in this world (What up, Blood?)
All I have in this world, all I have in this world

[Verse 1]
They know where Carter at, straight off the launchin' pad
Marchin' on the moon motherfucker, I been to Mars and back
Cleaner than laundry mats, jumpin' in somethin' from
Other countries, companies, junkie, you cannot order that
I flew that and took the water back, order, go to Iraq
And get a car with gas and tell them crackers, "War with that"
All I need is an automatic: tick, boom
I'm a goon, I go zoom; smell the fumes from the vrooms
Young Tune in the room, gimme room or you doomed
I am soon to get all my chips and doubloons
I would never be another groom unless I assume
The bitch ain't givin' up the womb to him and whom
M.O.B, let me bloom, let me boom
I pop early like firecrackers in the last week of June
I'm gettin' my lunch like noon, I gotta eat
Scarface with diamond teeth, haha!

[Hook]
On the for reala, my nigga, just call me Scarface
On the for reala, my nigga, just call me Scarface

Nobody know my name, they only know my face
(All I have in this world, all I have in this world)
On the for reala, my nigga, just call me Scarface

Nobody know my name, they only know my face
(All I have in this world, all I have in this world)
On the for reala, my nigga, just call me Scarface

[Verse 2]
Lord, protect me from my friends, I can take care of my enemies
I come from where the niggas just kill to save energy
Sorry world, but my mommy dropped me where the clinic be
So if you tried to mimic me, you'd prob'ly catch some sick disease
Six degrees, leanin' on that prometha-tha-tha-thazine
I'm a centipede, these men move at women speed
I'm 'bout my spinach, cheese, dough, cheddar, fetti, gwap
Money, moolah, mozzarella, et cetera, et cetera
Fuck competitors, fuck these rappers, fuck these editors
Fuck the head of the state, fuck the gates surroundin' the prisoners
These motherfuckers the prey; I'm the Predator, see me dreadlock
Tough as Bamm-Bamm from Bedrock
I'm tied to the game like wedlock, say "Hello red dot"
Say "Goodbye life" and say "Hello Satan"
A devil in the flesh, a rebel at its best, no complainin'
We live in Hell and I'm blessed, Scarface

[Hook]
On the for reala, my nigga, just call me Scarface
On the for reala, my nigga, just call me Scarface
(All I have in this world, all I have in this world)
On the for reala, my nigga, just call me Scarface

Devour any cowards, sours slippery at the lip
Beast up, suck up to none, don't be no sucker

Candy so sweet, got everybody eatin' it
Bigg Snoop Dogg, I'm the star of this
So gone on and get yourself a bar of this
No change man.. gimme the bucks
The kinda candy I sell they call it deez nutz
(Deez nuts!) I'm almond with the caramel insides
European front end with the french fries
How it feel man? What it look like?
I'm in your neighborhood, pullin on some Bud Light
Sweet and sticky, take it out the wrapper
Now put it in your mouth
To the beat of the drum, it'll be fun
And I bet you can't just eat one (Candy!)

I'm in the hood with the six-trey candy paint
Lil' somethin to chunk, make the hoes all faint
If you know when to beep, jump my baby rate
When I grip round her butt, I hold her steady
G-yeah.. she my one and only
Quick to keep back haters who don't know me
I... feel... good about candy (Candy!)
My gangstas understand me

[Verse 4: Goldie Loc]
Shake it baby, don't break it baby, now can you make it clap?
(Clap!) Tryna fit this work in your gap (gap!)
Drop it like it water pagoda, get my hustle on
I get it from you then I step on you to bubble on

Here come that sugar daddy, black, rollin on gold thangs
Fo'shigiddy, he turned it into somethin, boy

"It's like candy, candy!" Get it how you want it
Whip it, twist it, pop your whip up on the corner
Voila, taadow, check out this bizarre
The D-A-T the N-I double G, the D-A-Z
Again it's up in the wind, feel the breeze for shit
God damn! You already know who I am
Chrome on chrome, blue on blue, frost colors switches
Hit the gas, hit the brake, y'all really burn rubber?
Dip, drop, drop, dip
Stop, dip, ghost ride the whip!

[Verse 6: Kurupt]
Yeah, nigga, shot caller
It's America's number one baller

So I'm back on my grizzle like a bearskin rug
Plus I'm laying on the floor, blame it on the Go
Little rapper turn it out because I'm very plugged
I convert, I can work anywhere in the world
You can ask my brother Hugg
He'll concur that I'm serious with the words
To the man up above, thank you very much
That I got what I got and I'm at where I'm at
Like an "a" in a circle, with a pay, lil Urkel
What they say when they see lil G
From the F to the F with the amazing verbals
While they race in a circle like they racing a gerbil
I race in a circle like I'm racing a horse
I'm racing a Porsche, while they racing in place
They race in a cage, I race on a course
'Course, that case in the court did not defer the dream
I am still a raisin in the sun, raging against the machine

Like hey, hey I'm the boss, rock Junya Watanabe Lacoste
Beyond clean, in phenom jeans, little rap Isaac Asimov
I let my momma in the rhyming that she raised me off
A 80s baby on fire like a safety off
Got my hood riding higher than some 28s
Off of everything I spoke like a 84
And they in love with him and I'm in love with them
And we'll never ride dubs again, no we won't
Trying to get Above the Rim
A little too short to dunk, so we donk

Sometimes I feel lost like a runaway, read over the dire
Reap while I stay gettin Richard like Pryor
Need to put the gun away cause I got priors
It's hard to stay rollin when the world full of riders
Bullet tip on fire, flyin down sunset
Motivated to win, like I ain't won yet
Think shit over? Hell naw I ain't done yet
I L-B-see y'all prayin that a G fall
Tonight it's goin down like free fall
Chevy bouncin up and down like a fuckin see-saw
Trippin off hate, no Hee-Haw
All blacks locs on the loc actin like I don't see y'all
Doing that shit to demean Dogg
But when I bring it to you, you be like "What you mean Dogg?"
Then we go back and forth, like it's ping-pong
Knowin I should just ring ya bell, ding dong!
But that's one thing about this shit partner
Every move is so watched by these rich boxers
So why should I lose all my rich sponsors?
I'm gone then you suddenly hip-hoppin?
Sheeit, sip the gin then I'm in the wind
Pop a beam like a M&M
So strong yet a nigga thin
Rappers stay sayin Slim so Shady but ain't talkin Eminem
So fuck you, him, and him
I was gangbangin befo' a nigga entered in
No facade, I went from the yard
To a three-car garage to, instant menage it's
Vintage, relentless, I mean this, I promise
No Suge, No Dre, I'da did this regardless
And thats what I'm supposed to think
Flinch at me like I'm supposed to blink
Motherfucker this Crip still, hard to swallow like a big pill
Pushin 40's still a big deal
Ponytail still swangin, hair still braided
Laker to a Clipper I won't be faded
Nigga! So buzz on that shit
Backflip back to plaque shit
Blue red white to black shit, but for the green
I send a whole motherfuckin team to clap shit
React to mack shit, problem, terrorist
Fuck this rap shit!

[Outro]
Shots fired
Suspect down

[Hook]
Somebody remind me where I am
That's right I’m at home, yeah I’m right where I belong
Girl you say you feeling faded yeah me too
This smoke is getting blown, and these drinks are super strong
I know they ain't getting money like we do
So it’s on
I was looking for the one
Now I’m feeling dumb for thinking it was you
I was wrong
Now I’m back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it
And I’mma do it all
Feeling like the old me
You don’t even know me
I’mma do it all
I’mma do it all
That's probably why I’m back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it

[Verse 1]
Tonight I’m into breaking up
Somebody’s home
I’m drunk as ever
I’m not alone
I-I-I-I’m with my people
I know you love it
I don’t just do it
I over does it
I be getting money so long
It's just paper to me
Take all my memories with you and just erase it for me
You can never reminisce when you forget it all
Careful what you wish for, you just might get it all
Now my life is angel hair and pinot grigio
Baby, forget about it
I'm headed wherever this motherfucking jet is routed
You can’t have my heart the doctor told me I’d be dead without it
My judgment's never cloudy
That’s why I’m steady yelling weatherman, weatherman
I’m about whatever man
I’m tryna fuck with Tinkerbell in Never Neverland
But I’m polite about it
Baby, after you
I’ve had a glass or two so

[Hook]
Somebody remind me where I am
That's right I’m at home, yeah I’m right where I belong
Girl you say you feeling faded yeah me too
This smoke is getting blown, and these drinks are super strong
I know they ain't getting money like we do
So it’s on
I was looking for the one
Now I’m feeling dumb for thinking it was you
I was wrong
Now I’m back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it
And I’mma do it all
Feeling like the old me
You don’t even know me
I’mma do it all
I’mma do it all
That's probably why I’m back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it

[Verse 2]
Tryna get the green like I’m waiting at a long light
Broke just doesn’t suit me girl and every night is prom night
Where’d I put my bow tie
Millionaire, multi
Rest in peace to B.I.G. and praises to the most high
Getting stupid paid off of smart decisions
I’m the man now, I guess that part's a given
So someone please tell me the problem with my competition
I ask what's up and they just always say the cost of living
I learn from it though, I’ve been down and I got up
Bring a hundred thousand to the club and light your spot up
And me falling and landing in love I don't think should happen
'Cause everything's easier to get into than get out of
But someone show me to the owner of this city
Because the owners always seem to be the only people with me
I’m still the mafia, I still run the committee
N.Y. forever nigga, Diddy

[Hook]
Somebody remind me where I am
That's right I’m at home, yeah I’m right where I belong
Girl you say you feeling faded yeah me too
This smoke is getting blown, and these drinks are super strong
I know they ain't getting money like we do
So it’s on
I was looking for the one
Now I’m feeling dumb for thinking it was you
I was wrong
Now I’m back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it
And I’mma do it all
Feeling like the old me
You don’t even know me
I’mma do it all
I’mma do it all
That's probably why I’m back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it

[Instrumental Outro]

[Intro]
This is why I do this shit
I think they call this "venting"

[Verse 1]
Look, this is me, still the same
They want the hits, I play the game
No auto-tune, but you can feel the pain
It all comes spilling out like I hit a vein
What up, Lil Bro? What up, Slum Ville?
I hope you know that y'all the reason I have fun still
The fans thinking that we all signed for one mil
Equal opportunity rapping, that shit is unreal
That ain't how it works, that ain't how it goes
And I been getting high just to balance out the lows
And I could use a writer just to balance out my flows
But I never share my thoughts, this is all a nigga knows
And every time I try, it opens up my eyes
These verses are a chance to be remembered and reprised
And I would be performing this as long as I'm alive
So every word I utter will be mine

[Chorus]
Don't believe the lies, look me in my eyes
Please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
I remember you, this feeling isn't new
So please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me

[Verse 2]
(Don't take this the wrong way but, uh)
I never cried when Pac died
But I probably will when Hov does
And if my tears hold value then I would drop one
For every single thing he showed us
And I'll be standing in a puddle
I stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble
And I'ma keep it honest, I'm so tired of being subtle
It's just me, 40, O, and Nik standing in a huddle
Staring at the members of my team
Who get questioned 'bout they profit from this million dollar scheme
Just know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams
I hope you tell your families this shit ain't what it seems
But y'all the reason for a lot of my devotion
You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless
And know I pop bottles 'cause I bottle my emotions
At least I put it all in the open

[Chorus]
Don't believe the lies, look me in my eyes
Please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
I remember you, this feeling isn't new
So please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me

[Verse 3]
Look, fuck all y'all, we ignore feelings here
Premature millionaires, welcome to my realest year
Yeah, I swear that we making a killing here
I should be on top of the world just chilling here
But it's funny having fans
Who find you before anybody ever has the chance
And build you up, so you could be the biggest in the game
And realize when you're there, sometimes the shit don't feel the same
Yeah, and plus things are just surreal at home
People think I've changed just 'cause my appeal has grown
And now security follow me everywhere
So I never actually am alone, I just always feel alone
I think I'm scared of what the future holds
I was wishing for some things and now am used to those
Every girl I meet thinks I'm fucking groupie hoes
The honesty of my music has left me too exposed
All my old friends think I got a new crowd
And people seem to notice every time I do smile
I guess that mean they come few and far between
Even though I'm living out what you would call the dream
And my uncle ain't even messaging me
And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me
I hope this isn't one of those forever things
It's funny how money can change everything

[Chorus]
Don't believe the lies, look me in my eyes
Please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
I remember you, this feeling isn't new
So please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me

[Verse 1]
Yeah
It's Hirst verses and Murakami rhyming
All my raps is superflat, all your raps is super wack
Tell him that the future's back, DeLorean rolling down the block
You can call it shooting craps, and my roof is back
And my wings is up
Kingda Ka without Kahlua, so you ain't got to pour the king a cup
Young Yakuza but, none of my fingers cut
So I can still sip Red Zinger with my pinkies up
Made man, you can call this cleaning up
I'm OCD, I never think it's clean enough
That's what defines me, I never think it's mean enough
Lines deeper than those waiting on a sneaker, cuz
You gone need two heads like the King of Clubs just to figure out the meaning of
I'm just achieving buzz, so stay out of son way like you're drinking blood
This is what it feels like to be in love

[Verse 2]
I mean come on, I mean look at what I'm dropping here
Do this for the block and the blogosphere
No, you ain't ready for the heavy, so I'll keep it light as jogging gear
I don't want the throne, I want the helicopter rocking chair
Jay gave me a co-sign like I was RocaWear, but be clear I'm not the heir
I'm the water, fire and the earth
That means I'm doing dirt, spitting flames and quenching thirst
And plus the real God has been on my side since birth
I hope that he forgives me, I hope I do his work in every single verse
Now I might do a dance, I might even jerk, tell them niggas don't hate
Only God is great, Enemy Of The State

[Intro: Kanye West & Young Jeezy]
La, la, la la (Yeah)
Wait 'til I get my money right

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven
When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man, it's so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given, much is tested
Get arrested, guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what I do? Act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry, more Louis V
My mama couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel, man
I ain't one of the Cosbys, I ain't go to Hillman
I guess the money should've changed him
I guess I should've forgot where I came from

[Chorus: Kanye West & Young Jeezy]
La, la, la la (Ayy!)
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la la (Yeah!)
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing (Yeah! Haha!)
You can't tell me nothing (Yeah! Yeah!)
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing (Yeah!)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Let up the suicide doors
This is my life, homie, you decide yours
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldn't tell ya who decide wars
So I parallel double-parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking 'bout, "Back in my day"
But homie, this is my day
Class started two hours ago, oh, am I late?
No, I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh, they so sensitive
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
And say something when you gon' end up apolog'ing
Let me know if it's a problem then
Aight, man, holla, then

[Chorus: Kanye West & Young Jeezy]
La, la, la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la la (Yeah!)
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past
He don't even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors
He can drive off of fumes 'cause
How he move in a room full of no's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure, what's your pleasure?
Life is a–uh–depending how you dress her
So if the Devil wear Prada, Adam Eve wear nada
I'm in between, but way more fresher
With way less effort
'Cause when you try hard, that's when you die hard
Your homies looking like, "Why, God?"
When they reminisce over you, my God

[Chorus: Kanye West & Young Jeezy]
La, la, la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing

[Outro: Kanye West & Young Jeezy]
La, la, la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
(I'm serious, nigga, I got money)

[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah, look

[Verse 1: Eminem]
If I were to rap about the crap that's out
That's the route you probably want me to take
‘Cause you're just dyin' to know what I think
Hear my take on some other rappers
If I was to say somethin' about Paul Wall
You'd probably crap in your pants, ‘cause I'm white and he's white
So he's like my competition, I mean, right?
Nope! Paul Wall is dope, and so is Bubba
So bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-but, I don't compete with nobody
I just go hard, do the rope-a-dope Ali shuffle
And dance around my opponents, do donuts
Sometimes I play possum, like I'm asleep, it's awesome
I'm like a sleepin' giant, and when I awake I'm like Dre
I just jump from outta nowhere and bite prey
And sink my teeth in 'em, and fill 'em
Full of poison, and make a noise like a snake before I kill 'em
And let 'em know that I just don't feel 'em
And smack 'em with the backward E, the Eminem emblem
I was taught if you gonna murder somebody you should face him
Tell him why, look him dead in the eye, then waste him
And the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell
Then swallow the shell, all the hollow who dwell
In the shadows of all who are willing to sell their souls
For this rap game and it g-g-goes
One-two-three, chk-chk, one-two-three
Chk-chk, one-two-three, that ain't the hook, now follow me
There's nothing else for me to say, my public adores me
Everybody bores me, they're just so corny
So at night before I sleep, I look in the mirror
The mirror grows lips and it whispers: "Come nearer!"

[Chorus: Eminem]
My darling, I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling
‘Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling
‘Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

[Verse 2: Eminem]
"Shady, I know you're in there somewhere, come here!
Talk to me, sit! Here, pull up a chair!
Why don't you cut your hair?
Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Dye it back, come on, try it!"
Ahh, no! I told you, leave me the fuck alone, will you?
"But I'm here to rebuild you," — but I already killed you!
"But Shady, we were meant for each other
Think about your mother," — yeah, so what of her?
"You think about what she did to you and your little brother
All them foster homes," — fuck you, motherfucker!
I had you beat! — "No, I was playin' possum
Remember? I let you watch your little girls blossom
I gave you enough time, your soul's mine
I'm taking it back," — you fuckin' bitch, why?!
"Because I love you, look a little closer
Isn't that us on that poster? Ha-ha-ha-ha!"

[Chorus: Eminem]
My darling, I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling
‘Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my darling
‘Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body

[Verse 3: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
"Shady, listen! (Shady!) You hear that?
They're screaming for you, I can bring your career back!"
But I don't want it back — "Yes, you do," — no, I don't
"Yes, you do! You're gonna regret it later," — no, I won't
"I'ma get Dre on the phone, I'll just call the Doctor"
Go ahead, I already talked to Dre yesterday
"Well, I got him on the phone right now!"
(Slim!) You're lying! (Yo, Slim!) How, why now?
What up, Dre? (Check this out, Slim, I gotta talk to you
I don't know, it just seems like ever since you got off your
Drugs you became a lot softer)
But Dre, all Shady is, is a bottle of hair bleach and vodka
(Well, just think about it, Slim, I'm here
Just hit me back and let me know what's up) — fuck this mirror!
"I'm not in the mirror, I'm inside you
Let me guide you," — fuck you! Die, you son of a bitch!
"Put the gun down!" — bye-bye! Boom!
Okay, I'm still alive, — "So am I too!
You can't kill a spirit even if you tried to
Ha-ha, you sold your soul to me, need I remind you?
You remember that night you prayed to God
You'd give anything to get a record deal? Well, Dre signed you
This is what you wanted your whole life, Marshall, right? Ooh
Look at this house, look at these cars: they're so nice, woo!
Oh, but you didn't know fame has a price too?
That you just now seeing the downside to
Lose your best friend from high school, your wife too
Ain't even sure if your kids like you
Come off tour, can't even sleep at night without NyQuil
Become a Valium addict, start a rehab cycle
But together we can break the cycle
Marshall…" — What?! — "No one's gonna love you like I do"
*Chainsaw starting up*

[Chorus: Eminem]
My darling, I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
‘Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
‘Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
(I said) I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together, my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
‘Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body (your body, your body, your body, your body)

[Chorus: Matthew Santos & Lupe Fiasco]
If you are what you say you are (Yeah, yeah) a superstar (Gon' say now)
Then have no fear, the camera's here (Ugh)
And the microphones
And they wanna know-oh-oh-oh (The return)
If you are what you say you are, a superstar (What)
Then have no fear, the crowd is here (Yeah!)
And the lights are on (Haaa!)
And they want a show-oh-oh-oh, yeah (Free Chilly!)

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah! Ugh! a fresh cool young Lu'
Trying to cash his microphone check, 2-1-2
Wanna believe my own hype, but it's too untrue
The world brought me to my knees, what have you brung? You?
Did you improve on the design, did you do something new?
Well, your name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?
You! The more famous person you come through
And the sexy lady next to you—you come too
And then it hit me—standing outside of Heaven
Waiting for God to come and get me: I'm too uncouth
Unschooled to the rules and too gumshoe
Too much of a newcomer and too uncool
Like Shadow and Lavelle, I battle with it well
Though I need a holiday like lady who sung "Blue"
Go back, whatever you did you undo
Heavy as heaven, the devil on me, two tons too
Ha, ha, ha, ha-ha-ha

[Chorus: Matthew Santos]
If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones
And they wanna know-oh-oh-oh, yeah

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
And you better wear your shades
The spotlights here can burn holes through the stage
Down through the basement, past the Indian graves
Where the dinosaurs laid and (Pyoom!)
Out through China, nearly misses airliners
Magnified times five, this was pointed at the rhymer
Ricochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze (Woo!)
Now, that's important to say
'Cause even with all that, most of us don't want it to faaaade
We want it to braid
Meaning, we want it to grow, meaning we want it to stay
Like the governor called, and he told him to wait
Unstrap him from the chair, and put him back in his caaaage
The audience ain't fazed
And they ain't gon' clap, and they ain't gon' praise (Ugh)
They want everything back (Back) that they've paid
'Cause they've been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim
Ha, ha, ha, ha-ha-ha

[Chorus: Matthew Santos]
If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show-oh-oh-oh, yeah

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
So, chauffeur, chauffeur, come and take me away
'Cause I've been standing in this line for, like, five whole days
Me and security ain't getting along, and when I got to the front
They told me all of the tickets were gone
So just take me home where the mood is mellow
And the roses are thrown, M&Ms are yellow
And the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker
Everybody gets a nice autograph picture
One for you and one for your sister
Who had to work tonight but is an avid listener
Every song's her favorite song; and mics don't feedback
All the reviewers say, "You need to go and see that"
And everybody claps, 'cause everybody is pleased
And then, they all take the stage and start performing for me
Like, "Ha, ha, ha-ha-ha"
"Ha, ha, ha-ha-ha, ha"

[Chorus: Matthew Santos & Lupe Fiasco]
If you are what you say you are, a superstar
Then have no fear, the camera's here
And the microphones
And they wanna know-oh-oh-oh
If you are what you say you are, a superstar (Superstar!)
Then have no fear, the crowd is here
And the lights are on
And they want a show-oh oh oh (Yeah)

[Outro: Matthew Santos]
If you are
What you say you are
Then have no fear

[Intro]
Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were
Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were

[Verse 1]
Old man, look at my life
Twenty-four, and there's so much more
Live alone in a paradise
That makes me think of two
Love lost, such a cost
Give me things that don't get lost
Like a coin that won't get tossed
Rolling home to you

[Chorus]
Old man, take a look at my life
I'm a lot like you
I need someone to love me
The whole day through
Ah, one look in my eyes
And you can tell that's true

[Verse 2]
Lullabies, look in your eyes
Run around the same old town
Doesn't mean that much to me
To mean that much to you
I've been first and last
Look at how the time goes past
But I'm all alone at last
Rolling home to you

[Chorus]
Old man, take a look at my life
I'm a lot like you
I need someone to love me
The whole day through
Ah, one look in my eyes
And you can tell that's true

[Outro]
Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were
Old man, look at my life
I'm a lot like you were

Sex room, room, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Hah, welcome to my little sanctuary
You been lookin' so good all day
And you really got a nigga pretty anxious ba-by
Better call your boss, tell him that your daddy's home
Take a couple days off and take it off
And leave nothin' but yo' T-shirt and your panties on
Feelin' high but I'm hung real low, lookin' sorta like a tri-pod
So power down your cell phone, and power up your iPod
Power down your inhibitions, and power up your inner freak
Yes, yeah fuck, is the only words that you finna speak
It's about to get real X-rated, can you handle what I'm 'bout to do?
But enough about me, let me think should I be worryin' about if I can handle you?
Damn right I'ma get that thang and I'ma put my name on it
All night I'ma whip that thang, Allstate better put a claim on it
I claim my territory, my tongue finna mark you up
You could be my firecracker, my tongue finna spark you up
Get ready for blast-off, waterfalls gon' splash off
You might lose around four or five pounds so get ready to sweat your ass off

[Hook: Trey Songz]

My arm underneath your leg, legs all behind your head is how I gots to getcha
Right hand, left hand on red in the bed like we been playin' Twister
Now I got you tangled up, and you caught all in my web
Should I let you loose? Nah, I think I'll get the blindfold instead
You better get a couple towels baby 'cause we about to slip and slide
You don't ever need a horse or a saddle, I'ma give you this dick to ride
I'ma grant your every wish, and fulfill your fantasy
Ain't nobody else allowed in the sex room, it's only you and me

[Intro: Frogg]
Woah, a-get yo' hands in the air
And get to clappin' 'em and, like, back and forth
Because a-this is what you thought it wasn't
It be's the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O, the double G
And check out my man, he goes by the name of, um, er-

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M-80, you little like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit yo' style from
You ain't gon' sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin' out in the open
I'm doin' acid, crack, smack, coke, and smokin' dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi, Marshall)
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet 'cause I'm comin' up quick to strip yo' cash
Bought a ticket to yo' concert just to come and whip yo' ass
Bitch, I'm comin' out swingin' so fast it'll make yo' eyes spin
You gettin' knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson (Pssh)
The proof is in the puddin', just ask DeShaun Holton
I'll slit yo' motherfuckin' throat worse than Ron Goldman

[Chorus: Eminem]
So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks
Screamin', "Fuck the world" like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck)
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack (I just don't give a fuck)
So put my tape back on the rack, go run and tell your friends
My shit is wack (I just don't give a fuck)
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
('Cause I just don't give a fuck)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milkbone
I'm everlastin', I melt vanilla ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's 20 below freezin'
Flavor with no seasoning, this is the sneak preview
I'll diss yo' magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make yo' freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is lyrical combat, gentlemen, hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, M&M was the old initials (Bye-bye)
Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion
Pathological liar, blowin' shit outta proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin' yo' dead body inside of a fuckin' trash can
With more holes than an afghan

[Chorus: Eminem]
So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks
Screamin', "Fuck the world" like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck)
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack (I just don't give a fuck)
So put my tape back on the rack, go run and tell your friends
My shit is wack (I just don't give a fuck)
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you finna get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
('Cause I just don't give a fuck)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Somebody let me out this limousine (Hey, let me out)
I'm a caged demon
On stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend
Shootin' up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain-dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin' a jewel, I'm flippin' a sacred treasure
I'll bite yo' motherfuckin' style just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin' bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes
In school, I never said much, too busy havin' a head rush
Doin' too much rush, had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, ***** the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke, I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
I'm goin' up over the curb, drivin' on the median
Finally made it home but I don't got the key to get in

[Chorus: Eminem]
So when you see me on yo' block with two Glocks
Screamin', "Fuck the world" like 2Pac (I just don't give a fuck)
Talkin' that shit behind my back, dirty mackin'
Tellin' your boys that I'm on crack (I just don't give a fuck)
So put my tape back on the rack, go run and tell your friends
My shit is wack (I just don't give a fuck)
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you finna get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
('Cause I just don't give a fuck)

[Outro: Eminem]
(Shit, fuck everybody)
Outsiderz, Pacewon, Young Zee (Fuck the entire world)

[Intro]
A lot of people ask me, am I afraid of death?
Hell yeah, I'm afraid of death
I don't want to die yet
A lot of people think that I worship the Devil
That I do all types of retarded shit
Look, I can't change the way I think
And I can't change the way I am
But if I offended you, good
'Cause I still don't give a fuck

[Verse 1]
I'm zonin' off of one joint, stoppin' the limo
Hopped in the window, shoppin' a demo at gunpoint
A lyricist without a clue, what year is this?
Fuck a needle, here's a sword, body pierce with this
Livin' amuck, never givin' a fuck
Give me the keys, I'm drunk, and I've never driven a truck
But I smoke dope in the cab
I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab
Come back the next week and re-open your scab (Yeah)
A killer instinct runs in the blood
Emptyin' full clips and buryin' guns in the mud
I've calmed down now, I was heavy once into drugs
I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
My brain's gone, my soul's worn, my spirit is torn
The rest of my body's still bein' operated on
I'm ducked the fuck down while I'm writin' this rhyme
'Cause I'm probably gonna get struck with lightnin' this time

[Chorus]
For all the weed that I've smoked, yo, this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
To all the friends I used to have, I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, yo, I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
For every time I reminisce, yo, I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass

[Verse 2]
I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
And cut you so fast, when your blood spilled, it was still blue
I'll hang you 'til you dangle, and chain you with both ankles
And pull you apart from both angles
I wanna crush your skull 'til your brains leak out of your veins
And bust open like broken water mains
So tell Saddam not to bother with makin' another bomb
'Cause I'm crushin' the whole world in my palm
Got your girl on my arm, and I'm armed with a firearm
So big my entire arm is a giant firebomb
Buy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron-on
And the pants to match ("Here, Momma, try 'em on")
I get imaginative with a mouth full of adjectives
A brain full of adverbs, and a box full of laxatives
(Shittin' on rappers) Causing hospital accidents
God help me, before I commit some irresponsible acts again

[Chorus]
For all the weed that I've smoked, yo, this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
For all the friends I used to have, I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, yo, I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
For every time I reminisce, yo, I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass

[Verse 3]
I wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it
Spent a million a track and went over my budget (Oh shit)
Now, how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt?
I can't rap anymore, I just murdered the alphabet
Drug sickness got me doin' some bugged twitches
I'm withdrawin' from crack so bad my blood itches
I don't rap to get the women, fuck bitches
Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
Never ran with a clique, I'm a posse
Kamikaze, strappin' a motherfuckin' bomb across me
From the second I was born, my momma lost me
I'm a cross between Manson, Esham and Ozzy
I don't know why the fuck I'm here in the first place
My worst day on this Earth was my first birthday
Retarded? What did that nurse say?
Brain damage? Fuck, I was born durin' an earthquake

[Chorus]
For all the weed that I've smoked, yo, this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
To all the friends I used to have, yo, I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done, yo, I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended, yeah, fuck you too
For every time I reminisce, I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass

[Intro]
Yo, check it out
It's fucked up
'Cause I don't see either one of us budging

[Verse 1]
"I'm withholdin' my anger though I'd like to be the strangler
Of this punk ass little pussy's puny neck
It's my right to insist that he acknowledge my existence
But he just displays complete lack of respect"
That's what he says to himself as he uses his magazines to trash me
As he sits with both his feet up at his desk
Smokes a bag of his weed and starts imaginin' things
And he just can't see that he's manically depressed
And in his jealousy and envy, it just whirls him in a frenzy
As he turns on MTV and sees my face
He don't exist in this world so he just twists and he twirls
Spirals and spins 'til he hurls himself into a rage
And it's destroyin' him slowly 'cause he does not even know me
Even though he sees me everywhere he goes
So he just tortures himself, he has no fortune and wealth
So he extorts someone else to get his dough
And now he's actin' like a bully so he tries to push and pull me
But he knows that he can't fool me so he's mad
And he has no choice but to scream and raise his voice up at me
'Cause it annoys him to see that I ain't scared

[Chorus]
You ain't no motherfuckin' bully
And I ain't bowin' to no motherfuckin' bully
I won't allow it, ain't gon' cower to no bully
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a bully
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully
And I know it must be fuckin' wit' you emotionally

[Verse 2]
Now I'm not tryin' to make no more enemies, no more unfortunately
There's so many other motherfuckers there just are
They just keep houndin' at me now that I'm down with 50
Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja (Ha-ha-ha-ha)
But his ass is such a puppet, Irv could shove his whole hand up it
And just make him say what he wants him to say
But Suge has Irv on a string and Irv's so nervous that he
Says anything to this man to keep him at bay
So now Ja thinks that he's so tough and Murder Inc.'s the big bad wolf
And they go huff and puff and blow our label down
But our building's made out of bricks so you ain't takin' out shit
And, dawg, you just did a song with Bobby Brown
So now you try to pull the race card and it backfires in your face hard
'Cause you know we don't play that black and white shit
Plus this stylist you fucked when you was ecstasied up
Was just a man who's dressed up as a white bitch

[Chorus]
You ain't no motherfuckin' bully
And I ain't bowin' to no motherfuckin' bully
I won't allow it, ain't gon' cower to no bully
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a bully
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully
You must be takin' too much E

[Verse 3]
Now what bothers me the most about hip-hop is we're so close
To pickin' up where we left off with Big and Pac
We just lost Jam Master J, Big L got blasted away
Plus we lost Bugz, Slang Ton, and Freaky Tah
It's like a never-ending cycle that just seems to come full circle
Everybody's gotta be so fuckin' hard
And I'm not excludin' myself 'cause I been stupid as well
I been known to lose it when someone says something smart
But as we grow as men, we learn to let shit go, but then again
There's only so much bullshit we can really stand
We all got reps to uphold when someone steps on our toes
It's no exception, it goes for every man
But if Irv really gave a fuck about Ja like he claims he does
He'd wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs
But he just keeps feedin' him pills so if that E doesn't kill him
Someone from G-Unit will and I ain't buzzed
Dawg, I'm talkin' to you straight if the situation escalates
Any worse, we're gonna lose another soldier to this game
And if I get killed for this rap, I got a million in cash
That says I will get you back in Hailie's name

[Chorus]
You ain't no motherfuckin' bully
And I ain't bowin' to no motherfuckin' bully
I won't allow it, ain't gon' cower to no bully
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a bully
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully
Irvine, get your boy off of that E

[Outro]
Get at me, dawg
Holla

[Verse: Drake]
Why do I feel so alone?
Like everybody passing through the studio
Is in character as if he acting out a movie role
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know
And I don't have the heart
To give these bitch niggas the cue to go
So they stick around kicking out feedback
And I entertain it as if I need that
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that
My privacy about the only thing I need back, but
It's hard to think of them polite flows
When Stefano Pilati suits are your night clothes
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows
Life was so full, now this shit just being lipo'd
Always said I'd say it all on the right track
But in this game you only lose when you fight back
Black diamond bracelets, showing you the basics
I can't live and hold the camera, someone gotta tape this
And make hits like a bitch that's married, I ain't miss
24 hours from greatness, I'm that close
Don't ever forget the moment you began to doubt
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out
Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South
Watchin' Hov's show, embarrassed to pull my camera out
And my mother embarrassed to pull my Phantom out
So I park about five houses down
She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown
But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around
So she wonder where my mind is, accounts in the minus
But yet I'm rolling round the fuckin' city like your highness
Got niggas reactin' without a sinus
'Cause what I'm working with is timeless
And promoters try to get me out to they club
And say I have fun but I can't imagine how
'Cause I just seen my ex-girl, standing with my next girl
Standing with the girl that I'm fuckin' right now
And shit could get weird unless they all down
And so I stay clear, we from a small town
And everybody talks and everybody listen
And somehow the truth just always comes up missing
I've always been something that these labels can't buy
Especially if they tryin' to take a piece of my soul
And Sylvia be tellin' Tez, "Damn, Drake fly"
And he just be like, "Silly motherfucker, I know
That was your bad, how could you pass up on 'em?
He just take them records and he gas up on 'em
Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on 'em
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em"
Oh, they did, Po, at least they tried to
And that's what happen when you spitting what's inside you
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video
And they think they can market you however they decide to
Nah, but 40 told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
'Cause to have known me would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest, coulda fooled me
Boy, and to my city I'm the 2-3
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy
I'm just not the social type and campus life is crazy
Understand, I could get money with my eyes closed
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo
So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll
Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know
'Cause they need it much more than I ever will
I got new shit, I'm gettin' better still
Little niggas put my name in they verses
'Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal
Future said, "'Cause this 'Ye shit, you better kill"
And I think this got this Making-of-a-Legend feel
Problem with these other niggas, they ain't never real

[Outro]
Yeah, that's all I can say

[Intro: Kanye West, DJ Khaled & T-Pain]
Ayy, we go by The Runners
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from, ayy
DJ Khaled, We The Best (Go hard!)

I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from, ayy
Fuck nigga, you can't stop this!
Fuck the rest, we run this game, Kanye West, Khaled and Pain

[Hook: T-Pain]
Hey, if you could, you would get rid of me
What you gon' do when a nigga gotta go hard?
But I won't let you get to me (To me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard
If you was as real as me
You would never let another nigga step in yo' yard
Makin' money ain't shit to me
This is in my veins and it gets to my heart

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I go the hardest, flow so retard
I'm disgusted with myself, I mean, ugh, where do I start?
First I spin around and vomit, then I shit up on it
Fuck the beat up so bad, won't nobody get up on it
I flow sick, nigga how sick? Seasick
Got your hand out, don't look at me bitch
You lookin' at who made me rich
You lookin' at who made me rich
I had some wins, some losses
Just a life of a God damn boss's
With the top off, lookin' for a girl
With a ass as fat as Tracee Ross's
This is dope as it get, dope as a motherfuckin' acid trip
Fly as fifty-seven passengers, this finna be another classic, bitch
Everybody know I got it, if you want it then get at it
But I ain't gon' have it, no, I ain't gon' have it

[Hook: T-Pain]
Hey, if you could, you would get rid of me
What you gon' do when a nigga gotta go hard?
But I won't let you get to me (To me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard
If you was as real as me

You got another way to live, I gots to go hard (Go hard)
I am gettin' it in until the end
I gotta go (Go) go (Go) go (Go) go (Go hard)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I ain't ever been scurred
Never been the type to bite my words
When I came up, y'all gave me shit
Now I'm finna make y'all eat them turds
Always said what the fuck I felt
Go head, spit that murder I wrote
Man I don't care 'bout what you felt
Fuck you nigga, I know I'm dope
Felt like I'm comin' to get my all
Felt like I had to play the fly on the wall
Felt like niggas was stuntin' on me
Funny how I'm flyer than them all
Now I'm at the top, ain't nowhere to go now
Instead of me, she gon' go down
Maybe I would have slowed down
If I knew what I know now
I'm stupid, yeah I know I'm dumb
This could fuckin get old, well it's good I'm young
Before my heart get cold as the hood I'm from
Tell me what it take to be number one
I guess it's gon' be what it's gon' be
But here's one thing y'all got to hear
I'ma tell you like George Bush told me
Fuck y'all niggas, I'm out of here

[Hook: T-Pain]
Hey, if you could, you would get rid of me
What you gon' do when a nigga gotta go hard?
But I won't let you get to me (To me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard

I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from, ayy
I go hard for the hood, I go hard for the streets
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from, ayy
I go hard for the ghetto, Kanye West, T-Pain, DJ Khaled
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from, ayy
We The Best, we won't stop, we can't stop, We Global

[Hook: T-Pain]
Hey, if you could, you would get rid of me

[Intro]
Where's my snare?
I have no snare in my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo, yo

[Verse 1]
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick is the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans, explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the morning and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See, they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now! I bet you're prolly sick of me now
Ain't you, Mama? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Ha!)

[Verse 2]
I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
‘Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No, I don't, on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun
‘Cause I'da killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Uh)

[Verse 3]
Now, I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housing systems, victim of Münchausen's Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
But guess what, you're gettin' older now, and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick, he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral (Ha-ha!)
See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom!
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?!
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit!
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? (Hehe)
Well, guess what? I am dead—dead to you as can be!

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)
I said I'm sorry, Mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet

[Intro]
Before we go any further
Friends

[Verse]
As you call 'em, they call you when they need something
Trees for the bluntin', to G's for the frontin'
I found a way to get peace of mind for years and left the hell alone
Turn a deaf ear to the cellular phone
Send me a letter or better, we could see each other in real life
Just so you could feel me like a steel knife
At least so you could see the white of they eyes
Bright with surprise, once they finish spitting lies
Associates, is your boys, your girls, bitches, niggas, homies
Close, or really don't know me
Mom, dad, comrade, peeps, brothers, sisters, duns, dunnies
Some come around when they need some money
Others make us laugh like the Sunday funnies
Fam be around whether you paid or bummy
You could either ignore this advice or take it from me
Be too nice and people take you for a dummy
So nowadays, he ain't so friendly
Actually they wouldn’t even made a worthy enemy
Read the signs: "No feeding the baboons"
Seein' as how they got ya back bleeding from the stab wounds
Y'all know the dance, they smile in ya face, y'all know the glance
Try to put 'em on, they blow the chance
Never let your so-called mans know your plans
(How many of us have them?) A show of hands
(Friends) is a term some people use loosely
I'm real choosy on what I choose to let crew see
You telling me; I try to act broke
Jealousy the number one killer among black folk
Fellas be under some type of spell like crack smoke
Ghetto Cinderellas lead 'em right to your stack, loc
Just another way a chick'll lead to your end
I checked the dictionary for the meaning of friend
It said: "person one likes to socialize with
Sympathizer, helper", and that's about the size of it
Most of the time these attributes is one-sided
To bolster the crime, they're apt to shoot you through your eyelid
And they can't hide it, going wild like a white bitch
Sometimes ya need to cut niggas off like a light switch
(Flick!) And when things get quiet
Catch 'em like a thief in the night, what a riot
I first met Mr. Fantastik at a arms deal
Don't let it get drastic, think of how your moms'll feel
When it get for real, steel get to sparkin'
Everything darken, it ain't no talkin'
For somethin' so cheap, it sure buys a lot of trouble
Ya better off focusing than tryin' to plot to bubble
Or else it'd be a sad note to end on, the guns we got is
(One's we can depend on, friends)
Some come in the form of co-dependents
A lot of times only end up being co-defendants
Ten bucks say they tell for a lower sentence
And leave you up under the jail, begging for repentance
It don't make no sense, what happened to the loyalty?
Honor amongst crooks, trust among royalty
I'd rather go out in a blaze than give 'em the glory
(How many of us have—) a similar story?
(Friends) before lovers, we used to have some type of over-standing
Just so when I let her get the man thing
She know it's no strings, we could do the damn thing
But ho, it's no rings, just how the tramp swings
Will she see him again? That depends on
"How good was the skins?" and "Could she memorize the lessons?"
It ain't no need to pretend
Even though she let him stab it, she know they're just friends

[Outro]
Friends
How many of us have them?
Friends
Ones we can depend on?
Friends
How many of us have them?
Friends
Before we go any further

[Skit]
Fellas! Don't be silly! I know who my friends are!
And the next nice neighborhood I move into, you guys'll get crack'
(Negro humor always escaped me.)

[Outro Skit: Character 1; Mr. Fantastic; (Invisible Woman);
Dr. DOOM; Character 2]
The most powerful, the most mysterious monarch in all the world
Guided by a fighting force that never sleeps
That never relaxes its vigilance
For none is as feared, none has as many foes
As DOOM, the awesome armorclad lord of
I know who Doom is (Then tell us)
He happens to be the most dangerous man in the world
I’d hope we’d never hear from him
I’d hope we’d never have to battle him
But now the worst has happened and I must tell you what we’re up against
I first met DOOM years ago
When he wanted to be alone, alone to pursue his forbidden experiments
One day while conducting a secret experiment

[Explosion sounds] Later, when he recovered from his injuries
Instead of having learned his lesson, DOOM was bitter, angry, vengeful

[Woman screams] What have I done to myself?
My face, it is hideous
He traveled the world, seeking a cure for his disfigured face
(I’m sorry sir, there is nothing we can do for you)
He traveled through remote villages, where strangers are seldom seen
He continued his search, never showing his face
Unless threatened by bandits who prey on travelers
Who foolishly wander alone through their domain

[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah
Definitely, definitely
Definitely dope
Definitely
Definitely K-Mart
Yeah
Yeah (*Pbfft*)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
You find me offensive, I find you offensive
For finding me offensive, hence, if
I should draw the line or any fences, if so, to what extents, if
Any, should I go? 'Cause it's getting expensive
Being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive
They say I cause extensive psychological nerve damage to the brain
When I go to lengths this far at other people's expenses
I say you're all just too goddamn sensitive
It's censorship, and it's downright blasphemous
Let's end this shit now, 'cause I won't stand for this
And Chris-stiff-pher Reeves won't sit for this neither
And let's clear this up too, I ain't got no beef with him either
He used to be like a hero to me, I even believe I
Had one of those twenty-five-cent stickers on my refrigerator
Right next to Darth Vader
And Darth must've put a hex on him for later
I feel like it's my fault, 'cause of the way that
I stuck him up in between him and Lex Luthor
I killed Superman, I killed Super—
Man, and how ironic
That I'd be the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic

[Chorus: Eminem]
'Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain
Nice to meet you
Hi, my name is...
I forgot my name
My aim was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil
My new name is... Rain Man

[Verse 2: Eminem, Dr. Dre]
Now in the Bible, it says:
"Thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed
Have homosexual sex
Unless, of course, you were given the consent to join in
Then, of course, it's intercourse, and it's bisexual sex
Which isn't as bad
'Long as you show some remorse for your actions
Either before, during, or after
Performing the act of that which
Is normally referred to as such more commonly-known phrases
That are more used by today's kids in a more derogatory way
But who's to say what's fair to say and what not to say?"
Let's ask Dr. Dre—Dr. Dre? (What up?)
I got a question, if I may (Yeah)
Is it gay to play putt-putt golf with a friend? (Yeah)
And watch his butt-butt when he tees off? (Yeah)
But— 'ut, I ain't done yet
In football, the quarterback yells out, "Hut-hut"
While he reaches in another grown man's ass
Grabs on his nuts, but, just, what if
It was never meant—it was just an accident
But he tripped, fell, slipped, and his penis went in—
His teeny-tiny, little, round heinie, and he didn't mean it
But his little weenie flinched just a little bit
And I don't need to go into any more details, but
What if he pictured it as a female's butt?
Is that gay? I just need to clear things up
'Til then, I'll just walk around with a manly strut, because

[Chorus: Eminem]
'Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain
Nice to meet you
Hi, my name is...
I forgot my name
My aim was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil
My new name is Rain Man

[Verse 3: Eminem, Dr. Dre]
You find me offensive, I find you offensive—
Shit, this is the same verse, I just did this
When am I gonna come to my good senses?
Probably the day Bush comes to my defenses
My spider sense is telling me Spider-Man is nearby
And my plan is to get him next and
Open up a whoop-ass canister
God damn it, Dre, where's the goddamn beat? (Yeah)
Anyway, anyway, I don't know how else to put it
This is the only thing that I'm good-at
I am the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic
Demonic—yup, yup, don't worry, I'm on it
I got it, high-five Nick Lachey
Stuck a pin in Jessica's head and walked away (*Pfffffff*)
And as she flew around the room like a balloon, I
Grabbed the last can of chicken tuna out the trash can, and zoom, I
Headed straight back to the Neverland Ranch
With a peanut butter-jelly-chicken-tuna sandwich
And I ain't even gotta make no goddamn sense
I just did a whole song, and I didn't say shit

[Chorus: Eminem]
'Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain
Nice to meet you
Hi, my name is...
I forgot my name
My aim was not to become what I became
With this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil
My new name is Rain Man

[Outro: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
'Cause ah, uh, ah, eh, ugh...
Yup, Rain Man
Definitely, definitely Dr. Dre
Super-dope beatmaker
2000 and, 2000 and
Four-hundred-and-eighty-seven-million-nine-hundred-and-se-
-Seventy-three-thousand-four-hundred-and-sixty-three...
And seventy
Yeah

Exercise, flex on guys
Model chick
Sex on thighs
Bump a lot
A Lexus drive

Test her out, now she gon' need a stretcher when I stretch her out
When it's time to speak, bet all of ya'll listen

[Intro]
Kane is in the building

[Verse 1: Drake]
Who else is really trying to fuck with Hollywood Cole
I'm with Marley G's bro
Flying Holly Grove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in two's
And these days all the girls are down to roll
I hit the strip club, and all them bitches find a pole
Plus I been sipping, so this shit is moving kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my B's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
And I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Meet me on the fresh train
Yes I'm in the building, you just on the list of guest names
And all of my riders do not give a fuck, X-Games
Guns turn you boys into pussies, sex change
And I smoke 'til I got chest pains
And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jessie James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been flyin' so long I fell asleep on the fucking plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance, amen
As the world spin and dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playing in the sand
Uh, wake up and smell the pussy
You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me
I'm on a paper trail and ain't no telling where it took me
Yeah, and I ain't a killer but don't push me

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my B's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
How do you say what's never said?
Beautiful black woman, I bet that bitch look better red
Limping off tour, 'cause I made more off my second leg
Motherfuckin' Birdman Junior, 11th Grade
Ball on automatic start
I can hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw
Wildcat offense, check the paw prints
We in the building, you niggas in apartments
Uh, now come on be my blood donor
Flow so nice you ain't gotta put a rug on her
Do it big and let the small fall under that
Damn where you stumbled at? From where they make Gumbo at
Kane got the fucking beat jumping like a jumping jack
And you know me, I get on this bitch and have a heart attack
Hip-Hop, I'm the heart of that
Nigga, nothing short of that
President Carter, Young Money Democrat

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my b's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

[Verse 1]
Rebel for the hell of it, hella rich
Never have to sell a brick again—must I tell a bitch again?
The bullshit, I'm addressing; check, I'm on some next-level shit
Never been fucked in the game: I'm celibate
Rarely out my element, barely out the ghetto with
One foot out and one foot in, intelligent as fellas get
Listen, let's settle this; be clear—
I could fall back seven years; still, it ain't no one ahead of me
Consider it a blessing if you get to stand next to me
Five-star general, OG veteran
Caked like Entenmann's, blowing that celery
Stack that cash like the U.S. Treasury
Every single thing I ever did was done heavily
Rap until you're seventy, still ain't no catching me
Put it on my pops, Big Phil, and Beverly
Be standing on the top still after they bury me
Nose in the air: So stuck-up, arrogant
Ain't got long, hot songs: Best cherish it
'Cause when I drop mine, that's over: finito
You payin' for your foul like a free throw—bow!
Now, how could a nigga think that he could see me?
Other than the magazine covers or the TV?
Know I sold more mixtapes than your CD
You're waiting on your big break, praying you could be me
And you ain't made it far as D.C
On the low, I been all around the globe
Like a god, how they treat me
Broads hit they knees, eyes closed when they greet me
Mouth wide open, just begging me to skeet-skeet
You in a deep sleep—stop dreaming
I'm six albums in; for ten years, I been firing hot semen
The limelight's mine, I'm gleaming, beaming
Ask why I say I'm king? Bitch, I got my reasons (Hey!)

[Hook]
Wrist so frostbit (Yuh), neck so chilly (Bling)
All on my mind is to get more millys (Guap)
Niggas talk shit, that's silly (Ha)
"Shawty, he ain't about that, really" (Nah)
"Is he?" (Ayy) Nigga, I'm illy! (Yeah)
Haha! (Haha!) Haha! (Hey)
Ayy, I run this city, clearly (Bankhead)
Ayy, tell 'em, "Get lost, I'm busy" (Beat it!)
Really? (Yuh) Nigga, I'm illy (Ayy)

[Verse 2]
Where niggas get off? Piss off! (Yeah)
Me and mine ought to take time to pop a lid off
Shit, all over the whereabouts of me
Is y'all sick in your fuckin' mind? You figuring I'ma fizzle
Never cooled off: Tip scorching
Minimal injury, though they wishing me maximum misfortune
Number one, hands down; flows paint portraits
Everybody thinks you stink like horse shit
House full of chicks on some Girl Next Door shit
A king of oneself, thirty mil' out the store, quick
Of course, this case—lost all my endorsements
Tripled up on real estate, still buying more shit
But Tip bankrupt, according to your sources
I'm still caked up, along with more reinforcements
Tore shit up from the lobby to the rooftops
Officially the hottest nigga rapping since 2Pac
'Fore you rap 'bout me, best ask 'bout me
I'm out my fucking mind, need counseling
Please, don't doubt me; trust me, drama ain't nothing
It's all fun and games 'til somebody start busting
Limit my discussion when rappers be battling
I find out about it, better get to skee-daddling
Pack your family bags, move 'em out to Seattle, and
We ever cross paths, you'll need ambulance and bandages
Live life glamorous, so extravagant
Mandarin, Oriental, worldwide traveling
Hip-hop champion for real, though
You couldn't fuck with me with a Brazil ho, nigga
But still, though (Hey! Hahahaha)

[Hook]
Wrist so frostbit (Yuh), neck so chilly (Bling)
All on my mind (Hey) is to get more millys (Guap)
Niggas talk shit, that's silly (Ha)
"Shawty, he ain't about that, really" (Nah)
"Is he?" (Ayy) Nigga, I'm illy! (Yeah)
Haha! (Haha!) Haha! (Hey)
(Ayy, just remember, I do this shit when I want to, nigga. It's me, nigga!)
Ayy, I run this city, clearly (Bankhead! Zone 1, homie!)
Ayy, tell 'em, "Get lost, I'm busy" (Beat it!)
Really? (Yuh) Nigga, I'm illy (Ayy)
Wrist so frostbit (Yuh), neck so chilly (Bling)
All on my mind is to get more millys (Guap)
Niggas talk shit, that's silly (Ha)
"Shawty, he ain't about that, really" (Nah)
"Is he?" (Ayy) Nigga, I'm illy! (Yeah)
Haha! (Haha!) Haha! (Hey)
(I don't wanna hear shit 'bout "I can't rap like this when I ain't good as that one"—nigga, fuck you, partner!)
Ayy, I run this city, clearly (Bankhead!)
Ayy, tell 'em, "Get lost, I'm busy" (Beat it! Yeah)
Really? (Yuh) Nigga, I'm illy (Ayy)

[Outro]
Yeah (It's the King, bitch!)

[Intro - Nas]
Mic check, mic check

[Hook - Nas] (Beastie Boys)
One (one), two (two), three (three)
Too many rappers, and there's still not enough MCs
It goes three (three), two (two), one (one)
MCA, Adrock, Mike D, that's how we get it done
Like ladies and gents, attention
Nas in the house with Beastie Boys
We can turn it out
Perpetrators, we can point 'em out
So if you got somethin' on your mind, let it out

[MCA]
Yo, I been in the game since before you was born
I might still be MCing even after you're gone
Strange thought, I know, but my skills still grow
The 80s, the 90s, 2000s, and so
On and on until the crack of dawn
Until the year 3000 and beyond
Stay up all night, and I MC and never die
Cause death is the cousin of sleep

[Ad-Rock]
Because I'm back with a bang, boogie, oogie-oogie
Strawberry Letter 23 like Shuggie
Oh my God, just look at me
Grandpa been rappin' since '83
I'm supersonic like J.J. Fad
Got crazy-ass shit pullin' out the bag
Don't forget the tartar sauce, yo, cause it's sad
All these crab rappers, they're rappin' like crabs

[Nas]
I have carte blanche, the vagabond
Nas is the narcissist, my pockets are rotund
I'm no killa, but compared to you, I'm more real'a
You ain't a shot, a mobster, or a drug dealer
A slug peeler, you're not
Mafioso, no
You ain't got the cut-throat in ya, beginner
I ain't tryin' to hear your racket
You work with police, dog, you snitch, you rat
You wear that jacket

[Mike D]
How many rappers must get dissed
Gimme eight bars, and watch me bless this
I start to reminisce, ooh, when I miss
The real hip hop with which I persist
Like rum in mojitos
Bullets and banditos
Matzoh balls in soup
Jackets and troop
Yes, y'all, this is one for the history books
Nasty Nas, what's the word?
Count it off on the hook

[Hook]

[MCA]
Cause this the type of lyric goes inside your brain
To blow you bullshit rappers straight out the frame
My lyrics spin 'round like a hurricane twister
So get your hologram on off-a Wolf Blitzer
Too many rappers to shake a stick at
I oughta charge a tax for every weak rap I had to listen to
Cause we be makin' stacks like Stax Records
My squad, we gotta pact -- we're never coming wack

[Ad-Rock]
To all you crab rappers and hackers
And circuit benders tweaked on Splenda
I take the cake, I stole the mold
The golden microphone, well, that's mine to hold
And why all these biters all up in my crotchspace?
Sniffin', buffin', huffin'
And mean muggin' with a Blimpie Bluffin
Back up off me, suckas, you ain't sayin' nothin'

[Nas]
I'm broader than Broadway, I was the project hallway
Dual tape recorder, lacin' oratorials all day
I'm just getting started on this beat, this is foreplay
And when this song's finished, y'all can sing along with this
By the way, I have a strong fetish for Christian Louboutin steppers
I hear Russian blonde's the wettest
But anyway, I better pay homage to my fellas
And that's what's on my mind and the rhyme, who's next up?

[Mike D]
Mike D, the man of mystery
History in the makin', and now we're takin'
Titles, awards, and accolades
Scarin' the competition as I sharpen my blades
We come together like peanut butter and sandwiches
Like pen and paper, like Picasso and canvases
Rockin' stadiums and shitty bars
Go back in time, send a fax from my car

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
It's horrible
One lonely evening alone, home
End up with carpal tunnel syndrome
And here I am, known for giving heavy back aches
Grown and living off of Little Debbie snack cakes
Supposed to be checking emails
All I got is messages from ass naked females
I don't know a Jenny
She said it's free and I won't owe her a penny
And that's the last time I saw her
But thousands of more horrors on online Gomorrah
And Sodom, they got 'em with they curls out
And they got a better sales pitch than the Girl Scouts
I wonder what I owe her
For a whole box of caramel coconut samoa
("Nite nite!") Uh, okay honey, sweet dreams
Now it's time to get serious like Peek Freans
A metal handful, wipe it on the quilt
Wife wake up and I'm kill't over spilt milk
Locked in, looking at your picture
Fully clothed winter and I'm right there with ya
Thinking about the last time I split your wishbone
A man could only wish you do the same 'til he get home
Fat chance, at least he get snacks
That'd have to do 'til a brother get back
Until then smack One-Eyed Jack
And hope one of his peoples can hook him with a tri-pack
That's three different flavors
Chocolate, vanilla and strawberry wafers
Acting all hard, 'bout to get beat up
I'll show him what time it is once I get this sheet up
Soon as he fell off the beat down
All I hear is, "13th cell, put the sheet down"
Damn C.O., what the hell do she know?
Besides the fact she wanna get dug out on the d-low
A workaholic with a fountain in the ink pen
Out in the mountains and I stopped drinking again
In the wee hours, he's gotten farther
Needing three showers, being hot and bothered
The wiz with her legs bent, pregnant
God bless the day she wondered where her egg went
I need a L, it's hard to drink without it
And could use some kookies but trying not to think about it
Watching "BET" on jazz for knowledge on file
Every other commercial, college hoes gone wild
Soft batch, I prefer the other bunch
Like we got for lunch, chocolate fudge butter crunch

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
He don't mess with the Ritz Bits
Wheat Thins, Saltines or Triscuits
Matzos or Cheez-Its
Catch sugar fits every time that he sees
Chips Ahoy, double chocolate chunk
Something with the bubble and the junk in the trunk
Even the Oreos, no matter what weather
Always kept 'em dipped in milk and stuck together
In the game he's shameless
Even uses a code name: Famous Amos
It's cheaper than a short stay at the Days Inn
And good like 25 cent oatmeal raisin
Give a hand to who invented the camera
Skip past the graham, animal and Grandma’s
Shh, make sure she don't wake from her dream chill
Or get caught with a handful of cream fill

"Oh, honey! What are you doing? That's so nasty!"
It might seem ill
"Ew! Go wash your hands!" (No)
Kookies
"Get out of here!"

[Outro: Samples]
"DOOM is master of the world."
"I'd sure hate to see that ugly mug of yours in my history book."
"You've disturbed me for the last time."
(Voice 1): Hey, y'know something gang, that DOOM ain't really all bad
(Voice 2): What do you mean, Ben?
(Voice 1): Well, on account of him I had me a real good time. Y'know, I mean, between you and me I kinda like being black
(Voice 3): Well, maybe if we're lucky he'll attack us once more and send you back, Benjamin
(Voice 1): Ah-haha very funny, very very funny
(Voice 2): He must be mad
(Voice 4): Well, if anyone can do it. Nevertheless let's get out of here, while we can
(Misc. Voice): Food, we need food

[Intro]
StreetRunner

[Chorus: Betty Wright & Lil Wayne]
So you've got so many diamonds
You wear all the finest clothes
And your grill is shining
As you're driving down the streets of gold
But you can't blame me
If I set this stage on fire
Ha!

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Momma always told me I was crazy
And my hoes say I'm amazing, but I don't listen to a lady
But the bitch say I'm hot, and I say "No bitch, I'm blazing"
Like, what the fuck you expect? I'm a motherfucking Cajun
I feel caged in my mind, it's like my flow doing time
I goes crazy inside, but when it comes out—it's fine
Like wine; wait, watch...
See? I get better with time like a watch
Osh B'Gosh, Posh Spice husband
Couldn't kick it like I kick it, bitch! I Kix it
No cereal, like a landing, I sticks it
Wherever she asks me, after she licks it
"That's too explicit"; well, why you listening?
*Sniff* I smell smoke, and something's sizzling
That's her pussy
So, hey, pussy; play with pussy or play pussy

[Chorus: Betty Wright & Lil Wayne]
But you can't blame me
If I set this stage on fire
Hahahaha!

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
They say, "You're nobody 'til somebody kills you
Well, where I'm from, you're nobody 'til you kill somebody
And you know what they say; when you great
It's not "murder," it's "assassinate"
So assassinate me, bitch
'Cause I'm doing the same shit Martin Luther King did
Checking in the same hotel, in the same suite, bitch
Same balcony, like, "Assassinate me, bitch!"
It's Lil Tunechi
I don't rap, I film movies
With my rap, you could call me
"Mr. Director's Chair," yeah, and that's a wrap
Cut! On to the next...
Not the next scene, bitch, the next check
Some say the X makes the sex 'spec-
So play with the pussy or play pussy

[Chorus: Betty Wright & Lil Wayne]
So you've got so many diamonds
Hey, pussy, lay pussy
You wear all the finest clothes
Do what I... say, pussy, and I say, I say
And your grill is shining
Lay pussy, lay pussy, lay, pussy, haha
As you're driving down the streets of gold
Hey, pussy, haha!
But you can't blame me
Hey pussy, don't play pussy
If I set this stage on fire!
Get 'em!

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Straight off the corner of Apple and Eagle
Braveheart, bitch, like the times are medieval
Married to the game, divorced the cathedral
Standing on the corner selling porcelain to people
Forced into evil, it's all in your head
It's all so cerebral, call me Knievel
You follow and I lead you, straight to the needles
The bottles, the battles, the beetles'll eat you
Momma named Cita—I love you, Cita
'Member when your pussy second husband tried to beat ya?
'Member when I went into the kitchen, got the cleaver?
He ain't give a fuck, I ain't give a fuck neither
He could see the devil, see the devil in my features
He could smell the ether, you can see Cita
You can see the Cita, see the Cita in my features
And she don't play neither

[Chorus: Betty Wright]
But you can't blame me
If I set this stage on fire!

She gonna be with you she gonna see me she read' to go
Cause you have re-freshened me, I'm fresh head to toe
So let's go let's get let's get it hey
I know you need something different trying to get away
I use that as a segue
Let's hit a spot where they only speak Reggae
Like no one can do it this long
She said "Aye Kan', who you tryin' to be, Akon?"
Sorry the drink had me wildin' a little bit
But my link had me stylin' a little bit
I think I'm gonna hit the island in a bit
But what I said had you smiling didn't it
She laughed at this, but after this
You know I gotta take that off
Young Halle told me, "Make me feel good"
So I gave her the Monster Balls

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
I just want you close
Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better

[Bridge: Alicia Keys]
You and me together
Through the days and nights

Everything's gonna be alright
People keep talking
They can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright

[Hook: Alicia Keys]

[Verse 3: Alicia Keys]
When the rain is pouring down
And my heart is hurting
You will always be around
This I know for certain

[Bridge: Alicia Keys]

Through the days and nights
I don't worry cause
Everything's gonna be alright
People keep talking
They can say what they like

Try to divide
Something so real
So till the end of time

Can get in the way of what I'm feeling

[Chorus]
You know, you know
You know, you know

[Verse 1]
Uh, you know you know how the story goes
You done jocked my style, you done stole my flow
You done seen me out, you gets no hello
And you wonder why? Man you know you know
Yeah and you should let them boys know too
Show them niggas every single thing I showed you
I'm here feeling like 50 back in ’02, and everybody sayin' I'm the man, so true
Yeah but what does it take to feel secure?
A place with wooden floors and space to put awards
A couple of parking spots and maids to do the chores
The cars you always wanted, the women that you adore
Well I got it, I got it
I wonder if I'd be happy without it, I doubt it
I try not to really think about it
I made it but I'm still playin' like I'm bein' scouted 'til I'm out it
Game time bitch, I hope you're proud of us
King James shit watch me throw the powder up
This OG got my whole suite cloudin' up
And I bet you I be out of time before I'm out of luck

[Pre-Chorus]
They ain't rootin' for me, they ain't clappin' for me
I'm only sayin can somebody just be happy for me
I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue but you know you know

[Chorus]
You know, you know
You know, you know

[Verse 2]
Uhh, please make your long story shorter
Cause time is of the essence for the king of first quarter
Numbers do the talkin' I have nothing for reporters
I just hope we make these flights and don’t get held up at the border
Yeah, so you can spare me all the accolades
I'm the reason you can find my city on an atlas page
Half a million dollars later and my taxes paid
And I'm still spendin' money from my actin' days
Damn, life is such a lovely thing
Feel the perks that a 7 figure budget bring
Tell your girlfriend that I can pull some fuckin' strings
So we're courtside when LeBron get a fuckin' ring
Yeah, I bet I be there I be there
You see that ’62 sittin outside? That's me there
I'm jumpin to the top its my leap year, prepare
Putting in that overtime I never said it'd be fair
I'm always left wishin' I could have done it in person
My apologies to all of the ones I was hurtin'
I got new girls but none of they love is for certain
And call old girls but none of they numbers are workin'
Damn, what happened to us?
Life can always change, you have to adjust
How come when I got a party you stare at me in disgust?
They pay us just to have fun you should see that as a plus
Especially when I come flyin' through the door
And kindly ignore, the paparazzi outside tryin' to record
Why has every woman never dined here before?
Am I the only 23 year old wine connoisseur?
The Rothschilds, the Cru's, the Gajas and the Opuses
It's always nice when you're out with someone that notices
My condo got that art gallery openness
I'm just really hopin' that that isn’t what your motive is

[Pre-Chorus]
They ain't rootin' for me, they ain't clappin' for me
I'm only sayin' can somebody just be happy for me?
I really hate to say I told you so
So I bite my tongue but you know you know

[Chorus]
You know, you know
You know, you know

[Produced by Evidence & Kanye West]

[Intro: JAY-Z]
Aight, let's run it, let's run it
Yo fuck you, Kanye, first and foremost
For making me do this shit. Muh'fucker
Had to throw everybody out the motherfucking room
'Cause they don't fucking--

[Kanye West]
I'd like to propose a toast
I said toast, motherfucker!

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I am
(Here's to the Roc)
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them
(Here's to Roc-A-Fella)
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky and
(Here's to the Roc)
This is the last call for alcohol, for the
(Mr. Rockefeller)
So get your ass up off the wall

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
The all around the world Digital Underground Pac
The Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer of the Roc
I take my chain, my fifteen seconds of fame
And come back next year with the whole fucking game
Ain't nobody expect Kanye to end up on top
They expected that College Dropout to drop and then flop
Then maybe he stop savin' all the good beats for himself
Roc-A-Fella's only niggas that helped
My money was thinner than Sean Paul's goatee hair
Now Jean Paul Gaultier cologne fill the air, here
They say he bougie, he big-headed
Would you please stop talking about how my dick head is
Flow infectious, give me ten seconds
I'll have a buzz bigger than insects in Texas
It's funny how wasn't nobody interested
'Til the night I almost killed myself in Lexus

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Now I am
(Here's to the Roc)
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them
(Here's to Roc-A-Fella)
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky and
(Here's to the Roc)
This is the last call for alcohol, for the
(Mr. Rockefeller)
So get your ass up off the wall

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Now was Kanye the most overlooked? Yes sir
Now is Kanye the most overbooked? Yes sir
Though the fans want the feeling of A Tribe Called Quest
But all they got left is this guy called West
That'll take Freeway, throw him on tracks with Mos Def
Call him Kwa-li or Kwe-li, I put him on songs with JAY-Z
I'm the Gap like Banana Republic and Old Navy, and oooh
It come out sweeter than old Sadie
Nice as Bun-B when I met him at the Source awards
Girl he had with him - ass coulda won the horse awards
And I was almost famous, now everybody love Kanye
I'm almost Raymond
Some say he arrogant, can y'all blame him?
It was straight embarrassing how y'all played him
Last year shoppin' my demo, I was tryin' to shine
Every motherfucker told me that I couldn't rhyme
Now I could let these dream killers kill my self-esteem
Or use my arrogance as the steam to power my dreams
I use it as my gas, so they say that I'm gassed
But without it I'd be last, so I ought to laugh
So I don't listen to the suits behind the desk no more
You niggas wear suits 'cause you can't dress no more
You can't say shit to Kanye West no more
I rocked 20,000 people, I was just on tour, nigga
I'm Kon, the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my mom a purse, now she Louis Vuitton Mom
I ain't play the hand I was dealt, I changed my cards
I prayed to the skies and I changed my stars
I went to the malls and I balled too hard
"Oh my god, is that a black card?"
I turned around and replied, "Why yes
But I prefer the term African American Express"
Brains, power, and muscle, like Dame, Puffy, and Russell
Your boy back on his hustle, you know what I've been up to
Killin y'all niggas on that lyrical shit
Mayonnaise-colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips

[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I am
(Here's to the Roc)
And they ask me, they ask me, they ask me, I tell them
(Here's to Roc-A-Fella)
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky and
(Here's to the Roc)
This is the last call for alcohol, for my niggas
(Mr. Rockefeller)
So get your ass up off the wall

[Outro]
So this A&R over at Roc-A-Fella, named Hip Hop Picked the "Truth" beat for Beanie. And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like "Who that spittin'?" I'm like "It's me." He's like "Oh, well okay."
Uhh, he started talkin' to me on the phone, going back and forth
Just askin' me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, 'cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin' with

So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?

And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, "Look, man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap"

No ID: "Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap"

[Saxophone Solo]

I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer

[Hiphop: "I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper"]

I'm like oh shit. I was messin' with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that "Truth" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin' off like that. I was stayin' in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin' like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then
I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, "Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin', called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin' right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time. And really I just, like bit the drums off "Xxplosive" and put it like with a sped-up sample, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on "This Can't Be Life."

And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop 'cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin' 'cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JAY-Z and he said, "Oh you a real soulful dude."

[JAY-Z: "Oh you a real soulful dude, man"]

And he, uh, played the song 'cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio. You know how he do it, one take. And he said

[JAY-Z: "Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here"]

"Tell me what you think of this." And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type JAY-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, "What you think of it?"

[JAY-Z: "So what you think of this?"]

And I was like, "Man that shit tight," you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that, I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin' really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord 'cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to...

[Donda West: "Come on, let's just go"]

...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up...

[Donda West: "Kanye, baby, we're here"]

...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, "Heart of the City." And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did "Nothing Like It" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hip-hop said, "Yo play that one beat for him." And I played "Heart of the City." And really I made "Heart of the City," I really wanted to give that beat to DMX

[Hiphop: "No I think Jay gon' like this one right here"]

And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, "Yo what's up I'm Kanye."

[Dame: "Yo, you that kid, Kanye?"]

"You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats"

[Dame: "Jay got classics, G."]

You know I ain't talkin' shit. I'm like "oh shit." And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin', these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, "yo Jay I could rap." And I spit this rap that said, uh "I'm killin' y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips." And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said, "Man that was tight."

[JAY-Z: "That, that was cool. That was hot."]

That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, "H to the Izzo," my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course, later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. "Gimme a beat that sound like JAY-Z." You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, "yo but I rap too." Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy 'cause you know, 'cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them "Jesus Walks" and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say, "Naw." Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man...

[Jessica: "Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real."]

I'm not gonna say nothin' to mess my promotion up

["Y'all niggas is stupid"]

Let's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad

[Joe: "We gonna change the game, buddy."]

Dame was like, "Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack."

[Dame: "You gotta make sure it's not wack."]

Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, 'cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'

"I go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow
I got 11 plaques on my walls right now
You got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow."

Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like "oh shit"

[Dame: "Oh shit it's not even wack."]

"I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot."

[Dame: "it's actually kinda hot."]

Like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'Like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like "yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick"

[Dame: "you don't wanna catch a brick"]

"You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on." I told Hip-hop and Hip-hop was all, "oh, word?" Actually, even with that, I was still about to take the deal with Capitol 'cause it was already on the table and 'cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, 'cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, "oh he's just a producer-rapper," and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, "yo... Capitol pulled on the deal"

[Mel: "Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal."]

And, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, "man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?"

So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?
So won't you raise your glass, won't you?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I got a big ego (Ha ha ha), I’m such a big ego (Uh-uh-uh)
I got a big, (eh-eh-eh), ego, she love my big, (eh-eh-eh), ego
So stroke my big, (eh-eh-eh), ego
I like to joke around a little bit, but here we go
Welcome to the wonderful world of gold-plated Earl, 'cause
Every thing I throw up, blow up
Talking to the girl She said, "Know what, grow up, you nasty,"
"I don’t understand why they trippin’, if you ask me"
Flow is just the nicest, I emit the propane
I just spit, probably just raised the gas prices
Everybody in the club try and get as fresh as me
What you want, dawg? Tryna stay recession free
And spit, refreshingly when I rock the stadium
You probably get sweaty you should bring a extra tee
Now I’m standing next to Jay who standing next to B
You coulda been anywhere in the world, but you’re here with me
That’s good for my ego, me and my ego
And it go wherever we go my ego is my imaginary friend
He was with me when I was only imagining
I had dreams of the league, one day I play Kobe
I walk up to Puff and he already know me
Coulda let the dream killers kill my self esteem
Or use the arrogance as a steam that power my dreams
And my ego

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
It's on baby, let's get lost
You don't need to call into work 'cause you're the boss
For real, want you to show me how you feel
I consider myself lucky, that's a big deal
Why? Well, you got the key to my heart
But you ain't gonna need it, I'd rather you open up my body
And show me secrets, you didn't know was inside
No need for me to lie

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
He talk like this cause he can back it up
He got a big ego, such a huge ego
I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this cause he can back it up

[Verse 3: Beyoncé]
Usually I'm humble, right now I don't choose
You can leave with me or you could have the blues
Some call it arrogant, I call it confident
You decide when you find on what I'm working with
Damn I know I'm killing you with them legs
Better yet them thighs
Matter a fact it's my smile or maybe my eyes
Boy you a sight to see, kind of something like me

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
I talk like this cause I can back it up
I got a big ego, such a huge ego
But he loves my big ego, it's too much
I walk like this cause I can back it up

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
I, I walk like this cause I can back it up
I, I talk like this cause I can back it up
I, I can back it up, I can back it up
I walk like this cause I can back it up

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
It's too big, it's too wide
It's too strong, it won't fit
It's too much, it's too tough
He talk like this cause he can back it up
He got a big ego, such a huge ego
I love his big ego, it's too much
He walk like this cause he can back it up

[Outro: Beyoncé]
Ego so big, you must admit
I got every reason to feel like I'm that bitch
Ego so strong, if you ain't know
I don't need no beat, I can sing it with piano...
Whoa...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, woo
(Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh)

[Chorus]
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back

[Verse 1]
I murder a rhyme, one word at a time
You never heard of a mind as perverted as mine
You better get rid of that 9, it ain't gonna help
What good's it gonna do against a man that strangles himself?
I'm waitin' for Hell, like hell, shit, I'm anxious as hell
Manson, you're safe in that cell, be thankful it's jail
I used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve
Thirteen, I was puttin' shells in a gauge on a shelf
I used to get punked and bullied on my block
'Til I cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mailbox
(Hey Ma', Ma'!)
I used to give a fuck, now I could give a fuck less
What do I think of success? It sucks, too much press
I'm stressed, too much cess, depressed, too upset
It's just too much mess, I guess I must just blew up quick (Yes)
Grew up quick (No), was raised right
Whatever you say is wrong, whatever I say's right
You think of my name now whenever you say, "Hi"
Became a commodity 'cause I'm W-H-I-
T-E, ‘cause MTV was so friendly
To me, can't wait 'til Kim sees me
Now, is it worth it? Look at my life, how is it perfect?
Read my lips, bitch! What, my mouth isn't workin'?
You hear this finger? Oh, it's upside down
Here, let me turn this motherfucker up right now

[Chorus]
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (Shady!)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back

[Verse 2]
I take each individual degenerate's head and reach into it
Just to see if he's influenced by me, if he listens to music
And if he feeds into this shit, he's an innocent victim
And becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe
(*Scratches*) My name is Slim Shady
I been crazy way before radio didn't play me
The sensational (*scratch*) "Back is the incredible!"
With Ken Kaniff, who just finds the men edible
It's Ken Kaniff on the Internet
Tryin' to lure your kids with him into bed
It's a sick world we live in these days
"Slim, for Pete's sakes, put down Christopher Reeve's legs!"
Geez, you guys are so sensitive
"Slim, it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it"
Mind with no sense in it, fried schizophrenic
Whose eyes get so squinted, I'm blind from smoke in 'em
With my windows tinted
With nine limos rented, doin' lines of coke in 'em
With a bunch of guys hoppin' out, all high and indo-scented
And that's where I get my name from, that's why they call me—

[Chorus]
They call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back (Back)

[Verse 3]
I take seven {kids} from {Columbine}, stand 'em all in line
Add an AK-47, a revolver, a 9
A MAC-11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine
And that's a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time
‘Cause I'm Shady, they call me as crazy
As the world was over this whole Y2K thing
And by the way, NSYNC, why do they sing?
Am I the only one who realizes they stink?
Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think
Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?
It's why I tend to block out when I hear things
‘Cause all these fans screamin' is makin' my ears ring (Ahh!)
So I just throw up a middle finger and let it linger
Longer than the rumor that I was stickin' it to Christina
‘Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
It'd be Jennifer Lopez and Puffy, you know this
I'm sorry, Puff, but I don't give a fuck
If this chick was my own mother, I'd still fuck her with no rubber
And cum inside her and have a son and a new brother
At the same time and just say that it ain't mine—what's my name?

[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back
They call me Slim Shady (I'm back)
I'm back (I'm back), I'm back

[Outro]
Guess who's b-back, back
Gue-gue-guess who's back (hi, Mom!)
{​​*scratch*}​​ Guess who's back
{​​*scratch*}​​ Gue— {​​*scratch*}​​ guess who's back
D-12 {​​*scratch*}​​ guess who's back
Gue, gue-gue-gue, guess who's back
Dr. Dre {​​*scratch*}​​ guess who's back
Back back {​​*scratch*}​​ back {​​*scratch*}​​
Slim Shady, 2001
I'm blew out from this blunt (*sighs*) fuck

[Intro]
It's alright, it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Gonna make it, can't give up now
I'ma make it somehow

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I just feel like quittin', I still might
Why do I put up this fight? Why do I still write?
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin' with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
Somethin' ain't right, hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright, drawin' a blank like
Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault
Great big eyeballs, my insides crawl
And I clam up, I just slam shut
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's
Just been stripped, I have just been 'vict'd
So I must then get off the bus then split
Man, fuck this shit, yo, I'm goin' the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road

[Chorus]
I'm a man, I'ma make a new plan
(It's alright, it's okay)
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Once I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back
(I'ma make it somehow)
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin'
(It's alright, it's okay)
Sorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road
(I'ma make it somehow)

[Verse 2]
I'm walkin' these train tracks, tryna regain back
The spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant, in the same pants
Tryna chase rap, gotta move ASAP
And get a new plan, Momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad
Ain't no tellin' what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin' from somethin' I never wanted so bad
Sometimes I get upset, ‘cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much, man, I'm just tryna do what's best
And I try, sit alone and I cry
Yo, I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky, please, I'm beggin' you, God
Please don't let me be pigeonholed in no regular job
Yo, I hope you can hear me, homie, wherever you are
Yo, I'm tellin' you, dawg, I'm bailin' this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me, baby, I'm never too far
But yo, I gotta get out there, the only way I know
And I'ma be back for you the second that I blow
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go back to this 8 Mile Road

[Chorus]
I'm a man, gotta make a new plan
(It's alright, it's okay)
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Once I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back
(I'ma make it somehow)
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin'
(It's alright, it's okay)
Sorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road
(I'ma make it somehow)

[Verse 3]
You gotta live it to feel it; you didn't, you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is
To be walkin' this borderline of Detroit city limits
It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate
Of authenticity, you'd never even see
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility
You never seen, heard, smelled or met a real MC
Who's incredible or on the same pedestal as me
But yet I'm still unsigned, havin' a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MCs in the lunchline
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go?
Who must I show to bust my flow?
Where must I go? Who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket?
‘Cause I ain't havin' no luck with this little rabbit's foot, fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin' to doubt shit
I'm feelin' a little skeptical who I hang out with
I look like a bum, yo, my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army, tryna salvage an outfit
And it's cold, tryna travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm always stuck in this battlin' mode
My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one, this city is no fun
There is no sun, and it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein' pulled apart
From each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends
It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not
What I'm doin', I just blow, my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn
Yo, it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin', no, next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred
Time to show these Free World leaders the three and a third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road

[Chorus]
I'm a man, gotta make a new plan
(It's alright, it's okay)
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Once I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back
(I'ma make it somehow)
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin'
(It's alright, it's okay)
Sorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone
(I'm gonna make it anyway)
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own
(Gonna make it, can't give up now)
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road
(I'ma make it somehow)

[Intro]
This motherfucker, man! Just won't shut up, will you?
Talking 'bout I owe him
Bitch, you owe me! I'm promotin' you right now
Yo, let's put the nail in this coffin!

[Hook]
I don't wanna be like this
I don't really wanna hurt no feelings
But I'm only being real when I say
Nobody wants to hear their grandfather rap (Nope)
And old men have heart attacks
And I don't wanna be responsible for that
So, put the mic down and walk away
You can still have a little bit of dignity

[Verse]
I would never claim to be no Ray Benzino
An eighty-three-year-old fake Pacino
So how can he hold me over some balcony without
Blowin' his lower back out as soon as he goes to lift me? (Ugh!)
Please don't—you'll probably fall with me
And our asses'll both be history (Aah!)
But then again, you'd finally get your wish
‘Cause you'd be all over the street, like 50 Cent (Hahahaha)
You fuckin' punk! Pussy, fuck you, chump!
Give me a one-on-one, see if I don't fuck you up
Tryna jump the Ruff Ryders and they cut you up
And you put Jada on a track, that's how much you suck
Dick in the industry, swear that you in the streets hustlin'
You sit behind a fuckin' desk at The Source butt-kissin'
And beggin' motherfuckers for guest appearances
And you can't even get the clearances
'Cause real lyricists don't even respect you or take you serious
It's not that we don't like you—we hate you, period
Talk about a mid-life crisis, damn
Last week you was shakin' Obie Trice's hand
Now he's a buster? What the fuck's with that?
Get on a track dissin' us, kissin' 50's ass
And askin' me what I know about indictments, bite me!
Bitch, I got two cases and probation—fight me!
What do I know about standin' in front of a judge like a man
Ready to take whatever sentence he hands?
What you know about your wife slicin' her wrists, right in
Front of the only thing that you have in this world- a little girl?
And I put that on her, when this is all over
I would never try to make her a star and eat off her
I don't know shit about no choppin' rocks
But what you know about Hip Hop Shops rockin' spots
Where you're the only white boy up in that bitch, just rippin'?
Pressin' up your own fliers and your stickers, stickin'
Them bitches up after spendin' six hours at Kinko's
Makin' copies of your covers of cassette singles
To sell them out of the trunk of your Tracer
Spendin' your whole paychecks at Disc Makers
What you know about being bullied over half your life?
Oh, that's right, you should know what that's like, you're half white (Haha)
Vanilla Ice, spill the beans and rice
I'm eatin' you alive inside, Jesus Christ!
If you're that much of a gangsta, put the mic down!
You should be out killin' motherfuckers right now
Kill a motherfucker dead, kill him dead, bitch!
Shoot 'em in the fuckin' head—go ahead, bitch!
Slap my mom! Slap the fuck out of her!
She can't sue you, she wouldn't get a buck out of ya
‘Cause you're broke as fuck, you suck, you're a fuckin' joke
If you was really sellin' coke, well, then what the fuck
You stop for, dummy? If you slew some crack
You'd make a lot more money than you do from rap (Haha)
You'll never have no security, you'll never be famous
You'll never know what it's like to be rich, life's a bitch, ain't it?
Raymond? Here, let me break this shit down in layman's terms for you
Just to make sure that you can understand us
And Canibus ain't using too many complicated fuckin' words for you
Here, and let me slow it down for you
So that you can understand if I say it slower
Let it go, dog, it's over

[Hook]
I don't wanna be like this
I don't really wanna hurt no feelings
But I'm only being real when I say
Nobody wants to hear they grandfather rap (Nope)
And old men have heart attacks
And I don't wanna be responsible for that
So, put the mic down and walk away
You can still have a little bit of dignity

[Outro]
Haha… talkin' 'bout... I have motherfuckers... callin' your crib
Bitch, you ain't even got a fuckin' crib!
You ain't even got a fuckin' phone… fuckin' bum!
Threatenin' to... shut me down at your lil' fuckin' Source magazine if I come back on you and attack you
Bitch, you attacked me first!
Take it like a man, and shut the fuck up!
And fuck your little magazine too
I don't need your little fuckin' magazine
I got XXL's number anyways
And y'all can't stand it, ‘cause they gettin' bigger than y'all
Oh... and by the way... how'd I look on the VMA's?
When you was watchin' me from...
Whatever fuckin' TV you was watchin' me from
In Boston… the mean streets of Boston
Fuckin' sissy! And you got us scared up in here, motherfucker
Suck our motherfuckin' dicks!
Oh!... And for those that don't know
Don't get it twisted, y'all... The Source has a white owner!

[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad
Buy all of the things I never had
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Oh, every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shiny lights, yeah
A different city every night, oh, I, I swear
The world better prepare for when I'm a billionaire

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah, I would be the host of
Everyday Christmas, give Travie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit
Give away a few Mercedes, like, here, lady, have this
And last but not least, grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single so
You can call me Travie Claus minus the ho-ho
Aha, get it?
I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid
Everywhere I go, I'ma have my own theme music

[Chorus: Bruno Mars & Travie McCoy]
Oh, every time I close my eyes (What you see, what you see, bruh?)
I see my name in shiny lights (Uh-ha, uh-ha, yeah, what else?)
Oh, yeah, yeah, a different city every night, oh, I, I swear
The world better prepare (For what?) for when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh, when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Let's go)

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
I be playing basketball with the president
Dunking on his delegates
Then I compliment him on his political etiquette
Toss a couple milli' in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the fives, twennies, tens, and bens completely separate
And yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
And not a single tummy around me
Would know what hungry was
Eating good, sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket, pull out your wallet
And put it in the air and sing

[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars & Travie McCoy]
I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad (So bad)
Buy all of the things I never had (Buy everything, ha-ha)
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen (What up, Oprah? Ha-ha)

[Chorus: Bruno Mars & Travie McCoy]
Oh, every time I close my eyes (What you see, what you see, bruh?)
I see my name in shiny lights (Uh-ha, uh-ha, yeah, what else?)
Oh, yeah, yeah, a different city every night, oh, I, I swear
The world better prepare (For what?) for when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Sing it) when I'm a billionaire
Oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)

[Outro: Bruno Mars]
I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad

[Intro]
Food & Liquor

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
Yeah, my man said he wanted something real
Real, real, real, real
Something he could recognize, something he could feel
Feel, feel, feel, feel
Baby girl said she was in the mood for something real
Real, real, real, real (FNF)
Something that could make her move, something she could feel
Feel, feel, feel

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Lust, sometimes can override trust
She said that's why she gave it up
My man said blood spilled out of everything he touched
He crushed everything, he crushed
Ruined everything he loved, he just wanted the rush
Blamed it on the times being rough
Doing dirt with the devil, chasing after the dust
Make a fuss if it's them, but we hush if it's us

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
That's why, my momma said she wanted something real
Real, real, real, real
Something she could be proud of, something she could feel
Feel, feel, feel, feel
She said they so used to not having nothin' real
Real, real, real, real
That they don't know how to act, they don't know how to feel
Feel, feel, feel

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Life, ain't meant to come around twice
Yeah, that's why I gotta get it right
They said I got it honest, now I gotta give it light
But sleep on it, that's why God give you night
I mean, I had a dream that God gave me flight
Too fly for my own good, so God gave me plight
If I wake up in the morning now I gotta give 'em sight
Make 'em see, break 'em free, ain't a G, show you right

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco & Sarah Green]
The game is not to give 'em nothing real
Real, real, real, real
Nothing that they could use, nothing that they could feel
Feel, feel, feel, feel
Give 'em a bunch of lies and teach 'em that it's real
Real, real, real, real
So that's all they'll know, that's all that they'll feel
Feel, feel, feel

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Struggle, another sign that God love you
'Cause on the low, being poor make you humble
Keep they names in my rhymes to try and keep 'em out of trouble
'Cause being poor also teach you how to hustle
All they want is some shoes or some rims for they bubble
Now that I got my own I can hit 'em with a couple
Cuff my homies so they ain't got no reason to cuff you
That's my plan, if I can on the man up above you

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco & Sarah Green]
That's why, I gotta give 'em something real
Real, real, real, real
Something they could recognize, something they could feel
Feel, feel, feel, feel
To my homies on the block I gotta give 'em something real
Real, real, real, real
Something that'll make 'em stop, something they can feel
Feel, feel, feel

[Outro: Lupe Fiasco & Sarah Green]
Yo! FNF are real; really real, yea
You know what it is, woo
Baby girl said she was in the mood for something real
Real, real, real, real
Let's go
So real, so real, so real

[Intro: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Marshall! Sounds like an SOS
Holy wack unlyrical lyrics, Andre, you're fucking right!
To the Rapmobile—let's go!
(Marshall! Marshall!)
Bitches and gentlemen! It's showtime!
Hurry hurry, step right up!
Introducing the star of our show
His name is (Marshall!)
You wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the world right now
So without further ado, I bring to you (Marshall!)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
You 'bout to witness hip-hop in its most purest
Most rawest form, flow almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest known artist
Chip off the old block, but old Doc is (back)
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
Vrinn, vrinn! Yeah, here I come, I'm inches
Away from you, dear, fear none
Hip-hop is in a state of 9-1-1, so

[Chorus: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Quick, gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Gee willikers, Dre, holy bat syllables!
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham
When I'm gone, time to get rid of these rap criminals
So skip to your lou while I do what I do best
You ain't even impressed no more, you're used to it
Flow's too wet, nobody close to it
Nobody says it but still everybody knows the shit
The most hated on out of all those who say they get hated on
In eighty songs and exaggerate it all so much
They make it all up, there's no such thing
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
People, when you're rappin' and you know what for
The show must go on; so I'd like to welcome y'all
To Marshall and Andre's carnival, c'mon!

[Chorus: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Now let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)

[Verse 3: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
It's just like old times, the Dynamic Duo
Two old friends, why panic? You already know
Who's fully capable, the two caped heroes
Dial straight down the center, eight-zero-zero
You can even call collect, the most feared duet
Since me and Elton played career Russian Roulette
And never even see me blink or get to bustin' a sweat
People steppin' over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely
Ease over these beats and be so breezy
Jesus, how can shit be so easy?
How can one Chandra be so Levy?
Turn on these beats, MCs don't see me
Believe me, BET and MTV
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dog, fo' sheezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear
Into the mountains, nothin' but clowns down here
But we ain't fuckin' around 'round here
Yo, Dre (What up?) Can I get a "hell..."? (Hell yeah!)

[Chorus: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Now let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns; can I get a witness? (Hell yeah!)

[Outro: Eminem]
So there you have it, folks
(Marshall!) has come to save the day
Back with his friend Andre
And to remind you that bullshit does not pay
Because (Marshall!) and Andre are here to stay
And never go away
Until our dying day
Until we're old and grey (Marshall!)
So until next time, friends
Same blonde hair, same rap channel
Good night, everyone!
Thank you for coming! Your host for the evening (Marshall!)
Oh! Heh

[Verse 1]
I'm steady tryna find the motive (Motive)
Why I do what I do?
Freedom ain't getting no closer (Closer)
No matter how far I go
My car is stolen (Stolen)
No registration (-Tration)
Cops patrollin' (Patrollin')
Now they done stop me and I get locked up

[Chorus]
They won't let me out
They won't let me out
I'm locked up
They won't let me out (No!)
They won't let me out
I'm locked up
They won't let me out
They won't let me out
I'm locked up
They won't let me out (No!)
They won't let me out

[Verse 2]
Heading uptown to re-up (Re-up)
Back with a couple keys (Keys)
Corner block's on fire (Fire)
Undercovers dressed as fiends (Fiends)
Making so much money (Money)
Product's moving fast (Fast!)
Put away the stash
As I sold the last bag
Fucked around and got locked up

[Chorus]
They won't let me out
They won't let me out (My nigga, I'm locked up)
They won't let me out (No!)
They won't let me out
I got locked up
They won't let me out
They won't let me out (Baby girl, I'm locked up)
They won't let me out (No!)
They won't let me out

[Verse 3]
‘Cause visitation no longer comes by (Comes by)
Seems like they forgot about me ('Bout me)
Commissary is getting empty (Empty)
My cell mates getting food without me (Without me)
Can't wait to get out
And move forward with my life (Ooh no, with my life)
Got a family that loves me
And wants me to do right
But instead, I'm here locked up

[Chorus]
They won't let me out
They won't let me out (Ohh! I'm locked up)
They won't let me out (No!)
They won't let me out (My nigga, I'm locked up)
They won't let me out
Oh, oh, oh! (They won't let me out)
I'm locked up
They won't let me out (No!)
They won't let me out

[Outro]
Can you pay me a visit? (They won't let me out)
Send me some magazines? (They won't let me out)
Send me some money orders? (They won't let me out) (No!)
Pay me a visit, baby (They won't let me out)
‘Cause I'm locked up (They won't let me out)
Where's my lawyer? (They won't let me out)
I'm locked up (They won't let me out) (No!)
Get me out of here (They won't let me out)
I'm locked up, they won't let me out
They won't let me out (Baby, I'm locked up)
They won't let me out (No!)
Where's my niggas on the lock-down? (They won't let me out)
Damn, I'm locked up, they won't let me out
I'm locked up, they won't let me out
Ohhh! They won't let me out
Can you please accept my phone calls? (They won't let me out)
I'm locked up, locked up, locked up

[Intro]
Oh my goodness, what have I done?
Oh no, I can't believe it
It's like I've got the whole world in my palm
And I'm ready to drop bombs

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the Slim Shady Mecca, Rebecca
It's the village in New York, right next to the Tribeca
That's my sector, homosexual dissector
Come again, rewind selector
I said, nice rectum, I had a vasectomy Hector
So you can't get pregnant if I bisexually wreck ya
Hannibal Lecter in the guy section, I bet ya
I tantalize ya and in less than five seconds I get ya
They say once bitten then twice shy, well lie next to the guy
With nine ecstasy pills and five extra
Boxes of ribbed condoms in quantities, why yes sir
I took the rest of the Lunesta pills from my dresser
That's my kind of vibe, what else should I try, Lester?
Drop-kick the bitch before her second trimester
Perform the home abortion with Dexter, then I guess I'll
Dig her fetus out with a wire hanger, then digest her

[Chorus]
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in
I said, I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends

[Verse 2]
All my Westside bitches throw it up
Put a balloon inside your pussy, queef, and blow it up
Man, I think that he just fell off the deep end, sure enough
So you better change the station to keep from throwing up
Man, you seen it all before, you're all too familiar with it
There's a penis on the floor and two balls, so you know who did it
You know you with it, girl, don't front, oh no you didn't
I won't rape all the Pussycat Dolls? Nicole, you kiddin'?
I'll pee on Rihanna, see man, I do what I wanna
Spray perfume in the sauna room, crazy-gluin' Madonna
To the La-Z-Boy sofa, fold her in two, then sit on her
Imagine the visual for that, man, who would've thought I
Could ever be such a relentless prick, unleashing his vengeance
But the chick's so old, she looks like she outlived a life sentence
I never meant this rhyme to be so offensive
If you weren't so defensive, it wouldn't be, you're so sensitive

[Chorus]
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in
I said, I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends

[Verse 3]
Put Christopher Reeves on a unicycle with a kickstand
Kick it up and push him and lead him right into quicksand
Here, you need a hand, big man? Grab hold of this branch
With both hands, man, they don't understand, I'm just a sick man
Now everybody's pissed at me
Like it's my fault his name rhymes with so many different words, jeez
So one last time, Mr. Christopher Reeves
Won't you break it down for me and just spit the verse, please?
"Eminem, I'm coming to kill you (inhale)
Always hated you, and I still do
You'll never fill my shoes, my Superman costume (inhale)
Doesn't even fit you, they don't feel you
You're taking this shit too far (inhale)
Who do you think you are? Hang my suit up in the armoire
Every day I hate you more and more, throw down the cardboard
Let's breakdance if you think you're hardcore"

[Chorus]
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in
I said, I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends

[Outro]
The world is mine

Tougher than a lion, ain't gon' needa try it
I live where the sky ends, yup! You know this (Young!)
Never lying, truth-teller
That Rihanna reign just won't let up
All-black on, blacked-out shades (Shades)
Blacked-out Maybach
I'ma rock this shit like fashion
As in, going 'til they say stop (Hold up)
And my runway never looked so clear
But the hottest bitch in heels right here (Here)
No fear, and while you're getting your cry on
I'm getting my fly on
Sincere, I see you aiming at my pedestal
I better let you know

[Chorus: Rihanna & Jeezy]
That I, I, I, I'm so hard (So hard)

[Verse 2: Rihanna & Jeezy]
All up on it, know you wanna clone it
Ain't like me, that chick too phony (Young!)
Ride this beat, beat, beat like a pony
Meet me at the top, top, top getting lonely (Young!)
Who think they test me now?
Run through your town, I shut it down
Brilliant, resilient
Fan mail from twenty-seven million (Young!)
And I want it all
It's gonna take more than that, hope that ain't all you got
I need it all (Hold up!)
The money, the fame, the cars, the clothes
I can't just let you run up on me like that
All on me like that, yeah
I see you aiming at my pedestal
So I think I gotta let you know

[Chorus: Rihanna & Jeezy]
That I, I, I, I'm so hard (So hard)

So hard (Yeah!) so hard (Yeah!)
So hard (Yeah!) so hard (Yeah!)

[Verse 3: Jeezy]
It's go hard or go home, back to your residence
Soon the Red Dogs give the block back to the presidents
I used to run my whole block like Obama them
You ain't gotta believe me, go ask my momma them
Couldn't even come in my room, smelled like a kilo
Look like me and two of my boys playing casino
Count the style I keep in my bag, they can't afford it
Tell 'em "Give me back my swag," they tryna clone it
See my Louis chucks, Louis flag, Louis frames
Louis belt, what that make me, Louis Mane?
I'm in the all-white party wearing all black
With my new black watch, call it the heart attack
Cardiac arrest, Carti'ac a wrist
Yeah, they say they hard, they ain't hard as this
Hard: the one word describes me
If I wasn't doing this, you know where I'd be to 'em

[Bridge: Rihanna & Jeezy]
Where them girls talking trash? Where them girls talking trash?
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
Where them bloggers at? Where them bloggers at?
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
Where your lighters at? Where your lighters at?
Where they at? Where they at? Where they at?
So hard (Yeah!) so hard (Yeah!)
So hard (Yeah!) so hard (Yeah!)

[Chorus: Rihanna & Jeezy]
That I, I, I, I'm so hard (Yeah!)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard (Yeah!)
That I, I, I, I'm so hard (So hard)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard (Too hard)
So hard, so hard (So hard)
So hard, so hard (Too hard)

[Outro: Rihanna]
That I, I, I

[Intro: Voletta Wallace]
Baby, look at me
Mama love you
And I know you ain't no little boy no more
But you'll always be my baby
It seems like only yesterday I was holding you in my arms
Now look at you now, Biggie
But I worry about you
I worry about you all the time
Hangin' out on the corner
All times at night with the cruel people
Baby, that ain't nothin' but trouble
I always taught you that you could have whatever you dream
Well, I want you to hold onto that dream, baby
Hold on to it real tight, ‘cause the sky's the limit

[Break: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
How's everybody doin' tonight? (Alright)
I'd like to welcome to the stage (Alright, alright)
The lyrically acclaimed, ha (Woo)
I like this young man, because when he came out (Hahahaha)
He came out with the phrase:
He went from ashy to classy — haha, I like that (Alright, alright)
So everybody in the house give a warm
(Uh) Round of applause for The Notorious
B.I.G, ha
The Notorious B.I.G, ladies and gentlemen
Give it up for him, y'all!

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Uh
A nigga never been as broke as me, I like that
When I was young, I had two pair of Lees, besides that
The pinstripes and the gray
The one I wore on Mondays and Wednesdays
While niggas flirt, I'm sewin' tigers on my shirts, and alligators
You wanna see the inside? Huh, I see ya later
Here comes the drama
"Oh, that's that nigga with the fake"
Blaow! "Why you punch me in my face?" Stay in your place
Play your position (Uh), here come my intuition (Uh-huh)
Go in this nigga pocket, rob him while his friends watchin'
And hoes clockin', here comes respect
His crew's your crew, or they might be next
Look at they man eye, big man, they never try
So we rolled with 'em, stole with 'em
I mean loyalty, niggas bought me milks at lunch
The milks was chocolate, the cookies — butter crunch
'88 Oshkosh and blue and white dunks, pass the blunt

[Chorus: 112]
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Have what you want, be what you want

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I was ashamed, my crew was lame
I had enough heart for most of 'em
Long as I got stuff from most of 'em
It's on, even when I was wrong, I got my point across
They depicted me the boss, of course
My orange box-cutter make the world go round
Plus I'm fuckin', bitches ain't my homegirls now
Start stackin', dabbled in crack, gun packin'
Nickname Medina, make the seniors tote my ninas
From gym class to Inglés, pass off a global
The only nigga with a mobile, can't you see like Total
Gettin' larger in waists and tastes
Ain't no tellin' where this felon is headin', just in case
Keep a shell at the tip of your melon, clear the space
Your brain was a terrible thing to waste
'88 on gates, snatch initial name plates
Smokin' spliffs with niggas, real-life beginner killers
Prayin' God forgive us for being sinners, help us out

[Chorus: 112]
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Have what you want, be what you want

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
After realizin', to master enterprisin'
I ain't have to be in school by ten, I then
Begin to encounter with my counterparts
On how to burn the block apart
Break it down into sections, drugs by the selections
Some use pipes, others use injections
Syringe sold separately, Frank the Deputy
Quick to grab my Smith & Wesson like my dick was missin'
To protect my position, my corner, my lair
While we out here, say the Hustler's Prayer:
"If the game shakes me or breaks me
I hope it makes me a better man, take a better stand"
Put money in my mom's hand
Get my daughter this college plan so she don't need no man
Stay far from timid, only make moves when your heart's in it
And live the phrase "Sky's the limit"
Motherfucker, see you chumps on top

[Chorus: 112]
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Have what you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin' on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
What you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on

[Intro]
I call this one Yoga… Flame
(Yoga flame!) Aww!

[Verse]
Meditate, on the floor, fold your legs, resonate
Breathing speed, regulate, clear my mind till it levitate
Dhalsim, I beat the game, level 8, hella good
Never great cause God is great, so ain’t no goats, ain’t no gates
Fences see the rams ram, lambs let, sheep’s skate
Brace yourself, teeth straight, fix your face for Pete’s sake
Birthday wordplay, piece of cake, fold the flow with seats for eight
Ororo Munroe, make it rain, not with bills, I make it change
Take that cool shit, make it lame, take that nerd shit, make it bang
Yeah, you heard us make it bang, yeah, ya heard me make it bang
Melt the change and make a ring, take that ring & make a bracelet
Take that bracelet make a chain, look how far my necklace hang
Connect that chain up to a crane, pull the game up by the brains
Could not move it just with brains so I had to use some bling
Shouts to Drizzy, shout to Wayne, Yeezy, Jeezy, Ricky, Fifty
Raekwon, Loso, Gucci Mane, I’m not going to drop my name
Sneak that message to the masses, you can call me Chocolate Rain
You might think my wallet drained, look how far my pockets hang
That’s cause I got pocket change, my net worth is basketball
They net worth is soccer games tell them niggas stop it mane
But they cannot stop it mane, so, they forced to watch it drain
They be looking so blue like water when I wash my jeans
King without the whoppers and, King without the cobbler
And King and I ain’t got no dreams, Bruce Lee, dishwasher
Cleaning out your pots and pans, these niggas ain’t got no stain
Power once I hit them with the powder
Then throw em’ in the shower
These niggas slower than some dial-up
I be on my broadband, these niggas still downloadin’
Lu finished, you still up on YouSendIt, uShare
ZShare, how long you going to be there? Damn…
FinallyFast.com for you fam
Information super highway, these niggas ain’t got no lane
But you can ride my shoulder like they pulled you over
I sit in the driver’s seat, you sit on the sofa
I am Patrick Swayze, you are Whoopi Goldberg
Cause he was a beast in the way that he controlled her
Rest in peace to Patrick, rest in peace to Stacks, kid
Rest in peace to rap, no, rest in peace to wackness
Yeah, nigga, I whacked it
Baby boy with the glasses
He is like a black rap Zach Galifianakis
Hangover, game over, nigga that’s it!
(Yoga flame!)

[Intro: DJ Khaled]
DJ Khaled! We the best
Who? We, nigga! We the best
This the remix! The "I'm So Hood" remix!
I'm makin' mo—vies!
I'm so hood, remix!

[Chorus: T-Pain, DJ Khaled & Young Jeezy]
(I'm so hood!) Yeah, I wear my pants below my waist
And I never dance when I'm in this place
We always gon' be the best, man
'Cause you and your man is plannin' to hate (We run this, man)
(I'm so hood!) And I got these golds up in my mouth
I make hit records, man, this is what I do
If you get closer to my house, then you know what I'm talkin' 'bout
I'm out the (Hood!) And if you feel me, put your hands up
I'm out the, this the remix
(Hood!) My hood niggas, can you stand up?
Put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up
I gave you We Takin' Over (Yo Khaled)
(I'm so hood!) If you not from here you can walk it out
Ay, Young Jeezy (I got 'em, homie)
And you not hood if you don't know what I'm talkin' 'bout
You got me? (Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm (We run this, man, we run this!)

[Verse 1: Jeezy, Ludacris & T-Pain]
I'm so H to the double O-D
Walk around, there's goddamn money on me
Pockets so fat, don't make no sense
Whips so clean, it don't need no tints
Watch so bright, it don't need no light
You know where it were, don't need no mic
Niggas like, "Young, what you get for your show?"
Tell 'em, "Same thing I used to get for the blow"
Set 'em on the run, nigga, what I got to lose?
Put 'em in the vans, I ain't talkin' 'bout the shoes
Do the speed limit, watch out for the lights
Pussy ass niggas, gotta watch out for the dykes
Seventeen-five, yeah nigga, I said it
Seventeen-five, yeah nigga, I meant it
And when we do it bad, but I'm doin' good (In my hood, Luda!)
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so motherfuckin' (Hood!)

[Verse 2: Ludacris & T-Pain]
Look here, everybody come equipped with bangers
Throwin' up our middle fingers
And you know I don't slip
So I gotta keep ten in the clip and one in the chamber
Better be walkin' with angels
And never take candy from strangers
Through the stress and strife
Had to earn my stripes like I played with the Bengals (Hood!)
I'm in the zone, holmes, goin' for the two-point conversion
I'm so hood that Ludacris shoulda been on the original version
But this is the remix, with the cheap tricks, hittin' sweet licks
And I cut the braids off
But the waves and the fade'll make you seasick
See this is the way that we ball
And this is the way that we brawl
So put a fist in the air if you care
That united we stand and divided we fall
When the South's in the house, better watch your mouth
'Cause we on that hood shit
I'm hood rich, comin' around your hood, bitch
I swear I'm so—

[Chorus: T-Pain, DJ Khaled & Busta Rhymes]
I'm so hood! (Remix!) and if you feel me, put your hands up
(Hood!) My hood niggas, can you stand up?
Khaled, they actin' like we ain't
(I'm so hood!) If you not from here you can walk it out
The kings of the streets and the gods of the hood
And you not hood if you don't know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Busta Bust, bitches!
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm so hood!

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes & T-Pain]
See all I know is how to go and get my money again and again
Top down, let the money blow in the wind
With a bad bitch sittin' in the passenger seat
With a doobie-wrapped head full of bobbie pins
You know I keep that thang when I walk
See the dialect different from the slang in my talk
Baby still leavin', got a crackhead frontin'
Got another bad bitch that'll boost for the spark (Hood!)
I'm used to leavin' the strip last
Hustlin' until the sun comes up gettin' cash
So much bread in all of my four pockets
It look like a nigga got hips with an ass
And from the DNA in my blood
Niggas idolize me and try to do what I does
And if that other nigga ain't really from the hood
You can easily die, tell who that fake nigga was (Hood!)
And even though I spit a little rap
Got niggas in the hood tryna sell the most crack
Violator, I send a nigga to do it
Just to make you spend a lot of money just to get your shit back!
Y'all niggas know where I'm from
And I rep it to the fullest 'til the day that I'm done
So hood where we live, if a nigga sold drugs
And he rich, momma still proud of her son! (Hood!)

[Verse 4: Big Boi & T-Pain]
Daddy Fat Saxxx so hood like the Cadillac
Ornament, on from the Babylon
Call an ambulance to come and pick that ass up
Cause the nigga never had the chance
They tryna dance with the devil in a pale moonlight
Advance on a level that they can't do right
Lay hands on a fella like the man in blue lights
Whoop, whoop, do it twice (Hood!)
Your boy the B-I-G
I'm nicer than MC in your top three
You cocky, I cock, squeeze
Bust them things, now you sloppy
Speed it up, slow it down then screw it
Don't bite the flow cause I got that fluid
Run through the crew on some whole other new shit
Newness, bitch, we do this

[Chorus: T-Pain, DJ Khaled & Lil Wayne]
I'm so hood! (Remix) and if you feel me, put your hands up
(Hood!) My hood niggas, can you stand up?
(I'm so hood!) If you not from here, you can walk it out (Alright)
And you not hood if you don't know what I'm talkin' 'bout (Weezy!)
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm so hood!

[Verse 5: Lil Wayne, T-Pain & Fat Joe]
I'm so Hollygrove, New Orleans (Lil Weezyana)
Home sweet, Home Depot, you will need a hammer
It go down like Frasier, I ain't talkin' Kelsey Grammer
I be shittin' on you boys, I need a Alka-Seltzer sandwich, ugh (Hood!)
Since I heard Plies, I done bought the Phantom back
And went and got me a fifty-two inch Maybach (Calca, ghetto gatka, haha)
I'm eatin' like a big dog, I'm so full, I'm so good
I'm so straight, you so fake, I'm so real, I'm so hood (I'm so hood!)
Yup, crack, crack, crack, crack-crack-crack-crack-crack-crack

[Verse 6: Fat Joe, T-Pain & Birdman]
Yeah nigga, welcome to the Crackhouse
I should own a McDonald's the way I bring the MAC's out
I'm from the hood where every nigga lies
Flip a couple grams, they tell you they bakin' pies, shit (Hood!)
Still got my name carved in that central bookin'
Gave that pussy a scar and told her, "Good lookin'" (Yeah)
You's a crack baby, that means your momma paid me
You can't even blame me, that's what the hood made me

[Verse 7: Birdman & T-Pain]
Martin Luther King, Calliope, Magnolia, Melpomene
Gettin' that money with a triple beam
We ride on Clyde, on Josephine
Saints is my team, that's what we breathe nigga
That's how we eat, get this money on the streets nigga (Hood!)
VL my street, blood, five star G, blood
Fly as a bird, got these eagles on my seat, blood
Then head back where I stay, 3rd Ward, we get that cake
Thirteen is where I lay, shouts out to M-I-A (Hood!)

[Verse 8: Rick Ross & T-Pain]
Mo' money, mo' problems, don't call me conceited
Just call me the boss, always got what you needed
M-I-Yayo so hot, but my neck got the fever
If you sneeze, you get shot, Gunplay makin' believers (Hood!)
I just bought me a ranch, watch the hundreds stacks
No, those ain't Rolex diamonds, what you done to that?
You fools fugazi, my fools from Haiti
I moves 'em daily – it's a movie, baby! (Hood!)

[Intro]
Naw, I'm just saying like, I'm just trynna see you, you know what I'm saying? What you was doing after this
Naw, I stay not too far from here, like right down the street-yea like right there

[Verse 1]
Baby you summertime fine
I'll let you get on top, I'll be the underline, I'm
Tryna get beside you like the number 9, dime
You fine as hell
I guess I met you for a reason only time could tell, but well
I'm wondering what type of shit you on
Do you like the finer things or are you a simple woman?
Would you drink with a nigga, do you smoke weed?
Done be ashamed, it ain't no thang, I used to blow trees
Getting lifted
I quit the shit, I might get high with you
It's only fitting cause I'm looking super fly with you
A flower you, a powerful, you do something to me
Cause girl I caught the vibes
Like you threw something to me-so I threw em back
Now all my niggas hollering "who is that?
Oh boy she bad nigga, what you bout to do with that?"
I'm finna take you home sip a little Patron now we zoning
Baby you so fine

[Hook]
Ay can I hit it in the morning?
Can I hit it in the morning?
The sun rising while you moaning

[Verse 2]
Yea, yea now are you shy or is you freaky lady?
Are you shallow cause if not I'll take it deeper baby
Tell me what turns you on
You like the slow songs?
You like some candles lite?
That ain't really my style
But see I planned a trip
And yea we both coming
Just tell me how you want it
I give it to you like I owe you something
When I'm on it, on it like my job
I'm hoping I confess
This life gets hard I can take away your stress if you let me
You knew just what this was when you met me
So let your guard down girl
I'll take your bra down girl and undress ya
Real slow yea I'll make you feel special
I can feel your heart beating fast
From the passion, ya hands reaching for the sheets to grab
And now ya leaking, freaking ain't no speaking but you moaning!
Ya so fine I got to give it to you

[Hook]
Ay can I hit it in the morning?
Can I hit it in the morning?
The sun rising while you moaning

[Verse 3]
I got a slight obsession-of watch your face while ya moaning
Do you like caressing or do you like aggression?
You the fighting, wrestling, biting pillows
Do you want it in the dark or while the lights is still on?
I'm fantasizing in my mind bout how your body feel
While we sweating you dripping wet from what your body spill
Now if your nervous and hesitant just let it go
See baby lately seems my life been hell and heaven knows
That you looking like an angel-sent from the heavens, God bless your every angle
Got a nigga tangle in your spider web
I'm doing shit I never might of did
And I ain't stopping baby even if the light is red
Your body's right as rain
So where the hydroplane
That ass is fat baby ain't no way to hide your frame
Thank God I found you
Just holla when you want it
Cause girl your so thorough

[Produced by Metal Fingers]

Regular storage procedure, the same as the other food
What other food?
Fish (Food) protein (Fast for ya)

[Skit 4]
Now what happened?
Well, the cop got
The next morning I went to the store to get some food
(Bread and butter) They arrested me
I'll save you (Thank you)
Would you like a snack?
Thanks for the drink

[Skit 5]
Operation Doomsday complete
All your intercoms casualty and damage testing

[Skit 6]
Enough! You talk of the people's rights
The people have only those rights which I choose to give them
And that's for their own good, believe me
I do, DOOM
They disappoint me, they must work faster
But the prisoner-
Ah yes, the young traitor who has tried to turn my people against me
Watch him. I have special plans for that one

[Verse 1]
Beef rap, could lead to getting teeth capped
Or even a wreath for mom dukes on some grief crap
I suggest you change your diet
It can lead to high blood pressure if you fry it
Or even a stroke, heart attack, heart disease
It ain't no starting back once arteries start to squeeze
Take the easy way out phony, until then
They know they wouldn't be talking that bologna in the bullpen
So disgusting, pardon self as I discuss this
They talk a wealth of shit and they ain't never seen injustice
Bust this, like a cold milk from out the toilet
Two batteries, some Brillo and some foil, heat'll boil it
He be better off on PC glued
And it's a feud so don't be in no TV mood
Every week it's mystery meat, seaweed stewed
(Food, we need food!)

[Verse 2]
He wears a mask just to cover the raw flesh
A rather ugly brother with flows that's gorgeous
Drop dead joints hit the whips like bird shit
They need it like a hole in they head or a third tit
Her bra smell, his card say, "Aw Hell!"
Barred from all bars and kicked out the Carvel
Keep a cooker where the jar fell
And keep a cheap hooker that's off the hook like Ma Bell
Top bleeding, maybe fella took the loaded rod gears
Stop feeding babies colored sugar-coated lard squares
The odd pair swears and God fears
Even when it's rotten, we've gotten through the hard years
I wrote this note around New Year's
Off a couple of shots and a few beers, but who cares?
Enough about me, it's about the beats
Not about the streets and who food he 'bout to eat
A rhyming cannibal who's dressed to kill and cynical
Whether is it animal, vegetable or mineral
It's a miracle how he get so lyrical
And proceed to move the crowd like a old negro spiritual
For a mil', do a commercial for Mello Yello
Tell them devils, "Hell no, sell y'all own Jello"
We hollow krills, she swallow pills
He follow flea collar three dollar bills
And squealed for halal veal, if y'all appeal
Dig the real, it's how the big ballers deal
Twirl a L after every meal ("Food!")

[Verse 3]
What up? To all rappers: shut up with your shutting up
And keep a shirt on, at least a button-up
Yuck, is they rhymers or strippin' males?
Out-of-work jerks since they shut down Chippendales
They chippin' nails, DOOM tippin' scales
Let alone the pre-orders that's counted off shippin' sales
This one goes out to all my peoples skippin' bail
Dippin' jail, whippin' tail and sippin' ale
Light the doobie 'til it glow like a ruby
After which, they couldn't find the Villain, like Scooby
He's in the lab on some old Buddha Monk shit
Overproof drunk shit, but who'd'a thunk it?
Punk, try and ask why ours be better
Could be the iron mask or the Cosby sweater
Yes, you, who's screwed by the dude on the CD, nude
("We need food!")

[Intro]
Ow, baby

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
I don't believe it, it's almost too good to be true
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing

[Verse 1]
The way she moves, she's like a belly dancer
She's shaking that ass to the new Nelly jams, I
Think someone's at the door, but I don't think I'ma answer
Police saying "freeze," (Oh), d-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, freeze?
Please, I'm a human being, I have needs
I'm not done, not 'til I'm finished peeing
I am not resisting arrest, I am agreeing
Mr. Officer, I'm already on my knees
I can't get on the ground any further, it's impossible for me
And do not treat me like a murderer, I just like to pee
Pee, pee, yes, I make R&B
I sing song, it go ring-a-chong, a-ching-chong-chong-chong-ching
Psych, I joke, I joke, I kid, I kid
If I offend, I'm sorry, please, please, forgive
For I am Triumph the Puppet Dog, I am a mere puppet
I can get away with anything I say and you will love it

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
Jessica Simpson looks oh so tempting
Nick, I ain't never seen an ass like that
Every time I see the show on MTV, my pee-pee goes
D-doing, doing, doing

[Verse 2]
Mary-Kate and Ashley used to be so wholesome
Now they getting older, they're starting to grow bum-bums
I go to the movies and sit down with my popcorn
Police saying "freeze," (Oh), d-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, freeze? Geez, I just got my seat
I have ticket, look, I put it away, my zipper's zipped
Please do not remove me from this movie theater, please
I did not even get to see Mary-Kate shower scene
I didn't mean to be obscene or make a great, big scene
And don't treat me like I'm Pee-wee Herman, this movie's PG
Mr. Officer, I demand to see my attorney
I will simply plead innocent, cop a plea, and be free
Free, yes, free, right back on the streets
What do you mean my lawyer's with Michael, he's too busy?
I am Triumph, Britney Spears has shoulders like a man
And I can say that and you'll laugh 'cause there's a puppet on my hand (Hahaha)

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
Hilary Duff is not quite old enough, so
I ain't never seen a butt like that
Maybe next year, I'll say "ass" and she'll make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing

[Verse 3]
The way she moves, she dances like a go-go
In that video, she sings, "Get out, you bozo"
I need a new boyfriend, hi, my name is JoJo
Police saying "freeze," (Oh), d-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, freeze? My computers will be seized
And my keys to my ranch, I just bake cookies
Mr. Officer, lookie, take a whiff of this
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this
Nobody is safe from me, no, not even me
I don't even know if I can say the word "pee-pee"
Pee, on the radio, but I think I did
Janet, is that a breast? I think I just saw a tit
Psych, I joke, I joke, I kid, I kid
I don't think my joke is working, I must flee quick
Get to the chopper, everybody get out
I am not Triumph, I am Arnold, get down

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
So Gwen Stefani, will you pee-pee on me, please?
I ain't never seen an ass like that
'Cause the way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing

[Outro: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Woo
Fuck is wrong with you?
Hah

[Intro]
Yessir!
It's me
The rapper eater, haha!
Feed me! Feed me! Feed me!
No homo
Ahaha
Yeah!

[Verse]
One time for me, one time for the DJ
He be Khaled, I be Lil Weezy—
Baby, if you ask me, if you're nasty
Creative, gifted bastard, spit sporadic
I'm so diplomatic, democratic
Touch it, bring it, push it—systematic
Damn right, I kissed my daddy
I think they pissed at how rich my daddy is
And I'm his kid—I stunt with my daddy
Call Miss Lee, she with my daddy
So diss me and don't diss my daddy
'Cause who was there when no one wasn't? Just my daddy
Who was there when I needed money? Just my daddy
So who be there when I see the money? Just my daddy
Who said that I'd be the one? Just my daddy
Hello, hip-hop; I'm home—it's your daddy
When I say "deez," I don't mean the Caddy
I mean "deez nuts," Akons and Khaled
Rick Ross, Tip, Stunna and Fat Joe
And I ca-ca-can't forget Brisco
And yeah, I done squashed the bullshit with Zoe
It's a bakery here, just tryin' to get dough
Shout to my dreads, my Haitians and chicos
You looking for me, ho? I'm in the 3-0—
5, I'm the best rapper alive
Homeboy got a mind that a map wouldn't find
Homeboy got a nine that a cop wouldn't find
But I could get to it even if I was blind
Like a scary movie, they screaming when I rhyme
I'm a king—you can ask Stephen if I'm lying
I'm a Prince, too demanding like my mom
Too bold, too cold like wet salam—
Mi, me, it's all about me
If the girl got a voice, then she talk about me, me!
He say, she say, I say me
We'll be in the M-I-A-mi
With me, and T, and Big Ronnie
And the homie Streets prob'ly somewhere on the beach
And Tez and E prob'ly somewhere in the Jeep
And Marl' in the Phantom with Mr. G
And me! Me! It's all about me!
Play with me and it's all-out beef
Beef! Yes! Chest! Feet!
Tag! Bag! Blood! Sheets!
Yikes! Yeeks! Great Scott—
Storch, can I borrow your yacht?
Watch me and my clique go all-out
Like the ball in the stands, we balls out, ugh!
Boy, I don't know what y'all 'bout
But I just spit like a dog mouth
Pink ice, just looking like a hog mouth
Vroom! I had to bring the hog out
Light them trees, bring a log out
Every day Christmas, I'm eggnogged out
And hip-hop is my new-bought house
My flow just grew legs and walked out—bye

[Verse 1]
I wanna hold 'em like they do in Texas, please (Woo)
Fold 'em, let 'em hit me, raise it, baby, stay with me (I love it)
LoveGame intuition, play the cards with spades to start

[Bridge]
I won't tell you that I love you
Kiss or hug you
'Cause I'm bluffin' with my muffin
I'm not lyin', I'm just stunnin' with my love-glue-gunnin'
Just like a chick in the casino
Take your bank before I pay you out
I promise this, promise this
Check this hand 'cause I'm marvelous

[Chorus]
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
(She's got me like nobody)

[Post-Chorus]
P-p-p-poker face, f-f-fuck her face

[Verse 1]
I’m performing tonight you know that shit gone be packed
Pay me in advance and make sure that it’s exact
My ex girl’ll probably show up for the simple fact
That tomorrow she can tell all of her friends it was whack
But fuck that though, this about me
They say my whole fan base is missing ID
But the young trendsetting musician I be
Got critics giving up the recognition I de-serve
Never bring your Mrs by me
I’m it I’m it call me Mr. IT
If I get one wish I'ma wish to die free
They say gon head, ball like Ms. Arie and I do
The realest in my age group, no shit
SoHo, Cosmo, Balmain blow fish
Let's make a toast, tell your friends come closer
Drinks on me like a coaster

[Chorus]
We doing it big
Look at what I done
Look at where I’m is
It’s only just begun
'Cause I was staying home
When they was having fun
So please don’t be surprised when they announce that I won
And this is how my speech goes
I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit
That’s all I got to say, at the top is where I stay
And tell my haters never go away
The Winner

[Verse 2]
Long awaited, hated
Fans see me out and they holla happy belated
It’s about time that you made it
I was bumping your songs when nobody else played it
When I was up in Hot Beats in Atlanta steady giving daps
Fetching niggas drinks but I never got to rap
If anybody asked though I prolly woulda snapped
But I can’t sign nothing 'til my lawyer get the facts and
No one decides who the definition of talent is
And Mrs. Murray look at what my talent did
And what your business is
It's been a couple years
Guess it’s not about who you know
It’s just how you balance it
It’s always awkward to dummy a nigga artist
And get on someone song when you know you coming the hardest
It's how you start actin' when nobody can reach you
My plan just hatched, happy easter

[Chorus]
We doing it big
Look at what I done
Look at where I’m is
It’s only just begun
'Cause I was staying home
When they was having fun
So please don’t be surprised when they announce that I won
And this is how my speech goes
I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit
That’s all I got to say, at the top is where I stay
And tell my haters never go away
The Winner

[Verse 3]
Uhh, ok I do it for the love
Bunk bed flow, always one level above
If I’m in your starting five you will never need a sub
And I’m neva looking down so I always know wassup
A lot of people sayin' fuck me
Problem is they be telling everybody but me
But I always got a Starbucks verse
Being brewed too hot please please double cup me
They never gave me support like Chuck Ts
And I never trust a nigga saying trust me
Nick cannon and will never did it this ill
So you tell the house band don’t you dare interrupt me
Thanks to my mother for never giving up
You deserve the world, now gon' live it up
Thanks to Uncle Steve, my hero who always saved us
I could never give back everything you gave us

[Bridge]
And to my dad even though we was apart
I couldn’t leave you out, you forever in my heart
Yeah, and in the name of Evelyn Sher
I’ll forever forgive anybody that never was there
For me, no other woman could ever compare
My angel, I hope heaven’s prepared for whenever you there

[Verse 4]
I got a revolutionary flow in every scenario coming through your stereo
Got a new chick, booty round like the merry go
Bitches like where he at, they be like there he go
And this verse deserve a burial
Don’t cry for me this ain’t motherfucking Mario
Yeah and Polo isn’t at my session
Mr.Anticipation keeping everybody guessing like

[Chorus]
We doing it big
Look at what I done
Look at where I’m is
It’s only just begun
'Cause I was staying home
When they was having fun
So please don’t be surprised when they announce that I won
And this is how my speech goes
I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit, I deserve this shit
That’s all I got to say, at the top is where I stay
And tell my haters never go away
The Winner

[Intro]
Michael Phelps, this for you, baby!

[Verse 1]
I'm goin' for the gold, my heart is in control
My mind is on succeed and I am in the lead
Don't buy into the schemes, the science or strategy
Just giant N-U-Ts brings triumph and belief
I'm a lion or a dean, inspired by the green
Never tired or fatigued, never defiant to my team
Never lying on the thing until I'm lying on the thing
Hooked to wires and things; I'ma die as a king
If I don't do it now, I'ma try it again
And when I do accomplish it, I'ma try it again
I'm a riot, insane; I'm a lion, my mane
Hangs down to my strings and they're tied to the game
I stay dry when it rain, I'm tired of the fame
Got everything to gain and I'm proud of the pain
The pride and the plain, the wise and the strange
Denied by the sane; besides, we're the same
Who's guiding the train? Who's flyin' the plane?
Who's driving the lane? Who dies when it bang?
Who fires when it bang? Who lies in the aim?
Two lives in the drain; who cries when they sang?
You hide but you can't; you high but you ain't
I advise you to think; you'll find what you can't
Revive what you taint, survive what you paint
Super-size what you shrank: the fries and the drank
Admired as a saint, defined by my rank
Combined with my strength, my time and my length
I'ma iron out the kinks; yes, I'm on the brink
And in the eye of my wink, I'ma retire in the bank

[Chorus]
Yeah, and I'm no quitter
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta
And I'm no quitter
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta
Yeah, I'm gon' get it, I'm gon get it
Yeah, I'm gon' get it, yeah
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta

[Verse 2]
Victory consistantly
Train all year to be the enemy's misery
No stress visibly, neither does it enter me
I think positively; you can't harm me mentally
Not physically, not spiritually; you'll never get rid of me
I am the epitome of "this is what you did to me"
Nothin's what you did for me, nothin's what you give to me
I take whatever I'm visualizing, now break all of the limiting
Now shake all of the gimicking, the fakery, the trickery
"Nurse, how sick is he?" "Worse, I am sickening!"
I'll be at the finish line first, "how quick is he?"
I'ma make sure they mention me for the next century
I ain't with the bickering, I am full of dignity
I am full of energy, pull out the inner me
Or bull after dinner meat, I stood in the winter heat
It could be the end of me, but good be defending me

[Chorus]
Yeah, and I'm no quitter
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta
And I'm no quitter
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta
Yeah, I'm gon' get it, I'm gon get it
Yeah, I'm gon' get it, yeah
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta

[Verse 3]
I'm allergic to cheatin'
I hate failure and I'm in love with achievement
Above and beneath it, a hug when I greet it
My eyes on the prize and I love when I seek it
Done with the speakin', begun with the preachin'
Now pray, until I am one with the deacon
Now play, until I have won whatever we win
I play, until I have won, and then I re-win

[Chorus]
Yeah, and I'm no quitter
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta
And I'm no quitter
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta
Yeah, I'm gon' get it, I'm gon get it
Yeah, I'm gon' get it, yeah
'Cause I'm a go, I'm a go, I'm a go getta

[Intro]
Yeah
Drought 3
Hear my chains? Haha
That mean I'm balling, bitch!
Haha
If you didn't know
If you wasn't informed, or something like that
This is Da Drought 3
And um... Check this out

[Verse 1]
Yeah, imagine waking up out your sleep to them pistols blasting
And if the witness is dead, there's no trial
If you didn't know then, ho, well, you know now
And I don't mean basketball when I say, "I don't know y'all"
Money, money, money, money boost my morale
Play with my money, money, money: O.K. Corral
I like a bitch with a apple-bottom like Vokal
The top is at my fingertips like I ain't got no nails
I got blood brothers, bitch; I ain't got no pals
I make a girl get low, like I ain't got no L's
I'm a paper-chasing dog, check my toenails
And I never miss a game, no Shaq O'Neal
More like Brett Favre, just like Brett Favre
I been shot two times; just wipe that off
But I thank You for putting me right back, Lord
And to You, Father, I would give my life back for it
That knife, that sword; that gun, that war
Make your so-called "soldiers" just run like Gore
Yeah—Frank, that is, from San Francis'
And I got more banana clips than chimpanzees
Ten addresses, and I dresses
Like I thinks I'm the motherfucking best there is
And I'm about to bubble, and she catch that fizz
And I'm straight from Claiborne, nigga; just ask Liz
Check your neck—there ain't a crook like this
From the city where the judge throw the book at kids
Burner in school, in my bookbag, hid
Talk stupid at lunch, and we having your ribs
If you are not home, then we having your kids
And if you can't come up with half, I'll send you half of your kid
Back to the balling, extravagant crib
I'm on the toilet watching Martin, just laughing and shit
Don't know why I get high, but I get high
I get high, like, every single day
You do shit that them other women can't
Mary Jane, what is it you done to me? Yeah
I pop a beat and start rolling
And then, I smoke it like a muh'fucking stogie
Peep how I wrote it:
I was rappin to the "ding-ding-ding-ding..." Fuck it

[Hook]
Get high, screw the world
And that's that, hahaha
I need all my funds, yeah
All my money, baby, haha
Black diamonds and pearls
Believe that, hm
I made "Bling Bling," and my chest look like a mural
I'm nuts—just call me "Squirrel"

[Bridge]
My fetish is the girls
But the women—not the girls
Act your age, not your shoe size
Maybe we can do the twirl
I'll be the Prince of her pearl-tongue
Earring in her pearl-tongue
If she come, let her girl come
Give her a pill, give her girl one

[Verse 2]
"Party time, excellent"—yup, Wayne's World
Campbell's Soup on the wrist, just call me "Earl"
Lil' Marl, don't shoot 'em, you heard?
I get high, my words slur, I start callin 'em "Merl'"
"Hey, Merl', light that 'firre'"
And I know this old, but I'm really "Hot in Herre"
I went with the Phantom, my niggas copping the Spurs
My hand's in the pot—I'd rather eat and stir

[Hook]
It's I against the world
And I'm strapped! Yeah
I bring all my guns
Shoot mothers, fathers, babies—damn!
Black handguns to serve
We could see, but we are so blind to the signs
They trying to lose the world

[Bridge]
And we will walk right up with our guns, yup
Hand in hand, yeah
We'll march right after the drum
But I don't mean no band

[Outro]
Nigga, Drought 3!

[Pre-Hook 1: Young Jeezy]
Just got a hundred of that brown paper bag money
You niggas really wanna talk money?
Shit real, that's all I can tell 'em
Just wrap 'em up good so the dogs can't smell 'em

[Hook: Dre]
Brown Paper Bag (thank God for that)
Brown Paper Bag

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
Thank God for those days, thank God for those nights
Though it might seem wrong, thank God for that white
They used to call me the Pyrex kid
A.K.A. Young Arm & Hammer
In the kitchen with the pots, yeah I work the glass
Hard on 'em, pimp, yeah I work 'em tass
And when they came in, we unpacked 'em all
Broke 'em all down and unwrapped 'em all
Just two words nigga, duffel bag
I just know it so well, can't help but brag
Gold Mouth got 10, Mel Man got 3
It's just your luck the rap game got me, hold up

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Here we go again
Just spent a hundred of that brown paper bag money all on Timbs
And the bad **** all on him
'Cause the cars that he drives are all foreign
The game is mine, I'm so far in
I'm speaking with an accent you just caught wind
Can't even relax in my room
That brown paper bag money push my mattress through the roof
This for my **** gettin' brown paper bag money
This for my strippers gettin' black plastic bag money
We talkin' 'bout that bad money
That IRS can't tax money, ya dig me?

[Pre-Chorus: Rick Ross]
Just made a hundred of that brown paper bag money
I thank God for the mil' he prepared for me
Take care my fam and my little dog, money
Thank God for that brown paper bag, that

[Chorus: Dre & Rick Ross]
Brown Paper Bag (Thank God for that)
Brown Paper Bag  (Boss, c'mon)
Brown Paper Bag  (Thank God for that)
Brown Paper Bag  (We the best)

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Just pulled over in my CM 5
Big bottle on the dash, hope he let me slide
Got 20 in the trunk, you can bet me five
20 minutes and they dump, I'mma let these fly
We the best! Look at what we drive
Got pic-nic tables on my lap, gettin' high
In the back of the Maybach, and it cost five
Hundred thou and a nigga spent that with a smile
Stackin' numbers at alarmin' rates
White house, still move a brick of raw in a day
I'm that Bin Laden boy, I'll bomb ya state
I ain't come to stay, I got a postbar and a date
Two million in a bag, ain't one to brag
You don't know the feelin' when the villain peelin' in a Jag
Just starin' at the ceilin', ten woman at your pad
I was at the center, now I see villain just in fact, I'm a Boss

[Pre-Hook 3: Lil Wayne]
Just spent a hundred of that brown paper bag money
It feels good to be Young Money, Cash Money
Rehab, I'm addicted to fast money
I got stacks of rubber bands up in that

[Hook: Dre]
Brown Paper Bag (thank God for that)
Brown Paper Bag
Brown Paper Bag (thank God for that)
Brown Paper Bag

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Practice make perfect, I'm relaxing at rehearsal
I'm a mothafuckin' professional, like Herschel
Walker, the talk of the game, is I
But I wonder will they still be talkin' after I die
But that's not important, money's more important
And understand I been in that water like I was snorklin'
Understand I been in that water like I'm a dolphin
Miami, Khaled took me in like an orphan
Why did they start him, now they can't park him
I go into the booth and just change like Clark Kent
Lamborghini dark tint, philly blunt cigar scent
I'm by myself cause niggas run they mouths like auctions
T-Street's my brother, FeFe's my brother
And we stay on point like a fucking box cutter
Ya heard what I say, mothafucka did I stutter
With my brown paper bag here to represent the hustle, I'm out

[Pre-Hook 4: Fat Joe]
Coka baby, man you know I already had money
Definition of that brown paper bag money
Try front and I'll zip you in a bag, money
For the cash, I'll blast anybody, that

[Hook: Dre]
Brown Paper Bag (thank God for that)
Brown Paper Bag
Brown Paper Bag (thank God for that)
Brown Paper Bag

[Verse 5: Fat Joe]
Ya'll niggas want coca music
Lacostra Nostra flow, show ya how to do this
Pin it so easy, a caveman could do it
Nigga, we simply the best, don't confuse it
I confuse it, critics be hating
Best album yet, don't give me the same rating
I'm waiting top of Rap Rushmore
Etched in stone, right beside Pun's noy
Unsure, anythings possible
4 mill spent, bought out the Art Basel
I'm Picasso, in a Versace suit
Don't worry my nigga, Khaled I got you
Not just cause I want to, cause I got to
Put the squad on your back, the impossible
It's only logical to spit it from the heart
Brown paper bag, who else but Joe the God?
That

[Hook: Dre]
Brown Paper Bag (thank God for that)
Brown Paper Bag

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
My homie Mali used to stay, 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet, a school full of Stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they'll leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand
Keys in his hand, reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Ellesses, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How'd he get the cash? The day his father passed away
Left him with a lil' somethin', sixteen, he was stuntin'
Al B. Sure nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lake Shore, girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least 'bout eighty
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back-back then-then, if you had a car
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love to play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'd take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lincolns and Auroras, we was hurtin 'em all
With the girls a lot of flirtin' involved, but dog
Fuck all that flirtin', I'm tryin' to get in some drawers
So, put me on with these hoes homie
He told me don't rush to get grown, drive slow, homie

[Hook: Kanye West]
Drive slow homie
Drive slow
You never know homie, about these hoes homie
You need to pump ya brakes and drive slow homie

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
What it do? I'm posted up in the parking lot, my trunk waving
The candy gloss is immaculate, it's simply amazing
Them elbows pokin' wide on that candy 'Lac
Trunk open, screens on, neons lit with fifth relaxed
I'm on a mission for dime-pieces and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them fours crawlin'? You see them screens fallin'?
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'
I'm leaning on the switch, sitting crooked in my slab
But I could still catch boppers if I drove a cab
A young Houston hard-hitter, all about the scrilla
Ridin' somethin' candy-coated, crawlin' like a caterpillar
I'm tipping on them fours, I'm jammin' on this Screw
I'm looking for them hoes baby, what it do? Drive slow homie

[Interlude: GLC & Kanye West]
Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes (drive slow homie)
If you're ridin' round the city with nowhere to go (drive slow homie)
Live today, cause tomorrow, man, you never know
You never know homie, might need some hoes homie
You need to pump ya brakes and drive slow homie

[Verse 3: GLC & Kanye West]
My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got more TV's in here than where I live
And that don't make no sense, but baby I'm the shit
And everything I flip, you know it's something serious
I got the custom grill, I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics, baby this evidence
You see a player flicking and how you ain't convinced
That you should gon kiss it, just a lil bit
I wear my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain
My canaries is gleamin' through my angel wings
They see me, hoes actin' like they seen a king
With that mean lean, smokin' on that finest Cali green
My woodgrain oak, I'm ridin' on Vogues
My cylinder quiet like tip-toes
I sold O's and this I know
When you see them hoes, lil homie drive slow

(Tony Williams harmony ad-libs)

[Verse 4: T.I.]
Looking at life through my rearview, all the problems I had
Could be seen a lot clearer after time had passed
Known for living so fast, they wonder how he don't crash
With 220 on the dash, and he constantly mashin'
"Why don't he slow down?" they be constantly askin'
But me and the fast lane is like metal and magnets
Now I ain't trying to say that this the way of the masses
But it's so hard to change, I love this shit with a passion
Since me and C were cuttin' class, and showin' our ass
Shooting out in broad day in the middle of traffic
I remember sellin' crack faster than I could bag it
Just sharin' my past with you, shawty, I ain't e'en braggin'
Me and Cap got life, them other folk got blasted
Had a partner O.D. and after this all happened
Life the only thing that kept a pimp from crying and laughing
Then the Lord smiled on me at the end of the madness
I never thought that I'da made it this far rappin'
For introducing the youth to what we now call "trappin'"
Considered now a classic, who'd've imagined?
Me in Milano getting models in next year's fashion
So nowadays, they can call me old-fashioned
But it's way too much cash to see blue lights flashin'
So I guess the moral of this here class is:
Life about who make it, not about who make it the fastest
Drive slow homie

[Outro: Kanye West (Chopped & Screwed)]
Yeah, bumpa bumpa bump bump
Drive slow homie
Drive slow homie
You never know homie, might need some hoes homie
You need to pump ya brakes and drive slow homie
Drive slow homie

[Intro]
You just popped in the Kanye West
Get Right for the Summer workout tape
And ladies if you follow these instructions exactly
You might be able to pull you a rapper, a NBA player
Man, at least a dude with a car!
So, first of all, we gonna work on the stomach
Nobody wants a little tight ass

[Verse 1]
One, and two, and three, and four, and get them sit ups right, and
Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
Give head, stop, breathe, get up, check your weave
Don't drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
Pick up your son, don't disrespect your seed
It's a party tonight and ooh, she's so excited
Tell me who's invited: you, your friends and my dick
(Ah!) What's scary to me is
Henny makes girls look like Halle Berry to me
So excuse me miss, I forgot your name
Thank you, God bless you, good night I came, I came, I came

[Chorus]
It's been a week without me
And she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothing to talk about
Unless she's talking about freaking out
Then maybe we can work it out
Work it out, work it out
Work it out, work it out now
Maybe we can work it out

[Verse 2]
Ooh, girl, your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
My name Kanye from the Jigga set, Twista said "Get It Wet"
Ooh girl your breath is harsh!
Cover your mouth up like you got SARS
Off them tracks yea I bought them cars
Still, kill a nigga on 16 bars
We ain't sweating to the oldies, we juking to a cold beat
Maybe one day girl we can bone
So you can brag to all your homies now
But I still mess with a big girl, if you ain't fit, girl, I'll still hit, girl
One and, you brought two friends, ok, three more now hop in the Benz
Four door: do you know the difference between a five, six, seven, eight?
All the Mocha Lattes, you gotta do Pilates
You gotta pop this tape in before you start back dating
Hustlers, gangstas, all us ballas

[Chorus]
It's been a week without me
And she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothing to talk about
Unless she's talking about freaking out
Then maybe we can work it out
Work it out, work it out
Work it out, work it out now
Maybe we can work it out

[Interlude: Jill, Lasandra, Ella-May & Kanye West]
Hi, my name is Jill, I just want to say thanks to Kanye's workout plan. I was able to pull a NBA player. And like now I shop every day on Rodeo Drive. I just want to say, thank you Kanye! Woooo! Woooo!—Woooo!

My name is Lasandra, and I just want to say that since listening to Kanye's workout tape, I was able to get my phone bill paid, I got sounds and 13's put up in my Cavalier and I was able to get a free trip to Cancun. And what's most importantly is that I ain't gotta fuck with Ray-Ray's broke ass no mo'

Work it (Mo')
Juke it (Mo') Pump it (Mo')
Chi-Town (Mo') Let's go (Mo')

My name is Ella-May from Mobile, Alabama, and I just want to say since listening to Kanye's workout tape, I been able to date outside the family, I got a double wide, and I rode a plane—rode a plane—rode a plane

Thanks to Kanye's workout plan
I'm the envy of all my friends
See, I pulled me a baller man
And I ain't gotta work at the mall again

[Interlude: Bosko & (Kanye)]
(Lemme break ya wit' a piece of)
My favorite workout plan (Oh, oh, oh)

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
That's right, put in work, move your ass, go berserk
Eat your salad, no dessert, get that man you deserve

[Interlude: Bosko & (Kanye)]
It's Kanye's workout plan
I said it's Kanye's workout plan (Ladies and gentlemen)

I want to see you work out for me
Whoa, yeah, whoa, yeah
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do, yo

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson & Kanye West]
I know you see me now, right now (You see me now, right now)
I know you see me now, right now (You see, you see)
I know you see me now, right now (Haha, yeah)
I know you see me now, right now

[Bridge 1: Beyoncé & Kanye West]
I got my suit and tie, and I don't know if y'all know
Well maybe y'all do, or maybe y'all don't
But I don't really care, it's how we on it all the time
So I'ma get my money, let's go

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Now I'ma need you to kill the hypocrisy, this is an aristocracy
I'm Socrates, but my skin more chocolatey
What's up with who? That's old news
I'm in a speedboat, in my boat shoes
Huh? I swear my whole collection's so cruise
I might walk in Nobu with no shoes
"He just walked in Nobu like it was Whole Foods
That nigga crazy, I told you"
Immature adult, insecure asshole
If you fall on the concrete, that's your ass fault
If you pass on a Kan' beat, that's your last fault
Get what you ask for, I swear that your ass slow
She got a big booty but she couldn't drop it as low
'Til you take your last ho and rope up all the cashflow
When you gettin' money they be all up on your ass, yo
When you gettin' money cops don't let a nigga pass, go
Straight to jail yo, in a hellhole
Right next to Lucifer, tell 'em I said "Hello"
Ask if I'ma be there soon and tell him I said "Hell no"
Yo what you say when your people get outta jail, huh?

[Bridge 2: Beyoncé & (Kanye West)]
My niggas is home
I guess I got everything, everything I want
(Let's go shopping, dog, let's celebrate)
But I don’t, no matter how good it gets, it’ll never be like before
(Free Weezy though)
No women in the crowd, screamin' and it’s loud
Doin' things not allowed and I swear it’s going down right now
(You know what it is)
I know one thing, my mama would be proud
And you see me lookin' up
'Cause I know she’s lookin' down right now

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson]
I know you see me now right now
I know you see me now right now
I know you see me now right now
I know you see me now right now

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Pour the champagne, let your watch show
Shorty got a man watch, wrist look colossal
I admit my first watch was a Fossil
Now I’m in the Louvre, lookin' for fossils
'Tention to detail is so uncanny
And the whips on the Sprewells, it’s so un-Camry
Somebody need to put us on camera
The world of Rollies and everyone families
Stay Jordan fresh, suits and Ferraris
Cute, your shorty watch Barney's, we head to Barneys
End up at Marni, Giorgio, service from Sergio Tacchini
Lamborghini, the chain throw off the vertigo
I know the flow just hit a hellified vertical
This the Christ year, last year was magic: 32
Lyrically, can’t none of y’all murder Ye
'Cause y’all raps ain’t got no vertebrae
I got style, ask June if she heard of me
I killed the fur last Paris, raised the murder rate
First of all, we all know the beats is
Like a mix between Fergie and Jesus
Imagine the direction of this immaculate conception
Every one of His Majesty’s swim parties is pageantries
Cannonball off the divin' board when I am bored
All my homies GDs, but I am Lord
Rap god, Greek mythology
And this life too crazy to think logically
Here’s somethin' that you could use as an analogy
My life is like a child’s illusions become reality

[Bridge 3: Beyoncé & Kanye West]
Now go get my throne, 'cause I don’t wanna stop
I just go in my zone, and I’ma make it hot 'til it’s time to go
When it’s time to go, where you tryna go?
You better act like you can see me now

[Interlude: Kanye West]
Exactly
Rosewood
Aha, aha
I know you see me, I know you see me
I know you see me, it's like I'm 3D
I know you see me, I know you see me
I know you see me, it's like I'm 3D

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Man, today I am the freshest in the world, but that's the obvious
Damn, I look so sexy, and you look like a pile of shit
When I told my ex I love her, she went and married another
And changed her whole name up, you a Yugoslavi' chick
"Be successful," that's what Dad told me
So everything I D-O, now I OD
They say G.O.O.D. Music like the new Miami Heat, shit
Comparin' them to us, man they gotta add Kobe
Whoadie, holy moley went, from G-Shockin' to Rollie
From the D, coppin' in Beverly Hills, I'm Axel Foley
Nah, nah, baby boy, you Jody, in the party, they all know me
Yeah, I saw your ass in line, boy, you was lookin' like the old me
Presidential suit, my girls Michelle and Chanel
She gave me designer, uh, she keep it au natural
I say it again, I'm chasin' cheese, dodgin' rat traps
Chasin' pussy you might end up with a Kat Stacks
Nasty trick, you's a nasty chick
Ooh, you know I like that nasty shit
Got it made in every way, gettin' paid every day
What Sean sound like, 'Ye protégé?
He sound like he a pro to me
"I know Kanye a jerk," how could you say that?
He rode me and my mama 'round in his Maybach
What kind of jerk is that? What kind of jerks is y'all?
Fuck it if he a jerk, I bet you jerk him off
Bet you take it off or chase him through the mall
We workin' twice as hard, so everything come in twos
Double drinks, double girls
We be gettin' paid like W-2
Rep Westside, throwin' up Ws
"We love you Sean," I love you too
Ooh-ooh, you know I do

[Outro: Kanye West]
Hey, feel like one of those old R. Kelly joints, right?
I bet they put me back on the cover of Ebony now
I know Jet magazine calling right now
You looking good today too, I like that
You got your new suit on and she got the extra cute on
I know you thinking, “This that Yeezy we all love”
I’m back, baby, we back, baby
Uncle Charlie, by the way
And I’ma let you finish, but I got Beyoncé on the track
That’s what it is
Black excellence, baby
This is the elite
We the greatest in the world baby, we the greatest in the world!
Hahahahaha
Yeah, Lex Luger, No ID, Yeezy
Uh

[Verse 1]
In my mind, I'm a fighter, my heart's a lighter
My soul is the fluid, my flow sparks it right up
An arsenic writer, author with arth-r-itis
Carpal tunnel, Marshall with Start-Shit-Itis
Hardheaded and hotheaded, bullheaded and pigheaded
Dick-headed, a prick, a big headache
I'm sick, quick-witted; for every lyric spitted
There are six critics who wait for me to slip with it
So, quick—this dynamite stick, bury the wick
It's gonna explode any minute
Some lunatic lit it
And it's not Nelly, do not tell me to stop yelling
When I stop selling, I'll quit, so stop dwelling!
I am not failing, you fuckers are not ready
‘Cause I got jelly, like Beyoncé's potbelly
This is destiny; yes, money, I'm off running
So get off of me, I'm not slowing or softening

[Hook]
No apologies! Nah, suckers, I'm not sorry
You can all sue me, y'all could be the cause of me
No apologies! Y'all feeling the force of me
No remorse for me, like there was no recourse for me
Nah, no apologies! Not even acknowledging you at all
'Til I get a call that God's coming
No apologies! Laugh, fuckers, it's all funny
I can spit in your face while you're standing across from me
No apologies!

[Verse 2]
My head hits the pillow, a weeping willow
I can't sleep, a pain so deep, it bellows
But these cellos help just to keep me mellow
Hands on my head, touch knees to elbows
I'm hunched over, emotion just flows over
These cold shoulders are both frozen, you don't know me
I keep saying it, I can't stress it enough
So keep playing it, and stand next to the subs
I choke mics like asphyxiation
When I'm strangling my own throat masturbating, haha!
Fuck, yeah, I'm a basket case
And I'll master this rap shit 'til my ass gets wasted
'Til my assassination
'Til I'm slain 'cause of some fag's infatuation
.44 mag's a fascination
A taste for disaster, and if that's the case, then—

[Hook]
No apologies! Nah, suckers, I'm not sorry
You can all sue me, y'all could be the cause of me
No apologies! Y'all feeling the force of me
No remorse for me, like there was no recourse for me
Nah, no apologies! Not even acknowledging you at all
'Til I get a call that God's coming
No apologies! Laugh, fuckers, it's all funny
I can spit in your face while you're standing across from me
No apologies!

[Verse 3]
This song isn't for you, it's for me
A true MC, it's what he'll do just to see
If he still has it and if his skills mastered
He's able to spill raps long after he's killed, that's a—
Real MC, got you feelin' me
Whether willing or unwillingly, you still agree
As long as there's still this hunger and will in me
Then expect a longer life expectancy
I'd be a savage beast If I ain't had this
Outlet to salvage me inside
I'd be exploding, soaked in self-loathing
And mourning, so I'm warning you: Don't coax me
It's silly, I’m really a sheep in wolf's clothing
Who only reacts when he gets pushed, don't be—
Fooled; the press blows up this whole thing
It's stupid, they don't know, ‘cause they don't see
That I'm wounded, all they did was ballooned it
I'm sick of talking 'bout these tattoos Cartoon did
That's why I tuned it out, I'm sick of duking
And they can suck my dick while I'm puking
And you, too, you can—

[Outro]
Expect no sympathy from me
I'm an MC, this is how I'm supposed to be
Cold as a G, my heart's frozen
It don't even beat, so expect no apologies
Expect no sympathy from me
I'm an MC, this is how I'm supposed to be
Cold as a G, my heart's frozen
It don't even beat, so expect no apologies

Down in the dirty south to be exact
Gettin money gettin money is a well known fact

Welcome to Atlanta, GA

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
I hit heavy in the trunk so I say I'm heavy hittin'
My car just got a Jheri curl the paint's still drippin'
My whip so clean I turn lovers into haters
Then I make 'em come around like curl activator
There are none greater; I'm the freshest on the scene
Rap gaming Jones I'm the freshest on the team
But really I'm a coach spitting game to the players
And I'm yellow with that purp like I came with the Lakers
I'm out to get that paper, the mule and the acres
I'm repping for the rich, red, monkey bathing apers
So catch a contact like you inhaled Luda vapors
Cause rappers get smoked like I rolled in some paper
Put 'em in a ash tray throw away the roaches
Move them out my pathway show them who's the dopest
I bring home the bacon and protect it with the toasters
Like the lens on your camera, fuck, boy I'm so focused!

[Hook]

Welcome to Miami, FL

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
20 grand in the left
Another 20 in the right
Got my wallet in the back
And that thing packed tight
Credit cards don't need 'em
All the birds won't feed 'em
While I'm sitting at the table just me and family eatin'
E-class on the cell; discussing another mill'
Gucci Gucci bottle empty, daddy needs a refill
Up in frevay I'm standing on the bar
If it ain't a black truck it's a quarter million Maz'
I'm in love with kush and Kate Fox
If ya need anything hit the safe deposit box
Outta town for a month
Came home with a duffel that was one point something
Getting brain and I love it
Pimp, ask Khaled. Lobster salad
Mobster acknowledge I'm popping in Dallas
Pop collars I touch hoes like crep flow
The game in a choke hold
No I won't let go

Welcome to Houston, TX

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Well I done said said it before
But I guess it's best to repeat it
Dirty south in the building
With no losses we undefeated
Anybody think they can beat it must be on sherm
Got the streets on fire like raw scalps with a perm
I'm big worm and that big body slayer
Rip it open and you keep playing with my money
Smoke it like I'm a joke
I go for broke on the boulevard
In the paint and have a bitch nigga sliced from his eyes to his tank
You think I came at 225 pounds of trouble
Can't find a triller nigga than me if you had the Hubble
I been repping the dirty and I ain't finna to slow down
So if you ain't with it get out the way it's about to go down
You can get your issue like your ass subscribed
And when we ride there's nowhere that your ass can hide
Nigga try to come at me crooked like burners play craves
Have you running up north like a runaway slave
Played pussy your bluff even if it's your period
The dirty south niggas take their money too serious nigga

Thank you for coming. We hope you enjoyed your stay. And please, come again

[Verse 1]
I told you I would show up screaming out "FNF" 'til the world blow up
They said I was so finished, I told 'em its show business
Meanin there's no business 'less Fiasco's in it
Disrespect the dress code; wear my street clothes in it
Measured, sold, and clothed in it
Opened up closed, after I entered and drove in it, like uhh

[Hook]
Only fear God
Know the weapons of the weak
The weakness of the heart
And never fall asleep

[Verse 2]
Roll in it, music bumpin, windows tinted
Through the good neighbourhoods and all of the woes in it
Exerted control in it
Seen it come and go, stolen and sold in it
Diamond and gold plated
Fountain of youth, dippin my toes in it
Bounce in the booth, spit it like Skoal in it
Putting my heart and my soul in it
Cause

[Hook]
Only fear God
Know the weapons of the weak
The weakness of the heart
And never fall asleep

[Bridge]
Once upon a time, not long ago
When the pusher man creep, where they live life po'

[Verse 3]
With fifteen in the clip and one in the hole
Hallway wall full of R.I.P.'s, some some of us know
None of us know the makers of the toast
Like the bottom of the stove that was used in the murderin' of the scroll
Heart colder than Edy's
Won't let the seedy city defeat me
Rub me out like genies, won't concede til I'm graffiti
Nigga what

[Hook]
Only fear God
Know the weapons of the weak
The weakness of the heart
And never fall asleep

[Verse 4]
I done bellowed, said "What up?" to the reaper
Hell met like Riddell, then high-water, hello
To the five-year-old gunshot hearer, I hear ya
Clearer than the invisible man in the mirror
Cheer up, I put it on the bars like beer nuts
Put a bug in they ear, so from here up, they hear us

[Hook]
Only fear God
Know the weapons of the weak
The weakness of the heart
And never fall asleep

[Bridge]
Once upon a time, not long ago
When the pusher man creep, where they live life po'

[Verse 5]
I put it on my grandmomma's daughter
I microphone control with the soul of slave hummin "Wadin in the Water"
I author like D.W. brother, like a hustla'
God place me in ya armor, I prescribe no partners
I do it for the hood like a parka
But tell my niggas not to shiver
Only time we quiver like a archer is

[Hook]
Only fear God
Know the weapons of the weak
The weakness of the heart
And never fall asleep

[Verse 6]
Here we are now, entertain us
Change don't change us
Ever since the game trained us
We came up like worms in the rain
I dream my chain became a loose noose that was used to hang us
So now, my insane brain, my 32 teeth
And two feet creep like its Elm Street
Cause

Only fear God
Know the weapons of the weak
The weakness of the heart
And never fall asleep

Uh
We just gonna keep it going and going
Until I feel completed and happy about it, you know
Uh
Opus of a ghetto boy who grew into a project man
Brewster Place, he used to stick his scissors in his sockets damn
Clear that Project Runway
Cause this is where my rocket lands
Ain’t got no problems, Houston
I A.K.A. then rocket land
Events recent that lit a fire under him like pots and pans
Rockets and I up in the sky like helicopter cams
And you down there in the traffic jam
From here I’ve seen a bunch of fake shit like avid wrestling fans
Came up from the bottom of the eye exam zoom
Now I’m like the biggest G up in the room
Still hard to see me like the truth on TV
Or the roof from the sidewalk
I don’t flow, I ceiling
My mama said they need me
Cause I’m made from the best stuff on earth
Like Snapple Tea Leaves
They glass is half full so I spit into them like Celie
No longer G, now you can see me
But your letter's still under my sea like seaweed
C and G but nothing bout me CG
It’s all real, none of this is green screen
Shut Up and Let Me Go just like The Ting Tings
I’m feeling like a Mac
Standing around a bunch of PCs
I’ve rocked it from the shottas to the soccer moms
Try to stop what’s going on
You’ll see the back of my hand like the tops of palms
I’m balling like the tops of pawns
Circle of influence getting bigger like the ripples on the tops of ponds
Sure-footed and War Headed like the tops of bombs
Domino-in niggas
Delivery is Papa John's, Little Caesar's
Burning down your Pizza Hut
Plaque collection building cause
I don’t brush my teeth enough
Yeah, Crack is wack and reefer sucks
You might think this deep as fuck
But this is like my weaker stuff
They ask is this his day-to-day cause this is like a week to us
Mic is shy and speakers blush
I is shy and he is up
I correct, me is up
No we is up - cause its like two of me
And each of us rapping acid, eat this up
A-Town down, peace is up
New York to East Coast is cuffed
West Side riding
Lot of niggas' salty cause
Cause I be overseas and tough
Everything seamless, WorldStar never seen this
NahRight gotta stream this, mother fucking genius
Brave and fly, you backbone-less and wingless
Bunch of chickens on the strip
I’m coming for they fingers
Till what they throwing up is meaningless
Chilly Chill you seeing this
This didn’t make MTV’s list
Finish fingers, eating wrist, feeding frenzy and shit
Succotash suffering
Chicken-Frikasee'en this
A beat eating media blitz
Pace is getting feverish
Pain is growing Seaver-ish
These the peppers Peter picked
Things are at their easiest
Real Compton city G’in it
But I’m from Chicago, house lights bravo
(*Applause*)
Yeah
I'm just playing
Internet
Check, check, check, check, check

[Verse 1: Eminem]
These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care, he's
A problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out (Bitch!)
'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stockin' cap
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go

[Chorus: Steven Tyler & Eminem]
(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely ‘cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate (Huh-uh)
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you (Yep), journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, B
It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you! (Bitch!)

[Chorus: Steven Tyler & Eminem]
(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Sing that shit!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 3: Eminem]
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued
See, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they wanna get one ‘cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up, ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (Ha-ha!)
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it ‘cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on
Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, and we can—

[Chorus: Steven Tyler & Eminem]
Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Chorus: Steven Tyler & Eminem]
Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

This is, this is, this is, this is
We are not the same, I am a Martian
We are not the same, I am a Martian
Greetings from Planet Weezy
We will begin transmission in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

[Chorus: Dre]
Phone home! Weezy
Phone home! Weezy
Phone home! Weezy
Phone home! Weezy
And if you feel like you're the best
Go 'head and do the Weezy-We, and
Phone home! Weezy
Phone home! Weezy

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
We are not the same, I am a Martian
And I'm hotter than summer rain like Carl Thomas
Lock, load, ready to aim at any target
I could get your brains for a bargain like I bought it from Target
Hip hop is my supermarket
Shopping cart full of fake hip hop artists
I'm starving, sorry, I gotta eat all it
And I'll be back in the morning

[Chorus: Dre]
Phone home! Weezy
Phone home! Weezy
Phone home! Weezy
Phone home! Weezy
And if you feel like you're the best
Go 'head and do the Weezy-We, and
Phone home! Weezy
Phone home! Weezy

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
We are not the same, I am a alien
Like Gonzales, young college
Student, who done just flipped the game like Houston
I'm used to promethazine in two cups, I'm screwed up
And you ain't shit if you ain't never been screwed up
Flow so sick make you wanna throw your food up
Ice water chest, and my wrist like a cool cup
Two twin clippers, I give your ass a crew cut
I get bread like cold cuts, you know what?
Your girl go down fast, come up slow, but I never slow up
Weezy!

[Chorus: Dre]
Phone home! Weezy
Phone home! Weezy
Phone home! Weezy
Phone home! Weezy
And if you feel like you're the best
Go 'head and do the Weezy-We, and
Phone home! Weezy
Phone home! Weezy

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
They don't make 'em like me no more
Matter of fact, they never made it like me before
I'm rare, like Mr. Clean with hair
No brake lights on my car rear
I never had life and I never had fear
I rap like I done died and gone to heaven, I swear
And yeah, I'm a bear, like black and white hair, so I'm polar
And they can't get on my system 'cause my system is the solar
I am so far from the othars, I meant others
I just eat them for supper, get in my spaceship and hover, hover

[Chorus: Dre]
Phone home! Weezy
Phone home! Weezy
Phone home! Weezy
Phone home! Weezy
And if you feel like you're the best
Go 'head and do the Weezy-We, and
Phone home! Weezy
Phone home! Weezy

(Let me put you on game)
(Let me put you on game)

[Verse: Lupe Fiasco]
Don't you know that I run this place
And I've begun this race, must I rerun this pace
I'm the reason it's become this way
And their love for it is the reason I have become this praised
(Let me put you on game)
They love my darkness, I make them heartless
And in return they have become my martyrs
I've been in the poem of many a poet
And I reside in the art of many a artist
(Let me put you on game)
Some of your smartest have tried to articulate
My whole part in this, but they're fruitless in their harvest
The dro grows from my footsteps
I'm the one that they follow, I am the one that they march with
(Let me put you on game)
Through the back alleys and the black markets
The Oval offices, crack-houses, and apartments
Through the mazes of the queens
The pages of the sages and the chambers of the kings
(Let me put you on game)
Through the veinses of the fiends
A paper chaser's pager, yo, I'm famous on the scene
One of the oldest, most ancientest things
Speak every single language on the planet, y'all mean?
(Let me put you on game)
I am the American dream
The rape of Africa, the undying machine
The overpriced medicine, the murderous regime
The tough guy's front and the one behind the scenes
(Let me put you on game)
I am the blood of this city, its gas, water, and electricity
I'm its gym, and its math, and its history
The gunshots in the class
And you can't pass if you're missin', G
I taught them better than that
I taught them aim for the head and hope they never come back
I'm glad your daddy's gone, baby, hope he never comes back
I hope he's with your mother with my hustlers high in my traps
(Let me put you on game)
I hope you die in his trash
I can't help it, all I hear when you're crying is laughs
I'm sure somebody find you tied up in this bag
Behind the hospital, little baby crack addicts had
(Let me put you on game)
Then maybe you can grow up to be a stripper
A welfare-receiving prostitute and gold digger
You can watch on TV how they should properly depict you
The rivers shall flow with liquor, quench your thirst on my elixirs
(Let me put you on game)
I am the safe haven for the rebel runaway and the resistor
The trusted misleader, the number one defender
And from a throne of their bones I rule
These fools are my fuel, so I make them cool
(Let me put you on game)
Baptize them in the water out of Scarface pool
And feed them from the table that held Corleone's food
If you die, tell them that you played my game
I hope your bullet holes become mouths that say my name
Cause I'm the--

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
The Cool
Turn me up, uh, yeah

[Verse 1]
He came back, in the same suit that he was buried in
Similar to the one his grandfather was married in
Yes, he was still fresh to death
Bling, two earrings, a chain layin' on his chest
He still had it cause they couldn't find it
And the bullets from his enemies sat like two inches behind it
Smelled the Hennessy from when his niggas got reminded
And poured out liquor in his memory, he didn't mind it
But, he couldn't sip it fast enough
So the liquor was just fillin' the casket up
Floatin' down by his feet was the letter from his sister
Second grade handwriting simply read, "I miss ya"
Suit jacket pocket held his baby daughter's picture
Right next to it, one of his mans stuck a Swisher
He had a notion as he laid there soakin'
He saw that the latch was broken, he kicked his casket open
And he...

[Hook]
This life goes passing you by
It might go fast if you lie
You born, you live then you die
Oh oh oh oh
If life goes passing you by
Don't cry
If you're breaking the rules, making your moves
Paying your dues, chasing the cool

[Verse 2]
Not at all nervous as he dug to the surface
Tarnished gold chain is what he loosened up the earth with
He used his mouth as a shovel to try and hollow it
And when he couldn't dirt-spit, he swallowed it
Working like a, hmm, reverse archaeologist
Except, his buried treasure was sunshine
So when some shined through a hole that he had drove
It reflected off the gold and almost made son blind
He grabbed onto some grass and climbed
Pulled himself up out of his own grave and looked at the time
On the watch that had stopped, six months after the shots
That'd got him in the box, wringing Henny out his socks
Figured it was hours because he wasn't older
Used some flowers to brush the dirt up off his shoulder
So, with a right hand that was all bones
And no reason to stay, he decided to walk home
So he...

[Hook]
This life goes passing you by
It might go fast if you lie
You born, you live then you die
Oh oh oh oh
If life goes passing you by
Don't cry
If you're breaking the rules, making your moves
Paying your dues, chasing the cool

[Verse 3]
He begged for some change to get him on the train
"Damn, that nigga stank" is what they complained
Tried to light the blunt but it burst into flames
Caught the reflection in the window of what he became
A long look, wasn't shook, wasn't ashamed
Matter of fact, only thing on his brain was brains
Yeah, and gettin' back in his lane
Doin' his thang, first he had to find something to slang
Next stop was his block, it had the same cops
Walked right past the same spot where he was shot
Shocked that some lil' niggas tried to sell him rocks
It just felt weird, being on the opposite
They figured that he wasn't from there so they pulled out
And robbed him with the same gun they shot him with
Put it to his head and said, "You're scared, ain't ya?"
He said, "Hustler for death, no heaven for a gangsta"
And...

[Hook]
This life goes passing you by
It might go fast if you lie
You born, you live then you die
Oh oh oh oh
If life goes passing you by
Don't cry
If you're breaking the rules, making your moves
Paying your dues, chasing the cool

[Outro]
Yeah, uhh
Cool!

[Intro]
I swear, if I see this nigga, I'mma kill him
I'm, going, to kill, him
So! Make a nigga suffer
You know what I'm saying?

[Chorus]
My man said life ain't easy
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy
Streets be all like "Feed me, feed me"
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy
My man said life ain't easy
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy
Streets be all like "Feed me, feed me"
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy
My man said life ain't easy
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy

[Verse 1]
Hey, he had a whole lot of cheese
Plus he was a mack, had a whole lot of steez
Made a lot of niggas fat, gave a whole lot of Gs
Grams, man, he had a whole lot of these
And he would let you hold, like, a whole lot of ki's
Even if you lose some, he would give you new ones
Twice the bread, it's like he had two buns
And he had a whole lot of seeds
Even his kids had meals for reals
Some rich small fries wrapped in paper since they was lil
Catch up, nigga

[Chorus]
My man said life ain't easy
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy
Streets be all like, "Feed me, feed me"
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy
My man said life ain't easy
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy

[Verse 2]
He was a heart breaker
And a law shaker
If it was about caking, he was a partaker
International, he would take trips
Bon voyage, that's how hard he was fishing for the chips
So greedy, never gave to the needy, that's what some say
The way he shunned all the bums hanging in the subways
He called 'em fruits and laughed at 'em
Delivery man, on the pick-up
Drive through and throw a bag at 'em
And it was hard to understand him sometimes
Making a killing, the way he had 'em standing in line
Like

[Chorus]
My man said life ain't easy
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy
Streets be all like, "Feed me, feed me"
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy
My man said life ain't easy
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy

[Verse 3]
Lovers call him King, haters call him Clown
He would say "Bite me, that's the way it's going down"
He was having thoughts that maybe he should retire
Went to Church on a Sunday and saw a deep Friar
Said he had beef and people want him dead
He loved the hungry ones, was only scared of the Feds
He lived the fast life, couldn't get his path right
The Friar just told him 'bout the Hooters that he had last night
"Turn yourself in to the paddy wagon", said "No"
Bacon wouldn't take him, had the Pigs on the payroll

[Chorus]
My man said life ain't easy
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy
Streets be all like, "Feed me, feed me"
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy
My man said life ain't easy
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy

[Outro]
To be continued on another menu, ya dig?
Will he give up his life of crime or will he stay?
This and other adventures on Lupe Fiasco's next album, L.U.P.E.N.D.... Yezzir!
(Yo... So stupid)
My man said life ain't easy
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy
Hey

[Intro: Matthew Santos & Lupe Fiasco]
Tonight, tonight, tonight
The stars are aligned, and the planets colliding
The plan is arriving, and she's out there smiling
The fear is upon us, the skies tried to warn us
The parents are goners, no children to mourn us
It's driving me crazy, this war is my lady
We've lost all our babies, and God is amazing
The tick of the timer, the slip of the rhymer
The pimp and the riser
Your cross, there you'll find her
Hey, hey

[Chorus: Matthew Santos]
Death is on the tip of her tongue and
Danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight
Death is on the tip of her tongue and
Danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Disease, the virus is spreading in all directions
No safe zone no cure and no protection
No symptoms define the signs of an infection
No vaccines, remedies, and no corrections
Quarantine the dreams and seal off the connections
Don't let them in, not a friend, not a reflection
Everybody's got it and want you to have it next and
Don't accept them if you want to stay as an exception
No pill can heal the ill of this
Sickness, some are still in doubt of its existence
Some call it forgiveness and some call it the vengeance
Some say it's an exit and some say it's an entrance
The poor say the rich have the cure
The rich say the poor are the source
Revolutionaries say it's psychological war
Invented by the press, just to have something to report
Some say the first case came from a maternity ward
Some say a morgue, some say the skies, some say the floors
Whores say the nuns, nuns say the whores
And everybody is sure
The scientist say it only affects the mind
The little boy said it only affects the girls
The preacher man said it's going to kill off the soul
A bum said it's gonna kill the whole wide world

[Chorus: Matthew Santos]
Death is on the tip of her tongue and
Danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight
Death is on the tip of her tongue and
Danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
"Believe!", so say the neon signs by the
Loudspeakers repeating that everything is fine;
A subtle solace to demolish the troubled conscience
Of a populace with no knowledge and every freedom denied
Every dream is designed and broadcasted
From the masters to the masses
From the antennas on the top of the shrines
Refine the receiver and plant it
During the panic and short it, it reports back
Everything in your mind, everything is lying
Everything is dying, everything is a rule
Everything is a crime, everything was here then
Everything rewind the new
Weather burned the feathers off everything flying
(And she likes it, and she loves it)
The sadness, the madness, the bad shit
The lavish, the fastest, the clashes, the ashes to ashes
Everything intertwined
My femme fatale my darling fraudulent angel
Once caught her changing the batteries in her halo
Receipt for her wings and everything that she paid for
And the address to the factory where they made those
Scientist said she's all inside my mind
The little boy said "What happened to all the girls?"
The preacher man said "She's going to kill off your soul."
The dope boy said "It's the whole wide world."

[Chorus: Matthew Santos]
Death is on the tip of her tongue and
Danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight
Death is on the tip of her tongue and
Danger's at the tip of her fingers
Streets are on fire tonight

[Intro]
I know, I know but I gotta get up outta here, you know?
I gotta go pay these bills, I got a show to do, you know?
One time, for your mind

[Chorus]
Let's go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago, man
Wherever I go she go

[Verse 1]
I love her, and I hate to leave her lonely
Ring-ring went the iPhone, it was my homie
He said, "Let's hit Japan, if we can make 'em jam
We can make a hundred grand, spend it in the south of France"
Nothing further; I jumped, grabbed my Goyard trunk
Got ready to walk it out like Unk in my John Lennon Chucks
That's when I heard murder
"You're killing me, you're filling me with sorrow
Sunrise, goodbyes, and missing you tomorrows"
I turn to see my dream, love supreme queen
Meanest thing on the scene cry
I drop my bags in a flash, that's faster
Than 180 on that dash, shirt to dry her tears
And wipe the rain from my dear like Dasher
You's the dame who's the username to all my passwords
The reason I get fly is Ibn Jasper
I even keep your picture in my passport
Love, love

[Chorus]
Let's go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago, man
Then we can land in the motherland
Camel-back across the desert sand
And take a train, to Rome, or home
Brazil, for real
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes

[Verse 2]
So let's keep it real, all in together, "Free Chill"
Tell the stewardess to throw a movie on the reel
Heat up my kosher meal, exchange my dollar bills
Lean back in my first class seat and sleep
Don't wake me 'til I land
Where they barely understand what I speak
But they nod to my beats
I tell my fans who I am and they stand
And they clap, they applaud, they love me, my God
Otsukaresama deshita, or maybe au revoir
A spree on Saint-Honoré, then back to Charles de Gaulle
So I can get home and tell her everywhere that I been, and
Everything that I done, and
Tell her that she's the one, and, umm

[Chorus]
Let's go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago, man
Then we can land in the motherland
Camel-back across the desert sand
And take a train, to Rome, or home
Brazil, for real
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes

[Verse 3]
Guess who's back in the house
With a bunch of souvenirs and a smile for your mouth
I really missed you, each and every night I kissed you
In my dreams 'fore I went to sleep
To la-la land to count them sheep
I swear you're looking prettier than ever
It's got to be a prophecy for us to stay together, evermore
For better or, less or poor
Or worth our weight in buried treasure, X's on the shore
I know my world tour's like war to you
But Ian said, "Aloha", and Harley said, "Cheers"
Julian said, "Bonjour", Big O was like, "Yeah!"
Amanda and Le Messie want to know when we going there
Edison sends his love, so does the rest of the club
Of the international playboys and playgirls
But I revoke my membership, all for My Tenderness
She said, "Pursue your interests 'cause even if I'm ticketless
I'll be there, by your side
In your heart, and on your mind"
So, as I taxi down another runway
I gotcha, who loves you bae
Now bring it back now

[Chorus]
Let's go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Fall in love in Chicago, man
Then we can land in the motherland
Camel-back across the desert sand
And take a train, to Rome, or home
Brazil, for real
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes

[Intro]
La, la la la, la la la

[Chorus]
Hey, this is a song for my haters
Yeah, y'all got me feeling like the greatest, yeah
Hey, this is a song for my haters
Hey, hey, y'all got me feeling like the greatest
Ha, bitch I'm about to blow up

[Bridge]
Uh-huh, say what?
Bitch I'm about to blow up
Hey, I came up, I warmed up, the next up
Bitch I'm about to blow up

[Verse 1]
Huh, uh, now don’t it sound legendary?
Live enough to resurrect the dead and buried
This for niggas who ain't satisfied with secondary
This for my sisters who ain't satisfied with secretary
Uh, I’m blowing up, and bitch, I’m still me
But what's the cost to live your dream, do you feel me?
Everything glittering ain't what you think it will be
Funny how money, chains and whips make me feel free
I’m starring in this bitch, and yeah, I write the show
Fuck the haters, I’m headed to the place you like to go
They say, "What you fighting for?" The game is on life support
And Gary Coleman just passed, life is short

[Pre-Chorus]
Bitch I’m about to blow up
Look I’m about to blow up
Yeah, got to the club early
Just to get in free and wait for hoes to show up
Heh, but now it's bottles at them tables
Bring the models boy, I'm 'bout to pour up
Uh-huh, you know what?
Huh, bitch I’m about to blow up (La)
Left side, left side, hey (La la la)
Right side, right side, uh-huh (La la la)
Left side, left side, hey (La la la)
Bitch I'm about to blow up (La la la)

[Hook]
Hey, this is a song for my haters
(Bitch I'm about to blow up)
Yeah, y'all got me feeling like the greatest, yeah
(Ha, said I'm about to blow up)
Hey, this is a song for my haters
(Uh-huh, bitch I'm about to blow up)
Hey, hey, y'all got me feeling like the greatest, yeah
Bitch I’m about to blow up

[Verse 2]
Mama say I should reconsider law school
That means I wear a suit and bend the truth and feel awful
Hell naw, got a degree, but what that cost you?
You make a good salary just to pay Sally Mae
That's real as ever, ducking bill collectors like Jehovah’s witness
When they showed up at your door at Christmas
Was broke as dishes, tryna let it go
Hit the club, she drop it low, lower than my credit score
Account overdraft, what I got this debit for?
So much debt, it got me drinking, thinking "Bitch I better blow"
I better blow, these hoes ain't checking
For no nigga with no vehicle, you border like Mexico
Heh, hey baby girl, what it look like?
And where ya head at? And what ya cook like?
She said, "Where your bread at? Or what your whip like?
You ain't got one or the other, well brother, good night"

[Pre-Hook]
Bitch I’m about to blow up
Look I’m about to blow up
Yeah, got to the club early
Just to get in free and wait for hoes to show up
Heh, but now it's bottles at them tables
Bring the models boy, I'm 'bout to pour up
Uh-huh, you know what?
Huh, bitch I’m about to blow up (La)
Left side, left side, hey (La la la)
Right side, right side, uh-huh (La la la)
Left side, left side, hey (La la la)
Bitch I'm about to blow up (La la la)

[Hook]
Hey, this is a song for my haters
(Bitch I'm about to blow up)
Yeah, y'all got me feeling like the greatest, yeah
(Ha, said I'm about to blow up)
Hey, this is a song for my haters
(Look I'm about to blow up)
Hey, hey, y'all got me feeling like the greatest, yeah
Bitch I’m about to blow up

[Verse 3]
Praise God, it’s hard to stay spiritual
How they got these niggas on the TV selling miracles?
You mean to tell me everything goin be fine
If I call your hotline and pay $29.99? (Shit)
Well damn, why ain't you say so?
Take this check and ask God to multiply all my pesos
And erase my number out the phones of these fake hoes
I saved her number just in case but now it’s case closed
To you niggas biting my flows and my subject matter
You’ll never be me partner so it don’t fuckin' matter
You try to be and your career will see funerals
And be you, that's when it sounds beautiful
Then maybe you can blow up
And maybe you can blow up
Shit, but you know what?
For now, bitch I’m about to blow up

[Intro]
Oh, it's music to my ears, oh man
How can I describe the way I feel?
Fucking great, man
Okay, let me see
How could I begin?

[Verse 1]
Locked in Mariah's wine cellar, all I had for lunch
Was bread, wine, more bread, wine and Captain Crunch
Red wine for breakfast and for brunch
And to soak it up, an in-between snack, crackers to munch
Mariah, what's ever happened to us?
Why did we have to break up?
All I asked for was a glass of punch
You see, I never really asked for much
I can't imagine what's going through your mind after such
A nasty break-up with that Latin hunk
Luis Miguel, Nick Cannon, better back the fuck up
I'm not playin', I want her back, you punk
This is Hello Kitty bedspread, Satin Funk
Mixed with Egyptian, with a little rap and punk
Zapp and Eric Clapton, Shaft, Frank Zappa, crunk
And yeah baby, I want another crack at ya
You can beat me with any spatula that you want
I mean, I really want you bad, you cunt
Nick, you had your fun, I've come to kick you in your sack of junk
Man, I could use a fresh batch of blood
So prepare your vernacular for Dracula acupuncture

[Chorus]
Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease?
For Pete's sakes, he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind
Half the time, when I rhyme, or blowing up like
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on
'Cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman holding a Glad—

[Verse 2]
You can be a permanent fixture in my lyrical mixture
I'm the Miracle Whip trickster
My signature sound, when a tube of lipstick's around
I'm bound to put it on in an instant, wow
Man, what an ensemble!
What an assortment of pharma–ceuticals
This beautiful pill dust in my palm, my
Cuticles get residue just from touchin' the bottle
Never knew I could remind me so much of my momma
I'll cut ya like Dahmer, pull a butcher knife on ya
The size of a sword, boy, I'm like the fuckin' Red Sonja
Get it stuck in your cornea, nice knowing ya, Norman
You're so fuckin' annoyin', drop the shovel, boy
You don't know what the fuck you're doin'
I ain't playin' no fuckin' more
Nick Cannon, you prick, I wish you luck with the fuckin' whore
Every minute there's a sucker born, snuck up on Malachai
Made the motherfucker suck on a shuck of corn
Shuck o', shuck o' corn, Chaka Khan
Hit Jason in the face with a hockey puck, and
Told him it's fuckin' on, man, what the fuck are ya doin'?
You're runnin' over the snowblower with the lawnmower
Blowin' your bagpipes from Baghdad

[Chorus]
Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease?
For Pete's sakes, he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind
Half the time, when I rhyme, or blowing up like
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on
'Cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman holding a Glad bag

[Verse 3]
In the bed with two brain-dead lesbian vegetables
I bet you they become heterosexual
Nothing will stop me from molestin' you
Titty-fuckin' you 'til your breast nipple flesh tickles my testicles
Is what I said to the two conjoined twins
How's it going, girlfriends? You needs a boyfriend?
You need some ointment? Just set up an appointment
Who's gonna see the doctor first? We'll do a coin flip
I just got my one-year sobriety coin chip
When the bad get going, how bad does the going get?
Baby, you shouldn't have any trouble rubbing groins with
Each other, especially when you're joined at the hip
I'm going to get the needle and thread from the sewing kit
And attempt to separate 'em and stitch 'em back at the loin, shit
Lure the little boy with the chocolate 'Chips Ahoy!' chip
Cookie, lookie, even took me a Polaroid pic

[Chorus]
Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease?
For Pete's sakes, he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's going through my mind
Half the time, when I rhyme, or blowing up like
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on
'Cause I'm gone, blowing on my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act like a madman holding a Glad bag
Oh, bagpipes from Baghdad

[Outro]
Hghum-day-li-laaa-aaa-aaa-aaa-aa-aah-aah
Hghum-day-li-laaa-aaa-aaa-aaa-aa-aah-aah
Hghum-day-li-laaa-aaa-aaa-aaa-aa-aah-aah
Hghum-day-li-laaa-aaa-aaa-aaa-aa-aah-aah

[Lil Wayne]
Hate is temporary, love is necessary
I went from eating pussy to eating commissary
Damn, I am the sickest, I need therapy
You can buy the answers but you can’t afford to question me
First off I don’t need you second guessing me
Jail is like third base: I’m coming home eventually
Still got shooters like hot tubs
Man I'm anemic: still got bloods
I’m in my cell reading fan mail
Wish I was in Amsterdam sipping Amstel
Thinking bout all of that pussy I can’t smell
Man they did me wrong; I feel like Nelson Mandel’
I shine too hard my lamp fell
My name still ringing: Alexander Graham Bell
I know you met damn, cause you know damn well
That I still got you open, open like a clam shell
Yeah, still fly on my hawk shit
My conversation stinks cause I talk shit
Stay in your lane you’re on that double-park shit
We eating at the top, get a spoon and a forklift
I got rap wrapped up like a gift
I’d be sober if if was a fifth
I’m feeling like Elvis – jailhouse rock
I’m not 2Pac, I’m the New Pac
Behind bars but the bars don’t stop recording over the phone
I hope the call don’t drop
Drizzy got the ball and I know the ball won’t drop
And I pray none of my kids never wanna be cops
Young Money get ‘em, Young Money got ‘em
The boss got his feet up, vacation on an island
Yeah and tell your girls send the kite up
And even if you don’t smoke motherfucker you gon’ have to light up

[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, I appreciate your patience tonight
It's been a moment since I've done some public speaking
I find nowadays it's, you know, best to keep quiet
But, uh, sometimes you just gotta let it out
Young Angel and Young Lion, you know what it is

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, look, I'm the property of October
I ain't drive here, I got chauffeured
Bring me champagne flutes, rosé and some shots over
I think better when I'm not sober
I smoke goodie, no glaucoma, I'm a stockholder
Private flights back home, no stop over
Still spittin' that shit that they shot Pac over
The shit my mother look shocked over
Yeah, but with a canvas I'm the Group of Seven
A migraine, take two Excedrin
I'm the one twice over, I'm the new eleven
And if I die I'ma do it reppin', I never do a second
I swear niggas be eyein' me all hard
And lyin' to they girls and drivin' the same cars
Sittin' there wishin' their problems became ours
‘Cause we have nothin' in common since I done became star
I done became bigger, swervin', writin' in my peers' lane
Same dudes that used to holler my engineer's name
One touch, I could make the drapes and the sheers change
And show me the city that I without fear claim
What I set seems to never extinguish
Coolest kid out, baby, word to Chuck Inglish
Count my own money, see the paper cut fingers
My song is your girlfriend's waking-up ringer
Heh, or alarm, or whatever
She be here at six in the morn' if I let her
But I never get attracted to fans
'Cause the eager beaver could be the collapse of a dam
I always knew that I could figure
How to get these label heads to offer him good figures
And me doin' the shows gettin' everyone nervous
'Cause them hipsters gon' have to get along with them hood niggas
It's all good, I'm goin' off like lights when the show's over
Make pasta, rent a movie, call hoes over
Rest in peace to Heath Ledger, but I'm no joker
I'll slow roast ya, got no holster
Wet glass on your table, nigga; no coaster
Burn bread everyday, boy; no toaster
G and Tez got a SIG, but I'm no smoker
They just handin' chips to me, nigga; no poker
I'm with it, Young Money, Cash Money soldier
My cup runneth over
The same niggas I ball with, I fall with
On some southern drawl shit
Rookie of the year, '06 Chris Paul shit
D-R., CJ, and Po, I see y'all
These cases don't work out, I hope we can agree on
Makin' enough to pay any Judge Judy off
First thing I'ma do is free Weezy, go

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
And I'd take probation
I don't want that T.I. and Vick vacation
Private plane, pick location
I'm goin' to the bank to make a big donation
Yeah, I don't stunt, I stunt hard
And if the food ain't on the stove I hunt for it
But in the meantime you can call me young Roy
Jones Jr. fightin' the drugs and gun charge
Shit, don't leave me unguarded
And I'm a cheesehead, word to Vince Lombardi
Word to Marky Mark, leave a snitch departed
All that blood like the Red Sea parted
My gun go crazy like it's retarded
Red light on it like it's recording
I ain't recordin', I'm just C-4in'
My currency foreign; we are in a league they aren't
Better dig in your pocket and pay homage
Better cover your eyes, your face fallin'
Watch the game from the side, I'm play callin'
No, I didn't say that I'm flawless
But I damn sure don't tarnish
My pistol got comments for your garments
I'm so high I can vomit on a comet
K-Y, no homo, I'm on it
Weezy F Baby, new born bitch
You know what they say 'bout when your palm itch
I'm gon' get money, money I'm gon' get
Young Money in your tummy and we gon' shit
And get that toilet paper quick, like when Bones spit
That's right, bitch, I'm back on my grown shit
That Audemars Piguet, no ice, just chrome shit
And your boyfriend softer than a foam pit
I scream, "Fuck the world with a long dick!"
Motherfucker, I'm me! Yeah, bitch, I'm me!
You niggas sweet, like the pussy in which I eat
Fireman burn down your entire street
So fly I'ma take off when I leap
Bye! And you can suck my wings
Stand on my money, headbutt Yao Ming
Put your hand in the oven if you touch my things
I'm shufflin' the cards, 'bout to cut my queens
But I ain't the dealer
House full of bitches like Tila Tequila
Yeah, I'm the man in the mirror
My swagger just screamin', motherfucker, do you hear her?
Yeah, Drizzy Drake what the lick read?
We make magic, boy; Roy and Siegfried

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Woo, Young Mula, baby
Yeah

[Produced by DJ Toomp, Kanye West, and Mike Dean]

It feel like NY, summertime Chi
Ah! (Now throw yo' hands up in the sky)
So I roll through good
Y'all pop the trunk, I pop the hood, Ferrari
And she got the goods
And she got that ass, I got to look, sorry!

[Bridge]
Yo, it's got to be 'cause I'm seasoned
Haters give me them salty looks, Lawry's
50 told me, "Go 'head, switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate and watch the money pile up"
The good life

[Chorus: Kanye West & T-Pain]
Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine

[Verse 2: Kanye West & (T-Pain)]
Welcome to the good life!

The good life, it feel like Houston
It feel like Philly, it feel like D.C
It feel like VA or the Bay or Yay
Ayy, this is the good life (Welcome to the good life)
Homie, tell me what's good
Why I only got a problem when you in the hood
(Welcome to the good life) Like I'm new in the hood
The only thing I wish, I wish a nigga would
(Welcome to the good life!) He probably think he could
But, but, I don't think he should (Welcome to the good life)
50 told me, "Go 'head, switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate and watch the money pile up"
The good life

[Chorus: Kanye West & T-Pain]
Now I, I go for mine, I gots to shine

(Ayy) ayy (Ayy), ayy
(Ayy) ayy (Ayy), I'm good

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Have you ever popped champagne on a plane, while gettin' some brain?
Whipped it out, she said "I never seen Snakes on a Plane"
Whether you broke or rich, you gotta get this
Havin' money's not everything, not havin' it is
I was splurgin' on Tryst, but when I get my card back
Activated, I'm back to Vegas (Welcome the good life)
'Cause I always had a passion for flashin'
Befo' I had it, I closed my eyes and imagined the good life

[Outro: T-Pain]
Ayy, it's the good life, better than the life I lived
When I thought that I was gonna go crazy
And now my grandmomma
Ain't the only girl callin' me "baby"
If you feelin' me now, then put yo' hands up in the sky
And let me hear you say
Hey, hey, ooh, I'm good!

[Spoken Word: Birdman]
Yeah shawty you know what I'm talkin' about
I'm peepin' these niggas out there slippin', lookin' like
They ain't 'bout money no mo' man, so uh fuck
You know what we gon' do huh, what we been doin' huh nigga
We gon' load up get a lot mo' get a lot mo' and say fuck 'em nigga
Keep buyin' shit, keep fuckin' hoes
Loadin' up on mo' bitches
Then you know what I'm sayin', we gon' get greedy too nigga
I ain't never gettin' full
I'm full blooded with this grind
Yeah they don't understand lil nigga

[Verse 1: Lil' Wayne]
Murder capital, only key to survive is kill
If the elements don't murder you the riders will, for real
And niggas know I go hard to the fullest
Get involved and I got em playing dodgeball with bullets
Yeah, I got the sawed-off fully
In the Sean John hoodie, get fucked, you play pussy
Ha, we hit 'em up while they lookin'
And them body shots hurt, but the head shots took him
Damn, and if the red dot spot 'em then the hollow head got 'em
Knock his top to his bottom jack
Yeah, you see we grind from the bottom
Just to make it to the bottom at the very bottom of the map
Lil Weezyana piranhas everywhere you at
You gotta wear ya extra condom and a extra gat
Your bitch can get it for actin' like a man
And niggas in Pakistan ain't packin' like your man
I backwards hand your man on command
In front of niggas he cool with them boys on fan
I'm on hot, I adjust in different climates
Ducking the animal keeper runnin' with my primates
You ain't did it till you done it like in five states
Weezy hustle no blubber I put on weight
And in the drought I go on a diet and stretch more
Lose all that weight, leave a nigga with stretch marks
You don't even come up to a nigga chest pa' sub par
What the fuck they play it in the club for
Real shit I'm ducking bombs from a drug war
No religion but the cops swear that I'm a drug lord
Father forgive 'em for they know not who they pushin' Lord
Father forgive me if I have to send 'em to you Lord
I'm just tryin' dodge the shots they send to the God
They ridin' up highway to heaven boulevard
Damn, them niggas pussy and jive
Not even in a eye exam, they ain't lookin' for I
The A and the K will make your face crook to the side
Now when you smilin' everybody gotta look from the side
'Cause when you wildin' you ain't lookin' you just lookin' high
And when we hungry you look like pie
Sweet potato-ass nigga, you lemon merengue, apple custard
Cherry jelly, don't make me get the biscuit busta, yeah!
What up, Gizzle? You my distant brother
Real shit, nigga, same father, different mother
I skip the frontin' and stick to keepin' it trill
You not know me for nothin' other, I'm somethin' other
Than people you feel I'm deeper for real, I'm deeper than skills
My speeches can kill, rest in peace

[Spoken Word: Birdman]
Yeah, you underdig, shawty? It's all about one thing nigga
If you bout money, nigga, come fuck with us
If you ain't bout no money, get the fuck from 'round us, nigga
And whatever you 'bout, we 'bout it
However you wanna get, we can give it to ya, nigga
All runners, bitch, you underdig? Put your prints in, nigga
Put your feet down and your nuts on the concrete and let's roll

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
You sleep in the field for trying the dude
I'll bust ya head to the meat turn ya mind to food
Food for thought, think I ain't lyin' to you
I lie his body in grease, set fire to him
I tie his body in sheets put the tires to him
Make him feel the Escalade put his feet in the blades
Damn! I'm the heat in the blaze
And niggas keep they ways when I'm in the streets wit blay What!
My nigga hungry he'll eat the plate
And if I ask the homeboy'll eat ya face, yea!
And though he got me, you can ask I'm like a pool table
I keep the eight, my side pocket side ways
When I pop it leave a nigga sideways for five days
Birdman talk to 'em

[Spoken Word: Birdman]
Yeah nigga, I tell em, I'll tell em again shawty
If it ain't bout no money, get the motherfuck from 'round me nigga

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Check my swag, I travel like sound dawg
You play hard and I’m gravel like ground dawg
I'm underground, call me groundhog
Lay down laws, call me ground law
Don't confuse me with the law, naw
But just confuse me with my pa because I am the Birdman J.R
I ain't trippin' nigga, I play the corner like Ripken nigga
With the forty Cal Ripken nigga, rip a nigga
Flip your vehicle, split your windshield
Whack ya baby momma but I'll let the kid live
And people say that I am a kid still
'Cause the lil nigga still ride on big wheels
You feeling animal then come on and get killed
The Sig peel bandanas like bananas
Say I'm slight bananas I blow a weekend in Havana
In my Cabana wit my bottom bitch from Savannah
Man a train couldn't stop ya man
I man up and you not a man, I stand up say I got my land
I'm the man of my land, call it Lil-Weezy-ana
That's the new plan

[Spoken Word: Birdman]
Yeah nigga, you 'bout some money get at me nigga
That's the only way
Dumb shit we 'bout that get at me you undadig
Nigga roll solo, dolo nigga

[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's Cole, won't lie, won't stop 'til the race is won
Niggas who be rapping how real they are
Usually turn out to be the fakest ones
Carolina, where I made it from
Cole world, no blanket, son
Girls fast how Jamaicans run
Puffing on the city where the Lakers from: L-A, L-A, la la
So high, everything is a “ha ha” for me
Dreaming of the days of a drop 500
And a bad bitch that'll go to Popeyes for me
You can never tell me that I'm not hungry
If you ever felt what's inside my tummy
My mind wondering now, is my time running out?
Is the Lord up top with a stop watch for me?
Hope not, hope not, hope not, hope not

[Hook]
(My world is empty without you, babe)
Yeah, just trying to make it, my nigga
(My world is empty without you)
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
A wise nigga told me don’t chase that cash
Follow your heart, you’ll make that fast
Does a stripper love to shake that ass
Or does she wish to erase that past?
Got a nigga in her face, just gassed
Like “Baby girl, why you take this path?”
Stack in his hand, trynna make that last
All she thinking bout is how to take his last
Rub titties in his face and laugh
Gotta try not to look fake, in fact
A little more money, like a few more 20’s
When you let that nigga grab your naked ass
Okay, he’s gone now, roll her eyes when he whispers in her ear
“This ain't the life for you, baby, let me take you out of here 'cause..."

[Hook]
(My world is empty without you, babe)
Yeah, she like "nigga, yeah right"
(My world is empty without you)
"You know how much motherfucking money I'm making?"

[Verse 3]
Yeah, my niggas sit back, blowing the L
Only getting high 'cause we closer to hell
Niggas tryna live like Hova, but well
We broke and that dough coming slow as a snail
Hustle hard in the snow, in the hail
Hit the block like a postman with mail
My brother got knocked now they hold him in cells
My mom broke, but she posted the bail
Someway, somehow
Nigga feeling like the sun down even when the sun up
Hear the sound out the window of the gun bust
And you wonder why niggas keep the gun tucked
But this how niggas was brung up
A mother just trying to raise her son up
'Til a stray bullet got his lungs struck
And the Governor couldn’t give one fuck
While she singing

[Hook]
(My world is empty without you, babe)
Damn, told you niggas "Cole world, no blanket"
(My world is empty without you)
Tough luck, yeah

[Intro]
Uh
Something new

[Chorus]
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll

[Verse 1]
Niggas wanna try, niggas wanna lie
Then niggas wonder why niggas wanna die
All I know is pain, all I feel is rain
How can I maintain with that shit on my brain?
I resort to violence, my niggas move in silence
Like you don't know what our style is, New York niggas the wildest
My niggas is with it, you want it? Come and get it
Took it then we split it, you fuckin' right we did it
What the fuck you gon' do when we run up on you?
Fuckin' with the wrong crew, don't know what we goin' through
I'ma have to show niggas how easily we blow niggas
Lemme find out there's some more niggas that's runnin' with your niggas
Nothin' we can't handle, break it up and dismantle
Light it up like a candle just 'cause I can't stand you
Put my shit on tapes like you bustin' grapes
Think you holdin' weight then you haven't met the apes

[Chorus]
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll

[Verse 2]
Is y'all niggas crazy? I'll bust you and be Swayze
Stop actin' like a baby, mind your business, lady
Nosy people get it too, when you see me spit at you
You know I'm tryin' to get rid of you, yeah I know, it's pitiful
That's how niggas get down, watch my niggas spit rounds
Make y'all niggas kiss ground just for talkin' shit, clown
Oh, you think it's funny? Then you don't know me, money
It's about to get ugly, fuck it, dawg, I'm hungry
I guess you know what that mean, come up off that green
Rob niggas on Ravine, don't make it a murder scene
Give a dog a bone, leave a dog alone
Let a dog roam and he'll find his way home
Home of the brave, my home is a cage
And, yo, I'm a slave 'til my home is the grave
I'ma pull capers, it's all about the papers
Bitches caught the vapors and now they wanna rape us

[Chorus]
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop
Oh, no, that's how Ruff Ryders roll

[Verse 3]
Look what you done started, asked for it, you got it
Had it, shoulda shot it, now you're dearly departed
Get at me, dawg, did I rip shit? With this one here I flip shit
Niggas know when I kick shit it's gon' be some slick shit
What was that look for when I walked in the door?
Oh, you thought you was raw? Boom, not anymore
'Cause now you on the floor wishin' you never saw
Me walk through that door with that four-four
Now it's time for bed, two more to the head
Got the floor red, yeah, that nigga's dead
Another unsolved mystery, it's goin' down in history
Niggas ain't never did shit to me, bitch-ass niggas can't get to me
Gots to make a move, got a point to prove
Gotta make 'em groove, got 'em all like, "Ooh"
So 'til the next time you hear this nigga rhyme
Try to keep your mind on gettin' pussy and crime

[Chorus]
Stop, drop, shut 'em down, open up shop

[Outro]

Goosepimples couldn't shake me up out of the Y-M

[Intro: Tony Yayo & 50 Cent]
Shady!

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
We run it, yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
We run it, yeah, you know but you actin' like you don't know
You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho'
This flow is gon' bring mo' dough
Yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Now, homie, I say I run it, run it 'cause I'm in control
Hpnotiq, Hennessy, a couple shots of Patrón
I have you feelin' a'ight, I get you high as a kite
Party poppin', shawty says she comin' with me tonight
I ain't shoulder leanin', I ain't snappin' and poppin'
Either I'm bobbin' my head or I'm just standin' there watchin'
I'm a hustler, I hustle; you can tell that I'm paid
And I protect what I got, I'm in the house with my blade
Nigga, you front, you gon' get it, okay, now maybe I've said it
'Cause I want you to tridip, yeah, I be on that shidit
You should see when I'm stuntin', I flash the stones to be wantin'
Push the whip, see me rollin', you can tell that I'm holdin'
I'm just doin' my thang, you know the Unit's the gang
I got my grimy Shady with me, you front, you'll have to get me
Off yo' ass, I pay the lawsuit and laugh
Haha! It's not a big deal, it's nothin' but some cash
Let's go!

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know

Yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho'
This flow is gon' bring mo' dough
Yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know

[Verse 2: Eminem]
When me and Fif' got together to do this music
The more we became enveloped
We just developed a fellowship through it
It's no pretend shit, it's friendship, mi nemesis es su nemesis
Same for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images
But this shit is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out
When it's beef you just gotta know when to butt in and butt out
If there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it
It usually just evolves into one big brawl
And we all get involved in it
And we should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
And wear it like a badge of honor, pass it around and share it
And let it go to whoever's holdin'
The most current beef on their shoulders
And their soldiers got their backs 'til it's over
But tonight, we ain't come in here to beef with nobody
We came to party: Banks, Ca$his, and Mr. Ferrari
So it's Shady, Aftermizath, back in that ass, you izzask?
Come izzon, what kinda fizzuckin' quizzestion is that?

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Eminem]
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho'
This flow is gon' bring mo' dough
Yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know
Who run it? I said, you know but you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho'
This flow is gon' bring mo' dough
Yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know

[Verse 3: Ca$his]
Pistol play, ricochet, see where the victim lay
Slumped over bleedin'; J.F.K
HK 'til your chest plate cave
I'ma ride to the death, do you rep that way?
Forever I'ma be a Shady 7-4 gangsta
Pussy, I'll survive everything you got in that chamber
I thrive off of danger, jumpin' in all beef
You keep talkin' shit, now the squad have called me

[Verse 4: Lloyd Banks]
Enough holdin' back the steam, Em let off a magazine
Dappadon Cappa Queens, mixed in with Ca$his creams
Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see
Tellin' ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'm a fuckin' G?
I'm on automatic when I'm at it, start static
And you splattered, shit shattered, I'm a walkin' bitch magnet
Spit it how I live it, live it all-way to the limit
And I'm always on my pivot for my digits, you dig it?
See…

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
We run it, yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know
Who run it? You know, you actin' like you don't know
We run it, yeah, you know but you actin' like you don't know
You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho'
This flow is gon' bring mo' dough
Yeah, you know, but you actin' like you don't know

[Outro: Tony Yayo]
You know who this is
Shady, G-Unit, Aftermath
Lloyd Banks, Ca$his, Marshall Mathers, Ferrari F-50
It's a movement, you can't stop it
Talk of New York, Tony Yayo

[Chorus: Pooh Bear & (Snoop Dogg)]
Gather 'round, go a-head and stare
(You street folks don't need permission, my life's in hi-definition)
Listen with your eyes follow with your ears
(I don't need no intermission, my life's in hi-definition)

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
And my return (yeah!) is more like a re-up
I hold a whole like a tea-cup
World in one hand, while the other hand throw the peace up
My other hand throwing "We" without the e up (Westside)
I got like five more, man, I'm something like Shiva
In that Fall of Rome Number Four Deluxe
See, I've been around the world like the gnome
But I come from a zone where the homes are beat up
The folks, unknowns, and the stones all meet up
Police tap my phone, got my songs on speaker
Say he spat the poems, got their domes all geeked up
To get up on they thrones and become young leaders
Oprah put it on my culture, now, if that ain't wrong
Imus got it from the rhymers, now, if that ain't blown
They gave my man forty-four, now, if that ain't long
I put it all on my shoulders, now, if that ain't strong
I made it out alive from the streets of the west side C-H-I
Now, if that ain't home, you better tell 'em

[Chorus: Pooh Bear & (Snoop Dogg)]
Gather 'round, go a-head and stare
(You street folks don't need permission, my life's in hi-definition)
Listen with your eyes follow with your ears
(I don't need no intermission, my life's in hi-definition)

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
And in my flyness, I've become the hero and the sidekick
The rider and the nigga that'll ride with
In your ear like the maker of the "Vivrant"
Assalamu Alaikum to the maker of the "Vivrant"
Them other niggas I don't vibe with
Now I was 'bout three when the eyes went
But I could see everything that you trying to be
You can't hide it
While you coming out your throat like a Heimlich
I came up out the belly like an Hype script
Only my circumstance revised it
Hijacked the role and went and shot the pilot
I'm trying to go public so I can get to private
Then send Busy to go and get the pirates
Then hit Africa and try to fix the virus
Go back to the hood, tell Huggy, "Open the hydrants"
R.I.P Stack B., I'ma keep you alive, kid
Dressed in something so fresh and wonderful
F-N-F and S-N double O-P

[Chorus: Pooh Bear & (Snoop Dogg)]
Gather 'round, go a-head and stare
(You street folks don't need permission, my life's in hi-definition)
Listen with your eyes follow with your ears
(I don't need no intermission, my life's in hi-definition)

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Lupey and Snoopy, let's go wild
Tiptoe through the door, do it doggystyle
And tell all my chicks in Chi-i-cago
Lupey hit the Lotto, Snoopy hit the bottle
Dolemite tight, they bite, they might follow
Take this chill pill, lil nigga swallow
Recital is very homicidal
The big screen will capture it, 'cause it's high-definition
Listen, cooking collard greens in the kitchen
Them alphabet boys on a mission
If you ever get cash, you better get it quick fast
'Cause nowadays, niggas get to snitchin on yo' bitch ass
Even your boys best believe in them toys, out your game
Specially when a nigga know your real name
Blam blam with the blammer
Smile nephew, you on candid camera, film at eleven
Dressed in something so fresh and wonderful
F-N-F and S-N double O-P

[Chorus: Pooh Bear & (Snoop Dogg)]
Gather 'round, go a-head and stare
(You street folks don't need permission, my life's in hi-definition)
Listen with your eyes follow with your ears
(I don't need no intermission, my life's in hi-definition)

They call me King Hov, copy? Big balling is my hobby
So much so they think I’m down with the Illuminati
My watch do illuminate, my pockets are naughty
But I’m God body, you better ask somebody
I was born a God, I made myself a king
Which means I downgraded to a human being
You was born a Goddess, I made you my queen
Which mean we upgraded to Louis the thirteen
Hot tottie, her poppy like Cognac
Her momma like herb tea, we birthed a couple of sacks
And as the tea steeped, I creeped all in her tee-pee
We did it Indian style, had the girls speaking
In tongues, she like young, you hung, what you done done
Stop it, before you wake up my mom, I might (ah)
And now that you arrived, it’s time that I go
I'm so cold, I'm so cold

[Chorus: Usher & Ester Dean]
I'm like, whoa, Kemosabe, your body is my hobby
We freaking, this ain’t cheating as long as we tell nobody
Tell your girls you leaving, I’ll meet you in the lobby
I’m so cold, yeah, you that hot tottie
Hot tottie, hot tottie
I thought I'd never fall in love
Thought I'd never fall in love with you

[Outro: Usher & Jay-Z]
I'm so cold, I'm so cold (Hov!)
I'm so cold, I'm so cold (Hov!)
I'm so cold, I'm so cold (Hov!)
I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I need a hot tottie
Will you be my hot tottie?
She said she wanna make me better
She wanna make me better

[Verse 1]
She packed my bags last night, pre-flight
Zero hour: 9:00 a.m
And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then
I miss the Earth so much, I miss my wife
It's lonely out in space
On such a timeless flight

[Chorus]
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh, no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man!
Burning out his fuse up here alone
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh, no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man!
Burning out his fuse up here alone

[Verse 2]
Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
In fact, it's cold as hell
And there's no one there to raise them if you did
And all the science, I don't understand
It's just my job five days a week
A rocket man
A rocket man

[Chorus]
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh, no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man!
Burning out his fuse up here alone
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh, no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man!
Burning out his fuse up here alone

[Outro]
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time

[Verse 1]
On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night

[Verse 2]
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinkin' to myself
"This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

[Chorus]
"Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here"

[Verse 3]
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got the Mercedes bends, uh
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
That she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget

[Verse 4]
So I called up the Captain
"Please bring me my wine"
He said, "We haven't had that spirit here
Since 1969"
And still those voices are callin'
From far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

[Chorus]
"Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They livin' it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (What a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis"

[Verse 4]
Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice, and she said
"We are all just prisoners here
Of our own device"
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast

[Verse 5]
Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
"Relax," said the night man
"We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like
But you can never leave"

[Guitar Solo]

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to Heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to Heaven
There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

[Chorus]
Ooh, it  makes me wonder
Ooh, makes me wonder

[Verse 2]
There's a feeling I get when I look to the West
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking

[Chorus]
Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, really makes me wonder

[Verse 3]
And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-woahhh

[Verse 4]
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on

[Chorus]
And it makes me wonder
Ohh, woah

[Verse 5]
Your head is humming, and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow? And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one, and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll

[Outro]
And she's buying a stairway to Heaven

[Verse 1]
Am I changing right before your eyes?
Becoming someone you don't recognize
As if I was disguised, I'm on that shit as if I was the flies
I'm touching skies, no puffing lye
Man these songs that I made in my bedroom and shit
Goin' finally give a nigga leg room in the whip
From a Civic to a seven must've died and went to heaven
Like a passenger on 9/11, please go find a reverend
You see I promised that I'd never change
But that was way before I made the dough and met the game
Say hello to Miss Thang, I forgot yo name, she yellow
And even white women want a nigga, Othello
I'm balling with nuggets, like fuck it I'm Carmelo
Now the crib got much rooms, Portobello
She drop it low and then she bust moves for the fellow
I sit your ass down like you was playing a cello
See, you niggas hated and I levitated further
Knew I would kill the game, premeditated murder
So if it comes down, may the best man win
No sweat like a headband then, nigga

[Chorus]
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen
You know it can't get no better for me
No, it can't get no better for me
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen
You know it can't get no better for me
No, it can't get no better for me

[Verse 2]
I'ma kill the game and invite witnesses
No death penalty, I'm giving life sentences
Like keep grinding boy, your life can change in one year
And even when it's dark out, the sun is shining somewhere
Yeah, look here I paid dues
My own worst enemy so fuck it, either way I can't lose
808's so my south niggas feel me
Light-skinned it so the house niggas feel me
She catch me creeping out your house she'll kill me
Is it worth for what's under that blouse?
My heart'll turn pitch black and cold if I split with my girl
If I could gift-wrap the globe, I would give you the world
But, do you love me like you used to?
Even though I ain't that nigga that you're used to
Remember back when I was broke? You would fix me
Do you prefer the broke me or the rich me?
The broke me couldn't buy you meals, not even a value meal
And now I pay for everything, how you feel?
Mixed feelings 'cause now all the chicks feeling him
You gotta adapt though, I'm never going back

[Chorus]
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen
Hey, you know it can't get no better for me
No, it can't get no better for me
Where I'm from, if you ever seen what I seen
Hey, you know it can't get no better for me
No, it can't get no better for me

[Outro]
I can't keep running away
I can't keep running away
I swear I'm coming back one day
Hey
What if I'm wrong
And I ain't got what it takes
Then all them people that was counting on me
Boy won't you climb down the mountain for me

[Intro]
Ugh
Arms

[Verse]
Ayo, it’s Weezy Motherfucking, easy with the hating
Bitch, I’m in the building, you just decorating
I’m just detonating, then I get blatant
More dangerous than internet dating
Scoob got the cameras on, so I gotta show off
I'll put your sister on, I'll knock your bro off
Weezy spit snowballs, catch it in your face bitch
Good-Game Wayne, man, I deserve a Naismith
Cook 'caine game flow, dope in the vein flow
I only be smoking the purple out the rainbow
Stronger than Drano, your boyfriend a lame-o
And if you stay with him, then y’all in the same boat
Deep-Water Carter, fishing for a dollar
You can join the salad, I’m splitting your tom-a-ta
Ball 'cause I gotta, you’ll love me in the morning
I told her I'm a king, them other niggas Prince Charming
She love to rock my mic, she say there's nothing like performing
Man, I'm in love with her grill, George Foreman
Forewarning: Young Money’s armed
And we can shoot it out, I got the money drawn
Yeah! Take that to the bank with you
I rock my hat to the side like I paint pictures
Smoke weed, talk shit, like Lane Kiffin
Whole country in recession, but Wayne different
Huh, and I’m a Maybach rider
Haven’t drove it one time, I got a cool Black driver
Can't walk around with guns, I got a dude that got 'em
Don’t worry if I'm shootin' as long as you don't get shot (Arms)
And I'm a beast, I'm a pitbull
I get my ass kissed, I get my dick pulled
I—I'm a beast, I'm a big bull
I got my money right, I got my clip full, haha
Yeah, it’s like, seven in the morning, nigga
I’m up for whoever the opponent, nigga
Stop the track—let me relish in the moment, nigga
Now, bring that motherfucker back, 'cause I’m zoning, nigga
I go hard like Rafael Nadal
And if the bitches worth having, then I bet we have 'em all
And man, I'm so high, it's like an everlasting fall
And I’m charging these hoes like women basketball
Ugh! I bet that chopper get his mind right
Leave a hole in his chest like a lion bite
Superhero car, like I crime-fight
I see big cheese, you niggas blind mice
Ugh, T-Streets still roll with me
Still sticking to the script, like Nicole Kidman
Need the man hit? We are those hitmen
He stopped running; the bullet holes didn’t
Ugh, basically, I’m still a monster
'Til the fat lady sing—I come to kill a opera
Y'all too plain, I'm a helicopter
My words keep going, like a teleprompter
I’m a asshole—wipe me down, bitch
I get big checks—Niketown, bitch
Yeah, mean mug, Bobby Brown shit
And the flag red, like clown lips (Arms)
Ugh, T, I can't stop goin'
Drop my best shit, like the Cowboys dropped Owens
I’m the best to ever do it, motherfucker, I know it
No Ceilings, Goddammit, now the fucking sky showing, ugh!

[Outro]
Hahahahaha!

[Intro: JAY-Z]
Is this thing on?
Oh, I thought they silenced us, Ye
Power to the people

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
We livin' in that 31st century, futuristic fly shit
The penthouse is the projects and everybody flies private
New watches (You know what time it is), watch us (You see us)
They can't stop us, the prophets, biatches!

[Chorus: Kanye West, JAY-Z & Kobe]
No one man should have all that power (Yeah)
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours (Yeah)
Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the power
No one man should have all that power

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Rumble, young man, rumble
Life is a trip, so sometimes, you gon' stumble
You gotta go through pain in order to become you
But once the world numbs you, you'll feel like it's only one you
Man, you got the power to do anything you want to
Until you ask yourself, "Is this what this all comes to?"
Looking at life through sunglasses and a sunroof
But do you have the power to get out from up under you?
Fuck all these labels, fuck what everybody wants from you
They tryna Axl Rose you, welcome to the jungle
To be continued, we on that Norman Mailer shit
In search of the truth even if it goes through Taylor Swift
Tell her this!

[Chorus: Kanye West, John Legend & Kobe]
No one man should have all that power
Yea-ey-yea-ey-yeah-ey!
Oh oh (And they say) yeah-ey (And they say)
Oh oh (And they say) yeah-ey (And they say)
Oh oh (And they say) yeah-ey (And they say)
No one man should have all that power

[Bridge: Kanye West]
Now when I walk in, everybody do the "Power" clap
Clap, clap, clap
Fresh for the club, I just took a half an hour nap
Clap, clap, clap
I seen people go crazy when the whole world in our lap
Clap, clap, clap
My socket was out the plug, now it’s time to get the power back
Clap, clap

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I seen people abuse power, use power
Misuse and then lose power
Power to the people at last, it’s a new hour
Now we all ain't gon' be American Idols
But you could 'least grab a camera, shoot a viral
Hanh! Take the power in your own hands
I’m a grown man, doing my grown dance
I don’t stop until I see the end, my vision clear, bitch
I’m on my Van Gogh, I don’t hear shit

[Chorus: Kanye West & John Legend]
No one man should have all that power
The clock's tickin', I just count the hours
Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the power
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours (Ey-yeah!)
Oh oh (And they say) yeah-ey (And they say)
Oh oh (And they say) yeah-ey (And they say)
Oh oh (And they say) yeah-ey (And they say)
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay (The power)

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
Now everything I'm rhyming on cause a Ramadan
Been a don, praying for the families lost in the storm
Bring our troops back from Iraq, keep our troops out of Iran
So the next couple bars, I'ma drop 'em in Islam
They say "As-salamu alaykum", say "Wa alaikum as-salaam"
That's no Oscar Mayer bacon, you should run and tell your mom
Now the question is, how we gon' stop the next Vietnam
Keep Flex out of Korea, 'cause you know he drop bombs

[Break: Swizz Beatz]
Showtime!
Ayo Yeezy, man, stop playing with these people, man
They want see you act all crazy in this motherfucker, man
Take that jacket off and go crazy on them niggas, man
You know what I’m talking about? (I got the power!)

[Verse 5: Kanye West & Swizz Beatz]
What do it mean to be the boss? (Oh!)
It mean second place is the first one who lost (Oh!)
The crucifixion, the being nailed to the cross (Oh!)
Truth or fiction, it’s a hell of a cost
Do the dishes! (Bounce!)
I’m about to hit that Jeff Gordon (Ayy!)
Michael Jordan, the only one more important (Ayy!)
But I be feeling like Jordan when I’m recording (C-c-c)
'Cause every time I record, I dunk and slap the boards
I don’t know what these rappers gonna do afterwards (Oh!)
Prol'ly spaz like I might do at the awards (Right!)
Huh, I got the whole crowd going crazy (Ayy!)
Homie, I should be rewarded (Woo!)
Gettin' money, Yeezy, Yeezy, how you do it, huh? (Woo!)
Eating Wheaties, drinkin' Fiji, being greedy, huh (C-c-c)
Don’t even think you can allude to the rumors (C'mon!)
I’m immune to the boos, I’ma prove to you losers (Huh?)
It’s all in timing, nigga (Get 'em!)
See, I dreamed my whole life that I could rhyme with Jigga (Get 'em!)
Now Jay my big brother and Bey my lil' sister (Get 'em!)
And excuse me, but, you can’t see my lil' sister (Hands in the air!)
Number one sound across the board, hey (Oh!)
Number one now and forevermore, hey (Oh!)
Number one rule is, "Niggas, don’t hate"
Maybe I’ll drop the album... nah, y’all gotta wait (Oh!)
And on the net, they showing pictures of my Cali place
My Maybach in NY but it still got the Cali plates
All my old girls know that I’m the one that got away (Woo!)
I think about 'em Christmas and play some Donny Hathaway (Ayy!)
And keep my bulletproof-hater coat on
Chill, Ye, Ye, chill! Chill, chill, chill!
Looking at some photos that I’m looking crazy dope on (Yah!)
Hand up, talking shit, yeah, I get my Pope on
And go home with something to poke on (Woo!)
That’s what Dre said, but this what 'Ye said (Right!)
How 'Ye doing? Who 'Ye screwin'? (Huh?)
That’s for my dick to know, before you get to know him
She ain’t give you ass, that pussy fictional
I gotta give her the eviction no-
-tice, "Get yo’ ass out, bitch, vamonos" (Oh!)
Five seconds to the song end, we getting close (Hah?)
I got the power, motherfucker, if you didn’t know

[Outro: Swizz Beatz]
Chill, chill, chill, man
Chill, 'Ye, chill, chill, chill
Shit's burned up already
It's over

[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah, girl
Can you hear that? It's playing our song
Are you sleepy? Take a nap
You're not afraid of the dark, are you?

[Verse 1]
You hear the beat as it makes ya not want to go to sleep
I knock on Dakota's door; it's locked, so I go to creep
'Round the back with binoculars, not 'cause I wanna peep
But because I'm hungry, she smells like tacos, I wanna eat
Visions of hot chocolaty marshmallows, all so sweet
With sugar plums; oh, look
Here comes Marshall, he's on your street
He's placing hot, smoldering charcoals beneath your feet
Now walk on 'em; he's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek
Like a Thanksgiving turkey, a holiday ham
Cinnamon sprinkled on toast, strawberry marmalade jam
Flavor my favorite graham crackers with JonBenét Rams'
I guess a modern-day Jack the Ripper is all that I am

[Chorus]
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
(My music box)
But I can hear you, my love, you keep calling me
(My music box)
Although we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me
(My music box, my music box)
So once you call, I come, I will answer
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
(My music box)
I hear my music box playing a song for me
(My music box)
So won't you twirl around and do a whirl for me?
(My music box, my music box)
And would you be my private little dancer?

[Verse 2]
I almost look comatose; who wants to be sober? Gross
I foam like a Doberman, mouth open, I overdose
Put coke up my nostrils in both my holes, then I plug my nose
My pupils quadruple in size, eyes are so bugged, I know
I put on my mother's makeup, get naked and run around
Wavin' the gun around, I think I'm down to a hundred pounds
There's thunder, I wonder how come it rains, but the sun is out?
The devil's upset with his wife, they must be sluggin' it out
I must be buggin' the fuck out, but what the fuck about?
Voices are leading me up to the attic, I love my house
They pull and they tug my blouse, the sound of a music box
Comes from inside a toy chest, but what do I do? It's locked
I pick it and open it, but it's stuffed full of human parts
I dig 'til I find it, I wind it up, and the tune just starts
It's playing a song, so beautiful, and the room is dark
The moon is full, I smell a funeral, guess I'll loom in the park

[Chorus]
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
(My music box)
But I can hear you, my love, you keep calling me
(My music box)
Although we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me
(My music box, my music box)
So once you call, I come, I will answer
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
(My music box)
I hear my music box playing a song for me
(My music box)
So won't you twirl around and do a whirl for me?
(My music box, my music box)
And would you be my private little dancer?

[Verse 3]
I'm fixated on asphyxiatin' and breakin'
This little chick's neck like a Pixy Stick
The sick, Satan-worshippin' bitches get horse whippings
I'm in the back, through the back door slippin'
Through the crack, leavin' the corpse drippin'
The mortician of love, sent from above
Forced entry, the more wenchy the more stingy I become
Been doing this for more than a quarter-century, I'm just numb
Am I dreaming, is it real? Someone pinch me on the buns
The time has come to tie her up, gotta roll me the ladder
I've had enough of the chatter
Climb up to the window, look at her
Then climb in slow to shatter her brain matter and batter her
With a bat; a matter of fact, that will splatter her
But before I do that, I'll have a chat to flatter her
Give her two compliments back to back, like "Tabitha
I'm your secret admirer, I'm back to ravish ya
So strong is your fight, but you're no match for Dracula"
Prolonging her plight as I go back to stabbin' her
Dismember her limbs, simple as that: cadaver her
Zoom in with the lens, then pan back the camera
Stand back, 'cause here comes your man Jack, so Pamela

[Chorus]
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
(My music box)
But I can hear you, my love, you keep calling me
(My music box)
Although we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me
(My music box, my music box)
So once you call, I come, I will answer
(My music box)
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
(My music box)
I hear my music box playing a song for me
(My music box)
So won't you twirl around and do a whirl for me?
(My music box, my music box)
And would you be my private little dancer?

Daydream
I fell asleep amid the flowers
For a couple of hours
On a beautiful day
Daydream
I dream of you amid the flowers
For a couple of hours
Such a beautiful day

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
As I spy from behind my giant robot's eyes
I keep him happy 'cause I might fall out if he cries
Scared of heights, so I might pass out if he flies
Keep him on autopilot 'cause I can't drive
Room enough for one, I tell my homies they can't ride
Unless they sitting on the shoulders, but that's way too high
Let's try not to step on the children
The news cameras filming this walking project building
Now there's hoes selling holes like right around the toes
And the crackheads beg at about the lower leg
There's crooked police that's stationed at the knees
And they do drive-bys like up and down the thighs
And there's a car chase going on at the waist
Keep a vest on my chest, I'm sitting in my room
As I'm looking out the face, something to write about
I still got some damage from fighting the White House
Just a

I fell asleep amid the flowers
For a couple of hours

Daydream
I dream of you amid the flowers
For a couple of hours

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Now come on everybody, let's make cocaine cool
We need a few more half-naked women up in the pool
And hold this MAC-10 that's all covered in jewels
And can you please put your titties closer to the 22s?
And where's the champagne? We need champagne
Now look as hard as you can with this blunt in your hand
And now hold up your chain, slow-motion through the flames
Now cue the smoke machines and the simulated rain
But not too loud cause the baby's sleeping
I wonder if it knows what the world is keeping
Up both sleeves while he lay there dreaming
Me and my robot tip-toe 'round, creeping
I had to turn my back on what got you paid
I couldn't see, had the hood on me like Abu Ghraib
But I'd like to thank the streets that drove me crazy
And all the televisions out there that raised me
I was

(Dream, dream)
(Dream, dream)
(Dream, dream)

[Verse 1]
Soarin', is this allowed?
I sure bet my daddy proud
A little nigga with a Shaker smile
On top of the dreams is where I'm found
Some figured I was Satan bound
Until I came back with a style I found
Then all of a sudden they fixed their faces
'Cause of who I know and the trail of places
That I've stepped
How many niggas wanna hate 'cause I left?
How could you blame me and my plan of attack?
'Cause I'm risking my soul intact, now I'm heard all over the map
Only rule of thumb
It don't really matter just where you from
All that really matter is where you gon' go
Maybe upstate for some
But you can’t rule out these cats for gone
Second chances given out for some
All you gotta do is take advantage
Then maybe you can get yourself a horse and carriage
Done pimpin', you can think about marriage, until then, get it
Then find yourself and let's begin
I'ma tell you how in a minute
I'ma show you how I be livin'
From a long time ago, a young nigga, he was timid
Now I'm zoned, see things so vivid
Hide my soul? Nah, homie, not even
I'ma zone out 'til I lose feeling, remember
I'ma be gone way past November
Even, stay up there, up there
Floatin', floatin', hopin'
I can find peace somewhere

[Chorus]
In my mind
It sounds like oooooooh
When I'm gone
It feels like oooooooh
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I'm feeling alright
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I forget about it all

[Verse 2]
Ballin', is this allowed?
Without feelin' like Shallow Hal
Diamonds on the Jesus piece for style
Back in Cleveland City we ride around
Greetin' my niggas with dap and pound
So if I fall, I won't hit the ground
These are the things that'll make me smile
Knowin' this blunt might burn a while
I keep myself so lifted
I am accustomed to new heights
I feel perfect though they think it's worthless
See without my flight, man
Everybody wanna be a critic
I have my life and I will live it
Shut your mouth before I fuck it
Ha, my jokes, they will love it
If I'm seen on the scene with my slim cut jeans
More than likely I am faded, man
You are not the shit if everywhere you go
Niggas ain't sitting, standing 'round hating, so
My vice is when the lights start flashin'
I'll be zonin', all alone then
And the place where my mind is goin'
Filled with songs that no one's knowin'
And the Devil in a hot pink dress
Tryna ask me for one dance
He think he slick
But my guardians protect me from his wrath
So, in my place no hate shall enter
Livin' high up there, up there
Copin', copin', floatin'
I will find peace somewhere

[Chorus]
In my mind
It sounds like oooooooh
When I'm gone
It feels like oooooooh
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I'm feeling alright
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I forget about it all

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
In my mind
It sounds like oooooooh
When I'm gone
It feels like oooooooh
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I'm feeling alright
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I forget about it all

[Intro: Matthew Santos]
Look up in the sky
Look up in the sky
Look up in the sky (sky sky)

[Chorus: Matthew Santos]
You thought I was down
You thought I was gone
Thought I wasn’t around
That I left you alone
But look up in the sky (Look up in the sky)
Just look up in the sky (Look up in the sky)
See that I’m everywhere, everywhere
Shining down on you

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Well, well, is that our little author?
Coming back, humming his hymns, a little altered
Your attention, put back on the flow like the department of water
Taking off with the dough, like Little Walter
Chess, yes, baby, I’m Jerry Lawler
Rebel with a cause, outlaw with the lawyer
Judge, jury, like a loop
Rap name Lupe, but my daddy named me warrior
This is his memorial, shoot

[Chorus: Matthew Santos]
You thought I was down
You thought I was gone
Thought I wasn’t around
That I left you alone
But look up in the sky (Look up in the sky)
Just look up in the sky (Look up in the sky)
See that I’m everywhere, everywhere
Shining down on you

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
No, I ain’t that nigga trying to get a liquor line
When I be scripting lines, want this petition signed
It says I’m sick of dyin', sick of this prison time
I really love my people, I’m sick of pimping mine
Now if we Auto-Tune that shit
We can hear the songs from that opera groomed fat bitch
Telling us not to pursue it, just to shoe it like a blacksmith
We’re trapped, and moving round in circles like it’s Chapstick
And that’s the same encircled way of thinking that we chat with
We’ll wrap this around your head
Like the bandanas Fabolous used to wrap his hats with
Rather be in FEDS instead of National Geographics
Well, I’m not having it, nawwww

[Chorus: Matthew Santos]
You thought I was down
You thought I was gone
Thought I wasn’t around
That I left you alone
But look up in the sky (Look up in the sky)
Just look up in the sky (Look up in the sky)
See that I’m everywhere, everywhere
Shining down on you

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
So, I say hello and this is for the third time
To everybody out there who ain’t never heard mine
And if you have, then you know you ain’t never heard lying
Lu don’t moo, no, cow-ards, you only heard lines
Not a facade cherisher, I’d rather have the scars
I don’t idolize America, I’m dancing with the stars
Uh-huh, all of them? Yeah, they are, too
You look up and you see us shining down on you

[Chorus: Matthew Santos]
You thought I was down
You thought I was gone
Thought I wasn’t around
That I left you alone
But look up in the sky (Look up in the sky)
Just look up in the sky (Look up in the sky)
See that I’m everywhere, everywhere
Shining down on you

[Outro: Matthew Santos]
Shining down on you
Shining down on you
Shining down on you

[Verse 1]
Uh! I bring you murder in the first
And even as we speak we getting further in this verse
With no further ado I do what I respect
Doom got me stripes like Hamburgler for my work
As Lupe the killa, killa, killa, killa
Mercy, he's a mess, so immersed in his murk
He's 2/3 submerged below the surface where they surf
This is where I lay it down like a bird giving birth
So call me "Lu the Giant's Goose" or just "Faberge paint"
Til I'm called back to the shore by the watchers of the bay
I wait, til I come back like a tsunami
Never microwave like the watchers of the weight
I'm wrapped in aluminum foil, I do my dirt like Kwame
Until that same soil being pushed into my grave
But I'm so ahead of my time, the next day
Might strike oil where I been layed, homie I'm so crude
Texas tea, haters is so screwed
But I can't fill it like a flathead in a Philips
Don't get it twisted, nigga, I'm no tool
More cool than a pool in a blizzard
With ice cubes in it during Christmas
Meanin' there's no schoolin' the misfit
Like I'm throwin' a fit
Or I just can't fit it, tidbit too big
It's gotta hem it til it's fresh to death
Dressed to kill it, like uh!

[Verse 2]
Uh, 187 on my second, I reckon
This is an assault with a deadly session
A soft peace and blessings to the sentence that be reppin
All across in every direction, locality, and section
That know Lupe the killa, killa, killa, killa
Give it how I live it most niggas won't believe
Or achieve how I did it most niggas won't receive
'Til I leave and I bereave the secrets of my sickness
How I, flooded the streets like Venice
I've suffered, demanded, withstanded, pimp handed and hustlin'
I'm Colonel Mustard with the speech
They ain't catchin' me, no suspicions of stickin'
No convictions on my rap sheet
I'm so committing lay my murder game,that's sweet
Speakeasy like Prohibition, no admission
If you ain't knocking like me to the underground bar, burying a toast
Dodging the raid like roach, nigga please

[Verse 3]
Uh, I make it give up the ghost
On the trifecta, the third, I differ
Nigga, you ain't heard, my lecture like Lecter
Letchya in on a secret, but you can't leak it
Lupe's the killa, killa, killa, killa
Since my entrance, my niggas had packs
They moved em to a trap like Winston
Far from bustas, baby nah
All my homies henchmen
I was the rhymer, my talk went through the walls like Slimer
Or like, eating vagina
Or, a stray bullet, whichever ways I put it
Crooks was hooked like crooks through neighborhoods I pushed it
Little Caesar niggas pizzas was like "book it"
Delivery mean like Leroy Green
They couldn't take it to the places I took it
Beware, you don't look it
You ain't dressed for this affair
I'm hooded in the bushes like uh

[Produced by Bass Brothers]

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Who came through with two Glocks to terrorize your borough? (Huh?)
Told you how to slap dips and murder your girl? (I did)
Gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl
Sold a billion tapes, and still screamed "Fuck the world"
(I'm Slim Shady) So come and kill me while my name's hot
And shoot me 25 times in the same spot (Ow)
I think I got a generation brainwashed
To pop pills and smoke pot 'til they brains rot
Stop they blood flow 'til they veins clot
I need a pain shot and a shot of plain Scotch
Purple haze and acid raindrops
Spike the punch at the party and drink pop
Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top
Bad Boy, I told you that I can't stop
You gotta make 'em fear you 'fore you make 'em feel you
So everybody buy my shit or I'ma come and kill you

[Chorus]
I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend when you need a Mini Thin
(I'm Slim Shady, Shady, Shady, Shady) I'm Shady

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I like happy things, I'm really calm and peaceful (Uh-huh)
I like birds, bees, I like people
I like funny things that make me happy and gleeful
Like when my teacher sucked my wee-wee in preschool
The ill type, I stab myself with a steel spike
While I blow my brain out just to see what it feels like
'Cause this is how I am in real life (Mhm)
I don't want to just die a normal death
I wanna be killed twice (Uh-huh)
I just wanna scare somebody with a gun threat
When they high off of drugs they haven't even done yet
So bring the money by tonight
'Cause your wife said this the biggest knife
She ever saw in her life (Help me, help me)
I try to keep it positive and play it cool
Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school
(Stay in school)
Cause I'm the one they can relate to and look up to better
Tonight I think I'll write my biggest fan a fuck-you letter

[Chorus]
I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend when you need a Mini Thin
(I'm Slim Shady, Shady, Shady, Shady) I'm Shady

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Yo, I'll listen to your demo tape and act like I don't like it
(Ahh, that shit is wack)
Six months later, you'll hear your lyrics on my shit
(That's my shit)
People don't buy shit no more, they just dub it
That's why I'm still broke and had the number-one club hit
(Yup, uh-huh)
But they love it when you make your business public
So fuck it, I've got herpes while we on the subject (Uh-huh)
And if I told you I had AIDS, y'all would play it
'Cause you stupid mothafuckas think I'm playin' when I say it
Well, I do take pills, don't do speed
Don't do crack, don't do coke, I do smoke weed (Uh-huh)
Don't do smack, I do do shrooms, do drink beer (Yup)
I just wanna make a few things clear
My baby mama's not dead, she's still alive and bitching
And I don't have herpes, my dick's just itchin'
It's not syphilis, and as for being AIDS-infested
I don't know yet, I'm too scared to get tested

[Chorus]
I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some good weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend when you need a Mini Thin
(I'm Slim Shady, Shady, Shady, Shady) I'm Shady

[Outro]
I told you I was Shady (Yup)
Y'all didn't wanna believe me (Mm-mm, mm-mm)
I'm Shady
And that's my name

[Intro]
*yaaaawn*
Thank you
Feels good waking up! Get back...
On my J-O...
*yaaaawn*
I'll be going...
Plus, I gotta go to work
It's cool!

[Verse 1]
I wipe the cool from my eye
Stationed in Antarctica; coldest nigga alive
Flow is Armageddon, might smite crows from the sky
Before you drive you have to wipe locusts off your rides
But I'm warming up, oceans is on the rise
I be Ocean with 11 associates on my side
Colder than Chris Martin guitaring
Would you look at all these spies
But they can’t see me, I took out their eyes
Replace with some he’s, so all they see is eh’s
But I will never run, not even if they cry
See I can never fall, not even down their cheek
But I will always bawl, let’s see who the first to blink
And I don't need no passwords cause I don't need to cheat
But you can say your last words, and you can rest in peace
I’m the hook after your last verse I’m also like the beat
But I will turn it down so you can go to sleep

[Chorus]
So you can go to sleep, yes you can go to sleep
Said you can go to sleep, said you can go to sleep
Good night, good night, good night, good night
Real niggas up again, phony niggas tucking in
Now you can go to sleep, yes you can got to sleep
Now you can got to sleep, now you can go to sleep
Good night, good night, good night, good night
Official niggas on they job and you know we gonna ball
Real niggas popping off, phony nigga nodding off

[Verse 2]
Insomniac since way back, see this is what I been like
Baking eggs and pancakes, eating that at midnight
Getting up and going hard, I don’t need no Enzyte
Come across as very calm: mental state is Zen-like
Always had a lot of heart, never been the tin type
Never will I drop a dime, never been the 10 type
My girlfriend is very fine, yes she is a ten right
Mink is draggin’ on the flo', fire in my windpipe
You should come and clean up after the riots that I incite
Things get off the handle, left behind a landfill
Traffic at a standstill, stadium is fan-filled
Fill this bitch up with fans you still won’t blow my candle out
My "can do" spirit's in the house
And is possessing your possessions, did you hear it by the couch?
Boogieman under your bed, not in your closet
Cause I'm not a homo, won't drill no door hole
I won’t make a peep, so you can go to sleep

[Chorus]
So you can go to sleep, yes you can go to sleep
Said you can go to sleep, said you can go to sleep
Good night, good night, good night, good night
Real niggas up again, phony niggas tucking in
Now you can go to sleep, yes you can got to sleep
Now you can got to sleep, now you can go to sleep
Good night, good night, good night, good night
Official niggas on they job and you know we gonna ball
Real niggas popping off, phony nigga nodding off

[Verse 3]
I wipe the cold from my eye
Then put it in my stove and hope that my dough rise
And then my clothes dry, but I am so high
I am sitting on the storm that I got soaked by
Now you can come closer, you can get warm but you get no pie
But you can sell it for em so here’s you bow tie
Now get ready to fall cause humans don’t fly
The boy in the balloon - see? I didn’t go hide
And I'm coming back to float again
Close down all the opium but I had to O-P-EN
They said they need a hero in it so I'm back to dope again
Pull up in that old-school Flintstone drop on rolling pins
Time is all behind me, this make me feel old again
Grandma's all around me, I can feel her soul within
Hope my daddy over him; woke the roosters, woke the hens
Everything's cashmere, count the sheep that you…

[Chorus]
So you can go to sleep, yes you can go to sleep
Said you can go to sleep, said you can go to sleep
Good night, good night, good night, good night
Real niggas up again, phony niggas tucking in
Now you can go to sleep, yes you can got to sleep
Now you can got to sleep, now you can go to sleep
Good night, good night, good night, good night
Official niggas on they job and you know we gonna ball
Real niggas popping off, phony nigga nodding off

If talk is cheap, then my silence is diamonds. Preach

F...N...F

[Chorus: UNKLE]
Hello darkness, hello sunshine
Hello not at all, hello all the time
Hello nowhere, hello oblivion
Hello goodbye...
Hello darkness, hello sunshine
Hello not at all, hello all the time
Hello nowhere, hello oblivion
Hello goodbye
Hello darkness
You, you, you, you, you, you

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
All in together, the weather is better than ever
I hope it never ends, I hope it lasts forever
But when it does, we can all pretend that it's
Better than it's ever been
Lie to ourselves
Like the skies, we'll rebel
And it's well, and it's fine
And it's fine if they fell
And you can refine the storyline if you survive to retell
We all targets
Hello darkness

[Chorus: UNKLE]
Hello darkness, hello sunshine
Hello not at all, hello all the time
Hello nowhere, hello oblivion
Hello goodbye...

[Interlude: Lupe Fiasco]
They said everything's gonna be fi-fi-fine
Said everything's gonna be o-o-okay, just don't breathe the air

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
He just sits, and waits for them to kick in the door
He once was a hero, they don't love him no more
There's a blast, every time a ten hit's the floor
His gift, for not fighting another man's war
And if they can get their hands on the mask
That he had wore on his face
They can put somebody else in his place, to restore
The state, the illusion that it's safe
The faith, that being a slave is so great
As gas fills the room
And rockets destroy everything around him
He stands to find himself surrounded
By thousands of soldiers that he once trained
To never miss their targets, heartless

[Chorus: UNKLE]
Hello darkness, hello sunshine
Hello not at all, hello all the time
Hello nowhere, hello oblivion
Hello goodbye...
Hello darkness

[Bridge: UNKLE]
Pleased to make your acquaintance, salutations
Konnichiwa, hello end of the world, how are you, I'm fine

[Chorus: UNKLE]
Hello darkness, hello sunshine
Hello not at all, hello all the time
Hello nowhere, hello oblivion
Hello goodbye...
Hello darkness, hello sunshine
Hello not at all, hello all the time
Hello nowhere, hello oblivion
Hello goodbye...
Hello darkness, hello sunshine
Hello not at all, hello all the time
Hello nowhere, hello oblivion
Hello goodbye...
Hello darkness

[Instrumental Breakdown]

[Outro: UNKLE]
Hello darkness, hello sunshine
Definitely uncool

[Intro]
Yeah, What up, Chi-Town, New York City
Philly, Atlanta, Virginia
They said it was coming back around man
Back to the lyrics man
Come back to people like me, I say...

[Verse 1]
It's mean, soldiers
Now let me put the streets down like steamrollers
With the CATS that push
40 oz. through the hood like King Cobras
See we sling soda
Cause the extra four in the split is mixed
It's really thirty-six
Used to buy toasters and clips
You can tighten your circle or boa constrict
While you was lighting your purple, I was over the scripts
See, I could walk the walk, couldn't really talk the talk
Had to get my talk to properly explain my walk
Cause this lack in talk had my walk looking off
Now I'm over the limp
Watch how they mugs drop when they see my Verbal's able
That's the Usual
When I was po' I was low
Now me and my Chaps cop Purple Label
It's Ralph Lauren on the rap laureate
Niggas brown nose, they are like Alf to him
Runners at Interscope are not as Stoute as him
Please don't Interscope
It's gonna be a whole lot of Iovine and respirating
If I lean out this window with Irene
Niggas as tall as Yao Ming
With L-U-P-Emperor
Is the foundation's, I-beams and the antennas
It's so serious every time I write my John Hancock like
Could damn near see Detroit, I see you
Niggas is scared of heights
This is Saran Wrap and aluminum foil
Some potpourri, a little machine oil
I stack my paper and throw off my scents
This is top floor, better look out below
Pennies from heaven is the same as a semi from the second
And I reign supreme
Turn your umbrellas upside down
Did you even catch the change in theme
This is gangsta man

[Chorus]
Lupe to the F-to-the-I
To-the-A-to-the-S-to-the-C-to-the-O
From the west side of the C-to-the-H
To-the-I-C-A-to-the-G-to-the-O (That's ganster, man)

[Verse 2]
And them niggas ain't Was nor from his regime
Gangsta lean
Hats on tilt like these Snickers ain't drop out the vending machine
You gotta put more money in
And I shake niggas up every time I drop a bar
(2 for 1)
It's horse in the Porsche and bricks in the box
Like mo' money them every time I cop a car
You see I'm a roller, right
So it might be a Rover, right
But every time I drop an 'r'
Get off the streets
It's "over," 'ight
Bet I be in the head like overnight
Like rollers, right
She the chauffeur, right
So I keep her sober
She don't get Fed Ex like overnight
I am Dolemite
All that gas can't help you but solar might
Just call on sun
Drop a 's'
Pick up an 'o'
Uno, put it all on "one"
Brace yourself like overbite
"For that quiet nigga that relocated down south
Coming back to floss"
Nigga get your molars right
Fix your grill
No plaque but a whole lot of cheese
This the drill
Mr. Chill gave me the green light like Yoda knife
So I'mma force my will
Like the Force I wield
Of course you will
Take my time
But weight behind only pertains
To that Porsche grill
It's snakes in the hood
Gotta watch for that Cobra bite
Let me see
There's snakes in the hood
A bird, a horse behind the grill
Something gator on the seat
And a fox behind the wheel
No it's not Noah's Ark, Ahk
It's just a flower's start, this is

[Chorus]
Lupe to the F-to-the-I
To-the-A-to-the-S-to-the-C-to-the-O
From the west side of the C-to-the-H
To-the-I-C-A-to-the-G-to-the-O (That's ganster, man)

[Verse 3]
—verachiever (Yeah)
My procedure's
To proceed at all cost with no breather
I'm all walk, rain, snow, or fever
I'm all coughs coming after your teacher
I'm on the ball like FIFA, Viva
Lupe Duce, long live the leader
I remember I ain't have sneakers
It was welfare
Coming up for Airs like
Whales there
Fila, but now I'm well here
I'm Shamu with twelve pair
And niggas wanna take me back to zero like tare fare
Well, my skill's clear
You Sea World
It's Braille here
I'm Bumpy Johnson I stick to the streets
Keep my dogs out in front of me
You see what I'm saying
And I push ki's wonderfully
This is gangsta, man

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
When the pimp's in the crib, ma (Drop it like it's hot
Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot)
When the pigs try to get at you (Park it like it's hot
Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot)
And if a nigga get a attitude (Pop it like it's hot
Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot)
I got the Rollie on my arm, and I'm pourin' Chandon
And I roll the best weed 'cause I got it goin' on

[Verse 1: Pharrell]
I'm a nice dude (Uh), with some nice dreams (Yep)
See these ice cubes? (Uh) See these Ice Creams?
Eligible bachelor, million dollar boat
That's whiter than what's spillin' down your throat
The Phantom, exterior like fish eggs
The interior like suicide-wrist red
I can exercise you, this can be your Phys. Ed
Cheat on your man, ma, that's how you get ahizzead
Killer with the beat, I know killers in the street
With the steel that'll make you feel like Chinchilla in the heat
So don't try to run up on my ear talkin' all that
Raspy shit, tryin' to ask me shit
When my niggas fill your vest, they ain't gon' pass me shit
You should think about it—take a second *Ding*
Matter-fact, you should take four, B
And think before you fuck with lil' Skateboard P

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
When the pimp's in the crib, ma (Drop it like it's hot

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I'm a gangsta, but y'all knew that
Da Big Boss Dogg, yeah, I had to do that
I keep a blue flag hangin' out my backside
But only on the left side—yeah, that's the Crip side
Ain't no other way to play the game the way I play
I cut so much, you thought I was a DJ *rewind*
"Two, re-pe-re-pe one, yep, three!"
S-N double O-P, D-O double G
I can't fake it, just break it, and when I take it
See, I specialize in makin' all the girls get naked
So bring your friends, all of y'all come inside
We got a world premiere right here, now get live! (So don't)
So don't change the dizzle, turn it up a little
I got a livin' room full of fine dime brizzles
Waitin' on the Pizzle, the Dizzle, and the Chizzle
G's to the bizzack—now, ladies, here we gizzo!

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
When the pimp's in the crib, ma (Drop it like it's hot
Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot)
When the pigs try to get at you (Park it like it's hot

I got the Rolly on my arm, and I'm pourin' Chandon
And I roll the best weed 'cause I got it goin' on

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
I'm a bad boy, with a lot of hoes
Drive my own cars, and wear my own clothes
I hang out tough, I'm a real boss
Big Snoop Dogg, yeah he's so sharp
On the TV screen, and in the magazines
If you play me close, you're on a red beam
Oh you got a gun, so you wanna pop back?
AK-47 now, nigga, stop that!
Cement shoes, now I'm on the move
Your family's cryin', now you on the news
They can't find you, and now they miss you
Must I remind you, I'm only here to twist you
Pistol-whip you, dip you, then flip you
Then dance to this mothafuckin' music we Crip to
Subscribe, nigga, get your issue
Baby, come close, let me see how you get loose!

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
When the pimp's in the crib, ma (Drop it like it's hot
Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot)
When the pigs try to get at you (Park it like it's hot
Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot)
And if a nigga get a attitude (Pop it like it's hot
Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot)
I got the Rolly on my arm, and I'm pourin' Chandon
And I roll the best weed 'cause I got it goin' on

Snooooooooooop
Snooooooooooop

[Verse 1 - Beanie Sigel]
You can't tell me nothing
Gangster? I don't buy it -- you can't sell me nothing
I'm everything you thought I wasn't
Now check out how I does it on this K. West production
All your bullshit, I will flush it
And I got the paper to wipe that ass
Every little song and dance come out, y'all hype that trash
And yo, I'm far from a hater
Cause suckers gotta eat too -- get y'all paper
I ain't mad at cha -- I just can't deal with these fake rappers
Cause most of these niggas wear they boxers backwards
Niggas claim king but can't govern they household
Now real niggas doing time from shit they mouth told
Why dick-eating niggas always rap with a mouth full?
But you know they don't play with me
The realest nigga alive -- what can these niggas say to me? Nothing

[Hook - Kanye West]
La la la la, wait 'til I get my money right
La la la la, then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, is you saying something?
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing

[Verse 2 - Freeway]
I had a dream that Jay and Dame was back together
And in that second, everything was back the same
In reality, your boy went to Mecca, came back
And said that I would never rap again
But I'm back and that's the way the ball bounce
A verse is a ounce, a album's a brick -- now it's time for traffic game
Y'all lame, I am the product
Hotter than lava, they wonder how this Roc-a-fella package came
First you take a brick of Jay, a brick of 'Ye
Couple quarters of Freeway, an ounce of Beans
Then you kill 'em with the flow
We the realest; even Dontrelle Willis couldn't out the team
We speak the truth and they believe us
Tell FEMA even Hurricane Katrina couldn't out the flames
Roc-a-fella here to stay, we airing out y'all lames
Free At Last on the way, so clear 'em out my lane

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Kanye West]
Yeah homie, this the theme song
First I get my money right, then I get my team on
If I always prayed to have gleam on
Three hundred dollar jeans on, do that mean I dream wrong?
And I was high as a Lear jet
Fly as the insect even though we in debt
And it don't matter if I get her number cause
When I get my money right, she gon' come running
And I be good like God with a extra "o"
God knows that my check needs some extra O's
And you know that you need to bring some extra
Not in jogging pants, either -- tell 'em wear some sexy clothes
Now my game so professional and my chain so fresh, they go
But after the fame, did you gain anything?
Damn, 'Ye, would you change anything?
Well, 

[Young Jeezy: If I had a billion dollars]
I'd cop more pink Polos and pop those collars
Misery love company, her nickname "Sorrow"
My Benz need company, her nickname Tahoe
"Wait 'til I get my money" everybody motto
So I'mma need a bravo for everything that I wrote
Yeah -- hey mama, they can't hate 'em
Cause after all of the drama, K slayed 'em

[Hook]

[Verse 4 - Uncle Murda]
Listen -- I ain't worried 'bout shit
It's a Roc-a-fella/GMG invasion, bitch
You hear them niggas talking 'bout me? Ain't that some shit
These niggas is like bitches -- they all on my dick
They don't want no real G to get in position
I opened up the door so all my real niggas could get in
Roc-a-fella, Def Jam, GMG it's on
Uncle Murda coming for the motherfucking throne
Listen, you could call me the king of New York
You can't front, I'm doing my thing
If it wasn't for the chronic and these bad-ass ho's
I'd be shooting motherfuckers everywhere I go, oh
But the head I be getting got me chilling
Got a nigga like, let me focus on these millions, man
It got me not thinking 'bout these lames
They don't really want no beef, they ain't life-threatening
I'm puffing purple haze with that sour diesel
Can't forget that kush -- I'm high as a eagle
And just cause I'm high off that marijuana
Don't mean I don't see them niggas creeping around the corner
They goners

[Chorus]
(Hey Mama)
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey Mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me
(Hey Mama)

[Verse 1]
I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine and I'm finna let it shine
I'm finna take y'all back to them better times
I'm finna talk about my mama if y'all don't mind
I was three years old when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that, mommy, can't you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
'Cause a nigga cheatin', telling you lies, then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy I'ma love you 'til you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more
And I'ma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford
See you're unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable, lady that's makin' loot
A livin' legend too, just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel, and I thank you (Hey Mama)

[Chorus]
(Hey Mama)
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey Mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me
(Hey Mama)

[Verse 2]
Forrest Gump mama said, "Life is like a box of chocolates"
My mama told me go to school, get your doctorate
Somethin to fall back on, you could profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like it's things I gotta get
Things I gotta do, just to prove to you
You was getting through, can the choir, please
Give me a verse of "You Are So Beautiful To Me"
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou, Nikki Giovanni, turn one page and there's my mommy
Come on Mommy just dance wit' me, let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say Hey, y'all say, Mama, now everybody answer me (Hey Mama)

[Chorus]
(Hey Mama)
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey Mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin' back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me
(Hey Mama)

[Verse 3]
I guess it also depends though if my ends low
Second, they get up you gon' get that Benzo
Tint the windows, ride around the city and let ya friends know (Hey Mama)
Tell your job you gotta fake 'em out
Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out
To a restaurant, upper echelon
I'ma get you a Jag, whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like?
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It don't gotta be Mother's Day, or your birthday
For me to just call and say: (Hey Mama)

[Chorus]
I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do
(Hey Mama)
You know I love you so
I never let you go
Wrote this song just so you know
No matter where you go our love is true
Mama mama mama mama mama
Mama mama mama mama mama

[Produced by Jon Brion & Kanye West]

[Verse 1]
Your attention, please! Your attention, I need it
So I can sit you in a position from which I see it
Where I'm seated is scenic
Heavy-weighter, slim as the Machinist, so bulimic
Which means you somewhere in between it
I take it back for you like the Wyld Stallyns of San Dimas
I'm in the market for low-mile 360 Modenas
And a good organic cleaners
My car always a winner
Your car's always pitted, we should call it Stanley Steamers
Most of my friends in gangs
My new nickname is Genghis Khan
But without the 'Ye, but his last name's my side
I ride with the meanest, I'm armed to the teeth
You're Venus and you've never been to the dentist
School of Hard Knocks, I dean it
I done it, as well as a celebrated alumnus
I donate to the campus and my name's on the arenas
But you can't bring it to my court not even with subpoenas
Cause you can't play my sport but you can still cheerlead us
And you can't sit there, that section's for the seniors
And the sexy señoritas, so just move up to the bleachers
How you going to school me when I grew up with your teachers
I know that you can't hear me 'cause I blew up all the speakers
And the power line is hanging 'cause I threw up all the sneakers
I ate up the im-pastas and I chewed through all the pizzas
I blacked out with a black card and I maxed out all the Visas
Accreditation so prestigious, just walk across my stage
Your life will be completed
Don't need financial aid, 'cause this is just some free shit
You been properly prepared, throw your hats up in the air
I'm red hot, Chilly, I'm Anthony Kiedis
My spirit smells teenage, and Chi-Town's feeling excellent
We hit them with the President, see, we set the precedent
I don't feel I'm best, I just feel I'm better than...

[Chorus: Sample]
"Everyone
Everyone around here
Everyone is so near
It's holding on
It's holding on"

[Verse 2]
See I don't disagree, this is just a grievance
This ain't dissing, this is civil disobedience
How you going to make hip-hop without all the ingredients?
Lot of mouths to feed, plus a lot of greediness
And that greed, outshines the neediness
What niggas need is some question they authority
And tune out all the TV shit
And we be this
So I give them more, you see, I did it for...

[Chorus: Sample]
Everyone
Everyone is so near
Everyone has got the fear
It's holding on
It's holding on

[Verse 3]
Yeah, I am back up on the airwaves
Feeling like a Soldier and I ain't talking where the Bears play
Flair, look how I Fred Astaire down the staircases
It's finna be a hair-raising tortoise versus hare race
So you should hang around here like some earrings
I know attention's all about how you pair things
So when I want them to hear me out
I just sit them next to some pictures of Rosa splitting with her titties out
And what's written on her titties is what it's really about
Then her vagina is some poor kids from China
Nipples, nuclear missiles
Ass is a daughter without a dad, back is like Afghanistan, Iraq
Health care hair, drive-by thighs, education lips, HIV eyes
Environment feet, justice get her so wet
Brains get you brains, you can fuck her if you protest
But before you bust in her face
Finish listening to the tape; Enemy of the State

[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
(Enemy of the State)
Aww, yeah

[Verse: Lupe Fiasco]
This one's for Chilly Chill, Food and Liquor flow
Strong like it's been distilled by
Hillbillies in the hills and we move down to Beverly
So heavenly, waking niggas up like Reveille
We won't be going back to you regularly, so forget it
Shadow flow, colder than Punxsutawney Phillip
My mind's on dope, my brain's on skillets
Thoroughly trained to just bang off lyrics
Bang bang bang like Pops Wayans
Witherspoon or with a fork, was coming out my egg like Mork
Deserves his own head on Rushmore
Flood the game like a giant in a dwarf's shorts
So long niggas, career so short
It should be riding on a horse, mines is a horse
But mines is the size you could sneak inside a fort
Yours is a pony, it could sleep inside a Porsche
I am on point like the eating side of forks
So keep your head down like your reflection in a spoon
Chilly Chill will be out of corrections real soon

[Outro]
Enemy!
God willingly (Enemy of the State)
Aw
You don't get it
I'm just a wolf inside a lion's suit
A shark shirt, a panther's pants, piranha hat and tiger shoes
I got a lion's den inside the booth
That right there is point blank
This here is from where the sniper shoot
Might take a long time to get it, by the time I hit it
I done ran Bubble Tape around them Chiclets, poof
I ain't the bomb, I'm the company that got the contract
To rebuild during the aftermath - have a blast
Going green only using half the gas
The calming comes through after disasters have
But this calm has the same fury that disasters have
I should have a class, I'm the son/sun of the South Pole plus Alaska's dad
Got niggas like "DAG!!", flow is like crazy gone mad
And villains gone bad, Punk ass niggas, don't be so Daft
Baby, why you hanging with them Busters like Babs?
They are such a drag, you should move them to the trash
Feel like I'm walking round upon Cassius calves
Quite a beautiful script, and such a gift of gab
A big Bay shout out to Mistah F.A.B
Young Frankenstein reporting live from the lab
I bought the bars out, put it on my tab
If you came here to box, you'll leave in a bag
I run the game, Bilderberg Group, in the lead with the flash
Usain Bolt ain't even leaving this fast
Why you take offense with your defensive ass?
Never Hussein in the (w)hole, not even in the half
Cause nigga I ain't hiding, I'm the whole world, nigga you're an island
And the seas rising, if I keep shining
You going have to take submarines to the drive-in now
Great
Enemy of the State
Go, go, go, go
The game was looking weak, the whole scene starved
So I came through with some Muscle Milk and protein bars
Barbells and jump ropes, Bowflexes to body it
And a couple Billy Blanks Tae-Bo Karate kicks
If you ain't Million Dollar Dreaming then we opposites
In high school I was voted the most Ted DiBiase-est
Also the most slept on, cause my Ted DiBiase-ness
An Inglorious Basterd and you looking like a Nazi, bitch
They say it's hard out here for old boy, then tell me where Taraji is
I am going so raw watch me Soy Sauce, Wasabi this
Nobu/noble on them Pro-Tools, hot as H-E- double hockey sticks
Make sure you give the chef your compliments
And thank him for his constantly great tasting accomplishments
A smiley face, emoticons if you want to remain anonymous
My retirement's on hold, I got the whole world on conference
Matchstick Man, I really have the confidence
That I'm a give them G.O.O.D Music like Common Sense and Consequence
Content that's relative across the continent
New York, Houston, Chi-Town, Los Angeles
Enemy
(ENEMY OF THE STATE)

[Verse 1]
When I get to the bottom, I go back to the top of the slide
Where I stop, and I turn, and I go for a ride
'Til I get to the bottom, and I see you again
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

[Bridge]
Well, do you, don't you want me to love you?
I'm coming down fast, but I'm miles above you
Tell me, tell me, tell me, come on, tell me the answer
Well, you may be a lover, but you ain't no dancer

[Chorus]
Now, Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Yeah
Woo

[Bridge]
Oh, will you, won't you want me to make you?
I'm coming down fast, but don't let me break you
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
You may be a lover, but you ain't no dancer

[Chorus]
Look out
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Ooh
Look out
'Cause here she comes

[Verse 2]
When I get to the bottom, I go back to the top of the slide
And I stop, and I turn, and I go for a ride
And I get to the bottom, and I see you again
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Well, do you, don't you want me to make you?
I'm coming down fast, but don't let me break you
Tell me, tell me, tell me your answer
You may be a lover, but you ain't no dancer

[Chorus]
Look out
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Helter skelter

[Outro]
Well look out, helter skelter
She's coming down fast
Yes, she is
Yes, she is
Coming down fast
Oh, yeah, Helter Skelter
Woo

[Breakdown]

[Spoken: Ringo Starr]
I got blisters on my fingers

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Affirmative no further furnishing is needed
I believe we are completed, dig
We all in agreement on the wallpaper
Happy with the color scheme, welcome to the crib
A two family Habitat For Humanity
With a view of where the insanity live
My vida loca was built like Bob Vila via God
He architected, I arted what I harbored, Jimmy Carter
From Chicago's west side, finish my construction now
We hold the coming like contracepts
I'm conscious, 'cept the cons I kept
With conversations held with the Satan on my shoulder
Which lead to steps that kept me looking over the shoulder
Like chauffeurs, where my angels at
Painful yet Mary I ain't Jerry Garcia, ma
Here but I'm grateful, chuuch!

[Hook: Gemini]
We just might be OK, after all
Sun gone shine, on this day

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
It's finna get heavy as heaven
I am Atlas at this manage to balance
Massive masses pull my back with out tilting my glasses
This was not pilfered from passages of OG's, this is so me
Ask us many mention little homie, little bony
But the rhymes is fat, in fact
Just like a Rochester customer
God bless the mothers and younger brothers of hustlers
Cause she don't wan' sob at his wake
But he want to follow in his steps
Bang his hat, learn his shakes
Master his swagger in the bathroom mirror
Cop a Chevy, steady mob in his place
Chyeah! it's just the problems we face
Look his moms in her face and promise he's straight

[Hook: Gemini]
We just might be OK, after all
Sun gone shine, on this day

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Then he leaves the house that love built that
HUD renovated that section 8 pays for
Well let's pray for em, let the beat play for em
Put his struggles on display for em
Cause he gotta go and face the drama
With a different face from the one that he use
To face his momma, if you look close you'll see
It consist of a smile that hurts, an ice grill, and a trace of trauma
Little bit of his father, another criterion
That's no different from a young Liberian
Who let the delirium weary him, living in the inner city
Out of his mind, liria reconcilia
I'm cool, I don't foretell best
I ain't nicest MC, I ain't Cornel West
I am Cornel Westside, Chi-town Guevara
Malcolm eXorcise the demons, gangsta leaning
He traded in his kufi for a New Era
Chose a 44 over a mortarboard
I ain't a credited institute graduate, I ain't from Nazareth
My conception wasn't immaculate, I ain't master no calculus
A good addition to the rap audience
I back flipped on the mattress they slept on me on
Whaddown Joe, knowing is half the battle
Fighting temptation, have an apple
Shakes the snakes, pimp the system
Let's get into it, tabernacle

[Hook: Gemini]
We just might be OK, after all
Sun gone shine, on this day

[Produced By: Soundtrakk]

[Intro]
Ugh! (Woo!)
What up, y'all? Yeah
(Soundtrakk, what's poppin', baby?)
Woo! (Ugh)
If y'all ain't know
I go by the name of Lupe Fiasco
(Kick, push, coast)
Representing that First and Fifteenth, yeah, uh
And this one right here
I dedicate this one right here (Uproxx...)
To all my homies out there grinding
You know what I'm saying? Legally and illegally, haha
You know what I'm talking about? (Woo!)
So, check it out, uh

[Verse 1]
First got it when he was six, didn't know any tricks
Matter of fact, first time he got on it, he slipped
Landed on his hip and busted his lip
For a week he had to talk with a lisp, like thisss... (Ugh)
Now we can end the story right here
But shorty didn't quit, it was something in the air (Ugh)
Yeah, he said it was something so appealing
He couldn't fight the feeling, something about it
He knew he couldn't doubt it, couldn't understand it
Branded, since the first kickflip he landed, ugh (Woo)
Labeled a misfit, a bandit
Ka-kunk, ka-kunk, ka-kunk; his neighbors couldn't stand it
So, he was banished to the park
Started in the morning, wouldn't stop 'til after dark, yeah
When they said "It's getting late in here
So I'm sorry, young man, there's no skating here"

[Hook]
And so he kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
And away he rolled
Just a rebel to the world with no place to go
And so he kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be

[Bridge]
So let's kick... (Ugh)
And push (Y-yeah, y-yeah-yeah)
And coast
Uh, uh, uh (Y-yeah, y-yeah-yeah)

[Verse 2]
My man got a little older, became a better roller
Yeah, no helmet, hell bent on killing himself
Is what his mama said, but he was feeling himself
Got a little more swagger in his style
Met his girlfriend, she was clapping in the crowd
Love is what-what was happening to him now, ugh!
He said "I would marry you
But I'm engaged to these aerials and varials
And I don't think this board is strong enough to carry two"
She said "Bow! I weigh a hundred and twenty pounds" (Woo!)
"Now, let me make one thing clear
I don't need to ride yours, I got mine right here"
So she took him to a spot he didn't know about
Some odd-end apartment parking lot
She said "I don't normally take dates in here"
Security came and said "I'm sorry, there's no skating here"

[Hook]
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
And away they roll
Just lovers intertwined with no place to go
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
So come and skate with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be

[Bridge]
So let's kick (Ugh, ugh)
And push, yeah, yeah (Woo, woo)
And coast... (Yeah, ugh!)
(Haha, swanky)
Yeah, yeah!

[Verse 3]
Before he knew, he had a crew that wasn't no punk
In they Spitfire shirts and SB dunks
They would push 'til they couldn't skate no more
Office building lobbies wasn't safe no more
And it wasn't like they wasn't getting chased no more
Just the freedom was better than breathing, they said (They said...)
An escape route they used to escape out
When things got crazy, they needed to break out
They'd head... to any place with stairs
Any good grinds, the world was theirs, ugh!
And their four wheels would take them there
Until the cops came and said, "There's no skating here"

[Hook]
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
And away they rolled
Just rebels without a cause with no place to go
And so they kick, push, kick, push
Kick, push, kick, push; coast...
So come roll with me
Just a rebel looking for a place to be

[Bridge]
So let's kick (Ugh, ugh)
And push, yeah, yeah (Woo, woo)
And coast...
Ah-ha, swanky (Mm, mm)

[Produced by: The Neptunes]

[Intro]
Ho! Yeah (A-yessir)
Haha (A-yessir)
You know what it is, Lupe!
Chicago man, yeah (Uhh, uhh)
Hahah, man (Uhh, uhh)
You know I have you (Right, right, right, right)
You know! Uhh (Right, right, right, right)

[Verse 1]
They call me Lupe, I'll be your new day
They wanna smell like me, they want my bouquet
But they can't, they accented like the UK
Turn that eau de Lupe to Pepe Le Pew spray
Flagrantly fragrant and they can't escape it
My perfume pursued them everywhere that they went
You don't want a loan, leave my cologne alone
It's a little too strong for you to be putting on
Trust me, I say this justly
I went from musty to musky and y'all can't mush me
I warn y'all cornballs, I hush puppies
The swans in the pond call my duck ugly
But now they hug me, because it's lovely
They love the aroma of a roamer of the world
Got the shakers and the skaters and the players and the girls
Keep the fakers and the flakers and the haters in a twirl

[Hook]
You want the flava ma? Hey I gotcha
You want the realness? Well I gotcha
I know you sick of them niggas big car and watch you
Either they pimps or they macks or they mobsters
You want the real shit? Well I gotcha
You see my niggas here, you know we proper
You know we do it right (Right) right (Right)
Right (Right) right (Right)
Right (Right) right (Right) right (Right) right (You know we do it)

[Verse 2]
And I'm from Chi-Town, that's where I flies round
Keep some Cartier frames over my eyes now
We used to gangbang, a lot of that done died down
Children of the hat tiltin' keepin' hope alive now
All with no high, I do it so fly
Banksy's attack helicopter with the bow tie
I love my city, really hope that God bless it
Have my mind moving faster than that hog in the hedges
Welcome all of y'all to my dark recesses
This is where I keep the bars like bathtub edges
My Ivories and my Doves, my Levers and my Zests
This takes half of your bubble bath to match the freshness
The belly of the beast, you know I'm from it
I wrap it in a towel, hit Gomer Pyle in the stomach
And I be on my green like Irish Spring and I coast
Fudge with it, get a mouth full of soap

[Hook]
You want the flava ma? Hey I gotcha
You want the realness? Well I gotcha
I know you sick of them niggas big car and watch you
Either they pimps or they macks or they mobsters
You want the real shit? Well I gotcha
You see my niggas here, you know we proper
You know we do it right (Right) right (Right)
Right (Right) right (Right)
Right (Right) right (Right) right (Right) right (You know we do it)

[Verse 3]
And so to sign off, this beat I rhyme off
Is from Thelonious P and Hugo Mind Boss
You feel it in the air, it's such a fine force
But you don't hear me though, just like a mime's talk
That's cause I'm in Europe, me in my French tour
I'm on my pimp, my temperature is tempura
I take it easy on my watch, I'm watching TV
In my cleanest Maharashi, see the hare is tryna beat me
I continue to do Lu's pace
They say him got two heads and four eyes just like screwface
But see my secret's safe, it's in my secret safe
That's in my secret room on my secret base
So from the runner of the FNF crew
Come in hip hop, we've come to resurrect you
You, you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you

[Hook]
You want the flava ma? Hey I gotcha
You want the realness? Well I gotcha
I know you sick of them niggas big car and watch you
Either they pimps or they macks or they mobsters
You want the real shit? Well I gotcha
You see my niggas here, you know we proper
You know we do it right (Right) right (Right)
Right (Right) right (Right)
Right (Right) right (Right) right (Right) right (You know we do it)

[Outro]
Yessir
F&F U-P

[Hook: Gemini & Sarah Green]
I can't, I won't, I can't, I won't
Let you leave
I don't know what you want, you want
Want from me

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
She said to him
"I want you to be a father, he's your little boy
And you don't even bother, like
‘Brother' without the ‘R’, and he's starting to harbor
Cool on food for thought, but for you he's a starver
Starting to use red markers on his work
His teacher say they know he's much smarter
But he's hurt
Used to hand his homework in first like he was the classroom starter."
Burst to tears, let him know she's serious
"Now he's fighting in class
Got a note last week that says he might not pass
Ask me if his daddy was sick of us
Cause you ain't never pick him up
You see what his problem is?
He don't know where his poppa is
No positive male role model
To play football and build railroad models
It's making a hole; you've been digging it
Cause you ain't been kicking it
Since he was old enough to hold bottles
He wasn't supposed to get introduced to that
He don't deserve to get used to that
Now I ain't asking you for money or to come back to me
Some days it ain't sunny, but it ain't so hard
Just breaks my heart
When I try to provide and he say 'Mommy, that ain't your job'
To be a man, I try to make him understand
That I'm his number one fan
But it's like you booing from the stands
You know the world is out to get him
So why don't you give him a chance?"

[Hook: Gemini & Sarah Green]
I can't, I won't, I can't, I won't
Let you leave
I don't know what you want, you want
Want from me

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
So he said to him
"I want you to be a father, I'm your little boy
And you don't even bother, like
‘Brother' without the ‘R’, and I'm starting to harbor

But I'm hurt
I used to hand my homework in first

Burst to tears, let him know he's serious
"Now I'm fighting in class
Got a note last week that say I might not pass
Kids ask me if my daddy is sick of us
Cause you ain't never pick me up
You see what my problem is?
That I don't know where my poppa is
No positive male role model
To play football and build railroad models
It's making a hole; you've been digging it

Now I ain't asking you for money or to come back to me
Some days it ain't sunny but it ain't so hard
Just breaks my heart
When my momma try to provide and I tell her 'That ain't your job'
To be a man, she try to make me understand
That she my number one fan
But its like you booing from the stands
You know the world is out to get me
Why don't you give me a chance?"

[Hook: Gemini & Sarah Green]
I can't, I won't, I can't, I won't
Let you leave
I don't know what you want, you want
Want from me
I can't, I won't, I can't, I won't
Let you leave
I don't know what you want, you want
Want from me

[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
Close your mind
Close your eyes, see with your heart
How do you forgive the murderer of your father?
The ink of a scholar is worth a thousand times more
Than the blood of a martyr (uhh)
Terrorist (yeah, uhh)

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
We came through the storm, nooses on our necks
And a smallpox blanket to keep us warm
On a 747 on the Pentagon lawn
Wake up, the alarm clock is connected to a bomb
Anthrax lab on a West Virginia farm
Shorty ain't learned to walk, already heavily armed
Civilians and little children is especially harmed
Camoflauged Torahs, Bibles and glorious Qurans
The books that take you to heaven and let you meet the Lord there
Have become misinterpretated reasons for warfare
Reread them with blind eyes, I guarantee you there's more there
Rich must be blind cause they ain't see the poor there
Need to open up a park
Just close ten schools, we don't need 'em
Can you please call the fire department?
They're down here marching for freedom
Burn down their teepees, turn their TVs on to teach 'em
And move

[Chorus: Matthew Santos]
The more money that they make
The more money that they make, the better and better they live
Whatever they wanna take
Whatever they wanna take, whatever, whatever it is
The more that you wanna learn
The more that you try to learn, the better and better it gets
American terrorist

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Now the poor Ku Klux man see that we all brothers
Not cause things the same but cause we lack the same color
And that's green, now that's mean
Can't burn his cross cause he can't afford the gasoline
Now if a Muslim woman strapped with a bomb on a bus
With the seconds running, give you the jitters
Just imagine an American-based Christian organization
Planning to poison water supplies to bring the second coming quicker
Nigga! They ain't living properly
Break 'em off a little democracy
Turn their whole culture to a mockery
Give 'em Coca-Cola for their property
Give 'em gum, give 'em guns, get 'em young, give 'em fun
But if they ain't givin' it up, then they ain't gettin' none
And don't give 'em all, naw man, just give 'em some
It's the paper, some of these cops must be Al-Qaeda, nigga, uh

[Chorus: Matthew Santos]
The more money that they make
The more money that they make, the better and better they live
Whatever they wanna take
Whatever they wanna take, whatever, whatever it is
The more that you wanna learn
The more that you try to learn, the better and better it gets
American terrorist
The more money that they make
The more money that they make, the better and better they live
Whatever they wanna take
Whatever they wanna take, whatever, whatever it is
The more that you wanna learn
The more that you try to learn, the better and better it gets
American terrorist

[Bridge: Lupe Fiasco]
It's like
Don't give the black man food, give red man liquor
Red man fool, black man nigga
Give yellow man tool, make him railroad builder
Also give him pan, make him pull gold from river
Give black man crack, Glock and things
Give red man craps, slot machines
Now bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back
Don't give the black man food, give the red man liquor
Red man fool, black man nigga
Give yellow man tool, make him railroad builder
Also give him pan, make him pull gold from river
Give black man crack, Glocks and ting
Give the red man craps, slot machines
Now bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, uh

[Outro: Matthew Santos]
American terrorist

[Intro]
Look at what we did
Came a long way from dirty ghetto kids
Yeah, look at what we did
We came a long way from dirty ghetto kids
You know what it is, haha

[Verse 1]
Well the cops didn't fine 'em for grindin', no
They kinda blew the vibe, figured it was time to go
Plus he had to be at home a long time ago
And he had made like ten dollars off the sign he wrote
It read:
"A lil hungry, and need a lil money
It's for my lil sister and her lil tummy"
Wasn't lying tho, he didn't go buy hydro
Went to the restaurant and bought two gyros
Cause he knew they wasn't cookin' where he live
The kunk-kakunk-kakunks now took him to the crib
A lil hurt from the rail he took into the ribs
Right pass the pushers who couldn't under dig
What's the use of pushin'? You ain't pushin' none of this
If I kick it with y'all I'm just pushin' for a bid
But what was on his mind, and pushed him to the lid
Their best customer wasn't cookin' for her kids
Gets up to pump, so he

[Hook 1] (X2)
Kick, push
Over his shoulders he swore he'd never look
Cause wasn't nothing back there, but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive
Yeah, uh, and so he

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you see his mom was a crack head
And his father couldn't be contacted
He lived with being different, was combated
Amongst the other things on his young, black head
And see his girl was a white girl
But just cause she was white, see her life wasn't light world
She too had the drama thick
Had a daddy and a mama, but her daddy used to mama hit
Daddy caught something chasin' fatties, made her mama sick
Couldn't afford the medicine, pimped her to the pharmacist
Had suicidal feelings, would ride
Switch over the transition help her conquer it
Pays for mama's pills with a sponsorship
Her cell phone bill and a Honda kit
Uh huh, and that's why she skates with he
Someone to feel the pain and a place to be
That's why, that's why, that's why, she

[Hook 2] (X2)
Kick, push
Over her shoulders she swore she'd never look
Cause wasn't nothing back there, but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive
Yeah, uh, that's why she

[Verse 3]
Yeah, a traveling band of misfits and outcasts
Nod they heads from Misfits to Outkast
A lot of scars, they did this without pads
A lot of hearts who did this without dads
One's father was filthy rich
Two was middle class, and one was homeless
Add in the paralyzed girl in the wheelchair
Who just liked to watch, and that was the whole clique
I think about 'em every time I see this old flick
That was taken in the park in front of this old bench
They wrote on the back, "You thank for push, kick
Hope you make a video, the beat is so sick"
Well I did, I hope you seen it
It's on MTV, Soundtrakk's a genius
Love from Tony Hawk, beef from the Ice Creamaz
Before we put it out, had to pay the Filipinas
Just to show 'em how you

[Hook 3]
Kick, push
Over ya shoulders you swore you'd never look
Cause wasn't nothing back there, but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive

[Intro: Prolyfic]
Carrera's a predator
Collector of the best of the Ericas, Rebeccas, etcetera
Set in my way!

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
One for the money, and two for the base
Three for the bail, and four for the case
I hops out in my militant way
Fresh Puerto Rican Airs, green Michigan J
Hello my ladies, hello my honeys
Feast Your eyes 'pon feminine prey
Go (Carrera's a predator
Collector of the best of the Ericas, Rebeccas, etcetera
Set in my way, yeah)
Yes I move, I agree
I get to it, I'm more faster, lowkey
Like C-O-G, go backwards, me
I ain't trippin but you simpin'
Running around like a chicken with his head cut off
Well I be pimping, I be limping like a chicken with his leg cut off
The amputee, the man with

[Hook: Prolyfic & Lupe Fiasco]
You best, slow down
Cause you speeding
(I'm bout my money, bout my paper
Bout my money, Joe)
You best, slow down
Cause you speeding
(I'm bout my money, bout my paper
Bout my money, Joe)

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
The Fifteenth is me, the First is for Chill
12s for the toast and 20s for the wheels
Something for the cash and something for the bills
Representing for my New Jacks and all my Jills
Nice... real... tight
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, now
Back to my powers, my prowess
For moving the powders, my accolades
Don't put your alkaloids
All burned like aftershave right after fades
Boy, learn, quick
Might trip over spike strips
That's just a slight story
Inflate my white walls, reinstate the eyeball then I tip

[Hook: Prolyfic & Lupe Fiasco]
You best, slow down
Cause you speeding
(I'm bout my money, bout my paper
Bout my money, Joe)
You best, slow down
Cause you speeding
(I'm bout my money, bout my paper
Bout my money, Joe)

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Ichi for my city
And ni for my hood
San for the bad
And shi for the good
Go a dub for your addictions
Pennies for my thoughts, quarters for the flipping
Ten thousand dollars for my description
If it leads to a conviction
All that for tipping, half a mil for my depiction
And just fourteen-ninety nine to listen
Nerd, I heard that
Four Eyes, been called that before
They just jealous
Oyster Perpetuals, four I's for four
Chillin in my race car, gorilla like Bapestar
I lay law, I'm a villain and I break heart
And I ain't into offending no feelings
And if I did it, just means that you been chillin
With the great... Carrera... Lu

[Hook: Prolyfic & Lupe Fiasco]
You best, slow down
Cause you speeding
(I'm bout my money, bout my paper
Bout my money, Joe)
You best, slow down
Cause you speeding
(I'm bout my money, bout my paper
Bout my money, Joe)

[Outro]
I'm bout my money, bout my paper
Bout my money, Joe
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
I was like Porsche puller, Air Force footer
Automatic wristed therefore shook-up
Causing a stir every time I push up
007 with a jester and a look-up
It's Carrera-Ella from the F&F crew
With a tiger on his shirt, alligator on his blues
With a nice young lady and some righteous kung-fu
I'm fighting without fighting, enlightening you young fools
Frankensteins of mine, I tighten you young screws
Send lighting to your mind and make you move
Car like cannonball, run!
I'm lighting my guns fuse, one:
That mean I'll lean and leave you, I mean this, Needlz
They hook to my hooks, they rehearse my verse
And they sing my singles I can't even see you

[Hook]
With it tilted, brim low, brim low
With a Cartier eye and his car go by like
NEEEEEEOOOOOWWWWW!
Tilted (tilted), brim low, brim low
With a Cartier eye, and his car go by like
NEEEEEEOOOOOWWWWW!
Fresh-to-def F&F!

[Verse 2]
I wear Cartier glasses, Van dutch pants-es
Gameboy Advances next to the black berry
I'm next to my black berry Molasses
Hat very slanted rapping to the riders
Writer of the stances driver of the riders
Matter of fact Shur the chauffeur
Reverse the fifteen teen is so serve
The serve is so mean like I served in the marines
And it's full metal jacket
Upset the jokers every time I draft it
They trys to jack it change my will
I can wait for triple A I remain, I chill
Even still niggas don't know the drill
And I mean it needles
Just hook em with my hooks, they rehearse my verse
And they sing my singles I can't even see you

[Hook]
With it tilted, brim low, brim low
With a Cartier eye and his car go by like
NEEEEEEOOOOOWWWWW!
Tilted (tilted), brim low, brim low
With a Cartier eye, and his car go by like
NEEEEEEOOOOOWWWWW!
Fresh-to-def F&F!

[Verse 3]
F, F I to the A S C O, flyin' like Neo
They lien' like Leo, Cleo maybe they fronted
But they ain't never done it like he though
Refering to me Joe!
I feed them through the bars like CO's
I lead them through the harm like a Hero
Peaceful
But I can bring the violence like Nero
Right to your keyhole then bring it back to silence
Cause that's the G-Code
Which means that if you brought it or your about to bring it on
But tell the polices I ain't seen it because I had it

[Hook]
Tilted, brim low, brim low
With a Cartier eye and his car go by like
NEEEEEEOOOOOWWWWW!
Tilted (tilted), brim low, brim low
With a Cartier eye, and his car go by like
NEEEEEEOOOOOWWWWW!
Fresh-to-def F&F!

[Gunshot]

[Intro]
Hold it now!
You just walk up to her and say hi
That's all you gotta do
Say hi
That's all you gotta do
Say hi

[Verse 1]
Well I know I'm not the coolest
And this might sound kind of foolish
Cause I know I'm not the smoothest, told myself I shouldn't do this
Cause I'm not very well-suited, not the popular-est of students
We ain't in the same crowd, always see you with the hoopers
But we got the same lunch, you might see me with the cooler
That's cause I don't eat pork, you can never be sure of
Oh, you like Linkin Park? That's the hat from the tour
I got an autographed shirt, they wrote, "much love 2 ya"
Man that's really funny how we like the same music
But I really love jazz, I was gonna play the tuba
I tried to join the band, they said I was really, really bad
Didn't really make me sad, I'm used to being the loser
But you, I think you're super, so much, I had to pursue ya
I don't believe the things they say or the football team's rumors
The quarterback can't spell, I'm his after-school tutor
I just took a cue from Cupid, but, now I think it's stupid
I'm-I'm sorry
And then I walked away
Thinkin' that she would never talk to me
Like what were you thinking bringing up the band
Would have got a better result
If would have just beat her up and ran
You shouldn't have worn your glasses
Take your shirt up out your pants
See now it's all over and you won't get another chance
Damn, I was so close to her, then I felt a hand on my shoulder

[Verse 2]
She said, "I know you're not the coolest
But I swear you are the cutest
And I know you played the tuba, I seen you at the recital
It takes a lot to get up there and embarrass yourself
But you shouldn't put down, you should merit yourself
That just mean you not a punk, I like Thelonious Monk
He's the wallpaper on my computer
I love Final Fantasy, I hate first person shooters (me too)
"Meteora" was nice but I bought "Hybrid Theory" twice
Half of the cheerleading squad is in a stupor
The only reason I do it is 'cause my mother took state
When she was a junior
And she want me to do the same, so I'm like, naww
I wanna be an oncologist and diagnose tumors
I got a a pet parrot, his name is 'Mr. Tuna'
My favorite food is fish, remember that for the future
My IM name is missluna, you can hit me after six"

[Interlude]
How you feelin' right now?
Yes yes yes yes yes yes
Come, Seymour, we have things to do!
(How you feeling right now?)
And just like everything in life
Things grow, People grow
And people grow apart
It's like some things were just never meant to be
You see?
But, then again
Maybe
Some things are

[Verse 3]
You know today gonna be the coolest
And you know how far your school is
Know how dangerous the flu is, so button up your coat
And finish off your breakfast, you know how important fuel is
Food is to human as buoyancy's to boat
I knew this, everyday we gotta go through this
And I ask why you quote, cuz I'm your father Lucas
Pop, last night I was lookin over the futures
Commodities is felon, rental properties is sellin
The bio tech market share is at its hugest
I think we should ride this wave, we can't re-invent the Rubik's
Woah, we should of played her more music
Lucas, dear, why is your bookbag full of tulips

[Outro]
Umm, well Ma, you see there's this girl, you know
And I was thinking that I may walk to her, you know
Try and talk to her
Discuss different things that were taught to her
And see what makes her tick
You know? You know Mama?

[Intro: Lupe Fiasco & The Spinners]
No one does it better
(I said do it, do it) No one does it better
What down Charlie?
How you doing? Good, hey what up Joe?
I'm just chilling, know what I'm saying chilling, ain't nothing, yo
I said nah man, there's people out there better than me
I just do what I do, you know what I'm saying? Yeah aight

[Verse 1]
Uh, I can't feel a field nigga pain
Devious skill that make a strong willed nigga wane
Since a lil nigga hang with the killers and distributers of 'caine
They dismemberers of swishers then refill it with the Jane
Then they tilt it and they lit it with a flame
Then they took a pull of killer to the brain like (inhale noise) ah
Evil minded like Krang they became
They deranged like the Rover that I rode
That was the Range that I drove when I was a little bit older, mayne
Declaring war on the deck like they The Joker
All while, ducking from Bruce Wayne
While they polka with the devil in our moonlitten ghetto
Hello My Name stickers on the stickers of the veins
In rehab, remembering the feelings when they used to get mellow
When they was all back of a nickel like Monticello
When the underworld had to be smarter than Donatello
No honor amongst fellows
It's harder than sitting with a blind man and
Trying to describe yellow
Got me feeling like killer Joe
My life the album, know the classics by heart
And exactly how the filler go
Repeat it on my way to the liquor store, Charlie

[Interlude]
What's up, what's down what down
You know, how are you (..) what you in for? (..) stupid niggas
You know I'm sayin, it's why I do what I do
I be aight, we all be aight
We just gotta learn how to stay in our lane
And do what we know how to do, you know

[Verse 2]
'Cause, I can't feel the field nigga chains
Though I covet mine, so I covered mine in bling
Then I bumped into a bum and covered mine in shame
Then I bumped into a hun and uncovered mine again
Diamonds then under minded mayne
They give a nigga with no mack another kinda game
See money talks in another kinda slang
Detectives can't decipher as they listen through the wire
As I accept the call and listen to the lifer
Getting religion, making wudhu in the sink of your cell
Reciting Al-Fatiha in the kitchen
Indeed on his deen and in addition to doing dishes
Listen as I get schooled to the rules to rule
The fuel of fools, the obstacles, the cool
Had to slow it down homie
Chopped and screwed, he said blow it down for me
Sticks and stones make the homes
Only God's words can stop the wolves
And don't fraternize with pigs those kids'll think your stool
Not at the bar but trying to put him behind the bar like a bartender
He laid the law like the bar so I put it in a bar for dude
He said, borrow my jewels and bar the fools
'Cause they'll play ya like the space bar in Tools
Theme music to a drive-by, put it in your car and cruise, uh, uh

[Intro: Justin Vernon]
I shoot the lights out
Hide 'til it's bright out
Oh, just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good bloodsucker
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles, all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Uh, the best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
Matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple-double, no assists
And my only focus is stayin' on some bogus shit
Arguin' with my older bitch, actin' like I owe her shit
I heard the beat, the same raps that gave the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga, but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, "This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now"
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it "Malibooyah"
Goddamn, Yeezy always hit 'em with a new style
Know that motherfucker, well, what you gon' do now?
Whatever I wanna do, gosh, it's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So, mami, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ah, put the pussy in a sarcophagus
Now she claiming that I bruised her esophagus
Head of the class and she just won a swallowship
I'm livin' in the future so the present is my past
My presence is a present, kiss my ass

[Chorus: Kanye West & Jay Z]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert (Yeah)
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands

[Verse 3: Jay Z]
Sasquatch, Godzilla, King Kong, Loch Ness
Goblin, ghoul, a zombie with no conscience
Question, what do these things all have in common?
Everybody knows I'm a motherfuckin' monster
Conquer, stomp ya, stop your silly nonsense
Nonsense, none of you niggas know where the swamp is
None of you niggas have seen the carnage that I've seen
I still hear fiends scream in my dreams
Murder, murder in black convertibles, I
Kill a block, I murder the avenues, I
Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and bloodsuckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Millin' about, spillin' they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins
I smell a massacre
Seems to be the only way to back you bastards up

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands

[Verse 4: Nicki Minaj]
Pull up in the monster, automobile gangsta
With a bad bitch that came from Sri Lanka
Yeah, I'm in that Tonka, color of Willy Wonka
You could be the king, but watch the queen conquer
Okay, first things first, I'll eat your brains
Then I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a motherfuckin' monster do
Hair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, dutty wine it, wine it
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really, really I don't give an F-U-C-K
"Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki, sh-she's fake"
"She on a diet," but my pockets eatin' cheesecake
And I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's child's play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides, Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you, and Am' should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Ah, I'm a motherfuckin' monster

[Outro: Justin Vernon & Charlie Wilson]
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home (Headed home)
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide, 'cide (No)
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home (Head home)
I, I crossed the limelight (No, the limelight)
And I'll, I'll let God decide, 'cide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home

[Verse 1]
Ah, ah!
I'm sittin' in the crib dreamin' about Lear jets and coupes
The way Salt shoops and how to sell records like Snoop (oops!)
I'm interrupted by a doorbell
3:52 - who the hell is this?
I gets up quick, cocks my shit
Stop the dogs from barkin', then proceed to walkin'
It's a face that I seen before
My nigga Sing, we used to sling on the 16th floor
Check it!
I look deeper; I see blood up on his sneakers
And his fist gripped a chrome four-fifth
So I dip
Nigga, is you creepin' or speakin'?
He tells me C-Rock just got hit up at the Beacon
I opens up the door, pitiful: "Is he in critical?"
Retaliation for this one won't be minimal
'Cause I'm a criminal way before the rap shit
Bust the gat shit, Puff won't even know what happened
If it's done smoothly, silencers on the Uzi
Stash in the hooptie, my alibi: any cutie
With a booty that done fuck Big Pop
Head spinnin', reminiscin' 'bout my man C-Rock

[Chorus]
Somebody gotta die
If I go, you got to go
Somebody got to die
Let the gunshots blow
Somebody got to die
Nobody got to know
That I killed yo' ass in the mist, bitch
Somebody got to die
If I go, you got to go
Somebody gotta die
Let the gunshots blow
Somebody got to die
Nobody got to know
That I killed yo' ass in the mist, bitch

[Verse 2]
Uhh, fillin' clips, he explained our situation
Precisely, so we know exactly what we facin'
"Some kid named Jason
In a Honda station wagon
Was braggin', about how much loot and crack he stackin'
Rock had a grip so they formed up a clique
A small crew, 'round the time I was locked up with you"
"True indeed"
"But yo, nigga, let me proceed
Don't fill them clips too high
Give them bullets room to breathe
Damn, where was I? Yeah
Went outta town, blew the fuck up
D-Roc went home
And Jay got stuck the fuck up
Hit him twice, caught him right for the Persian white
Pistol whipped his kids and taped up his wife (niggas is trife)
He figured Rock set 'em up, no question
Wet 'em up no less
Than 50 shots in his direction" (uhh)
"How many shots?"
"Man, nigga, I seen mad holes"
"What kinda gats?"
"Hitchlinks, Kochs, and Calicos"
But fuck that
I know where all them niggas rest at
In the buildin' hustlin'
And they don't be strapped
Supreme and Black is downstairs, the engine runnin'
Find a bag to put the guns in
And c'mon if you're comin'

[Chorus]
Somebody gotta die
If I go, you got to go
Somebody got to die
Let the gunshots blow
Somebody got to die
Nobody got to know
That I killed yo' ass in the mist, bitch
Somebody got to die
If I go, you got to go
Somebody gotta die
Let the gunshots blow
Somebody got to die
Nobody got to know
That I killed yo' ass in the mist, bitch

[Verse 3]
Exchanged hugs and pounds before the throwdown
How it's gon' go down?
Lay these niggas low-down
"Slow down, ah, fuck all that plannin' shit
Run up in they cribs and make the cats abandon ship!"
See niggas like you do ten-year bids
Miss the nigga they want and murder innocent kids
Not I
One nigga's in my eye, that's Jason
Ain't no slugs gonna be wasted
Revenge I'm tastin' at the tip of my lips
I can't wait to fill my clip in his hips
"Pass the chocolate, Thai!"
Sing ain't lie
There's Jason with his back to me
Talkin' to his faculty
I start to get a funny feeling
Put the mask on in case this nigga start squealin'
Scream his name out: ("Ay yo, playboy!")
Squeezed six, nothin' shorter
Nigga turned around holdin' his daughter

[Intro: B.o.B & (Ricco Barrino)]
What's up, what's, down
Ladies and gentleman we are entering into the fifth dimension
And did I mention, we gone? Ha ha ha. We gone. We gone
(B.o.B, B.o.B, give it to 'em, shortie)

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Girl, I'm eons and eons beyond these peons
Another human like me there will never be one
The planet that I'm from, I can't even speak on
The stars is what I sleep on
The moon I put my feet on
The way my aura glow, you'd swear I'm made of neon
Cooler than the freon, that's in your Dodge Neon
They say the future is now, to me it hasn't begun
Stay tuned to me and their will never be a re-run
So come and leap on my body and as we come
You'll probably feel moist like the trees on the tropics
We gone, we out it, no we don't need rockets
We hop up on the mother ship an we gone, we slidin'
We slippin' through dimensions, we hyper space glidin'
Blastin' through the atmosphere
Frightenin' in the lightenin'
I know I'm out my mind girl, but you know you like it
So hope up on my cosmic highway so can ride it

[Hook: Ricco Barrino]
Shorty are you going, my way?
Come and ride on my, my cosmic highway
Ooh, let's go
Ooh, let's go
Look, shorty I can't stay on the Earth no more
Another galaxy we must go

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Well, fresh up out the sky I'm like a meteorite
So when the studio, no, I don't need to go write
Man I just came up in the game 'cause y'all just needed more life
So, so by the time I'm done their ain't gonna be no more mics
And people ask me, "B.o.B what kind of language is that?"
'Cause I may blast into the future, I may never come back
And I'm a leave with a 30,000 light year leap
Headed to a distant planet called B.o.B
And then I'm gone
Man they not ignoring me
Taking off from half court Air Jordan
All systems go in 10 seconds I'm orbiting
Hanging in the Cosmos like a space ornament
Heat 'em up like a solar panel, yes I bring the pain
Similar to asteroid that's headed to your brain
My lane is something that they really cannot explain
They try to hold me down but man it's me they can't contain

[Hook: Ricco Barrino]
Shorty are you going, my way?
Come and ride on my, my cosmic highway
Ooh, let's go
Ooh, let's go
Look, shorty I can't stay on the Earth no more
Another galaxy we must go

[Bridge: Ricco Barrino]
Come and go with me, I'll take you to my galaxy
I'm talkin' 'bout Venus, Jupiter, Mars, Mars, Mars
And I'm sayin' girl, let's ride all night
And I need you for this ship girl to take flight
Let's go, let's go
Come on baby let me take it off
Another second we gone blast it off

[Hook: Ricco Barrino]
Shorty are you going, my way?
Come and ride on my, my cosmic highway
Ooh, let's go
Ooh, let's go
Look, shorty I can't stay on the Earth no more
Another galaxy we must go

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I’ll get a chance
To see you when I close my eyes
I’m going outta my head
Lost in a fairytale
Can you hold my hands and be my guide?
Clouds filled with stars, cover your skies
And I hope it rains, you’re the perfect lullaby
What kinda dream is this?

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don’t wanna wake up from you
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your loves to good to be true
My guilty pleasure I ain’t going no where
Baby long as you’re here
I’ll be floating on air cause you’re my
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don’t wanna wake up from you

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, yo, Young Money right here
Bike here, throw it up, no high chair
Cold like a white bear
Freddy Krueger I'm a rap bitch nightmare
And I’m rich, I could buy you
Kill bitches, leave their body in the Bayou
More brain than a IQ
More head than a dread, my youte
And my bank account ain’t hardly empty
That’s why I come through in a Barbie Bentley
So please mamacita, please no envy
When you come around it reads no entry
Who’s next to go?
My flows so flexible
Get gas, then get at me, Texaco
Shoot yourself in the leg, Plaxico
White jag with the twisted lip
I ain't Mike Jack but "This is it!"
B-b-b-boo I'm everywhere
You're like balloon boy, mama, you was never there!
I am the Kung Fu Panda
Fuck all your blogs, fuck all your propaganda
Good for the goose, then its good for the gander
Nicki ain't a rapper, Nicki is a brander
Please, you can never compare to me
All these bitches is scared of me
I am who they couldn’t even dare to be
So that's all folks, badabadee
I go hard, pause
Hospital flow, get more gauze
I'm a bad bitch on all fours
The President be like, "It's all yours!"
Weezy and Nicki bring the A-game, high stats
Go together like Ricky and his eye patch
Go together like a team in the gym
Kareem and the ring, the queen and the king

[Bridge: Beyoncé & Lil Wayne]
Tattoo your name across my heart
So it will remain
Not even death could make us part (No Ceilings!)
What kind of dream is this?
You could be a sweet--

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Uh, kush it out, red bone, pussy, mouth
Eat you up, spit you out, fuck your girl in your house
I’m terrible, be careful, you might want say a prayer or two
So cold, I need theraflu, I'm so high, I need parachutes
I'm error proof, I'm never spooked, got my coupe, heaven blue
And my flag red as hell, think you're sweet as devils food
I never lose, my weapons use
Fuck with me wrong, shit get ugly, Devin Dude
And she’s the queen, two’s a couple, three’s a scene
Weezy that nigga that you see in your dreams, get the pussy wet, Abita Springs
Hah, I'm Easter clean, shout to my home girl, Mika Means
Anything we want we redeem, you niggas gassed up, ‘93 Supreme
Nicki Minaj is the hardest bitch, more than an artist, bitch
She talk a whole lot of shit and walk around like she President Carter's bitch
She be on her Barbie shit, and me? I'm on Tha Carter VI
And I can turn crumbs to bricks, and I can turn nuns to tricks
Hah, Young Mula baby, f-fuck your feelings
And this is No Ceilings, yeah

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don’t wanna wake up from you
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your loves to good to be true
My guilty pleasure I ain’t going no where
Baby long as you’re here
I’ll be floating on air cause you’re my
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I, don’t wanna wake up from you

[Intro]
Oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
What a world that I'm living in
Will the rainstorms ever end?
(Still I feel my) Path narrow, I run again
Seem happiness is gone again
(And then you see 'em) Grey clouds up above mayne
Metaphoric to my life mayne
(Still I feel my) Heart stronger than it's ever been
Strong will 'til my journey ends
(Until then I roll) More than I ever rolled
Not pills, but the Mary though
(Still I feel my) Eyes heavy when the day goes
Nothing helping when my head doze
(But I ain't sleep) Awake in another state
Living in a new space
(Still I feel my) Mind running at a steady pace
God help me so I'll win the race
(Until then I go)

[Chorus]
(Ahh) The sky might fall
(Ahh) The sky might fall
(Ahh, ahh) But I'm not worried at all, c'mon, c'mon
(Ahh) The sky might fall
(Ahh) The sky might fall
(Ahh, ahh) But I'm not worried at all

[Post-Chorus]
Hey, hey, I let 'em know somethin'
I let 'em know somethin', I let 'em know somethin'
You can listen up, a-listen up
A-listen up, a-listen up
Hey, I let 'em know somethin'
I let 'em know somethin', I let 'em know somethin'
You can listen up, a-listen up
A-listen up, a-listen up

[Verse 2]
Grey clouds stuck together fam
Lightning piercing through another land
Over the desert where the lost play
Soul searching each and every way
(And then you see the) Awesome sound, so profound
When it– it'll grip you
(You can see it) If you hear it you can feel it too
Something special I am running to
(Until then I go) Away, very far away
To another universe where all the people say
It's the new-new place for the special to embrace
Like a Martian who seemingly wandered out of place
Take what you need from the valley of the hope, where
Even if you drown you'll be floating higher up, and
You can say bye, bye, bye
Sky might be falling but remember you can fly high

[Chorus]
(Ahh) The sky might fall
(Ahh) The sky might fall
(Ahh, ahh) But I'm not worried at all, c'mon, c'mon
(Ahh) The sky might fall
(Ahh) The sky might fall
(Ahh, ahh) But I'm not worried at all

[Post-Chorus]
Hey, hey, I let 'em know somethin'
I let 'em know somethin', I let 'em know somethin'
You can listen up, a-listen up
A-listen up, a-listen up
Hey, I let 'em know somethin'
I let 'em know somethin', I let 'em know somethin'
You can listen up, a-listen up
A-listen up, a-listen up

[Outro]
I keep running, yeah
I gotta keep up, I gotta keep up, yeah
Gotta keep up, I gotta keep up
And I keep running, yeah
I gotta keep up, I gotta keep up, yeah
Gotta keep up, I gotta keep up, yeah
'Cause I'm gone
Yeah, na-na na-na, na-na na-na
I'm up, and away
Na-na, na-na
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Hey, hey

[Intro: Raekwon]
Visual visual, JB
Yo, Ye, what up? Raekwon

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
You got stacks like the International House of Pancakes
All alone, ready to phone me and your hand shakes
Palms is wet, a don's regret
Never to walk miles for love, I sit in the starter's deck
It just happened, I was floatin', you seen the captain?
Blinked at me then I threw him my thinking cap
Take her, then we could slide to Jamaica
Shop for like a year or two, stop in Diego
It's obvious, I want to see who your mami is
We just friends so she can't Clyde, Bonnie this
Fly walls, dinin' in fly halls
Come to the master suite, leave every piece in the master hall
All my money tied in knots
Stand over there, that's why I make it happen on blocks
Brazil cut sweater, Audi leather
Playin' the field, tryin' to out-slick Baretta

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
You see my baby up and hit the road
Where she's going? That's what nobody knows
I need to find her 'fore another man does
I wouldn't want him to steal my love

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'm just tryna be cool, cool, cool
Tryna be cool, what you expect me to do?
I'm just tryna find, find, find this sweet love of mine

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Last name West and my teeth diamonds
She said, "Yo, what's your occupation, crazy rhymin'?"
Listen to Wu-Tang, tryin' suits on
Accoutrements is Grey Poupon
Stuntin' in a high-top Louis, shorts is the Coogis
Open up the door when you take her to the movies
When you meet the parents, you tell De Niro
Her boyfriend a zero, she need to cut the weirdo
Next show, they gotta up the zeros
Nobody rockin' like this sixteen years old
The hard drums and the Wally's somethin' that caught me
I'm tellin' you what Wu-Tang taught me
The young youth, rockin' the gold tooth
Pull up in a drop top, old school bumpin' to "Cash Rules"
No question, we the reason why the summer's blazin'
Then say, "You lookin' good, fly colored Asian"
Raw, I give it to ya, no trivia
She used to roll with my G-Unit like Olivia
'Til she caught me gettin' numbers and hugs
I guess that's the day she became a runaway love

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love

[Bridge: Justin Bieber]
Why can't I find you, love of mine
When you're standing in front of my face?
Oh why, I must be blind?
How did I let you get away?
Hahah, yeah

[Verse 4: Raekwon]
Leave it up to the most high, sittin' in ghost fly
Chillin' with two of my brothers
We both live on deck, baggin' 'em on set
This is how we roll independent, she a go, I'ma go get
Take that queen or shorty up
We can live it up every month, baby girl, just call me up
Wakin' up, restin' in cold sweats
Thinkin' of this ****, the videotapes, even the stress
My mind is a terrible thing to waste
No love lost, I know I'm goin' crazy, I can't floss
Me, my lady, left my homies, it's all baloney
Just like rockin' the old Ponys
So when I'm chillin', I'm just lost, no more feelin'
I need my honey in my life, get that? Feel me?
Take your time, Rae, Justin, yeah, you shine
My runaway love didn't mind, come on

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love

[Intro]
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, okay
Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright, stop, pajama time

[Verse 1]
Come here, little kiddies, on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap?
And I don't mean "rap" as in a new case
Of child molestation accusations
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, no worries
Papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I done touched on everything but little boys
And that's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes, and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bung-hole
And it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
Give a little poot-poot, it's okay
Oops, my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip

[Chorus]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah, boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Just lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Go crazy (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Oh, baby (Ah-ah), oh, baby, baby (Ah-ah)

[Post-Chorus]
Well, it's Friday and it's my day
Just to party all the way 'til Sunday
Maybe 'til Monday, I don't know what day
Every day's just a holiday
Cruisin' on the freeway, feelin' kinda breezy
Let the top down and my hair blow
I don't know where I'm goin', all I know is
When I get there someone's gonna touch my body

[Verse 2]
'Scuse me, miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair?
Spit on me? Maybe gouge my eyes out? (Yeah)
Now, what's your name, girl? What's your sign?
Man, you must be up out your mind
Dre (Ah-ah), beer goggles, blind
I'm just tryin' to unwind, now I'm

[Chorus]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah, boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Just lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Go crazy (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Oh, baby (Ah-ah), oh, baby, baby (Ah-ah)

[Post-Chorus]
Well, it's Tuesday and I'm locked up
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
They say I was runnin' butt-naked
Down the street screamin' (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Your honor, I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much, I'm not guilty
They said, "Save it, boy, we got you on tape"
Yellin' at an old lady to touch my body

[Verse 3]
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It gets real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now snap back to reality look, it's B. Rabbit
Yo, you signed me up to battle? I'm a grown man
Chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubby
I don't have any lines to go right here, so chubba-Teletubby
Fellas (What?) Fellas (What?)
Grab your left nut, make your right one jealous (What?)
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls
Tall girls, small girls, I'm calling all girls
Everyone report to the dance floor
It's your chance for a little romance or
Butt squeezin', it's the season
Just go (Ah-ah-ah-ah), so appeasin'

[Chorus]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah, boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Just lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Go crazy (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Oh, baby (Ah-ah), oh, baby, baby (Ah-ah)

[Outro]
Touch my body
Touch my body
Oh boy, just touch my body
I mean girl, just touch my body

[Intro]
Hit me
Right in the sternum this time, T-Baby
Shit, you already know, you already know, you already know
Damn
Shit, this that hustler music
Young Weezy got that motherfuckin' hustler music
So ride to it, y'all, vibe to it, y'all, damn

[Verse 1]
Goddamn, Mix done hit a nigga in his head with this one
I'ma paint the city red with this one
I'm ahead with this one
See, you fucking with the boy who tote toys way before Christmas
No assistance just that persistence with that commitment if
I don't get it, somebody gon' die tonight
I know my vibe is tight and I deserve the throne
And if the kid ain't right, then let me die in this song
See, I be ridin', just ridin' alone
With my daddy on my mind like, "You gotta be kidding"
How the hell you ain't here to see your prince do his thing?
Sometimes I wanna drop a tear, but no emotions from a king
Shall be, so I be who I be, that's me
That's Weezy F Baby, and please say the motherfuckin'
So I be who I be, that's me
That's Weezy F Baby, and please say the motherfuckin'

[Chorus]
Baby, you gotta know that I'm just out here
Doin' what I gotta do for me and you, and we eatin'
So, bitch, why the fuck is you tripping?
I'm takin' these chances
My head to the sky, my feet on the ground
My fingers to the judge, if the money don't move
Then I won't budge, won't budge
No, I won't budge, no, Lord

[Verse 2]
Money is the motivation, facing the avenue
Back touching the wall, got the weed, got the gun
Gotta run when I hear the bird call (Brr), damn (Brr)
Hop in that thing and murk off, swerve off
You know me, they call me Birdman Junior (Ah-ah)
Anybody murderer if Birdman sponsor it (For sure, nigga, get you, you heard?)
Phantom of the Opera, all black, guap tint, locked in
I can let them shots out, you can't get no shots in
Bulletproof, leave a nigga with a bullet-roof
Shoot ya in your mouth, Leroy, they call him bullet-tooth
I'm like, "What it do? What it do?"
There's a full court pressure, I'm just goin' for the two
If I'm open for the three, I'ma take it in a second
Even if there's one second, I'ma make it, it's nothin'
I don't take it for granted, I don't take it for nothin'
I take it for what it's worth to the dirt, motherfucker, yeah

[Chorus]
Baby, you gotta know that I'm just out here
Doin' what I gotta do for me and you, and we eatin'
So, bitch, why the fuck is you tripping?
I'm takin' these chances
My head to the sky, my feet on the ground
My fingers to the judge, if the money don't move
Then I won't budge, won't budge
No, I won't budge, no, Lord

[Verse 3]
I ain't never killed nobody, I promise
And I promise if you try me, he gon' have to rewind this track
And make me go back, that thing'll go rrat
That boy'll lay flat, so flat
That act is what I perform amongst you haters
Got nina in my palm and I'm masturbating
Black Peter Pan, fly 'til I die, what you sayin'?
Bathing Ape, Yves Saint, Evisu what I stay in
Got me feeling like Scarface, light the Cohiba
Streets reply I look right in a four-seater
You know I be out here right in a four-seater
Top floor of the Four Seasons
Four of them whores
And they all know how to cook it up
And look I got some
And only one know how to bag, bitch, bundle up
See, it's a cold world, so homie, bundle up
We ain't on this grind for nothin', now get your hustle up

[Chorus]
Baby, you gotta know that I'm just out here
Doin' what I gotta do for me and you, and we eatin'
So, bitch, why the fuck is you tripping?
I'm takin' these chances
My head to the sky, my feet on the ground
My fingers to the judge, if the money don't move
Then I won't budge, won't budge
No, I won't budge, no, Lord
Baby, you gotta know that I'm just out here
Doin' what I gotta do for me and you, and we eatin'
So, bitch, why the fuck is you tripping?
I'm takin' these chances
My head to the sky, my feet on the ground
My fingers to the judge, if the money don't move
Then I won't budge, won't budge
No, I won't budge, no, Lord

[Outro]
Man, man, this be that hustler music
Young Weezy got that motherfuckin' hustler music, y'all
So ride to it, y'all, and vibe to it, y'all
I'm asking y'all, please, please
Young Weezy got that hustler music
Young Weezy got that motherfuckin' hustler music
Ride to it, y'all, vibe to it, y'all, vibe to it y'all, yeah, yeah, woo
It's real shit, man, it's real talk, man
It's how we do it, how we did it, how we done it, ayy
It's real shit, man, it's real talk, boy
It's how we do it, how we did it, how we done it
I ain't braggin', I ain't boastin', it's the way it go
I ain't braggin', I ain't boastin', it's the way it is
Better guard your kids, guard your face
Better guard your body, we warned the place

Fuck bitches, it's Young Money, nigga

[Intro: Diana King & The Notorious B.I.G.]
No big up our gun men, seen? (Big up, big up)
Cuh dis ah '94 when ah RAA fi kill people and kyaan dun
Nuh waan pussy hole hold di kaanah
Watch this, lawd

[Chorus: Diana King]
Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
Informer lone keep informer friend

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
1970 something, nigga I don't sweat the date
My moms is late so I had to plan my escape
Out the skins, in this world of fly girls
Tanqueray and Hennessy until I call hurl
Ten months in this gut, what the fuck?
I wish moms would hurry up so I could get buck
Wild juvenile ripping mics and shit
New York, New York, ready for the likes of this
Then came the worst date, May 21st
2:19, that's when my mama water burst
No spouse in the house so she rode for self
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help
Umbilical cord's wrapped around my neck
I'm seeing my death and I ain't even took my first step
I made it out, I'm bringing mad joy
The doctor looked and said, "He's going to be a bad boy"

[Chorus: Diana King]
Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
Informer lone keep informer friend

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Now I'm thirteen, smoking blunts, making cream
On the drug scene, fuck a football team
Risking ruptured spleens by the age of sixteen
Hearing the coach scream ain't my lifetime dream
I mean, I want to blow up, stack my dough up
So school I didn't show up, it fucked my flow up
Mom said that I should grow up and check myself
Before I wreck myself, disrespect myself
Put the drugs on the shelf? Nah, couldn't see it
Scarface, King of New York, I want to be it
Rap was secondary, money was necessary
Until I got incarcerated, kinda scary
C74-Mark 8 set me straight
Not able to move behind the great steel gate
Time to contemplate, damn, where did I fail?
All the money I stacked was all the money for bail

[Chorus: Diana King]
Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
Informer lone keep informer friend
Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
Informer lone keep informer friend

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Ninety-four, now I explore new horizons
Mama smile when she see me, that's surprising
Honeys is tantalizing, they freak all night
Keep ducking cops on the creep all night
As I open my eyes and realizing I changed
Not the same deranged child stuck up in the game
And to my niggas living street life
Learn to treat life to the best, put stress to rest
Still tote your vest man, niggas be tripping
In the streets without a gat? Nah, nigga you're slipping
If I'm dipping on The F with weed on my breath
Original hustler with the muffler on the TEC
Respect to the macks in the Ac's
To the freaks in the Jeeps, lick shots to my peeps

[Chorus: Diana King]
Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
Informer lone keep informer friend
Me holla respect, to all the gun men dem
Gun men alone, keep gun men friend
Fire bun, fi all the informer dem
Informer lone keep informer friend

[Intro]
Biggie Smalls is the illest (Uh)
What? Uh
Biggie— Biggie— Biggie Smalls is the illest
Uh
Biggie Smalls, Biggie— Biggie— Biggie Smalls
Biggie— Biggie— Biggie Smalls is the illest
Uh, yeah
Biggie— Biggie— Biggie Smalls is the illest

[Verse 1]
Live from Bedford-Stuyvesant, the livest one
Representing BK to the fullest
Gats, I pull it
Bastards ducking when B.I.G. be bucking
Chickenheads be clucking, in my back room fucking
It ain't nothing
They know B.I.G. be handling
With the MAC in the Ac' door paneling
Bandaging MC's, oxygen, they can't breathe
Mad tricks up the sleeve
Wear boxers so my dick can breathe
Breeze through in the Q
Forty-five by my side, lyrical high
And those that rushes my clutches get put on crutches
Get smoked like Dutches from the master
Hate to blast ya but I have to
You see I smoke a lot
Your life is played out like Kwame
And them fucking polka dots
Who rock the spot? Biggie
You know how the weed go, unbelievable

[Chorus]
It's unbelievable
Biggie Smalls is the illest
It's unbelievable
Biggie— Biggie— Biggie Smalls is the illest
It's unbelievable
Biggie— Biggie— Biggie Smalls is the illest
It's unbelievable
Biggie— Biggie— Biggie Smalls is the illest

[Verse 2]
B-I-G, G-I-E
A-K-A., B-I-G
Get it? Biggie
Also known as the bon appétit
Rappers can't sleep need sleeping
B.I.G. keep creeping
Bullets heat-seeking, casualties need treating
Dumb rappers need teaching
Lesson A: Don't fuck with B-I
That's that "Oh I, thought he was wack"
Oh, come, come now, why y'all so dumb now
Hunt me or be hunted
I got three hundred and fifty-seven ways
To simmer sauté, I'm the winner all day
Lights get dimmer down Biggie's hallway
My forte causes Caucasians to say
"He sounds demented"
Car weed scented, if I said it, I meant it
Bite my tongue for no one
Call me evil, or unbelievable

[Chorus]
It's unbelievable
Biggie Smalls is the illest
It's unbelievable
Biggie— Biggie— Biggie Smalls is the illest
It's unbelievable
Biggie Smalls is the illest
It's unbelievable
Biggie— Biggie— Biggie Smalls is the illest

[Verse 3]
Buck shots out the sun roof of Lexus coupes
Leave no witnesses, what you think this is?
Ain't no amateurs here
I damage and tear, MC's fear me
They too near not to hear me
Clearly, I'm the triple beam dream
One thousand grams of uncut to the gut
It seems fucked up, the way I touched up the grill
Trying to play gorilla when you ain't no killer
The gat's by your liver, your upper lip quiver
Get ready to die, tell God I said hi
And throw down some ice for the nicest MC
Niggas know the steelo, unbelievable

[Chorus]
It's unbelievable
Biggie Smalls is the illest
It's unbelievable
Biggie— Biggie— Biggie Smalls is the illest
It's unbelievable
Biggie— Biggie— Biggie Smalls is the illest
It's unbelievable
Biggie— Biggie— Biggie Smalls is the illest

[Outro]
It's unbelievable
Biggie— Biggie— Biggie Smalls is the illest
'Believable
Biggie— Biggie— Biggie Smalls is the illest
'Believable
Biggie— Biggie— Biggie Smalls is the illest
Biggie Smalls— Biggie— Biggie— Biggie Smalls
Biggie— Biggie— Biggie Smalls is the illest

[Intro]
Oh! Yeah! So much for first single on this one

[Verse 1]
Shady's the label, Aftermath is the stable
That the horses come out of—erra
Of course we're about to stir up
Some shit thick as Mrs. Buttersworth's syrup
It's the Mr. Picked-on-Christopher-Reeves-just-for-no-reason
Other than to—just to tease him
'Cause he was his biggest (*burp*) fan
He used to be Superman, now I'm pourin'
Liquor on the curb in his name for him
"Eminem, you wait 'til we meet up again, fucker
I'm kickin' your ass for everything you've ever said."
It goes one for the money, two for the fuckin' show
Ready, get set, let's go
Here comes the buckin' bronco
Stompin' and stampedin' up the damn street like them buffalo
Soldiers, I told ya I'm 'bout to blow, so look out below, Geronimo
Motherfuckers, it's dominoes, I'm on a roll
Around and around I go
When will I stop? I don't know
Tryin' to pick up where The Eminem Show left off
But I know anything's possible
Though I'm not gonna top what I sold
I'm at the top of my game, that shit is not gonna change
Long as I got Dr. Dre on my team I'll get away
With murder: I'm like O.J., he's like my Cochran today
We keep the Mark Fuhrman tapes
In a safe, locked 'em away (*slam*)
Better watch what you say
Just when you thought you were safe
Them fuckers got you on tape
You swear to God you was playin'
Whether or not you was little Joshua
Gosh, I wish I could've told you to not do the same
'Cause one day it could cost you your name

[Chorus]
And this was supposed to be my first single (*burp*)
But I just fucked that up, so
Fuck it, let's all have fun, let's mingle (*burp*)
Slap a bitch and smack a ho
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle (*fart*)
That you hear on your radio
But shit's about to hit the shingle (*fart*)
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-no, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh-oh-ah-ah
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, poo-poo-ka-ka

[Verse 2]
Eri-Eri-Erick swallowed some generic sleeping pills
And woke up in bed next to his best friend Derrick, bare-naked
Jig-a-jig-ji-ji-Janean just turned 16 and used a fake ID
To sneak in V.I.P. to see R. Kelly
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee to be so young and naïve
Oh what I wouldn't give to live so Kim and carefree
Paris and Nicky's parents must be so tickled, they cherish
Every picture with their kids with hickeys all over their necks
Hickory-dickory Dirk Diggler, look at me work wizardry
With these words – am I a jerk or just jerk chicken?
Or chiga-chigga-chig-chig-jer-chig-jer jerkin' your chain
Twenty-two jerks in a jerk circle, or is it a circle jerk?
Wait a minute, what am I sayin'? Allow me to run it back
And rewind it {blblblblblblblb} – wait, let me ask you again
Am I just jerkin' your chain? Am I berserk or insane?
Or am I just one of them damn amateurs workin' the dang
Cameras, filmin' one of them Paris Hilton homemade
Pornos, who keeps tiltin' the lens at an angle
Jigga-ji-just recently somebody just discovered
Britney and Justin videotapes of 'em fuckin'
When they was just Mouseketeers in the Mickey Mouse Club
And dusted 'em and went straight to The Source with 'em
'Cause they could've sworn someone said, "Ni—"
And then tried to erase and record over it
But if you listen close enough to it you can hear the
"Ga-hu" and then they come to
Find out it was Justin sayin', "I'm gon—nuh cum!"

[Chorus]
And this was supposed to be. my first single (*burp*)
But I just fucked that up, so
Fuck it, let's all have fun, let's mingle (*burp*)
Slap a bitch and smack a ho
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle (*fart*)
That you hear on your radio
But shit's about to hit the shingle (*fart*)
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-no, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh-oh-ah-ah
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, poo-poo-ka-ka

[Verse 3]
Any opinions or somethin' you just wanna get off your chest
And address it about my lyrics I'd love to hear it
All you gotta do is pick up the phone and just dial up this number
It's 1-800-I'M-A-DICK-SUCKER-I'D-LOVE-TO-SUCK-A-DICK
And if someone picks up
You can talk all the shit you want about me
Just type in your number back and follow it by the pound key
And I'll be sure to get back as soon as there comes a day
That I fall out with Dre, wake up gay and make up with Ray (hey!)
So fuck a chicken, lick a chicken, suck a chicken, beat a chicken
Eat a chicken like it's a big cock, big-a-big-cock!
Or suck a dick, and lick a dick, and eat a dick, and stick a dick in your mouth
I'm done, you can fuck off, fuck-a-fuck-off!

[Chorus]
And this was supposed to be my first single (*burp*)
But I just fucked that up, so
Fuck it, let's all have fun, let's mingle (*burp*)
Slap a bitch and smack a ho
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle (*fart*)
That you hear on your radio
But shit's about to hit the shingle (*fart*)
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-no, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh-oh-ah-ah
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, poo-poo-ka-ka (*burp*)

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Straight off the streets of chaos and no pity

Can't never leave the crib without a murder wea-pon
Huh, I can't live my life on broke no mo'
And most of these fools ain't shit but cutthroats
They smile in a nigga face, and for what?
They got the game fucked up, and want my thing fucked up

The top notch nigga, I'm fiendin' for that spot
Now peep game on what Six-Deuce told me...

[Verse 3: Six2]
These niggas after yo' paper, Dr. D-R-E (Wha?)
And these punk-ass hoes is lookin' for dough
You gotta watch your homeboys, cause a nigga never know

Bitch niggas, uh-huh

Attention all personnel:

I know yo' type, so much bitch in you, if it was slightly darker
Lights was little dimmer, my dick be stuck up in yo' windpipe
Hmm, you'd rather blow me than fight, I'm from the old school
Like Romey Rome, homey, yo, you owe me the right
To slap you, like the bitch that you are, been wantin' to cap you
Every since you was mad doggin' me with that bitch in yo' car
Fool, "Who do you think you are? Mr. Big Stuff"
Man, you shit on Hitt, get yo' shit bust, plus
Pistol-whipped, cover it up, use yo' bitch's blush
Mr. Powder Puff yo', bark ain't loud enough, huh
I know Chihuahuas that's mo' rah-rah, ha ha
I have to laugh Dre, I bet he take bubble baths
You don't want no trouble with the Aftermath staff, trust me

Must we break you down to estrogen most hated specimens
A bitch nigga

[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G.]
To my motherfuckin man 50 Grand, the alcoholic man
Inject a tall can in his bloodstream if he can
Biggie Smalls, the pussy stroker
MC provoker, chocolate thai smoker, huh?
I like to max in Maximas and Acuras
Your girl buttcheeks I'm smackin', huh?
The raw rapper, spine snapper
With the little hookers on my lap-ah
You know the flavor Mack-ah
A shy nigga but I ain't your fuckin comforter
And if I ever fall in love I bet I'm fuckin her
Ask the hooker, if I didn't jook her
If she tried to front, then I drop the Chuckii Booker on her:
"Why you wanna play your games on me?"
Bitch, you're crazy, commitments, I'm Swayze
No time for the ill shit
Rest with the niggas on that real bloodspill shit
My rappin' tactics are drastic
Stretchin' motherfuckers like Mr. Fantastic
So if you wanna see my pedigre
You better be filled with energy, niggas never gettin' me
So let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down

[Hook: Craig Mack]
Hahhhh, AHHHHHHHH HAH
Let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down

Yo let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down
(Yo, I just wanna get 'em)

[Verse 2: G-Dep]
Yeah, yo
Odds even, said shoot (blaow)
Asked me the reason, and I said loot
Man that's all I'm here for, therefore
When death declares war, you know what to prepare for
Shit, one for shelter, book flights on Delta
Live on your station, the radiation'll melt ya
Cool - I guess your momma raised a fool
You didn't wanna blaze your tool shoulda stayed in school
Rap terror, shots through your new era
Get it together, y'all niggas shoulda knew better
I'm on point like acupuncture
I might, track and hunt ya, smack and punch ya
Left side, right side, witcha ho I might slide
Runnin' wit' this big guy, y'all niggas is pint-size
Don't make a nigga have to show you the pound
And show you the sound, that'll put you low in the ground
Just let me get down

[Hook: Craig Mack]
Let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down
(What? What?)
Let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down

Yo let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down
(Hahh.. I just wanna funk, what? Ahhhh)
Let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down

[Verse 3: Missy Elliott]
I be like: "Whaaaat?" Let me clear my throat
Break the smoke, Missy gotta hit some high notes
Heyy! Yo, from coast to coast I burn like toast
So dope that I floats through snow, nig-guh
Oh, you don't wanna battle me
The agony be like: "Somebody help me, please!"
Feel my pressure, never could a bitch flow better
In any weather, I biddy-bang-bang in ya, nigga
Ah-huh, I used to be the chick to lick the lollipop
Now I pop through your body parts
Blaow, blaow! You like the way I interact
Proceed to smack, any MC that's wack
Ah-huh, microphone check one two
I do ya tool like them freaks run through your crew
Give it to me, ohh, send it to me, ohh
But before I get down, where's my money?
Let me get down

[Hook: Craig Mack]
Let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down
(Hahhh.. boyeee)
Let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down

Yo let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down

[Outro: Notorious B.I.G.]
Bringin' it live to you bitch ass niggas

Who's in the bunker? Who's in the bunker?
Women and children first, and the children first, and the children
I'll laugh until my head comes off
I'll swallow until I burst, until I burst, until I
Who's in the bunker? Who's in the bunker?
I have seen too much, you haven't seen enough, you haven't seen it
I'll laugh until my head comes off
Women and children first, and children first, and children

[Chorus]
Here I'm alive
Everything all of the time

Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming
Let me hear both sides, let me hear both sides, let me hear both
Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming
Throw him in the fire, throw him in the fire, throw him on the

Mobiles skwerking, mobiles chirping
Take the money and run, take the money and run, take the money

[Verse 1]
A green plastic watering can
For a fake Chinese rubber plant
In a fake plastic earth
That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plants
To get rid of itself

[Chorus 1]
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out

[Verse 2]
She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns
He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins

[Chorus 2]
And it wears him out
It wears him out
It wears him out
It wears

[Verse 3]
She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing
My fake plastic love
But I can't help the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling
If I just turn and run

[Chorus 3]
And it wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out

[Outro]
And if I could be who you wanted
If I could be who you wanted
All the time
All the time

I know that we are young, and I know that you may love me
But I just can't be with you like this anymore
Alejandro...

[Verse 1]
She's got both hands in her pocket
And she won't look at you, won't look at you
She hides true love, en su bolsillo
She's got a halo around her finger, around you

[Pre-Chorus]
You know that I love you, boy
Hot, like Mexico, rejoice
At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose

[Chorus]
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Roberto
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro

[Interlude]
Stop, please, just let me go
Alejandro, just let me go

[Verse 2]
She's not broken, she's just a baby
But her boyfriend's like her dad, just like her dad
And all those flames that burned before him
Now he's gotta firefight, gotta cool the bad

[Pre-Chorus]
You know that I love you, boy
Hot, like Mexico, rejoice
At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose

[Chorus]
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Alejandro
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe, Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name, don't call my name, Roberto
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro
Alejandro, Alejandro
Ale-Alejandro, Ale-Alejandro

[Bridge]
Don't bother me, don't bother me
Alejandro
Don't call my name, don't call my name
Bye, Fernando
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe
Alejandro
Don't wanna kiss
Don't wanna touch
Fernando
Don't call my name, don't call my name
Alejandro
I'm not your babe, I'm not your babe
Fernando
Don't wanna kiss, don't wanna touch
Just smoke my cigarette and hush
Don't call my name, don't call my name

It's been a long
A long time coming but I know
Change gonna come

[Verse 1: Charles Hamilton]
Prisoner to my cerebellum
So I reach out to the listeners
And my mission is I better tell 'em
Our fear of a free mind is hearing
Your spirit can die anytime
You need to cry and so you hide it deep inside
Reason why?
How can you change what was written?
Easy, don't focus your brain on what they mentioned
I got so used to tryna make due
I feel like I'm cheating when I'm faced with a break through
The man in the mirror keeps saying I hate you
I respond like lil nigga I made you
Slay those sayin they could break you
So when I take a break I go ape come back and play fool
When they think they won that's when I crush them
Change is eminent I evolve so it's nothing
What's the discussion
Charles Hamilton

[Hook]
It's been a long
A long time coming but I know
Change gonna come

[Verse 2: Asher Roth]
We've been pompous ever since Columbus couldn't work a compass
We've accomplished what we've conjured up while conscious Unconsciously we've conquered all the eye can see
Constantly concocting more options but jobs are still obsolete
It seems so odd to me, an odyssey
How honesty is honestly the rarest thing upon us
It's astonishing
How did all the honest people vanish from the planet?
Leaving us a laundry list of problems to acknowledge
While plotting with my phonics me and Conic and B.o.B
Nag Champa rises as I sit down and sketch my rhymes
Stretch my mind to figure out what's next in line
The next Em, Ye and Andre?
Nah homie its just been a long
A long time coming

[Hook]
It's been a long
A long time coming but I know
Change gonna come

[Verse 3: B.o.B]
Well as you listening to this track
You probably about to blog about it and maybe say its wack
Or maybe compare the verses to see which one of us has snapped
Completely ignoring the fact that this is way more than rap
Cause I happen to be on a magazine you happen to see this issue
Some people wish you well man some people turn against you
Some people even call up to the station just to diss you
You bitch you, you only mad at your self here's a tissue
But that ain't even my focus man that hate ain't on my menu
Im in a different city about to rock a different venue
My girl sent me a text message just to say "i miss you"
It won't be long before I'm home baby but the rent's due
Ha ha ha

[Hook]
It's been a long
A long time coming but I know
Change gonna come

[Verse 1]
Can I, can I save you from you
Cause you know there's something missing
And that champagne you been sipping
Not suppose to make you different all the time
It's starting to feel like the wrong thing to do (yeah)
Cause with all that recognition it gets hard for you to listen
To the things I'mma say to make you mine
But live girl, have some fun girl, we'll be fine
Trying to convince myself I found one
Making a mistake I never learned from

[Hook]
I swear I always fall for your type (yeah)
For your type
Tell me why I always fall for your type (yeah oh uh oh)
For your type
I just can't explain this shit at all (*4X*)
I believe in people like you

[Verse 2]
Cause who am I to judge you on the past girl
I bet there's a reason for it all
You say that you're nothing like the last girl
I just pray that you don't let me down right now
But it's too late, cause I'm already yours
You just gotta promise me, hearts won't break
And end up like before

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Uh look, dress hanging off your shoulder barely sober
Telling me how you moving away and startin over
Girl quit playing you just drunk you just sayin' shit
And you dance, dance all high, like ballet and shit
Oh, wait, no I get it
Girl I’m wit' it
I’ve been down this road before and yeah I skidded but forget it
Damn, damn
I wonder why I never learn my lesson
It's feeling like a second chance and it’s the first impression
And I heard there’s nothing new except for someone new
But how you supposed to find the one when anyone will come with you
Talking to myself but I never listen
Cause man it’s been a while and I swear that this one's different
That’s why I'ma take you anywhere you wanna go
Let you meet my friends so they can lecture me again
About how reckless I have been
And I’m slowly running out of all the time that I invested
Making all the same mistakes
And I’m just trying to correct it, and I fall

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Dear Mrs. Bill Collector
I know you just doing your job
Don’t mean to disrespect you
But we’ve been going through this thing since way back
I told you when I get the dough I would pay back
But I got problems baby yeah if you only knew
I got bigger problems baby, yeah, hey
So why you talking about the money that I owe
Like as if I didn’t know man
It don’t mean nothing to me
Cause right now I got my little boy crying
And my grandmother dying
Could you please stop fucking with me
Listen here, I ain't looking for no tears
But my brother got a year
And my Momma keep smoking that shit
On top of that, I’m broke
Please put that in your notes
For the next one to call me up talking that shit
And then ahana...

[Verse 2]
Hey
Dear, Mr. Policeman
Ay am I wrong, ain't you suppose to keep the peace man?
I coulda swore that I was driving pretty peaceful
So why the hell is you pulling over me fo'?
Is it this black Mercedes?
Oh naw I get it, I get it, I get it
Or cause I’m Black, hmmm maybe?
Yeah, hey, tell me why my hands start sweating
And I hold my breath every time that you get behind me
I turn my music down so you won’t hear a sound
Man I’m nervous like I got a couple pounds on me
You pulled me over, you frown on me
With your flashlight, tell me what do you see
Thug niggas, drug dealers, it's a trip
Every nigga in this whip gotta motherfucking college degree
And then ahana... unh

[Verse 3]
Yeah, my middle finger to the law
I'm busting off, tryna touch the sky
My teacher said impossible but I’mma fucking try
Plus how he gon’ tell me, he don't make the rules
There’s niggas dying every day man we don’t make the news
Instead they talking bout some thunderstorm, cyclones
Timmy got his bike stole
Top story: Tiger Woods be fucking all these White hoes
Anchorman stop snitching
Cut to commercial, he be texting all his side bitches
Hey my goodness, how ironic
On trial for possession of some chronic
My lawyer came to court, man he was higher than a comet
Hey your honor, is you kidding
How you sit above me
Are you perfect motherfucker
How you finna judge me?
When you home you don't cuss, drink and puff like us?
These cops is bad boys, baby just like Puff
They hate they jobs and they days be fucked up like us
At the end of the day you niggas just like us
You niggas just like us

[Segue from "Steve Berman (Skit)"]
...Man, whatever

[Intro]
Dre, just let it run
Ayo, turn the beat up a little bit
Ayo
This song is for anyone
Fuck it, shut up and listen
Ayo

[Verse 1]
I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zag's and this bag
Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this, on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension, dispensin' these sentences
Gettin' this stress that's been eatin' me recently off
Of this chest and I rest again peacefully (Peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter
To not come and speak to me (Speak to me), I don't know you
And no, I don't owe you a motherfuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tempt me, my tank is on empty (Is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you ten feet (Liftin' you ten feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you (Of all you), I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be, it's just me

[Chorus]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, "Oh, it's his lyrical content
The song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses."
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (Finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn (On Marilyn) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at!
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city
Havin' this happenin' (This happenin') then attack
Eminem 'cause I rap this way (Rap this way) but I'm glad
'Cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire to burn
And it's burnin', and I have returned

[Chorus]
And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Verse 3]
I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top a "My Name Is"
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (Got the patience)
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
Who think I'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause I talk
With an accent and grab on my balls so they always
Keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (Fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
'Til I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (Drivin' me crazy), I can't take it
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without
Someone standin' by it! (Standin' by it) No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

[Chorus]
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, that's just the way I am

[Chorus]
Come here, I’m 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighter
You might not be the one but you the one that I desire
Come here, I’m 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighter
You might not be the one

[Verse 1]
Hey, uh
What up girl? Tell me how you feelin’
You look sweet enough to make a nigga need a filling
If you got a man, do that nigga need a fill-in?
She said, "Looks kill and I’m tryna make a killin'"
And God willing, I’d be chilling on the boat nigga
Love is a gamble, I ain’t dealin’ with no broke nigga
Down in Miami with a super ho team
Tryna bag a brother with a Super Bowl ring
Oh, she down in Dallas at the All-Star game
Spittin’ All-Star game
Tryna get a nigga with a all-star name, somethin’ like James
Somethin like Wade, if you something like paid
You can fuck tonight, yeah, she sayin', "Fuck some nice J's
What about your life savings?" Won’t spend her life slavin’
So she graduated, rich nigga wife training
And if you got money, man the head is amazing

[Chorus]
Come here I’m 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighter
You might not be the one but you the one that I desire
Come here I’m 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighter
You might not be the one

[Verse 2]
What up girl? Tell me how you been
Ain’t seen ya since the 12th grade, even back then
Thought you was a cutie, though your booty mad thin
But you done got thick on a nigga, goddamn
Hey now, I got a thing for you
It's been a long time comin', I should hang with you
'Cause see way back, I thought to fuck with you was impossible
Count your baby daddy’s now, two and a possible
Uh, you still got it though, yeah, you still got it though
Girl your body lookin’ like a fuckin’ pot of gold
You got your mean little walk with the model pose
You got your hair did, you got designer clothes
You still got it though, yeah, you still got it though
You got your nails did, damn girl, you're on a roll
Do you get brains? Did you make the honor roll?
Don’t worry bout your man baby, he ain’t gotta know

[Chorus]
Come here, I’m 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighter
You might not be the one but you the one that I desire
Come here, I’m 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighter
You might not be the one

[Verse 3]
Hey, I get bored so fast that they won’t last
But girl you’re special like I met you in the slow class
'Cause yo ass got me fiending for ya so far
My life is like a movie, would you be my co-star?
Like Halle Berry? Your old nigga act like a bitch, like Tyler Perry
You caught him down in Memphis cheating like Calipari
I see you like to stay up on your ESPN
If your mind is on sex, you must got ESP then
Had a crush on way back, I wasn’t VIP then
But I was plotting on you, I really wish that I'd have got to know you
Before we grew up and I blew up with these Benjamins
That way I know for sure your love is really genuine
Is you my homie? Well show me what kind of friend you is
What if it's phony? Yeah only 'cause I can give you ends
Too late for turning back, fuck it, we continuing
Get your ass in that position I love to bend you in

[Chorus]
Come here, I'm 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighter
You might not be the one but you the one that I desire
Come here, I'm 'bout to take you higher
We about to set this bitch on fire
Pour a little gas, spark up your lighter
You might not be the one

[Intro]
Da-da, da-da
Yo, I can't sing, but
I feel like singing
I wanna fuckin' sing
'Cause I'm happy
Yeah, I'm happy
I got my baby back
Yo, check it out

[Verse 1]
Some days I sit starin' out the window
Watchin' this world pass me by
Sometimes I think there's nothin' to live for
I almost break down and cry
Sometimes I think I'm crazy
I'm crazy, oh, so crazy
Why am I here? Am I just wastin' my time?
But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no

[Chorus 1]
'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
(Fuck, I was scared)
Everyone's leanin' on me
‘Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me

[Verse 2]
My baby girl keeps gettin' older
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes ‘cause they don't understand me
They just don't see my real side
I act like shit don't faze me
Inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive
But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no

[Chorus 1]
‘Cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
‘Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me

[Verse 3]
Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin' as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't *reh tnaw*
Now, you probably get this picture from my public persona
That I'm a pistol-packin' drug addict who bags on his momma
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
‘Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside of
My soul and just know that I grow colder the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world
And I think my neck is breakin'
Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations?
Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else
But the years that I've wasted is nothin' to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what I'm facin': three felonies, six years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman
I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to people's backs
Bent over backwards for this woman
Man, I shoulda seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in?
Wouldn't have ripped the prenup up if I'da seen what she was fuckin'
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, maybe, the only lady that I adore
Hailie! So sayonara, try tomorrow, nice to know ya
Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been lifted
And—

[Chorus 2]
Now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cause my baby knows that her daddy's a soldier
Nothin' can take her from me

[Outro]
Wooo! Told you I can't sing
Oh, well—I tried
Hailie, 'member when I said
If you ever need anything, Daddy would be right there?
Guess what—Daddy's here
And I ain't goin' nowhere, baby
I love you (​​*smooch*)​​

[Intro: Doctor & Nurse]
Scalpel
Here
Sponge
Here
Wait, he's convulsing, he's convulsing
Ahh
We're gonna have to shock him
Oh my God, oh my God
We're gonna have to shock him
Oh my God

[Verse 1]
These are the results of a thousand electric volts
A neck with bolts
Nurse, we're losin' him, check the pulse
A kid who refused to respect adults
Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose
A corny-lookin' white boy, scrawny and always ornery
'Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies pickin' on me
And I might snap, one day just like that
I decided to strike back, and flatten every tire on the bike rack
My first day in Junior High, this kid said
"It's you and I, three o'clock sharp, this afternoon you die"
I looked at my watch, it was 1:20
"I already gave you my lunch money
What more do you want from me?"
He said, "Don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse"
My palms were sweaty, and I started to shake at first
Somethin' told me, "Try to fake a stomach ache, it works"
I screamed, "Ow, my appendix feel like they could burst
Teacher, teacher, quick, I need a naked nurse"
"What's the matter?"
"I don't know, my leg, it hurts"
"Leg? I thought you said it was your tummy"
"Oh, I mean it is, but I also got a bum knee"
"Mr. Mathers, the fun and games are over
And just for that stunt, you're gonna get some extra homework"
"But don't you wanna give me after school detention?"
"Nah, that bully wants to beat your ass and I'ma let him"

[Chorus]
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go, they keep playin' my song
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go, they keep playin' my song
Brain damage

[Verse 2]
Way before my baby daughter Hailie
I was harassed daily by this fat kid named DeAngelo Bailey
An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, 'cause his father boxes
So every day he'd shove me in the lockers
One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin'
And had me in the position to beat me into submission
He banged my head against the urinal 'til he broke my nose
Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat
I tried to plead and tell him we shouldn't beef
But he just wouldn't leave
He kept chokin' me and I couldn't breathe
He looked at me and said, "You gonna die, honky"
The principal walked in and started helpin' him stomp me
(What's going on in here?)
I made 'em think they beat me to death
Holdin' my breath for like five minutes before they finally left
Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth
Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four-inch screws
Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms and foreign tools
This is for every time you took my orange juice
Or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk
Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt
I'm gettin' you back, bully, now once and for good
I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could
And beat him over the head with it 'til I broke the wood
Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot
Made it home later that same day
Started readin' a comic, and suddenly everything became gray
I couldn't even see what I was tryin' to read
I went deaf and my left ear started to bleed
My mother started screamin', "What are you on, drugs?!
Look at you, you're gettin' blood all over my rug" (I'm sorry)
She beat me over the head with the remote control
Opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull
I picked it up and screamed, "Look, bitch, what have you done?"
"Oh my God, I'm sorry, son"
Shut up, you cunt
I said fuck it, took it and stuck it back up in my head
Then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck

[Chorus]
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go, they keep playin' my song
Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin'
But everywhere I go, they keep playin' my song

[Outro]
Brain damage, it's brain damage
I got brain damage, it's brain damage
It's probably brain damage, it's brain damage
Brain damage, I got brain damage

[Intro: Kanye West]
Uh
Uh
I love it, though
I love it, though, huh, you know?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Uh, put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preachin' to the congregation
We love Jesus, but you done learned a lot from Satan
I mean, a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married, but tonight I need some consummation

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
May the Lord forgive us, may the gods be with us
In that magic hour, I seen good Christians
Make brash decisions, oh, she do it
What happened to religion? Oh, she lose it
She putting on her makeup, she casually allure
Text message break-ups, the casualty of tour
How she gon' wake up and not love me no more?
I thought I was the asshole, I guess it's rubbin' off
Hood phenomenon, the LeBron of rhyme
Hard to be humble when you stunting on a jumbotron
I'm looking at her like, "This what you really wanted, huh?"
Why we argue anyway? Oh, I forgot, it's summertime

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
I know I'm preachin' to the congregation
We love Jesus, but she done learned a lot from Satan
Satan, Satan, Satan
I mean, a nigga did a lot of waiting
We ain't married, but tonight I need some consummation

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
When the sun go down, it's the magic hour, the magic hour
And outta all the colors that'll fill up the skies
You got green on your mind, I can see it in your eyes
Why you standing there with your face screwed up?
Don't leave while you're hot, that's how Mase screwed up
Throwin' shit around, the whole place screwed up
Maybe I should call Mase so he could pray for us
I hit the Jamaican spot, at the bar, take a seat
I ordered the jerk, she said you are what you eat
You see, I always loved that sense of humor
But tonight, you should have seen how quiet the room was
The Lyor Cohen of Dior Homme
That's "Dior Homme," not "Dior, homie"
The crib Scarface, could it be more Tony?
You love me for me, could you be more phony?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Put your hands to the constellations
The way you look should be a sin, you my sensation
Haven't said a word, haven't said a word to me this evening
Cat got your tongue?

[Instrumental Interlude: Mike Dean Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Lookin' at my bitch, I bet she give your ass a bone
Lookin' at my wrist, it'll turn your ass to stone
Stretch limousine, sipping rosé all alone
Double-headed monster with a mind of his own
Cherry-red chariot, excess is just my character
All-black tux, nigga's shoes lavender
I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders
Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired (Uh)
Before his jaw shattered, climbing up the Lord's ladder
We still speedin', running signs like they don't matter, uh
Hater talkin' never made me mad
Never that, not when I'm in my favorite paper tag
Therefore, G4s at the Clearport
When it come to tools, fool, I'm a Pep Boy
When it came to dope, I was quick to export
Never tired of ballin', so it's on to the next sport
New Mercedes sedan, the Lex' sport
So many cars, DMV thought it was mail fraud
Different traps I was gettin' mail from
Polk County, Jacksonville, right in Melbourne
Whole clique appetites had tapeworms
Spinnin' Teddy Pendergrass vinyl as my J burns
I shed a tear before the night's over
God bless the man I put this ice over (Uh)
Getting 2Pac money twice over
Still a real nigga, red Coogi sweater, dice-roller
I'm makin' love to the angel of death
Catchin' feelings, never stumble, retracin' my steps (Uh)
Uh

[Verse 1: will.i.am]

I put it down from the whip to my diamonds, I'm in
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow

Uh, black stripe, yellow paint
Them niggas scared of it, but them hoes ain't
Soon as I hit the club, look at them hoes' face
Hit the pedal once, make the floor shake
Suede inside, my engine roarin'
It’s the big boy, you know what I paid for it
And I got the pedal to the metal
Got you niggas checking game, I’m ballin' out on every level
Hear them haters talk, but there’s nothin' you can tell 'em
Just made a million, got another million on my schedule
No love for 'em, nigga breaking hearts
No keys, push to start

[Chorus]
Yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, yeah, I do it big
Yeah, uh-huh, screaming: "That's nothin'!"
When I pulled off the lot, that's stuntin'
Reppin' my town, when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds, I'm in
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow

[Verse 2]
Got a call from my jeweler, this just in
And bitches love me ‘cause I'm fucking with their best friends
Not a lesbian, but she a freak though
This ain't for one night, I’m shining all week, ho
I’m sippin' Clicquot and rocking yellow diamonds
So many rocks up in my watch I can’t tell what the time is
Got a pocket full of big faces
Throw it up, 'cause every nigga that I’m with Taylor'd

[Chorus]
Yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, yeah, I do it big
Yeah, uh-huh, screaming: "That's nothin'!"
When I pulled off the lot, that's stuntin'
Reppin' my town, when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds, I'm in
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow

[Verse 3]
Stay high like how I’m supposed to do
That crowd underneath them clouds can’t get close to you
And my car look unapproachable
Super clean, but it's super mean
She wanna fuck with them cats, smoke weed, count stacks
Get fly and take trips and that's that, real rap
I let her get high if she want and she feel that
Convertible drop feel, ‘87, the top peeled back

[Bridge]
Yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is
You already know what it is, man
And if you don't, you should by now
Reppin' my town, when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds, I'm in
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow

[Chorus]
Yeah, uh-huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, yeah, I do it big
Yeah, uh-huh, screaming: "That's nothin'!"
When I pulled off the lot, that's stuntin'
Reppin' my town, when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds, I'm in
Black and yellow, black and yellow
Black and yellow, black and yellow

[Chorus]
Well, it was just a dream, just a moment ago
I was up so high, lookin' down at the sky, don't let me fall
I was shootin' for stars, on a Saturday night
They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall
Don't let me fall, don't let me fall
They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall
Don't let me fall

[Verse 1]
'Cause I'm glidin' up there, oh so very high that if the
Clouds were to drop me then I'd, fall out the sky, I don't really
Know why I'm here, I guess I'm, just here for the ride, I swear it
Feels like I'm dreamin', it's vividly defined, yeah
So call me whatever you want, title me whatever you like
But let's get one thing straight, you know my name
So I run this town, when I'm on this mic, yeah
So here I go, B.o.B, Bobby Ray, I don't know, need I know
But I know, that I flow, rack 'em up, knock 'em down, dominoes
Then I go, as my story goes
I know I've done been down here before
Product of my East Decatur home
'Cause I was in the cold, tryna keep my toes unfroze
Now I'm in your house, now I'm in your soul
Now I'm everywhere that your iPod go
Everything I seen was a dream just a moment ago

[Chorus]
Well, it was just a dream, just a moment ago
I was up so high, lookin' down at the sky, don't let me fall
I was shootin' for stars, on a Saturday night
They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall
Don't let me fall, don't let me fall
They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall
Don't let me fall, don't let me fall
They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall
Don't let me fall

[Verse 2]
Yeah, well I'm from much lower than where that pavement is
'Cause there ain't no parachute that they can make for this
'Cause I put my pain, my heart, my soul, my faith in this
Does anyone feel like how I feel? Then you can relate to this
Or just blaze to this, maybe roll one up, then take a hit
Toast to the good life then take a sip
Vacay everyday, yeah take a trip
It's easy to see I was made for this
From the womb all the way to the grave I spit
Just to show y'all niggas what greatness is, yeah
I'm talkin' very lucid, like makin' movies
To picture my life boy, you need a higher resolution
I used to cut class in the day, then run away at night
But now I'm ruler of the upper class and I don't even write

[Chorus]
Well, it was just a dream, just a moment ago
I was up so high, lookin' down at the sky, don't let me fall
I was shootin' for stars, on a Saturday night
They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall
Don't let me fall, don't let me fall
They say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall
Don't let me fall

[Verse]
I got ice all over my windshield
I can tell it's gon' be a cold winter
I hit the defrost, I never turn the heat off
And still I'm so chilly willy snowflake
These silly billies really fail to act as if they know Drake
Always gossipin' callin' and textin'
Magneto niggas tryna bring down ex-men
Tellin' my ex-girl tryin' to explain
How I am no good, so go with the next man, but dog
You don't know me, you don't know us
We go by the name of A-T-F, and any previous affiliation
They know to hold they tongue and I spare 'em humiliation
I know you in and out, nigga I am not playin'
Just fall back, keep on Escape'in and Alize'in
And stop tryna act like you like me and my team
Not us, so you knock us, that's precisely what I mean
And dog, it's forever clear, my money evergreen
My presence required in places you have never been
It's all in a day's work, that's what I am on
NBC, MTV, Viacom
And whose Continental GT is outside
Showin' them how monumental he be?
One wheel on the curb, ticket on the dash
It's like every fuckin' summer I just switch it on they ass
And maaan I'm a commodity, none of them as hot as me
The industry standard, so I am what they gotta be
Cause Drake's syllables is like Jake Gyllenhaal
Can't help it, I been brainwashed to kill 'em all
I think I should pass my own amendment
You frontin' with glass all in your pendant
You ain't livin', rapper, you never have been
You a has-been, a gas station attendant
Your man is a turkey, you wit' a liar
I'm clearin' the air, I'm a humidifier
I'm spittin' fire, and gettin' flyer
And what you plannin' for this summer, I did it prior
I've shattered shows in tattered clothes
Met status quos, this is the South
And I am, present when it matters most
The startin's hot but pay attention to my latter flows
Givin' brain ain't bad girl, don't be that opposed
I flatter hoes
And drink Dom, they always ask me, "Is that a rose?"
"You mean Rosé? Why yes it is"
I stopped trying years ago, this is effortless
I'm in your house got the key to your home
I am Jeopardy asked Wikipedia known
I am A.A. driven and Expedia flown
So stop jackin' my style, you're in need of ya own, man

[Intro]
(Coast to Coast Instrumentals)
I don't know what the hell that is
Should have just called Puff for the fucking instrumental
Fuck it, no time for that boy!
Cole World

[Verse 1]
They say we living in troubled times
Aye, do you see the trouble signs?
Aye, lifes a bitch, and I'm cuffing mines
My dough in flipmode, what up to Busta Rhymes
I used to never see green, I was colorblind
Now I get my hustle on
Pay dues like a hair salon
My way like a Usher song
Higher power where these verses from
You niggas hoes, put your purses on
Church, get your worship on
Born alone, work alone, die alone
Hot fire like Dylan
Bitches get their dial on
Fake niggas get dial tones
I ain't no Viacom nigga
I'm a fire arm, nigga
Look how I alarm niggas
Watch my dope pile on
'Til it's like a mile long
Niggas couldn't fill my shoes
Couldn't even try 'em on
Showed your lil' ass look
That's how you take it
Two-facing niggas, couldn't tie my shoe laces, boy!

[Verse 2]
That was the warm up, this is the blow up
Now if you ain't talking no bread boy, ain't no need to show up
Man they say I'm repping the Ville too much, but fuck it, so what?
When my niggas carrying toys like they don't wanna grow up
When my sisters drinking like fishes and won't even throw up
Let's po' up, get to' up, know the police gon' show up
I slow up
Some niggas ain't got no luck
Some niggas can't get no love
Some of 'em can't get no bucks
So tell me what do a nigga do if he can't get a job?
My brother got him an interview, but he can't get a ride
What's up God?
No this ain't no Wu-Tang shit
This is my lil' fire drill, just some routine shit
Just to shoot fiends with
And hold 'em off a lil' longer
Every verse I write I swear I'm only getting stronger
Can you ponder?
Imagine what my shit gon' sound like
If I told you that The Warm Up was just a sound bite
Damn right, believe I put it down right
And I'll be sure to tell you lil' niggas what that crown like
I showed you love, I brought you through
I gave you pounds right?
Aye, in my face, you knew your place
And so you smile right?
So why I'm here, and now you talking like a little girl?
You sound like Whitley, nigga
Me? I'm from a different world
Your shit is garbage
If I drop you, I'm a litterbug
Busy getting money
I ain't fucking with that Twitter, girl
Fuck what they say, wishing me harm and sorrow
They here today, bet they be gone tomorrow
They catching Z's on me, aye we gon' call 'em Zorro
I'll let you sleep today, but it's on tomorrow
Yeah, I said it's on tomorrow
I'm coming for the game
And I ain't talking loan or borrow
Pray for the days I get cash, checks and never weary
This the last stretch, I'm a half step from legendary

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Open up your hearts, people
Page one, chapter one, verse motherfucking one
Yeah, uh-huh
I'm drinking hot tea, bitch
Feel me

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, now if you let me, you won't regret me
Shit, if you let me, you won't forget me
Remember? And if you don't then ponder
Hold up, bow! bow! there's a reminder
I ain't kinda hot, I'm sauna
I sweat money, and the bank is my shower
Haha, and that pistol is my towel
Haha, so stop sweating me, coward
And I would die for ours
Ride for hours, supply the flowers
This is history in the making
Now shut the fuck up and let me make it

[Chorus: D. Smith & Lil Wayne]
Please don't shoot me down, 'cause I'm flying
I'm flying, I'm higher
Please don't shoot me down
'Cause I'm flying, I'm higher
I swear this tea is at a real good temperature right now
So am I, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I spit Alcatraz bars, I know
And D-boys is the only Alphabet Boys I know
Got a .380 on my waist and Rambo back home
No more bandana 'round my dome, bandana in my right pocket
Bitch, I'm grown, fuck what you on
Now, watch me stand on the world as I sit in a throne
And if I jump, I'ma fly and look into the eagle's eye
And see, I am nothing like you, why?
Bitch, see, it gets me how nothing gets me or get to me
And if you shootin' for the stars, then just shoot me
But your bullets don't reach Mars
Paws, claws, because I'm a beast, I'm a dog
I'll get you, my picture should be in the dictionary
Next to the definition of "Definition"
Because repetition is the father of learnin'
And son, I know your barrel burnin', but—

[Chorus: D. Smith]
Please don't shoot me down, 'cause I'm flying
I'm flying, I'm higher
Please don't shoot me down
'Cause I'm flying, I'm higher
Ayy, I'ma talk to my daddy

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Papa, I did it to 'em! I'm a bastard!
And I'ma do it again, like "nigga" backwards
These niggas backwards, but they behind us
Now, watch me get high, like, time's up
Nah, D., bring the drums back
And watch me hit 'em where they lungs at, like that
I get respect 'cause if I don't, I'ma take it
I see your boys hating, and I see your girls naked
Drum, sound like a naked gun, switch clips with my thumb
Then, I pop another clip in and aim at his vision
'Cause Wayne is his vision, 'cause Wayne is the mission
I'm aiming at a mirror

[Chorus: D. Smith & Lil Wayne]
Please don't shoot me down, 'cause I'm flying
I'm flying, I'm higher
And I've done it before
Please don't make me do it no more
Please don't shoot me down
'Cause I'm flying, I'm higher
Watch me soar
Where the fuck is my guitar? Now roar
Ohhhhhhhhhh
Please don't shoot me down, 'cause I'm flying
I'm flying, I'm higher

I'm killing these bitches, Young Wayne Carruth (Kill 'em, Wayne)
Untamed and loose; blunts, drank and juice
I was once a spark; into a flame, it grew
I don't complain to you—don't complain to me
Everbody got beef, and I just came to eat
I'm in the game for keeps; if you in my lane, I beep (Ugh)
I been running this shit, and I never sprained my knee
And guess who came home? Ronnie the O.G. (Yeah)

OK, light brown, Southern-tan Medina (Ugh, ugh)
With a light-brown, thick thing like Trina (Yeah, haha)
Um, you prolly seen us (Uh-huh, yeah)

[Intro]
So, Lil Wayne, what's your motivation?
Is that really a question? (Yeah, shawty)
Do you really have that written down in your notepad? (You already)
You should be ashamed of yourself (C2)
You smell me, girl, I smell like money (Why not? What's better?)
See, that's what they don't understand (Not a goddamn thing)
To me, it was always get money or die (Yeah)
I come up under Birdman, the Number One Stunna, you know what I mean?
I'm Stunna Jr. (Yeah), and that's all I know, that's all I ever knew
Get money or get nothing, you know what I'm saying? (I feel)
And I feel that way (I feel it), for real

[Verse 1]
So hard I go, I keep pushing (Yeah)
The game so crazy, I'm in it like deep pussy (Yeah)

Used to make a thousand dollars every time I played hooky (Yeah)
Dwayne Carter absent, keep lookin' (Bitch)
I'm present on the block, I'm a legend on the block (Yeah)
Ice so bright like heaven on the watch (Yeah)
Yeah, nigga, I done dropped one-eleven on the watch (Uh)
So watch and see what I do (Yeah, yeah)
Breeze by you so fast, got you sneezin', hachoo

Weezy F Baby, now the F is for FEMA
Sick nigga, bitch, I spit that leukemia (Bitch)
Yeah, no cure, no help
So me, so good, so hard, so felt
Feel me

[Interlude]
And that's just my point right there
That's what I'm always trying to stress, know what I'm saying?
If you don't understand me, if you don't feel me, then you ain't real
In my eyes, and that's all that count to me, you know?
So, is your music considered the voice of urban America or America period?
I mean, I would say the voice of the hood 'cause that's who I speak for
And myself, you know what I mean? My family, that's who I represent
My homies (Yeah), my girl, my life, you know?

[Verse 2]
C'mon, bang this shit, nigga, pump my shit (Yeah)
You gotta bang that wimp and go and dump that bitch (Yeah)
You gotta claim that strip and go and flood that bitch (Yeah)
You gotta aim that shit and straight bust that shit
Like motherfuck them niggas, what they wan' do? I'm ready
Tevin Campbell, no homo, black Rambo (Yeah, yeah)
Fuckin' with the boy, baby, that's a gamble  (Yeah)
If he won in Vegas, leave him on the crap table (Come on)
I'm willing and I'm able to come run up in your stable (Yeah)
Like nobody make a sound, where the paper? Where the paper?
Gotta get it, gotta have it (Yeah), once I got it, I'ma spend it (Yeah)
Then it's back to doing any damn thing just to get it (Yeah)
The re-ups be like birthday parties (Huh?)
No room to park the cars in the garages (Huh?)
So outside the cribs, all you see is 'Erraris
If I ain't say it right, fuck it, I ain't foreign
Feel me

[Interlude]
And see, that's where everybody gettin' me wrong at, you know what I mean?
I got that heat rock, for real
Why do you think other rappers lack the impact of your music?
That's because they ain't got that heat rock like me, you know what I mean?
They ain't spitting like me
They spitting, but, know what I mean, they ain't got colds
I got the flu over here, man (Yeah), for real
I need relief
Y'all help me, for real (Yeah)
I know y'all sick of me, 'cause I'm tired of y'all, for real

[Verse 3]
And based on the bank, I'm doin' much better than a lot of these niggas
I'm tired of these niggas
Yawnin' when I see 'em, make me stretch and pull the burner (Yeah)
I'm cockin' back and passin'
They catch 'em in they sternum
Ooh-ooh, that gon' probably burn ya (Yeah)
That gon' probably learn ya (Yeah)
To never, ever, ever (What?)
Ever, ever, ever come around here no more
Rich gangsters over here, you gotta die with the broke bitch
I'm the god, I should ride with the Pope
But the boy so hood, I just ride with my ho (Yeah)
Yeah, and tell her 'bout Hollygrove
Tell her 'bout my last show, tell her 'bout my last ho
You know, just born to mack
Call me Deion Sanders, bring the corner back, yeah
I'm in my prime, niggas falling back (Okay)
That's right, I'm coming, baby, yeah, hard as crack
Feel me

[Outro]
And that's just what it is, nigga (Yeah)
If you don't like my shit, then fuck you and your shit, man, straight up
That's how I was taught, that's how I was brought up, and that's how I'ma go down, man, for real
Cash Money Young Money in your motherfuckin' throat, bitch

[Intro: B.o.B]
Hi, my name is B.o.B, and I approve this message

[Hook: Rivers Cuomo]
I got the magic in me
Every time I touch that track it turns into gold
Everybody knows I got the magic in me

Now everybody wants some presto magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Ahooooooo, I got the magic in me

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
These tricks that I'll attempt will blow your mind
Pick a verse, any verse, I'll hypnotize you with every line (Ah!)
I'll need a volunteer, how about you, with the eyes? (Right there)
Come on down to the front and stand right here and don't be shy (Bobby)
I'll have you time travellin', have your mind babblin'
People tryin' to inherit the skill, so they askin' me
Even David Blaine had to go and take some classes and
I see Mindfreak like "What's up man, what's happenin'?" (Mindfreak!)
So come one, come all, and see the show tonight (Ha)
Prepare to be astounded, no ghost or poltergeist
You know I'm no Pinocchio, I never told a lie
So call me Mr. Magic Man, I float on Cloud 9, haha

[Hook: Rivers Cuomo & B.o.B]
I got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
Every time I touch that track it turns into gold (Yes, it turns to gold)
Everybody knows I got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)

Now everybody wants some presto magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Ahooooooo, I got the magic in me

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
We'll take a journey into my mind, you'll see why it's venom I rhyme
Stay on the road, so I call my mama when I got time
I hit the stage, go insane, then jump into that crowd (Ah)
See, see, when I rhyme, I flow on the beat like pitta-da-da
See, I deceive ya with my intergalactic ether (Yeah)
I sing just like Aretha, so respect me like I'm Caesar
I kick it like Adidas, flowin' sticky like adhesive
Be cautious, 'cause what I be on'll leave ya with amnesia
I break all the rules like Evel Knievel (Yeah!)
It's a spectacular show, 'cause my heart pumps diesel
So whatever you sayin', it don't entertain my ego
I do this everyday, Hocus Pocus is my steelo

[Hook: Rivers Cuomo & B.o.B]
I got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
Every time I touch that track it turns into gold (Yes, it turns to gold)
Everybody knows I got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
When I hit the floor, the girls come snappin' at me (They be snappin', baby)
Now everybody wants some presto magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Ahooooooo, I got the magic in me

[Outro: B.o.B, B.o.b & Rivers Cuomo]
Ayy, that, that, I got that
Ayy, I got the magic in me
Ah-ha-ha
I, I, I, I, I got the magic in me

[Intro]
Yeah, it's my life
In my own words, I guess

[Verse 1]
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for
When they know they're your heart and you know you are their armor
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
"Daddy, look what I made!" "Dad's gotta go catch a plane"
"Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?"
"I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy
Daddy's writin' a song, this song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog, then you gotta swing by yourself"
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rock-a-bye baby, ha

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

[Verse 2]
I keep havin' this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screamin' she don't want me to sing
"You're makin' Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?"
"Baby, Daddy ain't leavin' no more" "Daddy, you're lyin'!
You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leavin' no more, Daddy, you're mine!"
She's pilin' boxes in front of the door, tryna block it
"Daddy, please! Daddy, don't leave! Daddy, no, stop it!"
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, "This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it wit' ya!"
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talkin' 'cause, man, I can hear 'em
They're sayin', "You got one more chance to do right and it's tonight
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em 'fore it's too late."
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone and the spotlight is on and I'm singin'

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

[Verse 3]
Sixty-thousand people all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet
I take a bow and "Thank you all for comin' out"
They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein'
"Daddy, it's me! Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'!"
"But baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?"
"I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
You lied to me, Dad, and now you made Mommy sad
And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
That's all I wanted, I just wanna give you this coin
I get the point, fine, me and Mommy are goin'."
"But baby, wait!" – "It's too late, Dad, you made the choice
Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep
Screamin' your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill, yeah, I bet you you will
You rap about it, yeah, word, kid, keep it real."
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be that the curtain is closin' on me?
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream, "Die, Shady!" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was
Supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister, almost as if to say

[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smilin'
And I didn't feel a thing
So, baby, don't feel my pain, just smile back

*Curtains closing*

[Intro]
I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why shouldn't it be true?
I get a kick out of brew

[Verse]
There's only one beer left
Rappers screaming all in our ears like we're deaf
Tempt me, do a number on the label
Eat up all they emcees and drink 'em under the table
Like, "It's on me—put it on my tab, kid"
However you get there, foot it, cab it, iron horse it
You're leaving on your face, forfeit
I crush the mic, hold it like the heat, he might toss it
Told him tell 'em they stole it, he told her he lost it
She told him, "Get off it," and a bunch of other more shit
Getting money, DT's be getting no new leads
It's like he eating watermelon, stay spitting new seeds
It's the weed, give me some of what he drooping off
Soon as he wake up, choking like it was whooping cough
They group been soft
First hour at the open bar and they're trooping off
He went to go laugh and get some head by the side road
She asked him autograph her derriere, it read:
"To Wide Load, this yard bird taste like fried toad turd
Love, Villain" — take pride in code words
Crooked eye, mold, nerd, geek with a cold heart
Probably still be speaking in rhymes as an old fart
Study how to eat to die by the pizza guy
No, he's not too fly to skeet in a skeezer eye
And squeeze her thigh, maybe give her curves a feel
The same way she feel it when he flow with nerves of steel
They call the super when they need their back, uh, plumbing fixed
"How is only one left? The pack comes in six!
Whatever happened to two and three?"
A herb tried to slide with four and five
And got caught like, "What you doing, G?"
Don't make 'em have to get cutting like truancy
Matter fact, not for nothing, right now, you and me!"
Looser than a pair of Adidas
I hope you brought your spare tweeters
MCs sound like cheerleaders
Rapping and dancing like Red Head Kingpin
DOOM came to do the thing again, no matter who be blingin'
He do it for the smelly hubbies
Seeds know what time it is like it's time for Teletubbies
Few can do it, even fewer can sell it
Take it from the dude who wear a mask like a 'tarded helmet
He plots shows like robberies
In and out — one, two, three — no bodies, please
Run the cash and you won't get a wet sweatshirt
The mic is the shotty: nobody move, nobody get hurt
Bring heat like the boy done gone to war
He came in the door, and "Everybody on the floor!"
A whole string of jobs like we on tour
Every night on the score, coming to your corner store

[Skit 1]
There, it is done
Now that the representative from South Africa has been
Mind programmed
All of the world leaders on earth are under my control
And when they meet tomorrow in special session
I, DOOM, shall be voted: Master of the World
My plan is foolproof, but just in case
And what about snow?

[Outro: Skit 2]
Now you keep your eyes open
When I tell ya, start snappin' (Oh yeah, sure)
Uh, ladies und gentlemen
I am risking my life to tell you with, with great concern
That I must warn you, I, I
You must listen
Many among you, have, have had their minds taken over
(What a story, start snappin’)
DOOM, gosh, I wish I’d brought my autograph book
(Your attempts at humor bore me) Right, lead-head
You’re weird
Why is everyone staring at us?
(Aw, I should have realized, we must look like freaks to them)
Relax masseur, just do your thing
(Get a good grip on my—)
What? Why, I’ll bend your read-out meter for ya, you little
(Hey, knock it off, Ben)
What’s the matter? (Oh, Ben)
You’re nothing but a chicken-head
(You overgrown granite-head) Hold it

[Intro - Swizz Beatz]
I need everybody to report to the dance floor right now
The world is very different now
You know why
It's Gucci time

[Verse 1 - Gucci Mane]
Big Gucci, trap boys call me Brick Gucci
Dime piece, time piece got my Swiss moving
Swiss cheese out a hater if he act foolish
Swizz Beats Gucci Mane call it trap music
I think I need an ESPY, these rappers best respect me
They try to Ron Artest me, they gonna have to arrest me
With a doubt I bring 'em out
The kid is all she think about
She cheated with La Flare but its nothing to spill a drink about
Do you know what time it is
Gucci Time
15 past the diamond, bitch
I'm hood rich wealthy and all that there
All time 

[?] have no idea
It's Gucci time

[Hook - Gucci Mane]
Cut the lights on, cut these fucking lights on
All this ice on no need to cut the lights on
It's Gucci time!

[X4]

[Verse 2 - Gucci Mane]
Came in dranking rolling up stanking
White boy wasted frat house wasted
Amazing like my bracelet I'm flossing
R.I.P. the Mike the ice got my chest moon walking
Cabbage patching bouncing like Bankhead
Pull up in the drop top Ferrari on Bankhead
Colder than a polar bear sleeping in the freezer
She wish she never met me wanna catch amnesia
Gucci Mane crazy I might pull up on a zebra
Land on top a eagle smoke a joint of reefa
Standing on the sofa spilling liquor on the speaker
Call the paralegal cause this shit should be illegal

[Hook]

[Swizz Beatz]
Keep tocking a tocking to keep ticking
Ya Rollie ain't real if the bitch keep ticking
A hundred thou on the shoe and socks ain't nothing
A hundred thou on the wristband ain't nothing 

[X2]

[Hook]

[Intro: Sade, MF DOOM]
Mic Check
When I was led to you
I knew you were the one for me
Come through, dig the sound
I swear the whole world could feel you MC
Crowd around

[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
I used to cop a lot, but never copped no drop
Hold mics like pony tails tight and bob a lot
Stop and stick around, come through and dig the sound
Of the fly brown 6-0 sicko psycho who throws his dick around
Bound to go three-plat, came to destroy rap
It's a intricate plot of a b-boy strapped
Femstat cats get kidnapped
Then release a statement to the press, let the rest know who did that
Metal Fist terrorists claim responsibility
Broken household name usually said in hostility
Um... what is MF? You silly
I'd like to take "Mens to the End" for two milli'
"Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!" That's a audio daily double
Rappers need to fall off just to save me the trouble, yo
Watch your own back came in and go out alone, black
Stay in the zone—turn H2O to Cognac

[Chorus: MF DOOM]
On Doomsday, ever since the womb
‘Til I'm back where my brother went, that's what my tomb will say
Right above my government; Dumile
Either unmarked or engraved, hey, who's to say?

[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
I wrote this one in B.C. D.C. O-section
If you don't believe me, go get bagged and check then
Cell number seventeen, up under the top bunk
I say this not to be mean, wish bad luck or pop junk
Pop the trunk on Cee Cipher Punk, leave him left scraped
God forbid, if there ain't no escape, blame MF tape
Definition "super-villain": a killer who love children
One who is well-skilled in destruction, as well as building
While Sidney Sheldon teaches the trife to be trifer
I'm trading science fiction with my man the live lifer
A pied piper holler a rhyme, a dollar and a dime
Do his thing, ring around the white collar crime
Get out my face, askin' ‘bout my case, need toothpaste
Fresher mint, monkey-style nigga get mentadent
And dope fiends still in they teens, shook niggas turn witness
Real mens mind their own business
That's the difference between sissy-pissy rappers that's double-dutch
How come I hold the microphone double-clutch
C.O.'s make rounds, never have ‘ox found
On shakedown, lock-down, wet dreams of Fox' Brown

[Chorus: MF DOOM]
On Doomsday!, ever since the womb
‘Til I'm back where my brother went, that's what my tomb will say
Right above my government; Dumile
Either unmarked or engraved, hey, who's to say?

[Verse 3: MF DOOM]
Doomsday, ever since the womb
‘Til I'm back to the essence, read it off the tomb
Either engraved or unmarked grave, who's to say?
Pass the mic like "Pass the peas like they used to say"
Some M-er F-ers don't like how Sally walk
I'll tell y'all fools it's hella cool how ladies from Cali talk
Never let her interfere with the Yeti ghetto slang
Nicknames off nipplin' tip of nipples metal fang
Known amongst hoes for the bang-bang
Known amongst foes for flow without no talking orangutans
Only gin and Tang
Guzzled out a rusty tin can, me and this mic is like yin and yang
Clang! Crime don't pay, listen, youth
It's like me holding up the line at the kissing booth
I took her back to the truck, she was uncouth
Spittin' all out the sunroof, through her missing tooth
But then she has a sexy voice, sound like Jazzy Joyce
So I turned it up faster than a speeding knife
Strong enough to please a wife
Able to drop today's math in the 48 keys of life
Cut the crap far as rap
Touch the mic, get the same thing a Arab will do to you for stealing
What the Devil? He's on another level
It's a word! No, a name! MF - the Super-Villain!

[Outro: Pebbles the Invisible Girl & MF Doom]
Doomsday
To dig the sound
Crowd around
When I was led to you
I knew you were the one for me
I swear the whole world could feel you MC

[Intro: Lil Wayne & Sample]
This is the archetypal rock sound
Ok this really ain't no rock shit
But um, leggo!

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Hollygrove monster, New Orleans maniac
Shoot a nigga up until his whole body ain't attached
Hi, my name is best rapper alive
And your mouth is the best crapper alive
'Cause you talk shit, I get hit and walk it off
Like fuck that, then I just spit like barking dogs
Call it "bust-back," attitude like "fuck em all"
And I'm greasy, and your boyfriend is a butterball
What's geezy? I mean what's good? Bitch, is you blind?
Check my watch, bet it be money all the time
Sunny on the side where I stay at
Where M.I.A. at? I get pussy every time I say that
Haha! In the game room, I don't play that
Bitch nigga get laid down where he lay at
AK at your front door, Young Zoe
You can ask Brisco, shoot 'til my wrist sore
Coupe with a bitch low, who with the sick pour
I'm tired of the south, so in your mouth is where the dick go
Yeahhh! They like it when I say yeah, huh?
And your boyfriend's a tampon
And I don't own land, baby, I own a landmine
So step on my land and catch a bomb like Anquan
Weezy F and the 'F' is for franchise
You looking at me is like you're looking through ant eyes
Hahaha! Young Money can't die
Bitch, we like Hancock
Yeah, I'm a Martian; what you saying, Spock?
I turn your beef into a hamhock
Then I put it in a pan pot, shoot 'til my hand hot
I can't hear you saying stop, I hear nina saying "pop"
I hear choppers saying "chop"
I hear niggas screaming and shit, like I say "holla at ya boy, bitch"
But holla at ya boy bitch
I'm the boy bitch, not ya boy bitch, 'cause ya boy a bitch
Hahahaha! Young Moola Crazy!

[Verse 2: Gudda Gudda]
Eastside Loco, you're sweet like cocoa
And you can get your ass beat fast like go-go
Mask on my face, low pro that a no show
Shoot a rapper when his album drop give 'em promo
You clown like bozo, they ask him bout the group shit
It's time to get the loot, bitch; I had to go solo
Your bitch all on me, you better watch your ho, though
She wanna come kick it like a dojo, uh-oh
Slick nigga, fuck 'em, then I drop 'em like a low-low
Bitch want money; like Millz: "No, no-no"
Nigga, if you hating, suck a dick; no homo
Boy I keep it gutter like bo-bos
Yeah I'm doing what I do, so nigga, just do you
And my gun nicknamed menage; she do two
Nigga, welcome to the Young Money Ape Zoo Crew
We starving and you could get ate like zoo-zoos
Niggas boo-hoo, cry; motherfucker, I'm heartless
I'll break bones and cartilage
You are just a mark muthafucker; I'm a marksman
And I'm all about the green like Boston
Pardon me, nigga, I'm talking reckless
You walk into a gun fight, knife, no vest, bitch you crazy
Just like the ice you wearing, you fugazi
Put 'em in the dirt; make 'em push a few daisies
80's baby, soon-to-be rich nigga
King Kong beating on my chest, on you bitch niggas
Paper I'm after, so I'm on your ass now
Young Money: motherfucking cash cow
GUDDA!

Dog, are you fucking kidding?
My hat, my shoes, my coat, Louis Vuitton stitch
With Donatella Versace, that's Louis Vuitton, bitch
I think Hennessy, I drink, I'm gone
Off that Bacardi Limon and Corona, I'm zonin'
Class back in session so I upped it a grade
In two years, Dwayne Wayne became Dwyane Wade
And hey, please don't start me
I'm like Gnarls Barkley meets Charles Barkley
I'm pop the Barkers, I'm hood the Parkers
While y'all was in limbo, I raised the bar up
I touched on everything
Married to the game, rock a chain 'steada wedding ring
Y'all bridesmaids catch the garter
On nights when 'Ye romance, cameras flash so much
That I gotta do that Yayo dance
I'm on a world tour with Common, my man
After each and every show, a couple dykes in the van
It's easy, the hood love to listen to Jeezy and Weezy
And, oh yeah, Yeezy, I did it for the glory

[Chorus: Kanye West & Choir (with backing vocals from John Legend)]
Yeah my
I can't study no, yeah my
I can't study no, yeah my
The glory
I can't study no, yeah my
I can't study no, yeah my
I did it for the glory
I can't study no, yeah my
I can't study no, yeah my
The glory
I can't study no, yeah my
I can't study no, yeah my

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
What I'm supposed to do now? Man, the game all messed up
How I'm suppose to stand out when everybody get dressed up?
So yeah, at the Grammys I went ultra Travolta
Yeah, that tuxedo might have been a little guido
But with my ego, I can stand there in a Speedo
And be looked at like a fucking hero
The glory, the story, the chain, the polo, the night
The grind, the empty bottles of No-Doz
Tank on empty, whipping my momma Volvo
I spent that gas money on clothes with logos
The fur is Hermes, shit that you don't floss
The Goyard so hard, man, I'm Hugo's boss
Why I gotta ask what that TUDOR cost?
House on the hill, two doors from Tracey Ross
And I'm asking 'bout her girlfriends, yeah, the dark skin'ed ones
She asking 'bout the speed boats, yeah, I admit we rented 'em
When you meet me in person, what do you feel like?
I know, I know, I look better in real life
I hear people compare themselves to big a lot
You know, B.I.G. and Pac, you know to get it hot
I guess after I live, I wanna be compared to B.I.G
Any one: Big Pun, Big L or Notorious
'Till then, get money and stunt and stay glorious
And I'm gonna stop killing these niggas soon as the chorus hit
Yeah, I'ma stop killing these niggas soon as the chorus hit, uh
These haters be killing themselves, they wanna come and get the glory

[Chorus: Kanye West & Choir (with backing vocals from John Legend)]
Yeah my
I can't study no, yeah my
I can't study no, yeah my
The glory
I can't study no, yeah my
I can't study no, yeah my
Now where the South Side?
I can't study no, yeah my
I can't study no, yeah my
Now where the West Side?
I can't study no, yeah my
I can't study no, yeah my

[Outro: Laura Nyro sample]
I can't study war, yeah my
I can't study war, yeah my
I can't study war, yeah my
I can't study war, yeah my

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I loved her fancy underwear, I sit behind her every year
Waiting for the chance to get to tell her
I'm the one she should be with
She's popular wit all the guys, so innocent in my eyes
I can see her in my life, she woulda had the world if she were mine
But see, she had other plans, I couldn't understand
Her and her stupid friends, Varsity's biggest fans
Never forget the day she laughed and walked away
And I couldn't stop her, I guess she had it all

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
She had it all figured out when she left me with a broken heart
Fucked around and turned me down
'Cause she didn't think I could play the part
But now the prom queen, the prom queen
Is cryin', sittin' outside of my door
See you never know how
How everything can turn around

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
They loved her fancy underwear, every boyfriend, every year
She tried to keep them entertained
When they can hardly remember her name
She did everything she could just to make them laugh and treat her good
She finds herself alone, askin' herself, where did she go wrong
She didn't realize she chased the type of guys
That don't believe in ties, tryin' to apologize
Never forget the day she left and walked away
And I couldn't stop her, I guess she had it all

[Chorus]
She had it all figured out when she left me with a broken heart
Fucked around and turned me down
'Cause she didn't think I could play the part
But now the prom queen, the prom queen
Is cryin', sittin' outside of my door
See you never know how
How everything can turn around

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
Yeah
Yeah
Oh
Uh
Uh

[Chorus: Lil Wayne & Shanell]
She had it all figured out when she left me with a broken heart
Fucked around and turned me down
'Cause she didn't think I could play the part
But now the prom queen, the prom queen
Is cryin', sittin' outside of my door
See you never know how
How everything can turn around

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams & Chuck D]
You can catch me ridin' down on the fuckin' Verrazano
Ass out just like Diallo, Diablo
Hi-Ho Silver, call that motherfucker Tonto
Leave a smoke trail back in Jersey in my condo
You can run up like you're Rambo
But you better hit me nigga, if you know what I know
'Cause I got some supersize guys that'll hit you with a combo
Pronto, you won't see the mornin' like Alonzo (Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Camo shorts, no socks, with the red Bapes
Walk into my closet, fuck around and get a headache
Fuck you so good, shawty you gonna need a bed break
Red Viper slither through the street like a red snake
Red diamonds in my chain lookin' like a red snake
Fuckin' with me wrong, man, you gonna need some yellow tape
"All them awards, Wayne, do you need a medal case?"

[Bridge: Lil Wayne & Chuck D]
(Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes)
Hahaha, uhh

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams & Chuck D]
You got that mean mug grill, that red in your eyes
That Ace Of Spades baby, talkin' big-boy size
Get a stack in each hand, and hold it like you're fresh
They say man it's like that
Say "Yes nigga, yes nigga, yes"
Your money and your girls, chillin' in the VIP
Stop for a second and gyrate them hips
Get a stack in each hand, and hold it like you're fresh
If they say man it's like that (Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes)
Say "Yes nigga, yes nigga, yes"

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Yes I make money, I'm a paper machine
And you can catch me in the newest, not the latest machine
"Now, Weezy, why you drive so fast?" Because I'm chasin' a dream
And when I catch that motherfucker, I'ma rape it and leave
Yeah, Its Young Tunechi, now give me some pussy
I ain't gotta paper chase, 'cause my paper come to me
I know money look good
Bitch I knew that why you lookin', huh

[Bridge: Lil Wayne & Chuck D]
(Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes)
Hahaha, err

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Ridin' by myself in that all-red Enzo
Smoke make it look like I got tinted windows
Young Money, bitch, but for short it's YM, ho
Love that shit so much I went and iced out the symbol
All my niggas scarin' ya, all your niggas scarier
Scarier than a cat in a cage with a Terrier
Pet cemetery, Wayne, are you the veterinarian?

[Bridge: Lil Wayne & Chuck D]
(Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes)
Hahaha

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams & Chuck D]
You got that mean mug grill, that red in your eyes
That Ace Of Spades baby, talkin' big-boy size
Get a stack in each hand, and hold it like you're fresh
They say man it's like that
Say "Yes nigga, yes nigga, yes"
Your money and your girls, chillin' in the VIP
Stop for a second and gyrate them hips
Get a stack in each hand, and hold it like you're fresh
If they say man it's like that (Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes)
Say "Yes nigga, yes nigga, yes"

[Verse 5: Lil Wayne]
Yes I do it big, call me Little Astronomical
Weezy F. Baby, and the 'F' is for phenomenal
Type of nigga go and get his hood 'cross his abdominal
You could check my watch, I been rich a long time ago
I'm so tired of ballin', man, I sleep all night
Bed sheets so nice, bed bugs don't bite
I ask her do she wanna fuck, before I ask twice, she say

[Bridge: Lil Wayne & Chuck D]
(Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes)
Hahaha, uhh

[Verse 6: Lil Wayne]
Yes I am a beast, I swear I needs to be tranquilized
Yes I am a giant, next to me you are just ankle high
Yes I eat that pussy, oh, how do I love that panty pie
Keep my hair shampooed and yes, I keep my hands sanitized
New Orleans baller, ask ESPN
Just kickin' it with the Bruce Lee-esbian
"Do you really think you're better than the rest?"

[Bridge: Lil Wayne & Chuck D]
(Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes)
Haha, uhh, bitch, I'm the best

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams, Lil Wayne & Chuck D]
You got that mean mug grill, that red in your eyes (Yeah)
That Ace Of Spades baby, talkin' big-boy size (Yeah)
Get a stack in each hand, and hold it like you're fresh
They say man it's like that (That)
Say "Yes nigga, yes nigga, yes" (Yes)
Your money and your girls, chillin' in the VIP (Yes, yes)
Stop for a second and gyrate them hips (Ye-e-eah)
Get a stack in each hand, and hold it like you're fresh (Hold it like)

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Yes, yes, ye-e-eah, ye-e-eah (Haha, uhh)
Young Mula, baby
And like I said it that time, I'ma say it again, um
Young Mula, baby

[Verse 1]
Been dazed and confused for so long, it's not true
Wanted a woman, never bargained for you
Lots of people talk, and few of them know
Soul of a woman was created below, yeah

[Verse 2]
You hurt and abuse, telling all of your lies
Run 'round, sweet baby, Lord, how they hypnotize
Sweet little baby, I don't know where you've been
Gonna love you, baby, here I come again

[Extra Verse]
If you're going to San Francisco
Be sure to wear some flowers in your hair
If you're going to San Francisco
You're gonna meet a lot of gentle people there

[Verse 3]
Every day I work so hard, bringing home my hard-earned pay
Try to love you, baby, but you push me away
Don't know where you're going, only know just where you've been
Sweet little baby, I want you again

[Instrumental break 1:58-5:25]

[Guitar Solo, with ad libs by Plant]
....oh, don't leave me so confused...
... oohh, baby

[Verse 4]
Been dazed and confused for so long, it's not true
Wanted a woman, never bargained for you
Take it easy, baby, let them say what they will
Tongue wag so much when I send you the bill
Ooh yeah, all right

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ah, ah, ah

[Intro: Seven Up]
Yo, yo, yo
What's up, what's the deal?
It's your boy, Seven Up, man
You already know if it's up, then it's stuck, and all that
But you already know how it is, man
Shout out to Nicki Minaj, man
I just wanted to share, man, you already know
Free makeup, mixtapes, and all that, you know how we give it up
Got me yellin' on a plane, man, listen up, man

[Verse 1 (False Start): Nicki Minaj]
Uh-huh, uh-huh, yo, ayo
I was on the plane with Dwayne
You can call me Whitley, I go to Hillman
Listen, I'm the baddest in the school, the baddest in the game
Excuse me, honey, but nobody's in my lane
When you was in New York, you was fuckin' a Yankee
I was fuckin' with base, I was pitchin' to Franky
These bitches so cranky, get 'em a hanky
M-mommy, I'm cold, gimme my bla-

[DJ Drop: Nicki Minaj & DJ Holiday]
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah!
Okay, okay, woah, woah, Holiday
Wait, hold on, hold on, Holiday!
You can't give it to 'em dry like that
You gotta get that shit wet first, nigga
Like, come on now!  (I got you!)
You gotta prep them for shit like that
They can't just get that shit right off the top
Like, you gotta bring that shit back
Bring that shit the fuck back! (Let's go!)

Nicki Minaj, DJ Holiday, Mizay Entertainment
Shouts out Trap-A-Holics, we run this!

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Uh-huh, uh-huh, yo, ayo
I was on the plane with Dwayne
You can call me Whitley, I go to Hillman

Excuse me, honey, but nobody's in my lane

I was fuckin' with base, I was pitchin' to Franky
These bitches so cranky, get 'em a hanky
M-mommy, I'm cold, gimme my blankie
Flyer than a kite, I get higher than Rapunzel
Keep the Snow White, I could buy it by the bundle
Step your cookies up 'fore they crumble
Don't be actin' like the Cardinals and gon' fumble
'Cause I'm a Steeler, fresh up out the dealer
All the dope boys gon' feel her
Flow so sick I need a healer
Fuck is my MAC concealer?
I be out in Queens on the back of four-
Whee-whee-whee-whee-whee-whee-wheelers, I'm a big deal
That's why I get more head than a pigtail
Put some ranch out, I’m gettin' the munchies
I think I'll have a rap bitch for my entrée
'Cause they be thinking they can spit, spit-shine my shoes
You know I keep a bad bitch, let me sign your boobs
I'm the only thing hoppin', like a kangaroo
I mean the only thing poppin', like a can of brew
Listen, you should buy a sixteen, 'cause I write it good
That 808 woof-woof, 'cause I ride it good
And bitches can't find they man, 'cause I ride it good
I'm the wolf, where is Little Red-a Riding Hood?

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Now, if you see a itty bitty piggy in the market
Give that bitch a quarter and a car, tell her, "Park it"
I don't fuck with pigs, like "as-salamu alaykum"
I put 'em in a field, I let Oscar Mayer bake 'em
And if you see a itty bitty piggy in the market
Give that bitch a quarter and a car, tell her, "Park it"
I don't fuck with pigs, like "as-salamu alaykum"
I put 'em in a field and I let Oscar Mayer bake 'em, bitches

[Interlude: Nicki Minaj]
Wow
It's like I just single-handedly annihilated, you know, every rap bitch in the building
Like, like, I'm Nicki Minaj, Nicki Lewinsky, Nicki the Ninja, Nicki the Boss, Nicki the Harajuku Barbie
Like, I mean, I don't even know why you girls bother at this point
Like, give it up! It's me!
I win! You lose Hahahahahahaha
Oh, shit! Hahaha, yo

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a, I'm a bad bitch
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a, I'm a bad bitch

I'm a bad bitch, I'm a, I'm a bad bitch

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
Hahahahahaha

And we got them bitches like 2 live crew
How do I do? That do I do

Trust me I have seen the days when the sun would burn like a perm
Make the barrel turn, quicker than usual, this is the usual
My niggas know when to lose you
But it ain't a game though
Give your ass a brain hole
Damn my nigga you fly, hope they bury you in the same clothes

[Hook: Lil Wayne]

[Verse 2: Tyga]

Left, right, back, forth, front, back, see-saw
Balancing life as a rap star
Oohh god, they lovin me then they hate me
Then they help when I fall, but how strong is that helpless arm?
Wait this is wrong, don't need your help at all, Tyga got it
Tyga on,They say he raw, Wayne got involved
Compton's own, Mr. Different From Y'all
I call her Miss Macaulay Culkin call, she call me when she home alone
Miss Little Tenant, I be in it like a landlord evicting
Your business, mind your business
Don't want to know the meaning of a witness' statement
Stay within your jurisdiction, cause I'm schooling-schooling niggas
In a whole 'nother district
Gods given, Hell risen, Rap, Pop, Hip-Hop nigga, Def Jam
I make Russel Simmons in the beginning
Young kids admire my finest a big brother figure
No Kanye Jigga
Just Young Money we the illest
G.E.D

[Intro: Jamie Foxx and Kanye West]
She take my money when I'm in need
Yeah, she's a triflin' friend indeed
Oh, she's a gold digger
Way over town that digs on me
(Uh)

[Chorus: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas

[Refrain: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said: "I can tell you rock, I can tell by your charm
Far as girls, you got a flock
I can tell by your charm and your arm"
But I'm lookin' for the one, have you seen her?
My psychic told me she'll have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
And I gotta take all they bad asses to ShowBiz?
Okay, get your kids, but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got up in
We all went to din' and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl, then you better be paid
You know why? It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend said she used to fuck with Usher
I don't care what none of y'all say, I still love her

[Chorus: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger

(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Eighteen years, eighteen years
She got one of your kids, got you for eighteen years
I know somebody payin' child support for one of his kids
His baby mama car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV any given Sunday
Win the Super Bowl and drive off in a Hyundai
She was supposed to buy your shorty Tyco with your money
She went to the doctor, got lipo with your money
She walkin' around lookin' like Michael with your money
Shoulda got that insured, Geico for your money
If you ain't no punk
Holla, "We want prenup! We want prenup!" (Yeah!)
It's somethin' that you need to have
‘Cause when she leave yo' ass, she gon' leave with half
Eighteen years, eighteen years
And on the eighteenth birthday, he found out it wasn't his?

[Chorus: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas
(She give me money) Now, I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
(When I'm in need) But she ain't messin' with no broke niggas

(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Now, I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want a dude to smoke, but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat, he can't pay, y'all can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves
But while y'all washin', watch him
He gon' make it to a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition, baby, look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries
So stick by his side
I know there's dudes ballin', and yeah, that's nice
And they gonna keep callin' and tryin', but you stay right, girl
And when he get on, he'll leave yo' ass for a white girl

[Refrain: Kanye West & (Jamie Foxx)]
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head, get down
(I gotta leave) Get down girl, go 'head

[Outro: Kanye West]
Let me hear that back

[Intro]
One, two, three
Turn it up

[Verse 1]
Big wheels keep on turnin'
Carry me home to see my kin
Singin' songs about the southland
I miss Alabamy once again
And I think it's a sin, yes

[Verse 2]
Well I heard Mr Young sing about her (Southern man)
Well, I heard ol' Neil put her down
Well, I hope Neil Young will remember
A Southern man don't need him around, anyhow

[Chorus]
Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you

[Verse 3]
In Birmingham they love the governor (Boo! Boo! Boo!)
Now we all did what we could do
Now Watergate does not bother me
Does your conscience bother you?
Tell the truth

[Chorus]
Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you
Here I come, Alabama

[Guitar solo]

[Bridge]
(Ah-ah-ah, Alabama
Ah-ah-ah, Alabama
Ah-ah-ah, Alabama
Ah-ah-ah, Alabama)

[Verse 4]
Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers
And they've been known to pick a song or two (Yes, they do)
Lord, they get me off so much
They pick me up when I'm feeling blue
Now how 'bout you?

[Chorus]
Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you
Sweet home Alabama (Oh, sweet home, baby)
Where the skies are so blue (And the governor's true)
Sweet home Alabama (Lordy)
Lord, I'm coming home to you (Yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
Mont... Montgomery's got the answer

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Ooh, L-Don
Fuck that 

[?]

[?] in this bitch with me
Fuq', hit the weed
You got all that shit, E-I?
Ugh, ugh

[Verse: Lil Wayne]
I got Young Money up, and now, I got my feet up
Tune in this bitch, tell my niggas throw them Bs up
Doing what the fuck I want, hate me all the fuck you want
Real niggas fuck with me, and I don't give a fuck who don't
Lock the CEO up, and I'm the CEO, fuck
Prison in February, and I ain't in no rush
Drink 'til I throw up; nigga, roll more blunts
Ball so hard, man, I gotta go pro once
Hit 'em with the shotgun, call that shit "the stop button"
Call me Dr. Carter, AKA "Young Wild Nigga"
AKA "No trial, nigga," AK, click-clack, pow, nigga
Fucking with the kid and you'll be missing like Bilal, nigga
Yeah! Haha! Swagger stupid
Pack a Uzi
Hundred clips, nigga? That's a movie
Aim at your toupée
You sweet as Kool-Aid, cream brulée
I'm sharp as Blu-Ray, I fuck her today
Then she gotta skate—Young Lupe
I hit the beat hard—Bobby Boucher
I keep them tools on me, get the screwface
Flowers for the dead, here's a bouquet
L.V.'s, nigga, on every suitcase
Y.M., nigga, it's a new day
We the champions, nigga, hoo-ray
Yeah! Hammer in the Louis duff'
Take a nigga bitch, she gave me brains until I knew enough
Bullet come too fast to adjust
I don't give a fuck about my roof that much
So I put it in the trunk, and then, the coupe sped up
Take the chopper out the trunk and just shoot that up
I'm Weezy F. and the "F" is for "Flame"
Eat these rappers, chef of the game
Shit on the track, shit on the train
Murder the beat—the beat was slain
Rest in peace, that's a shame, he kill anybody song
Versatile as fuck, I switch it up like Dennis Rodman dome
No homo, you rocking wrong; rest in peace, my styrofoam
Now, they wanna know what I be on
Get the fuck off my dick, my cock, my bone
Bi—Big money, my pockets long, New Orleans, I got my home
And they got my back—pause; no homo, no maricón
Smoking on that private-grown, it put me where I belong
All about my cheese: cheddar, mozzarella, provolone
Fuck her for an hour-long, let her take a shower, gone
Sorry baby, but I'm in my I-don't-wan'-be-bothered zone
Yeah! Haha, you're a groupie
Get on your duty
Two women give me head, call that "Two-face"
Bitch, I'm too great
Take your food tray, I was born on doomsday
Ugh! Ain—Ain't no nigga like me
"What's up?" to my gang, big B's like a Breitling
Take a nigga bitch, she ride my dick like she cycling
Then, she can't walk, run, or jump, like white men
Ugh! F—Fuck you niggas wanna do?
No Ceilings, let the bullets rain on you
Weezy F, the "F" is for "Fuck what you’re going through"
Make your people mourn you

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Haha! OK, let's do it

[Verse 1: André 3000]
I came into this world high as a bird
From secondhand cocaine powder—I know it sounds absurd
I never tooted, but it's in my veins
While the rest of the country bungies off bridges without no snap-back
And bitches, they say they need that to shake they fannies in the ass clubs
They go the other route, turn each other out, burn each other out
Where a bona fide nigga like me can't even get no backrub these days
Ain't that bleak on they part?
But let me hold it down, 'cause they shut you down when you speak from your heart—now that's hard
While we ranting and raving 'bout gats
Nigga, they made them gats they got some shit that'll blow out our backs from where they stay at

[Hook: Andrea Martin]
Ooooh, I fear the battle's just begun
Ooooh, though we're here someday we will be gone
So I'm hoping (Hoping), wishing (Wishing), praying
To keep my faith in you (Keep my faith)
In you, in you

[Verse 2: André 3000]
I'm fascinated by the way your nipples peak at me through your blouse
Freaky me, freaky you can't help but be a-roused
'Scuse me, Lord, lustful thinking, but that's the way we was brought up
Sneaking to watch Playboy at night
We all must be caught up in worldly ways
Chemistry between boys and girls
Is a lot like when we went to the woods and laid with the squirrels
During P.E., we'd be exploring each others privates
Hunching with all our clothes on until we felt excited then (Aaaah)
Oh, now it's on from here on out
Put yo hands in the atmosphere if you know what I'm talking about
Now if too harsh then walk on out and I'll see you on the next song
They call it horny because it's devilish, now, see, we dead wrong

[Hook]
Ooooh, I fear the battle's just begun
Ooooh, though we're here someday we will be gone
So I'm hoping, wishing, praying
To keep my faith in you (Keep my faith in you)
In you (Oh, ooh)

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
People don't know the stress I'm dealing with, day to day (Day)
Speaking about the feeling I'm possessing for Renee
Moping around and wondering where she stay, saw her last that she lay
Give it another day, I say, but the Lord, he taketh away
Now give it back, Lord, 'cause that's like backboards without the rims
Me and my auntie was tight like Southwest
Before the pinks moved in
Like the niggas who owned the liquor store, crack cocaine, pimps and whores
Living up on this earth before a nigga like Daddy was born
But they be making it seem that my music and crime are a team
But I'm speaking the truth not dreams
So what in the fuck they mean, my lyrics ain't clean?

[Hook: Andrea Martin]
Ooooh, I fear the battle's just begun
Ooooh, though we're here, someday we will be gone (So I keep hoping)
So I'm hoping, wishing, praying (Praying)
To keep my faith in you (Keep my faith in you)
In you
Ooooh, I fear the battle's just begun
Ooooh, though we're here, someday we will be gone
So I'm hoping, wishing, praying
To keep my faith in you (My faith in you)
In you
Ooooh, I fear the battle's just begun
Ooooh, though we're here, someday, we will be gone (I keep hoping)
So I'm hoping, wishing, praying
To keep my faith in you

[Outro: Andrea Martin]
My faith in you
My faith in you
My faith in you (Keep my faith)
My faith in you
My faith in you
My faith in you
My faith—

[Verse]
Some days I just wanna up and call it quits
I feel like I'm surrounded by a wall of bricks
Every time I go to get up I just fall in pits
My life's like one great big ball of shit
If I could just put it all into all I spit
'Stead of always tryna swallow it
Instead of starin' at this wall and shit
While I sit, writer's block, sick of all this shit
Can't call it, shit, all I know is I'm about to hit the wall
If I have to see another one of Mom's alcoholic fits
This is it, last straw, that's all, that's it
I ain't dealin' with another fuckin' politic
I'm like a skillet bubblin' until it filters up
I'm about to kill it, I can feel it buildin' up
Blow this building up, I've concealed enough
My cup runneth over, I done filled it up
The pen explodes and busts, ink spills my guts
You think all I do is stand here and feel my nuts
Well, I'ma show you what, you gon' feel my rush
You don't feel it, then it must be too real to touch
Peel the Dutch, I'm about to tear shit up
Goosebumps, yeah, I'ma make your hair sit up
Yeah, sit up, I'ma tell you who I be
I'ma make you hate me 'cause you ain't me
You wait, it ain't too late to finally see
What you closed-minded fucks were too blind to see
Whoever finds me is gonna get a finder's fee
Out this world, ain't no one out their mind as me
You need peace of mind? Here's a piece of mine
All I need's a line
But sometimes I don't always find the words to rhyme
To express how I'm really feelin' at that time
Yeah, sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
It's just sometimes, it's always me
How dark can these hallways be?
The clock strikes midnight, one, two, then half-past three
This half-assed rhyme with this half-assed piece
Of paper (*rip*) I'm desperate at my desk
If I can just get the rest of the shit off my chest again
Stuck in a slump, can't think of nothin'
Fuck, I'm stumped up, oh wait, here comes somethin'
(*Crumples paper*) Nope, it's not good enough, scribble it out
New pad, crinkle it up, and throw the shit out
I'm fizzlin' now, thought I figured it out
Ball's in my court, but I'm scared to dribble it out
I'm afraid, but why am I afraid?
Why am I a slave to this trade?
Cyanide I spit to the grave
Real enough to rile you up
Want me to flip it? I can rip it any style you want
I'm a switch hitter, bitch, Jimmy Smith ain't a quitter
I'ma sit until I get enough in me to finally hit a
Fuckin' boiling point, put some oil in your joints
Flip the coin, bitch, come get destroyed
An MC's worst dream, I make 'em tense
They hate me, see me and shake like a chain-link fence
By the looks of 'em, you would swear that Jaws was comin'
By the screams of 'em, you would swear I'm sawin' someone
By the way they're runnin', you would swear the law was comin'
It's now or never, and tonight is all or nothin'
"Momma, Jimmy keeps leavin' on us
He said he'd be back, he pinky promised, I don't think he's honest-"
I'll be back, baby I just gotta beat this clock
Fuck this clock, I'ma make 'em eat this watch
Don't believe me? Watch, I'ma win this race
And I'ma come back and rub my shit in your face
Bitch, I found my niche, you gon' hear my voice
'Til you're sick of it, you ain't gonna have a choice
If I gotta scream 'til I have half a lung
If I have half a chance, I'll grab it—Rabbit, run!

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Check it
Well it's the M-I-crooked letter, ain't no one better
And when I'm on the microphone you best to wear your sweater
'Cause I'm cooler than a polar bear's toenails
"Oh hell, there he go again talking that shit"
Bend corners like I was a curve, I struck a nerve
And now you 'bout to see this Southern playa serve
I heard it's not where you're from but where you pay rent
Then I heard it's not what you make but how much you spent
You got me bent like elbows, amongst other things, but I'm not worried
'Cause when we step up in the party; like a mouse, you scurry
So go get your fucking shine box and your sack of nickels
It tickles to see you try to be like Mr. Pickles
Daddy Fat Sax, B-I-G B-O-I
It's that same motherfucka that took them knuckles to your eye
And I try, to warn you not to test but you don't listen
Giving the shout-out to my Uncle Darnell locked up in prison

[Hook: Big Boi & Andre 3000]
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, "O-Yea-yer"
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, "O-Yea-yer"

[Verse 2: Andre 3000]
Now, my oral illustration be like clitoral stimulation
To the female gender, ain't nothing better
Let me know when it's wet enough to enter
If not I'll wait, because the future of the world depends on
If or if not the child we raise gon' have that nigga syndrome
Or will it know to beat the odds regardless of the skin tone?
Or will it feel that if we tune it, it just might get picked on?
Or will it give a fuck about what others say and get gone?
They alienate-us cause we different keep your hands to the sky
Like Sounds of Blackness when I practice what I preach ain't no lie
I'll be the baker and the maker of the piece of my pie
Now breaker, breaker 10-4 can I get some reply?
Now everybody say

[Hook: Big Boi & Andre 3000]
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, "O-Yea-yer"
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, "O-Yea-yer"

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Every day I sit while my nigga be in school
Thinking about the second album at the Dungeon shooting pool
Like E-S to the P-N, cause we adjust to the beat in the zone (zone)
Honey, I'm home but I'm not married
Carried a lot of problems around being frustrated
And now I'm sitting at the end of the month I just made it
Like you made the B team, and like your daddy's wife you making that coffee
You heard the ATLiens, so back the hell up off me

[Verse 4: Andre 3000]
Softly as if I played piano in the dark
Found a way to channel my anger now to embark
The world's a stage and everybody gots to play their part
God works in mysterious ways, so when he starts
The job of speaking through us, we be so sincere with this here
No drugs or alcohol, so I can get the signal clear as day
Put my Glock away, I got a stronger weapon
That never runs out of ammunition, so I'm ready for war, okay

[Hook: Big Boi & Andre 3000]
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, "O-Yea-yer"
Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, "O-Yea-yer"

[Intro: Kanye West]
Party people in the place to be
You are now in the midst of a real emcee
Throw your hands in the air if you real as me
Ooh! Ow!

[Chorus: Kid Cudi, Charlie Wilson & Kanye West]
Ugh, ugh, la-la-la (Hey, ugh)
La, la, la, la-la

(La, la, la, la-la) I know the city getting ready

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Such an easy morning, we on a ride
And I'm feeling smooth as the way the Benz drive
Turn the radio down if they playing that bullshit
They don’t want black people to think and drive

[Verse 2: Common, Common & Kanye West]
He think he live, he think he cold
He think I’m high, I’m in thinker mode
Eyes lowed, I let the sky hold the thoughts
The streets are like the high road that I go across, ugh

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I mean, my whole team 'bout to smash the streets
The Phillip Lim remind them that it’s Fashion Week
And the weather was unbearably hot
Did I mention that the sweater was a Jeremy Scott?
Did I mention G.O.O.D. Music, and forever we hot?

[Chorus: Kid Cudi, Kanye West, Kid Cudi & Kanye West]
Are you
Motherfucker, are you ready or not?
Ready to go? (Ugh)
I know the city getting ready for me

[Bridge: Kanye West & Charlie Wilson]
This goes out to the hardcore hip-hop (Can’t stop)
You can't stop
This goes out to the hardcore hip-hop (Can’t stop) (La, la, la, la-la)
You can't stop (La, la, la, la-la)

[Verse 4: Pusha T & Kid Cudi]
As Ye flips the piano
The mood swings like the change of a channel
He’s heating up like they wrapped him in flannel
Selling kilos through your iPod Nano
Cocaine vandal, I induct scandal
Money drive you crazy—look at Marbury’s handle
Vaseline face, reminiscent of my tires
Ice cream paint job, something like Breyer's
Euro tank top, Dior-inspired
Sell it to you hard, no assembly required
Yuugh! On 2012 in 2010
Which makes this a time machine, not just any Benz
Floss for the members of the gang with the 20 in
(Are you)
While haters wish death upon me, that’s many men
(Ready to go)
Yeah, and if he slam you on your paper route
(I know the city getting ready for me)
Stop talking, motherfucker, pull your paper out
(I know the city getting ready for me)

[Chorus: Kid Cudi, Charlie Wilson, Big Sean & Kanye West]
(Ahh) Are you
(La, la, la) Ready to go?
(La, la, la, la-la) I know the city getting ready for me
(La, la, la, la-la) I know the city getting ready
(And let me hear you say, "Ahh", hey!) Are you
(La la la) Ready to go?
We smoking on that (La, la, la, la-la)
I know the city getting ready for me
We choking on that (La, la, la, la-la)
I know the city getting ready (Big Sean!)

[Verse 5: Big Sean & Kanye West]
Now tell me, do it feel good? Well, all right
Don’t worry, we gon' be here all night
And you know a nigga rep that Westside (Hanh?)
Westside (Hanh?), Westside
So t—t—tell me, who the freshest of them all?
They claiming that they fresh, they ain’t fresher than my balls
A nigga suited fresh like I'm headed to the ball
Emcee hunting season, putting heads up on the wall
I sneak-peeked ahead while we headed to the loft
Man, I always thought with the head inside my drawers
I guess that's why in school
My grades went from A's to B's to Cs
All over double-Ds, I be absent all week
This is for my niggas, all the ones I ride for (My niggas)
Man, that’s the fam, we let ‘em in through the side door
Hold on, that’s the girl you gave a wedding ring? (What?)
Man, me and my niggas nutted on her everything (Haha)

[Drum Break]

[Interlude: Charlie Wilson]
And let me hear you say, "Ahh"
La, la, la
La, la, la, la-la
La, la, la, la-la
And let me hear you say, "Ahh" (Ahh)
La, la, la (Oh, yeah)
La, la, la, la-la (Oh, oh, oh)
La, la, la, la-la (Ooh, wee)

[Verse 6: Kanye West]
Man, we promise
Now, put your hands up to the sky
Until the day in that we die
And we'll be here all evening
G.O.O.D. Fridays, I hope you have a nice weekend

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Are you
Ready to go?
I know the city getting ready for me
I know the city getting ready
Are you
Ready to go?
I know the city getting ready for me
I know the city getting ready
Are you
Ready to go?
I know the city getting ready for me
I know the city getting ready
Are you
Ready to go?
I know the city getting ready for me
I know the city getting ready

[Outro: Kid Cudi]
I know the city getting ready for me
I know the city getting ready

[Intro: Nicki Minaj & T-Pain]
(And we go by The Runners)
Yo, SB, haha (Go hard)
I think it's my time, you know why? (Go hard)
My tears have dried, and I know that no weapon formed against me will prosper (Go hard)
And I truly believe that my haters are my motivators
Young Money

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
If you could, you would get rid of me
Fuck you gon' do when a bitch try to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me (To me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard
If you was as real as me
You would never let another girl sit in your throne
I done put the chokehold
Now they screamin', "Nicki leave me alone!"
(Hard) I am (Hard), I'm still (Hard) the one to beat (Go hard)
Ain't in a rush for mainstream, I am the streets (Go hard)
I am getting it in until the end
I gotta go (Go), go (Go), go (Oh)
Go hard

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Gotta go, lemme get the car key
You don't want it with the Harajuku Barbie
Keep a marquee, everything sparkly (Man down)
Hit him on the walkie-talkie
Hit 'em, hit em, knock-knock, tell 'em let me in
My name ring bells, bitch, buzz me in (Bzzz)
And I only stop for pedestrians (Oh)
Or a real, real bad lesbian
Hit 'em with the MAC, hit 'em with the TEC-nine
Hit 'em with the Ruger, by the intersect sign
Hit 'em with a Tommy, so my niggas call me Pammy
And I always keep the jammy
In the trunk or in the Lamby
Put my whole borough on my back and I'm good
I don't wanna hear what you woulda, what you coulda
I represent all the girls that stood up (Uh)
Used to drink water with a little bit of sugar (Oh)
Now I'm in the gym with my squats and my sit-ups (One, two)
Doing the scissor-leg, on the mat, with my foot up
Young black pin-up, all of my bitches did up
Now I'm tellin' LA Reid to step his bid up
And I'm tellin' President Carter he picked a winner
Bitches like Nelly and Kelly got a dilemma (Uh)
These birds all fly south in the winter (Uh)
Fuck I look like? Chomping on a chicken dinner?
You can hate me, but why knock my hustle? (C'yeah)
I'ma be the queen, no matter how they shuffle
Skirts with the ruffle (Yeah), Louis on the duffle (Yeah)
I'm a bad bitch, no muzzle
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Hahahahahaha, no muzzle)
What you wanna do, do, do? (C'yeah)
Bitches is softer than Al Dente
Cut from a different kente
Tell 'em I'm the ninja, Weezy is my Sensei
So I call him Splinter, faster than a sprinter
Gimme my chopsticks, I'll have these rap bitches for dinner
This is for my gentlemen in button-ups, and khakis
This is for my nigga, Seven Up, in Castaki
This is for my niggas wheelie-in' them Kawasakis
Shout out to the Vackee's, saltfish ackees
Kisses to my fans unless I'm feelin', kinda cocky
Winter Wonderland is on my hand, it's kind of rocky
I am Nicki, Minaj or Lewinski
Pump's on the clutch, right hand, on the 6-speed
Write my own raps, I gotta go, I gotta get me (Gotta get me)
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Yeah), ohh

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
If you could, you would get rid of me
Fuck you gon' do when a bitch try to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me (To me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard
If you was as real as me
You would never let another girl sit in your throne
I done put the chokehold on
Now they screamin', "Nicki, leave me alone!"
(Hard) I am (Hard), I will (Hard), I gots to win (Go hard)
I'm still lookin' around for my competition (Go hard)
I am gettin' it in until the end
I gotta go (Go), go (Go), go (Oh)
Go hard

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
From slap-and-cry you start to die
So I must go harder
Gotta make these bitches know me
Just like Bobby know water
Better yet, like Bubba know shrimp
But he don't say shit when the gun on his lip
And I don't say shit, put the gun on my hip
So I don't say shit but the gun on my hip
If you don't wanna drown, don't come on my ship
Check out how them bitches just run on my dick
And me, I'm still nasty as a son of a bitch
I still got that bitch cum on my lips
If you ain't got money, don't come on my strip
And if you got money, don't come on my strip
I wear that metal, no Olympic
But I can still make you tumble and flip
You fuckin' with me if you fuckin' with Nic'
They ain't fuckin' with me, they ain't fuckin' with Nic'
Your girlfriend her decision is split
'Cause she wanna fuck me and she wanna fuck Nic
They wonder if he be fuckin' Nic, as long as she be fuckin' rich
That's why I keep my luggage 'cause I swear y'all a fuckin' trip
Young Money dungeon, bitch, my swagger just punchin' bitch
And I shoot like I'm from overseas, so call my gun "Gunović"
Weezy F Baby and the 'F' is for a bunch of shit
Red drank, blue pill, white dust, yes, I love my country, bitch
Hahaha, yeah, guitar

[Guitar Solo: Lil Wayne]

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, ohh

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Wish you could get rid of Young Money
Fuck you gon' do when a bitch try to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me (To me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard
If you was as real as me
You would never let another girl sit in your throne
I done put the chokehold on
Now they screamin', "Nicki leave me alone"
(Hard) I am (Hard), I will (Hard), I gots to win (Go hard)
I'm still lookin' around for my competition (Go hard)
I am gettin' it in until the end
I gotta go (Go), go (Go), go (Oh)
Go hard

[Intro]
Yeah, hey

[Verse]
To the college kids, no scholarships, starting your semester
Unpacking your suitcases filling up your dresser
Enjoy it while you got it, after that, it’s God bless ya
Life is your professor, know that bitch is gon' test ya
I got some shit I’d like to get off my chest
I spill out my soul, I spit out my stress
And can I spit out my stress?
It’s the feeling in the air
You bout to drop a real classic
He said, "Cole, a lil' birdy told me on the low you got a Illmatic”
Nobody touching Nas, nigga it’s more like Villematic
Uh, these Fayettenam tales be paying off well
What story is my audio theater gon' tell
I know my debut will ship, but is it gon' sell?
I guess it’s in God’s hands
I make the type of pieces that make Jesus say, "God damn"
That's for your non-believers, I’m the truth, only time'll teach ya
And fuck the haters, probably never love they mamas neither
Old bitter-ass sit around in middle class homes
With computers on hatin' on the newest song
While you was browsin', I was takin' out them student loans
Tryna do this shit better than the niggas we grew up on
Name a fuckin' song I ain't threw up on
Talk is cheap, it's like y'all grew up in a Jewish home
Hah, pardon the stereotype
But y'all giving me mixed feelings like I married a white woman
One minute I’m overrated, next minute I’m the savior
You hate it before you played it, I already forgave ya
For bullshitting, and that nigga Cole spitting that real
Wrote this line on a plane got flown straight from the Ville
To Miami, where the same time last year
I was broker than you, I just wanna make that clear
'Cause now I’m dealing with money I’ve never seen before
And R&B bitches want me, that was just dreams before
Now do I give into the temptation I’m facing?
The thought of losing a good woman keep me from chasing
But I’m just a man, at time’s the timing is wrong
Plus my dick is like a man with a mind of it’s own
But I’m tryna be strong, remind myself she ain’t about shit
These hoes the same, all that change is the outfit
Looking for cheese on some mouse shit
Suck a nigga, fuck a nigga, then go run they mouth quick
Rappers took a vacation I came over to house sit
You want change, this that between the seats in your couch shit
The fuck you thought, I lost it?
All that flame on my name would get exhausted
Au contraire, my nigga, they all ears
Sit back, enjoy the ride it’s finna be a long year, yeah
It’s finna be a long year, yeah

[Outro]
I know you feel that
The tingle in your spine, don’t conceal that
Don’t conceal that
This exactly what you thought, somebody bought the real back
Hey

[Intro]
Yeah
Same song and dance
Damn girl, everywhere I go
Same song and dance
I like the way you move, all over the globe
Same song and dance
Something about it, man
Same song and dance
In the pale moonlight, yo

[Verse 1]
I'm lookin' at ya, yeah girl, you're kinda tooken back by
The whole rapper thing, aren't ya?
Probably thinking you'll get slapped so dang hard, ya
Won't even be able to stand up straight, aren't ya?
Couple rape charges, people think you're a monster
The police constantly bugging you non-stop
I walk up on ya, “Well, hello Tonya”
I think you got your OnStar button inside your car stuck
You out of gas? Do you got a flat?
I would hate for you to be stranded at the laundromat
I got your back
Why don't you put your laundry baskets in the back
And sit up front; I'm not asking, it's a trap
You just got jacked and body snatched, and it's a wrap
In broad day, and no mask for this attack
I heard 'em say, "Exact opposites attract"
If that's a fact, it'll take task force to get you back
Come on

[Chorus]
Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you
I said, yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you crying to me?
Same song and dance

[Verse 2]
The first victim I had, she was a big one
Big movie star, a party girl, big fun
She was the girl the media always picked on
In and out of rehab every four-to-six months
She was always known for little pranks and slick stunts
At Nickelodeon, flashed the little kids once
What an event it was, I was sitting in front
I was hooked in at the first glimpse of them buns
Seen her backstage, now here's where I come in, son
Look, here she comes, I better pull out the big guns
"Hello Lindsay, you're looking a little thin, hun
How 'bout a ride to rehab? Get in, cunt!
But starting off on the wrong foot is what I didn't want
Girl, I'm just kidding, let me start over again, hun
See what I meant was, we should have a little intervention
Come with me to Brighton, let me relieve your tension
You little wench, ya, murder wasn't my intention
If I wanted to kill you, it would've already been done"
Slowly she gets in and I begin to lynch her
With 66 inches of extension cord

[Chorus]
Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you
I said, yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you crying to me?
Same song and dance

[Verse 3]
My second victim was even bigger than the first
Pop star, icon, the whole works
She played a little schoolgirl when she first
Burst upon the scene and seen that the world was hers
She twirls and turns and flirts in skirts so bad it hurts
It irked me, it made me mad at first
I lashed out in my songs, but what was really going on
Was that I had developed a crush
I just didn't know how to tell it to her
Should I cut off one of my ears and mail it to her?
Send her pictures of my collection of skeletons, or
Footage of me impaling myself on an elephant tusk?
We'll settle this once and for all, I'ma tell her at dusk
Tonight, tonight is the night, and tell her I must
Creep up to her mansion in stilettos, and just
Climb the gate, and ring the bell like, "Hello, my love
I just picked your prescription for Seroquel up
Now would you like to share a pill or two with me?
I'll share my Valium with you 'cause I'm feeling you Britney
I'll trade you a blue one for a pink one
Ever since a schoolgirl juvenile delinquent
I've been feeling you, ooh-ooh, girl, you sexy little gal, you
Hold that pill any longer, it'll get sentimental value
C'mon toots, give me the Valium alley-oop
I'll slam dunk it in your mouth 'til you puke
And just as soon as you pass out in your alphabet soup
I'm 'bout to make a new outfit out of you
New outfit? Shit, I'll make a suit out of you, shoot
Now, show me how you move, baby, do how a-you do"

[Chorus]
Yeah baby, do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl, shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you
I said, yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl, why you crying to me?
Same song and dance

[Outro]
Same kicking and screaming, same crying and sobbing
Same song and dance
Same begging and pleading, same yelling and bleeding
Same song and dance
Yeah
Same song and dance
I know
Same song and dance

[Chorus: RBX]
Remember me? Seven executions
Remember me? I have no remorse
Remember me? I'm high-powered
Remember me? I drop bombs, like Hiroshima

[Verse 1: RBX]
For this one, they scream "X, you retarded?!"
'Cause I grab the mic and get down like syndrome
Hide and roam into the masses
Without boundaries, which qualifies me
For the term “universal” without no rehearsal
I leak words that's controversial
Like I'm not the one you wanna contest, see
'Cause I'll hit your ass like the train did that bitch
That got banned from TV, heavyweight getup
Hit you, watch your whole head split up
Loco is the motion, we comin' through
Hollow-tips is the lead the .45 threw

[Chorus: Sticky Fingaz]
Remember me? Throw ya gunz in the air!
Remember me? Slam! Slam!
Remember me? Nigga, bacdafucup!
Remember me? Chka-chka-Onyx!

[Verse 2: Sticky Fingaz]
Niggas that take no for an answer get told no
Yeah, I been told no, but it was more like “No! No! No!”
Life's a bitch, met her, fuck you if you let her
Better come better than better to be a competitor
This vet is ahead of the shit, it's all redder, you deader and deader
A medic instead of the cheddars and credda
Settle vendetta with metal Beretta from ghetto to ghetto
Evidence, nope, never leave a shred of
I got the soul of every rapper in me, love me or hate me
My mom's got raped by the industry and made me
I'm the illest nigga ever, I told you
I get more pussy than them dyke bitches Total
Want beef, nigga? Pbbt, you better dead that shit
My name should be Can't-Believe-That-Nigga-Said-That-Shit
Probably sayin' he ain't a killer, but I'm killin' myself
Smoke death, fuck bitches raw on the kitchen floor
So think what I'ma do to you, have done to you
Got niggas in my hood who'd do that shit for a blunt or two
What you wanna do? Cocksuckers, we Glock busters
'Til the cops cuff us, gon' start ruckus and drop blockbusters
Round the clock hustlers, you cannot touch us
I'm gettin' wires, niggas wantin' me dead
Wantin' my head, you think it could be somethin' I said?

[Chorus: Eminem]
Remember me? I just don't give a fuck!
Remember me? Yeah, fuck you too!
Remember me? I'm low down and I'm shifty!
Remember me? I'm Shady!

[Verse 3: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
When I go out, I'ma go out shootin'
I don't mean when I die, I mean when I go out to the club, stupid!
I'm tryin' to clean up my fuckin' image
So I promised the fuckin' critics I wouldn't say “fuckin'” for six minutes
Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!
My baby's mom, bitch made me an angry blonde
So I made me a song, killed her and put Hailie on
I may be wrong, I keep thinkin' these crazy thoughts
In my cranium, but I'm stuck with a crazy mom
Is she really on as much dope as you say she's on?
Came home and somebody musta broke in the back window
And stole two loaded machine guns and both of my trench coats
Six sick dreams of picnic scenes
Two kids, sixteen, with M-16's and ten clips each
And them shits reach through six kids each
And Slim gets blamed in Bill Clint's speech to fix these streets?!
Fuck that! Pbbt, you faggots can vanish to volcanic ash
And reappear in hell with a can of gas and a match
Aftermath, Dre, grab the gat, show 'em where it's at!
(What the fuck you starin' at, nigga?)

[Outro: Eminem]
Don't you remember me?!
Remember me?!
Remember me?!
Remember me!! (Slim Shady!)

[Verse: 2-D & The Purple, the People, the Plastic Eating People Choir]
It's all good news now
Because we left the taps running for a hundred years
So drink into the drink, plastic cup drink
Drink with the purple, the people
The plastic eating people
Still connected to the moment it began

[Verse: 2-D & The Purple, the People, the Plastic Eating People Choir]

[Intro: Rick James & James Brown]
Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya, look at ya
Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya, look at ya
Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya, look at ya
Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya, look at ya (Ladies and gentlemen, ladies, ladies and gentlemen)

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
And I always find, yeah, I always find something wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
She find pictures in my email
I sent this bitch a picture of my dick
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good at that shit
See, I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
And I always find, yeah, I always find
Yeah, I always find something wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

[Bridge: Kanye West & Rick James]
Run away from me, baby
Ah, run away
Run away from me, baby (Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya)
Run away
When it starts to get crazy (Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya)
Then run away
Babe, I got a plan, run away as fast as you can
Run away from me, baby
Run away
Run away from me, baby (Look at, look at, look at, look at, look at, look at, look at ya)
Run away
When it starts to get crazy (Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya, look at ya)
Why can't she just run away?
Baby, I got a plan
Run away as fast as you can (Look at ya, look at ya, look at ya)

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Twenty-four seven, three sixty-five, pussy stays on my mind
I-I-I-I did it, alright, alright, I admit it
Now pick your next move, you could leave or live with it
Ichabod Crane with that motherfuckin' top off
Split and go where? Back to wearing knockoffs?
Haha, knock it off, Neimans, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in the baller-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless, P

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
'Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you knew of that advantage
'Cause you could blame me for everything
And I don't know how I'ma manage
If one day, you just up and leave

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West]
And I always find, yeah, I always find something wrong
You been puttin' up with my shit just way too long
I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Let's have a toast for the douchebags
Let's have a toast for the assholes
Let's have a toast for the scumbags
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast for the jerk-offs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

[Outro: Kanye West]

[Non-Lyrical Vocals]

[Verse 1]
I was staring at the sky, just looking for a star
To pray on, or wish on, or something like that
I was having a sweet fix of a daydream of a boy
Whose reality I knew, was a-hopeless to be had
But then the dove of hope began its downward slope
And I believed for a moment that my chances
Were approaching to be grabbed
But as it came down near, so did a weary tear
I thought it was a bird, but it was just a paper bag

[Chorus]
Hunger hurts and I want him so bad, oh, it kills
'Cause I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up
I got to fold cause these hands are too shaky to hold
Hunger hurts, but starving works
When it costs too much to love

[Verse 2]
And I went crazy again today
Looking for a strand to climb, looking for a little hope
Baby said he couldn't stay
Wouldn't put his lips to mine and a fail to kiss is a fail to cope
I said, "Honey, I don't feel so good, don't feel justified
Come on put a little love here in my void,"
He said "It's all in your head,"
And I said, "So's everything" but he didn't get it
I thought he was a man but he was just a little boy

[Chorus]
Hunger hurts, and I want him so bad, oh, it kills
'Cause I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up
I got to fold cause these hands are too shaky to hold
Hunger hurts, but starving works
When it costs too much to love
Hunger hurts but I want him so bad, oh, it kills
'Cause I know I'm a mess that he don't wanna clean up
I got to fold because these hands are just too shaky to hold
Hunger hurts, but starving works me
When it costs too much to love
Oh, hunger hurts but I want him so bad, oh, it kills
'Cause I know I'm a mess that he don't wanna clean up
I got to fold because these hands are just too shaky to hold
Hunger hurts, but starving, it works
When it costs too much to love, hmm, hmm

[Intro: Heart (Sampled)]
Tell myself that I was doing alright
There's nothing left to do tonight
But go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh

[Verse 1]
Can't you see what you do to me, baby?
You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac
I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick
You're truly the only one who can do this to me
You just make me get so crazy
I go schizo, I get so insane, I just go schizophrenic
One minute I wanna slit your throat, the next I wanna sex
You make me crazy, the way we act
Like two maniacs in the sack
We fuck like two jackrabbits
And maybe that's a bad habit
'Cause the next day we're right back at it
In the same exact pattern
What the fuck is the matter with us?
We can't figure out if it's lust or it's love
What's that that's attractin' us to each other?
They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother
Which would explain why you're such a motherfuckin' bitch
But I stay and still stick it out with you
Even though I just hit you today
But you deserve it, you hit me first and provoked me to choke you
Just 'cause I came home late last night
Crawled in bed and I woke you
But if there's one thing about you that I admire it's, baby
Because you stay with me, maybe 'cause you're as crazy as I am
'Cause when I look at you I can see an angel in your eyes
But if I look deeper inside I see your freakish little side
Like a devil in disguise, you're always full of surprises
Always pullin' devices out your purse: little vibrators and dildoes
You fucked yourself so much you barely feel those anymore
You're only 24, but you're plenty more ma-ture
Than those other little hoes who just act like little girls
Like they're in middle school still
You're crazy, sexy, cool, chill
And you play your position, you never step outta line
Even though I stay in your business you've always kept outta mine
I wonder what's on your mind
Sometimes they say love is blind
Maybe that's why the first time
I dotted your eye you ain't see the sign
Or maybe you did, maybe you like being shoved
Maybe 'cause we're crazy in love

[Chorus: Heart (Sampled)]
Go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh

[Verse 2]
You are the ink to my paper, what my pen is to my pad
The moral, the very fiber, the whole substance to my rap
You are my reason for being, the meaning of my existence
If it wasn't for you I would never be able to spit this
As intense as I do, and the irony is you rely on me
As much as I rely on you to inspire me like you do
You provide me the lighter fluid, the fuel to my fire
You're my entire supply: gas, the match, and igniter
The only way that I am able to stay so stable
Is you're the legs to my table
If you were to break I'd fall on my face
But I'm always gonna make you feel I don't need you as much
As I really need you so you don't use it to your advantage
But you're essential to me, you're the air I breathe I believe
If you ever leave me I'd probably have no reason to be
You are the Kim to my Marshall, you're the Slim to my Shady
The Dre to my Eminem, the Alaina to my Hailie
You are the word that I'm lookin' for
When I'm tryin' to describe how I feel inside
And the right one just won't come to my mind
You're like the pillar that props me up, the beam that supports me
The bitch who never took half, the wife who never divorced me
You're like the root to my evil, you let my devil come out me
You let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me
And no matter how much, too much is never enough
Maybe 'cause we're crazy in love

[Chorus: Heart (Sampled)]
Go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh

[Verse 1: Drake]
Falling too fast
Clearly rules don't apply
Can't believe that I just met you
You got me here
Watching minutes past by
Wondering when to expect you
There you go, is this a dream?
Looking like every picture that I've seen of you before
I've seen it all before

[Hook]
Now that it's over
I should of known better
Then you think this is real and
You could be mine
I should have known better
Slowed it down cause I feel
You needed time

[Hook]
But I kept thinking
This could be something
This could be something
This could be something
This could be
This could be
This could be something
This could be something
This could be something
Maybe it's just nothing at all
But this could be something
This could be something
This could be
This could be
This could be something
This could be something
This could be something

Maybe it's just nothing at all
At all... at all
Maybe it's just nothing at all
At all... at all

I guess it's what we make it

I guess it's what we make it

I guess it's what we

[Produced by Francis and the Lights]

[Verse 1: Drake]
Things have been so crazy and hectic
I shoulda gotten back by now
But you know how much I wanted to make it
It's probably better anyhow
So if you gotta go
If there's anything I should know
If the spotlight makes you nervous
If you're looking for a purpose

[Verse 2: Drake]
You put the tea in the kettle and light it
Put your hand on the metal and feel it
But do you even feel it anymore?
I remember when you thought I was joking
Now I'm off singing karaoke
Further than I've ever been
So if you gotta go
If there's any way I can help

[Verse 3: Drake]
Isn't it ironic that the girl I want to marry is a wedding planner
That tells me my life is too much and then moves to Atlanta
Damn, of all the places you could go
I just thought you'd choose somewhere
That had somebody that you know
I'm always up too late, I worry 'bout you there alone
In that place you call your home, warm nights and cold Patron
I hope you don't get known for nothing crazy
'Cause no man ever wants to hear those stories 'bout his lady
I know they say the first love is the sweetest
But that first cut is the deepest
I tried to keep us together, you were busy keeping secrets
Secrets you were telling everybody but me
Don't be fooled by the money, I'm still just young and unlucky
I'm surprised you couldn't tell

[Outro]
I was only trying to get ahead
I was only trying to get ahead
But the spotlight makes you nervous
And you're looking for a purpose
I was only trying to get ahead
I was only trying to get ahead
But the spotlight makes you nervous

[Intro: Eminem & 50 Cent]
Oh! Ladies and gentlemen
The moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults, and 4 murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world
Slim Shady! (Let's go!)

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

[Interlude: Eminem]
Okay, let's go!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Back with Andre the Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick fromunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man, they love me when I lay in the cut
Fisticuffs, the lady give her eighty-some paper cuts
Now picture us; it's ridiculous, you curse at the thought
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words, it's picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say we're the center of attention, it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so hence the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

[Break 1: Eminem]
Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre!

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
They see that low rider go by, they're like, "Oh my!"
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick 'cause I know why
I dip through in that Six-Trey like, "Sick 'em, Dre!"
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love L.A.
'Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Drivin' 'round with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino, or the El Dorado?
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco, beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

[Break 2: Eminem]
And I take great pleasure in introducing 50 Cent!

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thing when you party with me
It's what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the Don, I'm King Kong
Get rolled on, wrapped up, and reigned on
I'm so calm, through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marijuan', do what you want
Nigga, on and on 'til the break of what?
Get the paper, man, I'm cakin', you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothin'
Blow it like it's supposed to be blown, motherfucker, I'm grown
I stunt, I style, I flash the shit (Uh huh)
I gets what the fuck I want, so what I trick? (Yeah)
Fat-ass Birkin bags, some classy shit (Haha)
Jimmy Choo shoes; I say, "Move," a bitch move

[Chorus: Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
Oh-oh, oh-oh, bitches hoppin' in my Tahoe
Got one ridin' shotgun and no, not one of 'em got clothes
Now, where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of 'em
And there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kickin' up dust
It's on 'til the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

[Hook]

What's sunshine with no rain
What's joy without the pain
And I'm still gon' do my thing
There ain't no holding me back
Aye I'mma get mine, believe that
And what's sunshine with no rain
And what's joy without the pain

[Verse]

The city fucked up, even thug niggas getting robbed
Know it's bad when the drug dealers getting jobs
Same niggas who skipped out on graduation
At the gas station
Filling out them applications, but
They ain't calling me back
Best friends be our references
Paychecks spent on necklaces
Downpayments on them lexuses
Debit in the negative
Overdraft, with the sky overcast
But I'm screaming fuck the pessimists
Cause ain't no holding me back
The lil' nigga had big dreams, to do big things
But in this game, everything ain't what this shit seems
Try hard, to climb up to the flag-pole
Just to find out that your heroes is some assholes

[Hook] (x2)

But ain't no holding me back
I'mma get mine, believe that
Aye what's sunshine with no rain
Aye what's joy without the pain
Man I'm still gon' do my thang

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
They say I’m too fake, fuck it I’m paid
I can’t even find an empty spot inside my safe
I got Carties on my eyes, Louis on my case
Lobster, shrimp, and calamari right here chilling on my plate
They tell me I’m on time, even when I’m late
Even if it’s a lie they say everything is great
I’m grabbin’ the fattest asses, just to see ‘em shake
I swear I’m too real to be, I’m too real to be livin’ so fake

[Chorus]
Look out!
Cause I’m just too fake for the world
I know it’s just a game to me
I’m just too fake you see
I wish I didn’t have to be but watch out
I got too much soul for the world
It’s breaking my heart in two
I got too much soul for you
I don’t like it but it’s true

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
"Yeah I know Sean, I swear that nigga ain’t shit
Known him for forever and he ain’t on the same shit
It breaks my heart when all the kids be yelling 'You the mayne, Big'
He ain’t no hometown hero, he on that LeBron James shit"
Man I tell them suck my dick then choke on a nut
Cause when they see me it’s "Oh, It's Big, What's up?"
Man for the team, man, fam, or regime
Might knock down any door, open it up
Got on and now you startin’ actin’ different huh?
No really I wasn’t fuckin’ with you from the beginnin’ bruh
Here we are, here we go, my circle tighter than a Cheerio
People want a handle like silver spoons
People want a handout like here you go
Man, the realest nigga I know is inside the mirror bro
And these fools be trippin’ like a suitcase, a shoelace
They too fake, and I’m too real, yeah, boy

[Chorus]
Look out!
Cause I’m just too fake for the world
I know it’s just a game to me
I’m just too fake you see
I wish I didn’t have to be but watch out
I got too much soul for the world
It’s breaking my heart in two
I got too much soul for you
I don’t like it but it’s true

[Verse 3: Chiddy]
Fake it til you make it
What happens when you do?
Friends turn to strangers, so I’m a stranger, too
They want this or that
Boy gotta hustle like a flip or pack
Year a go a nigga wasn't gettin' scratch
When I hit the booth I came up with a sick attack
Oh yes, feelin’ so strong we about to take the game like Conquest
Wish we fail, but they check pre-sales, and a hater gets proven wrong, yes
They just bantering, calls I’m not answering
Married to the music so I never give a hand a ring
But Chiddy jigga with these girls we be on the next
And they get mad cause we really don’t respond to text
Yeah, they say I, may be just on the shady side
Maybe I, grow so much and I smoke so much got a lazy eye
Yeah I’m too gone, this the new shit to get loose on
The boy Chiddy and Sean on a new song
If you ain’t with it, tell me what the fuck you on
I said I in heads, made it off of Big chance
Yeah and still the game can make you fake like implant
But I'm real

[Intro: Mos Def & Swizz Beatz]
Yeah, yeah, there it go, there it is
This, is something special (uh-huh, yeah)
This, is something new (it's an amazing time)
This, is something special (look around)
This, is something new (the power of observation)

[Verse 1: Mos Def]
Marvels and frights and strange delights
Attributes, properties, disciplines and novelties
Ecstatic patterns in the calendar design
Wilderness tours, guided by and for the blind
Cool ruler standing still sweating through the shades
He knew those lights only grew bright to fade
Dead wrong pageantry, lottery and games
Sleight of hand provided by extravagant and fake
The carnival tilt bell the hustle for the age
They clutch what they covet, what must they give away?
Who was uninvited who was asked to come and stay?
Surprise, it's your life, it's your business anyway
So please, pardon these and such curious minds
Peace, safe passage, precious time hither and gone
The day of days, Yawm al-Qiyāmah
This tiny stone illuminated by a star
The only star so large, many more
To make our largest star show small, furthermore
The end is not the end no stop but a pause
And what we can witness isn't all there is at all
Custom mock of a scotch and pork chops
The passion, expansion, the order of the random
See the dreamers, see the sleepers
Why'd you wake them? Sweet Jesus
Enlighten the Earth, seek heaven first
Let's put in this work

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson & Swizz Beatz]
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord (this, is something special)
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord (this, is something new)
Lord, Lord (this, is something special)
Lord

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Her heels set the mood, where did you acquire those Alaïas?
When I met you I heard Jesus, bells, strings and the choir
I got lines that's better than niggas' albums, plural
The king of the urban make your shit sound rural
She said I hit it so deep she need a epidural
Them other niggas have you looking like a squirrel
Now that's nuts
I only hang with white boys that like black sluts
Tell them Plain Pat yo that track sucks, we ain't dissing you
But you in the position to play something for us to listen to
I'm trying to worry about my scratch minus the crabs
I ain't stopping for you niggas like yellow cabs
I got scripts so why we need a movie?
And if I'm a douche, then put me in your coochie
I swear they shoulda never gave these niggas loose leaf
And excuse me if I'm trapped by the boobies
Booby trap, holla back

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson & Swizz Beatz]
Lord, Lord (you know, AK on the lamp like what's that?)
Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord (huh? Click clack)
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord (this, is something special)
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord (this, is something new)
Lord

[Verse 3: Swizz Beatz]
All white Bentley, I call that mama
My life crazy, like Obama's
You talk slick? Well I'm Osama
Bin Laden, I'm what's happening, I get it cracking
All black Carbon, on my wrist, yeah
It's gonna take you a couple years to get this here
Thank AP, well they thank me
And I be mad too, if you ain't me
Call me Mr. Dean, or Mr. Boss
See me riding clean, in a Rolls Royce
Niggas talking funny, that's old money
Niggas looking crazy, but they talking funny
Nowadays rappers, they like bloggers
You see me? I'm a bank hogger
Coming through your hood, in a Brinks truck
With 25s on it like what the fuck?
100 feet and better, what the fuck you stick?
Paparazzi on the water with the fuck-you stick
My face got the "fuck you pricks"
My beats go hard like fuck you dicks
Pouring champagne damn thing
See me rocking suede, nigga, in the damn rain
Ain't a damn thing, money ain't a damn thing
Ask Yeezy and Mos, we do the goddamn thing

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson & Swizz Beatz]
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Get down with the precious leathers
Lord, Lord (this, is something special)
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord (this, is something new)
Lord, Lord (this, is something special)
Lord

[Verse 4: Raekwon]
Aiyyo, open glass on my fingers, I sit back like I'm caged
But still caking, my niggas is hating
It's like being in the livest Lambo in the hood
You a piece of steak, I'd rather be that than some bacon
Every project is a throne only just bigger stones they throw
That's why I wear a big hat and roll weed
Gone if you don't know where you came or when you came
All you know is weed and cocaine, nonbelievers no game
I'm zooted down, rolling a spliff, maxing
Flaming like wheels got traction, I'm sun, he's attractive
Guaranteed to service the real niggas out cruising in a Volvo
A duffle for dolo, buffy polo
A blow house is where I resided once
Live amongst fiends, counting currency, hitting blunts
Only to hear the door rumble, grab the 4
Hope it ain't the law or maybe some nigga trying to score

[Outro: Charlie Wilson]
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord (Lord)
L-Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord (Lord, Lord)
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord (Lord, Lord, Lord) Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord

Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord
Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, hahahah
That's kind of how this rap was pieced, hahahah
Most definitely this rap was pieced

[Intro]
I-I-I, am-am not a human being!

[Verse 1]
Uhh, pussy for lunch
Pop all the balloons and spit in the punch, haha
Yeah, kush in the blunts
I ride through your block, see a foot in the trunk
I don't know why they keep playing, they better re-plan
I'm giving 'em the blues, Bobby Blue Bland
Together we stand, and fall on y'all
Balling with my Bloods, call it B-ball
These dames ain't shit, Young Money is
I got Mars bars, 3 Musketeers
Come through, coupe same color as veneers
And you know I'm riding with the toast, cheers
Yeah, now I'm back on my grizz
And y'all's a bunch a squares like a mothafuckin' grid
Shit, fuck with me and get hid
I finger-fuck the Nina, make that bitch have kids
Just do it? My nigga, I just did
Ain't a motherfucker deeper than me, bitch, dig
You dig? This here, this big biz
And I scream, "Fuck it!" Whoever it is

[Chorus]
I am the rhyming oasis
I got a cup of your time, I won't waste it
I got my foot on the line, I'm not racing
I thank God that I am not basic
Oww! I-I am not basic
I-I-I, am-am not a human being!

[Verse 2]
Uhh, rockstar baby
Now come to my suite and get lockjaw baby
Rich nigga looking at the cops all crazy
That's that mob shit, nigga, Martin Scorsese
Heater close range, cause people are strange
But I bet that AK-47 keep you ordained
You can't see Weezy nor Wayne, I'm in the far lane
I'm running this shit, hundred yard gain
Uhh, swag on infinity
I'm killing 'em, see the white flag from the enemy
Shoot you in your head and leave your dash full of memories
Father forgive me for my brash delivery
I-I-I would try you, I wouldn't lie dude
I must be sticky cause them bitches got their eyes glued
Young Money, baby, we the shit, like fly food
Y'all can't see us, like the bride's shoes
I stand tall like I'm motherfucking 9'2"
I scream "Motherfuck you and whoever designed you!"
And if you think you hot then obviously you were lied to
And we don't die, we multiply, and then we come divide you

[Chorus]
I am the rhyming oasis
I got a cup of your time, I won't waste it
I got my foot on the line, I'm not racing
I thank God that I am not basic
I am not basic
I-I am not basic
I thank God that I am not basic
I-I-I, am-am not a human being!

[Verse 3]
Re-re-re-re-reporting from another world
Magazine full of bullets, you can be my cover girl
Bless got the weed rolling thicker than a Southern girl
Strong-arm rap like a nigga did a hundred curls
Rockstar biatch, check out how we rock
And if this ain't hip-hop, it must be knee-hop
I'm higher than a tree top, she lick my lollipop
I still get my candy from your girlfriend's sweet shop
Spitting that heat rock, I'm smooth, not Pete Rock
And my, and my money on et cetera, three dots
Still get a stomach ache every time I see cops
You better run motherfucker, cause we not
You better run 'til your feet stop
You ain't even a fucking alphabet in my teapot
Colder than a ski shop, holding on to the top
And even if I let go, I still won't d-rop

[Chorus]
I am the rhyming oasis
I got a cup of your time, I won't waste it
I got my foot on the line, I'm not racing
I thank God that I am not basic
I-I-I-I, I, I am not
I-I-I, am-am not a human being

[Intro]
Yessir!
What up Shinobi? Suzie, what up?
As-salaam alaikum, ugh, yeah
What up Chi-Town? What up, Westside?
What up, everywhere else in the world?
Haha! President Carter, what up?

[Verse]
Dear Fall! You might not know what my album is called
It's "Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor"
God willing, September is when I plan to fall
I mean drop like the temperature
Then rock on right through the winter
Put something on they mind, give em lines to remember
Aw! a lifetime remembered, which is mine
Then recorded, put it in Georges then rewind then look into
My mis-adventures, adventures into the Underworld
Hanging with them Cover Girls, this ain't my enter, nawww
On Arista, I coulda been a contender
But BMG had a different agenda
What up, LA Reid? I still see ya
You still my homeboy, won't even charge ya for a feature
I went from MC to being MS
That's "microphone controller" to "motivational speaker"
Niggas...
Astaghfirullah, I'm not a prophet
But Fahrenheit 1/15 is being quoted by preachers
Far from being a leader, but I'm still being invited by teachers
With no Hennessy, and no reefer
Give him a hand, I came from hand-me-down sneakers
And I don't wanna boast or brag
But for what most niggas hope, a nigga done had
Chop game with my folk and split it in half
You ain't gotta bring it back tomorrow, a nigga can have
Rich or broke, a nigga ain't mad
Self-esteem will make a Regal ride like a Silver Seraph
Just wipe the french fries off the seat
Lean back, and I tilt my hat, uh!
And nod my head to the baseline
Freebase to the 8 times at Baseline watching Jay put it together
I wonder if he knew
While he was mumbling that this would push Lupe forever
Together, with the FNF crew
Atlantic on post, proudly present to you, uh!
Some new, something fresh, something different
A lil to the left, a lil upliftin'
A lil good game, a lil hustlin' in it
Some SB Nikes, some nice crushed linen
Don't forget the skateboard, of course, the nice women
Can I get a mic check? And a lil light dimming?
And a fresh bottle of Voss, maybe with some light lemon?
And you gotta blame my momma for the lil light-skinning
And this ain't written, I swear, Autumn
I was just recording 'em as I thought em
A YG, FNF U-P
23-year-old VP
With a flow like Laudanum, that'll getcha sleepy
But soon as they nod off, that's when I smelling-salt 'em
What up, Madison Street?
How they gonna keep us off them? PEACE

[Intro]
West—Mr. West—Mr. West
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
And I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
From the Chi, like Tim, it's a harder way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise on the minimum wage?
And I know the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allāhu Akbar and throw in some hot cars
The things we seen on the screen is not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seeing cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars—I know it

[Chorus: Kanye West & Adam Levine]
Uh, and I heard 'em say (Ooh)
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
(Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today)
But we'll a find a way
And nothing lasts forever, but be honest, babe
It hurts, but it may be the only way

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
They say people in your life are seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun clapping and keep to squeezing
And Gran keep praying and keep believing
In Jesus, and one day that you see him
'Til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The devil is alive I feel him breathin'
Claiming money is the key, so keep on dreamin'
And put them lottery tickets just to tease us
My Aunt Pam can't put them cigarettes down
So now my little cousin smokin' them cigarettes now
His job try to claim that he too niggerish now
Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now?
I can't figure it out, I'm sick of it now

[Chorus: Kanye West & Adam Levine]
Ugh, and I heard 'em say (Ooh)
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today (Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today)
But we'll a find a way
And nothing last forever, but be honest, babe
It hurts, but it may be the only way

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
With every worthless word we get more far away
And nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And nothing lasts forever, but be honest, babe
It hurts but it may be the only way
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, woo-woo
Oh, ooh, ooh

[Outro: Kanye West]
Uh, yea, uh, yea, uh, yea

[Hook: Pharrell]
We've evolved from small to tall
And shall not stall, been flying too long
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa girl
I be sippin' on haterade
That deep-down getcha paid
It tastes like lemonade
Scrunch your face when you see me paid
I be sippin' on haterade
That deep-down getcha paid
That flavor is lemonade
Scrunch your face when you see me paid
You know what I'm talking about

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm not listening, I'm not interested
My attention only focused on what I get
Diamond’s glistening, they call me Mr. Check
White ice lemonade, Black ice she thick
I got general ambition, life's a bitch
So I treat it real good like hoes is squeezed
My whole life, I ain't never seen a car like that
And she probably won't see the next shit I get
And a seventeen fresh, I say I guess
Successful, healthy, I live no stress
So today is the day that the big boy shine
Drop tops everywhere, I wouldn't know how to rock
Got the titties out today showing off tan lines
Bands bending in my pocket, no it's not drumline
Me and Skateboard P in the club on time
No, not on time, but it just in time
(It's Gucci!)

[Hook: Pharrell]
We've evolved from small to tall
And shall not stall, been flying too long
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa girl
I be sippin' on haterade
That deep-down getcha paid
It tastes like lemonade
Scrunch your face when you see me paid
I be sippin' on haterade
That deep-down getcha paid
That flavor is lemonade
Scrunch your face when you see me paid
You know what I'm talking about

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Uh, yo, ayo, this one goes out to all of my critics
Don't you feel stupid? Look how I did it!
Look how it came to pass when I said it
We can do debit, I don't need no credit
Yes, I'm epic, look how I rep it
It's been eight years, but I broke the record
Yup, the record... yup, the record... yup, the record
(Just for the record)
Uh, I'm all that I can be
And I'll admit, I'm appalled when you envy
’Cause you can do it, too, and you can do it, too
I just happen to be the girl that they threw it to
So I'mma bounce back, and I'mma ball out
And every time that you see me I'mma go all out
And I'mma win till the ending
Don't be mad when you see me transcending... Gucc!

[Hook: Pharrell]
We've evolved from small to tall
And shall not stall, been flying too long
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa girl
I be sippin' on haterade
That deep-down getcha paid
It tastes like lemonade
Scrunch your face when you see me paid
I be sippin' on haterade
That deep-down getcha paid
That flavor is lemonade
Scrunch your face when you see me paid
You know what I'm talking about

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
I ball hard, I should be in Sports Illustrated
Cooler than a motherfucka in a Porshe lemonade coupe
Pull up in a Ferrari in your hood, get intimidated
Mutilated, Maserati, Lamborghini (are) decapitated
Feds investigation on what I accumulated, insinuated
That I'm not the man that I say I am
Like I I give a damn
But I just run around town pickin' up stacks
Some like Louis, some like Gucci
I love money, ya I love solutions
And my teenage karat ring, baby girl choosin
And I ain't hard to please baby come choose me
Lounge around, round the town with the top chopped off
You can call it lost and found ’cause my top stay down
And I ain’t seen a muthafucka since I bought this car
I ain’t seen a muthafucka since I bought the car
It’s Gucci!

[Hook: Pharrell]
We've evolved from small to tall
And shall not stall, been flying too long
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa girl
I be sippin' on haterade
That deep-down getcha paid
It tastes like lemonade
Scrunch your face when you see me paid
I be sippin' on haterade
That deep-down getcha paid

Scrunch your face when you see me paid
You know what I'm talking about

[Outro: Pharrell and (Gucci Mane)]
You know what I'm talkin' bout?
Go and lift your glass, go and lift your glass
(Let's think about the future and forget the past)
Everybody just lift ya glass, go and lift ya glass
(If a nigga kid hatin', tell 'em kiss ya ass)
Just lift ya glass, go and lift your glass
(Let's think about the future and forget the past)
Everybody just lift ya glass, go and lift ya glass
(If a nigga go hard, don't make me laugh, it's Gucci)

[Verse 1: John Legend]
Wake up everybody, no more sleeping in bed
No more backward thinking, time for thinking ahead
The world has changed so very much from what it used to be
There is so much hatred, war, and poverty

[Verse 2: Melanie Fiona]
Wake up all the teachers, time to teach a new way
Maybe then they'll listen to what you have to say
Cause they're the ones who's coming up, and the world is in their hands
When you teach the children, teach them the very best you can

[Hook: John Legend & Melanie Fiona]
The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it, yeah, just you and me

[Verse 3: John Legend]
Wake up all the doctors, make the old people well
They're the ones who suffer and who catch all the hell
But they don't have so very long before their Judgment Day
So won't you make them happy before they pass away

[Verse 4: Melanie Fiona]
Wake up, all the builders time to build a new land
I know we can do it if we all lend a hand
The only thing we have to do is put it in our mind
Surely things will work out, cause they do every time

[Hook: John Legend & Melanie Fiona]
The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it, yeah, just you and me

[Bridge Rap: Common]
It's the God hour, the morning I wake up
Just for the breath of life I thank my maker
My mom say I come from hustlers and shakers
My mind build-ed on skyscrapers and acres
He said take us back to where we belong
I try to write a song as sweet as the Psalms
Though I'm the type to bear arms and wear my heart on my sleeve
Even when I fell, in God I believe
Breathe the days in
Weave through the maze and the season so amazing
Feed them and raise them
Seasons are aging: earthquakes, wars, and rumors
I want us to get by but we're more then consumers
We're more than shooters, more than looters
Created in his image, so God live through us
And even in this generation living through computers
Only love, love, love can reboot us

[Outro]
Wake up, everybody
Wake up, everybody
Need a little help, y'all
Yes I do, need a little help

Need a little help, y'all ay
Wake up everybody
Wake up everybody
Wake up everybody

With a windshield full of tickets cause I live right by the station

[Verse 1]
These niggas is playing
Russian Roulette with a full clip, foolish
My crew is foolless, no, we don't dance
All we do is stay two steps ahead
Make the hoes get loose like a noose neck
Instead while these dudes beg for head
They got the game twisted, heavy traffic in this rap shit
Look how my lane shifted, elevated my game, lifted my name
Now these lame niggas could never get it
Like that bad bitch you wanted but could never hit it
Clever with it, my flow like a devil spit it and heaven sent it
So high, if I dropped I would fall for 11 minutes
So yeah, I operate on a higher plane, my thoughts take a higher train
It's dope, then you should know the suppliers name
It's J. Cole, set of horns and a halo
And all these Jose Canseco's wanna text us like Waco
Its hard to remain faithful niggas be throwing hate
Yo I'm in a league of my own so what the fuck would I play for?
Some next niggas almost slid in but didn't fit in
Naw I ain't Maury Povich but who the fuck is you kiddin?
These big wig niggas throwing their bid in
Try not to show stress, I guess the flow is protested like a sit in
I told my niggas we would get in
But that ain't even half the battle
Stay behind like a shadow or you catapult
Now if I had a ladder or now even if I had a rope
I'd climb that motherfucker to the top and never let it go!

[Chorus: Nas (Sampled) & J. Cole]
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me

[Verse 2]
Heaven or hell, you choose, freedom or jail, you lose
I can't stop, I'm as hot as the devils shoes
Overcame a low life status to blow like Gladys
Ahead of my time like I live my whole life backwards
I'm nothing like these ho-like rappers
My whole life practice to be the one
What's it like to be LeBron
They calling you the saviour, so much pressure but you deal with it
The weight of the world on your shoulders but you still lift it
Ill with it for real, lil nigga from Ville that real niggas can feel
Nobody taught us how to cook still niggas a grill
No Foreman, try not to call them ladies bees but them hoes swarmin
Now honey, aye is it destiny or is it money you're feelin
Heard rumors of a deal and now you thinkin a million
Pardon my paranoid mind but I'm starin in the mirror livin in fear that things a never be the same
No one left for me to blame but myself 'cause I asked for this
Headed for fame but in my brain, hey can I last in this?
Aye five years I'll probably laugh at this
Try not to let it wear me out like a bad bitch with fashion sense
I keep it fresh while these wack niggas rehash and shit
Jackin styles you know, ski mask and shit
I pass these niggas, they tryna do it how these other niggas did it
I'm tryna live it how no other nigga ever lived it

[Pre-Chorus: Nas (Sampled) & J. Cole]
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me
Dead fucking presidents to represent me
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me
Dead fucking presidents to represent me

[Chorus: Nas (Sampled)  & J. Cole]
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Get money)
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me

[Refrain: Swizz Beatz]
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I'm so appalled, Spalding, ball
Balding Donald Trump taking dollars from y'all
Baby, you're fired, your girlfriend hired
But if you don't mind, I'ma keep you on call
We above the law, we don't give a fuck 'bout y'all
I got dogs that'll chew a fuckin' hole through the wall
But since they all lovers, I need more rubbers
And if I don't use rubbers, need more covers
Housekeeping, I mean, goddamn
One time, let it be a bad bitch sweeping
That know we get O's like Cheerios
That know because they seen us in the videos
That know the day that you play me
Would be the same day MTV play videos
That was a little joke, voila
Praises due to the most high, Allah
Praises due to the most fly, Prada
Baby, I'm magic, tada
Address me as your highness, high as United
Thirty thousand feet up and you are not invited
Niggas be writing bullshit like they gotta work
Niggas is going through real shit, man, they out of work
That's why another goddamn dance track gotta hurt
That's why I'd rather spit something that got a purp'

[Chorus: Kanye West & CyHi The Prynce]
Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean this shit is fuckin' ridiculous
Fuckin' ridiculous
I mean this shit is fuckin' ridiculous
Five-star dishes, different exotic fishes
Man, this shit is fuckin' ridiculous
Fuckin' ridiculous

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
How should I begin this? I'm just so offended
How am I even mentioned by all these fuckin' beginners?
I'm so appalled, I might buy the mall
Just to show niggas how much more I have in store
I'm fresher than you all, so I don't have to pause
All of y'all can suck my balls through my drawers
Dark Knight feeling, die and be a hero
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
I went from the favorite to the most hated
But would you rather be underpaid or overrated?
Moral victories is for minor league coaches
And Ye already told you we major, you cockroaches
Show me where the boats is, Ferrari Testarossas
And Hammer went broke so you know I'm more focused
I lost thirty mil', so I spent another thirty
'Cause unlike Hammer, thirty million can't hurt me
Fuckin' insane, the fuck am I saying?
Not only am I fly, I'm fuckin' not playing
All these little bitches too big for they britches
Burning they little bridges, fuckin' ridiculous

[Chorus: Kanye West & CyHi The Prynce]
Champagne wishes, thirty white bitches
I mean this shit is fuckin' ridiculous
Fuckin' ridiculous
I mean this shit is fuckin' ridiculous
Five-star dishes, different exotic fishes
Man, this shit is fuckin' ridiculous
Fuckin' ridiculous

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
Success is what you make it, take it how it come
A half a mil' in twenties like a billion where I'm from
An arrogant drug dealer, the legend I become
CNN said I'd be dead by twenty-one
Blackjack, I just pulled an ace
As you looking at the king in his face
Everything I dream, motherfuckers, I'm watchin' it take shape
While to you I'm just a young rich nigga that lacks faith
Range Rove', leather roof, love war, fuck a truce
Still move a bird like I'm in bed with Mother Goose
Them hoes coming in a baker's dozen
Claiming they was with me when they know they really wasn't
I keep the city's best, never said she was the brightest
So if you had her too, it don't affect me in the slightest
I never met a bitch that didn't need a little guidance
So I dismiss her past until she disappoints your highness
I speak the gospel, hostile
Tony doing time for what he did to nostrils
Paranoid mind, I'm still under the watchful
Eye of the law, aspire for more
Them kilos came, we gave you Bobby Brown jaw
Flaws ain't flaws when it's you that makes the call
Flow similar to the legends of the falls
Spillin', I own you all, yuugh

[Refrain: Swizz Beatz]
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous

[Verse 4: CyHi The Prynce]
Hah, I am so outrageous
I wear my pride on my sleeve like a bracelet
If God had an iPod, I'd be on his playlist
My phrases amazes the faces in places
The favorite, hah, my cup overrunneth with hundreds
Dummy, damn, it's hard not for me to waste it
The new Commandment, "Thou shalt not hate, kid"
My movement is like the Civil Rights, I'm Ralph David
Abernathy, so call my lady Rosa Parks
I am nothing like them niggas, baby, those are marks
I met this girl on Valentine's Day, fucked her in May
She found out about April, so she chose to march
Hah, damn, another broken heart
I keep bitches by the twos, nigga, Noah's Ark
I got a seven on me, I call my 'dro Lamar
Plus a Trojan in my pocket, Matt Leinart, hah
G-A-T in the Pathfinder
'Cause you haters got PhDs
Y'all just some major haters and some math minors
Tiger Woods, don't make me grab iron

[Chorus: RZA]
Ayy, yo, champagne wishes and thirty white bitches
You know this shit is fuckin' ridiculous
Fuckin' ridiculous
You know this shit is fuckin' ridiculous
Cars for the missus and furs for the mistress
You know that shit is fuckin' ridiculous
Fuckin' ridiculous
You know this shit is fuckin' ridiculous
Fuckin' ridiculous
Fuckin' ridiculous
Fuckin' ridiculous

[Refrain: Swizz Beatz]
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Two hands in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, I mean ridiculous
It's like that sometimes, this shit ridiculous
One hand in the air if you don't really care
Middle finger in the air if you don't really care
It's like that sometimes, man, ridiculous
Life can be sometimes ridiculous, huh?

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Shawty badder than a three-year-old
Keep playing and I'ma eat her like a pita roll
I'm just saying, with my love I could feed her soul
Two-day getaway and we don't need our clothes
We at the pool and she looking like a center fold
Two tattoos but she say she getting plenty mo
She got Indian in her family, Seminole
Me and shawty go together like chemicals
And she get mad when I call other women hoes
You send her rose, I pick some flowers and send her those
Tall glass of Merlot get her in the mode
Two tall glasses of Merlot get her out her robe
I whisper in her ear then lick round her lobe
And when she check her watch, it’s never time to go
And with her brain she should make the honor roll
And when I came she caught me like a common cold

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Damn you the shit
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I don't really know how to handle this shit
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit

[Chorus: Drake]
With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you and only you

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I say damn I must be left
'Cause you the best I ever seen, right
Shawty put me on, you got me going like some green lights
See you with your girls, they probably telling you that he ain't right
Bet they be the same bitches at the wedding throwing rice
Let's get together over night
Shawty I'm a pro and you are looking like the prototype
Ms. Cita, I took your advice
Sometimes you got to blow it twice then shake it up and roll the dice
I'm cruising on the road of life but I need a passenger
Appetite for loving, ma I'm hungry like a scavenger
I be on that lavender
I be in the bath with her
Then I gotta go under that water like a mariner

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Damn you the shit
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I don't really know how to handle this shit
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit

[Chorus: Drake]
With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you and only you

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Now she don't know about me but I'ma put her on it
And she ain't sure about me but can't go without me
We probably ain't supposed to be together
But I wonder if our love affair could last forever
And shawty I'm with you
Smoke a lot of weed but I could never forget you
Then I told her to her face
If everyone was like you, the world would be a better place

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Damn you the shit
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I don't really know how to handle this shit
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit

[Chorus: Drake]
With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you and only you

[Bridge: Drake]
Damn you the shit
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I don't really know how to handle this shit
But tonight

[Chorus: Drake]
With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you and only you

[Verse 1]
Skinny ass pants, fresh pair of Vans
If them niggas keep tripping they can share an ambulance
Throw up blood with my hands
My gang popping niggas
Smoke that Kiesha, not that Reggie
For you name dropping niggas
All day I do it, I do it like Tony
Got a sign on my dick that say "Bad Bitches Only"
I don't drink champagne, it make my stomach hurt
Man I'm on that Patron, fuck with me wrong and get murked
Got a silencer on the gun, that bitch go pew
Got a mean ass swagger, my bitches do too
Yeah all my niggas nuts and I'm a loose screw
Bitch I get big bucks, pockets on Bruce Bruce
Yeah I talk that shit, bitch I got bread, bitch I got toast
Welcome to The Murder Show — I am the motherfucking host
They call me Weezy F. Baby, yes I do the fucking most
I'm at their throats until they choke
The God has spoke
I need a smoke break
(Smoke break…)

[Chorus 1]
Now let it breathe, Tune
It go; all these bitches, and niggas still hating
I used to be balling, but now I'm Bill Gating
Got a list full of problems
I'll tend to them later
Yeah, life is a bitch, but I appreciate her, man
All these bitches and niggas still hating
Yeah I used to be balling, but now I'm Bill Gating
Got a list full of problems
I'll tend to them later
Yeah, life is a bitch, but I appreciate her, man

[Verse 2]
It go; dark-ass shades, I can't see them haters
Now eat these fucking bullets, don't forget to tip the waiter
Dress like a skater, ride on you like Shaun White
I'm high all day, you can call that shit a long flight
Every night's a long night, every day's a holiday
I don't fuck with squares, now do that mean I'm out of shape?
Yes I talk shit, got to defecate to conversate
Weezy fuck the world, yep I fuck it 'til it ovulate
Get her to the crib, get in that pussy and just dominate
Weezy F. Baby and the 'F' is for fornicate
Polo Ralph Lauren, bitch, that's what my pajamas say
Big tall glass of some shit you can't pronounciate
Boogers in the bezel of my watch with the vomit face
And still I do not give you motherfuckers the time of day
Pistol in your mouth, I can not make out what you trying to say
And if they want a war
Then tell them motherfuckers "Bombs away"

[Chorus 2]
Man, all these bitches, and niggas still hating
Man, I used to be balling, but now I'm Bill Gating
Got a list full of problems — I'll tend to 'em later
And life is a bitch, but I appreciate her
Man, all these bitches, and niggas still hating
And I used to be balling, but now I'm Bill Gateing
Got a list full of problems — I'll tend to 'em later
Man, life is a bitch, but I appreciate her

[Outro]
Let it breathe tune
Just let it breathe tune, yeah
Young, Young Mula, baby
Young Mula, baby
Young, Young Mula, baby
Just let it breathe tune

[Intro]
Yo yo yo yo yo (this is)
This is my motherfuckin' anthem (hip-hop)
To hip-hop music (anthem)
'Cause I'ma keep doin' hip-hop music
Until the day that I die (Until the motherfuckin' day that I die)
Aight, bitch?

[Verse 1]
Yo, I'm into voodoo, tarot cards and Ouija boards
Lightin' candles campin' out at haunted beach resorts
I write the dark shit, and rap about perverted violence
Ghost stories of people murdered on deserted islands
Dressed in jean shorts, high tops and tube socks
Holdin' a rifle, with a life full of drama like 2Pac's
Jumpin' off rooftops drunk after I do shots
Landin' in someone's backyard gettin' chewed up by two rots
I got a new watch and two rings with huge rocks
This rap shit got cash comin' out the blue like nude cops
I use to sell pizzas, now I got twelve visas
So tell Jesus that I'ma quit sinnin' when hell freezes

[Hook]
That's why my brain is out of order
That's probably why my nights are gettin' colder and my days seem shorter
But as the world turns and I keep growin' older
I'll be livin' this hip-hop till hell freezes over
Bitch, till hell freezes over
I'll be livin' this hip-hop till hell freezes over
And as the world turns and I keep growin' older
I'll be livin' this hip-hop till hell freezes (over)

[Verse 2]
Yo, I used to be too heavy in that cruising Gratiot crap
I think I fucked my head up listenin' to acid rap
I go to parties bumpin' Nasty Nas's new song
And smoke pot 'til I get high and stare at shit for too long
Like this weed is laced, ain't it? It tastes tainted
The whole place fainted, I woke up with my face painted
Spaced out like Sci-Fi TV, "Fuck ICP, buy my CD!" (Yeah)
That's what I'm screamin' while I'm handin' out promo tapes of my debut
Tellin' bitches, "Let me eat your pussy while I shave you!"
Ain't no shame in my game, I turn the party out
Makin' everybody shout for the rapper with potty mouth

[Hook]
That's why my brain is out of order
That's probably why my nights are gettin' colder and my days seem shorter
But as the world turns and I keep growin' older
I'll be livin' this hip-hop till hell freezes over
Bitch, till hell freezes over
I'll be livin' this hip-hop till hell freezes over
And as the world turns and I keep growin' older
I'll be livin' this hip-hop till hell freezes over

[Outro]
Uh (Uh-uh, uh uh-uh, uh uh)
Uh uh-uh uh uh
Ah ah-ah ah ah
Uh uh-uh uh uh
Ah ah-ah ah ah
Uh uh-uh uh uh (Dr. Dre)
Ah ah-ah ah ah
(Slim Shady)
(Outsidaz)

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
Uh, was always smartmouthed and quick-witted
But somethin' was always missin' like six digits, lucky seven
Probably poppa, little nigga so they picked on him, hassled him
Things changed when I hassled back, so, David hit the pavement
With this grapple rap, Snapple fact: you rather wack
While I am poppin' like a snappin' crack
So high you could see like Tallahass, the opposite of cataracts
Matter fact I am Farmer John milkin' cattle tracks
Action packed nipple squeezin', boy colder than sniffle season
Simple genius, go hard and spit bits of semen
So when the street is split, don't act surprised, agree with it
The gang of wolves that creeps in crypts
As deep as Dawson's Creek and shit
I pray they got gills either that or grab some floaties
I know I got skills, why you think I'm posted boastin'?
Braggin', tell these faggots to stop naggin'
'Cause them Wolf Gang niggas threw them off the bandwagon like

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Uh, was always fucked up as shit with it
But I didn't cross the line until the bridge hit it, troll
I got you niggas nervous like virgins flirtin' with Uncle Mervin
Fuckin' y'all with no lubricant, go grab the detergent
I preach to demons at your church, now I'm the newest sermon
Wearin' nothin' but they fuckin' blast with the matchin' turban
I drive through white suburbans in the black Suburban swervin'
Hittin' curbs and blastin' Erick Sermon, drunk off English bourbon
I'm stealin' purses, rapin' nurses, I'm a crooked surgeon
And treat the beat like sanitized Nazi puss, I'm a German
I'm squirtin' while I'm masturbatin' and regurgitatin'
From eatin' Miley Cyrus salad pussy platter they were servin'
My only purpose is to jerk it cause it has a curve
So bitches hate to do me like ex-convict community service
This my Zombie Circus, you better get a fuckin' ticket
Odd Future Wolf Gang, like they're filmin' Twilight in this bitch

[Verse 3: Earl Sweatshirt]
I'm back on my sixty six sick shit
Flowin' like the blood out the competition's slit wrists
She lick it up, Dracula, then spit it back, back at ya
She mad as fuck, stuck in the back of a black Acura
Fed her acid now the duct tape quacks back at her
Hello Heather yellow feathers, now you ain't laughin', huh?

[Verse 4: Tyler, The Creator]
Bitch, you're barely breathin', leavin' on the back of the boat
While I fill you up with semen from the Wolf Gang team and
Flowin' like the creampie inside of your daughter
Oughta eat the bitch with salt and wash it down with a gallon of water
I grab the saw and sawed her arm off and auctioned it
And dip her teeth in gold molds and flossed the shit
Fuckin' awesome, spittin' box of trees, got you niggas
Shakin' like it's Parkinsons from the clitoris of Kelly Clarkson's dick
Ironin' you niggas now it's time to starch the shit
Drown your bitch in a tub of cum and throw a shark in it
Find a random abandoned garage and go to park in it
Find Earl laying on the burgundy carpet, pull my knife out
Sharpen it, stab him, put a arch on it
Pour unleaded gas on him, get the Zippo and spark the shit
Hop back in the van and then depart the bitch
Killed him on his own track, the faggot shouldn't have started it

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
Yo, I'm a hot and bothered astronaut
Crashing while jacking off
To buffering vids of Asher Roth eating apple sauce
Sent to Earth to poke Catholics in the ass with saws
And knock blunt ashes into their caskets, and laugh it off
Twisted, sicker than mad cattle, in fact I'm off
Six different liquors, with a Prince wig plastered on
Stop screaming, bitch, you shouldn't be that alarmed
When Big Lips is in the attic, armed with an addict's arm
Earl puts the "ass" in "assassin"
Puts the pieces of decomposing bodies in plastic
Puts them in a pan and mixes it up with scat
Then gobbles it like fat black bitches and catfish
It so happens that I'm so haphazardous
I'll puke a piece and put it on a hook and fucking cast the shit
I'm askin' that you faggot rap actors take action
And get a hall pass for this class-act shit
How the fuck I fit an axe in a satchel?
Slip capsules in a glass, she dizzy rascal
Party staff baffled, asking where her ass go
In my room, redefining the meaning of black holes
Go on, suck it up; but hurry, I got nuts to bust
And butts to fuck and ups to shut and sluts to fuckin' uppercut
It's O.F., buttercup, go ahead, fuck with us
Without a doubt, a sure-fire way to get your mother fucked
Ask her for a couple bucks, shove a trumpet up her butt
Play a song, invade her thong
My dick is having guts for lunch, as well as supper
Then I'll rummage through her ruptured cunt
Found the mustard
Fucking nosey neighbors notice something's up
"What you doing?" – nothing much
Would shout some other stuff
Got to fucking bounce, guess the bouncer's had enough of us

[Interlude: Taco]
Fuck 2DopeBoyz
Eat my dick, I'll eat ya ass!
Fuck 2DopeBoyz, fuck them niggas man

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
Get up off the pavement, wipe the dirt and vomit off
DopeBoyz hating, but them faggots is a lot of talk
Cotton soft pussy, them Odd niggas is Molotov
Cocktails; fucking toss one in your apartment, dog
Wolf Gang, we ain't barking, nah
Try talking on a blog with your fucking arms cut off
Put in a carpet and watch it get auctioned off
The Ace tell Shake's daughter
"We're sorry, but papa's gone, bitch!"

[Outro: Tyler, The Creator]
Odd Future Wolf Gang, nigga
Fuck them 2DopeBoyz niggas
Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill 'Em All, don't give a fuck nigga
Litter Life nigga, stay pop nigga, what's good?
Earl, what up nigga?
Fuck Steve Harvey!

[Intro: Drake]
R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are over, baby she's over
I've decided to give you all of me
Baby, come closer, baby, come closer
I'm ready for ya

[Verse 1: Drake]
Kill 'em all, switch it up
Put it on, zip it up
Let my perfume, soakin' in your sweater
Say you'll be here soon, sooner the better
No options for, you sayin' no
I run this game, just play your role
Follow my lead, what you waitin' fo'?
Thought it over and decided tonight is the night

[Interlude: Nneka]
Ca-ha-han, you, fee-hee-heel, my, ha-ha-ha-ha-heart, is, beat-ing
Ca-ha-han, you, fee-hee-heel, my, ha-ha-ha-ha-heart, is, beat-ing

[Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, I hear you talkin', don't know who you tryna flatter
Got my mind made up, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I'm in control, but with you bein' a man
You don't seem to understand that I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, so keep thinkin' you're the man
'Cause it's all part of my plan, I-I, I'm ready for ya

[Post-Chorus: Drake]
Nothin' on, I strut around
I do it big, I shut it down
I wonder if you'll be able to handle me
Mental pictures, no cameras please

[Interlude: Nneka]
Ca-ha-han, you, fee-hee-heel, my, ha-ha-ha-ha-heart, is, beat-ing
Ca-ha-han, you, fee-hee-heel, my, ha-ha-ha-ha-heart, is, beat-ing

I-oh-oh-oh, so keep thinkin' you're the man
'Cause it's all part of my plan, I-I, I'm ready for ya

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uhh, red lipstick on the wine glass, cameras in my mind flash
Black lingerie, white diamonds, what a contrast
I know you get impatient as the time pass
You say you wanted fast? Define fast
'Cause I could speed it up and make it last
And I could audition for this and I could be part of the cast
And I could produce for your future, I could co-direct your past
And make damn sure that you never forget it, committed
I'm ready, I'm wit it, still here like a statue
Pink champagne, green ink in your tattoos
You say you got baggage, well I'm packed too
Plus I got a sex pistol pointed right at you
Bang! The baddest woman ever in the heart of South
Proven over and over again, that's why I'm hard to doubt
Plus I'm Young Money 'til the death, I took the Carter route
I'm more than ready too
Hope it's somethin that you thought about

[Interlude: Nneka]
Ca-ha-han, you, fee-hee-heel, my, ha-ha-ha-ha-heart, is, beat-ing
Ca-ha-han, you, fee-hee-heel, my, ha-ha-ha-ha-heart, is, beat-ing

Yeah, I hear you talkin', don't know who you tryna flatter
Got my mind made up, I-I, I'm ready for ya

You don't seem to understand that I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, so keep thinkin' you're the man

I-I-I-I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya
I-oh-oh-oh, so keep thinkin you're the man
'Cause it's all part of my plan
I-I, I'm ready for ya

[Intro: Mark Avery & Eddie]
Meet Eddie, 23 years old
Fed up with life and the way things are going
(Damn, I'm going fucking insane)
He decides to rob a liquor store
(I gotta take this shit, I can't take it no more, holmes)
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart
(Shit is mine)
And suddenly (I gotta do this)
His conscience comes into play (I gotta do this)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre, Eminem, & (Eddie)]
Alright, stop (Huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (Who are you?)
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience
That's nonsense
Go in, gaffle the money, and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress and one of her blond wigs
(Can I borrow this?)
Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades
Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns
Fuck that, do that shit, shoot that bitch
Can you afford to blow this shit? Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it (You're right)
Not over this shit (Stop)
Drop the biscuit (I will)
Don't even listen to Slim, yo, he's bad for you
You know what, Dre? I don't like your attitude

[Skit: Stan, Girl]
Come on, just come in here for a minute
I don't know
Look, look, look
Damn
Look, it's gonna be alright, alright?
O-okay
Look, give me a kiss, pull your pants off, come on

[Interlude: Mark Avery]
Meet Stan, 21 years old
After meeting a young girl at a rave party
Things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom
Once again, his conscience comes into play

[Verse 2: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Now, listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
And smearin' her lipstick, slip this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, it's not fair
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair? (Uh-huh)
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot, bare
'Til she passes out and she forgot how she got there
Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie Kids?
No, but I seen the porno with Sun Doobiest
Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?
Man, fuck that, hit that shit raw dog, then bail

[Interlude: The Isley Brothers, Mark Avery, (Grady), & Grady's Wife]
Here I lay
(Man, it feels good to be home)
Meet Grady, a 29-year-old construction worker
After coming home from a hard day's work
He walks in the door of his trailer park home
To find his wife in bed with another man
(What the fuck?) Grady

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
Alright, calm down, relax, start breathin'
Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'
While you at work, she's with some dude tryna get off
Fuck slittin' her throat, cut this bitch's head off
Wait, what if there's an explanation for this shit?
What, she tripped, fell, landed on his dick?
Tsh, alright, Shady, maybe he's right, Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
Okay, thought about it? Still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?
What you say?
What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?
I'ma kill you, motherfucker
Uh-uh, temper, temper
Mr. Dre, Mr. N.W.A, Mr. AK
Comin' straight outta Compton, y'all better make way
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?
'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that
Aw, fuck it, what am I sayin'?
Shoot 'em both, Grady, where's your gun at?

[Produced by Eminem & Jeff Bass]

[Intro: Eminem]
People, it-it feels so good to be back!
La-ladies and gent-gentleman-gentleman
Introdu-du-ducing the new-new and improved-proved you-you know who-who

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Never been the type to bend or budge
The wrong button to push, no friend of Bush
I'm the centerpiece, you're a Maltese
I'm a pit bull off his leash, all this peace talk can cease
All these people I had to leave in limbo
I'm back now, I've come to release this info
I'll be brief, and let me just keep shit simple
Cani-bitch don't want no beef with Slim, no!
Not even on my radar
So won't you please jump off my dick, lay off and stay off?
And follow me as I put these crayons to chaos
From séance to séance, aw-a-aw-ch-a-aw

[Chorus: Eminem]
Come on now! Let's all get on down!
Do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, ‘cause there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout
Let your hair down and square dance with me!
Come on now! Let's all get on down!
Do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, ‘cause there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout
Let your hair down and square dance with me!

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Yeah, let your hair down to the track, yeah, kick on back (Boo!)
The boogie monster of rap, yeah, the man's back
With a plan to ambush this Bush administration
Mush the Senate's face and push this generation
Of kids to stand and fight for the right to say somethin'
You might not like, this white hot light
That I'm under, no wonder I look so sunburnt
Oh no, I won't leave no stone unturned
Oh no, I won't leave, won't go nowhere
Do-si-do, oh, yo, ho, hello there!
Oh yeah, don't think I won't go there
Go to Beirut and do a show there (Haha!)
Yeah, you laugh 'til your mothafuckin' ass gets drafted
While you're at band-camp thinkin' that crap can't happen
'Til you fuck around, get an Anthrax napkin
Inside a package, wrapped in Saran Wrap wrappin'
Open the plastic and then you stand back, gaspin'
Fuckin' assassins hijackin' Amtraks, crashin'
All this terror, America demands action
Next thing you know, you've got Uncle Sam's ass askin'
To join the army or what you'll do for their Navy
You just a baby gettin' recruited at 18
You're on a plane now, eatin' they food and their baked beans
I'm 28, they gon' take you 'fore they take me
Crazy insane or insane crazy?
When I say, "Hussein," you say, "Shady"
My views ain't changed, still inhumane, wait
Arraigned two days late, the date's today, hang me!

[Chorus: Eminem]
Come on now! Let's all get on down!
Do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, ‘cause there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout
Let your hair down and square dance with me!
Come on now! Let's all get on down!
Do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, ‘cause there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout
Let your hair down and square dance with me!

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Nothin' moves me more than a groove that soothes me
Nothin' soothes me more than a groove that boosts me
Nothin' boosts me more or suits me beautifully
There's nothin' you can do to me, stab me, shoot at me! (Woo-hoo!)
Psychotic, hypnotic product, I got a the antibiotic
Ain't nobody hotter and so on and yada-yada
God, I talk a lot of hem-de-lay-la-la-la
Oochie-walla-walla, um-da-dah-da-dah-da, but you gotta-gotta
Keep movin', there's more music to make
Keep makin' new shit, produce hits to break
The monotony, what's gotten into me?
Drugs, rock and Hennessy, thug like I'm Pac, on my enemies
On your knees, got you under siege
Somebody you would give a lung to be
Hun-ga-ry like a fuckin' younger me
Fuck the fee, I can get you jumped for free
Yeah, buddy, laugh! It's funny, I have the money
To have you killed by somebody who has nothin'
I'm past bluffin', pass the K-Y
Let's get ready for some intense serious ass-fucking!

[Chorus: Eminem]
Come on now! Let's all get on down!
Do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, ‘cause there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout
Let your hair down and square dance with me!
Come on now! Let's all get on down!
Do-si-do now! We gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared, ‘cause there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout
Let your hair down and square dance with me!

[Outro: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Dr. Dre wants to square dance with me
Nasty Nas wants to square dance with me
X to the Z wants to square dance with me
Busta Rhymes wants to square dance with me
Cani-bitch won't square dance with me
Fan-a-bitch won't square dance with me
Canada-bis don't want no parts of me
Dirty Dozen wants to square dance with you
Yeehaw! Wee!

Throw a lot of money at her then yell

Then I'mma go get my Louisville Slugger
Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'm really such a lady

[Verse]
Catch me I'm balling, catch me I'm balling
Catch me like Spalding, catch me like Rawlings
If he indeed the MC, vitamin like GNC
Can't see me like BIG on CMT
Did a little bit of time on BMG
But this right here homie, this all me
Can you be down, nah, nigga C.M.B
That's cold, that ain't nice G
So what though, little homie remind me of Ice-T
By the way we share the same birthday
The word play is work but pimping is easy
So catch me I'm balling
I'm sick too if you ain't catch me like coughing
Back when I said you should catch me like Rawlings
It's cool, cause most cats that I bump into can't catch me that often
Most times they just end up falling
Ball for a few then end up walking
Catch me in the ball with a Cinderella waltzing
And I do it until it's no longer exclusive
Might go once, might go twice
But never three times like an auction to it
See I, walk into it, I do my thang
And tell a homie that it's cool to let y'all into it

[Intro: Girl on answering machine]
Hi, baby
I know you're under a lot of pressure at your work and all
And I do understand
You have no idea how much I understand
But you also don't have any idea how much I love you
I love you so much
I think about you I feel you in my arms
I miss you... I miss you terribly
I've just always wanted someone like you in my life
I love you so much that I'd do anything
I'd do anything
I'll be your perfect woman for you

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I just wanna fuck bad bitches
For all them nights I never had bitches
Now I'm all up in that ass, bitches
Mad at your boyfriend, ain't 'cha?
You'se a bad girl, gotta spank ya
And gotta thank ya for that head clinic
Explicit, hella photogenic
And tell your friends where the dick's at
Where they can get hit and won't get back to they soulmate
Before you kiss 'em, use Colgate
She swallowed it, yeah, the bitch took the whole eight
And ran with it, then let Mel-Man hit it
And Hittman hit it; damn, bitches
Man, this is what I'm talkin' 'bout
Chicken head, chicken fed, with a dick in your mouth
Out and about with your nigga like it never took place
(AirTouch me) Next time you need a taste

[Chorus: Devin the Dude]
I just wanna fuck you
No touchin' and rubbin', girl
You've got a husband who loves you
Don't need you all in mine
I just wanna fuck you
We can't be kissin' and huggin', girl
You've got a husband who loves you
You need to give him your quality time

[Verse 2: Devin the Dude]
You got the number, it's on you to make the call
You know I come quick, help you redecorate your walls
Cut your backyard, don’t have to act hard to get the cock
And if I'm going too far, I take it out and wipe it off
And put it back up, and keep going
You tryin' to hide it from your husband, but I know he be knowin'
That your pussy's been tampered with
Did you show him that new trick
Of how you can make it smoke a cancer stick?
You be workin' it like a dancer, bitch; it's hard on me
Not to give you all of my time that you wanted
You can give me some head, but keep the breakfast in bed
I'd rather spend my morning diggin' through some records instead
But tonight, I guess it'd be aight if we can touch bases
Hook up somewhere and exchange some Fuck Faces
I know your man's looking for ya, he's always trying to run ya
Don't worry 'bout me handcuffin', girl, 'cause I just wanna

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Fuck witchu on the sneak tip, on some creep shit
So whatcha gon' do, you freak bitch?
You acting like you don't do dicks
That's the kinda bitch I hate fuckin' with
Baby was a virgin, that's what she said
So I gave her some Hennessy, she gave me some head
I fucked her on the floor so I wouldn't mess up my bed
Then Lil' ½ Dead put his dick on her head
Take that bitch home and give her a bone
And give her the number to my cellular phone
Now she's blowin' up my pager, the shit's gettin' major
A favor for a favor, this dick is what I gave her
Somethin' to go by and bitches know why
Stuff dick in they mouth and then I'm out (See ya!)
24/7, Dre, Snoop and Devin
We servin' these hoes and never lovin' these hoes, biatch

[Chorus: Devin the Dude]
I just wanna fuck you
No touchin' and rubbin', girl
You've got a husband who loves you
Don't need you all in mine
I just wanna fuck you
We can't be kissin' and huggin', girl
You've got a husband who loves you
You need to give him your quality time

[Intro: Xzibit]
Yeah, time to bring your ass to the table, y’all
It’s X to the Z, Xzibit, yeah
Snoop double D, uh, OG
(Where you at? West Coast, Los Angeles)
What
Bringin' it live, Dr. Dre, what
Throwin' up a big ass W
Coverin' up the world, right
Yeah, ha
Listen, look

[Verse 1: Xzibit]
You ain't tryna hot box with me, I swig hard liquor
Goin' down by the second round, all hail the underground
How that sound? Xzibit backin' down from a conflict
Fuck the nonsense! Terrorist, here to bomb shit
Glass and metal in every direction
Innocent bystanders taught a very hard lesson
I'm the reason there's no time to reach for that weapon
And reason why niggas with problems keep on steppin'
Xzibit ready to scrap like Mike Tyson with his license back
9 to 5 minimum wage? What type of life is that?
For me? It's blasphemy, you fuckin' around
With the Sundance Kid and Butch Cassidy
You had the audacity to wanna tangle with the X
Strangle your neck, slap you like the opposite sex
Drunk drivin', tryna stack my loot
While other rappers gettin' Treated Like a Prostitute
So check the SoundScan

[Interlude: Snoop Dogg]
All I wanna be was a G, ha!
My whole life, nigga please, ha!
Breakin' off these motherfuckin' keys, ha!
Let's get these motherfuckin' G's, ha!
Nigga, you don't wanna fuck with this

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Hmm, oh no, big Snoop Dogg
Back up in the heezy, baby
You jockin' my style? You so crazy
Dre say, ain't "No Limit" to this
As long as we drop gangsta shit
Look here bitch, you fine and I dig your style
Come fuck with a nigga and do it doggy style
I'll be gentle, sentimental
Shit, we fucked in the rental
Lincoln Continental
Coast-to-coast, L.A. to Chicago

[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]
(Yeah, nigga, you know what's happenin', man) I get this pussy everywhere that I go
(These bitches know what time it is) Ask the bitches in your hood 'cause they know (Hell yeah)
(Hoes know about a nigga like me, man) I get this pussy everywhere that I go
(I pimp these hoes, nigga, ha-ha) Ask the bitches in your hood 'cause they know

[Verse 3: Xzibit]
Bitch please! Get down on your god damn knees
For this money, chronic, clothes and weed (Look)
Look, you fuckin' with some real O.G's, bitch please
Bitch please, get down on your motherfuckin' knees
We came to get the motherfuckin' cheese
Yeah, you fuckin' wit' some real OG's, you dick tease

[Verse 4: Snoop Dogg]
Bitch, please! Now what you need to do is
Hem my coat, and roll me some dope (Fo' real)
Different strokes (Huh-uh) for different folks
Oh, you like settin' niggas up and gettin' them locs?
A cute lil' bitch with a whole lotta heart
Shit gets thick when the light gets dark
She say she got a lick for me (Well, hook it up)
Worth about 200 G's and 30 ki's!
Now check this out, Dre: now, if I don't move
Then a nigga like me, shit, I don't lose
But you know me, Dogg, I'm movin'!
Ain't nothing to it but to get to groovin'
You've been waitin' on a nigga like me (What's that?)
To take that chance and rob your man and beat up the pussy
A victim of the circumstance
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
See we go out with a bang (Bang, bang)
I'm tryin' to work this cold thang
And take this whole thang

[Bridge: Snoop Dogg]
I get the money everywhere that I go (I go)
I bust a bitch and take her money fo' sho (Fo' sho)
I get the money everywhere that I go (I go)
I bust a bitch and take her money fo' sho (Fo' sho)

[Outro: Nate Dogg]
Ayo, ayo, ayo
You don't wanna step to me
Still claiming D.P.G. 'til the day I D-I-E

Ayo, ayo, ayo
You don't wanna step to me
Still claiming D.P.G. 'til the day I D-I-E

Ayo, ayo, ayo
You don't wanna step to me
Still claiming D.P.G. 'til the day I D-I-E

Ayo, ayo, ayo
You don't wanna step to me
Still claiming D.P.G. 'til the day I D-I-E

And uh, I’m living right, my health alright
My money good and my girl a dyke
Shit, let's live it up, no dying down
Lets shoot the bar, I’ll buy the rounds
I’ll take the shots, I’m bulletproof
Nike just do it, I do what it do
I was drinking 'fore I came
When I got here, I did the same
I don't like beer, I like champagne
So, cheers to Lil Wayne
And if she think she get my number, just hope my number don’t change
Girl stop playing, I got that pussy on a string
Now let’s do it!

[Bridge]
Let’s do it, let’s do it, let’s do it, let’s do it (No Ceilings)
And do it, and do it, let’s live it up (yeah)
And do it, and do it, and do it, do it, do it (ahaha)
Let’s do it, let’s do it, let’s do it (Young Mula babbbyyy)

Tonight’s gonna be a good night (motherfucker)
Tonight gonna be a good good night (Young Money)

Tonight’s gonna be a good good night (Scoob I see you)
No Ceilings

[Verse 2]
Kush got my dutch fat as fuck
Weezy F, I’m bad as luck
I’m already at the top, I'm 'bout to pull the ladder up
Flow crazy, I need a counselor
I’m hip-hop's announcer
I’m in the gun club, do you wanna meet the bouncer?
Been a beast and still I am
Now I rock and still I jam
Few niggas with me got that white girl like Will.I.Am
Look up bitch, ain't no ceilings
See me at the top controlling things
Anybody beat, it's a motherfucking murder scene
I do it

[Hook]

[Hook]

[Chorus]
Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic
Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic
Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic
Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic
Another dimension, another dimension
Another dimension, another dimension
Another dimension, another dimension
Another dimension, another dimension
Another dimension, another dimension
Another dimension, another dimension

[Verse 1: Mike D]
Well, now, don't you tell me to smile
You stick around, I'll make it worth your while
Got numbers beyond what you can dial
Maybe it's because I'm so versatile
Style, profile

[Verse 2: Ad-Rock]
I said it always brings me back when I hear "Ooh child"
From the Hudson River out to the Nile
I run the marathons 'til the very last mile

[Verse 3: MCA]
Well, if you battle me, I will revile
People always saying my style is wild
You've got gall, you've got guile (Guile)
To step to me, I’m a rapophile

[Verse 4: Mike D]
If you wanna battle, you're in denial
Coming from Uranus to check my style
Go ahead; put my rhymes on trial
Cast you off into exile

[Chorus]
Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic
Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic

[Verse 5: Ad-Rock]
Jazz and AWOL, that's our team
Step inside the party, disrupt the whole scene
When it comes to beats, well, I'm a fiend
I like my sugar with coffee and cream

[Verse 6: MCA]
Well, I gotta keep it going, keep it going full steam
Too sweet to be sour; too nice to be mean
Well, on the tough guy style, I'm not too keen
Trying to change the world, I will plot and scheme

[Verse 7: Mike D]
Mario C likes to keep it clean (Clean)
Goin' to shine like a sunbeam
Keep on rapping 'cause that's my dream
Got an A from Moe Dee for sticking to themes

[Verse 8: Ad-Rock]
Now when it comes to envy, y'all is green
Jealous of the rhyme and the rhyme routine ('tine)
Another dimension, new galaxy
Intergalactic planetary

[Chorus]
Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic
Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic
Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic
Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic

[Verse 9: MCA]
We're from the family tree of old school hip-hop
Kick off your shoes and relax your socks
The rhymes will spread just like a pox
'Cause the music is live, like an electric shock

[Verse 10: Mike D]
I am known to do the wop (Wop)
Also known for the Flintstone Flop
Tammy D getting biz on the crop (Crop)
Beastie Boys known to let the beat
"MMM, D-r-r-rop!"
Do it

[Verse 11: Ad-Rock]
Now when I wrote graffiti, my name was Slop
If my rap's soup, my beats is stock
Step from the table when I start to chop
I'm the lumberjack, DJ Adrock

[Verse 12: MCA]
If you try to knock me, you'll get mocked
I'll stir fry you in my wok
Your knees'll start shaking and your fingers pop
Like a pinch on the neck of Mr. Spock

[Chorus]
Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic
Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic
Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic
Intergalactic planetary, planetary intergalactic
Another dimension, another dimension
Another dimension, another dimension
Another dimension, another dimension
Another dimension, another dimension
Another dimension, another dimension
Another dimension, another dimension

[Outro]
Do it

[Intro]
A'udhu Billahi min ash-shaytaan-i'r rajeem. Bismillah-i'r Rahman-i'r Raheem

Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar
Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar

This is one's for all my brothers and sisters who died in Iraq, Israel, Afghanistan and right here in America
(Jesus Walks)

Abraham Taught
Muhammad Taught
And Moses split the sea
(Jesus Walk with me)
I ain't tryin' to profit off the prophets so this one's for free

[Verse 1]
G's up along with Muhammad and Jesus
In the Quran they call him Isa
Don't think Osama and Saddam is our leader
We pray for peace, but the drama intrigues us
All, so we fall for the illusions of the beast
So instead of tryin' to teach we show our teeth
Same God, different beliefs
Hijabs, Sunday clothes, yarmulke, kufi, same mission beneath
We all tryin' to get to where the sufferin' ends
In front of the Most High bein' judged for our sins
Can't front for the Most High, so the struggle
Continues
You, every bee, bird and tree, he, her and me
We virtually on the same boat
With the same goats, on the same sea
Tryin' to stay afloat, and put the devil in the yoke
With a couple of God's quotes

[Hook]
Ash-had an la ilaha illa llah
(Astaghfirullah)

[Verse 2]
And to the sisters and the mothers of ours
Who cover theyselves cause they're lovers of God
The Creator of the worlds, Sculptor of the stars
During Hajj, we walk, through Ramadaan, we starve
Though you not eatin', there's a feedin' of the mind
A defeatin' of the demons, a seein' of the signs
A leanin' on the lines from the surahs
Getting purer, God deemed it unclean
(There's no eatin' of the swine)
Nor drinkin' of the wine
We all bend to his whims, so I send out a message to my kind
I’m cordial to Mr. Norful, Mrs. Adams you’re the theme song when I’m battling
Creflo, player, what’s happening? I can hear the truth in your rappings
(No)
Sex before you marry
No grudges
You should carry, no lyin'
Not supposed to be gamblin'

[Hook]
(I know it sounds familiar)
We all the same man
It's all a game
The devil hate each and every one of us exactly the same
(I wanna walk like Jesus, talk like Jesus sall Allāhu ʿalay-hi wa-sallam)

[Verse 3]
You know
(uh)
And to my Akh's tryin to stay on their deen
It gets mean especially when you stay on the scene
And at the same try to stay out of trouble
But don't forget the blessin' is in the struggle
The Most Forgiving will forgive it if you stay repentant
And hustle
You gotta stay on your salats, your zakats, your Quran
To my homies and miskeen
Astagfirullah
Allah forgive us all
For we all are sinners
Bless us to be among the winners
When it ends
But until then please strengthen the mission within our hearts
All praise is due to God
(Amen)
Tellin' it how it was taught me
I ain't tryin' to sell it can be brought for free
This is how it is
Now how it ought to be
Muhammad talk to me
Jesus walk with me
I hope

[Hook]
(I know it sounds familiar)
We all the same man
It's all a game
The devil hate each and every one of us exactly the same
(I wanna walk like Jesus, talk like Jesus sall Allāhu ʿalay-hi wa-sallam)

[Intro]
He's laughing with another girl
And playing with another heart
Placing high stakes, making hearts ache
He's loved in seven languages
Jukebox life, Diamond nights and ruby lights
High in the sky
Heaven help him when he falls

[Verse 1]
Diamond life lover boy
He moves in space with minimum waste and maximum joy
City lights and business nights
When you require streetcar desire for higher heights

[Pre-Chorus]
No place for beginners or sensitive hearts
The sentiment is left to chance
No place to be ending but somewhere to start

[Chorus]
No need to ask
He's a smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator

[Post-Chorus]
Coast-to-coast, L.A. to Chicago: Western Maine
Across the North and South, to Key Largo: love for sale

[Verse 2]
Face-to-face, each classic case
We shadow box and double-cross
Yet need the chase

[Pre-Chorus]
A license to love, insurance to hold
Melts all your memories and change into gold
His eyes are like angels; his heart is cold

[Chorus]
No need to ask
He's a smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator

[Post-Chorus]
Coast-to-coast, L.A. to Chicago: Western male
Across the North and South, to Key Largo: love for sale

[Outro]
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
The long-awaited Detox, trick
‘Cause maybe I don’t wanna stop, maybe I don’t wanna quit
Maybe I like hoes, maybe I don’t want a wife, maybe I’m psycho
Maybe I’m crazy, maybe I’m strapped right now, just maybe
Maybe it’s a relapse
Maybe I’m high right now; where the weed at?
Maybe this is ER
Maybe I’m a real doc' and this is CPR
Maybe we need to breathe some life in this shit
Maybe we are the life of this shit
Maybe I’m just crazy (Crazy)
What they say? (What they say?) Sak pase (Sak pase)
Nap boulé (nap boulé) Ayyy

[Interlude: Jay-Z]
Ugh, ahh
Dre, I think I need my sponsor

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I’m just outta contro-o-ol
Maybe I got hoes, every little city I go, like Paco
We tryna grow, but I just can’t seen her
I’m havin’ trouble cleanin’ up, I’m like FEMA
All these little haters got me back with the Nina
Got me bringin’ guns to work, Gilbert Arenas
Unh, I don’t know if it’s the Goose talkin’
But you know they say the liquor get your truth talkin’
Maybe I should be somewhere in the group talkin’
I’m addicted to coupes and takin’ roofs off ‘em
I’m addicted to watches, Heckler and Koches
Them bow-legged girls from the projects
It’s Bed-Stuy in this bitch (Bed-Stuy!)
Dre, what’s up? (It’s Westside over here)
I’m in this party, I’m up to no good
And I should be duckin’ these clubs, Tiger Woods

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
I smoke (I smoke), I drink (I drink)
I’m supposed to stop, but I can’t
Nigga, don’t ask why (Ask why), I get high (I get high)
I’m just livin’ my mo’fuckin’ life
So what? I’m drunk (I’m drunk)
And I’m a weedhead (Weedhead)
And I’ma treat every day like the weekend
Headfirst off the deep end
Yeah, you know what’s happenin’
I’m just relapsin’

[Intro: Announcer & Eminem]
Jigoku e iku no wa omae ga saki da!
Welcome back to the stage of history
Yo, Slim Shady!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yo, I'll fuckin'... (Alright), I'll...
I'll puke, eat it, and freak you (Ew)
Battle? I'm too weeded to speak to
The only key that I see to defeat you
Would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you
And force feed you 'em both
And on each feet is a cleat shoe (Agh!)
I'll lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse
You'll think I pulled the fucking ground out from underneath you
(Bitch!) I ain't no fucking G, I'm a cannibal
I ain't tryin' to shoot you
I'm tryin' to chop you into pieces and eat you
Wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass
And have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin' mattress
Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers
Fuck the planet 'til it spins on a broken axis
I'm so bananas I'm showing up to your open casket
To fill it full of explosive gases and close it back
With a lit match in it while I sit back and just hope it catches
Blow you to fragments, laugh, roll you, and smoke the ashes

[Chorus: J-Black]
I see the light at the end
But every time I take a step it gets dim
Tell me, is this Hell we're livin' in?
If so, Heaven's got to be better
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down
I see the light at the end
But every time I take a step it gets dim
Tell me, is this Hell we're livin' in?
If so, Heaven's got to be better
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down

[Verse 2: J-Black]
Am I the worst because I never go to church? (Never)
I run a red light then sideswipe a hearse
I'ma drink till my liver rot, see the doc leave the E.R
Then hit a bar for a liquor shot; fuck the liver spot!
One day we all gon' die
But when I die, I'ma be so high
That I'ma get up and walk, leaving the concrete bare
With the chalk outline still there
I smoke 'til I choke and I sex a lot
I got a cross on my chain, but it's just to rock
Now if I pray every night (Night)
Do I still have to hold my tray very tight?
You feel me, God? I done did so much shit while on Earth
I smoke, I drink, I curse, and to make matters worse
I bust my gun first, and then I chat with your corpse
Since way back, I was one to never like back-talk
See me at the pearly gates in line, wearing a North Face
Nickle 9 at my waist, God done lost faith
Angels greet me, but I don't reply back
Just show me to my quarters, and oh yeah, where's Thai at?

[Chorus: J-Black]
I see the light at the end
But every time I take a step it gets dim
Tell me, is this Hell we're livin' in?
If so, Heaven's got to be better
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down

[Interlude: Announcer]
Maxi was seriously wounded
But the soul still burns
Final battle, fight!

[Verse 3: Masta Ace]
Analyze the strength of my game, like Lee Corso
Call me a lost soul, with a vest on my torso
And of course, yo, y'all know I'm no stranger to danger
Like Christ in a manger, feel a whole range of my anger
I breathe down shit so hard you can see sound
And beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds
My pen 'bout as sharp as a dagger, walk with a swagger
Tie your wife to the back of a black Jag and I drag her
Ten blocks, untie the bitch, and I still bag her
Give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager
My shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel
My flows spill, like using the wrong end of a funnel
Everyday I grow more older and more colder
Fly you to Colorado, roll you over with a boulder
I know you want to retaliate but you won't dare
‘Cause you're fuckin' with some niggas like this who just don't care

[Chorus: J-Black]
I see the light at the end
But every time I take a step it gets dim
Tell me, is this Hell we're livin' in?
If so, Heaven's got to be better
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down

[Outro: J-Black & Announcer]
But every time I take a step it gets dim
Tell me, is this Hell we're livin' in? (Haha)
Time's up! You lose!
Katta ne!

"All I see is murder murder, my mindstate"
"Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate"
"All I see is murder murder, my mindstate"

"All I see is murder murder, my mindstate"
"Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate"
"All I see is murder murder, my mindstate"
"Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill"

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Left the keys in the van with a gat in each hand
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman
Fuck a peace plan if a citizen bystands
The shit is in my hands, here's your lifespan
And for what your life's worth, this money is twice than
Grab a couple grand and lay up in Iceland
See, I'm a nice man, but money turned me to Satan
I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydratin'
Hurry up with the cash, bitch, I got a ride waitin'
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried skatin'
I want the whole pie, I won't be denied Nathan
Maybe I need my head inside straightened
Brain contemplatin', clean out the register
Dip before somebody catches ya
Or gets your description and sketches ya
Then connects you as the prime suspect
But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
'Cause I got a daughter to feed
And two hundred dollars ain't enough to water the seed
The best thing would be for me to leave Taco Bell
And hit up Chess King and have the lady at the desk bring
Money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin' a MAC
Co-operate and we can operate and save an attack
This bitch tried escapin' the jack
Grabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote
You barely heard a word as she choked
It wasn't nothin' for her to be smoked
Then I slammed her on her back 'til her vertebrae broke
Just then the pigs bust in yellin', "Freeze!"
But I'm already wanted for sellin' keys
And a bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin' bees
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees
I bust shots, they bust back
Hit me square in the chest, wasn't wearin' a vest

[Scratches: DJ Lenn Swann]
"All I see is murder murder, my mindstate"

"All I see is murder murder, my mindstate"
"Murder, murder, murder and kill, kill, kill"

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Left the house, pullin' out the drive, backin' out
Blew the back end out this lady's Jag, started blackin' out
Pulled the MAC-10 out
Stuck it in her face: "Shut your yackin' mouth
'Fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp!"
Drug her by her hair, smacked her up
Figured, "Fuck it—mug her while you're there," jacked her up
Stole her car and made a profit
Grabbed the tape from out the deck and loft it
Out the window like the girl in Set It Off did
Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal
Drove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin' pool
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio
I made it out alive, but I'm injured badly though
Parents screamin', "Johnny, go in and call the police!
Tell 'em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace!"
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
Actin' like they never seen nobody hit a lick before
Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64
When they sell out in stores, the price triples
I ran up the block jumpin' kids on tricycles
And collided with an eighty-year-old lady with groceries
There goes cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties
Stood up and started to see stars
Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars
Barely escaped, musta been some dumb luck
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin' dump truck
But I think somebody seen me maybe
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I musta dropped a Beanie Baby
Fuck it, I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits
Came out with a white flag hollerin', "truce-truce!"(Don't shoot!)
And surrendered my weapon to cops
Wasn't me, it was the gangster rap and the peppermint Schnapps

[Scratches: DJ Lenn Swann]

[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
Remember when you were young
You shone like the Sun

[Refrain: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
Shine on, you crazy diamond

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
Now there's a look in your eyes
Like black holes in the sky

[Refrain: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
Shine on, you crazy diamond

[Chorus 1: Roger Waters]
You were caught in the crossfire of childhood and stardom
Blown on the steel breeze
Come on, you target for faraway laughter
Come on, you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine

[Verse 3: Roger Waters]
You reached for the secret too soon
You cried for the Moon

[Refrain: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
Shine on, you crazy diamond

[Verse 4: Roger Waters]
Threatened by shadows at night
And exposed in the light

[Refrain: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
Shine on (Shine on), you crazy diamond (You crazy diamond)

Well, you wore out your welcome with random precision
Rode on the steel breeze
Come on, you raver, you seer of visions
Come on, you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine

[Intro: Hittman]
Xxplosive, West coast shit
My nigga-ish ways attract girls that used to turn they back
Causing me to yank they arm and pose like I would do them harm
Now I'm saying "Thank you" 'cause they tell me my shit's the bomb
Xxplosive
For my niggas drinking Cognac, smoking weed, always pack
More than one firearm, chrome rims, riding on
Chronic in your system, let me know my shit's the bomb
Xxplosive

[Verse 1: Kurupt]
West Coast shit, nigga
Over-dosage, imperial pistols ferocious
Fuck a bitch, don't tease, bitch, striptease, bitch
Eat a bowl of these, bitch, gobble a dick
Hoes forgot to eat a dick and shut the fuck up (Fuck up, bitch)
Gobble and swallow a nut up, shut up. and get my cash (Cash)
Backhanded, pimp-slapped backwards, and left stranded
Just pop your collar, pimp convention, hoes for a dollar
Six-Deuce in a plush, six-deuce Impala
Pimping hoes from Texas to Guatemala
Bitch niggas pay for hoes (Hoes) just to lay with hoes (Hoes)
Relax one night and pay to stay with hoes (Hoes)
Captain Save-'Em-All-Day (Bitch), well, save this dick
Bitch nigga, you more of a bitch than a bitch
You ain't into hittin' pussy or hittin' a switch
You into hitting bitches off with a grip, you punk bitch

[Verse 2: Nate Dogg]
All my real dogs still kick it with me
All my down hoes still tricking with me
All the true gangstas know
Nate ain't never love no ho
All the hoodrats still shake it for me
All my true fans still checking for me
All the real smokers know
Nate ain't passing nothing' but dope
Indeed
Real trees
Chronic leaves
No seeds
When I met you last night, baby
Before I blew your mind (Blew, blew, blew your mind)
I thought we had a chance, lady
No more—now that I'm sober, you ain't that fine, mm-mm
Don't wanna treat you wrong
Don't wanna lead you on
Here, baby, hit the bong
While the West Coast rolls along
(While we) Still making gangsta hits
(You be) Still jockin' gangsta dicks
Damn, girl, you think you're slick?
Somebody better get this bitch, this bitch

[Verse 3: Six2]
I got these freaky hoes clapping they hands, stomping they feet
Every now and then, they put they mouth on me
Nowadays, a G like me can't even call it
A 23-year-old pussy fiend and freakaholic
Pimping bitches on the regular, I put that on the G
A hustler and a player: Nowadays, it pays to be
Let me drop some shit about this bitch I used to know
She gave your boy the head and said, "Don't let nobody know"
A bona fide pro, I had to grab the ho
She got freaky in your sixty-four, I skeeted in her throat
Been knowin' the ho for four days, pimpery pays
And I bet you didn't know that she go both ways
She ate her best friend, I left them hoes at the Mo'
They be beeping me and shit, but we don't kick it no more
Them hot hoes is fiending, they on the nuts
But bitch, I'm out your pussy when I nut, for real

[Outro: Hittman]
Xxplosive!

Hah, yeah

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Mista Busta, where the fuck you at?
Can't scrap a lick, so I know you got your gat
Your dick on hard from fuckin' your road dogs
The hoods you threw up with, niggas you grew up with
Don't even respect your ass
That's why it's time for the doctor to check your ass, nigga
Used to be my homie, used to be my ace
Now I wanna slap the taste out ya mouth
Make ya bow down to the Row
Fuckin' me, now I'm fuckin' you, lil' ho
Oh, don't think I forgot, let you slide
Let me ride, just another homicide
Yeah, it's me so I'ma talk on
Stomping on the easiest streets that you can walk on
So strap on your Compton hat, your locs
And watch your back 'cause you might get smoked, loc
And pass the bud and stay low-key
B.G., 'cause you lost all your homie's love
Now call it what you want to
You fucked with me, now it's a must that I fuck with you

[Interlude: RBX]
You better raise up
Yeah, that's what the fuck I'm talkin' about
We have your mothafuckin' record company surrounded
Put down the candy and let the little boy go
You know what I'm sayin'? Punk motherfucker
We want Eazy! We want Eazy! We want Eazy!

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Bow wow wow yippy yo yippy yay
Doggy Dogg's in the motherfuckin' house
Bow wow wow yippy yo yippy yay

Bow wow wow yippy yo yippy yay

Play with my bone, would ya Timmy?
It seems like you're good for making jokes about your jimmy
Well, here's a jimmy joke about your mama that you might not like
I heard she was a 'Frisco dyke
But fuck your mama, I'm talking about you and me
Toe to toe, Tim M-U-T
Your bark was loud but your bite wasn't vicious
And them rhymes you were kickin' were quite bootylicious
You get with Doggy Dogg? "Oh, is he crazy?"
With your mama and your daddy hollering "Baby!"
So won't they let you know
That if you fuck with Dre, nigga, you're fuckin' wit Death Row
And I ain't even swangin' them thangs

So you wanna pop that shit, get your motherfuckin' cranium cracked, nigga, step on up
Now, we ain't no motherfuckin' joke, so remember the name
Mighty, mighty D-R
Yeah, motherfucker (The shit done hit the fan)

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg]
Now understand this, my nigga Dre can't be touched
Luke's bending over so Luke's getting fucked, buster
Must've thought I was sleazy
Or thought I was a mark 'cause I used to hang with Eazy
Animosity made you speak what you spoke (Yeah)
Ayo, Dre (What up?) Chip this nigga off, loc
If it ain't another ho that I gots to fuck with
Gap teeth in your mouth so my dick's gots to fit
With my nuts on your tonsils
While you're on stage rappin' at your wack-ass concert
And I'ma snatch your ass from the backside
And show you how Death Row pull off that who-ride
Now you might not understand me
'Cause I'ma rob you in Compton and blast you in Miami
Then we gonna creep to South Central
On a street knowledge mission as I steps in the temple
Spot him, got him, as I pulls out my strap
Got my chrome to the side of his White Sox hat
You tryna check my homie, you best check yourself
'Cause when you diss Dre you diss yourself, motherfucker (Yeah, nigga)

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
So I don't want no dilapidated, two-faced, pigeon-toed, bow-legged, cross-eyed son of a gun fuckin' with me (Fuckin' with me)

All them sucka-ass niggas can eat a fat dick
Yeah, Eazy-E, Eazy-E, Eazy-E can eat a big fat dick
Tim Dog can eat a big fat dick
Luke can eat a fat dick
Yeah (Yeah)

[Intro: Eminem & Kim]
Aw, look at daddy's baby girl
That's daddy's baby, little sleepy head
Yesterday I changed your diaper
Wiped you and powdered you
How did you get so big?
Can't believe it, now you're two
Baby, you're so precious, daddy's so proud of you
Sit down, bitch! You move again, I'll beat the shit out of you! (Okay!)

[Verse 1: Eminem & Kim]
Don't make me wake this baby!
She don't need to see what I'm 'bout to do!
Quit crying, bitch! Why do you always make me shout at you?!
How could you just leave me and love him out the blue?!
Oh, what's the matter, Kim? Am I too loud for you?
Too bad, bitch! You're gonna finally hear me out this time!
At first I'm like, "Aight, you wanna throw me out, that's fine!"
But not for him to take my place, are you out your mind?!
This couch, this TV, this whole house is mine!
How could you let him sleep in our bed?! Look it, Kim!
Look at your husband now! (No!) I said look at him!
He ain't so hot now, is he?
Little punk!
(Why are you doing this?!) Shut the fuck up! (You're drunk!)
(You're never gonna get away with this!) You think I give a fuck?!
C'mon! We're going for a ride, bitch! (No!) Sit up front!
(We can't just leave Hailie alone, what if she wakes up?)
We'll be right back — well, I will, you'll be in the trunk

[Chorus: Eminem]
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you

[Verse 2: Eminem & Kim]
You really fucked me, Kim, you really did a number on me!
Never knew me cheating on you would come back to haunt me
But we was kids then, Kim, I was only eighteen
That was years ago, I thought we wiped the slate clean
That's fucked up! (I love you!) Oh God, my brain is racin'
(I love you!) What are you doing? Change the station!
I hate this song! Does this look like a big joke? (No!)
There's a 

[four]-year-old little 

[boy]
Laying dead with a slit throat in your living room!
Ha-ha! What, you think I'm kiddin' you?!
You loved him, didn't you? (No!)
Bullshit, you bitch! Don't fucking lie to me!
What the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me?
Fuck you, asshole! Yeah, bite me!
Kim? Kim! Why don't you like me?
You think I'm ugly, don'tchu? (It's not that!) No, you think I'm ugly
(Baby!) Get the fuck away from me! Don't touch me!
I hate you! I hate you! I swear to God, I hate you!
Oh my God, I love you! How the fuck could you do this to me?!
(I'm sorry!) How the fuck could you do this to me?!

[Chorus: Eminem]
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you

[Verse 3: Eminem & Kim]
Come on, get out! (I can't! I'm scared!)
I said get out, bitch! (Let go of my hair! Please don't do this, baby! Please! I love you! Look, we can just take Hailie and leave!)
Fuck you!
You did this to us! You did it! It's your fault!
"Oh my God, I'm crackin' up" Get a grip, Marshall!
Hey, remember the time we went to Brian's party
And you were, like, so drunk that you threw up all over Archie?
That was funny, wasn't it? (Yes)
That was funny, wasn't it?! (Yes!)
See, it all makes sense, doesn't it?
You and your husband have a fight, one of you tries to grab a knife
And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced (No!)
And while this is going on, his son just woke up
And he walks in, she panics, and he gets his throat cut
(Oh my God!)  So now they both dead
And you slash your own throat
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note
I shoulda known better when you started to act weird
We coulda— hey, where you going? Get back here!
You can't run from me, Kim! It's just us, nobody else
You're only making this harder on yourself!
Ha-ha, gotcha! Go ahead, yell!
Here, I'll scream with you, "Ah! Somebody help!"
Don't you get it, bitch? No one can hear you!
Now shut the fuck up, and get what's comin' to you!
You were supposed to love me!
Now bleed, bitch, bleed! Bleed, bitch, bleed! Bleed!

[Chorus: Eminem]
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you
So long, bitch, you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on
Living in this world without you

[Verse 1: Chris Brown, Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
All that bullshit's for the birds
You ain't nothin' but a vulture-ure-ure-ure
Always hoping for the worst
Waitin' for me to fuck up
You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
That know just what I need, she know just what I mean
When I tell her, "Keep it drama free"
Woah-woah
(Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
Chu-Chuckin' up them deuces
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
Yeah, yeah, told you that I'm leaving, deuces
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
Woah, woah
I know you mad, but so what? I wish you best of luck
And now I'm finna throw them deuces up

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Kevin McCall]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her (Deuces)
I'm moving on to somethin' better, better, better
No more tryna make it work (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye-bye (Say bye-bye)
Say bye-bye (Say bye-bye)
Say bye-bye to her (Say bye-bye, deuces)
You made me wanna say bye-bye (Say bye-bye)
Say bye-bye (Say bye-bye)
Say bye-bye to her (Say bye-bye)

[Verse 2: Tyga, Chris Brown]
Uh, used to be Valentines, together all the time
Thought it was true love, but you know women lie
It's like I sent my love with a text two times
Call 'cause I care, but I ain't get no reply (No reply)
Tryna see eye to eye, but it's like we both blind
Fuck it, let's hit the club, I rarely sip but pour me some
'Cause when it's all said and done
I ain't gon' be the one that she can always run to
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
I hate liars, fuck love, I'm tired of tryin'
My heart big, but it beat quiet
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
I don't never feel like we vibin'
'Cause every time we alone, it's a awkward silence
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
So leave your keys on the kitchen counter
And give me back that ruby ring with the big diamond
Shit, it's over, what you trippin' for?
I don't wanna have to let you go
But, baby, I think it's better if I let you know

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Kevin McCall]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her (Deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work, no (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye-bye (Say bye-bye, bye-bye)
Say bye-bye (Say bye-bye, bye-bye)
Say bye-bye to her (Say bye-bye, oh-oh, deuces)
You made me wanna say bye-bye (Say bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye)
Say bye-bye (Say bye-bye)
Say bye-bye to her, yeah (Say bye-bye)

[Verse 3: Kevin McCall, Chris Brown]
Look, my shawty always on some bullshit like Chicago
So I flip that middle finger and the index finger follow
Deuces, we ain't got no future in tomorrow
I'm a dick, so it shouldn't be that hard to swallow
The other chick I'm with never complainin'
She make me wanna leave the one I'm with, Usher Raymond
Prolly didn't register, don't trip, later on, it will
Shorty full of drama, like Gangsta Gri-zills
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
I finally noticed it, it finally hit me
Like Tina did Ike in the limo, it finally hit me
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
I got a new chick, and she ain't you
She Paula Patton thick, she give me déjà vu
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
And all that attitude, I don't care about it
But all that shit I do for her, you gon' hear about it
Breezy rep two up, two down
But I'm just puttin' two up, chuckin' up the deuce now (Oh!)

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Kevin McCall]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her, oh-oh (Deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better (Better, baby)
No more tryna make it work, hey (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye-bye (Say bye-bye)
Say bye-bye (Say bye-bye, say, say)
Say bye-bye to her (Say bye-bye, bye-bye, deuces)
You made me wanna say bye-bye (Say bye-bye)
Say bye-bye (Say bye-bye, say, say)
Say bye-bye to her (Say bye-bye), deuces

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & John Legend]
I got the world in my hands, the master plan
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep
All of these girls at my shows, they lovin' me
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep callin' you, hey

[Bridge: Kanye West]
All the models to the floor right now
All the models to the floor right now, what, huh?
All the models to the floor right now
All the models to the floor right now, huh?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I’m in my Christian Dior with a Veronica Webb
Noemie Lenoir, Chanel, Sessilee Lopez
Arlenis Sosa, Selita Ebanks
Grew up on Mobb Deep and speak that Jourdan Dunn language
Make a phone call out to Joan Smalls
I wonder how it feel in Lara Stone's walls?
Jessica Gomes, y'all, I would damage her
And see if Jessica Stam got the stamina
I’m in the car with Leo and the Benz swerve
I heard Bar was friends with Esti Ginzburg
Coco Rocha, Kate Mimosa
Alessandra Ambrosio, Anja Rubik and Olga
Kurylenko, tell her I’m very single
Abbey Lee too, I’m a freak, boo
I’m wilding, I’m on a thousand
I wanna see Irina Shayk next to Doutzen

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & John Legend]
I got the world in my hands, the master plan
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep
All of these girls at my shows, they lovin' me
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep callin' you, hey

[Interlude: Kanye West]
Christian Dior denim flow
I told her I’m tryin' to eat out, so what we goin' to dinner fo'?

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Miami nights, on the search for some T and A
Tryin' to hide what’s obvious to see in me
We conversate a bit about your DNA
And my salmon-colored suit from the VMAs
Oh, you was watchin'? Who the fuck wasn’t?
Me, skip across that stage in five dozen
Yuuugh! Six grand for a minute's time
Italian Vogue styled a nigga for a minute-rhyme
Let's be clear, and let's be fair
The best thing in music’s being offered here
It's a round table full of bosses here
Still giving you it all like the coffin's near

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & John Legend]
I got the world in my hands, the master plan
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep
All of these girls at my shows, they lovin' me
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep callin' you, hey

[Bridge: Kanye West]
All the models to the floor right now
All the models to the floor right now, what, huh?
All the models to the floor right now
All the models to the floor right now, huh?

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & John Legend]
I got the world in my hands, the master plan
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep
All of these girls at my shows, they lovin' me
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep callin' you, hey

[Verse 3: Ryan Leslie]
It’s time for a lesson in model behavior
Damn, look at all the bad bitches I gave you
Man, I can see the flaws to your flavor
Look like Wonder Woman and still need a savior
Maybe it's a billionaire, maybe it's that cocaine
I done seen drugs and money run the whole game
A good girl lost in the city life
Agent Provocateur, hold them titties right
I'm haute couture of hoes galore
Give my girl a Newport 'cause she's smoking yours
I'm the authority of model seniority
They call me "Les" but they all need more of me

[Verse 4: Lloyd Banks]
Ugh, handcraft material, champagne for cereal
Shawty stole my heart, criminal, my lucky charm, ugh
Fly clothes and Lear shows take the stuff we on
Stuff all my problems in that bong, and I’m puffin' strong
I been locked in my way of thinkin', now my cuffs are gone
Must’ve been the liquor talkin, I’m beggin' the cups, c'mon (C'mon)
Might come off as irregular, I come in custom form
T-G-I-F, GT breeze, my hustler’s poem (Yeah)
My sound’s full-grown, reminds me of my favorite chronic (Kush)
Ball like a SuperSonic, make the haters vomit (Ugh!)
Nigga, make some money ‘fore you make a comment
I meant to snap a while ago, but who knows where the time went?
Probably dime chicks, whips with a Diddy
Now I’m back like a nine-milli, running New York City
See me clearly through the storm, the world’s mine
Sits pretty in my palm, Chandon as we continue on

[Chorus: Kid Cudi & John Legend]
I got the world in my hands, the master plan
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep
All of these girls at my shows, they lovin' me
But I don’t know why I keep callin', why I keep callin' you, hey

[Verse 5: Kid Cudi]
Niggas think they know, only got half of the story
They don't really know what's in my head fuckin' with me
How can I be better? I could start with just the basics
Dior, Dior galore, I love the cut
I seem to have forgotten that I’m off the looney
To the people who don't know Cud, know what?
Rose gold presidential on my bony wrist
Took my ma to Chanel, held Elsie, the stunner
She got haters, some in the fam made us
But they don’t really matter, we escape 'em with our paper
Hey ya, I’m on my André 3000
I’m all good now, a nigga don’t need no counseling
Woke up in the room and my mojo was active
Looks from the hoes that were more than likely passive
Back when–let me not reflect on the old shit
I’m on to the new act, on to my new script
Bitches better have they thoughts before approachin'
I done heard it all, baby, save it for them other niggas
Doin' things off-beat for a living
Haters copy, I'm the image, hey
Haters copy, I'm the image

[Chorus 1: Bruno Mars & B.o.B]
Beautiful girls
All over the world
I could be chasin'
But my time would be wasted
They got nothin' on you, baby
Nothin' on you, baby
They might say hi
And I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry
About what they say
'Cause they got nothin' on you, baby
(Yeah) Nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
I know you feel where I'm comin' from
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun
On the carousel, so around I spun
With no directions, just tryna get some
Tryna chase skirts, livin' in the summer sun
And so I lost more than I had ever won
And honestly, I ended up with none

[Pre-Chorus 1: B.o.B]
There's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinkin' maybe I should get it out
And I don't wanna sound redundant, but I was wonderin'
If there was somethin' that you wanna know (That you wanna know)
But never mind that, we should let it go (We should let it go)
'Cause we don't wanna be a TV episode (TV episode)
And all the bad thoughts, just let 'em go
(Go, go, go, go)

[Chorus 2: Bruno Mars & B.o.B]
Beautiful girls
All over the world
I could be chasin'
But my time would be wasted
They got nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
Nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
They might say hi (Hi)
And I might say hey (Hey)
But you shouldn't worry
About what they say (Why?)
'Cause they got nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
Nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Hands down, there will never be another one
I been around and I never seen another one
Because your style, they ain't really got nothin' on
And you wild when you ain't got nothin' on
Baby, you the whole package, plus you pay your taxes
And you keep it real while them others stay plastic
You're my Wonder Woman, call me Mr. Fantastic
Stop, now think about it

[Pre-Chorus 2: B.o.B]
I've been to London (Yeah), I've been to Paris (Yeah)
Even way out there to Tokyo (Tokyo)
Back home down in Georgia (Yeah) to New Orleans (Yeah)
But you always steal the show (Steal the show)
And just like that, girl, you got me froze (Got me froze)
Like a Nintendo 64 (64)
If you never knew, well, now you know
(Know, know, know, know)

[Chorus 2: Bruno Mars & B.o.B]
Beautiful girls
All over the world
I could be chasin'
But my time would be wasted (Ha-ha)
They got nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
Nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
They might say hi (Hi)
And I might say hey (Hey)
But you shouldn't worry
About what they say (Why?)
'Cause they got nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
Nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you

[Bridge: B.o.B]
Everywhere I go
I'm always hearin' your name
And no matter where I'm at
Girl, you make me wanna sing
Whether a bus or a plane
Or a car or a train
No other girl's on my brain
And you the one to blame

[Chorus 2: Bruno Mars & B.o.B]
Beautiful girls
All over the world
I could be chasin'
But my time would be wasted (Why?)
They got nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
Nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
They might say hi (Hi)
And I might say hey (Hello)
But you shouldn't worry
About what they say (Why?)
'Cause they got nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
Nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you

[Outro: B.o.B]
Yeah, and that's just how we do it
Heheheh, and I'ma let this ride
B.o.B and Bruno Mars

[Intro]
K-K-K-K-K-K-Mac

[Verse 1: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
All that bullshit's for the birds, you ain't nothing but a vulture (Oh, oh, oh)
Always hoping for the worst, waiting for me to fuck up
You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
Who knows just what I need, she knows just what I mean when I tell her keep it drama free
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
Chu-chuckin' up them deuces
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah (Yeah, yeah)
Told you that I'm leaving, deuces
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah (Woah, woah)
I know you're mad, but so what? I wish you best of luck
And now I'm finna throw them deuces up

[Verse 2: Drake]
What you mean I ain't call you? I hit you when I landed
I'm waitin' in my hotel room
Seems like we're arguin' more and it's gettin' less romantic
Yeah, I think she'll be able to tell soon
But I'll fuck you right, I will, I fuck you right, I will
I'll fuck you like no one has ever, ever made you feel
I mean, this part of our relationship's amazin' still
I might just put up with the arguin' and stay, for real
You lookin' bad, girl, for goodness sakes
You with all those curves, and me without no brakes, ooh
I'm willin' to work it out however long it takes you
You feel like you miss those happy days
Well, girl, that makes two of us, our timing is wrong
Your friends always tyin' up every line on your phone
Yeah, but tell them bitches that you'll always be my missus
And the hardest part about the fuckin' business
Is mindin' your own, uh, and every time I try and break it off
We just yell until we tired, then I break you off
It's useless, all this fightin', let's get past it now
Even when I throw them deuces, you just send it back around

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Your wrist and fingers glisten, ice cold like Michigan
Ayy, look at what we livin' in, here we go with this again
I just keep on talkin', but I guess that you ain't listenin'
Rather run around with them nothin'-ass bitches then
Go on, got me hot, smokin' like a chimney
We used to be best friends, now it seems we finna be enemies
Deep inside it’s killin' me, but soon it's gon' be killin' you
To see her in that two-seater, know that's gon' hurt your feelings, boo
Ah ha, didn’t you think you would be over me by now?
So you go sleepin' with them clowns, they are no relief
She spoke her piece, I know, capisce
So love must be let go, released, into the wind
Again, again, and deuces I must throw ya, peace

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
You know what, yo? You a bitch
You should have a travel agent, ‘cause you a trip
You should make your own toilet tissue since you the shit
But all you got is some fuckin' issues, you fuckin' bitch
I hate niggas, but I love your mom
Give her a kiss for me, her second son
Get your mind right, baby, or get your shit together
You gonna be hot a little while, I'ma be rich forever
Girl seducers, they come in deuces
But when I cut 'em off they always become a nuisance
Niggas take my old flows and they take my old swag
He just took my old bitch and turned it to his new bitch (Haha)
I'm stupid, but I won't get my drama on
What I'm dealin' with is too real for me to comment on
Jay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth
So when you talk 'bout “you know who”
I don't know who you talkin' 'bout

[Verse 5: Fabolous]
According to my old bish, I be on some new ish
She was on some oldish, now I got a new bish
Think I give two-ish? You ain't gonna do ish
Meet my two fingers, intro-deuces
If you knew better, you'd do better
Wanna get the middle finger, but I got two better

[Interlude: Chris Brown & Drake]
So you gonna diss me
Even though you know it’s wrong
Know you gon' miss me a little when I’m gone

[Verse 6: Fabolous]
Drizzy voice
Now I'm ghost, baby, four-door Rizzy Royce
Tryna work it out might be a bad business choice
I'm 'bout my business, boys, plus I make paper
Come on, that's old news, yesterday's paper (Nice)
Oh, you talkin', what about?
If it ain't how I kept you studded out
You might as well shut your mouth
You'll never score another me, I'll shut it out
Act like there's gum in your hair, girl, cut it out!

[Verse 7: Rick Ross]
Got a pocket full of hundreds, she the only one that's missin'
Got a bucket full of ice, and a watch to go with it (Ugh!)
Got a racin' Lamborghini, have my homies scared to drive
Haters better put their head down, they know that boy be fly
All the charter planes, now I’m talkin' ballers slang
R.O.Z.A.Y. on that wall in that Hall of Fame (Ugh!)
I let my denim sag, red Louis belt
How can you love me, baby? First, you gotta love yourself

[Verse 8: Andre 3000]
The farewell email from a female
But I’m a playa, ain't gonna tell you all the details
What it entails is hard to say, like sellin' seashells
By the seashore, but she’s not a bore
But neither a whore who needs to know more
The kind you can’t ignore but want to open the door for
Or run in your favorite store, and leave with all them shopping bags and half of it ain't yours
I did things for her; ain't rich, ain't poor
I wanted to do more, but hell, I just ain't know her
Well enough to know if this is all she came for
But enough to know tonight excited she came four
Times to my cousin house to see if I was there
Get your minds out the gutter, man
We out here tryna have a good time
And here I am, all heavy with the words where
Somebody that's a nerd, likely fast forward
But, shit, they asked for it
It’s hard to throw up them deuces
‘Cause when you know it’s juicy
You start to sound like Confucius when makin' up excuses
Chase Cabooses until the track gone
I gotta find me a new locomotive, stop makin' sad songs

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chucking my deuces up to her (Deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Snoopy
Is what they say as if they knew me
Groupies, on my head like a cufi
My nigga Kid Cudi, that's my little buddy
Call some hoes up, and get some cutty cutty
What's your life like? Mine's is kinda tight
A long way from hustlin', that china white
My people love me, the fans love me, I'm all go
If you ain't showin' love, then what you call for?
I don't need it in my life, my kids pay the price
So alike and in need of my wife
Smoke 'til I'm gone, Dogg on the throne
I'm world-wide known, I'm a boss in the zone
I get it how I get it 'cause I can, I earn my spot
You see the plan, I'm just fuckin' with my fans
I turned out to be the better man, important to life
You understand while I'm puffin' on this gram

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Everything I'm havin', no there ain't necessity
Though I'm shining, keep on grindin'
What you see ain't all of me
Though I keep them ho's, don't love them ho's
The code in which y'all roll
It's so simple what I need
You know I keep my fam and I can't forget that tree

[Refrain: Kid Cudi]
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah
I can't forget that tree
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah
I can't forget that tree
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah
I can't forget that tree
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah
Nah nah, nah nah nah
(Nah nah nah, nah nah nah)

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
I got my fam dawg, look at my niggas
Got a little money y'all, and I ain't trippin'
Most days I'm faded, feeling ex-rated
Steady wantin' freaky hoes, then I want a lady
Holdin' the fam down, and my close homie
The peoples who were there, when some sucka left me lonely
Phony, when you see a nigga don't approach me
Made it to the top baby, that's on me
Koch tryna claim that they made me
However you feel, another real fugazzi
I keep it one hundred, never frontin', don't need be
I'm in another zone, no place you could see, my nigga
Conyo to haters that don't know
Low pro, how a nigga like from costo
The one fans love, who was always approachable, yo
And I rep the double O, smokin', eatin' Cheerios

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Everything I'm havin', no there ain't necessity
Though I'm shining, keep on grindin'
What you see ain't all of me
Though I keep them ho's, don't love them ho's
The code in which y'all roll
It's so simple what I need
You know I keep my fam and I can't forget that tree

[Refrain: Kid Cudi]
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah
I can't forget that tree
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah
I can't forget that tree
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah
I can't forget that tree
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah
Nah nah, nah nah nah
(Nah nah nah, nah nah nah)

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Can't forget it, they made me who I am, a king
And I'm still on the scene, you gotta love it
All out in public, the people want to touch it
I need a blunt with the stuffin'
Nigga, it's nothin' for me to chill out, post up at the house
With Madden on the screen, and smash on the homies
Hollywood nice now, everybody on me
And on the blogs talk shit like they know me, hm
Aww fool, take you niggas to school
"How to get rich and stay cool"
Snoopy D O Dub, show you homie, even with the critics
And the Feds all on me, I was tappin' all the chonies
Dogg, but my folks call me Snoopy
Boss dogg, nigga sue me
Pony tail swangin' as I lay in the jacuzzi
Love of my life, while I'm puffin' on the oww wee, kush

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Everything I'm havin', no there ain't necessity
Though I'm shining, keep on grindin'
What you see ain't all of me
Though I keep them ho's, don't love them ho's
The code in which y'all roll
It's so simple what I need
You know I keep my fam and I can't forget that tree

[Refrain: Kid Cudi]
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah
I can't forget that tree
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah
I can't forget that tree
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah
I can't forget that tree
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah
Nah nah, nah nah nah

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Snoop Dogg in the house tonight blowing that Laker purp that I know you like, right?
Kid Cudi, my nephew, blaze that shit right now would you, would you, right?
Snoop Dogg in the house tonight blazing that Laker purp that I know you like, right?
Kid Cudi, my nephew, blaze that shit right now my nigga, right?

[Intro: Eminem]
Only reason I dissed you in the first place
Is 'cause you denied seeing me, now I'm pissed off

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Sit back, homie, relax, in fact, grab a six pack
Kick back while I kick facts, yeah, Dre—sick track
Perfect way to get back, wanna hear something wick-wack?
I got the same exact tat that's on Nick's back
I'm obsessed now, oh gee
Is that supposed to be me in the video with the goatee?
Wow Mariah, didn't expect you to go balls out
Bitch, shut the fuck up 'fore I put all them phone calls out
You made to my house when you was wildin' out before Nick
When you was on my dick and give you something to smile about
How many times you fly to my house, still tryin' to count
Better shut your lyin' mouth if you don't want Nick findin' out
You probably think 'cause it's been so long
If I had something on you I woulda did it by now
Oh on the contrary, Mary Poppins, I'm mixin' our studio
Session down and sendin' it to masterin' to make it loud
Enough dirt on you to murder you
This is what the fuck I do; Mariah it ever occur to you
That I still have pictures? However you prefer to do
And that goes for Nick too, faggot, you think I'm scurred of you?
You're gonna ruin my career, you better get one
Like I'ma sit and fight with you over some slut bitch cunt
That made me put up with her psycho ass over six months
And only spread her legs to let me hit once, yeah
What you gonna say, I'm lucky? Tell the public that I was so ugly
That you fuckin' had to be drunk to fuck me?
Second base, what the fuck you tell Nick, Pumpkin?
The second week we were dry humpin', that's gotta count for somethin'
Listen, girly, surely you don't want me to talk
About how I nutted early 'cause I ejaculated prematurely
And bust all over your belly and you almost started hurling
And said I was gross, go get a towel, your stomach's curling
Or maybe you do, but if I'm embarrassin' me
I'm embarrassin' you and don't you dare say it isn't true
As long as that song's gettin' airplay, I'm dissin' you
I'm a hair away from gettin' carried away and gettin' sued
I was gonna stop at sixteen, that was thirty-two
This is thirty-four bars, we ain't even third of the way through
Damn Slim, Mariah played you, Mariah who?
Oh did I say "whore," Nick? I meant a liar too
Like I've been goin' off on you all this time
For no reason, girl, you out your alcoholic mind
Check your wine cellar, look at the amounts of all the wine
Like I fuckin' sit around and think about you all the time
I just think this shit is funny when I pounce you on a rhyme
But fuck it, now I'm 'bout to draw the line
And for you to cross it that's a mountain that I doubt you wanna climb
I can describe areas of your house you wouldn't find
On an episode of Cribs, a blow below the ribs
If I hear another word so don't go openin' your jibs
'Cause every time you do it's like an overload of fibs
I ain't sayin' this shit again, ho, you know what it is
It's a warning shot, 'fore I blow up your whole spot
Call my bluff and I'll release every fuckin' thing I got
Includin' the voicemails right before you flipped your top
When me and Luis were tryin' to stick two CDs in the same slot

[Interlude: Mariah Carey]
Slim Shady, artful dodger
Slim Shady, artful dodger

[Verse 2: Eminem & Mariah Carey]
(I love you) I love you, too
Let me whisper sweet nothings into your ear, boo
Now what you say? (It's nothing) Yeah so what I'll do
Is refresh your memory when you said (I want you)
Now should I keep goin' or should we call truce?
(You think you're cute, right?) You bet your sweet ass I do
(I'm Mary Poppins, baby) And I'm Superman, ooh
(Mary P; Slim Shady) Comin' at you
So if you'll still be my (Baby girl)
Then I'll still be your (Superhero)
(Oh and Em?) Yeah, I'm right here
(You like this) Nope, not anymore dear
It cuts like a (Knife) when I tell you get a (Life)
But I'm movin' on with mine, Nick, 'cause that's your (Wife)
Well tell her to shut her mouth then I'll leave her alone
If she don't (Stick to the script) then I'ma just keep goin'
Damn

[Outro: Mariah Carey]
I see Mary Ann, Mary Ann's saying cut the tape
Cut the tape, knife

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Life on the rocks
Too hard to swallow
So we get high till it feel like the sky low
Ya’ll boys just a bunch of pussy cats, Milo
Money is the song
Pockets on high note
Do Re Mi Fa So
I rock like a fossil
Big boss shit, Paul Castellano
Shoot your ass up, now crawl out the condo
That's that nine nigga ughh, Rondo
Sleeping with the enemy, so I fuck the world
To Miss Louise Anna, the sweetest southern girl
The sweetest southern girl, sweetest southern girl

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
This is times up
Put your signs up
They done picked my dude
Out the line up
Baby what the fuck is wrong with them
What the fuck is wrong with them
You see many you call
Very few are chosen
Looking at the wall
You can feel them close in
Baby what the fuck is wrong with them
What the fuck is wrong with them

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Mind over matter, money over all
The world is on my shoulders
Should I dust my shoulders off?
Uzi rat-a-tatter, knocking over walls
Fuck the bullshit but just don’t fuck it raw
Man pussy has a pattern and I know where I’m going
And if you got beef I turn it to a tenderloin
Sanity kills so I live the crazy life
I wonder if they'll pay attention if I change the price
Life is my wife, till death do us part
Man I’m fly as fuck, you ain't even next to depart
Quick draw McGraw, I hope you like art

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
This is times up
Put your signs up
They done picked my dude
Out the line up
Baby what the fuck is wrong with them
What the fuck is wrong with them
You see many you call
Very few are chosen
Looking at the wall
You can feel them close in
Baby what the fuck is wrong with them
What the fuck is wrong with them

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Stepping on the bullshit, you can be my doormat
Y’all ain't going nowhere with that hating shit, four flat
Disrespectful on the beat, Borat
Fuck the system and the pussy wasn’t all that
Yeah, now time’s getting shorter
Red Light on your head like a fucking recorder now
Don't you cross me, you do better crossing the border
So much money piled up, I’m a motherfucking hoarder

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
This is times up
Put your signs up
They done picked my dude
Out the line up
Baby what the fuck is wrong with them
What the fuck is wrong with them
You see many you call
Very few are chosen
Looking at the wall
You can feel them close in
Baby what the fuck is wrong with them
What the fuck is wrong with them

[Intro]
I pledge allegiance to the flag
Of the United States of America
And to the republic for which it stands (People)
One nation, under God, indivisible
With liberty and justice for all (It feels so good to be back)
(Mosh with me now)

[Verse 1]
Scrutinize every word, memorize every line
I spit it once, refuel, re-energize, and rewind
I give sight to the blind, my insight through the mind
I exercise my right to express when I feel it's time
It's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as
I say to fight, you take it as "I'ma whip someone's ass"
And if you don't understand, don't even bother to ask
A father who has grown up with a fatherless past
Who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has
Or at least shows no difficulty multitaskin'
And juggling both, perhaps mastered his craft slash
Entrepreneur who's helped launch a few more rap acts
Who's had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
Of his career, typical manure, movin' past that
Mr. Kiss-His-Ass-Crack, he's a class act
Rubber Band Man, yeah, he just snaps back

[Chorus]
Come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel, we gon' fight, we gon' charge
We gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors, come on

[Verse 2]
All the people up top, on the side and the middle
Come together, let's all form and swarm just a little
Just let it gradually build from the front to the back
All you can see is a sea of people, some white and some black
Don't matter what color, all that matters we're gathered together
To celebrate for the same cause no matter the weather
If it rains, let it rain, yeah, the wetter, the better
They ain't gon' stop us, they can't, we're stronger now more than ever
They tell us no, we say yeah, They tell us stop, we say go
Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell, we gon' let 'em know
Stomp, push, shove, mush, fuck Bush
Until they bring our troops home, come on, just

[Chorus]
Come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel, we gon' fight, we gon' charge
We gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors, come on

[Verse 3]
Imagine it pourin', just rainin' down on us
Moshpits outside the Oval Office
Someone's tryna tell us somethin', maybe this is God just
Sayin' we're responsible for this monster, this coward
That we have empowered, this is Bin Laden
Look at his head noddin'
How could we allow somethin' like this without pumpin' our fists?
Now this is our final hour
Let me be the voice and your strength and your choice
Let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
Try to amplify it, times it, and multiply it by six
'Teen million people all equal at this high pitch
Maybe we can reach Al-Qaeda through my speech
Let the president answer a higher anarchy
Strap him with an AK-47, let him go
Fight his own war, let him impress daddy that way
No more blood for oil
We got our own battles to fight on our own soil
No more psychological warfare
To trick us to thinkin' that we ain't loyal
If we don't serve our own country, we're patronizin' a hero
Look in his eyes, it's all lies
The stars and stripes have been swiped, washed out, and wiped
And replaced with his own face, mosh now or die
If I get sniped tonight, you'll know why
'Cause I told you to fight

[Chorus]
So come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel, we gon' fight, we gon' charge
We gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors, come on

[Outro: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
And as we proceed
To mosh through this desert storm
And these closing statements
If they should argue, let us beg to differ
As we set aside our differences
And assemble our own army
To disarm this weapon of mass destruction
That we call our president for the present
And mosh for the future of our next generation
To speak and be heard
Mr. President, Mr. Senator
Can you guys hear us?

Uhh.. uhh
Uhh.. uhh

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning!

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Wake up Mr. West, Mr. West
Mr. Fresh, Mister, by himself he's so impressed
I mean damn, did you even see the test?
You got D's, muthafucka D's, Rosie Perez
And yer ass barely passed any and every class
Looking at every ass, cheated on every test
I guess, this is my dissertation
Homie this shit is basic, welcome to Graduation

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning!

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Good morning, on this day we become legendary
Everything we dreamed of
I'm like the fly Malcolm X, buy any jeans necessary
Detroit Red cleaned up
From the streets to the league, from an eighth to a key
But you graduate when you make it up outta the streets
From the moments of pain, look how far we done came
Haters saying you changed, now you doing your thang

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning and—
Good morning!

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Good morning and look at the valedictorian
Scared of the future while I hop in the DeLorean
Scared to face the world, complacent career student
Some people graduate, but be still stupid
They tell you read this, eat this, don't look around
Just peep this, preach this, teach us, Jesus
Okay look up now, they done stole yo' streetness
After all of that you received this

[Bridge: Kanye West & JAY-Z]
Good morning!
Hustlers that's if you're still living, get on down
Every time that we hear them
Good morning!
Hustlers that's if you're still living, get on down
Every time that we hear them
Good morning!
Hustlers that's if you're still living, get on down
Every time that we hear them
Good morning!
Hustlers that's if you're still living, get on down

[Outro: JAY-Z]
Get on down
Get— get on down
Get on down
Get— get on down

[Verse 1]
Robert's got a quick hand
He'll look around the room, he won't tell you his plan
He's got a rolled cigarette
Hanging out his mouth, he's a cowboy kid
Yeah, he found a six-shooter gun
In his dad's closet with a box of fun things
I don't even know what
But he's coming for you, yeah, he's coming for you, wait

[Chorus]
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run faster than my bullet

[Verse 2]
Daddy works a long day
He be coming home late, and he's coming home late
And he's bringing me a surprise
'Cause dinner's in the kitchen and it's packed in ice
I've waited for a long time
Yeah, the sleight of my hand is now a quick-pull trigger
I reason with my cigarette
And say, "Your hair's on fire, you must've lost your wits," yeah

[Chorus]
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run faster than my bullet

[Bridge]
Run, run, run, run
Ru-ru-ru-run, run, run
Ru-ru-ru-ru-run, run, run, run
Ru-ru-ru-run
Run, run, ru-run, run

[Chorus]
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run faster than my bullet

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Better strap up your boots
Before they start to shoot
Then do it for the troops
It’s Young Money salute

[Verse 1: Lil' Twist]
So sick with the flow
Yeah your cowboys know that Lil Twist
Been a pro way before Romo or T.O
No Witten, Cowboys to a Piston
A.I., no Wallace, your kids gettin' demolished
I’m bookin' on your suckers like I'm just leaving college
But smart, very smart - too smart for your knowledge
Too smart once more, Wayne called me a genius
It’s YME, nothin' gets in between us

[Verse 2: Lil' Chuckee]
Tell Wayne I’m goin' in like somebody bout to bury me
In this rap game, nobody could ever bury me
That's why you see me on stage rockin' with Young Money
I told my team I got us man, it’s all on me
Like Volume two B.G., I got my crew with me
Twist, Mack, Millz, Gudda and my baby Nicki
Every time I’m on the track it’s ransom
Can’t find us anymore, it’s random
When Young Money come through you better salute us

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Better strap up your boots
Before they start to shoot
Then do it for the troops
It’s Young Money salute

[Verse 3: Jae Millz]
Hey I solemnly swear if it ever go down
You ain't never got to call me cause I’mma be there
Let's get to the point like elbows, my crew harder than shell toes
Strapped like Velcro and is we running hell no
And truthfully, aimin' for number one, oh do we
You ask why I reply 'cause nobody remember two or three
Cross YM out of him we'll make a movie
We all we can be, respect the army and salute we

[Verse 4: Gudda Gudda]
Young Money army, we marching
We coming forward, no warning
We got these boys running like Forrest
So salute me like a general
First place, never last
Always on top and I’m a chief like a Seminole
Got the game in a stranglehold​ no letting up
You can get the top of your can popped like 7-Up
Knock knock let us up, Young Money applaud me
And we’ll take the game out your hands like a joy stick

[Verse 5: Nicki Minaj]
I’ma need my badges and my ribbons
Maybe it will make up for everything that I wasn’t given
Everything that I’ve given, I swear I’ll never give in
Just look at what I’ve been in and this is just the beginning
I d-d-do it cause I did it for my ballerina girls
Blowing kisses to the soldiers, I am Marilyn Monroe
But we shoot shoot shoot em up, camouflage me
Cause Young Money is the Navy better yet the Army

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Better strap up your boots
Before they start to shoot
Then do it for the troops
It’s Young Money salute

[Verse 6: Lil Wayne]
Commander-in-Chief
One hand on the World, one hand on the brief
I stand on the world, bitch I stand on the peak
Of the game, and the girls, and the guap, now that's G
Don’t ask me about shit but money
Fuckin’ right my money long I got that 10-foot money
I get it fast when I get to the money
When I walk, it sounds like 10 foots running
I meant feet, I’m in deep like wet pussy
I’m a purple heart proven war vet, rookie
You can’t even sit next to me
Now bring money or death to me, or don’t step to me
Now don’t step nigga, march with me
To the steps of the court building
Like ain’t we God’s children?
I know at all times gods feel me
So I play my part until the war kill me
Salute - or shoot

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Better strap up your boots
Before they start to shoot
Then do it for the troops
It’s Young Money salute

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Leggo, Ok

Weezy F. Baby, born in a manger
Trouble is my friend, I ain’t foreign to danger
Clip full of wings, turn you boys into angels
Shoot you in your halo, shoot you like Halo
New Orleans a-hole; frio, fuego
All about my bread like bagels, they know
I’m raw like Quaaludes

Weed so strong it’s like I twist tornadoes
Spit like nines, four-fifths, and three-eight-0s
Niggas want problems, well I am problematic

Which one of y’all niggas say you bout it
It’s a fucked up world T-Streets take you out it
That’s word to the Glock
Glock in the sock
Loose lips sink ships, better stop at the dock
Hol' up

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Married to the money, you welcome to the reception
And she came with problems; fuck it, that’s my stepsons
Sleeping in the Maybach, wake me when the jet come
And I keep the toast, turn your ass to bread crumbs, uh
Based on a true story
I got a million flows, they ain’t even two stories
Sleeping on the edge, I hope I don’t toss and turn
Shoot down the early bird, and that’s how I get the worm
Yeah, Real Nigga University Alumni
Just checked my watch, and that bitch said sometimes
She say when I’m in her, it feel like I’m soul-searching
And they say money talks, well it’s my spokesperson, uh
Grab a star from the sunroof
I fuck her in her dreams, and make her come true
Yeah, Young Money and the power
Send my B's at you, like a motherfucking flower

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
I read the news today—oh, boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book

[Refrain: John Lennon]
I'd love to turn you on
(Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten)
*alarm clock rings*

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

[Interlude: John Lennon]
Ahh-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ahh

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
I read the news today—oh, boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall

[Refrain: John Lennon]
I'd love to turn you on

[Instrumental Outro]

*whistle*
*studio chatter*

[Sample]
One more beer
And I'll take you all
All of you

[Intro]
Banned from all bars
The man with seven scars

[Verse 1]
Smack it up, flip it, pulled out, 'bout to fell
Sunday in the ATL and I'm all outta ale
Like a bat out of hell, tripped on a cat tail
Mutt drinkin out a pail, who let the rat out the cell?
Got all the ingredients and recipe, might as well
Since last week, the bootlegger been in jail
If all else fail, inhale the L
Makin' sure they can't see your sale via snail mail
Mind like a sewer, servin' rhyme on a skewer
DOOM'll step to a fine dime like he knew her
"My black sister!" She said, "Step back!" before he kissed her
She did the dipper and the smack just missed her
There go a list of politics like Henry Kissinger
99% of rap's just a friendly listener
I'm like, "These dudes must have some screws loose to hate y'all"
Or a couple of ounces short of deuce-deuce or 8 Ball
Y'all know it's time for the end when the day come
Buy a album, get rudely insulted over fake drums
Same CDs you get for free, you break 'em
Wa-alaikum, make 'em eat they food like Steak-umm
Why she wanna ask me if I could pass the paprika?
One hand on the mic, the other on the beaker
Every week or so, peeked out the lab though, eureka!
A technique to keep somethin' uniquer in ya speaker
For yo' information, I didn't do the beat, y'all
It ain't my fault if she didn't move her feet at all
Skeeter, robbed Peter to pay Paul
So he could trick it on Mary so she can play ball

[Chorus]
She better have my skrilla
Cut it out with all that funny hand jive, will ya?
All this trouble for a tall glass of Olde E
Drink it all fast and make you haul ass slowly
Remind me to remember what you told me
Holy moly, did you get a load of her roly-poly?
Yo, G, remind me to remember what you told me
Whoever don't feel him, feel balls like a goalie

[Verse 2]
One for the money, two for the better green
3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine
Told the knock-kneed ghetto queen, "Get the head fiend"
Tell him it's from Medellin and use oxyacetylene
Who needs airplay? It's all just hearsay
Leave a wig like it was having a bad hair day
Miracle glide master, asked him what's his secret
He said, "Shasta, it turns to formaldehyde faster"
When I'm home with my lady, I try to duke her daily
One night, she tried to flail me with her ukulele
Pack your heat, the Villain on the cover of Black Beat
With a bunch of crackers and some snack meat

[Chorus]
They better have my skrilla
Cut it out with all that funny hand jive, will ya?
All this trouble for a tall glass of Olde E
Drink it all fast and make you haul ass slowly
Remind me to remember what you told me
Holy moly, did you get a load of her roly-poly?
Yo, G, remind me to remember what you told me

[Intro Skit]
(Narrator): Running desperately low on food, they were forced to turn back
(Interjection): Well I'll be!
(Interjection 2): What's that villain doing?

(Voice 1): Wait princess, your voice sounds familiar
(Princess): Well it should. You see, DOOM wants me to marry him (What?)
But after seeing what he has done to our peaceful world, I despise him. He intends to destroy all of us if I persist in refusing him, even now

[Verse 1: Angelika/StaHHr]
Sheitan never came so ill, he got skill
Met a brother from the grill that gave my spine chills
All thirty three nerves, controlling my curves
Common sense just swerved every time I got served
Stress, frustration, empty rhetoric
Cold as winter in Connecticut, compassion lacking deficit
Thought it was love like, sent from above, you not a soulmate
More ways and actions of a primate
Who by low and census coming faker than extensions
Pissed away all good intentions, outta here sister was missin'
Intuition, maybe it was me, I couldn't see
Holding onto fantasy, getting bitten by reality

[Hook: 4ize]
War wound, purple heart, love veteran
Morphine, pain killers, drugs and medicine
Anything just to forget the hurt
Incoming! Take cover, hit the dirt
On the front-line, there's casualties in the mind
And the POW's get left behind
Mentally scarred for life, love is war
And some chicks are just too hard to wife

[Verse 2: Angelika/StaHHr]
I shoulda deaded it from genesis instead of hittin' the Guinnesses
Now I'm free falling, cursing at the street, bawling
He ceased calling, no appetite for feast darling
So deep all in, I bet he never stop balling women
Forsake God for the sin of a man
Sacrifice a whole life for a slice, overstand?
Maybe it's a lack of pigment, loneliness imagine figment
Only got the car tinted to pull extra G's in it
Damn Jody, comin with the okie doke, pokie poke
Steady rockin boats, got me aimin for ya throats
Sniper scope, weren't we supposed to elope?
Propose then ya froze, I don't think that I can cope

[Hook: 4ize]
War wound, purple heart, love veteran
Morphine, pain killers, drugs and medicine
Anything just to forget the hurt
Incoming! Take cover, hit the dirt
On the front-line, there's casualties in the mind
And the POW's get left behind
Mentally scarred for life, love is war
And some chicks are just too hard to wife

[Verse 3: Angelika/StaHHr]
Constant frustration, stemming from a no-win situation
Rushing lust and fornication adding to the complication
Patience is a virtue, pain run deep when love desert you
Listenin' to whisperin', choosing chaos over discipline
Simpleton, life should really be a piece of Entenmann’s
Relationships strengthening, flower essence: Penstemon
Gentlemen, my favorite shit, so I've never forsaken it
I persevere, make it fit, sculpting and reshaping it
Taking sips off a fifth of it, passionate
Intense, incense candles lit, scandalous
Emotional bandages, why would he abandon this?
Guess he couldn't handle it, the boss is magnanimous

[Hook: 4ize]
War wound, purple heart, love veteran
Morphine, pain killers, drugs and medicine
Anything just to forget the hurt
Incoming! Take cover, hit the dirt
On the front-line, there's casualties in the mind
And the POW's get left behind
Mentally scarred for life, love is war
And some chicks are just too hard to wife

[Outro Skit]
(Interjection): Oh boy here we go!
(Voice): How come all you college boys wear them faggotty-looking white shoes, they look funny as hell. Ah looks like she got burnt laces
(Bert): You didn't wash your neck. Sometimes we don't wash our necks, but that's ok
(Ernie): Oh I washed my neck. Take-take a look at my neck

(Misc. Voice): Hold it right there you!
(DOOM): Where you are going, there are no jokes

(Spiderman): I'm beginning to think that armor plated Gargoyle doesn't like me

Metal Face 2
Operation Doomsday
You were very high

[Verse 1: MF DOOM]
By the way, I re-up on bad dreams, bag up screams in fiftys
Be up on mad schemes that heat shop like jiffy (Pop-pop)
In a instant, get smoked like Winston Cigarettes
Hoes get ripped off like Nicorette (Patch)
In real life, the real trife scene
Might snatch ya life like assault machine
Rifle, dead-up setup like bull-fight
Be blunted how we like couldn't white or in full flight
The unemotional, call me anti-social
On the run, off the gun death tally commercial
Death valley is like rehearsal to the streets
To my peeps G.M., MF on the beat
Rhymes is chosen like the weapons of war
So keep from steppin' on my floor or delivery front-door
I bring it to ya'll motherfuckers, master yours
My disaster cause.. Hell, in gas drawls
The supervillain cooler than a million, I be chillin'
Still quick to slice squares like Sicilians
Don't make me have to hurt them feelings
I'll ruin you in the dirt that I be doin' in my dealings
(While I'm) Sendin' spirits through the ceilin', chrome peelin'
Dome blown within the comforts of your own home
Grown big, wheelin' and high rollin'
I hold the lye, it keeps the sty on my eye swollen
Holdin', foldin' the pal
Known as massive-versatile
I’d like to big-them-up Monsta Isle

[Break: MF DOOM]
Uummm, yeah
I saw you in Hell with them gas drawls
Mhm

[Verse 2: MF DOOM]
To my brother Subroc and Black Ju, I crack brew for
Two more, three men, two up
I hit the brew up like nobody knows how X the unseen feels
When givin' crews a brush with death like between meals
Two times a day with brothers that's tight like a noose
With more rhymes in use than Dr. Seuss
Or motherfuckin' Mother Goose
X the suspicious flirter who every hooker heard'a
Next to malicious murda
A track type vicious, fulfillin' the pipe wishes
The misses may be legal, minus the baby eagle
Any given summer's eve, don't breathe
Sixteen shots, I do believe, and one up the sleeve
Master of the O who predict ya last pause
I told y'all, Hell and gas drawls
Breakin' glass and plastic jaw like federal drastic law
Fed up from fightin' secret war wit' them Fantastic Four
(Invisible Bitch)
Versus Doom wit' the metal face
Before I go to state, the hoe better settle case
The flow is at pedal pace, steady like tricycles
Beware all suckas is froze like icicles (Bag 'em up)
And baggin' bitches like nickels 'cause I lick 'em where they tickle
Before I hit the clit though, I'mma split 'til I pronounce
More hits than a ounce, no doubt
About ta' bounce, X the unannounced, I'm out

[Outro: MF DOOM]
And I like to give a shoutout to the brother Jet Jaguar
Megalon and King Geedorah
I call this joint right here Gas Drawls
In Hell with yours

[Intro: André 3000]
One, two, three, uh!

[Verse 1: André 3000]
My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so, and this I know for sure (Uh)
But does she really wanna
But can't stand to see me walk out the door? (Ah)
Don't try to fight the feeling
'Cause the thought alone is killing me right now (Uh)
Thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking two together 'cause we don't know how (C'mon)

[Chorus: André 3000]
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!
Hey ya! Hey ya!

[Verse 2: André 3000]
You think you've got it, oh, you think you've got it
But "got it" just don't get it till there's nothing at all (Ah!)
We get together, oh, we get together
But separate's always better when there's feelings involved (Ah)
If what they say is, "Nothing is forever"
Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes, what makes, what makes love the exception?
So why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh, why oh
Are we so in denial when we know we're not happy here?
Y'all don't wanna hear me, you just wanna dance

[Chorus: André 3000]
Hey ya! (Uh-oh) Hey ya! (Uh-oh)
Don't want to meet your daddy
Hey ya! (Uh-oh)
Just want you in my Caddy (Uh-oh)
Hey ya! (Uh-oh)
Don't want to meet your mama (Uh-oh)
Hey ya! (Uh-oh)
Just want to make you cum-a' (Uh-oh)
Hey ya! (Uh-oh)
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm just being honest (Uh-oh)
Hey ya!
I'm just being honest

[Bridge 1: André 3000]
Hey, all right now, all right now, fellas (Yeah?)
Now, what's cooler than being cool? (Ice Cold!)
I can't hear ya
I say what's, what's cooler than being cool? (Ice Cold!)
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right
Okay now, ladies (Yeah?)
Now, we gon' break this thing down in just a few seconds
Now, don't have me break this thing down for nothing
Now, I want to see y'all on your baddest behavior
Lend me some sugar, I am your neighbor
Ah, here we go!

[Refrain: André 3000]
Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it, sh-shake it (Uh-oh)
Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it, shake it, sh-shake it (Uh-oh)
Shake it like a Polaroid picture, hey ya!
Shake it, sh-shake it, shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, shake it (Okay), shake it, sugar
Shake it like a Polaroid picture

[Bridge 2: André 3000]
Now, all the Beyoncés and Lucy Lius
And baby dolls, get on the floor
You know what to do, oh, you know what to do
You know what to do

[Chorus: André 3000]
Hey ya! (Uh-oh) Hey ya! (Uh-oh)
Hey ya! (Uh-oh) Hey ya! (Uh-oh, hey ya!)
Hey ya! (Uh-oh) Hey ya! (Oh, oh, uh-oh)
Hey ya! (Uh-oh) Hey ya! (Uh-oh)
Hey ya! Hey ya!

[Verse 1]
I remember when, last past November when
Clown kid got pounded in with the Timberlands
They left him trembling, he was not remembering:
Never tuck your denim in just to floss an emblem
Some would debate, "Wait, the fella ate gelatin
Or he been listening in to what his weathermens was telling him"
When I could feel it in my melanin, it's compelling
Us to break them off, no reassembling
No science-fiction to no theater near you, coming soon to
Fuck with you frequently like how phases of the moon would do
You could gather 'round like it was an eclipse
Just don't look directly to the bitch, you may be blinded by the scripts
Pass the L, the last to tussle in them shirttails
All hail, King Geedorah, the third rail
700 volts holds rap to a standstill
Fool ignore the rule, fuck up and get his man killed
Two bottles of Dom got his hands filled
And so goes the days of our lives as the hourglass sand spill
And built with Passion and a glass of the 'Ze
(And the lights went down and hey!)

[Hook]
And I knew it was the last day - Wig-Twisting Season
When some could get their wigs twisted back within reason
Mostly with these crimes of treason
And you'll be lucky if there's no squeezing even this evening

[Verse 2]
From how he's feeling, thrilling choice of flow is sick
He's the villain with the million dollar voice-throw trick
He's like a ventriloquist, with his fist in the speaker's back
Couldn't think of no uniquer track, nope, sneak attack
It don't really matter how big them is. So much as a nipple
Cause you could have a chick with D-Triple
'Cept the nipple little, just hot off the griddle
Like how he do monkey rhymers, like Monkey-in-the-Middle by his damn self
Ain't no average MC ahead of me
Getting cheddar instead of the probably better pedigree
With nicknames, sick games as Rick James
Messy games, Sci Fly such as Jesse James
Blast, I figure, ass-hawking ass titty licker
Last one to walk up in, fast-talking city slicker
Got bagged cause of the dirty chick with make-up
Bail out quick for the 7:30 wake-up
My only backup was an A-cup, as far as May
To when the leaves turn red and gold to Nimrod earthday
All else? Worthless to say
(And the lights went down and hey!)

[Hook]
That's when I knew it was the first day - Wig-Twisting Season
When some could get their wigs twisted back within reasoning
Mostly with these crimes of treason men
And y'all be lucky if there's no squeezing even this evening

[Verse 3]
It's like a mosquito, the much sweeter resent the act
I been bent back since my Physical went back
Since, Cultured more of my kin
And for them I keep an L rolled in this hellhole
Hold your head, use your head and hold, or be dead and cold
In the worsest way, soon as the leaves show red and gold
To 'round Nimrod release day
And all else? Needless to say
Wait a motherfucking minute! True facts presented
The names was probably changed just to protect who ain't in it
The XP was three-quarters tinted, 4/5ths was converted
The way his shit was twisted? Ask him if it hurted

[Hook]
Wig-Twisting Season
When some could get their wigs twisted back within reasoning
Mostly with these crimes of lying, and fronting, and cheating
All types of different styles of treason

[Produced by MF DOOM]

[Intro: MF DOOM + sample]
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
("Hey!")
I'd like to thank you all for joining us this evening
Let me know if y'all with me, y'all
("Hey!")
Just a couple of things I wanna say

[Verse]
I only play the games that I win at
And stay the same with more rhymes than there's ways to skin cats
As a matter of fact, let me rephrase:
With more rhymes than there's ways to fillet felines these days
Watch the path of the black one: Supervillian
He wrecks clubs for delf in a drunken stupor, chillin'
Ready and willin' to inadvertently foil that
Plan of any rhymer, whiner or spoiled brat
Who got more snottier flows than snotty nose?
And holds mics like he knows karate body blows?
Nobody knows the trouble I see
From the MPV fly dirty tailin' the eye bubble eye thirty
For the record; this is some shit I just thought of, y'all
Science fiction that's not admissible ("Hey!") in no court of law
I live to rock mics 3-D
The only reason I seek to stop—to snuff the TV
I heard beats, they sound like karaoke
With monkey rhymers on a leash like don't have this fairy choke me
Hit 'em with a penny so we can get these peanuts
And I thought we was nuts, I used to get free cuts
They locks Lex Luthor up in Green Haven
Since when a nigga never really been too clean shaven
Misbehavin' rap stars need Listamint
Call me Mista Bent
I'm at where your sister went
Intelligent, used to write and be well spoke
Now all a nigga wanna do is fight and sell—("Hey!")
—tell a joke
This could lead to catastrophe
'Bout to stop the violence right after these last of three
Shots from the black bat got me at headlock
Holdin' on to sanity, by strands of that dreadlock
She told me, "Get off," I said, "Bitch!
Let me set this shit off so I can get rich right quick"
Then it hit me like the point of intoxication
Nigga, come out and rock this nation like ("Hey!") ox defacin'
A lot of niggas out is rusty like oxidation
In this world's strangest, most dangerous occupation
But you could do it, you the Super like in your building
Villian like trife Kinder is in All My Children
Plottin' and it sure to pay ends
With some real mature womens, and some more of they friends ("Hey!")
And when bad men roll tight, it's actual true
Like a pack of Big Bambú, with natural glue
Who grip necks of Becks to triple X?
He just came in 4-D: Follow the ripple effects
And it'll lead you right to him
Oh, snap!
It seems you walked into a trap, through rap
Zoinks!
This place is filled with pretender willies
One false move, and get broke off like end of Phillies
True believers
Ain't nothin new to a
Crook with special powers like how to tell the future uh-uh-
Rhyme of the month two page long
Bustin' off two gages with my cape on wrong
Son, it's on, remind me of a Raekwon tape song
With a fleet of super bad... Status: Rae Dawn Chong
Let me know if y'alls with me, y'all! ("Hey!")
National and geographic down to the titty-bar
Rep Monster Island City, y'all!
To all my brothers who is doin' unsettlin' bids
You could have got away with it if it was not for them
Meddlin' kids!
("Over here!")

[Outro: Sample]
"Hey!"
"Hey!"

[Verse 1]
I'ma get on this TV, mama
I'ma, I'ma put shit down
I'ma make sure these light-skinned niggas
Never, ever, never come back in style
Told 'em I finished school and I started my own business
They say, "Oh you graduated?" No, I decided I was finished
Chasing y'all dreams and what you've got planned
Now I spit it so hot, you got tanned
Back to school and I hate it there, I hate it there
Everything I want, I gotta wait a year, I wait a year
This nigga graduated at the top of our class
I went to Cheesecake, he was a motherfucking waiter there

[Chorus]
Alpha, step, Omega, step

[Verse 2]
I got a Jones like Norah for your soror
Bring more of them girls, I've seen in The Aurora
Tammy, Becky, and Laura, or a Shirley
I'm trying to hit it early, like I'm in a hurry
See, that's how dude became the young Pootie Tang: "tippy tow"
Roc-A-Fella chain, yeah, that's my rapper style
Rosary piece, yeah, that's my Catholic style
Red and white Ones, yeah, that's my Kappa style
And I ain't even pledge
Crack my head on the steering wheel and I ain't even dead
If I could go through all that and still be breathing
Bitch, bend over, I'm here for a reason

[Chorus]
Alpha, step, Omega, step
Kappa, step, Sigma, step
Gangstas walk, pimps gon' talk
Ooh, hecky nah, that boy is raw

I feel a woo coming on, cuz
I feel a woo coming on, cuz
(WOO!)
There it was
A couple woos coming on, cuz
A couple woos coming on, cuz
(WOO! WOO!)
There they was

[Intro: Jay-Z]
Oh baby
Turn the motherfuckin' music up

[Chorus]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Yo, first I snatched the streets, then I snatched the charts
First I had they ear, now I have they heart
Rappers came and went, I've been here from the start
I seen them put it together, watched them take it apart
Seen the Rovers roll up with ribbons
I seen them re-po'd, re-sold, then re-driven
So when I reload, he holds number one position
When you hot, I'm hot
And when your feet cold, mines is sizzling
It's plain to see, niggas can't fuck with me
'Cause I'ma be that nigga for life
This is not an image, this is God-given
This is hard-livin', mixed with Cristal sippin'
It's the most consistent, Hov
Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
Nigga I'm home on these charts, y'all niggas visitin'
It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordon of rap
I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy

[Chorus]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I get down for my grandfather who took my momma
Made her sit in that seat where white folks ain't want us to eat
At the tender age of 6, she was arrested for the sit-ins
And with that in my blood I was born to be different
Now niggas can't make it to ballots to choose leadership
But we can make it to Jacob's or to the dealership
That's why I hear new music and I just don't be feelin' it
Racism still alive, they just be concealin' it
But I know they don't want me in the damn club
They even made me show ID to get inside of Sam's Club
I done did dirt and went to church to get my hands scrubbed
Swear I've been baptized 'least three or four times
But in the land where niggas praise Yukons and getting paid
It's gon' take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than durags to get you waves
Nothing sad as that day my girl father passed away
So I promised to Mr. Rainey, I'm gonna marry your daughter
And you know I gotta thank you for the way that she was brought up
And I know that you were smiling when you seen the car I bought her
And you sent tears from heaven when you seen my car get balled up
But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye
'Cause look what an accident did to Left Eye
First Aaliyah now Romeo must die
I know I got angels watching me from the other side

[Chorus]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I've found, one thing I found
Oh no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down
Get up, I get down, get up, I get down

[Verse 3: J. Ivy]
We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you a part of the math
Cats think I'm delirious but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe, the world
I'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual
My spirit is a part of this that's why I get spiritual
But I get my hymns from Him
So it's not me, it's He that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven-sent instrument
My rhythmatic regiment navigates melodic notes for your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental, vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah I need my loot by rent day
But that ain't what gives me the heart of Kunta Kinte
I'm trying to get us "us free" like Cinque
I can't stop, that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you of my many inspirations
When I say I can't let you or self down
If I were on the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And if you slipped off the side and clinched on to your life
In my grip, I would never ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it be known that God's penmanship has been signed with a language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the deaf
And while my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I too dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
'Cause whenever I open my heart, my soul or my mouth
A touch of God reigns out
Take 'em to church

[Chorus]
When it comes to being true, at least true to me
One thing I found, one thing I found
Oh no, you'll never let me down
Get up, I get, get up, I get
Get up, I get, get up, I get
Get up, I get, get up, I get down

[Verse 4: Jay-Z & (Kanye West)]
Who else you know been hot this long?
(Oh yeah, we ain't finished)
Started from nothing but he got this strong
(The Roc is in the building)
Built the Roc from a pebble, peddled rock before I met you
Pedaled bikes, got my nephews pedal bikes because they special (Wooooo)
Let you tell it, man, I'm falling
Well, somebody must have caught him
'Cause every fourth quarter, I like to Mike Jordan 'em
Number one albums, what I got? Like four of them
More of them on the way, the eighth wonder on the way
Clear the way, I'm here to stay
Y'all can save the chitter chat, this and that
This is Jay, dissing Jay will get you maced
When I start spitting them lyrics niggas get very religious
Six Hail Marys, 'Please Father forgive us'
Young, the archbishop, the Pope John Paul of y'all niggas
The way y'all all follow Jigga
Hov's a living legend and I'll tell you why
Everybody wanna be Hov and Hov's still alive

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Well, I stand up next to a mountain
And I chop it down with the edge of my hand
Well, I stand up next to a mountain
And I chop it down with the edge of my hand
Well, I pick up all the pieces and make an island
Might even raise a little sand
Yeah

[Chorus]
Because I'm a voodoo child
Lord knows I'm a voodoo child, baby

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 2]
I want to say one more last thing
I didn't mean to take up all your sweet time
I'll give it right back to ya one of these days, hahah
I said, I didn't mean to take up all your sweet time
I'll give it right back one of these days, oh yeah
If I don't meet you no more in this world
Then I'll meet you in the next one
And don't be late
Don't be late

[Chorus]
Because I'm a voodoo child, voodoo child
Lord knows I'm a voodoo child, baby

[Intro]
Yeah, hey
Gucci always talkin' 'bout he love somebody
He don't love nobody (Uh-uh)
Matter fact, nigga, you owe me some money don't you?
Let me show you how I do this shit (Get money)

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Yellow Benz with a spoiler kit, with my spoiled lil' chick
Yellow diamonds on my neck and wrist, match this yellow bitch
She a trip, shawty, she the shit, she know she the shit
If you don't buy her what she want then she throw a fit
She a bitch, shawty, mean as shit but she super thick
And she act silly like a kid, give her candy stick
She a pit, make her flip a brick, make her sick a chick
Since a jit, I've been slangin' dick, Gucci Mane the shit (Burr)
I met a girl name Susie, I let her join my group
I know she not a groupie, so I let her in my coupe
I stashed her in my fender wall and stashed her in my tire
Susie is a money maker but that bitch a liar
Susie roll in '08 'Rari but that girl on fire
Pull us over Candler Road, said she had some priors
Ten bricks in my car, shawty singing like Mariah
Singing like the choir, better yet singing like Mya (Bitch)

[Verse 2: Ester Dean]
Well, my name is Susie and Gucci think I love him
That sucka think I'm loyal but I fucks with all the hustlas
I be wit' all the ballas, I be at all the spots
I might be in yo' kitchen, nigga, cooking with yo' pots

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & Ester Dean]
I think I love her
Nigga, you don't love me

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Told my boy, man, Polow Da Don
I think I love this girl, man, huh, why?
She sweet but keep kief, she stains her Irene
Two piece, she dime piece and jeans, they dead meat
She sweet, she so deep, she read with good teeth
Two jobs, she get cheese, her dates, are my treat
How neat, she loves to eat, we eat bon appétit
We feed, she's so neat and like me, she so neat

[Verse 4: Ester Dean]
Nigga, always talk but I run the block
This bitch is so hot, my clique, I close shop
My wrist froze with rocks, I cop all the drops
Unfold all the knots, expose the have-nots
My hoes pose with pot like young Goldilocks
We got white bulging rocks, Ziploc stocks to cop
We never closin' shop, we hot, steaming hot
I'm Susie Sarah plot, a click clack, p-pop-pop

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & Ester Dean]
I think I love her

Boi, boi, boi

[Verse 1]
I-I-I say that shit again, I said it once before

I glisten and shine with misses' fine model chick, big behind
Bad enough to skip the line but to me she just a nine
I hop up out that double-0, you can call me Mr. Bond
Bitch, I am a monster, I belong in District 9

[Refrain]
Catch me in my office, office, doing business
Fuck you doing? Bullshitting

[Verse 2]
I get all the eyes when I step inside and
They all arise when I am arrivin'
Bring out the Rose, Nuvo, Ciroc and
Bring out the OJ like Johnny Cochran

Just a million people behind me and I don't have Verizon

[Refrain]
Man, I'm chillin with my niggas nigga, and a couple cool bitches
Fuck you doin'? Bullshittin'

[Verse 2]
Me and my nigga SayItAintTone
Hundred pretty girlies singing our song

And I be blowing on that reefer you can't say that it ain't strong
And she just, she just, she just, she just want a long dick
I put it in her mouth and now that bitch look like a conehead

[Refrain]
When I'm done? Go ahead
(Nigga what the fuck?) What you thought this is?
(Hell naw) Fuck you doing? Bullshitting

[Verse 3]
I hear, I hear, I hear man but that shit just don't compare
I tell you you the best, when I'm looking in the mirror
By the time y'all over here, I'm prolly over there
And by the time you riding what I'm riding on I'm in the air
No wonder why my mind is so cloudy, I'm drowsy
My frequent flier miles is in the thousies, I'm outtie

[Refrain]
Somewhere chilling in Maui, swimming with the scuba fishes
Fuck you doing? Bullshitting

[Verse 4]
Nigga I be splargin, I beg my pardon
Cause y'all niggas is starving, looking for a bargain
Gone and roll that weed yea I think it's time to spark it
Cause I be running through them trees niggas call me Tarzan
What you think? We won't stop! Gone stop? Silly ho
I'm living out my dreams, don't you dare hit that alarm clock

[Refrain]
I'm laid up with your girlfriend

I'm still pullin' out the phantom and these haters can't stand him
Nigga I'm still doin my thing
I'm still fly I'm sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
I'm still shuttin' cities down every time I come around
Nigga I'm still doin' my thing
I'm still

[Verse]
Responsible for everything you listen to
While mediocre talent proceeds to try and condition you
Took over my city and I never asked permission to;
Started poppin' bottles cuz it's ATL tradtion to
Celebrate at Bymark, fuck 'em at the SoHo
If there ain't a elevator in it it's a no go
Coldest thing droppin' and these bitches want a snow blow
And they just give me head while the haters give me promo
And man, my DJ shoulda won that
Nelissa and Wristpect, Man the city owe us one back
All these old heads keep they minds on one track
And me, I run Toronto, holla at me when you done laps
Roll around with Niko, party with Azuka
Shout goes out to 1da, shout goes out to future
Shout goes out to Getty, motherfucker I am ready
And whoever got the torch just can't seem to hold it steady
Cuz I see the flame flickerin', ex-girls bickerin'
Got these women jockin' me from Heart Lake Road to Pickerin
Tried to send my nigga short some syrup out in Michigan
But my connect said it'd take a minute if you're listenin'
Please start doin' you, I been doin' me
And I'm a staple in my city, you can never ruin me
Rappers are emotional, critics be reviewin' me
But I got love for everybody even if you're suin' me
My brother P-Reign knows, we fuck with the same hoes
Plus he taught me how to spot a officer in plain clothes
Starin' at you pussy niggas, all I see is rainbows
Hoppin' on a jet to every single Lil Wayne show
Me and Lil Jazzy, please do not harass me
Just holla if you got me and fuck you if you had me
Shout out to Brian E, shout out to Photo Will
Shout out to Oliver and 40, man you know the deal
Shout out to Mayhem, shout out to P-Plus
The names I mention are crucial; you gonna need us
And life is good, everything is just fine
I am so sure of my rhymes
I could sacrifice a line like (mumbles)
Yeah, haha, I swear I really fuckin' does it
I had these niggas trippin', no luggage

[Chorus]
I'm still fly I'm sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
I'm still pullin' out the phantom and these haters can't stand him
Nigga I'm still doin my thing
I'm still fly I'm sky high and I dare anybody to try and cut my wings
I'm still shuttin' cities down every time I come around
Nigga I'm still doin' my thing
I'm still

[Outro]

[Intro]
Lord, please forgive me for what I do
For I know not what I've done

[Hook]
Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

[Verse 1]
Momma had a baby and its head popped off
Head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off
But Momma don't want me, the next thing I know, I'm gettin' dropped off
Gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off
Ring-ring-ring on the doorbell of the next door neighbors, on their front porch
Their front porch, their front porch, their front porch, their front porch
But they didn't want me neither, so they left me on someone else's lawn
Else's lawn, else's lawn, else's lawn
'Til somebody finally took me in, my great aunt and uncle, Edna and Charles
Edna and Charles, Edna and Charles, Edna and Charles, Edna and Charles, they were the ones who were left in charge
My elementary, they'd gang up on me and sing this song
Sing this song, sing this song, sing this song, sing this song
It went a little something like
"Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb
Debbie had a Satan spawn, Satan spawn"
Momma why do they keep sayin' this? I just don't understand, understand
And by the way, where's my dad?

[Hook]
Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

[Verse 2]
Predominantly, predominantly, everything's always predominantly
Predominantly-white, predominantly black. Well, what about me?
Where does that leave me? Well, I guess that I'm between predominantly both of 'em
I think if I hear that fuckin' word again, I'ma scream
While I'm projectile vomitin'; what do I look like, a comedian to you?
Do you think that I'm kiddin'? What do I look like, some kinda idi...
Wait a minute, shit, don't answer that; why am I so misunderstood?
Why do I go through so much bullshit? It's such bullshit, it's tush mull bish
"Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again whinin' about his millions
And his mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin' in
And the dad that he never had, and how his childhood was so bad
And how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife, how they go at it
Man, I'd hate to have it as bad as that Mr. Mathers claims he had it
I can't imagine it. That little rich, poor, white bastard
Needs to take some of that cash out of the bank and take a bath in it
Man, if I only had half of it"
Shit, if you only knew the half of it...
Haha

[Hook]
Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

[Verse 3]
Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds
Please release me from these demons
I never had any of this shit planned, Mom, please believe
I don't wanna be Satan's spawn
Never got the chance to say I'm sorry
Now look at all the pain I caused
Dear Santa Claus, why are you not comin' this year again?
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this?
Everything could have been so perfect
But life ain't a fairytale. I'm about to be hoisted up in the air
Forty feet below me there's people everywhere
I don't even know but who feel like they know me 'cause I'm in this ferris wheel
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hailie on the carousel
Without this crowd everywhere I go, but life is like a merry-go-round
Here we go now, do-si-do now, curtains up, the show must go now
Ring-around-the-rosie, the show's over, you can all go home now
But the curtain just don't close for me, this ain't how fame was supposed to be
Where's the switch I could just turn off-and-on? This ain't what I chose to be
So please, God, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on
'Til I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone

[Hook]
Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
I said, Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
(Evil deeds, evil deeds, evil deeds)

Uhh, I dream filthy

Huh, what a set off
Shoulda pushed him dead off, wipe the sweat off (uhh)
'Cause in this world I'm dead off, squeeze lead off
Benz sped off, ain't no shook hands in Brook-land
Army fatigues bring fatigue, to enemies, look man
You wanna see me locked up, shot up
Moms crouched up over the casket, screamin' "BASTARD!"
Cryin', know my friends is lyin'
Y'all know who killed him, filled him with the lugers from they Rugers
Or the Desert, dyin' ain't the shit, but it's pleasant
Kinda quiet, watch my niggas bring the riot
Givin' cats the opposite of diets
You gain thirty pounds when you die no lie, lazy eye
I was high when they hit me, took a few cats with me
Shit, I need the company (uh-huh)
Apologies in order, to T'Yanna my daughter
If it was up to me you would be with me
Sorta like Daddy Dearest, my vision be the clearest
Silencers so you can't hear it
Competition still fear it, shit don't ask me
I went from ashy to nasty to classy, and still

[Chorus: DMC]
That's not all, MC's have the gall
To pray and pray for my downfall (they pray)
Pray and pray for my downfall (they pray)
Pray and pray for my downfall (they pray, they pray)

This goes out to cats, fingers in they ass again
Fifty dollar half-a-men, daydreamin'
Fuck around get wet like semen, your whole team and
Be more gone than Freeman
I took the cream and, moved to new places, new faces
Fuck the screw faces, 'cause when I flip
I make the papers, dangerous, we Goodfellas
Niggas can't bang with us, try to do me
My crew be unruly (what)
Some old school cats that call gats toolies
Call blacks moolies, think it's cool to smoke woolies
And fuck without rubbers (what)
Specialize in killin' wives and grandmothers
Who ya trustin', shit
When Frank start bustin', Frank start somethin'
Killin' ya gently, God meant me, to push a Bentley
Me and Sean Combs takin' broads home
On the phone with the chip, with these Cristal chicks
'Bout to make our own porno flicks, my life's the shit

[Chorus: DMC]

Whinin' like girlies (stop whinin' you bitches)
We been around the world twice, all we got is mo' ice
And mo' nice, sacrifice your heart
Lexus with the automatic start (what)
Fifty shots'll tear your club apart
Eatin' shrimp À la carte, with some bitches from Brussels
Eatin' clams and mussels
Uhh, octopus, pretty face no waist
I just want the bush, so I can mack it
Give her a package to push, 'cause I work them hoes
Pendejos I show you how to play them hoes
Can you just visualize it?
Before I go to sleep I check the beds and the closet
So I can sleep safe, not too many keep a mil' in the briefcase
Infrareds help me sleep safe, but wait

[Chorus: DMC]
That's not all, MC's have the gall (they pray, they pray)
To pray and pray for my downfall (they pray)

(Just pull the plug!) People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol (C'mon!)
C'mon, do as I do, go ahead, get mad and do it!
(Just pull the plug!) People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol (C'mon!)
C'mon, do as I do, go ahead, get mad and do it!
(Just let it go!)

[Verse 1]
Hand me an eighth, beam me up and land me in space
I'ma sit on top of the world, and shit on Brandy and Mase
I'm more than ill, scarier than a white journalist
In a room with Lauryn Hill human horror film
But with a lot funnier plot and people'll feel me
'Cause I'ma still be The Mad Rapper whether I got money or not
As long as I'm on pills and I got plenty of pot
I'll be in a canoe paddling, making fun of your yacht
But I would like an award for the best rapper to get
One mic in The Source and a wardrobe I can afford
Otherwise I might just end up back strikin' at Ford
And you wonder what the fuck I need more Vicodin for?
Everybody's pissin' me off: even the No Limit Tank
Looks like a middle finger sideways flippin' me off
No shit, I'm a grave danger to my health
Why else would I kill you then jump in a grave and bury myself?

[Chorus]
(Just pull the plug!) People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol (C'mon!)
C'mon, do as I do, go ahead, get mad and do it!
(Just let it go!) People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol (C'mon!)
C'mon, do as I do, go ahead, get mad and do it!
(Just do it!)

[Verse 2]
I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, patrollin' corners
Lookin' for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beatin' James Todd Senior
Across the back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in a wild hood as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood that I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed, I kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that I failed ninth grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person, don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of death, as I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind; you and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge, and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not? Blow your brain out, I'm blowin' mine out
Fuck it, you only live once, you might as well die now

[Chorus]
(Just let it go!) People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol (C'mon!)
C'mon, do as I do, go ahead, get mad and do it!
(Just pull the plug!) People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol (C'mon!)
C'mon, do as I do, go ahead, get mad and do it!
(Just do it!)

[Verse 3]
My laser disc'll make you take a razor to your wrist
Make you satanistic, make you take the pistol to your face
And place the clip and cock it back
And let it go until your brains are rippin' out your skull
So bad to sew you back would be a waste of stitches
I'm not a role model, I don't wanna babysit kids
I got one little girl, and Hailie Jade is Shady's business
And Shady's just an alias I made to make you pissed off
Where the fuck were you when Gilbert's paid to make me dishwash?
I make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got
You made me get a bigger attitude than eighty Kim Scotts
And she almost got the same fate that Grady's bitch got
I knew that "Just the Two of Us" would make you hate me this much
And "Just the Two of Us," that ain't got shit to do with us
And our personal life, it's just words on a mic
So you can call me a punk, a pervert or a chauvinist pig
But the funny shit is that I still go with the bitch!

[Chorus]
(Just pull the plug!) People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol (C'mon!)
C'mon, do as I do, go ahead, get mad and do it!
(Just let it go!) People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol
C'mon, do as I do, go ahead, get mad and do it!
(Just do it!)

[Verse 1]
Waited on you for so long
Too many days since January
I'm still sitting here alone
We should've did this already
Said I got a email today
Kind of thought that you forgot about me
But I wanna hit you back to say
Just like you, I get lonely

[Chorus]
Baby, I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
Don't tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely
Take me to another place where I'll be
Face to face, just you and me with no rules
Just like you, I get lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely

[Verse 2]
Ready for us to get it on
Ain't got a love to call steady
Hope it ain't like that for long
I'll be your friend if you let me
Don't wanna come on strong
'Cause too many people wanna get me
But you know I do what I gotta do
Just like you, I get lonely

[Chorus]
Baby, I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
Don't tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely
Take me to another place where I'll be
Face to face, just you and me with no rules
Just like you, I get lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
I get lonely too
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
Baby, I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
Don't tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely
Take me to another place where I'll be
Face to face, just you and me with no rules
Just like you, I get lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely too
Ooh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Just like you, I get lonely

[Outro]
I get lonely
I get lonely
Just like you

[Intro]
Boi-1da... Drizzy

[Verse 1]
Y'all don't really like me
I can understand
My flow is sitting right inside the pocket on my pants
I'm still fly, you can't float
Run this shit, Usain Bolt
I write your favorite records, are you saying ghost?
Twenty-thousand for a verse is our routine quote
I'm getting rich, uhh, you staying broke
Chillin' even if I'm in a goose down coat
I can't see you through the Mosley Tribes
So I don't even flinch if you throw me high-fives
They try to measure up, but there is no one my size
Whatever 40's smokin' 'bout to low my eyes
Beast mode on them, I never take a night off
Every single thing a nigga purchase is a write off
Grounded as the runway pavement, I'm taking flight off
Baby go ahead and cut the light off
Cause it's about to go

[Verse 2]
I hear my phone ringing when you call
I ain't pickin' up or entertainin' them at all
Got your girl face down, bangin' on the wall
While you and all your homeboys hang in Lenox Mall
Mmm, mmm, mmm
I cannot relate
Ridin' with some tags that I got from out of state
Ridin' with a swag that I got from outer space
Just show me who's the hottest, I'mma knock him out his place
Call me homicide Drizzy, I'm 'bout to kill your ego
I'm about my green, puffin' goody like I'm Cee-lo
You can go and take a glance at your hero
While the Houston ship a pole dancing zero
Fantasy to you, reality to me
And yeah, my G-pass is as valid as can be
I'm so fresh, a stylist would agree
Waving at your girl while she's smiling back at me like

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Hey, do you have any black inside you?
Would you like some? (Would you like some?)
Ha, you know you got a right to do whatever you like to
Don C, we got the right one, that right one
In the club, always the flyest, always got her hands the highest
She stopped drinking Diet Coke, she on that coke diet
She bad, she bat her eyelids, that girl is so wired
I know she so tired, but ooh, she on fire!
Hundred dollar bills, look at you, look at you
A hundred dollar bills, this ain't new, this ain't new
From that Paris, Lindsay, Britney, Mary-Kate and Whitney
People say that they clean, motherfucker, don't bullshit me!

[Chorus: Shay Haley]
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom
All the girls standing in the (All the girls standing in the)
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
You left your nigga home, you said you at your sister's
You and your girlfriends wrong, you in here taking pictures
You ain't gotta tell us, you spending daddy's cash
Your girlfriend's jealous, you got the fattest ass
One dying to pee, one tryna leave
It's hot as fuck, but you just dying to ski
It's clear as black and white, like a fat panda
Your brain is Magic City, your nose is Atlanta
I said, "Think 'bout your future, you can't do that tomorrow"
But you don't hear a word, you see that SLR, uh
You like, "Hey, Pharrell, I ain't tryna kill your mood
But I can do the Star Trak sign—see? Killa dude"

[Chorus: Shay Haley & Kanye West]
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom (On fire)
All the girls standing in the (All the girls standing in the)
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Now she got high hopes, just to say hi to us
She want the high life, she like them higher-ups
She know we high-rolling, she know it's high-stakes
That's why she high speeding, out on that highway
She say she high-maintenance, she say she high-fashion
She say she high-priced, I think she high cappin'
She had her high-heels, I had my high-tops
Sipping a Hi-C, eating on Hydrox
I asked her, "How it feel up on this high-rise?"
She said, "This high score, this was the highlight"
She got her hiPod, bumpin' her hiTunes (Higher!)
This higher education, welcome to high school

[Chorus: Shay Haley, Kanye West & Pusha T]
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom (On fire)
All the girls standing in the (All the girls standing in the)
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom (Yuugh!)

[Verse 4: Pusha T]
Like I got a crown made of powder
Everybody knows who the king of the coke flow be
All I hear is "Oh, key," every line is "Oh, key"
All you rappers okey-dokey
Nigga, you don't paint pictures, I paint Murakamis on you niggas
And Daimer Speedy Bag, bitches
Buy and sell, I can accommodate your clientele
Shamu weight, motherfucker, brace your scales
P to the -usha
With a name like that, what you look for?
More or less like P with the hook-up
Hit me on the bat phone if you want it cooked up
Ride with me, as I'm switching lane to lane
In my Play Cloths as I'm grippin' grain
In a hail of bullets how I write my name
Whether soft or hard, motherfucker, 'caine is 'caine

[Chorus: Shay Haley & Kanye West]
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom
All the girls standing in the (All the girls standing in the)
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom (On fire)
All the girls standing in the (All the girls standing in the)
All the girls standing in the

[Verse]
They tryin' to censor the influencer
Just makes me sicker, influenza, yeah
I'll abide by the censorship
Soon as they ride I'll get back on my nigga shit
Can't reverse
The boy-game Advanced, complete the genesis
I've broke bread with societies menaces
I've dedicated sentences to the dead, and said hold your heads to my niggas doin’ sentences
I send condolences to the victims but, threats to the witnesses
On my path I was facing a paragraph, myself
So they sentiments is felt
When you hate your own and discriminate of self
In a cell gotta make your home, coz you might never make it home
Suicide on your side might commit it with your belt
Keep your pants on homie
Streets are damn so lonely, like only
A bunch of niggas won’t help, nah
That’s the enemy of stealth
Plus if they get caught how you gonna keep your heart fatigue
The hustler’s diet is the enemy of health, give you heart disease
Arteries hard but its hard to leave the bread alone
Aren’t we hard headed, headed for harm, but don’t fret it homes
From the twist tied to the butt
We be rippin’ it up
From the horror to the cure, don’t force the issue
To you my niggas in the war, may the force be with you

[Intro: The Notorious B.I.G. (Diddy)]
Uh, uh, (Uh, come on)

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G. (Diddy)]
Ha, sicker than your average, Poppa twist cabbage off instinct
Niggas don't think shit stink
Pink gators, my Detroit players
Timbs for my hooligans in Brooklyn (That's right)
Dead right, if the head right, Biggie there e'ry night
Poppa been smooth since days of Underoos
Never lose, never choose to, bruise crews who
Do somethin' to us, talk go through us (Come on, do it)
Girls walk to us, wanna do us, screw us
Who, us? Yeah, Poppa and Puff (He, he)
Close like Starsky and Hutch, stick the clutch
Dare I squeeze three at your cherry M-3 (Take that, take that, take that, ha ha!)
Bang every MC easily, busily
Recently niggas frontin', ain't sayin' nothin' (Nothin')
So I just speak my piece, keep my peace (Come on)
Cubans with the Jesus piece, with my peeps (Thank you)
Packin', askin', "Who want it?", you got it, nigga, flaunt it
That Brooklyn bullshit, we on it

[Chorus: Pamela Long]
Biggie, Biggie, Biggie, can't you see?
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your flashy ways
Guess that's why they broke, and you're so paid
Biggie, Biggie, Biggie, can't you see? (Uh-huh)
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me (Hypnotize)
And I just love your flashy ways (Uh-huh)

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I put hoes in NY onto DKNY (Uh-huh)
Miami, D.C. prefer Versace (That's right)
All Philly hoes go with Moschino (Come on)
Every cutie with a booty bought a Coogi
Now who's the real dookie? Meaning, who's really the shit?
Them niggas ride dicks, Frank White push the six
Or the Lexus, LX, four and a half
Bulletproof glass, tints if I want some ass
Gonna blast, squeeze first, ask questions last
That's how most of these so-called gangsters pass
At last, a nigga rappin' about blunts and broads
Tits and bras, ménage à trois, sex in expensive cars
I'll still leave you on the pavement
Condo paid for, no car payment (Uh-uh)
At my arraignment, note for the plaintiff
"Your daughter's tied up in a Brooklyn basement"
Face it, not guilty, that's how I stay filthy (Not Guilty)
Richer than Richie, 'til you niggas come and get me (Come on)

[Chorus: Pamela Long]
Biggie, Biggie, Biggie, can't you see?
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your flashy ways
Guess that's why they broke, and you're so paid

Sometimes your words just hypnotize me (Hypnotize)
And I just love your flashy ways (Uh-huh)
Guess that's why they broke, and you're so paid

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
I can fill you with real millionaire shit (I can fill ya)
Escargot, my car go one-sixty, swiftly (Come on)
Wreck it, buy a new one
Your crew run-run-run, your crew run-run
I know you sick of this, name brand nigga with
Flows, girls say he's sweet like licorice
So, get with this nigga, it's easy (Uh-huh)
Girlfriend, here's a pen, call me round ten
Come through, have sex on rugs that's Persian (That's right)
Come up to your job, hit you while you workin'
For certain, Poppa freakin', not speakin'
Leave that ass leakin', like rapper demo
Tell them ho take they clothes off slowly (Slowly)
Hit 'em with the force like Obi (Obi)
Dick black like Toby (Toby)
Watch me roam like Romey (Romey)
Lucky they don't owe me
Where the safe? Show me, homie (Say what, homie)

[Chorus: Pamela Long]
Biggie, Biggie, Biggie, can't you see?
Sometimes your words just hypnotize me

Part 1 - VCR

[Verse 1]
I don't want to play you
I just want to tape you undressing
And I'll lay you down and record soft porn
If it's romance then it's hardcore
If it's horror, pop the popcorn
The thoughts to rape you really turns me on

[Chorus]
Press my buttons baby
Just to press buttons
Press my buttons baby
Yeah
Press my buttons baby
Press my fucking buttons baby
Press my buttons baby
Bitch

[Verse 2]
You're my favorite show, any chance I get I try to watch
Die-hard fans can't stop with the tapings
Sort of like a psycho when I can't stop with the rapings
Of the VHS, especially during sex, baby

[Chorus]
Press my buttons baby
Press my fucking buttons baby
Press my buttons baby
Yeah
Press my buttons baby
Press my fucking buttons baby
Press my buttons baby
Bitch

[Verse 3]
Ready to watch? I'mma slip it in the tape deck
But put it in slow-mo, I don't want to bust the tape yet, press play
Now this is what I call an evening
A live show, almost equivalent to the screening
Your dream movie? I'm the clearest copy
Now time for Blow, I'm Johnny deep with the rarest poppy
Snort a little, now you're getting groovy
'Cause I'll kill you if I find out you're watching some other movies, bitch

[Chorus]
Press my buttons baby
Press my fucking buttons baby
Press my buttons baby
Bitch
Press my buttons baby
Press my fucking buttons baby
Press my buttons baby (O.F.)

[Verse 1]
Danielle, Danielle, yeah you heard about Raquel
Well that didn't go well, let us try to make it swell
Put the beaver in the mail, we can take it slow like snail
Lock my heart up, this is jail, throw away the key

[Chorus]
Can I sleep over
And wake up next to you? (I want you bad)
I want to feel you near
Just let me whisper in your ear
Um

[Verse 2]
We can kick it on the couch, blunt you can roll it up
But I'm on some shrooms if you really want to feel the room
I just want to kick it, kick it for the rest
I skated all day, I just need some rest and your breasts

[Chorus]
Can I sleep over
And wake up next to you?
I want to feel you near
Just let me whisper in your ear

Look into your eyes I realize that I like you so much
That was corny, now I'm horny, can I have a kiss? Kiss

[Chorus]
Can I sleep over
And wake up next to you? (Bitch)
I want to feel you near (Yeah, got you, bitch)
Just let me whisper in your ear
Um

We both teenagers with the same mind state
How about some ice cream and some South Park for this first date?
Your cat is waiting for that raw fish, I can't wait
Get it?

[Chorus]
Can I sleep over
And wake up next to you?
I want to feel you near
Just let me whisper in your ear

So I'm a raptor, tearin' it up like a tractor
Matter of fact, I'm killin' this track, you're a slacker
Sack like a sacker
Hello Mr. Brady

Baby, someone try to save me, lately
I've been hearing these things that sound crazy
Like....da- da- da

Speaking in tongues....alright
OK, stop, drop and roll Justin Bieber is on fire
It's time to realize it's time to call me young sire
You're the seller, I'm the buyer
You're the teller, and I'm higher
I'm higher than the highest point and, yes, I'm flyer
And I'm wired to the game
Stay dry when it rains
I'm tired of the fame, are you proud of the pain?
Yes, we're the same, yes I'm insane
And my mane hangs down, I'm a puppet got strings
I murdered that man, OK
Shawty Mane, Shawty Mane
What you doin' Shawty Mane?
Haha I'm Justin Bieber
You guys might know me, uh as the guy that sings Baby

On the rap game

Your lovely lady lumps, lumps, lumps

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I get her on top (Yeah), she drop it like it's hot (Yeah)
And when I'm at the bottom, she Hillary Rodham (Ha)
The middle of the bed (Yeah), giving, gettin' head (Yuh)
Givin', gettin' head (Huh), givin', gettin' head (Haha)
I said hmm, mmm (I like that)
Said hmm, mmm, mmm (Yeah, I like that)
I said hmm, mmm, mmm (Yeah, I like that)
Mm-hm

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
Say, call me, so I can come and do it for you
Call me, so I can come and prove it for you
Call me, so I can make it juicy for you
Call me, so I can get it juicy for you

[Refrain: Static Major, Lil Wayne, & Both]
Shawty wanna lick, lick, lick, lick, lick me like a lollipop (Haha!)
She— She lick me like a lollipop, l-lollipop
I said he's so sweet, make her wanna lick the wrapper
She-She-She lick me like a lollipop
(What you do?) So I let her lick the rapper
She— She lick me like a lollipop

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Yeah
Uh-huh

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, hardly home but always reppin'
You hardly on and always second
When I'm awake, you always restin'
And when they call you the answer, you are hardly questioned
I, I'm doin' classic shit in all my sessions
Other niggas' situations, they are all depressin'
That's why I never follow y'all suggestions
I just always did my own thing
Now I run the game, you stupid motha-suckas
I see all this money through my Ohio State Buckeyes
Shit been goin' good, but good can turn to better
'Cause you the type to lose her, and I'm about to get her

[Chorus: Drake]
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, best believe I understand
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, wrong way down a one-way
Women don't get saved 'round me, even on a Sunday
Damn, where I get it from? These niggas always wonder who
Then they meet my pop and tell him, "Drake is just a younger you"
And shawty wanna party, so don't let yo' girl up out the house
Or there'll be shots on TMZ of me givin' her mouth-to-mouth
Now she's famous and the paparazzi starts to shoot her
I drive two black cars, I named 'em Malcolm X and Martin Luther
I don't ever play, but I'm in the game lady
They just lose to love, those are tennis games, lady
Have you countin' money, goin' duffle bag crazy
Sippin' on Pink Floyd and puffin' Wayne Brady
Damn, whose line is it anyways?
I'm in a daze, you been amazed
Y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage
I'm on fire, yup, I've been ablaze
I got dough to blow, but I wanna blow it right, you look nice
And yo' frame makes me wanna bowl a strike, well alright
Guess I might, know what? Fuck it, yes I will
I am more than what you bargained for and nothin' less than real
Put it to your life

[Chorus: Drake]
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, best believe I understand
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on

[Verse 3: Bun B]
Bun B, king of the trill, also one of the dopest
Whether the streets or on the mic, I'm dope and yes I'm focused
The gangsta recognize me for my loc-ness, no joke, it's
Time to shake these haters off like the skin of a locust
Or maybe like a python, that's the type of shit I'm on
I wrote this on my iPhone, so let me drop this iBomb
I palm the game like it's a Spalding ball and take flight
From the free-throw line and slam it down like I'm the great Mike
Bun and Wayne and Drake in here, mane, this gon be a great night
Look at all these posers bite our swagger like a great white
Try to cross me over I just fake left, then I break right
Stupid animal tricks like David Letterman's Late Night
This that major moment you've been waitin' on for too long
The best that ever did it and doin' it on a new song
UGK and Young Money, too strong
Bound to be in the green like a crouton, so what the fuck is you on?

[Chorus: Drake]
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, best believe I understand
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
I am the leather jacket, black glasses, All-American bad boy
I own the swagger supermarket and you, you just a bag boy
'Cause I got that swag boy, the swag you never had boy
Hate and I will leave your chest the color of my flag, boy
Soowoo, bitch, I do this shit, I'll erase you like I drew you, bitch
And I keep that toaster, you can come and be my strudel, bitch
I'm so uptown
And motherfucker if you ain't, don't go uptown, yeah
And now I'm on that rock shit
But why they let me in? I'm just gon' shoot 'em in the mosh pit
Haha, fuck is you talkin' 'bout?
Weezy in ya mouth, now, Weezy what you talkin' 'bout?
Young Mula, baby

[Chorus: Drake]
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell your friends
That I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, I'm on, best believe I understand
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
It's okay, it's okay, you can run and tell my city
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm on, come on, you can run and tell my city it's on

[Chorus: Pusha T]
Doin' my thing, pocket full of green
Hand on my dick in my thousand-dollar jeans
Your girl a queen, my girl a thing
You know what, though? I'ma take, I'ma take this one for the team

[interlude: Kanye West]
Hehe
I'ma take this one for the team
G.O.O.D. Music!
Yeah, ugh

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
You know what? I figured out I'm not a nice guy
I shook hands, kissed babies, gave it a nice try
You know what? I hate pictures of other people kids
I hate plastic couches in other people cribs
I hate when other people cribs smell like shit
I hate when I leave and smell like the crib
What's the cause of the poor smell?
She said, "I just cleaned up", baby, I can't tell
Why every ghetto bitch gotta smell like Love Spell
Or that God damn cucumber Bath and Body Works?
I can still smell the sweat, the shit hardly works
What about Cool Water? That shit probably worse
This here a classic like the La-Di-Da-Di verse
And my man probably hollered at the hottie first
I scored, he took the charge
Oooh, that shit gotta hurt

[Chorus: Pusha T & Kanye West]
Doin' my thing (Hah), pocket full of green (Yeah)
Hand on my dick in my thousand-dollar jeans (Yeah)
Your girl a queen, my girl a thing (Ehh)
You know what, though? I'ma take, I'ma take this one for the team

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Never mind me, 'Ye, have fun
If the cops ask, that's my gun
That's my weed, anything you need
I'ma take, I'ma take, I'ma take this one for the team
One fat ass, one flat ass
Nigga hit the switcheroo on my black ass
Ever seen Joe's Jeans on a jackass?
And my bitch got on tights with a tack ass
I'm a fly nigga, and I carry on
With them bottles of that Rosé and Perignon
Ever seen how a kingpin carries on?
Dookie rope link chain and a herringbone
The real shit, gotta feel this
First class flights, baby, that's a field trip
Double date, don't cooperate, kill switch
Fuck me and my man, you a real bitch

[Chorus: Pusha T & Kanye West]
Doin' my thing, pocket full of green (Yeah)
Hand on my dick in my thousand-dollar jeans (Yeah)
Your girl a queen, my girl a thing (Yeah)
You know what, though?
I'ma take, I'ma take this one for the team

[Interlude: Kanye West]
Ladies and gentlemen
It's G.O.O.D. Music in the house
And we got... Keri!

[Bridge: Keri Hilson & Kanye West]
Boy, I know you the one that I heard about (Hah)
And I know you workin' with it through word of mouth
Looks like I'ma have to test you in and out
It's a dirty job but sometimes you gotta
Take it for the team (Hah)
Take it for the team
Take it for the team (I like your mentality, baby)
Take it for the team (Hahahahaha)

[Verse 3: Cyhi the Prynce]
(CyHi!) I'm blowin' on stinky that come in a jar
(CyHi!) Playin' with her kitty, made her come in the car
(CyHi!) She a redbone but her cousin is dark
(CyHi!) A little out of shape but she'll fuck in the dark
Until she start complainin' 'bout her feet hurt
I'm trying to fuck, she talkin' 'bout she want to eat first
I'm like, "Why did this bitch have to bring her?"
Tryin' to get her back to the nest so I could sting her
So I hit Big Sean on the ringer
I said, "I got a chick for you that look like a singer
On a scale of one to ten, she's a fifteen-er"
Man, you shoulda seen a nigga face when he seen her
He said the bitch wasn't pretty enough to finger
On my team, she would be a fifth-stringer
I said, "I got the fine one in the Bimmer
I'm the point guard and I need a wing, take it for the team"

[Bridge: Keri Hilson]
Take it for the team
Take it for the team
Take it for the team
Take it for the team

[Chorus: Pusha T & Kanye West]
Doin' my thing, pocket full of green
Hand on my dick in my thousand-dollar jeans
Your girl a queen, my girl a thing
You know what, though?
I'ma take, I'ma take this one for the team
I'ma take this one for the team
G.O.O.D. Fridays
I'ma take this one for the team

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
It's the nigga they love to hate
But all the bad model bitches they love to date
You need to check my swag and get up to date
Check, check my swag and get up to date
We in the bathroom now, she get her back blew out
She can't clean but I bet she got a vacuum mouth
And I bet I'm gon' sweat her Vidal Sassoon out
Her friend bust in, goddamn, who brought the raccoon out?
For the team, uh

[Break: Kanye West]
Like we always do at this time
Like, like we always do at this time
I go for, I got to
Like we always do at this time
Like we always do at this time
Go for, I got to
Like we always do at this time
Hah, like we always do at this time
Southside, we gon' set this party off right
This time
This time
Yeah, yeah
Mike Dean on the keys
Hey, oh

[Outro: Kanye West]
They love to hate
Bad model bitches, they love to date
They need to check my swag and get up to date
Check-check-check my swag and get up to date
Aye, it's the nigga they love to hate
But all the bad model bitches, they love to date
They need to check my swag and get up to date
Check-check-check my swag and get, uh, aye

[Intro]
Five, four, three, two, one, ah!

[Verse 1]
You were a child crawling on your knees toward it
Making mama so proud, but your voice is too loud
We like to watch you laughing
You pick the insects off plants, no time to think of consequences

[Chorus]
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted

[Verse 2]
The water is warm, but it's sending me shivers
A baby is born crying out for attention
The memories fade like looking through a fogged mirror
Decision to decisions are made and not bought
But I thought this wouldn't hurt a lot, I guess not

[Chorus]
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees wanted to be haunted
Control yourself, take only what you need from it
A family of trees

[Verse 1]
All along the Western front
People line up to receive
She got the power in her hand
To shock you like you won't believe
Saw her in the Amazon
With the voltage running through her skin
I was standing there with nothing on
She gonna teach me how to swim

[Chorus]
I said, "Ooh, girl!
Shock me like an electric eel
Baby girl
Turn me on with your electric feel"
I said, "Ooh, girl!
Shock me like an electric eel
Baby girl
Turn me on with your electric feel"

[Verse 2]
All along the Eastern shore
Put your circuits in the sea
This is what the world is for
Making electricity
You can feel it in your mind
Oh, you can do it all the time
Plug it in, change the world
You are my electric girl

[Chorus]
I said, "Ooh, girl!
Shock me like an electric eel
Baby girl
Turn me on with your electric feel"
I said, "Ooh, girl!
Shock me like an electric eel
Baby girl
Turn me on with your electric feel"

[Outro]
Do what you feel now!
Electric feel now
Do what you feel now!
Electric feel now
Do what you feel now!
Electric feel now
Do what you feel now!
Electric feel now
Do what you feel now!

[Lupe Fiasco]
Now if you never left Houston get a passport
Never left Little Haiti get a passport
If you live in South Central get a passport
So you can see the world
Yeah, and if you rep the five boroughs get a passport
Or if you're in the Dirty South get a passport
If you're on the Westside get a passport
So you can see the world

[Pharrell]
Now I've been known to levitate
Like a hobo tryna catch a freight
To get away, and clear the day
Then I'll be smilin' at the stars like the hood does cars
Little ghetto mind you should travel like a bullet
From your favorite gun's barrel or the Indian's arrow
Mathematically aligned like the pyramids or Pharaohs
Don't let 'em bring demise like you and your boys are cattle
Fly to Paris, and end up in Tokyo
Let's start a coalition so even the broke can go
To all those that never sold coke before
And with no ambitions to rock or roll
Let my, people go
To broaden their horizons
Sharpen all they minds in
Sharper than the prong or the Neptune's trident
I'm just ramblin' - I ride my bike in the clouds
Mr. Spielberg, hire me at Amblin
(To the nigga Pimp C) God bless your life
(And the creators of the syrup) I hope you're restin' right
Because you screwed a lot of lives, kids and wives
In my mind I'm goin' "woo-hoo" just like The Hives
But in my mind, compromise my design
Like a missin' puzzle piece, make completion hard to find
Hours resuscitated by Capri Sun juice packs
Woke up singin' N.E.R.D. songs and you can YouTube that
Now stay away from people that pursuit they lack
And remember your starter kit was this Lupe track
Now one love (one love) one love (one love)
Hey love, see you in Tokyo

[Q-Tip]
My new passport has been issued so I'm ready
Trekkin the Sahara or grazin the Serengeti
I am there if there's speakers in the place
I will see a foreign face
My magic carpet shuttles me through the human race
But, no matter what's on her mood to foreign district
My postcards so you I missed it
It bein us, how we would discuss findin treasures
Deep in choral reefs, Tigerbillies Islands of pleasure
Holdin you my pretty 'til I get home to our city
In this chitty-chitty bang-bang brutal to our bus
So I, take it in, the wonderments of the world
Samplin each cuisine, a dinner without a girl
Presents for my people like these silly t-shirts
While Rebecca's at the sound check hooked to Mic Works
I remember days when the dollar was strong
Hopefully it gets better, I won't be gone long - backpack

[Hook: Lupe Fiasco]
Let's go to sleep in Paris, wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans, fall in love in Chicago
Mayne, then we can land in the motherland
Camel back across the desert sands
Then take a train, to Rome, or home
Brazil, for real
Wherever I go she goes

[Sarah Green]
Yeah, I'd done seen Paris, and woke up in Tokyo
But I'mma always be Sarah Green from the Southside of Chicago
Just because you on Section 8 and he left
It don't mean a thing ("Girl I can't go nowhere")
Just come and take a flight with me
Baby girl it's a world to see! (girl go on wit all that)
I never thought the Seven Wonders of the World
Would be so wonderful (for real?)
You got your ghetto pass, now go and get your passport
And make your swagger international (I'll think about it)
If you can, catch a flight, you can go, in your mind
Your destiny, YOU DECIDE! Wherever I go, we go

[Lupe Fiasco]
Oversees, even over here I over seer
Like I'm tryna stop these slaves from gettin freer
From the truth I never veer see, so, faithfully I steer
As I ride through yo' city like Revere, revered
Now everybody gon' and put yo' hands in the air
All you haters with yo' hands in yo' ears - it's okay
Cause later, it will sneak up on you like it's Metal Gear
Put you in a chokehold and then unconsciously you'll cheer
Remain upper tier, ain't no cryin down here
Only shed is in the back, yard with the tools in it
My hood's in disrepair with no schools in it
All the food ain't got no fuel in it
So crude, that's why I'm duelin it
Some dude's thinkin what Rasulullah do in it
Not what they did then, but now what do you do with it?
I know you sick of all the rat-tat-tat-tat
Well this the soothin sounds from the backpack rat pack
Seein Sarah Green from the FNF crew
Two from the Child Rebel and the Q
When I be home I resist it like it's Ohms
I was there, now I'm gone; Shalom!
Yeah, and if you rep the Midwest get a passport
If you from Detroit get a passport
If you from Chi-Town get a passport
So you can see the world
Get that little black girl, a passport
Get that little black boy, a passport
If you ain't got one, get yourself a passport
So you can see the world, yeah!

[Verse 1]
No question, you ain't gotta A-S-K
I fly through, pocket full of J-F-Ks
I rise to, the occasion like toast
With totes on the waist
And I flood your watch flooded like a basement man
You and my main foes fold like clean clothes
Sub-machine holes the size of Shaq rings in between your eyes like nose
Pinky mac ring like the song that Peedi Crack sings, I Propose
Don't make me stand up, told you
You ain't gotta have your hands up
I was like, screw paper
Then I ran round touched money, changed my mind
Mind on my change so I tucked money hands down
Now, in addition to the semi
There's paper on the waist like Henry
And niggas ain't seeing what I'm keeping concealed
They wanna be it, chill; you would leak it if the secret's revealed
Peep it, might leak it to polices and squeal
Then you gotta hide money like
Fresh or witness protect
Went from, best to business exec in less than 4!
You can get it in the chest like Fresh
Anything not next to Tec is hidden in the floor
So act like you Denzel or Rudy Ray Moore
Wait, there's more:
Let me catch you tappin' my floor like Savion or Morse
Hope you like the sound of hollow, I got more
I black out like DOS, how you gonna back out
There's no back doors, like Porsche
Or course, it's the Boss, Tony Danza of Stanza
Springsteen of sixteens
It's nothin' sweet, it's Lupe
I am White people's Kool-Aid, it's mean
The baller with the goggles like Kareem
From Chicago with the models on the scene
Duck fellas
Better get down like duck feathers
A rhyme or a crushed pepper
A grinder yeah that's much better
You a, dice game I'm a casino man
Hustler for life, you hear the lingo and
Find me covered in ice like Encino Man
Only one missin' is Pacino, man
Get it, ha ha

[Verse 1: Eminem]
There's not much you could do or say to phase me
People think I'm a little bit crazy
I get it from all angles, even occasionally Doc Dre-zie
Will have to step in every once in a while to save me
To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things
Sometimes I forget what other people just may think
A lot of rappers probably wouldn't know how to take me
If they heard some shit, I'd lay the tape 'fore they erased me
I may be a little too fast-paced and racy
Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me
Twenty times 'cause I say so many rhymes it may seem
Like I'm goin' too fast 'cause my mind is racing
And I could give a fuck what category you place me
Long as when I'm pushing up daisies
And gone as long as you place me amongst one of them greats
When I hit the heavenly gates I'll be cool beside Jay-Z
For every single die-hard fan who embraced me
I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me
And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me
Believe it or not, I thank my mom for how she raised me
In the neighborhood daily that jumped and chased me
It only made me what I am today, see
Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
You ain't gonna make or break me
Tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake, G
You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening
'Cause sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me
And when you face me with all the shit you've been saving
To say to me, you had all this time to think about it
Now don't pussy out and try to about face me
'Cause I've been patiently waiting for the day
That we finally meet in the same place to see

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I eat up
Oh, it's never enough
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I eat up
Oh oh, it's never enough

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
My flow's untouchable, now you gotta face it
Uh oh, it gets worse when I go back to the basics
You gon' say the wrong shit and get your whole face split
The smell of victory, love it so much I can taste it
I spot my target, blaze it, direct hit
Graze it, your peace talk, save it
Your shit sounds dated, you're overrated
I'm obligated to study your moves then crush you motherfuckers
If I'm the best and the worst, then God's gift is a curse
Soldier trained to destroy – you payin' attention, boy?
I spit shit, slick shit, so quick you miss it
To be specific I go ballistic as hieroglyphic
My music is a drug, press play, you ain't gotta sniff it
Shoot it or pop it, roll it, bag it or chop it
It'll get you high over and over, but you gotta cop it
When it's hot, it's hot, your hatin' is undeniable, stop it

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I eat up
Oh, it's never enough
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I eat up
Oh oh, it's never enough

[Hook: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever mayne
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever mayne

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Shit, nigga, this what I does
I swear I ain't lyin' like this is my cubs
This is my tub and I'm dirtier than the summer, bitch
Weezy F. Baby, always lookin' like I done some shit
You ain't on nothin' bitch, better know who you fuckin' with
Try to fuck me, I'll kill you and who you comin' with
No homo, T, I had to go stupid
I'm on them high heels and I am no Bootsy
Collins Avenue, ridin' with the Phantom roof gone
Or the Maybach two-tone, and my rims are too grown
That mean they 24's boy, what are you on?
I'm richer than a bitch without the grey poupon
Yeah, I'm talkin' out of my head
I make a blue-eyed bitch just admire my red
I'm a blood muthafucka, a blood muthafucka
Forever like E-T-C, period muthafucka

[Hook: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever mayne
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever mayne

[Verse 2: Drake]
I'm so unsigned, it would blow ones mind
Cause to every single record, I am so unkind
There are no holds barred, there is no love lost
Nigga, this that crack and you know drugs cost
So P-A-Y-U-P
I don't think you'll ever find another nigga like me
Never L-I-E, I got everything I tell 'em I got
This young nigga showboat like I'm sellin' a yacht
Ya heard me?
Who else tryna smoke? Yeah, nigga, me too
Cause take my mind off the preasure is what weed do
Your girl wetter than the bottom of a ski-doo
And take a bitch from any nigga is what we do
So bite down ho, or get the right dentist
I told Wayne I'm goin' in like a life sentence
And understand I send shots at who it's meant for
Never had a mentor, copy that: 10-4

[Hook: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever mayne
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever mayne

[Verse 3: Kidd Kidd]
Put on my OJ gloves and go and kill this shit
Make a plumber throw his plunger like, "I can't deal with this shit"
They say I'm throwed off, I stay on pitch
The flow ain't formal, I don't slack on shit
Bitch I'm back on my shit like a fly
Since you wan' be fly, throw you off the roof, fly
Like Pookie, take a dookie on the rapper loose leaf
And throw his trash ass through the window like Mookie
To a shark you just sushi
You ain't hard, you're coochie, Wally Oochie
Soft as newborn booty
Said I'm movin' slow, I'm just thinkin' fast
Look back, I ain't behind you, I'm 'bout to lap your ass
And nigga I don't rest, I'm up 'til my time's up
I been a tec chef, all my beef prime cut
This ain't punch lines, nigga your punch is lyin'
Cause the only punch you ever gave was Hawaiian

[Hook: Drake]
It may not mean nothin' to y'all
But understand nothin' was done for me
So I don't plan on stoppin' at all
I want this shit forever mayne
I'm shuttin' shit down in the mall
And tellin' every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even plannin' to call
I want this shit forever mayne

[Verse 1]
You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down

[Verse 2]
I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation
I break down

[Verse 3]
Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any jobber got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go
But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Nowhere to go

[Instrumental break 1:49-2:29]

[Verse 4]
One sweet dream
Pick up the bags, get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true today
Came true today
Came true today
Yes, it did

[Outro]
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
All good children go to Heaven
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
All good children go to Heaven
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
All good children go to Heaven
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
All good children go to Heaven
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
All good children go to Heaven
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
All good children go to Heaven
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
All good children go to Heaven
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
All good children go to Heaven
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
All good children go to Heaven

[Verse 1]
When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, "Let it be"
And in my hour of darkness, she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, "Let it be"

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

[Verse 2]
And when the brokenhearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Yeah, there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

[Verse 3]
And when the night is cloudy, there is still a light that shines on me
Shine on 'til tomorrow, let it be
I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, "Let it be"

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Oh, there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Oh, there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

[Intro: The Notorious B.I.G. & P. Diddy]
Uh, I like that, you like that?
Here's another one, and another one
And another one, and another one
Uh
Whaat, whaat (c'mon)

[Chorus: R Kelly & The Notorious B.I.G.]
You must be used to me spending (uh, uh)
And all that sweet wining and dining
Well, I'm fucking you tonight
Uh, here's another one
And another one
Uh, uh, what

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Some say the X, make the sex spec-tacular
Make me lick you from yo' neck to your back, then ya
Shivering, tongue delivering
Chills up that spine, that ass is mine
Skip the wine and the candlelight, no Cristal tonight
If it's all right with you, we fucking (that's cool)
Déjà vu, the blunts sparked, finger fucking in the park
Pissy off Bacardi Dark
Remember when I used to play between your legs?
You begged for me to stop because you know where it would head
Straight to your mother's bed
Not the Marriott, we'd be lucky if we find a spot
Next to your sister, damn I really missed the
Way she used to rub my back, when I hit that
Way she used to giggle when your ass would wiggle
Now I know you're used to suites at the Parker Meridien
Trips to the Caribbean, but tonight, no ends

[Chorus: R Kelly & The Notorious B.I.G.]
You must be (uh) used to me spending
You must be used to me (uh)
And all that sweet wining and dining (what)
Well, I'm fucking you tonight

And another one (no doubt baby)
And another one (fucking you)
What! What! Uh
You must be used to me spending
You must be! (uh, uh)
And all that sweet wining and dining
Well, I'm fucking you tonight
Here's another one (fucking you)
And another one (no doubt about it baby, fucking you)
Uh, uh

[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Girl you look fine
Like a wide face Rolex, you just shine
I like that waistline
Let me hit that from behind, which wall you wanna climb
My style genuine, girl I love you long time
I got you pinned up, with your fucking limbs up
All because you like the way my Benz was rimmed up
Bitch keep yo' chin up, please watch me do thee
Nasty, like it when you make it move fast mami
I like it when you tro' it pon me
No love making, strictly back breaking
Cease know, all his hoes, go to my door
Then they go to his flo', to fuck some more
So no, caviar, Shark Bar, uh-uh
Strictly sex that's sweaty and leftover spaghetti
I know you used to slow CD's and Dom P's
But tonight it's eight tracks and six-packs while I hit that

[Chorus: R. Kelly & P. Diddy]
You must be used to me spending
(You must be, used to me)
And all that sweet wining and dining (spending all his money baby, on you)
Well, I'm fucking you tonight
Can you feel me?, 'cause I can feel you
Can you feel me?, 'cause I can feel you
You must be used to me spending
You must be used to me
And all that sweet wining and dining
Well, I'm fucking you tonight
(fucking you tonight)
Can you feel me? (make ya feel so right),'cause I can feel you (baby come to me)
Can you feel me (give me what I need), R. Kelly take me to the bridge

[Bridge: R. Kelly]
Let's stop the bullshit, baby
Let me take you to the spot, get you hot
So you wanna be with me (say what), Puff Daddy (that's right)
B.I.G. (let's go), bring that ass to me

[Chorus: R. Kelly & P. Diddy]
You must be used to me spending
And all that sweet wining and dining
Well, I'm fucking you tonight
(Said I'm fucking you tonight)
Can you feel me? (Fucking you tonight) 'cause I can feel you (stroking you tonight)
Can you feel me? 'Cause I can feel you
You must be used to me spending
(You must be used to me spending)
And all that sweet wining and dining
Well, I'm fucking you tonight
Fucking you baby, I'm fucking you baby
(You must be!!) You must be used to me spending
Can you feel me? 'Cause I can feel you
And all that sweet wining and dining
Well, I'm fucking you tonight (I'm doing it baby, I'm doing it baby, I'm doing it baby ah yeah, ooh, ooooh)
You must be used to me spending
(You must be babe, used to me)
And all that sweet wining and dining (spending money all of the time, on you)
Well, I'm fucking you tonight
No matter what you may say, babe
Giving it to you, any way I possibly can
You must be used to me spending
And all that sweet wining and dining
Well, I'm fucking you tonight, oohhh baby, sugar, honey

Shorty got swag, but her swag don't touch me
Underarm kush dogg, don't it smell musty?

When bitches come through, I tell em bring their girl too
It's swallow dick/truth, drink it like Grey Goose

But it feels so good when I'm getting brain!

Geeked up in the club, baby, we so high!

[Gucci Mane]

Call it G.B.D. chores, getting brain while I drive
Stellar Chevy rims on some skinny-ass tires

[Verse 1]
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

[Verse 2]
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free

[Chorus]
Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

[Outro]
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

[Intro: Labi Siffre]
Find your dreams come true
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
And I wonder

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Labi Siffre]
I've been waiting on this my whole life (And I wonder)
These dreams be waking me up at night (And I wonder)
You say I think I'm never wrong (And I wonder)
You know what? Maybe you're right, aight?

[Chorus: Labi Siffre]
And I wonder if you know
What it means what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
And I wonder

[Verse 2: Kanye West & Labi Siffre]
You say he get on your fucking nerves (And I wonder)
You hope that he get what he deserves—word! (And I wonder)
Do you even remember what the issue is?
You just trying to find where the tissue is
You can still be who you wish you is
It ain't happen yet, and that's what intuition is (And I wonder)
When you hop back in the car
Drive back to the crib, run back to they arms
The smokescreens, the chokes and the screams
You ever wonder what it all really means?

[Chorus: Labi Siffre]
And I wonder if you know
What it means, what it means
And I wonder if you know
What it means to find your dreams
And I wonder

[Verse 3: Kanye West & Labi Siffre]
And I'm back on my grind
A psychic read my lifeline, told me in my lifetime
My name would help light up the Chicago skyline
And that's why I'm (And I wonder)
Seven o'clock, that's primetime
Heaven'll watch, God calling from the hotlines
Why he keep giving me hot lines?
I'm a star, how could I not shine? (And I wonder)
How many ladies in the house? (If you know)
How many ladies in the house without a spouse? (What it means)
Something in your blouse got me feeling so aroused (What it means)
What you about? (And I wonder)
On that independent shit (If you know)
Trade it all for a husband and some kids (What it means)
You ever wonder what it all really mean?
You wonder if you'll ever find your dreams?
(To find your dreams come true)

[Chorus]
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle (Right)
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle (Right)

[Verse 1]
I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like you's the user
Sellin' drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way, mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray, so you can reminisce
And wish you wasn't livin' so devilish, shit
I remember I was just like you
Smokin' blunts with my crew, flippin' over 62's
'Cause G-E-D wasn't B-I-G
I got P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out nicks went for 20s down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock 19 for casket and flower moves
For chumps tryin' to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment, he wasn't tryin' to hear it
Smokin' mad Newports 'cause I'm due in court
For an assault that I caught in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand, 'cause man

[Chorus]
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle (Right)
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle (Right)

[Verse 2]
I had the master plan, I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland
With my man Two-TECs to take over this projects
They call him Two-TECs, he tote two TECs
And when he start to bust, he like to ask, "Who's next?"
I got my honey on the Amtrak with the crack
In the crack of her ass, two pounds of hash in the stash
I wait for hon to make some quick cash
I told her she could be lieutenant, bitch got gassed
At last, I'm literally loungin', black
Sittin' back, countin' double digit thousand stacks
Had to re-up, see what's up with my peeps
Toyota deal-athon had it cheap on the Jeeps
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead, with six to the head
Then I got the phone call, it couldn't hit me harder
We got infiltrated, like Nino at the Carter
Heard TEC got murdered in a town I never heard of
By some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners
And my bitch swear to God she won't snitch
I told her when she hit the bricks I'll make the hooker rich
Conspiracy, she'll be home in three
Until then I looks out for the whole family
A true G, that's me, blowin' like a bubble
In the everyday struggle

[Chorus]
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle (Right)
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle (Right)

[Verse 3]
I'm seein' body after body and our mayor Giuliani
Ain't tryin' to see no black man turn to John Gotti
My daughter use a potty so she's older now
Educated street knowledge, I'ma mold her now
Trick a little dough buyin' young girls fringes
Dealin' with the dope fiend binges, seein' syringes
In the veins, hard to explain how I maintain
The crack smoke make my brain feel so strange
Breakin' days on the set, no sweat
Drunk off Moët, can't bag yet because it's still wet
But when that dry, baggin' five at a time
I can clock about nine on the check cashin' line
I had the first and the third, rehearse, that's my word
Thick in the game, D's knew my first name
Should I quit? Shit no, even though they had me scared
Yo, they got a eight, I got a TEC with air holes

[Interlude: The Notorious B.I.G. & Puff Daddy]
And that's just how the shit go in the struggle, motherfucker
Hah, come on, what you say?

[Chorus]
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle (Right)
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle (Right)
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle (Right)
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle (Right)

[Outro: The Notorious B.I.G. & Puff Daddy]
Junior M.A.F.I.A. right
Yeah, rock on, woo!
Biggie Smalls, right
Junior M.A.F.I.A

[Verse 1]
Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

[Verse 2]
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

[Verse 3]
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly, someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Martha, my dear
Though I spend my days in conversation
Please, remember me
Martha, my love
Don't forget me
Martha, my dear

[Bridge 1]
Hold your head up, you silly girl
Look what you've done
When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you
Silly girl

[Bridge 2]
Take a good look around you
Take a good look, you're bound to see
That you and me were meant to be for each other
Silly girl

[Instrumental break]

[Bridge 1]
Hold your hand out, you silly girl
See what you've done
When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you
Silly girl

[Verse 2]
Martha, my dear
You have always been my inspiration
Please, be good to me
Martha, my love
Don't forget me
Martha, my dear

[Verse 1]
Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all her words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you

[Verse 2]
She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

[Bridge]
And in her eyes, you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

[Verse 3]
You want her, you need her
And yet you don't believe her when she says her love is dead
You think she needs you

[French Horn Solo: Alan Civil]

[Bridge]
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

[Verse 4]
You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone
But now he's gone, she doesn't need him

[Verse 5]
Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be times when all the things she said will fill your head
You won't forget her

[Bridge]
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

[Intro: Paul McCartney, John Lennon & George Harrison]
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Ah, look at all the lonely people!

[Verse 1: Paul McCartney]
Eleanor Rigby
Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?

[Chorus: Paul McCartney]
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

[Bridge: Paul McCartney, John Lennon & George Harrison]
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Ah, look at all the lonely people!

[Verse 3: Paul McCartney]
Eleanor Rigby
Died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie
Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

[Outro: Paul McCartney]
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people!)
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people!)
Where do they all belong?

[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Yo what's Crip-a-lat'n, this big Snoop Dogg
Leave your name and your number at the motherfucking beep
If this one of my hoes, two-way me

[Dr. Dre]
Ay ay Snoop whattup, this your nigga Dre
Ay man I was thinking I ain't said shit on your whole motherfucking album
So check it out, put this on there:
All you motherfucking haters out there, can suck my motherfucking dick!
And we still smoking, what?!

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
For the nigga who be talking loud and holding his dick, talking shit
He better lay low
For the bitch that said I shot some shit up out of my dick, now she sick
She better lay low
For the niggas who be claiming my hood
And really ain't from my gang, better lay low
I hope he don't be thinking I'm just talking
And I won't do a thing, really hope so

[Snoop Dogg]
Lay low, nobody move until I say so
Limo tint rolling deep like the President
See I don't go to clubs, I never chase a bitch
I'm here to bang that gangsta shit till the apocalypse
We call it stress, some of y'all call it chocolate
Return of the Top Dogg, and ain't no stopping this
Whatever the case, I ain't trying to catch it
Lay low, blow big dope, and slang records
Unseen but well heard, do not disturb
The only reason you alive cause I ain't sent the word
I flip, faster than birds, Snoop Dogg will emerge
From the smoke and go loc, you shouldn't provoke
I bring the worst from the L.B.C
Smash motherfuckers thinking they gonna smash on me
Snoop and Dre give a fuck about what y'all say
From the World's Most Dangerous Group, N.W.A

[Butch Cassidy]
Our rise, it was no surprise
I always knew these fools would trip
Hating, faking, scheming on mine
And on the down low talkin shit
Best move cause I refuse to lose
No matter which damn road I choose
So lay low cause you might be bruised
Top story on the evening news
I ain't for games, so if you wanna play 'em lay low
Lay down on the floor
I'm in a rage, so if we gotta do this let me know
That's what I came fo'

[Goldie Loc]
Where that nigga who be talking shit
He don't come around no more because I fucked his bitch
I made her suck my dick, while I was squeezing the tits
Then I hit it from the back, gripped tight on them hips
She tried to make me cum, but I was trying to take her home
Dropped her off and seen you fishing on your raggedy Brougham
Coulda thumped you in your dome (you little fag)
And don't sag too hard, you show everybody your thong

[Tray Deee]
Booyaka booyaka, we bring it straight to ya
From 22's to Luger's the shit that shoot through ya
Who you motherfuckers think the Top Dogg bang with
The same clique he came with and made the game flip
Now niggas grow they hair, hold they stare and act hard
That's even tho' your CEO talk shit get slapped hard
The backyard is where we get our scrap on
The black car drive by then you get capped on

[Master P]
Whassup pimping, it's P and Snoop
With Dre on the beat, this ain't nothing but loot
They call me Jed Clampett for all the bread I got
But they call me Bill Clinton for all the head I got
I keeps it realer, cause I'm all about my scrilla
The ladies love me cause I'm a million dolla hitta
It's, No Limit til I D-I-E
C-P-3, or Richmond, Cali's where I be

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
For the nigga who be talking loud and holding his dick, talking shit
He better lay low
For the bitch that said I shot some shit up out of my dick, now she sick
She better lay low
For the niggas who be claiming my hood
And really ain't from my gang, better lay low
I hope he don't be thinking I'm just talking
And I won't do a thing, really hope so

[Verse 1]
Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man, no time to talk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born

[Pre-Chorus]
And now it's all right, it's okay
And you may look the other way
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

[Chorus]
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive
Oh, when you walk

[Verse 2]
Well now, I get low and I get high
And if I can't get either, I really try
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes
I'm a dancing man, and I just can't lose

[Pre-Chorus]
You know it's alright, it's okay
I'll live to see another day
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

[Chorus]
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive

[Bridge]
Life's goin' nowhere, somebody help me
Somebody help me, yeah
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me, yeah
I'm stayin' alive

[Verse 1]
Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man: no time to talk
Music loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I was born

[Pre-Chorus]
And now it's all right, it's okay
And you may look the other way
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

[Chorus]
Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin'
And we're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive

[Outro]
Life's goin' nowhere, somebody help me
Somebody help me, yeah
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me, yeah
I'm stayin' alive
Life's goin' nowhere, somebody help me
Somebody help me, yeah
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me, yeah
I'm stayin' alive
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me
Somebody help me, yeah
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me, yeah
I'm stayin' alive
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me
Somebody help me, yeah
Life goin' nowhere, somebody help me, yeah
I'm stayin' alive

[Intro: Q-Tip]
Heh heh heh
Uh uh uh uh uh uh-ah
Uh eh eh uh (Woo!)
(Aah) Ooh (Oh) ee (Ah) ah (Eh) ooh (Eh, eh)

[Verse 1]

[Q-Tip]
One-two, one-two, keep it on
Listen to the shit because we keep it 'til dawn
Listen to the Abstract, got it going on
Listen to the ladies, come on and let me spawn
On your eggs, then you go up the river
Listen to the Abstract, that freaky nigga

[Ad Rock]
Now I'm Ad Rock and I shock and I tick and I tock
And I can't stop with the body rock

[Mike D]
See, I've got heart like John Starks
Hitting mad sparks
Pass me the mic and I'll be rockin' the whole park

[MCA]
Well, I'm the M to the C to the A and it's a must
The rhymes that we bust on the topic of lust

[Q-Tip]
And my Moms is not butt, but fuck it
Let me get down to the rhythm
Yes, I get funky and I'm shooting all my jism
Like John Holmes, the X-rated nigga
Listen to the shit cause I am the ill figure
Nobody's getting any bigger than this

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
Get it together
Get-get it together
Get...
Phone is ringing, oh my God
Get it together, see what's happening

[Verse 2]

[Q-Tip]
Ad Rock's down with the Ione
Listen to the shit cause both of them is bony
Gotta do it like this, like Chachi and Joanie

[Ad Rock]
'Cause she's the cheese and I'm the macaroni
So why all the fight and why all the fuss?
'Cause ha, I ain't got no dust
Yeah, you know I'm getting silly
Got a Grandma Hazel and a Grandma Tilly

[Mike D]
Well, I'm the Grand Royal prez and I'm also a member
Born on the cusp in the month of November
I do the Patty Duke, in case you don't remember
Well, I freak a funky beat like the shit was in a blender

[MCA]
Well, I'm long gone, word is bond
Don't need a motherfuckin' fool to tell me right from wrong
I don't think I'm slick nor do I play like I'm hard
But I'ma drive the lane like I was Evan Bernard

[Ad Rock]
And I be working on my game

[Mike D]
Because life is taxing

[MCA]
Gotta get it together

[All 3]
And see what's happening

[Chorus: Q-Tip]
Get it together
Wait a minute, wait a minute (Get)
Wait a minute, (Get it) wait a minute
Get it together
Wait a minute, (Get) wait a minute (Get-get)
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Get it together
Wait a minute, wait a minute
S-see what's happening

[Verse 3]

[Q-Tip]
I go One-Two like my name was Biz Mark
But I had to do the shit, just let me embark
On the lyric and the noun and the verb
Let me kick the shit off cause, yo, I'm not the herb

[Mike D]
Well, it's not the herb but the spice with the flavor to spare
The Moog with the funk for your derriere
While we're on that topic, yes, I like to mention
When it comes to bonin' - woo! - I'm representing

[MCA]
Spacin', zonin', talkin' on the phone and
My brain is roamin' and I don't know where it's goin'
Talking lots of shit, a little tweaking on the weekend (what?)
I gotta to get him by the reins because I know that I'm freaking (yeah)

[Ad Rock]
Well, I'm a funky soul and I'm a Scorpio
And when I get my flow I'm Dr. On-the-Go
So, Q-Tip, what you on the mic for?

[Q-Tip]
Because I had to talk about the times when I rhyme
And when the MC's come in my face, I'm like mace
Because I back them off with the quills
'Cause I have to tell you, nigga, 'cause I'll keep you under prills
Resting on Nine-One-One Sixteenth Ave., off the Farmers Boulevard (yeah)

[Ad-Rock]
Well I'm from Manhattan, MCA's from Brooklyn
Yeah, MCA, your shit be cookin'

[MCA]
(Yeah)
Praying mantis on the court and I can't be beat
But, yo, Tip, what's up with the boots on your feet?

[Q-Tip]
Got the Timbos on the toes and this is how it goes
Oh, one-two, oh my god
One-two, oh my god

[Mike D]
I got some shit
I've got the kung fu grip behind my green trap kit
Never, ever, ever smoking crack

[Q-Tip]
Never, ever, ever fucking wack
I eat the fuckin' pineapple Now & Laters
Listen to me now, don't listen to me later
Fuck it, 'cause I know I didn't make it fuckin' rhyme for real
But, yo, technically I'm as hard as steel

[Outro]
Gonna get it together, watch it
Gonna get it together, Ma Bell
I'm like Ma Bell, I got the ill communication
Ma Bell, Got the ill communication
Ma Bell, Got the ill communications (Who's that?)
Ma Bell, Got the ill communication (word 'em up, word-word 'em up)
Ma Bell
Eh-eh
Ah-ah-ha-ha
Keep it on and on

[Verse 1]
Single book of matches, gonna burn what's standing in the way
Roaring down the mountain, now they're calling on the fire brigade
Bury all the pictures, and tell the kids that I'm okay
If I'm forgotten, they'll remember me for today

[Chorus]
I, I won't ever be your cornerstone
I, I don't wanna be here holding on

[Verse 2]
All the black inside of me, is slowly seeping from the bone
Everything I cherish, is slowly dying or it's gone
Little shaken babies and drunkards seem to all agree
Once the show gets started it's bound to be a sight to see

[Chorus]
I, I won't ever be your cornerstone
I, I don't wanna be here holding on
I, I won't ever be your cornerstone
I

[Bridge]
Watch her roll, can you feel it?
Watch her roll, can you feel it?
Watch her roll, can you feel it?
Watch her roll, can you feel it?

[Outro]
I, I won't ever be your cornerstone
I, I don't wanna be here holding on (Watch her roll)
I (Can you feel it?)
I won't ever be your cornerstone
I (Watch her roll)

[Hook: Lady Gaga & Lil Wayne]
Oh, oh-oh, oh

P-P-P-Poker face, p-p-poker face

P-P-P-Poker face, p-p-poker face
Ahem

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
Um, she say— say can fuck me right
I made her fuck her friend
She said, "Don’t call her a dyke"
But that's gay, ha!

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I met her on Monday and fucked her all week
'Cause every time she leave, she come back to the tree
She know I love brain so I treat her like a geek
She love the way I spit, so I made the pussy gleek
Wild'n' with my niggas, and I don’t give a fuck
So I circle the bitches, we rounding 'em up
I treat her like I need her, I'm knowing if I eat her
She gon' tell Quita, and Quita like the media
"Woopty-woop" to the Bloods
Her lipstick match my flag—that's swag
Weezy F. Baby got nuts that drag
I put 'em in your mouth 'til you choke and gag

[Hook: Lady Gaga, Lil Wayne, & Jae Millz]
Oh, oh-oh, oh (Hahaha)
Oh, oh-oh, oh
P-P-P-Poker face (I poke her face off, and now, she faceless)
P-P-Poker face (I poke her so much, I deserve a bracelet)
Oh, oh-oh, oh (Ahhhhh!)
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh (Haha! Young Money!)
P-P-P-Poker face (I poke— I poke her face off, and now, she faceless)
P-P-Poker face (And I just gave "Poke Her Face" a facelift)
Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh

[Verse 2: Jae Millz]
Chi-Town girl (What?), bag match her heels
Her ass hella fake, but it feel real (Ha!)
And it felt great when we had sex
I tore her out the frame, like pics of my ex
From my aspect, I love your assets (Ha)
I love your mini-skirt (Why?) It's easy access
Pipe game never mediocre
So that relationship is over once I poke her
She said she wanted a tour of the tour bus ("So what you do?")
So I gave her a tour of the tour bus ("Who was there?")
It was all us on the tour bus (Ha!)
And she did all us ("Where?") On the tour bus, like...

[Hook: Lady Gaga & Jae Millz]
Oh, oh-oh, oh (Hahaha)
Oh, oh-oh, oh (Ha! Le' go!)
P-P-P-Poker face
P-P-P-Poker face (Um, I make her say...)
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
P-P-P-Poker face
P-P-P-Poker face

[Outro: Lady Gaga]
P-P-P-Poker face
P-P-Poker face
P-P-P-Poker face

[Intro: Eminem & Obie Trice]
Obie, yo
I'm sick
Damn, you straight, dog?

[Chorus: Eminem & Obie Trice]
That's why I ain't got no time (I think I got chlamydia)
For these games and stupid tricks
Or these bitches (Bitch!) on my dick
That's how dudes be gettin' sick (That bitch!)
That's how dicks be gettin' drips
Fallin' victims to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fuckin' chickens with no ribs
That's why I ain't got no time

[Verse 1: Obie]
Yo, I woke up, fucked up off the liquor I drunk (Damn!)
I had a bag of the skunk, won in last night's tunk
Pussy residue was on my penis, Denise from the cleaner's
Fucked me good, you shoulda seen this
Big booty bitch, switch unbearable (Shit!)
French roll stylin', body like a stallion
Sizin' up the figure, while my shit gettin' bigger
Debatin' on a fuck or do I wanna be her nigga?
Caressin' this bitch, plus I'm checkin' out them tits (Damn!)
Sippin' on that fine shit, I ain't used to buyin'
I gotta hit it from behind, it's mandatory
Like takin' hoes' money, but that's another story
For surely pussy on toast, after we toast
Her clothes fell like Bishop in Juice (C'mere)
The womb beater, clean pussy eater, insertin' my jock
In that spot hotter than the hottest block
"Don't stop!"—response I got when I was knockin' it
Clock's steady tickin', kinky finger-lickin'
And can on, semen's at my tip when she moans
I gotta slow down before I cum soon
And work that nigga like a slave owner (Yeah)
When I dropped off my outfit, she knew I wanted to bone her
She foamin' at them lips, the ones between the hips
Pubic hair's lookin' like some sour cream dip
Without the nacho, my dick hit the spot though
Pussy tighter than conditions of us black folks
We in the final stretch (C'mere), the last part of sex
I bust a fat-ass nut, then I woke up next (Holy)
Like, what the fuck is goin' on here? (Shit!) This bitch evaporated
Pussy and all just picked up and vacated
And now I'm frustrated, 'cause my dick was unprotected (Damn!)
And doctor Wesley tellin' me I really got that shit (Fuck!)

[Chorus: Eminem]
That's why I ain't got no time
For these games and stupid tricks
Or these bitches on my dick
That's how dudes be gettin' sick
That's how dicks be gettin' drips
Fallin' victims to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fuckin' chickens with no ribs
That's why I ain't got no time

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Now I don't wanna hit no woman, but this chick's got it comin'
Someone better get this bitch 'fore she gets kicked in the stomach
And she's pregnant, but she's eggin' me on, beggin' me to throw her
Off the steps of this porch, my only weapon is force
And I don't wanna resort to violence of any sort
Though what's she shovin' me for? (Bitch!) Doesn't she love me no more?
Wasn't she huggin' me four minutes ago at the door?
Man, I'm this close to goin' toe-to-toe with this whore
What would you do if she was tellin' you she wants a divorce?
She's havin' another baby in a month, and it's yours
And you found out it isn't, 'cause this bitch has been visitin' someone else
And suckin' his dick and kissin' you on the lips when you get back to Michigan
Now the plot is thickenin' worse
‘Cause you feel like you've been stickin' your fuckin' dick in a hearse
So you're paranoid at every little cold that you get
Ever since they sold you this shit, you've been holdin' your dick
So you go to the clinic, sweatin' every minute you in it
Then the doctor comes out, lookin' like Dennis the Menace (Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
And it's obvious to everyone in the lobby it's AIDS (Sorry)
He ain't even gotta call you in his office to say it (Sorry)
So you jet back home, 'cause you gon' get that ho
When you see her, you gon' bend her fuckin' neck back, yo
'Cause you love her, you never would expect that blow
Obie told you the scoop, how could she stoop that low?
Jesus, I don't believe this bitch works at the cleaner's
Bringin' me home diseases, swingin' from Obie's penis
She's so deceivin', shit, this ho's a genius, she G'd us

[Chorus: Eminem]
That's why I ain't got no time
For these games and stupid tricks
Or these bitches on my dick
That's how dudes be gettin' sick
That's how dicks be gettin' drips
Fallin' victims to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fuckin' chickens with no ribs
That's why I ain't got no time

[Outro: Eminem & Obie Trice]
I'm busy, yeah, fuck these bitches!
Fuck 'em all!
Get money, Shady Records
Ha, whoa!
Obie Trice! Eminem, motherfucker!
New millennium shit, yeah
Turn this shit off, man
Turn this shit the fuck—

[Intro: Drake]
(Dramatic, nigga!)
Well, alright, here I go

[Verse 1: Drake]
I'm a rapper-turned-singer, and you can tell that he smoke
But I don't need my vocal cords, all I hit is C-notes
N.E.R.D. flow, I spaz if I'm pre-voked
I'm about to change the fucking game, pass the remote
Money is everything, and it's every other thing
I'm part of the choir, that's the motto that my brother sing
Cash is the right now, women are postgame
MoneyOverBitches dot com, check the domain
It's coming too soon, album on the way
People ask me if I pray, I say, "Yeah, once in a blue moon"
Oops, I mean a red moon, I did it again, Tune
Let me leave a space in for your Blood affiliation, I state
Heavy metaphors, flow so overweight
I could rap around these other young'un's like a cobra snake
Frostbite Drizzy, nigga, nobody as cold as Drake
Keep your ass in-line, don't be tryna roller skate
Fuck all the discrete shit, I get on some deep shit
I am 21, tell me, who do I compete with?
I'm on my elite shit, you could tell I'm real
'Cause I'm gettin' hood love and I ain't even talkin' street shit
Young Angel, Young Lion, I'm done tryin'
I'm just doin', who's drinkin'? 'Cause I'm buyin'
It's on me, everything is on me
And my girl is still down like she's fuckin' Jon B
And when I go dumb, I tend to do dumb shit
I just listened back and now I'm sounding like a trumpet
This for all the strippers 'cause I know that they gone bump it
Tell 'em, "Back it up and dump it, back it, back it up and dump it"
Ain't no pistols here, your money will disappear
My accountant will feed his family off my fiscal year
Tax brackets and back-and-forth faxes
My money coming full circle, get up on my axis
Nebby, I'ma kill 'em, only 'cause I promised
They think I'm bein' cocky, but I'm only bein' honest
I'm swallowin' the Goose, got a model gettin' loose
And I never party 'less I got some bottles in the booth
I just walk up on the scene, I'm about to take this
I'm just havin' patience, 'cause I want it to make sense
White cup, orange pop, Tennessee State shit
Drop a four in it and appreciate the greatness, Drizzy

[Interlude: DJ Drama]
(Gangsta!) I just want y'all to remember
That this is the first mixtape you bumped
While you had a Black president

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, p-p-pass the dro
I am such a beast and you can ask them hoes
And they might even say you should leave me alone
And homie's scared, 'Cause his bitch like me
Stuntin' is a habit, get it from my daddy
Just like Shaggy, I tote that boom-bastic
I'm a rude bastard, I don't give a fuck 'bout y'all
I ain't talkin' marbles, you can pluck my balls
And yes, I'm fallin', but up, I fall
And if your bitch in heat, she could fuck my dog
I went from penny pinchin' to private planes
Never sat on any benches, I got in games
Starter, Carter, ball harder
Ten girls, penthouse suite, y'all order
Whatever y'all please: wine, crackers, and cheese
They take off their clothes and put on my tees
The supplement I've taken got me feelin' mighty
My gun and money don't split, call that shit Siamese
Yes, my watch make the frickin' time freeze
Your girl bless me, she suck my dick and I sneeze
Cheap-ass apartment, just the kitchen I need
And 18 G's is why the chicken crossed the street
Whatcha know 'bout it? My niggas so about it
If you kill everybody, they can't go to court about it
Weezy, I ignore the liars, baby, I ignite the fire
I am like a Michael Myers, leave your body in the dryer
Got the shotty on the side of me, my bad boys follow me
I'm a bad boy, obviously, pop one at your Ivy League
I don't have a rivalry, if so, you'll have a cah-sualty
Oops, I meant "a casualty," oops, I meant catastrophe"
Oops, I meant, actually, you niggas is just ass to me
And big, wet pussy is more like what I'm rather-ing
Welcome to the gathering, welcome to the burying
Or I hang you on the wall like a art gallery
You got short salary, and I got long money
I got Cash Money, I got Young Money, bitch (Gangsta!)

[Outro: DJ Drama & Lil Wayne]
See, I told y'all it'd be well worth the wait, right?
Dedication 3!
Chris, fuck with me!
C'mon, it's Mr. Thanksgiving you're talking about
Thing's for sure

[Chorus: Mos Def]
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Head's in the sky, wings raised and
She's about to fly, and take her place in
Out there in the stars, when she leaves the ground
She'll see a broken heart, if she turns around
But ain't no going back, this is how it must be
He told her she'll be burned alive, she just told him, "Trust me"
If funerals are beautiful, this ugly
Knowing this, he told her, "You won't leave me if you love me"
And he knows that, because he knows her
Hard to hide his feelings, as it engulfs her
Now she's a bright blaze, light rays
A shooting out, a phoenix on fire burning up the nightscape
So let's hear it for our heroine
Applaud as her spirit just flies into the never-end
One closed chapter, it opens up another part
So this is more like, "The end, question mark"

[Chorus: Mos Def]
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Don't let me hold you back, I only hold you back
We're on a dead-end street, this block has got a cul-de-sac
So fly baby, my baby so high
Sometimes it's so hard to say bye
We made it from the alley, straight up to the valley
We pulled up at the valet, we'll teach our daughter ballet
We'll raise us a Beyonce, maybe she'll be a Halle
You woulda been the best mom, I woulda been the best 'Ye
You see it all in my veins, like varicose
I know that's very gross, but we getting very close
To our end, though I kill most with a pen
Soon as this flow end, I'ma let Mos begin

[Chorus: Mos Def & Kanye West]
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial

[Chorus: Kanye West & Big Sean]
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
How could you do it? How could you do it?

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Okay, now baby, here we go, we go, no baby, me go
You got my heart, baby, this what it beat for
I give it all, walk as far as my feet go
What you mean, "Me go?" Why can't it be, "We go"?
What happens when people turn to tears? (Huh?)
Dreams turn to memories and weeks turn to years, huh?
Been standing in the same spot for a couple of weeks
Give me my feelings back, wish love came with a couple receipts
Man, our vacation was coming next week
Girl, I swear you was a trip, let's make it a couples' retreat (Do it!)
How could my girl do this to me?
Woke up to a note saying, "The world did this to me"
Now I'm testing, one-two, reporting live from the rubble
Drinking all I can so I can turn to fire when I hug you
One, two, three, four, five models on the double
Give me head all at once, look like they lying in a huddle
But it's not even half the feeling
As hearing your, "Seans, you know I love you"
Shedding tears every day (I know you do)
And I'm tired of lying in these puddles
I ask "Why?" sometimes like a fucking vowel
Been hitting trees every day like a fucking owl
Trying to get high enough to cut the clouds
Of the Phoenix sun and Nash it out
I mean ash it out, so I could see you smile
I-I know you can see me now

[Chorus: Mos Def]
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial

[Intro: T.I. & Young Jeezy]
Crème de la crème, homie, top shelf you know
I like my beat down low, down low, down low, down low
Down low, down low, down low, I like my top let back
Let back, let back, let back let back, let back
Chea, you already know what this shit is nigga, remix nigga
Mannie Fresh, T.I.P what up, nigga? I got'cha nigga
I'ma show these niggas what to do on you, nigga

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
I let my chain hang low get that thing up on my waist
All them haters talking reckless tell 'em say it to my face
Concealed bankroll, yeah, I almost caught a case
It's the remix so Mannie Fresh drop the bass
I say now 28 inches got me sitting so high
Reach straight up through the clouds God damn I'm in the sky
Got my 87 zone, goddammit I'm fly
Bet you anything won't nann' nigga try it
I push the Yukon Wednesday, the drop-top Monday
Ice cream Impala same color as a sundae
So you can miss me with that hating and that "He can't rap shit"
Tell them faggot-ass niggas wrap their lips around my dick
Goddamn my money's sick, hey, I need to see a doctor
Black on black Bentley call it "Phantom of the Opera"
Lemon-lime drop top, I call it a Sprite
When I pull out the garage you can call it a night

[Chorus: T.I.]
I like my beat down low and my top let back
Can see me ridin' 24's with a chopper in the back
You like your Kenwood hot and your top let back
If your rims sit high and your windows pitch black
I like my beat down low and my top let back
Can see me ridin' 24's with a chopper in the back
You like your Kenwood hot and your top let back
If your rims sit high and your windows pitch black

[Verse 2: Young Dro]
Dro, my trunk gon' break the damn law
I'm riding through the hood with eighths of damn raw
Them 27's tall but them eights are damn raw
Bitches know they see the platinum is gray like grandpa
Spray the Chevy all kind of sour apple colors
Diamonds up in my charm look like pineapple suckers
TEC-9 for some, MAC-90 for others
Lethal weapon on Ducati's, I got on my Danny Glovers
Nah, this ain't the movie, but I shot four brothers
And plus I gotta Chevelle that flop four colors
Cars without the covers, my beat down low
I let my rims sit high, I'm the best thing blowing now

[Chorus: T.I.]
I like my beat down low and my top let back
Can see me ridin' 24's with a chopper in the back
You like your Kenwood hot and your top let back
If your rims sit high and your windows pitch black
I like my beat down low and my top let back
Can see me ridin' 24's with a chopper in the back
You like your Kenwood hot and your top let back
If your rims sit high and your windows pitch black

[Verse 3: Big Kuntry]
I got my treble up high and my beat down low
I don't slam no doors, hop in where the roof go
What I need a roof fo', replace it with the sky
Streets be mine with that Georgia on my mind
I ride in the wettest paint, like I'm surfing on a tidal wave
Cocaine whip, yeah, straight out the microwave
Man in the trunk, sound like the man knockin'
Five pass rocking with stacks in my pockets

[Verse 4: B.G.]
I got money in my pocket and my mind on mo'
To hear myself think, I like my beat down low
Cigarello full of 'dro and the chevy two-toned
It's sitting on chromes, that's how I get my roll on
Gotta dip through the hood, you know Gizzle keep it real
I see some hot girls, so I'm a turn it up a lil'
Let them bounce to the music, ba-bounce to the beat
The top down, hop in and ride with a G

[Chorus: T.I.]
I like my beat down low and my top let back
Can see me ridin' 24's with a chopper in the back
You like your Kenwood hot and your top let back
If your rims sit high and your windows pitch black
I like my beat down low and my top let back
Can see me ridin' 24's with a chopper in the back
You like your Kenwood hot and your top let back
If your rims sit high and your windows pitch black

[Verse 5: T.I.]
Even though I like my beat down low and my top let back
Chrome feet down low and my impala wet black
Digi dash, hit the gas tell them niggas check that
Make them bitches sit back woofers give 'em wet cats
Coming down in a Chevy motor sound like it very tight
It is you can tell I hear the tire yelling er' light
808 ain't even kicking I bet you could still hear it
Lord forbid I cut it up, I bet I could let Phil hear it
Okay my money real big, choppers is still hid
They catch me with it fuck it I'm doing my lil' bid
And my drop top riding with my Glock cocked riding
I'm looking for them niggas where they at stop hiding

[Outro: T.I.]
Now that's a motherfuckin' remix nigga

[Intro]
David-David-David-David-David Banner
La, la-la la la, la-la-la, la
La, la-la la la, la-la-la, la
La La, la-la la la, la-la-la, la, la
La, la-la la la, la-la-la, la

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Ugh, sittin' in a Caddy, Wright like Betty
Floatin' up the aisle like the bride and her daddy
Hip-hop addict, hip-hop addict
Man, I swear I'm on top like the attic
Yeah, bitch, I be with my dog like Shaggy
And we stay clean, but we get dirty like Harry
Flyer than bluebirds, cardinals and canaries
Fuck me, I'm all about "oui" like Paris—
Hilton, presidential suite already
I'm richer than Nicole, and I'm a lion like her daddy
I am hotter than the Sun-day after Sat'day
I swear, I'm a savage like Lil Webbie and Randy
Oscar De La Hoya, box ya like a casket
Or Diego Corrales, nigga, keep jabbin'
See, my style, it varies, like drugs in a alley
My leather so soft, my paint prettier than Halle
Wittier than comedy, nigga write a parody
But I ain't tellin' jokes... apparently
A parent, yeah, my daughter be the twinkle of my eye
You hurt her, you kill me, and nigga, I ain't 'bout to die
See y'all are at ground, and my daughter is my sky
I swear, I look in her face and I just want to break out and fly
Four tears in my face, and you ain't never heard me cry
I'm richer than all y'all, I got a bank full of pride
Oww!

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Started out hustlin' (Ended up ballin')
Nigga I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet
Started with my girlfriend, ended with her homies
Started out hustlin' (Ended up ballin')
Started out hustlin' (Ended up ballin')
Started out hustlin' (Ended up ballin')
Nigga, I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet (Ahhh, haaaa)

[Verse 2: Brisco]
My paint Bubblicious, the motor so vicious
The rims the same color as the wrapper of a Kisses (Hershey's)
I'm hyphy, somethin' like a piston
And when I'm in Detroit, I be ballin' like a Piston
Oh, and did I mention? I'm fly like a pigeon
Higher than gas prices, you Las Vegas trickin'
I'm nine under par in a Bentley golf cart
The Polo be cream, but the Prada's caviar
Weezy, I'm sick from all this tourin'
He told me, "Sip this, and call me in the morning"
Yeah, and I vowed to never trust another woman
In my life—then, I got horny

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Started out hustlin' (Ended up ballin')
Nigga I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet
Started with my girlfriend, ended with her homies
Started out hustlin' (Ended up ballin')
Started out hustlin' (Ended up ballin')
Started out hustlin' (Ended up ballin')
Nigga, I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
See I ain't goin' nowhere, bitch, you know a nigga been home, honey
Money fuckin' retarded, call it "Down Syndrome money"
My cake sick, shit, been diagnosed, "sickle cell bread"
My revenue stream got a disease like a jail bed
Like a mattress from Sing-Sing or way down in Comstock
These bitches call me "Bling King," I shit when the bomb drop
And sprinkle diamonds all over niggas, flawless and D-Class
Then twinkle like a shine, just like a sparkle from clean glass
They movin' on a nigga as I'm walkin' the valley, ready
And zoomin' with the cameras like I'm dickin' down Halle Berry
My money help me do things that you niggas can't believe
Like purchase purses, places, all them things that you can't conceive
Like interactin' with women the caliber of Janet
I sit and master my vision and massacre the planet (Whoa!)
I hope you niggas know just what it is
While I'm countin' my paper, niggas know I'm handlin' my biz
(Okay)

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Started out hustlin' (Ended up ballin')
Nigga I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet
Started with my girlfriend, ended with her homies
Started out hustlin' (Ended up ballin')
Started out hustlin' (Ended up ballin')
Started out hustlin' (Ended up ballin')
Nigga, I'm the shit, get the fuck up out my toilet

[Intro]
Yeah, and it go a little somethin'
Li-li-like this

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Now little Lisa's only nine years old
She's tryin to figure out why the world is so cold
Why she's all alone and they never met her family
Momma's always gone and she never met her daddy
Part of her is missin and nobody'll listen
Momma's on drugs gettin high up in the kitchen
Bringin home men at different hours of the night
Startin with some laughs, usually endin in a fight
Sneakin in her room when her momma's knocked out
Tryin to have his way and little Lisa says ouch
She tries to resist but then all he does is beat her
Tries to tell her mom but her momma don't believe her
Lisa's stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get some clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and never come back (Like this)

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Little Nicole is only ten years old
She's steady tryin to figure why the world is so cold
Why she's not pretty and nobody seems to like her
Alcoholic stepdad always wanna strike her
Yells and abuses, leaves her with some bruises
Teachers ask questions, she's makin up excuses
Bleedin on the inside, cryin on the out
It's only one girl really knows what she's about
Her name is little Stacy and they become friends
Promise that they'll always be tight 'til the end
Until one day lil' Stacy gets shot
A drive-by bullet went stray up on her block
Now Nicole's stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get her clothes and pack
She says she's 'bout to run away and NEVER come back

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Little Erica is eleven years old
She's steady tryin to figure why the world is so cold
So she pops X to get rid of all the pain
Plus she's havin sex with her boy who's sixteen
Emotions run deep as she thinks she's in love
So there's no protection, he's usin no glove
Never thinkin 'bout the consequences of her actions
Livin for today and not tomorrow's satisfaction
The days go by and her belly gets big
The father bails out, he ain't ready for a kid
Knowin her momma would blow it all out of proportion
Plus she lives poor so no money for abortion
Erica is stuck up in a world on her own
Forced to think that hell is a place called home
Nothin else to do but get her clothes and pack
She says she 'bout to run away and NEVER come back, ah!

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)
Runaway love (love love) runaway love (love love)

[Refrain: Mary J. Blige]
Runaway, runaway love
Don't keep runnin' away
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
Run it, run it, run it, run it, ah-ah
Don't keep runnin', runnin' away
Don't, don't keep runnin', runnin' away
I know how you feel, I've been there
I was runnin' away too
I will run away with you, I will run away with you
Runaway, runaway love
Don't keep runnin' away
I'll run away with you, if you want me to

[Outro: Ludacris]
Yeah, I can only imagine what you goin through ladies
Sometimes I feel like runnin away myself
So do me a favor right now and close your eyes
And picture us runnin away together
When we come back everything gonna be okay
Open your eyes

[Intro: Mac Miller]
Woah

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Ayy, lace 'em up, lace 'em up, lace 'em up, lace 'em
Blue suede shoes stay crispy like bacon
Nikes on my feet make my cypher complete, uh
I stay shining like the lights on the street in the night
Revis take me shoppin' when I'm up in New York
Hit the shoe store, go and cop a few more
You at the mall getting dinner at the food court
I'm in LA eatin' twenty-two course
Young boss, bitch, paper in my pockets
I got a closet filled with shoeboxes
Mom said my spending habit little bit obnoxious
But a pilot stay fresh up in his cockpit
Used to rock hand-me-downs
Now I buy some clothes, wear 'em out
Hit the club, bitches pull they cameras out
Livin' in a dream, they beginnin' to believe
My hotel smell like cigarettes and weed
Shit, with what I'm spittin', they should give me a degree
Good liquor, what I'm sippin' isn't cheap, uh
Finna blow, don't snooze, don't sleep
All I really need is some shoes on my feet

[Chorus: Nas & Mac Miller]
And the Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete

And the Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete

Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nikes

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
I make 'em so mad, they got no swag
Pippens on my feet, they the throwbacks, look
My money good, but these hoes bad
So they stay attached to my gonads, uh
Wakin' up to a few L's
Open up my closet to that new shoe smell
I guess I'm doin' well
Smokin' all the weed that I used to sell
But once my album goes in the shelves
It's going Nextel how it's finna sell
For now, we're sellin' tapes out my shoebox
Any spot, just set up my shop
You're mad that your girl always says that I'm hot
She buyin' my t-shirts, but she spendin' your guap, uh
Say, "What up?" if you see me around
Nike Airs separate my feet from the ground, it's just

[Chorus: Nas & Mac Miller]
And the Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete
Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nike-Nikes (Yeah)
And the Nikes on my feet keep my cypher complete

[Intro - Big Sean]
Ay, Big!
They say they want something real
Thats what I’mma give em
And if I keep it real how could they not feel it

Hey yeah
Can you say GOOD music?
Can you say GOOD music?

[Verse 1]
Let me tell you about a bad ass chick
Everybody wanna grab her
Tryna climb on that looking for a ladder
Niggas wanna stab her, dag her, dag it
Everybody want it
Ain't too many had it
Beauty and brains, went to all the classes
Graduated too even went and got a masters
Bad ass chick probably could have been an actress
So what she do?
She want to be an actress
Moved to Manhatton, shit got real
Took acting classes with Denzel
Leading lady like Hillary grabbing big Bills
Commercial money baby, ten thousand and a mill
Yeah, plus she had a baby boy
And the nigga she was with she couldn’t love more
Still want more, shit, she on a roll
Move to Hollywood, she could probably get a role
And she did, but realised the nigga wasn’t shit
Addicted to the broads and on top of this she pregnant
With another boy
Honestly thought abort but still had the boy
Lets name him Sean
Honestly probably after Connery
One of her favourite actors but acting ain't promising
Ay yo I know there was certain things that was meant for you
And thats why I’m giving you

[Hook]
(Whatever you want)
This whatever you want
(Before)
Just tell me
(Whatever you want)
You deserve whatever you want
(Before)
I won’t stop till you get whatever you want
(All the lights)
All the lights
(The love, dreams you blew away
For your baby boy
Hold on, I'm on my way
(whatever you want)

[Intro]
"Other man!"

I stand in slapped by the wind as I begin
Do you know who I am? And many reply with a grin
Yes, I'm tired of being obtruded
Why should I be secluded? I've got a brand new horn to be tooted
To sum it up in a nutshell, "Eminem will you kick it for me?"
So I find myself in a certain obligatory
A place that I dwell in, fell into some wonderful productions
To make up for lost time, and then it brings obstruction
Finally let loose, unloading the stockpile
A mental projectile, I aim at the reptile
I look to the one handed juggler and ask him this
"Why is it you insist upon stepping to an octopus?"
Is there a reason for this? The hindrance is aggravating
How many times will it take you before you realize you're fading?
Fading from existence, cause simulations are dead
There's so much more to learn and pages left to be read
So put up the front while you jam for the grammar that's poor
While I hold the scrapbook that's heavier than the hammer of the mighty Thor
Words can weigh a ton
Therefore it's never to fall into the hands of the wrong one

[Scratched samples] - "Yeah", "It's another

Very few have made an attempt to put in a foot on the other side
But I see no borderline, from under this colorblind
And some will probably never hold pieces of the sacred
But then I'm finally about to put an end to the hatred
Wrong, the world would never endure to arguing
Awaking to the absence of unity is startling
"Oh foolish pride, what the hell are you trying to do?
You cannot beat someone that's better than you so quit trying to"
Your echoing words that mean nothing are despicable
So how do you think you can manage to kick the unkickable
You're graceless, bland, you're tasteless and you're faceless faceless
Damn, you're dull it's time you faced this, here taste this
Straight from off of the pile, one of the numerous styles
The date of my birth on the Earth, the deliverance of a starchild
Blessed with formidable talent and versatility
But with such a power, there comes a responsibilty
To infringe on the boundaries, so now the defiance is clear
To form an alliance is something even the giants fear
So instead of being oblivious to the color of skin
Refusal of usin' is accepted now it's a trend

[Scratched samples] - "Yeah", "It's another..."

[Eminem]
You know I don't understand why we all just can't get along
You hate me but you know me and what I stand for
No. so then why do you speak for me
And every other white man when you that we're your enemy?

On the floor lies a broken door, cause I'm not to be spoken for
Stereotypes and superstitions and fictional folklore
Rarely do you see the lighter side of me
I try to be persuasive but also invasive and try to end the rivalry
But ? is isolated, apologies are exhausted
Feelings are turning glacial never to be defrosted
Who can I trust after repeatedly being shafted
Switch to the opposite, now scenes are being re-enacted
Pull up that boy by his roots, destroy him quick
His fracture's obviating, we hate him, his patterns past us, huh
Always fighting for the position of top dog
That spot's already occupied, and I don't play leapfrog
Cause I do not wish to fight over territory that's already mine
But I'm always having to prove myself, time after time
Oh how I never understand how a man could be outcast
Judged from the past and he's put last
And others with nothing to say
Stutterin' and slurrin' and mutterin' words with no meaning attack be signin' like Danny Kaye
Here I go again hammerin stammerin grammerin
And eat it like cheese, pass me the crackers please
I've got a craving

[Verse 1]
I'm in love with you girl cause you're on my mind
You're the one I think about most every time
And when you crack a smile in everything you do
Don't you understand, girl, this love is true
You’re soft, silky hand long, sweet and thin
That candlelight complexion upon your skin
It lightens up my day, and that's oh so true
Together we're one separated we're two
To make you all mine, all mine is my desire
Cause you contain a quality that I admire
You're pretty plain and simple, you rule my world so try to understand
I'm in love girl
I'm in so love girl
I'm just in love girl, and this is true

[Hook]
Girl, you know it's true
Ooh, Ooh, Ooh I love you
Yes, you know it's true
Ooh, Ooh, Ooh I love you
Girl, you know it's true
My love is for you

[Verse 2]
This is some sort of thing, girl, I can't explain
My emotions starts up when I hear your name
Maybe your sweet sweet voice would ring in my ear
Then delay my system when you are near
Come with your positive emotion, love, making enjoyin
That's for me to bust it's like a girl and a boy
These feelings I get I often wonder why
So I thought I might discuss this, girl, just you and I
Now what you're wearing I don't care, as I've said before
No reason that I like you, girl, just for what you are
If I said I'd think about it, you rule my world so try to understand
I'm in love girl
I'm in so love girl
I'm just in love girl, and this is true

[Intro: JAY-Z]

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
No clouds in my stones
Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank
Coming down with the Dow Jones
When the clouds come, we gone, we Roc-A-Fella
We fly higher than weather, in G5's or better
You know me (You know me)
In anticipation for precipitation, stack chips for the rainy day
Jay—Rain Man is back
With Little Miss Sunshine, Rihanna, where you at?

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
You have my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby, ‘cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share
Because

[Chorus: Rihanna]
When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh-eh

[Verse 3: Rihanna]
These fancy things
Will never come in between
You're part of my entity
Here for infinity
When the war has took its part
When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart
Because

[Chorus: Rihanna]
When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh-eh

[Bridge: Rihanna]
You can run into my arms
It's okay, don't be alarmed
Come into me
There's no distance in between our love
So gon' and let the rain pour
I'll be all you need and more
Because

[Chorus: Rihanna]
When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh-eh

I´m singing in the rain
Just singing in the rain
What a glorious feeling
And I´m happy again
I´m laughing at clouds
So dark, up above
The sun´s in my heart
And I´m ready for love

Let the stormy clouds chase
Everyone from the place
Come on with the rain
I have a smile on my face
I´ll walk down the lane
With a happy refrain
Just singin', singin' in the rain
Yeah, my God, Syience

[Hook]

So in case you ain't heard, observe

[Verse 1]
'Twas in another lifetime
One of toil and blood
When blackness was a virtue
The road was full of mud
I came in from the wilderness
A creature void of form
"Come in," she said, "I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm"

[Verse 2]
And if I pass this way again
You can rest assured
I'll always do my best for her
On that I give my word
In a world of steel-eyed death and men
Who are fighting to be warm
"Come in," she said, "I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm"

[Verse 3]
Not a word was spoke between us
There was little risk involved
Everything up to that point
Had been left unresolved
Try imagining a place
Where it's always safe and warm
"Come in," she said, "I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm"

[Verse 4]
I was burned out from exhaustion
Buried in the hail
Poisoned in the bushes
And blown out on the trail
Hunted like a crocodile
Ravaged in the corn
"Come in," she said, "I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm"

[Verse 5]
Suddenly I turned around
And she was standing there
With silver bracelets on her wrists
And flowers in her hair
She walked up to me so gracefully
And took my crown of thorns
"Come in," she said, "I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm"

[Verse 6]
Now there's a wall between us
Something there's been lost
I took too much for granted
I got my signals crossed
Just to think that it all began
On an uneventful morn
"Come in," she said, "I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm"

[Verse 7]
Well, the deputy walks on hard nails
And the preacher rides a mount
But nothing really matters much
It's doom alone that counts
And the one-eyed undertaker
He blows a futile horn
"Come in," she said, "I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm

[Verse 8]
I've heard newborn babies wailing
Like a mourning dove
And old men with broken teeth
Stranded without love
Do I understand your question, then
Is it hopeless and forlorn
"Come in," she said, "I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm"

[Verse 9]
In a little hilltop village
They gambled for my clothes
I bargained for salvation
And she gave me a lethal dose
I offered up my innocence
And I got repaid with scorn
"Come in," she said, "I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm"

[Verse 10]
Well, I'm living in a foreign country
But I'm bound to cross the line
Beauty walks a razor's edge
Someday I'll make it mine
If I could only turn back the clock
To when God and her were born
"Come in," she said, "I'll give ya
Shelter from the storm"

[Spoken Intro]
And disciplinary remains mercifully
Yes and um, I’m with you Derek, this star nonsense
Yes, yes, now which is it?
I am sure of it

[Twelve-string guitar Intro]

[Verse]
So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell? Blue skies from pain?
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?
Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees? Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change? Did you exchange
A walk-on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

[Acoustic Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl year after year
Running over the same old ground, what have we found?
The same old fears, wish you were here

[Instrumental Outro & Scatting]

[Intro: Bruno Mars]
I wanna be a billionaire so fricking bad
Buy all of the things I never had

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah, I would be the host of
Everyday Christmas, give Travie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit
Give away a few Mercedes, like, here lady have this
And last but not least, grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single so
You can call me Travie Claus minus the ho-ho
Aha, get it?
I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid
Everywhere I go, I'mma have my own theme music

[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
I wanna be a billionaire so fricking bad
Buy all of the things I never had
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Oh, every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights
A different city every night
I swear, the world better prepare
For when I’m a billionaire

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Billionaire dollar crib, stadium, theatre
Personal ball cleaner, the closet's all Gators
I'm eating this morning, break-fast
I'mma need 1st place, I refuse to take last
You can hear the wordplay on the top of the bass-clap
You niggas is all drop-outs, you hate class
Until them umbrellas pop out, splish-splash
Ain't no rain on her blou-ouse, get back
Cause them doors close by themselves
Oh, no-no-no, I don't need nobody help
They say I'm backwards cause the doors on my Phantom open up the wrong way
And I'm like no, homeboy, you just making the wrong pay

[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
I wanna be a billionaire so fricking bad
Buy all of the things I never had
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen

[Bridge]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Wanna know where I am, there is nothing wrong, nothing wrong
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Even back to the ghetto, ghetto, ohh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
This car and those cribs, I need it all
Oh ooh, oh ooh, for when I’m a Billionaire

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Gucci Mane la Flare in the building, yeah
Right back like I never even went nowhere
Growing up, I dreamed I would be a billionaire
And when the Jordans came, I could buy a billion pair
Cause zillionaires swagged up, swear it ain't fair
Lames lay game and they too too square
Life's too short to sit back and look
Every night is a movie, my life's a book
Money rules the world, but money runs to me
You can't put a price tag on what God's done for me
I wanna be a billionaire so freaking bad
So I can tell all my haters to kiss my ass
It's Gucci

[Outro: Bruno Mars]
I wanna be a billionaire so fricking bad
Buy all of the things I never had
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen

[Verse 1]
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?"
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus 1]
People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts" (Hee-hee)
And mother always told me, "Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth" (Oh-oh)
Hey-ay

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son, hoo!
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no-no, hee-hee-hee)
Hoo!

[Verse 2]
For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, hee!
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (A-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
(Ooh, hee-hee-hee)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"
(Don't break no hearts!) (Hee-hee)
But she came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume (Ha-oh)
This happened much too soon (Ha-oh, ha-ooh)
She called me to her room (Ha-oh, hoo!)
Hey-ay

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover (Hoo!)
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no-no-no (Hoo!)
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh baby)
But the kid is not my son (Oh, no, no)
She says I am the one (Oh baby)
But the kid is not my son (No, hee-hee!)

[Break]
Ah, hee-hee-hee!
Hee! Hoo!

[Chorus]
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
No-no-no, hoo! (Ouw!)
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
(You know what you did to me, baby)
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no (No-no-no, no-no-no)
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son (No-no-no-no)

[Outro]
She says I am the one
You know what you did
She says he is my son
Breakin' my heart, babe
She says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover (She is just a girl)
Billie Jean is not my lover (She is just a girl)
(Don't call me Billie Jean)
Billie Jean is not my lover (She is just a girl)
(Hoo! She's not at the scene)
Billie Jean is not (Hee! Aaow! Ooh!)
Billie Jean is

[Intro: Ludacris]
DTP we got them guns that go

Yea I'm all about that pistol player, cold blooded killer

You’ll find a hole inside your chest, just for thinking it's rap
So tell that pretty bitch thug we got some pretty big gats
Chaka say I'm shot out, and I tend to agree
So you should watch what you saying if it's intended for me
So be careful what you starting, let my fingers do the walking
And that Uzi get to talking like *Gun Sound*

[Verse 2: Tity Boi]
Hammers, jam 'em, snatch 'em, grab 'em

Bake him, take him, beat him up, I hate a hater, I eat him up
A-B-C-D-E-F shawty is you a G or what
Now it's just me and my nuts, that's all I got in this world
I'm pulling pistols out my stomach and throwing them bitches up like earl
Serving the club, head shot, scattered, covered, run, scram 'em
I'm 38, hot with a pearl handle
And I'm throwing techs like a NBA ref

Artillery, could it be I got all kinds of these pistols
I point my gun at ya homeboy make ya own folks hit ya
And they ain't taking no more pictures, if you snap I'mma click
Anyway, plus I got bullets in the clip the size of Lil Fate
And I'm waving choppers like heli-copters
You gonna need hella doctors, when the glok go *Gun Sound*

[Verse 3: Chingy]
Say on the set bitch, better watch your lip those Tecs spit quick
20 over thurr, Tity over thurr, Luda over thurr, ain't no exit trick

Reload with the next clip, I'm the wrong nigga to flex with bitch
Come on and test this, my gun I'm having sex with shit
Put a bullet in (in) shoot it out, got them long horns like Texas bitch
Look at my necklace, maybe hit a nigga disrespect this click

Y’all  cowards play tough, and my peeps we come to spray stuff up
Y’all  lives made up, like ugly hoes with make-up bra
We'll shoot you up then toss yo ass in the lake tough nut
My wrist rocky like Sylvester Stallone
So therefore you should invest, in a vest for your dome
Cause I know you marks planning on getting me when I'm landing
Peace to Nick, but my cannon go *Gun Sound*

[Verse 4: Ludacris]
Fuck a medic, we gonna call yo ass a taxi cab
Bleeding so hard you'll need a life size maxi pad
So flip the script and tell your woman its your time of the month
AK-47 for the niggas who's really looking for heaven and a 9 for you chumps
Got killers in my squad and I'm the nicest one in my group
But I got bananas for you niggas and I ain't talking bout fruit
I’ll peel your cap back with the black mac
'Til your back crack, cock the gat back like (clak clak clak)
Swallow a hollow make 'em digest with a 50 caliber
Your futures not looking so good, tomorrows not on your calendar
I do away with the amateurs, they breathing too long
Ill leave 'em coughing like the sound effects you hear in this song
My shotguns are cold and hard, but my desert is easy
And my triggers are always talking about some squeeze me, squeeze me
And for these fakers talking greasy, I'm starting the show
My uzi got a drum roll, it goes *Gun Sound*

{Indistinct Chatter and Gunshots}

C'mon, boy
I've been waiting for somebody to pick up my stroll, ah
Ah, well, don't waste time
Give me a sign, tell me how you wanna roll, mmm
I want somebody to speed it up for me, then take it down slow
There's enough room for both
Well, I can handle that, you just gotta show me where it's at
Are you ready to go? Are you ready to go?
(Fikki fikki, fikki fikki, come on)

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna & Justin Timberlake]
If you want it, you already got it
If you thought it, it better be what you want
If you feel it, it must be real just
Say the word, and I'mma give you what you want

[Chorus: Madonna, Justin Timberlake]
Time is waiting
We only got four minutes to save the world

Grab a boy, then grab a girl
Time is waiting

So keep it up, keep it up
Don't be a pri-hey-Madonna, uh

That's right, keep it up, keep it up
Don't be a pri-hey-Madonna, uh
You gotta get 'em on, hop
(Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock)

[Verse 2: Madonna, Justin Timberlake]
Sometimes I think what I need is a "you" intervention, yeah
And you know I can tell that you like it
And that it's good, by the way that you move, oh, hey
The road to hell is paved with good intentions, yeah
But if I die tonight, at least I can say I did what I wanted to do
Tell me, how 'bout you?

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna & Justin Timberlake, (Timbaland)]
If you want it, you already got it
If you thought it, it better be what you want (Come on)

[Outro: Timbaland, Madonna]
Breakdown, yeah

(Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock)
I only got four minutes, to save the world

[Intro]
(Yawn)
Alright, run it
I never gave a fuck
I never gave a fuck about what niggas thought about me
I mean, I did, but like, fuck it, you know what I'm saying?
You gon' love me, man
You gon' love me, man

[Verse 1]
They can't comprehend
Or even come close to understanding him
I guess if I was boring they would love me more
Guess if I was simple in the mind, everything would be fine
Maybe if I was a jerk to girls
Instead of being nice and speaking kind words
Then maybe it would be okay to say then
I wasn't a good guy to begin with

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But my mind is all crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
They got me thinking I ain't human
Like I came in from above, above, above, above
Feeling like an airplane in the sky
But then they say I'm crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
They got me thinking I ain't human
Like I came in from above, above, above, above
Feeling like a bird sitting high, high

[Chorus]
I be that man on the moon, I'm that man on the moon
And I'mma do what I do, so do you, hey-hey
I be posted with my blunt and a brew, my dude
I'm that man on the moon, I'm up-up on the moon

[Interlude]
It's like, I'mma play all my stuff for everybody
And you know, and all my people they give me feedback
You know, and they'll be like
"Yo, yo, why, why your shit sound so different?"
You know what I'm saying?
"Why your shit, like on another level-Why's, why's it sound so different?"
Like that's a bad thing
And I be like
"Why not, nigga?"

[Verse 2]
Close my eyes, high in the dark
It's a curtain call; come one, come all
All I do is try to make it simple
The ones that make it complicated
Never get congratulated
I'm something different, all aspects
Don't want a woman just to love her assets
I'll still wife her up, even with her flat chest
The type to get hurt, but that's the past tense

[Pre-Chorus 2]
My mind is all hazy, hazy, hazy, hazy
I be thinkin' that I'm wrong
'Cause they used to call me lame, lame, lame, lame
My swag was a little different
But then my mind is hazy, hazy, hazy, hazy
I be thinkin' that I'm wrong
But they the ones who lame, lame, lame, lame
I got the last laugh, nigga

[Chorus]
I be that man on the moon, I'm that man on the moon
And I'mma do what I do, so do you, hey-hey
I be posted with my blunt and a brew, my dude
I'm that man on the moon, I'm up-up on the moon

[Verse 1]
Young Money till the young boy dyin' out
You hear me cryin' out
You see me ridin’ out
And if your man get to stuntin’
We’ll buy 'em out
Cause we be livin’ what these other rappers lyin' bout
Drizzy Drake, what
Funk Flex, uhh
Hot 9-7, I’m so far gone

Feelin' good, feelin' great, how you though?
Bet you hear my name every single place that you go
Sippin’ on pink shit, but nah it ain't Nuvo
Slow the F down 'fore yo ass is on Pluto
Tell me what it do
I belong to the youngest Grammy nominated crew
My city love me, but I got Toronto haters too
That sit around and talk about
What they’d have done if they was you
But know I ball without a sphere in sight
Club owners give me reasons to appear at night
And just know thatIbe in the mirror like
Are you listenin’? I hope you hearin' right
I’m in the Aston doin' doughnuts
I will kill the game and never send it my condolence
Taught to never love a chick and only love the moments
New York City, I can tell the people want it
Uhh, what you got for me flex, uh

[Verse 2]
Vacuum interiors and shined wheels
What's ya life like? This how mine feels
I like my seat back, I like my wine chill
I look good, smell better, and I rhyme ill
I say I’m at these girls neck and head
You and your girl sleep in separate beds
I killed this, tell Flex it's dead
You got birthday cake, mines weddin' tall
Y'all lemon small, y'all never ball
I get the girl of your dreams and I never call
NY, I got it, I'm bout whatever y'all
Yeah, 40 hears my interviews, tone it down
I’m at your girls condo gettin' shown around
Yeah, why you takin' everything personal?
This that in-ya-face, all-offensive-on-purpose flow
My city, never F’n need me
Yeah, oh wait no they really need me
Oh wait, hold up, Young F’n Weezy
Holla at me when you done F’n Weezy

[Intro: Justin Vernon]
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still to slow down the time
I'm up in the woods, I'm down on my mind
I'm building a still, down the time

[Chorus: Kanye West & Justin Vernon]
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
Down for the night, said she's down for the night
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Slow down the time), ooh
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm new in the city, but I'm down for the night
Down for the night, down for the night

[Verse: Kanye West]
You're my devil, you're my angel
You're my heaven, you're my hell
You're my now, you're my forever
You're my freedom, you're my jail
You're my lies, you're my truth
You're my war, you're my truce
You're my questions, you're my proof
You're my stress and you're my masseuse
Ma-ma-se, ma-ma-se, ma-ma-ku-sa
Lost in this plastic life
Let's break out of this fake-ass party
Turn this into a classic night
If we die in each other's arms
Still get laid in the afterlife
If we die in each other's arms
Still get laid, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Kanye West & Elly Jackson]
Run from the lights, run from the night, run for your life
Down for the night, down for the night, down for the night

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm new in the city, and I'm down for the night
Down for the night, down for the night

[Bridge: Gil Scott Heron & Kanye West]
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America? (Down for the night)
Who will survive in America?
Who will survive in America?

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm new in the city
And I'm down for the night, down for the night
I'm lost in the world, been down my whole life
I'm new in the city
But I'm down for the night, down for a night
Oh-oh, get down

[Verse 1]
(Who is Mr Brown?)
Mr. Brown is a clown
Who rides through town in a coffin
(Where can he be found?)
In the coffin where there is three crows on top
And two is laughing

[Verse 2]
Oh, what a confusion, ooh, yeah, yeah
What a botheration, ooh, now, now
Who is Mr. Brown? I wanna know now
He is nowhere to be found

[Chorus]
From Mandeville to Sligoville
Coffin runnin' around
Upsetting, upsetting, upsetting the town
Asking for Mr. Brown
From Mandeville to Sligoville
Coffin runnin' around
Upsetting, upsetting, upsetting the town
Asking for Mr. Brown

[Verse 3]
I wanna know who (Is Mr. Brown?)
Is Mr. Brown controlled by remote?

[Bridge]
Oh, calling duppy conqueror
I'm the ghost catcher
This is your chance
Oh, big, big Bill bull-bucka
Take your chance
Prove yourself, oh yeah

[Verse 4]
Down in parade
People running like a masquerade
The police make a raid
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, think it fade

[Verse 5]
What a thing in town
Crows, chauffeur-driven around
Skanking as if they had never known
The man they call Mr. Brown
I can tell you where he's from now

From Mandeville to Sligoville
Coffin runnin' around
Upsetting, upsetting, upsetting the town
Asking for Mr. Brown...

[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
You might think you've peeped the scene
You haven't, the real one's far too mean
The watered-down one, the one you know
Was made up centuries ago
They made it sound all wack and corny
Yes, it's awful blasted boring
Twisted fictions, sick addiction
Well, gather 'round, children, zip it, listen

[Chorus: Justin Vernon & Teyana Taylor]
Can we get much higher? (So high)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh (Oh)
Can we get much higher? (So high)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Can we get much higher? (So high)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh (Oh)
Can we get much higher? (So high)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago
Mercy, mercy me, that Murciélago
That's me the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish? Mi no hablo
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs need to listen to the models
You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato? (You ain't got no Yeezy, nigga?)
Stupid, but what the hell do I know?
I'm just a Chi-Town nigga with a Nas flow
And my chick in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow

[Chorus: Justin Vernon & Teyana Taylor]
Can we get much higher?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leona Lewis
Beyond the truest
Hey, teacher, teacher, tell me how do you respond to students?
And refresh the page and restart the memory?
Re-spark the soul and rebuild the energy?
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemy
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
Fresh air, rollin' down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines, huh
And then they make noise

[Chorus: Justin Vernon & Teyana Taylor]
Can we get much higher? (So high)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

[Bridge: Justin Vernon & Kanye West]
At the mall, there was a seance
Just kids, no parents
Then the sky filled with herons
Saw the devil in a Chrysler LeBaron
And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
And the fires did declare us
But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress
And woke up back in Paris

[Chorus: Justin Vernon & Teyana Taylor]
Can we get much higher? (So high)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh

[Chorus: Justin Vernon & Teyana Taylor]
Can we get much higher? (So high)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh (Oh)
Can we get much higher? (So high)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Can we get much higher? (So high)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh (Oh)
Can we get much higher? (So high)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh

[Intro]
Who y'all talkin' to, man?
Ugh
Check it out, check it out
This here goes out to all the niggas that be fuckin' mad bitches
In other niggas' cribs
Thinkin' shit is sweet
Nigga creep up on your ass, hahaha
Live niggas respect it—check it

[Verse]
I kicked flows for you, kicked down doors for you
Even left all my motherfuckin' hoes for you
Niggas think Frankie pussy-whipped
Nigga, picture that, with a Kodak, Insta-mat-tac
We don't get down like that, lay my game down quite flat
"Sweetness, where you parked at?"
Petiteness, but that ass fat
She got a body make a nigga wanna eat that—
I'm fuckin' with you
The bitch official, though; dick harder than a missile, yo
Try to hit it, if she trippin', disappearin' like Arsenio
Yo, the bitch push a double-O with the five in front
Probably a conniving stunt
Y'all drive in front, I'ma peel with her
Find the deal with her, she fuck around and steal, huh?
Then we all get laced
Televisions, Versace heaven, when I'm up in 'em
The shit she kicked—all that shit's legit
She get dick from a player off the New York Knicks
Nigga trick ridiculous, the shit was plush
She's stressing me to fuck, like she was in a rush
We fucked in his bed, quite dangerous
I'm in his ass while he playing 'gainst the Utah Jazz
My 112 CD blast, I was past
She came twice, I came last, roll the grass
She giggle, saying, "I'm smoking on homegrown"
Then I heard a moan, "Honey, I'm home!"
Yup, tote chrome for situations like this
I'm up in his broad, I know he won't like this
Now I'm, like, "Bitch, you better talk to him
Before this fifth put a spark to him
Fuck around, shit get dark to him, put a part through him
Lose a major part to him—arm, leg..."
She beggin' me to stop, but this cat gettin' closer
Gettin' hot like a toaster, I cock the toast, ugh
Before my eyes could blink
She screams out, "Honey, bring me up somethin' to drink!"
He go back downstairs, more time to think
Her brain racing, she's telling me to stay patient
She don't know I'm cool as a fan
Gat in hand, I don't wanna blast her man
But I can and I will, though; I'm tryna chill, though
Even though situation looking kinda ill, yo
It came to me like a song I wrote
Told the bitch, "Gimme your scarf, pillowcase, and rope"
Got dressed quick, tied the scarf around my face
Roped the bitch up, gagged her mouth with the pillowcase
Played the cut, nigga coming off some Love Potion shit
Flash the heat on 'em, he stood emotionless
Dropped the glass, screaming, "Don't blast, here's the stash!
A hundred cash! Just don't shoot my ass, please!"
Nigga pulling mad G's out the floor
Put stacks in a Prada knapsack, hit the door
Grab the keys to the Five, call my niggas on the cell
"Bring some weed, I got a story to tell," ugh, ugh

[Outro]
"Yo, man, y'all niggas ain't gon' believe what the fuck happened to me. 'Member that bitch I left the club with, man?"
"Yeah."
"Yo, stinky, yo. I'm up in this bitch crib—this bitch fuck with one of them ol' Knick-ass niggas and shit. I'm up in the spot, so, you know—"
"Who, God?"
"I don't know, I don't know which one of them niggas. One of them six-five niggas, I don't know."
"Yeah."
"Anyway, I'm up in the motherfuckin' spot. So, boom, I'm up in the pussy, whatever-whatever. I sparks up some lah, Pa Duke creeps up in on some..."
"Get the fuck out!"
"Must have been rained out or something, because he's in the spot."
"Get the fuck out of here! Oh, shit!"
"Had me scared, had me scared to death! I was shook, Daddy. But I forget I had my Roscoe on me."
"Ah, yeah, I know you had the heat!"
"Always."
"Hahahaha."
"You know how we do. So anyway, the nigga comes up the stairs, he creepin' up the steps. The bitch all shook—she sends the nigga back downstairs to get some drinks and shit."
"Ooh, shit!"
"She gettin' mad nervous. But I said, 'Fuck that man! I'm the nigga!'"
"I know you was finna clap 'em."
Yeah, nigga. You know how we do it, nigga—ransom note-style. Put the scarf around my motherfuckin' face
"Aight!"
"Gagged that bitch up, and played the cizzut."
"Ahahaha!"
"Soon as this nigga comes up in the spot, I flash the Desert in his face. He drops the glass. Looked like the nigga pissed on his damn self or somethin, word to my mother! Word to my mother, yo."
"Ah, shit!"
"This nigga runs dead to the floor, peels up the carpet, start givin' me mad papers. Mad papers."
"Oh, shit, what? Yo, I told you that bitch was a scheisty bitch, cuz! Word to mother, I used to fuck with her cousin, but you ain't know that!"
"Hahaha."
"You ain't even know that shit! Really, though."
"I put all that motherfuckin' money up in the Prada knapsack, and, ugh! Two words: 'I'm gone!'"
"Hahahaha! No doubt, no doubt... No doubt!"
"Y'all niggas got some lah? Y'all got some lah?"
"No doubt!"

[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
St-st-step up in the party like my name was "That Bitch"
All these haters mad because I'm so established
They know I'm a beast, yeah, I'm a fuckin' savage
Haters, you could kill yourself (Ah)
In my space shuttle and I'm not comin' down
I'm a stereo and she's just so monotone
Sometimes, it's just me and all my bottles all alone
I ain't comin' back this time

[Pre-Chorus: will.i.am & Nicki Minaj, will.i.am & Nicki Minaj]
I can't believe it, it's so amazin'

St-st-step up in the party like my name is Mr. T
All these hating naggers ain't got nat'in' on me
Honestly, I gotta stay as fly as I can be
If you Wiki Willy, you get super OG
Honeys always rush me 'cause I'm fly, fly, fly
Dummies, they can't touch me 'cause I'm floatin' sky high
I stay niggarific, you don't need to ask why
You just gotta see with your eyes

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Da-dun-dun
The sun done, yep, the sun done
Came up, but we still up in dungeon
Da-dun-dun, yep, in London
Competition? Why, yes, I would love some
How the fuck they get mad 'cause their run done?
Mad 'cause I'm gettin' money in abundance?
Man, I can't even count all of these hundreds
Duffel bag every time I go to SunTrust
I leave the rest just to collect interest
I mean interest, fuck my nemesis
Exclamation, just for emphasis
And I don't sympathize 'cause you a simple bitch
I just pop up on these hoes on some pimple shit
And put the iron to your face, you old wrinkled bitch

[Interlude: will.i.am]
This is mega nigga, u-u-ultra enigmatic
-Matic, -matic, -matic, -ma-ma-matic

[Verse 4: will.i.am]
Oh, we just had to kill it
We on the radio, hotter than a skillet
We in the club, makin' party people holla
Money in the bank, we be gettin' top dollar
I'm a big baller, you a lil' smaller
Step up to my level, need to grow a lil' taller
I'm a shot caller, get up off my collar
You a Chihuahua, I'm a Rottweiler

[Pre-Chorus: will.i.am & Nicki Minaj, will.i.am & Nicki Minaj]
I can't believe it, it's so amazin' (Yeah)

[Intro] 

[ x2 ]
I'm that nigga X3
And I'm clean, that machine
Super cool, super mean

[Verse 1: T.I.]
You already know
I'm the hottest nigga you heard in a long time
Introducing you to the hottest nigga you've heard in a long time

Mega pimp, super clean, the coolest in the universe
Niggas hatin' on what he doin', just mad cause they ain't do it first
His name pop up when you hit "playa" on ya Google search
Bitches bow they heads and bend they knees, just like they do in church
Drop dough into a purse, before you get into a skirt
She agree to do the work, before she get into the purp
'Til my pine box drop down into the dirt
I'mma be by far the hottest nigga known to the earth
In the air I fly can't compare, my swagger to another rapper don't you dare try
Anyone wit a pair of eyes can look and see, no legacy, will ever be, next to me or nothin' near by
Though I invite you all to try, ay, I'mma a fair guy
Just approach with caution, be aware, cause I don't share my...throne
My crown I own, hottest flow on any song I'm on I'm gone nigga!
B.o.B you up next baby
Grand Hustle Niggaaaaa!

If I ain't the hottest nigga on the mutha fuckin universe, I guess I'll just have to do 'til he get here nigga!

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Here I go

I'm that nigga that you heard about through word of mouth
They probably said I change the music in the dirty south
Now that the word is out
The timing is perfect now
To take all these hypocritical rumors and burn em down
If you observe the doubt you would see what they worried bout
They say I sound like Dre when I'm rapping my verses now
Honestly, I could give a fuck what you blurtin' out
Point blank,I'm in the game...rockin' my jersey now
So just accept me or don't pay me no mind
Either way you gonna be hearin' me all of the time
Whether on Greg street, or 107.9
Or on yo favorite rap blog, on yo rap website
And if that ain't right, then show me straight to the judge
Just like Bryan Nichols I ain't spittin', nothin' but slugs
Venomous blood in my veins
Chemicals up in my brain
Yes I resemble a criminal
B.o.Bizzle, you ain't fuckin' wit mane!
Ahhh!

[Outro: T.I.] + (B.o.B)
Okay, you got that (I'm gone, mayne
I kinda, I kinda feel like I got you, man)
Hehehe (I had to kinda show you up, man
I ain't really wanna make you look bad, really, honestly)
Ay, man, aye man that laughing, that laugh is natural
Because I'm literally amused by your sentiment
I mean if you really feel that, know what I'm sayin
That the likes of the second verse can even
Slightly compare with the immaculate (Hahaha)
Then I must take a chuckle...Hahaha
You know what I'm saying, but never no mind
(We can have em blog about it)
Absolutely, man, I'll let you guys be the judge
(You know you gonna do it anyway, fuck it)
B.o.B or T.I.P. Know what I'm saying, you be the judge, dog
(Which could be the better acronym for the song)
But you know what either way it's Grand Hustle!
Hahahaha (Ah-haha)

[Chorus until fade]

[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
LA-SER
Yeah, yeah
Kane is in the building, nigga
Yeah

[Chorus: JR Get Money]
Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, 'til the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up, the show goes on
Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, 'til the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up, the show goes on

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Have you ever had the feelin' that you was bein' had?
Don't that shit there make you mad? They treat you like a slave
Put chains all on your soul and put whips up on your back
They be lyin' through they teeth, hope you slip up off your path
I don't switch up, I just laugh (Ha ha) put my kicks up on they desk
Unaffected by they threats, then get busy on they ass
See that's how that Chi-Town made me
That's how my daddy raised me
That glitterin' may not be gold, don't let nobody play me
If you are my homeboy, you never have to pay me
Gon' and put your hands up, when times is hard, you stand up
L-U-P the man, 'cause the brand that the fans trust
So even if they ban us, they'll never slow my plans up

[Chorus: JR Get Money]
Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, 'til the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up, the show goes on
Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, 'til the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up, the show goes on

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
One in the air for the people ain't here
Two in the air for the father that's there
Three in the air for the kids in the ghetto
Four for the kids that don't wanna be there
None for the niggas tryna hold them back
Five in the air for the teachers not scared
To tell those kids that's livin' in the ghetto
That the niggas holdin' back that the world is theirs
Yeah, yeah, the world is yours, I was once that little boy
Terrified of the world, now I'm on a world tour
I would give up everything, even start a world war
For these ghetto girls and boys I'm rappin' round the world for
Africa to New York, Haiti then I detour
Oakland out to Auckland, Gaza Strip to Detroit
Say hip-hop only destroy, tell 'em look at me, boy
I hope your son don't have a gun and never be a d-boy

[Chorus: JR Get Money]
Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, 'til the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up, the show goes on
Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, 'til the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up, the show goes on

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
So no matter what you been through, no matter what you into
No matter what you see when you look outside your window
Brown grass or green grass, picket fence or barbed wire
Never ever put them down, you just lift your arms higher
Raise 'em 'til your arms tired, let 'em know you here
That you strugglin', survivin', that you gon' persevere
Yeah, ain't nobody leavin', nobody goin' home
Even if they turn the lights out, the show is goin' on, alright

[Chorus: JR Get Money]
Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, 'til the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up, the show goes on
Alright, already, the show goes on
All night, 'til the morning we dream so long
Anybody ever wonder, when they would see the sun up
Just remember when you come up, the show goes on

[Jennifer Hudson]
Guess I gotta forget all about this issue
And try to live my life just like it is
Whooa
But I want everybody to remember me (everybody)
I will come back 10 years ago (well, hey)
Said I want everybody to remember me
When I go back 10 years and years ago
When I get my second chance

[Lupe Fiasco]
When I get my second chance I’m gon' redeem myself
When I bring myself, me and my team my help
Ain't no “I” in that but I’m in that so I am packed
Like there's ten of me inside of that
Ain't one man army, one man army I am that
Bring it back like a typer-writer, writing that
I attack like a lightning strike with a lions wrath
With a vipers bite come alive with that
Put your life on that
Like everything I do though
All my old wounds have all healed but they still feel like they new though
And everytime I see ‘em I start to think of you yo
First I wasn’t focused, wasn’t willing and my goon’s
So performance was just lackin at those moments that were crucial
Now my heart is razor sharp and confidence is MUCHO
Big, things I can’t forgive, things I can't forget
Things I can’t relive, the agony is asking me, defeat is sweet to sin
But I put that on my city we will never meet again

[Hook]
Never miss the city of the wind that I’m in
City of the wind that I’m in
We can do it now
We can do it now
We can do it now
We can do it we can do we can do it now
Second chance, second win, do it again
Yeah eah, eeeeah

Yeah we do it again
We can do it now
Lets do it again
We can do it now
Do it now

[Common]
The rise of the phoenix, sweat falls
Time has its meaning, I evolve
Hit the ground and bounce back up, just like B-Ball
Muhammad Ali jaw, I knew that I would be all
Far from where I came from, the same place that pain's from
My name hung, from the rafters before an aftermath of a master
Wishing I could have the moment to grab the trophy and glass of champagne
My locker rooms a cold place, LA got no gates
You mighta seen this man cry, that was just my old face
My soul waits redemption and intervention from a higher dimension
Inspire mission, no more hoping or wishing, conditions’ll change
Stickers say Barack on the range
I’m from the Chi’ too, now I’m Barack in the game
Came back and overcame, overstood the rain
More than just the fame, married to the game
Now I hold the reign

[Hook]

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Ok, Gucci backpack, fresh black Adidas

Ohh baby, in the world of paper, paper

[Snoop Dogg]
Thinkin of a master plan
Cause ain't nuttin but sweat inside my hand
So I dig into my pockets, all my money is spent
So I dig deeper, but still comin up with lint
So I, start my mission, leave my residence
Thinkin how can I get some dead presidents
I need money, I used to see a stick-up kid
So I think of all the devious things I did
I used to roll up, this is a hold up, ain't nuttin funny
Stop smilin, cause still don't nuttin move but the money
Cause now I've learned to earn cause I'm righteous
I feel great, so maybe I might just
Search fo' a 9 to 5, if I strive
Then maybe I'll stay alive
So I walk up the street, whistlin this
Feelin out of place cause man do I miss
A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of
Me and Warren G, and a big fat plate of
Chicken wings, cause that's my favorite thang
But without no money man that shit's a dream
Cause I don't like to dream about gettin paid
So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I've made
Soon as I bust 'em see if I got pull
I hit the DoggHouse, cause I'm paid in full {*echoes*}

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
She said there was no love in her heart
'Cause one day a rapist attacked her and broke that all apart
She said there was no way to fix it or to cover her scars
Then one day a guy came along that probably could help her start
He was sincere, made her believe it was safe for her to trust again
Before long, she was cool with givin' hugs to him
Knew that it was right 'cause somethin' was wrong
The alarms in her mind didn't tell her he didn't belong
There was no

He said nobody else ever loved him
That's why he get high enough to go touch the heavens above him
Vividly remembers every pipe, every needle that stuck him
Every alley he ever slept in, every purse that he snuck in
Every level of hell he's been to and the one that he's stuck in
The one he can't escape, even though it's of his own construction
Maybe you can relate, maybe you one of those that just doesn't
Maybe he doesn't care, loves to allow these demons to come in
With no

Famine strikin' his homeland and no social standin'
In the economic peckin' order
Emergency relief distribution systems is in disorder
He's checkin' water, makin' sure it's safe enough for his daughter
To float across in the boat he built
Hopefully strong enough to support her
Prayin' border patrols don't catch her ass, process and deport her
Before she reach the shore of the land of the free
Where they feed you, treat you like equals
Deceive you, stamp you and call you illegal, and there's an

There's someone here and it's not me
How could this be? I locked my doors (This be)
Kept my armies on my shore (My shore)
And point my rockets at my sky
I'm so fortified
I built my walls so high (So high)
So why, oh why? (So, why?)
Are there

[Chorus: Lupe Fiasco & Sarah Green]
Intruder, intruder, intruder (Intruder), intruder
Intruder, intruder (Intruder), intruder, intruder
Intruder, intruder, intruder, intruder

All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom
All the girls standing in the—All the girls standing in the—
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom

[Interlude: Pharrell Williams]
Yeah, you know, it's been a minute since, um
We expressed ourselves
It takes a lot of courage to say this, but um
I see sounds

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
You and your girls are going out tonight
Y'all been planning this all week right
You got something boys can't deny
(Here’s a hint) It's like apple pie
Cut you open and you're just wired
You ain’t tired; you wanna cause a riot
Who, who can say no to you?
Wait 'til they get a load of you

[Pre-Hook: Pharrell Williams]
A hundred dollar bills (Look at you, at you)
A hundred dollar bills (Look at you, at you)
A hundred dollar bills (Look at you, at you)
A hundred dollar bills (Look at you, at you)
Because

All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom

All the girls standing in the—All the girls standing in the—
All the girls standing in the line for the bathroom

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
Superstar ask you what you have
Bartender get the drank, we just laugh
"He talking 'bout a autograph"
You just wanna dance in your reckless path
Close your eyes, see colorful things
You wanna, let go, feel wonderful things
Just a, bit more just to get in the lane
So we can enter the brain and you can flip with the pain

[Pre-Hook: Pharrell Williams]
A hundred dollar bills (Look at you, at you)
A hundred dollar bills (Look at you, at you)
A hundred dollar bills (Look at you, at you)
A hundred dollar bills (Look at you, at you)
Because

[Bridge: Pharrell Williams & Shay Haley]
Baby, you partied all night in sixth gear
Just so you know the AC is blowin' over here
Don't worry, I won’t blow your high
Talkin' bout your life and how it is all wrong
Just know if you go outside
And see the sunrise as all the stars are gone
Tell your friends, they can go
You're okay, you’re just chilling with me
Here’s a towel, wipe your face
Cool down, have a drink, it’s on me
Here's a towel (Here's a towel) wipe your face (Wipe your face)
Cool down (Cool down) have a drink, it's on me
Here's a towel (Here's a towel) wipe your face (Wipe your face)
Cool down (Cool down) but you would rather party, cause

[Hook]
Pretty pink, baby blue
Why don't (why don't) you teach me something new
We're all (we're all) just babies in my view
So crawl baby
Crawl baby
Pretty pink, baby blue
Why don't (why don't) you teach me something new
We're all (we're all) just babies in my view
So crawl baby
Crawl baby

[Verse 1]
Miss lady
You could have been born a little later but I don't care
So what if your head sports a couple of grey hairs
Same here, and actually I think that's funky
(In a Claire Huxtable type way)
Miss lady
It looks to me like you need a little juice in your life
So call me when that big ole house gets lonelyfied
And I'll teleport from here to there
You show me how it's supposed to be done
I'll make sure you have young fun

[Hook]
Pretty pink, baby blue
Why don't (why don't) you teach me something new
We're all (we're all) just babies in my view
So crawl baby
Crawl baby
Pretty pink, baby blue
Why don't (why don't) you teach me something new
We're all (we're all) just babies in my view
So crawl baby
Crawl baby

[Verse 2]
You're sophisticated
Just me and miss lady
You've got me talkin like a baby
You make me talk baby talk
She's so sophisticated
You make me talk baby talk
Just me and miss lady
She makes me talk baby talk
Got me talkin like a baby
Like ga ga and goo goo
Oh momma
You're sophisticated
Make me talk baby talk
Just me and miss lady
You're so experienced
Got me talkin like a baby
Teach me somethin new
Teach me somethin new
You're sophisticated
Just me and miss lady
You got me talkin like a baby

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Pussy my passion, never been a fan of flashin'
Probably 'cause I never could, said if I had it, never would
Then I got my first lil taste of paper and I splurged
I guess it's just a nigga urge, this is The Boondocks
I swear, yo, I’m like Huey mixed with Riley
Thursday I be tryna save the world, and then on Friday, I hit the club
Hopin' that my dick get rubbed by some fat asses
Niggas get to scrappin' then you hear the gats blasting, damn
Hope them niggas ain't got no problems with me
My momma told me to speak like you got a college degree
You see, I can, but I won’t 'cause I’m saying what I want
Plus this slang that I speak don't change that I'm deep
As the throat on a certified freak, will she choke?
As we headed to the crib, yes, I let her give me head
So she won't 'member where I live, my game is tight
Baby, no need to bring pajamas, you ain't stayin' the night
No disrespect, I just say it polite
I drop her off before I sleep, I be praying for life
Like Hov said it, can I live?
Ayy, dear Lord, can I live?
Hey, now am I living to get paid, just slaves for a wage, are we?
I can't do no 9-to-5, told my momma sorry
I can't do no suit and tie, no I want the glory
If you knew me, know my life is like a movie starring me
Pardon me, if it seems that I'm following my dreams
I ain't reading off the script that they picked for me
I ain't pissed, nah, couldn’t give a shit hardly
I'll be shitting on them niggas that was shitting on me
Will I live or will I die before they get to know me?
If I go, I know the ones that’s pouring liquor for me
And I know them fake niggas really hating on me
Knew that I was 'bout to blow, so they was waiting on me

[Bridge]
But oh no, Lord
You see, I'm smarter than they know
So hold on, Lord, 'cause I ain't quite ready to go
Can I live?
Somebody told me that it's only one shot
So I'll be goddamned if I'm ever gonna stop
Promise to my momma I'ma make it to the top
So I'ma keep climbing 'til my heartbeat drop

[Verse 2]
Like the phone when she heard the news
Her sister on the other line talking to her shoes
The only son, what a thing to lose
More blacks singing more blues
More niggas pouring more brews
Poor dude, he was young like 21, straight up out that city that I'm from
A real smart nigga, but his niggas, they was dumb
He ain't even get a chance to run
Before it landed in his lung
God, breathe nigga
His partner screaming “Don’t you fucking leave, nigga!”
Took off his shirt, tryna stop the bleeding nigga, “Don’t you go!”
But his life fading slow
Did I tell my mom I love her, do she know?
Did I tell my baby sorry from before?
Won't get to see my son grow
Lord, I ain't ready to go
Can I live? Can I live? Dear Lord, Can I live?
Can I live?

[Intro: 2-D]
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo

[Chorus: 2-D]
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

[Verse 1: Del the Funky Homosapien]
(Hoo, yeah, haha)
Finally, someone let me out of my cage
Now, time for me is nothing, 'cause I'm countin' no age
Nah, I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs, and I'm under each snare
Intangible, bet you didn't think, so I command you to
Panoramic view, look, I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose, sit and lose, all you different crews
Chicks and dudes, who you think is really kickin' tunes?
Picture you getting down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse, you think it's fictional?
Mystical? Maybe, spiritual hero
Who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy?
Lifeless to those, the definition for what life is
Priceless to you, because I put you on the hype shit
You like it? Gun smokin', righteous with one toke
Get psychic among those, possess you with one dose

[Chorus: 2-D & (Del the Funky Homosapien)]
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on (That's right)
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

[Verse 2: Del the Funky Homosapien]
The essence, the basics, without it, you make it
Allow me to make this childlike in nature
Rhythm, you have it or you don't, that's a fallacy
I'm in them, every sproutin' tree, every child of peace
Every cloud and sea, you see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise, corruption in disguise (That's right)
From this fuckin' enterprise, now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles
But percussion he provides for me as a guide, y'all can see me now
'Cause you don't see with your eye, you perceive with your mind
That's the inner (Fuck 'em) so I'ma stick around with Russ and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember
Where the thought is, I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless (Right here)
Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing and remember that it's all in your head

[Chorus: 2-D]
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless, but not for long
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on

[Outro: 2-D]
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future is coming on
It's coming on, it's coming on
My future

[Intro: Kanye West]
She really thought that? (Yeah)
Yeah, she's so paranoid (Yeah, that's good, paranoid)
Girls gonna love this song, ahaha
Why are you so paranoid? (Aha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
Don't be so paranoid, don't be so

[Refrain: Kanye West]
Baby, don't worry 'bout it
Hey there, don't even think about it
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Tell me right now
You really wanna spend your whole life alone?
A little time out might do you good
Might do us good 'fore we be done for good
'Cause I could make it good, I could make it hood
I could make you come, I could make you go
I could make you high, I can make you fly
Make you touch the sky, hey, maybe so
All of the time
You be up in mine checkin' through my cell phone, baby, no
You wanna kill the vibe on another night
Here's another fight, oh, here we go (Oh, here we go)

[Chorus: Kanye West, Mr. Hudson & Kid Cudi]
Baby, don't worry about it
Lady, we'll go out to the floor
Anyway, they don't know you (They don't know) like I do
They'll never know you (Never know)
Anyway, they don't know you (Never know) like I do
They'll never know you

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
All of the time
You wanna complain about the nights alone
So now you're here with me, show some gratitude
Leave the attitude way back at home
Yeah, you see 'em look
Baby, let 'em look, give ya cold looks 'cause we look cold
Yeah, you heard about all the word of mouth
Don't worry about what we can't control
All the talk in the world lost in the world
'Til you finally let that thing go
You wanna check into the heartbreak hotel
But sorry, we're closed

[Chorus: Kanye West, Mr. Hudson & Kid Cudi]
Baby, don't worry about it
Baby, we'll go out to the floor
Anyway (Hey) they don't know you (To the floor) like I do (Hey)
They'll never know you (Never know)
Anyway, they don't know you (They don't know) like I do
They'll never know you

[Refrain: Kanye West]
Baby, don't worry about it
Lady, don't even think about it
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry 'bout the wrong things, the wrong things

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson & Kid Cudi]
Anyway, they don't know you like I do
They'll never know you
Anyway, they don't know you like I do
They'll never know you
Anyway, they don't know you like I do
They'll never know you
Anyway, they don't know you like I do

[Intro]
Ahem
Hey
Coming to you from a packed studio
(Haha) Haha, uh

[Verse]
I'm goin' in after hittin' this ganja
Out to dinner with the homies, private table at Nakama
I'm a new millennium Sinatra
Coppin' marijuana from the neighborhood Rastas
Chiefin', feastin', king of the new school
I'm speakin' in tongues, try translatin' voodoo
Hold up, let me start again
Undefeated shirt, Levi's and a Mr Rogers cardigan
It's a hell of a feelin' bein' this fresh
Spit seem to sit upon my lips, call it Blistex
Peddlin' this medical, the presence of a general
Magazine centerfolds, they all up on my genitals
Got the game in the palm of my hand, it's itchin'
Wylin' out, better talk to your man, he bitchin'
'Cause I ain't got a lot time for these weirdos
Talkin' shit all up in my earlobes
I just live life, try and do it right
Everyone that hear me say "The boy is super nice"
Put a bitch up on a flight, she gon' be here by tonight
Get some afternoon delight, only eat it if it's ripe
Call me Stanley Steemer, I be givin' her the pipe
And when I'm outta town she wanna see me so we Skype
She might get obsessed and keep callin'
Thirty-thousand feet, Tom Petty, free fallin'
Just layin' back, lettin' gravity take its course
I wanna tell all of my haters that we made it, boy
From basement studios to some official shit
From stressed out all the time to I don't give a shit
Used to dream about it, boy, now I'm livin' it
412, it's the Most Dope syndicate
Had a normal life but now I'm sick of it
Try and spend money just to spend and it's ridiculous
Young and so mischievous

[Outro]
Bitches-es
And then, uh, Rell wants me to sing a hook like this:
A-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la
La-la-la, la-la
A-na-na
A-na-na
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la

Sir Lucious gots gator belts and patty melts and Monte Carlos
And El Dorados; so I'm waking up out of my slumber feeling like Rollo
So follow, it's Showtime at the Apollo minus the Kiki Shepards
What about a ho in a leopard-print? Ah
Teddy Pendergrass, cooler than Freddie Jackson
Sipping a milkshake in a snowstorm
Left her throat warm in the dorm room at the A.U
We blew hay too, athletes might cake you
But you must have me mistaken with them statements that you make 'cause

So a nigga can ride out to the Honeycomb Hideout
I'mma show you how to wild out like Jack Tripper
Let me be bambino on your snipples
YKK on your zipper, lick you like a lizard when I'm slizzard
Or sober, six million ways to fold ya

But I'll call yo' ass 'round eight-ish, I know you'll be there for me, girl

Those huge baby eyes, get to runnin' off at they mouth
And tellin' me everything that's on your nasty mind
They say you're malnutritioned, in need of vitamin D
And invitin' me to that tingle in your spine
I love who you are, I love who you ain't — you're so Anne Frank
Let's hit the attic to hide out for 'bout two weeks
Rick James'n, no chains and whips
I do suck lips 'til hips jerk in double time
The boy next door's a freak, ha-ha!

Re—Re—Reporting from another world
Look up in the sky and see me courting with a cover girl
She know that it's "bye" after I'm through then it's another girl
I can make your wife and your sister fuck your brother girl
Rockstar biatch, check out how we rock
And if this ain't hip-hop, it must be knee-hop
I'm higher than a motherfucking chronic leaf treetop
I make that Nina sing like, "Shooty-do-dee-wop"
You want the facts, Daddy? Well I truly do me, Pop
And I get my candy from your girlfriend's sweet shop
Still get a stomachache every time I see cops
You better run motherfucker, 'cause we not
Yeah, you bitches better run 'til your feet stop
And I'm so fed up with street cops
I'm colder than a ski shop, I'm holding onto the top
And even if I let go, I still won't d-rop

[Refrain]
I am the rhyming Oasis
I got a cup of your time, I won't waste it
I got my foot on the line, I'm not racing
I thank God that I am not basic

Hahaha! Rockstar, baby
Now come to my suite and get lockjaw, baby
I can knock your boots and your socks off, baby
Newsflash: your boyfriend a knockoff, baby
Okay, real shit: you can get knocked off, baby
And I'm like a champagne top, I'm ready to pop off, baby
You really lucky I don't kill if it's not for Baby
Got so much money, I can look at the cops all crazy
R—Rockstar shit for my rockstar ass
Got a tub full of money, that's a rockstar bath
Then I use more money to wipe my rockstar ass
Then I throw it in the garbage, that's rockstar trash
I—I wouldn't try you, I wouldn't lie, dude
I must be sticky cause them bitches got they eyes glued
Big B, bitch, I'm so motherfucking Damu
Staring at a mountain like, "Bitch, I will climb you"
I stand tall like I'm motherfucking 9'2"
I scream, "Motherfuck you and whoever designed you"
And if you think you hot, then obviously, you are lied to
And we don't die, we multiply, and then, we come divide you

I'm rockstar bad
With my rockstar glasses and my rockstar plaid
This the School of Hard Rock, I'm a rockstar grad
And my kids are proud to have a rockstar dad
Now, mama, let them titties bounce like rocks off glass
And if you do, I'll probably call you like shots off glass
Don't jump into my water 'cause you not gon' last
I swear I'ma be like a shark that's locked on bass
R—Rockstar life, rockstar bright
And in the mosh pit is how a rockstar fight
So jump up in this bitch and catch a rockstar right
And the cops could never violate a rockstar's rights
Yeah, now, I'm back on my grizz
And y'all's a bunch of squares like a motherfucking grid
And everybody get it, well, me, I get rid
Of he who say he get it, and then, I get his
No marquee, but this is big biz
And I scream, "Fuck it, whoever 'it' is!"
Ain't no motherfucker deeper than me, bitch, dig!
And I thank God everyday that my children are rich kids

[Chorus: Curtis Mayfield, Pete Rock & Charlie Wilson]
Add a little sugar (Ow), honeysuckle and (Woo)
A great big expression of happiness
Boy, you couldn't miss (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
With a dozen roses (Ayy, uh, Mr. West)
Such would astound you (Pete Rock)
The joy of children laughing around you (Uh)
These are all the makings of you (Woo)

[Verse 1: Kanye West & Pete Rock]
I do it for the forefathers, yeah, the street authors
That are now A&Rs in the cheap office
Rappers that never got signed, but they keep offers
Girls that's way too fine for us to keep off us
Gave her a handshake only for my man's sake
She in her birthday suit 'cause of the damn cake
Now it's crumbs all over the damn place (Uh-huh)
And she want me to cum all over her damn face
I never understood Planned Parenthood
'Cause I never met nobody planned to be a parent in the hood
Taking refills of that Plan B pill
Another shorty that won't make it to the family will
If I don't make it, can't take it, hope the family will
They ain't crazy, they don't know how insanity feel
Don C. just had a shorty, so it's not that bad
But I still hear the ghosts of the kids I never had

[Chorus: Curtis Mayfield, Pete Rock & Charlie Wilson]
Add a little sugar (Woo), honeysuckle and (Come on)
A great big expression of happiness (Ow)
Boy, you couldn't miss (Uh-huh, uh)
With a dozen roses (Ayy, uh, Kanye)
Such would astound you (Pete Rock)
The joy of children laughing around you (Uh)
These are all the makings of you (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
No electro, no metro
A little retro, ah, perfecto
You know the demo, your boy act wild
You ain't get the memo? Yeezy's back in style
Now one room got Gidget, the other got Bridget
What's more tripped out, dawg, is they sisters
Nah, you ain't listen, they Black, they sisters
They mama named 'em after white bitches
So next time you see me on your fallopian
Though the jewelry's Egyptian, know the hunger's Ethiopian
Stupid questions like, "Is he gon' be dope again?
Have you seen him? Has anybody spoke to him?"
This beat deserves Hennessy
A bad bitch, and a bag of weed, the Holy Trinity
In the mirror where I see my only enemy
Your life's cursed? Well, mine's an obscenity

[Chorus: Curtis Mayfield, Pete Rock, Charlie Wilson & Jay-Z]
Add a little sugar (Woo), honeysuckle and (Come on, red lights)
A great big expression of happiness (Ow)
Boy, you couldn't miss (Let that thing roll, uh-huh, uh)
With a dozen roses (Ayy, uh, Kanye)
Such would astound you (Pete Rock, uh)
The joy of children laughing around you (Uh)
These are all the makings of you (Yeah, ow)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z & Pete Rock]
This is my mama's shit
I used to hear this through the walls in the hood when I was back on my pajama shit (Uh-huh)
Afros and marijuana sticks (Woo)
Seeds in the ganja had it poppin' like the sample that I'm rhymin' with
Pete Rock (Uh), let the needle drop
I seen so much as a kid, they surprised I don't needle pop (Uh-huh)
Takin' sips of Pop's six-pack of Miller nips
Pink Champale, Ballantine Ale
Ballys on my feet help me balance out well (Woo)
That and the shit I used to balance on the scale
I got it honest from the parties from my mama's
Virgin Marys tried to judge her, I'm like, "Where are them Madonnas now?"
Give all glory to Gloria (One-two, okay)
They said you raised that boy too fast
But you was raising a warrior
We victorious, they'll never take the joy from us, uh (One-two, okay)

[Outro: Kid Cudi & Pete Rock]
Keep your hands up, get 'em high now (It's Pete Rock, Kanye)
Don't let them take your fire
Keep your hands up, get 'em high now (One-two, okay)
Don't let them take your fire
Keep your hands up, get 'em high now (It's Pete Rock, Kanye)
Don't let them take your fire
Keep your hands up, get 'em high now, yeah (One-two, okay)
It's Pete Rock, Kanye
One-two, okay
It's Pete Rock, Kanye
One-two, okay
It's Pete Rock, Kanye
One-two, okay
It's Pete Rock, Kanye
One-two, okay

[Intro: Lupe Fiasco (sampled)]
Now, lil' Terry got a gun he got from the store
He bought it with the money he got from his chores
He robbed the candy shop, told her "Lay down on the floor
Put the cookies in the bag, take the pennies out the drawer"
Lil' Khalil got a gun he got from the rebels
To kill the infidels and American devils
A bomb on his waist, a mask on his face
Prays five times a day and listens to heavy metal
Little Alex got a gun he took from his dad
That he snuck into school in his black book bag
His black nail polish, black boots, and black hat
He gon' blow away the bully that just pushed his ass

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
I killed another man today
Shot him in his back as he ran away
Then, I blew up his hut with a hand grenade
Cut his wife throat as she put her hands to pray
Just five more dogs; then, we can get a soccer ball
That's what my commander say
How old? Well, I'm like ten, eleven
Been fighting since I was like six or seven
Now, I don't know much about where I'm from
But I know I strike fear everywhere I come
Government want me dead, so I wear my gun
I really want the rocket launcher, but I'm still too young
This candy give me courage not to fear no one
To feel no pain and hear no tongue
So I hear no screams, and I shed no tear
If I'm in your dreams, then your end is near, yeah!

[Chorus: Nikki Jean]
Little weapon, little weapon, little weapon
We're calling you
Little boy, if the guns are just too tall for you
We'll find you something small to use
Little weapon, little weapon, little weapon
We need you now, blaow!

[Bridge: Lupe Fiasco]
Astaghfirullah
Astaghfirullah
Astaghfirullah
Astaghfirullah
Astaghfirullah

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Now, here comes the march of the boy brigade
A macabre parade of the toys he made
In shemaghs and shades, who look half his age
About half the size of the flags they wave
And camouflage suits made to fit youths
'Cause the ones off the dead soldiers hang a lil' loose
Where AK47s that they shooting into heaven
Like they tryna kill a Jetson, the struggles, little recruits
Cute, smileless, heartless, violent
Childhood destroyed, devoid of all childish ways
Can't write their own names
Or read the words that's on they own graves
Think you gangsta? Popped a few rounds?
These kids'll come through and murder a whole town
Then sit back and smoke and watch it burn down
The grave gets deeper the further we go down, it's...

[Chorus: Nikki Jean]
Little weapon, little weapon, little weapon
We're calling you
Little boy, if the guns are just too tall for you
We'll find you something small to use
Little weapon, little weapon, little weapon
We need you now, blaow!

[Verse 3: Bishop G]
Imagine if I had to console
The families of those slain I slayed on game consoles
I aim, I hold right trigger to squeeze
Press up and Y, one less nigga breathe
B for the bombs, press pause for your moms
Make the room silent, she don't approve of violent games
She leave; resume activity
Scarred and blue heart, of hard, sharp wizardry
On next part, I insert code
To sweeten up the little person's murder workload
I tell him he work for CIA with A
A operative; I operate this game all day
I hold the controller connected to the soldier
With weapons on his shoulder
He's only seconds older than me
We playful but serious
Now, keep that on mind for online experience, ugh!

[Chorus: Nikki Jean]
Little weapon, little weapon, little weapon
We're calling you
Little boy, if the guns are just too tall for you
We'll find you something small to use
Little weapon, little weapon, little weapon
We need you now
Little weapon, little weapon, little weapon
We're calling you
Little boy, if the guns are just too tall for you
We'll find you something small to use
Little weapon, little weapon, little weapon
We need you now, blaow!

[Intro: Ludacris]
I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Now this is what they call poetry in motion
My soul bleeds on the paper, heart screams with emotion
It's my daily devotion, the verses stay deeper than the ocean
So hip-hop you owe me a promotion!
Yeah I do a little boastin and braggin
What's all the commotion and naggin about? Cause I'm still the champ in the South?
Cause rappers get in the booth and I keep draggin em out?
Well they're fired, and these pink slips, I'm handin em out
Cause this is "Theater of the Mind," consider it a sign
Of what's to come next, my money's just fine
Bank filled with dumb checks, terrorist threat flow
Proceed to drop bombs like Mr. Funk Flex
But I don't do it for the money, I do it from the heart
I do it with the beat box, I did it from the start
I do it for the dee jays, I do it for the charts
The Van Gogh flow, Luda do it cause it's art
I do it for the fans, I do it on command
I do it for the front row, I do it for the stands
I spit it for the hood, I do it for the block
And since nine years old I did it for hip-hop, so

[Chorus 1: Ludacris]
I don't do it for them cars and the fancy drops
I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop
And I don't it for the chains and the flashin rocks
I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop

[Verse 2: Nas]
Uhh, uhh, uh
They say I'm so low key, I'm socially awkward
Only niggas who really know me, who I talk with
They smile in the light, hate in the dark
You call it beef, to me, it's just a fuckin walk in the park
Cause you are who you are when nobody's lookin
That's who you are, so when the cash and the cars is gone
The day after tomorrow, don't be askin to borrow
Ski mask it hard, like the way you rap in your bars
I can ride on you and whoever, devise new endeavors
I'm as live as a hive full of predators
Twenty thousand different species of bees
Some have poisonous stings, some just pollinate leaves
It's like rap, some just buzz, some will attack
Compromise their own life in fact
Sixteen years since my first sixteen
Pardon the rest of my niggas... but I'm the best who's ever did it!

[Chorus 2: Ludacris, Nas, Ludacris & Nas]
I don’t do for the cars and the fancy drops
Uh, I do it for hip-hop
Yeah, I do it for hip-hop
Uh, I do it for hip-hop
And I don’t do for the chains and the flashin’ rocks
Why we do it kid? I do it for hip-hop
Yeah, I do it for hip-hop
Uh, I do it for hip-hop

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Hip-hop, started out in the park
We used to do it to avoid the Narcs
I used to do it so the homeboy Clark
Can get the fuck off my back while I knocked off these packs
I used to rap to impress my friends
To pass the time while I was gettin' it in
Just so happens, I'm so illegal with the pen
They ain't want me doin' anything illegal again
I lost a lot of dogs to these streets
I got Grammy Awards on these beats
Thank God for Kool Herc
Without your shit I probably would've got murked
Shout out to Grandmaster Flash and to Caz
And even Jaz bum-ass
Hip-hop helped me wash my rocks
These other rappers couldn't wash my socks
That's why I took the number one slot
The realest shit in rap comes from my voice box
Lord knows when I was on my clock
I prolly never woulda stopped, thank God for hip-hop

[Chorus 3: Ludacris, Jay-Z, Ludacris, Nas & Jay-Z]
I don’t do for the cars and the fancy drops
Uh, I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop
And I don’t do for the chains and the flashin’ rocks
Come on, I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop

{*DJ scratches and Ludacris ad-libs until 4:56*}

[Chorus 1: Ludacris]
I don't do it for them cars and the fancy drops
I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop
And I don't it for the chains and the flashin rocks
I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
I’m coming home
I’m coming home
Tell the World I’m coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they’ve forgiven my mistakes
I’m coming home, I’m coming home
Tell the world I’m coming

[Bridge: J. Cole]
Back where I belong
I’ve never felt so strong eh
Feeling like there’s nothing that I can’t try
And if you feel me put your hands high, high, high, hey
And if you feel me put your hands high, high, hey

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
This is my story, this is my song
If you ain't got the heart, don’t attempt to try this at home
It’s just a poem from a man once living wrong
Now I’m in the zone, tell the world I’m coming home
Been a long time coming, been a long time coming
This song feel like the greatest of all time coming
Cause I do it B-I-G, I remember we would be high
Who’d have thought we’d be running rap when we was knee high
To appreciate the sun you gotta know what rain is
Or cause I’m famous you don’t think I know what pain is
But I bounce back, would ya look at that
I take my spot at the top and I ain't looking back

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
I’m coming home
I’m coming home
Tell the World I’m coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they’ve forgiven my mistakes
I’m coming home, I’m coming home
Tell the world I’m coming

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Hey, confusion like I was losing my mind
But one thing I never lose is my grind
My closet need a lot of cleaning now
I can’t sleep cause I dont like the shit I dream about
Hey Dear Lord please help me get the demons out
And then let me get my genius out
And get back to what I had
If my good’s outweigh my bads, do you think my mistakes is gon even out (even out)
I guess try and see, it’s on my diary, I’m living for my kids
Now they is just as fly as me
Talk well, wonder if Andre Harrell knew how great I would be when he fired me

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
I’m coming home
I’m coming home
Tell the World I’m coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they’ve forgiven my mistakes
I’m coming home, I’m coming home
Tell the world I’m coming
I’m coming home
I’m coming home
Tell the World I’m coming home
Let the rain wash away all the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits and they’ve forgiven my mistakes
I’m coming home, I’m coming home
Tell the world I’m coming

[Pre-Chorus]
Where my ladies at?
I said where my ladies at?
Let's find somewhere we can go crazy at
And for you baby I'll be your maniac
Hey, hey, hey, hey
And you don't have to worry 'bout nothing
Cause every time I see you baby you'll be rolling with me
Oh I'll be on the sidelines rooting for my dime
Holding up my sign and it say:

[Chorus]
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)

Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)

[Verse 1]
There my lady at
I said there my lady at
That's my honey if I give her money she ain't gotta pay me back
No you ain't gotta pay me back
Hey hey hey hey
And I'll forever give you my love cuz
When I'm down you always put a smile on me
And when all of my strength's up, and I'm 'bout to give up
And I need a lift up, I hear her say

[Chorus]
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)

Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)

[Verse 2]
She loves me, she loves me more
Amour me, she assures
She adores me
Even when it's up and down like see-saw
Surely, we can start from scratch like default
When they say you're not my baby like Maury
You can tell 'em that they're telling a story
Testify like you're telling a jury
And I'll repeat like you said it before me
We undefeated like a veteran army
And we as heavy as an elephant, aren't we?
Let's take 'em to the zoo, or better yet a safari
They want me to leave my Dame like the fella from Marcy (No!)
But we go way back like a set of Atari's
From baby fat 'til we skeletons darling
"Me" starring "You" is what it says on the marquee
So let's go give them a show, on my heart, get set, go!

[Chorus]
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)

[Bridge]
And you're my sure-fire, superstar, sure-shot, firecracker
Extravaganza, fantastic, super-size with extra cheese
You best believe
That you're my sure-fire, superstar, sure-shot, firecracker
Extravaganza, fantastic, super-size with extra cheese
Yes indeed!

[Pre-Chorus]
Where my ladies at?
I said where my ladies at?
Let's find somewhere we can go crazy at
And for you baby I'll be your maniac
Hey hey hey hey
And you don't have to worry 'bout nothing
Cause every time I see you baby you'll be rolling with me
Oh I'll be on the sidelines rooting for my dime
Holding up my sign and it say

[Chorus]
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)

[Hook - B.o.B]
Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm lost
They gave me nothing but doubt
First they waited then hated then counted me out
Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm stuck
They say I lost my way
But first I showed em then I sold em right in front of their face

[Verse 1 - B.o.B]
Well this is the world that we live in
One minute you the hero the next you the villain
We got up in this game just to try to make a living
We hit you with the truth while you watching television
But still these are the cards that we dealt
They kick you on the ground when you most need help
Until you dried up and they sit you on the shelf
Then you start to cry because you all by yourself
So just know if you wanna wear the belt
The only way to excel is the soul that you sell
So I could care less about the clothes on myself
Im trying to drive straight on a road made of nails
Yeah, I got to pay the toll if I fail
Or else it would be another story to tell
Im getting to the door I can tell
Im just waiting on the day till the glory prevails

[Hook - B.o.B]
Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm lost
They gave me nothing but doubt
First they waited then hated then counted me out
Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm stuck
They say I lost my way
But first I showed em then I sold em right in front of their face

[Verse 2 - T.I.]
All I know is keep goin', shit don't stop
Until the hustle doubles up, I'll put the click on top
Used to wanna have the bricks on lock
Til we went to prison saw we couldn't pick them locks
Easy decision now a nigga think I lost my touch
Listen if I ain't the realest ever done it I ain't off by much
So please don't wake me up if I'm dreamin'
In the fast lane speedin', no safety belt
And it's a marathon, pace yourself
In this race for wealth talkin shit just a waste of breath
Chasing me like chasing your tail your never catch it
Respect is something you never get if you never had it
I'm lookin' back and laughin' this life of mine
Brought me all the way here from my life of crime
Just a constant reminder that the end all be all
Is the one who knows all sees all because

[Hook - B.o.B]
Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm lost
They gave me nothing but doubt
First they waited then hated then counted me out
Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm stuck
They say I lost my way
But first I showed em then I sold em right in front of their face

[Verse 3 - B.o.B]
Yeah, well these are my predictions
I'll be on the Top 40 with a big hit
Travelin' the world tryin' not to get sick
And I'mma get more friends on my "Friends List"
And then after that I'll be famous
And everyone I know will tell me that I'm changin'
And then my cell phone will never stop ringin'
And I'll be all over magazine pages
Yeah and they'll play my songs 'til they borin'
And if I ever do stop touring they treat me like a foreigner
Don't believe me, ask Lauryn

[Hook - B.o.B]
Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm lost
They gave me nothing but doubt
First they waited then hated then counted me out
Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm stuck
They say I lost my way
But first I showed em then I sold em right in front of their face

[Intro]
Yeah, The Warm Up
Lemme stretch out
Yeah

[Verse 1]
They say I'm the down south Nas, the east coast Pac
The Carolina Andre, the Fayettenam Kanye
So join it, can't beat it, to all the nonbelievers
If you missed it, I'll repeat it, I'm the light skinned Jesus
Here's my thesis for them niggas with them pieces like Reese's
We ballin' while we winking at your bitch up in the bleachers
She fiending just to hop up on my shit like she was featured
On that piece of shit, bed keep on squeaking like some sneakers
On the court, here's some lines you can snort, food for thought
Here's a fork, no pork, damn it, keep it pure, organic
What's the score? Lord, it's a blowout
You niggas out here shoutin', but see me, I'm just gon' show out
Bitch, it's destiny, no doubt, niggas testing me more but I'm sure
Look homie I know my shit can give a tour of the sewer
I'm bored, this shit is simple, on instrumentals I'm Kimbo
Slicing on any tempo, I'm busting like many pimples on the temple
Go hard like I just seen some nipples on Beyonce
No disrespect to Hov, but if I didn't I'd be beyond gay
Almost erased them lines but in the end I chose to keep 'em
'Cause if I said it, I really, I really
I really mean it, yeah

[Interlude]
And that's just a Warm Up baby
Lemme give it to 'em
Yeah, yeah, yeah, look, nigga

[Verse 2]
I rep my city in your city
Just to let you niggas know just where I'm comin from
Ville' nigga troublesome
Gats all around niggas waist like a cummerbund
Leave you leakin' 'til the plumber come
Still we ain't running from no man
Look bitch I'm hot enough to melt a snowman
Ey pack your bags mama we gettin the fuck up outta Po' land
Cause I'm programmed for the dough
While you hold hands with a ho
You ain't got no chance when I flow
Bitch I was a grown man when I was four
Boy, so sit your ass down
You lookin at the class clown
Slash valedictorian, slash hoopin nigga best dressed
Back in school you was just a stupid nigga
And now you're rappin all you talk bout your Coupe is sicker
Your top is dropped but the cops is out here shootin niggas
Stupid nigga, see me I rather tell the truth to niggas
You out here stuntin, niggas is out here frontin
Nigga you good for nothin
I'm freestylin coming off the dome
Bitch Macaulay Culkin Home Alone
I don't even know why I said that
And bitch I get bread that's enormous
Ya'll niggas on my dick man I'm dormant
That means I'm on the low, that means I'm on your ho
That means I'm about this dough
Nigga I'm coming off the dome
Bitch I'm I'll all the way to the chromosomes in my body
Bitch get hit with a 12-gauge shotty
No Maserati, driving like Mr Cosby
Nigga know
I'm coming through I got the sicker flow
I've hit them motherfuckin niggas with that
Nigga know that drunk shit I'll shit
Comin through I spill shit like whoops, bitch
You need to read a book bitch
(Fade Out with J. Cole still rapping)

[Sample: The Education of Sonny Carson]
You know you got this fantasy in your head about getting out of the life and setting that other world on it's ear. What the fuck are you gonna do except hustle? Now, man, I ain't puttin' you down
I'm just tryna make it real, baby, like it is— like it is—

[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
Lupe Fiasco
Came from the ghetto
You know!
Food & Liquor!
It's the ghetto right here, man!

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Ayy, it's real here (Uh-huh), dope fiends steal here
Turn around, give us the money to buy wheels here
Give you the chills, yeah? Developers don't build here
The property values low 'cause we still here
Better believe most of us wanna leave
Furthest we went was out of our minds, but we still here
Weapons concealed here, lil' sisters on the pill here
Can't pay bills here, but we like to chill here (Yeah)
Gotta reap what you sow, grow what you till here
Your momma weep where you sowed, ‘cause you was killed there
Police put cameras on poles, too many deals there
Gotta go to the county 'cause you was filmed there (Yup)
How does it feel knowing innocence was killed here?
Last night, down the park, beating heart was still there
For loveliest chain, I make up pills here
Let's pray for our brains, bust-downs kneel here
Church, yeah

[Hook: Anthony Hamilton]
Sometimes I get rushed
Coming from where I'm from, (I'm from)
Times have got hard, yeah (Y'know?)
Coming from where I'm from (I'm from)
Sometimes I gotta walk to work, yeah (Tales of a young Black male)
Coming from where I'm from (I'm from)
Sometimes I gotta do a little dirt
Coming from where I'm from (I'm from)

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
There was once a child in here
'Cause all the tribulations and the trials in here (Yeah)
And all the limitations of his housing there
Became a teenage trafficker, a thousand-aire
Captivated with what the drug dealer told
Infatuated with what the drug dealers drove
A life validated by what a drug dealer holds
On the stand 'cause what another drug dealer told
A drug dealer woes: "Time waits for no man"
No woman waits for a man with time on his hands (They don't)
Didn't you know? Lord, they fearing Ye now
They hearing Ye now, 'specially when the "Conspiracy"s come down
We come down, get humble; it's no longer fun now
But who gonna hustle to feed his son now?
From the cradle to the cage
We bring our sons to get gunned down
Our daughters to have more
It's war

[Hook: Anthony Hamilton]
Sometimes I get lonely (Yuh)
Coming from where I'm from (I'm from)
Things ain't what they seem to be (Or a reasonable facsimile of it)
Coming from where I'm from (I'm from)
Sometimes I get a little angry (Just ain't me, though)
Coming from where I'm from (I'm from)
Sometimes it gets the best of me (It's all us, man)

[Bridge: Anthony Hamilton]
Well I tried to be good
Wanted nothing but to love somebody
Didn't wanna die young
Grinding, hustling, tryna feed my family
Too scared to have kids
And do what Daddy did
'Cause I'm so scared of failing
Sometimes it gets hard
Coming from where I'm from (Sometimes)

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
But, but it's beautiful here
There's nothing like the feeling when you do it from here
You ain't have to move a pack, you ain't have to shoot a gat
And you still took your mama, and you moved her from here
You ain't dropped out, and you figured the world out
Can survive 'bout anywhere—learn how to do it in here
Yeah, that's how we do it in here
Hearing shorties at play is like music to the ear
We still get by, you know?

[Hook: Anthony Hamilton]
Coming from where I'm from (I'm from)
Sometimes you gotta mourn
Coming from where I'm from (I'm' from)
Sometimes I gotta cry a little bit louder
Coming from where I'm from (I'm from)
Sometimes I gotta fight the pain, yeah
Coming from where I'm from (I'm from)
Sometimes I gotta walk along
Coming from where I'm from (I'm from)
Sometimes I get a little worried
Coming from where I'm from (I'm from)
Sometimes I get lost, out of touch
Coming from where I'm from (I'm from)
Sometimes I think I pray a little bit too much
Coming from where I'm from (I'm from)
Sometimes I get a little scared
Coming from where I'm from (I'm from)

[Intro]
(I, I wanna grow up too)
"Uncle Marshall, will you tell us a bedtime story?"
Here we go!

[Verse 1]
Now, once upon a time not long ago
There was a little rapper about to blow
But his album came, and it was not good
I think it went lead or double copper-wood
So these silly little fans, they were misled
By a nerdy Internet computer hip-hop head
"Me and you, Clef, we're gonna make some cash."
"Grab this silver paint and just paint my ass."
Hey, mister, would you care to bear witness to
The ass-whippin' I'm about to administer
To this ass-kissin' little vaginal blister?
Stanibus, little Marshall Mathers' sister
And in this corner, we have the "Mr
Not-Havin'-It," it's the Mad, sinister
Dr. Evil, with his bag of tricks for
This little antagonistic faggot
Dick-sucking ex-LL Cool J fan from Windsor
I'm 'bout to murder little Kenny-Fag-Kaniff-sta
You bastard, I ain't wanna have to diss ya
Canibus, where the fuck you at? I miss ya!

[Hook]
Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Wherefore art thou, Canibitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York, or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh, Canibitch

[Verse 2]
Now, at first, I ain't really understand this shit
Picture me, for a second, and imagine it
Chillin' in the Bat Mansion relaxin' when
All of a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners, it's
Canibitch, on some 'Stan Lives' shit
It creeped me out at first; man, this is sick
But me, bein' just as sick, this conflict
Gets my dick harder than arithmetic
And I know how you jealous ones envy
I shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me
The first two letters, you were tellin' me shit like
You respect me, like any other regular MC
The third letter, you asked how come I ain't return
None of the messages at Shady Records you left me
The fourth letter: "Slim, you're really startin' to upset me."
The fifth letter told me you were comin' to get me
The sixth letter, there's a bomb threat on our building
This crazy motherfucker's really tryna kill me
So I went back and read the first few letters that said
Some shit about a message you left
Oh shit! That's not a E, that's an A!
This dude wants to leave me a 'massage,' he's gay!
Right away, I'm on the phone with Dr. Dre
"We got a bogey," "Marshall, I'm on the way."

[Hook]
Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Wherefore art thou, Canibitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York, or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh, Canibitch

[Verse 3]
So, in two seconds flat, Dre's at my crib
Only thing is, we both know where this kid lives
And neither one of us have Canadian citizenship
"Shit. Oh, Dre, wait a minute, that's it!
All we gotta do is use a bit of turbo-boost
We can fly over the border!" "Let's Go!" 

[whoosh]
So we're off to Toronto and we're gainin' speed
"What was that? Oh, Jermaine Dupri."
"Fuck it," keep goin', no time to waste
"Wait, back up. Hit him one more time, in case."
"Okay," fuck, now he's draggin' under the car
"Oh well, only thirty more thousand miles!"
Meanwhile, me and Dre are tryna conversate
Just tryna find a reason for the constant hate
And tryna figure out what happened to 'Germaine Propane'
"He couldn't have fell off that hard." Ain't no way!
What happened to the way you was rappin'
When you was scandalous?
That Canibus turned into a television evangelist!
Plus, he raps with his regular voice

[Four impacts] "What was that?" "Pet Shop Boys."
So, we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted
His corpse was still movin', but his ass was rotted
And he kinda smelled a little like Courtney Love
I figured if I stick him with a fork, he's done
So I stabbed him twice, kept jabbin'—Christ!
He won't die! This guy's like a battered wife!
He's like Kim: he keeps comin' back for more
But he won't fight back, I cracked his jaw
Hold up! 'Bis, quit foldin' up!
Punch me in the chest, make my shoulders touch
Do something! At least one punchline!
Come on! 'Til the meter reads Nine! Nine! Nine-
Ty nine percent of my fans are blond!
'Bis, come on, answer me, man, respond!
Tell me 'bout the sun, rain, moon and stars!
Intergalactical metaphors from Mars!
Raw to the floor, raw like Reservoir Dogs!
Bite another line from Redman's song!
Suddenly, the stub of a dead man's arm
From a midget reaches out from under the car
It's J.D.! This motherfucker won't die, neither!
Dre starts sprayin' him with cans of ether
We swamped the bitch in it; stomped the bitch again
"Compton!" "Detroit, bitch, talk some shit again!"
"Stomp him!" "Switch feet!" "Stomp him!" "Switch again!"
"Dre, all right, he's dead, dog, quit kickin' him!
I think Stanibus jumped off the bridge again!" ("Ahh!")
"Damn," "He disappeared, yo, he's gone, he did it again!"

[Hook]
Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Wherefore art thou, Canibitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York, or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh, Canibitch

[Verse 1]
Old pirates, yes, they rob I
Sold I to the merchant ships
Minutes after they took I
From the bottomless pit
But my hand was made strong
By the hand of the Almighty
We forward in this generation
Triumphantly

[Chorus]
Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom?
'Cause all I ever have
Redemption songs
Redemption songs

[Verse 2]
Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our minds
Have no fear for atomic energy
'Cause none of them can stop the time
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look?
Ooh, some say it's just a part of it
We've got to fulfill the book

[Chorus]
Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom?
'Cause all I ever have
Redemption songs
Redemption songs
Redemption songs

[Acoustic Break]

[Verse 3]
Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our minds
Whoa! Have no fear for atomic energy
'Cause none of them-ah can-ah stop-ah the time
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look?
Yes, some say it's just a part of it
We've got to fulfill the book

[Chorus]
Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom?
'Cause all I ever have
Redemption songs

[Outro]
All I ever have
Redemption songs
These songs of freedom
Songs of freedom

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
I am not Jasmine, I am Aladdin
So far ahead, these bums is laggin'
See me in that new thing, bums is gaggin'
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin'
So fuck I look like gettin' back to a has-been?
Yeah, I said it, has-been
Hang it up, flatscreen
Plasma
"Hey Nicki, hey Nicki," asthma
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine
I got bars, sentencin'
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt
And I'll kick that ho, punt
Forced trauma, blunt
You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front
You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fuckin' with
You lil' Fraggle Rock, beat you with a pad-a-lock
I am a movie, camera block
You outta work, I know it's tough
But enough is enough

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I ain't into S&M, but my whip's off the chain
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame
You don't like it, then peel off, bitch
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off
And I still wouldn't fuck you, slut
So wipe the smile on your grill off
I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
Get the wheels turning, spin, and wheel off
Snap the axle in half, bust the tie-rod
Quit hollering, "Why, God?"
He ain't got shit to do with it
Bygones'll never be bygones
The world ain't finished swallowing my wad
I ain't finished blowing it, nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch, life's hard
I swear to God life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealing my music
So I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod
The moral to the story is life's treating you like dry sod?
Kick it back in its face, my God
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
But don't ask why, bitch, ask why not?
The world-world is my punching bag and
If I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots
Make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it
Like a, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
You fell off, off, they must've bumped your wagon
You must've went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end
Told you to stay in your lane, you just jumped in traffic

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Is this the thanks that I get for puttin' you bitches on?
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?
Should've sent a thank-you note, you little ho
Now I'ma wrap your coffin with a bow
"Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot"
Word, that bitch mad 'cause I took the spot?
Well, bitch, if you ain't shittin', then get off the pot
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top
I hear the mumblin', I hear the cacklin'
I got 'em scared, shook, panickin'
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a standstill, mannequin
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
Now all my niggas gettin' buck, overbite
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levis
Raggedy Anns, holes in your knee-highs
I call the play, now do you see why?
These bitches callin' me Manning, Eli
Manning, Eli, these bitches callin' me Manning, Eli

[Verse 4: Eminem]
All you lil' faggots can suck it
No homo, but I'ma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep acting as if
You have the same passion I have, yeah, right
Still hungry, my ass, you ass-dicks had gastric bypass
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids, but eyelash
Go take a flying leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony
'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
You know what time it is, so why ask?
When Shady and Nicki's worlds clash
It's high class meets white trash

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Rah, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
Roman, Roman, stop it, stop it
You've gone mad, mad, I tell you, mad
You and this boy Slim Shady
What's going on? They'll lock you away
They'll put you in a jail cell, I promise
Take your mother's warning, Roman, please
Back to bed, run along, let's go, come on
Wash your mouth out with soap, boys

[Verse 1: Drake]
Low-key Peter Parker flow
Tell her bring some Ace of Spades no sparklers though
Private flights no hassle I just park and go
I’m the highlight like when markers glow
Oooooh, look what you created
Only got yourself to blame, I remember when you hated ooooh
Now you tell me take my time
How bout I just take your city make that muthaf-cker mine uh ha
I’m a underground king ho, I sit tall, I swang low
The game ain't always fair and thats the thing though
You can play your heart out everyone don’t get a ring though
You are in the presence of a champion
Bout to get a condo that I can fit your mansion in
You always be calling her, she ain’t never answering
You ain’t figured out I am the reason that she canceling
I be at the parties where you stuck outside and can’t come in
Call me Ron Burgundy y'all the other anchormen
Whats on the news trick, gossiping bout music
Cause rumours I’m the new shit and guess what it’s true bitch

[Hook: Drake]
We made it
We made it
We made it
They hate it
They hate it
They hate it
They hate it

[Refrain: Drake, Big Sean]
I feel like we made it
But we ain't made enough
It's so amazing
You woulda thought we made it up
Man I was made to be greater
Made for the grind
Made for the lights
Made for the shine

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Ay look, I need less friends more bread
Less talk more head
Used to ride escorts now I get escorted (do it)
I’m just waiting on my cue dog no pledge
Said she like all girls I turn that bitch co-ed
Threw on my track team handed my baton to her
Passed her blew her off, I chronic Veronica
Who got up on my nerves so I had to platonic her
No that ain't my girl but every leader needs a Monica
I’m the head of my estate ain't that ironic huh
I want the baddest chick to treat my stick like a thermometer
Ohh, I’m who they going ape shit over
I’m who your girlfriend acting like she ain't shit over
See broads over niggas but business over broads
See business equals money and money’s over all
I’m tryna move my momma from the ghettos to the meadows
Well she can’t stay in that fucking hood forever, forever
Was made for that Mick Jagger shit baggage check and a chick
Fast girls, faster whip, big chains master shit
Bitch I’m living everyday month yearly
Yell until you muthfuckers hear me, we made it

[Hook: Drake]
We made it
We made it
We made it
They hate it
They hate it
They hate it
They hate it

[Intro]
La-la-la-laaaa, la lala la lalaaaa

[Chorus]
Now I am (Here's to the Roc')
Hey and they ask and they ask and they ask and I tell them
(Here's to Roc-a-Fella) It's the Fayettenam
Raise your glasses, your glasses, your glasses to the sky and
(Here's to the Roc')
This is the last call for alcohol
This is the warm-up

[Verse 1]
Now to the few niggas out there who heard my last shit
Which if I must say so myself that was a classic
I never been the type to ride my own coat tail
But it's obvious I'm here to stay, a fucking hotel
I came up, I warmed up
The next up, I blow up!
If you ain't peep the trend by now with each rap I go up
Look all he wanted was a deal so when he got it he just faded
But tell me what's a deal when you want to be the greatest?
So Jay I appreciate it, hell of a stepping stone
Wonder if he see it in my eyes I'm trying to get the throne
Wonder if the people know how many nights I spent alone
Making beats writing rhymes, thinking deep fighting time
I'm getting better but wasn't getting younger
And all that time can make the most confident nigga wonder
But never doubt it or allowed that shit to phase me yo
Just switch my thoughts up like the stations on the radio nigga now I am

[Chorus]
And they ask and they ask and they ask and I tell them
It's the Fayettenam
Put your glasses and your glasses and your glasses to the sky
This is the last call for alcohol
This is the warm-up!
So get your back up off the wall

[Verse 2]
Now may I never slip up or let my grip up
I know my girl be praying Lord just keep his pants zipped up -
Now if some groupie bitch is on his dick then make it's stiff up, at least give the nigga common sense to wrap his dick up
Toast, let’s lift up our glasses, then sip up
We fly past they look up
They don't last they give up
They don't blast we clip up then empty
And indeed we hit the target yes these niggas think they the shit and they ain't even farted yet
Style incomplete like a garbage ass quarterback
My offense is for real, ay fuck sack, niggas getting coffined in the Ville
Way too often and it feels wrong
New York niggas fuck with me, I got 'em singing Ville songs
Guess it's only right because we grew up singing they shit
Big shit, Mase shit, Nas shit, Jay shit
Time for a Carolina nigga to take his place with the greats
A slim nigga making bold statement
Uh, ay J. Cole how you do that there? I hear you blowing up my nigga
I'm like, true that yea
In NY but smile every time I flew back there
That Carolina, Fayettenam oh yea my crew back there
I go home been so long they saying, you back here? -
Took a turn for the worst boy don't move back here
Don't do that, yo who dat?
He rep the Ville when he spit it told you he be back with a record deal and he did it
Nigga, fuck spinning on my pivot homie, I'm finna travel till 'refs blow the whistle on me
I got a whole fucking city that's just sitting on me
But it fits on my back, my state is sitting on that
Will I drop? I think not I get up while they stop-like a sleeve on tank tops
They ain't give it all they got so they flop
So hey watch, how I'm finna take their spot
Now I'm starting and they not-let me show you how to stay hot
I play not, man I'm killing em even your idols feeling em dog
The same nigga used to chill in the mall
While they were still in the mall, I was up there spilling my rap
The hero fighting villains just to put the Ville on the map

[Chorus]
And they ask and they ask and they ask and I tell them
It's the Fayettenam
Put your glasses and your glasses and your glasses to the sky
This is the last call for alcohol
This is the warm-up!
So get your back up off the wall

[Outro]
Yeah man so shit, this was The Warm Up
Um, what can I say, what can I say?
If you heard The Come Up that was about just a lil nigga from North Carolina man
Fayettnam to be exact
Moved to NYC, chasing the dream
I used college, if y'all niggas don't know, I used college as a tool to get to New York
I ain't have no family up here or nothing like that, I came up here on a scholarship, nigga went to college
And the whole time I ain't even think I would have to finish college, I just thought I'd be signed by my freshman year so I wouldn't have to finish college
But it didn't happen like that obviously, a nigga graduated and things started falling into place
I got more focused, I dropped The Come Up
And I look at The Come Up like, how kinda like how I was in high school
Just picture this, The Warm Up is about a nigga who did not make the team when he tried out and I know it's a lotta niggas who know that feeling man
You try out, you think you deserve to be one the team and you go that day to look at the cut-list
You wake up and you can't even sleep, you're like, "Damn I'm gon' make the team, I did my thing at tryouts."
You go to the list. All the niggas is looking at their names on the list, some niggas is like, "Aww shit I see my name nigga I'm good, I'm good nigga I'm good, I see my name."
And you're looking for your name, and you kinda play in the back, tryna wait for niggas to clear out cause you're not sure
And you go to the list and your name ain't there
And you're like, "How the fuck did I not make this team? I'm better than him, I'm better than him, I'm better than him."
So a lotta niggas either quit or some niggas go harder and so that's kinda how I took the rap shit when I put out The Come Up
Cause ever since I was 15 I thought I was supposed to be signed
But you know, shit, everything happens for a reason
So shit fast forward to The Warm Up, this just me, like you know, me being that nigga that's practicing and making sure it's no way, it's undeniable that when I go to tryouts, there's no fucking way the coach is passing up on me, my nigga
So that's what this whole mixtape was about and lo and behold, you know
As I'm finishing the mixtape, the deal comes
Thank God, I'm blessed. Everything happens for a reason. And it couldn't have been with a more fucking, with a better fucking squad
You know the niggas I got on the squad if you listen to this then you might have heard who I signed with, I ain't even gon' blast it off like that
Shoutouts to, you know, Mark Pitts, definitely
Shoutout to my nigga Mike Rooney, my nigga E, shoutout to my whole fucking crew, man
That's The Warm Up is about man
RG what's good, Mike Shaw, my nigga Mez, Mez held me down, nigga
More than anybody in the whole fucking, in the whole crew, honestly
So shit, let's get it, man
We got a lotta shit for '09, '010, '011, '0 goddamn 35
That's all I got man, that's The Warm Up
I made the team
So when you go from making the team, now what you gotta do nigga, you gotta start
You gotta be a starter, you gotta make it to college
You gotta make it from college to the league, nigga
Trust me, I ain't get no deal and fucking relax man
I feel like I ain't made it yet period nigga
And that's all I really gotta say yo, it's The Warm Up
Thank you for listening man
Yeah

And we can do whatever we want
I can do this shit forever man (ever man, ever man)
(Ever man, ever man)
(Shit, e-e-e-e-e-e-e-ever man, ever man)

[Verse 3]
{Alternating between T-Pain and Young Cash every two bars, starting with Young Cash}

Cash in the vert, Pain in the Bugatti
15's in the bike kickin' like karate

Pussies get wet every time I say "shawty"
Chevy tall like a flyin' carpet, Teddy Abu Dhabi

Louis on my feet, Kanye West's
Aim for the head, boy, no need for the vests

Teddy protein, bitch, put it in yo' breakfast
I'm fly as fuck like I was related to the Jetsons
(?), who wanna ride with me?
Nine in my Levis, skinny jeans won't fit me

Everyday my birthday, this young nigga gifted
Seven-figure nigga still reppin' 850

Now I'm at the mall, no money, don't trip
Pain got a car the color Whoopie Goldberg's lips

Plus I got a gun the color of yo' girlfriend tongue-ring
They be like, "Them Nappy Boy niggas is on something, this shit bumping"

[Hook]

[Chorus]
They see me mowin' my front lawn
I know they're all thinking I'm so white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Can't you see I'm white and nerdy?
Look at me, I'm white and nerdy
I wanna roll with the gangstas
But so far they all think I'm too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
I'm just too white and nerdy
Really, really white and nerdy

[Verse 1]
First in my class here at MIT
Got skills, I'm a champion at D&D
M.C. Escher—that's my favorite "M.C."
Keep your 40, I'll just have an Earl Grey tea
My rims never spin, to the contrary
You'll find that they're quite stationary
All of my action figures are cherry
Stephen Hawking's in my library
My MySpace page is all totally pimped out
Got people beggin' for my Top 8 spaces
Yo, I know pi to a thousand places
Ain't got no grills, but I still wear braces
I order all of my sandwiches with mayonnaise
I'm a whiz at Minesweeper—I could play for days
Once you see my sweet moves, you're gonna stay amazed
My fingers movin' so fast I'll set the place ablaze
There's no killer app I haven't run (Run)
At Pascal, well, I'm number one (One)
Do vector calculus just for fun
I ain't got a gat but I got a soldering gun (What?)
"Happy Days" is my favorite theme song
I could sure kick your butt in a game of ping pong
I'll ace any trivia quiz you bring on
I'm fluent in JavaScript as well as Klingon
Here's the part I sing on

[Chorus]
They see me roll on my Segway
I know in my heart they think I'm white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Think I'm just too white and nerdy
Can't you see I'm white and nerdy?
Look at me, I'm white and nerdy
I'd like to roll with the gangstas
Although it's apparent I'm too
