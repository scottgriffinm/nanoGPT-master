lack belt and gauntlets all onto the floor
Zipped down my fly, whipped out my confident sword

[Hook: Royce da 5’9”]
Good God, everything about me raw
From the lyrics to the gun play
I'm hardbody, everything I say be raw
And I mean it
Everything I do be raw
What I do, I do it one way
I'm hardbody, everything about me raw
And I mean it

[Outro]
"So that is why I’m better than everyone in the world
Kiss my ass and suck my dick, everyone"

[Hook: Eminem]
From the moment I go to bed 'til I wake up
All day, this is all I can think about, baby (Oh, yeah)
So I go straight at opponents' heads with this anger
Always, ‘cause this is all I can think about, baby (Oh, yeah)

[Verse 1: Royce da 5’9”]
The chopper got about fifty bullets
Ain't no way it's accidental when I spill 'em on you
I'm the realest in the biz, how you livin'?
'Cause you can get it how you live
And while you livin', I'mma say my pull out game is so real
I still get rid of kids, now that's ill
The top of your head can fly off the top of convertibles
Ain't gon' really take no time to come through and murder you
I don't fake mine, I do this the fair way
Snitches get stitches, blown away and left on display
Hung by the grapevine, I just kicked a chair away
Let me be the first to tell you that you lookin' at a superstar
My microphone and AK-47, that's my new guitar
I don't belong to you, and I don't care who you are
Yeah, you sold a couple records, got a couple joints
Got a few Jordans, three, four pairs of Louboutins
That's besides the point like a shootin' guard
Nigga, I'm a rockstar

[Verse 2: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9'']
With whoopin' cough
I am sick, George Clooney wit' a Uzi
What kind of a movie star
Would hop out a movin' car just to prove he’s hard?
"Fuck you doin', you retard?"
Should be put in a cast as soon as we start shootin', dog
You swear I knew where the Roofies are
The way I drug a bitch... through the yard
Stuffed little Suzie in cardboard after wrappin' her nude and newly scarred
Body in waterproof tarp covered in roofin' tar
So what you so blunt for?
Did you fuckin' fall off, chump? Or did you jump?
Or did you just become bored with this?
You’re slipping into a funk, I just become morbid
And more self-absorbed in my own world, everyone orbits
Pen at the table, I don’t know when I’ll be able to stop
Told you from the gate
One thought it generally takes and I’m off to the races
Wait, mentally stable, hold your fuckin' horses
There’s nothin' more disgustin' an animal
I just got done snortin' the fuckin' bathroom soap
And the tannin' lotion
To unwarp this mind you gon' need some sort of an antidote
There’s not a pill for bananas though
It’s unfortunate, you got delusions of grandeur though
Actin' like you’re Michelangelo with a fuckin' cordless
Bitch, I'm Shredder, so you better crawl back in your shell
Or run 'fore you get injured
A fuckin' Ninja Turtle wouldn’t come toward us
Two joint forces, of course this is what blunt force is
'Cause we’d smoke you on any joint
Bad and Evil's back, bitch
You might experience some shortness of breath
As you sit with your lungs punctured
Hear their motherfuckin' tears come pourin'
If I tell you once more, then you’re done for
You’re going to have to learn
How to fuckin' hear from a ruptured eardrum
Forrest, am I clear? You Gump, you’re as dumb as a stump
To think we'd come with a trunk shortage
B-b-b-b-bass in your face, bitch
Chuck Norris’ nunchucks morph into guns, swords
This is what blood sport is
The goriest, glorious, notorious bigamous, shogun warriors
God damn, the Slaughter boy general
Once I slaughter it, you couldn’t un-slaughter it
Once I order a hit, you couldn’t un-order it
Hit's an order, this the consortium

[Hook: Eminem]
From the moment I go to bed 'til I wake up
All day, this is all I can think about, baby (Oh, yeah)
So I go straight at opponent's heads with this anger
Always, ‘cause this is all I can think about, baby (Oh, yeah)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
If I don’t got no more drama, bitch, I’m a fish outta water bottle
After all these guys I slaughter
Applause is gettin' louder, how the fuck did this happen?
I never rapped for bitches, how's it that my audience now is broader?
Devil without a cause, rebel without a pause
I am a kaze without the kami
You wouldn’t be a G if you cost me a thousand dollars
Infrared in my pencil lead
But always keep an extra one stocked though
In the back pocket and both of 'em locked
And they're loaded, like cocked twin Glocks that I’m holdin'
You better pause when you see these two dots on your colon
Fuckin' punks, you wait, just got to rockin' and rollin'
'Cause Elvis ain’t left the buildin' yet, I’m still a villain
You feel a threat when I step in and kill a set in a millisec
With the weapon of intellect, Hannibal Lecter with the black belt
In kung fu, protect your neck and

[Verse 4: Royce da 5’9”]
Respect the gun rule
Read in the Art of War book by Sun Tzu
You realize if you defy, you probably won't be around here long
Rapunzel (get over it)
Look, bitch, I got the bands in my pocket
And the drum roll poppin', that's...
That’s overkill, I keep the kill under me
I keep the chill one degree
I hit you with a hook that’ll make you see threes
You realize as soon as you beat me that you didn’t
Yeah, there’s still one of me, now me slap you
That’s a recap view, that’s normal embarrassing
And you slap me, that’s knee-slap humor, that’s hardly hilarious
So we scrap over you lyin' like a feline cub in a forest
Cherishing a kill from a dominant male

[Verse 5: Eminem]
And I’m born with Malaria
Form of Lou Gehrigs
To torture and terrify corporate America
Poor little Erica
In the morning the sheriff's and Law Enforcement
Will find one fourth of her buried
Under a barrier of the kitchen floor
With the stairs in an outdoor wooded area

[Hook: Eminem]
From the moment I go to bed 'til I wake up
All day, this is all I can think about, baby (Oh, yeah)
So I go straight at opponent's heads with this anger
Always, ‘cause this is all I can think about, baby (Oh, yeah)

[Verse 6: Royce da 5’9”]
Back then hoes didn't want him
Now the black Benz all hittin' corners
My spectacular vernacular
I spit like giving Ex-Lax to Dracula
Let me translate: I’m tryna find me a bitch
And then I’m sucking on her neck while she naked
And then I’m shitting on her

[Verse 7: Eminem]
And I’m getting boners from what I’m spitting
Getting blown to smithereens in a Toyota
Getting stoner, Jonas Brothers
Brothers, songs fricken rotisserie how these birds are flipping
A time bomb with a nervous tick
Another murder victim, I flirted with them first
And brrr—stick ‘em, I'd burn up if I try to step foot inside a Church's Chicken
*chka* Wanna *chka* make sure any who battle me crawl away
Assault and battery holiday, and just when you’re thinking that’ll be all I say
I’ll start automatically calling names and rattling off fellow rappers so pardon the analogy
But I disappear as quick as Natalee Holloway
It’s my mentality all the way, I’m normally a suicide mission to try dissin'
But one thing I never mind's getting called Elvis all the time
In the articles that you write which is why I never reply, 'cause he died shitting
So-a, shitting, I'm spitting my infinite supply of written bonafide
Kidding aside, critics take my little white dick in your eyelid like to fuck it
Switch subjects, moving on to the next one it's Ch—Chucky
Who wanna play with number one overall, Kid Cudi
A psycho buddy who might go nutty ‘cause he don’t like nobody
His knife's so bloody ‘cause he just sliced somebody
Pull out the Schick Hydro and—

[Verse 8: Royce da 5’9”]
In light of what he just said, this for those who even kinda want it
'Cause for this man, I would take a lighter
And light up all of my Lighter money
You can call it pyro money, "Hi Rihanna"
I mean wait, "Hi Tianna", wait, "Hi Tatiana", shit
I gotta problem I don’t like, it's called fuck a model-itis
Who pussy the tightest?
That’s amazing, sit your ass down
I don’t like the pussy too tight
Get the fuck outta here and have some babies
Vocabulary still ill, the 911 still will
It’s all yellow with the black stripe, Kill Bill
I’m so far ahead of the skills here
Getting ready for my past life
I’m the real deal

[Verse 9: Eminem]
Like Holyfield, think you irreplaceable? Bite it  (That’s overkill)
'Til I keel over like somebody stuffed roadkill and
Ebola in my bowl of oatmeal, you know the deal
I’m not about to sit and go through the whole spiel
Of how I’m- how I’m cold still like an old closed snowmobile
And no feeling but so jovial
But don’t be one of those who mistake me for a joke, I'm so for real
It’s what I told the phony emcee before I broke his will
Drove a drill through his skull to see his soul
Told him when I snap like a photo
He’ll get exposed like a roll of film
Now here he goes again, oh
I’m so trill, I’mma get the hoes again
Like Buffalo Bill's bitch, you didn’t put lotion in
The bucket, fuck it, beat the poor little old widow
With throw pillows, soap brillos, finished my goat milk then
Smoke billows I lit up— ah, fuck it!

[An original Yung Gud beat over Meek Mill's track Monster]

[Hook:]
The money turned me into a monster
The money turned my noodles into pasta
The money turned my tuna into lobster
They want to do me I maneuver like a mobster

[Verse 1:]
4 A.M. I'm on the north side of Philly
Riding around like these haters don't want to kill me
It's a shame how they hate on me you gotta feel me
I started out with a dollar and got a milli
I'm like do it for the gram ho, do it for the gram ho
She don't want to bust it I say do it for them bands yo
I say do it for them bands fucking with that broke nigga you should do it for your man
Lately I've been on the low with a ho that you probably know
Took her to the crib and met momma right at the door
Momma started smiling like momma I got to go
I done took so many trophies to momma my momma know
I said a real nigga, I get that money pay them bills nigga
My momma told me "you a real nigga"
And I be hanging with them real killers
Now what a feeling when you looking at the latest whip and knowing you can cop it
Or looking at the baddest bitch and knowing you could pop it
The youngest nigga in my city doing it, I got it
On another level with Benjamin and money is the topic
Lord

[Hook:]
The money turned me into a monster
The money turned my noodles into pasta
The money turned my tuna into lobster
They want to do me I maneuver like a mobster

[Bridge:]
I put my jeweler on his feet
Hundred thou I used to do that every week
Never sleep it's funny how it never speak
You see a foreign in my city that was me

[Verse 2:]
That was us, never sweet
We went to war, niggas riding down the street
Popping that pistol they talking they never did
Dropping the nickel with something that never cease
I've been sitting on that money like a chair
I've been getting to that money all year
All year and my niggas all here
But we started from the bottom we was selling hard squares
Baddest bitch in the game wearing my chain, I'm ready
Switching lanes in that Mulsanne like I'm Andretti
I do the Balmain, Balenciaga, no Giuseppe
If they sleep on Meek Milly I kill these niggas like I was Freddy
I eat that pussy like a monster
She gon' ride this dick, she need a sponsor
You could tell I'm Philly from my posture
And we be whipping coca like it's pasta
I be on money, 2 milly 4 milly no I need more money
I get that "see a bad bitch and be like how you doing" money
They be like how you doing honey oh

[Hook:] + 

[Bridge:]
The money turned me into a monster
The money turned my noodles into pasta
The money turned my tuna into lobster
They want to do me I maneuver like a mobster

I put my jeweler on his feet

Never sleep it's funny how it never speak
You see a foreign in my city that was me

Yo, he was the realest, I was the baddest, we was the illest

In and out them dealers, rockin' chinchillas
I got him in the back of that 'bach, I think he catchin' feelings
Now it's all eyes on us, and this all lies on trust
And if them bitches wanna trip, tell 'em they tour guide's on us
This kitty cat on reclusive, he duck, duckin' them gooses

We was the fliest, up in the buildin' (oh, ooh)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
I wanna know the girl in the other coach
Show anything you wanna see
Fly anywhere you wanna go
I'll take you to New Orleans
I'll take you to Tokyo
But there's different strokes for different folks
And I know you love girl
Girl I know you wanna stay
But it won't be long 'til it's judgement day
Though we die here under two lovers
Know they're different folks, more different folks

[Pre-Chorus]
So let's get ourselves together
Time to pack up fast
Time for the greatest game
Cause tomorrow is not promise
No, tomorrow is not promise
To make this a holiday
So let's make this a holiday

[Chorus]
Don't be running out
Cuz ain't no one around
But me, myself and I
Just me, myself and I
Is just the three of us and no one else
Just me, myself and I
So let's make this you and I, girl

[Verse 2]
Girl I must confess
You got me so impressed

Let's have some fun tonight
Feeling's all so right
So girl, just come with me

[Pre-Chorus]
So let's get ourselves together

Prepare for the greatest game
Cause tomorrow is not promise

[Verse 1]
She bad, ahlie? Ahlie
You should bring a couple friends to the bed tonight, ahlie
She only stuck up when she talkin' to Fargo
Got a nina, but I don't ever gas her though
I just tell her, she got it, she got it, she got it
And I need that, nigga, need that
All up in her ear like the feedback
Gucci, Louis, Prada, you could keep that
It's first class, put your seat back
Look, I need that
The baddest out my city and I mean that
I'ma buy lil mama the new Celiné bag
I'ma spend 'em commas up on her mean ass
Drama, any nigga fuckin' with lil mama
Tone up, how to fit it, gon' and still gone love her
10 on the Rollie
Zip lock, no tick tock on the Rollie
Nigga still walkin' with the .40

[Bridge]
Still in and out the door like the Fruit Loop
Big money everywhere, young rich nigga in a new coupe
I see the money everyday
I'm talkin' 'bout how I came up just a lil nigga
With this dough everywhere
And I finally got it, they see me and they nodded

[Chorus]
She got it, she got it, she got it
She bad, ahlie, ahlie and I need that
If a man get's that, he'll be glad, ahlie, ahlie and I need that
Girl, put that body in focus, yeah

[Interlude]
Lay down. Nah, I'm not talkin' too fast, you just listenin' too slow, feel me. Fargo

[Verse 2]
And you noticed, girl stay focused
Fuck all that slow shit, I keep it honest
Back in Miami, she see me in Phantom's and now she lay down
And she came dancin' up on me and kept me up
Actin' like she was the motherfuckin' lay down
And you know how they do
You're outta line, you're outta line, you're outta line
And my nigga Pain once said, he say, "You're outta line"
That's why I know you're outta line, lay down

[Bridge]
Still in and out the door like the Fruit Loop
Big money everywhere, young rich nigga in a new coupe
I see the money everyday
Talkin' 'bout how I came up just a lil nigga
With this dough everywhere
And I finally got it, they see me and they nodded, Fargo

[Chorus]
She got it, she got it, she got it
She bad ahlie, ahlie

[Chorus]
Shawty, I been at it all day
On this corner with this motherfuckin' plot and this nina on my side
Lil mama is a rider
I need her by my side like the .40 and the nina on my side
And mama used to tell me
"Don't you go outside, outside where the young niggas die"
I need a lil mama, I need a lil mama
Like a nina on my motherfuckin' side
Said I need a lil mama, said I need a lil mama
Like a nigga need a nina on his side
Nigga need lil mama, yeah, I need lil mama
Like a nigga got nina on his side
Said I need a lil mama, said I need a lil mama
Like a nigga need a nina on his side
Nigga need lil mama, yeah, I need lil mama
Like a nigga got nina on his side

[Bridge]
That's forever yo, that's forever yo, that's forever
That's forever yo, that's forever yo, that's forever
That's forever yo, that's forever yo, that's forever
That's forever yo, that's forever yo, that's forever

[Verse]
Got this nina on my side by the way
Nigga, I ride by the way
Niggas is talkin', I'm slidin' by the way
That's why I keep my lil mama by the waist
Shawty gotta ride by the way
But I ain't goin' outside by the way
A lot of niggas move grime a lot of ways
But TO niggas, we don't watch no fakes
And my nigga's on the way
He just came home the other day
Shout out my dawgs that bust out the case
And all my niggas that they got locked away
It’s goin' fast by the way
Nigga, we don't even trap by the way
I stopped carin' if I pass by the way
I seen a hundred thousand cash in a day, nigga

[Bridge]
That's forever yo, that's forever yo, that's forever
That's forever yo, that's forever yo, that's forever
That's forever yo, that's forever yo, that's forever
That's forever yo, that's forever yo, that's forever

[Chorus]
Shawty, I been at it all day
On this corner with this motherfuckin' plot and this nina on my side

And mama used to tell me

I need a lil mama, I need a lil mama
Like a nina on my motherfuckin' side
Said I need a lil mama, said I need a lil mama
Like a nigga need a nina on his side
Nigga need lil mama, yeah, I need lil mama
Like a nigga got nina on his side
Said I need a lil mama, said I need a lil mama
Like a nigga need a nina on his side
Nigga need lil mama, yeah, I need lil mama
Like a nigga got nina on his side

[Verse 1]
You got, somethin' that I do want, somethin' that you do got
You, so fly, I'll fly your ass, I'll fly you to Dubai
Move round the blue sky, drive in a new ride
You so bad you can't come, round my niggas
'Cause all us thirsty, really though
We be goin' in, like we all got curfews, really though
By the way, who the fuck, is knock-knockin' at the function?
Man, I hate when a nigga cockblockin' at the function
I'm tryna get laid tonight
Tryna find a group of all girls who down for their ladies night
'Cause you know it's on when I come
Pullin' up clean in my Nike Airs
Nightmares at the bottom
Got up mobbin' through the city of the eve
In my Yves Saint Laurent shirts and palm sleeves
But you know, that it's all for you
And when I'm down on the ground and fucked up
Girl, I'll call for you
Know that you're needed, know that you're needed
'Cause when these hoes hoed out and these niggas sold out
Girl, you still down

[Chorus]
You're always down
You're always down
You're always down
You're always down
Don't, don't go
Don't stay
Don't, can we go?
Don't, don't go
Don't stay
Don't, can we go?

[Verse 2]
I swear you been down since 6th grade
Down with all my shit, I didn't even have shit straight yet
You remember them days?
Nigga probably wouldn't eat
If it wasn't for you workin' at the Micky D's real late
Girl I, thuggin', hustlin', strugglin'
Tryna bring money in, you know you were there for that
I remember that day, you lent me your Civic
It ran outta gas but I ain't have money to pay but
Fuck it, I'm on now, my money is long now
Got drivers to open the door now
Put diamonds in both of your drawers now
And you know this shit for you
Fuck with your nigga, baby
I been that nigga since day 1
The one that you talk to when shit is crazy
Lately I feel like we lost touch, wanna gain that back
I wanna lean on you without havin' to drink that Act'
Girl, you know, don't wanna think that back
I wanna give my trust but, don't wanna take that back

[Bridge]
Girl, let me know if, you are down for this
'Cause I'm so, so down
Oh it will go down
And when it does go, and when it does go
Just know I love you, and you know its true
Fuck with me tonight, I think this shit right
I did this shit right
I think this feel right
I think this feel right
I think this feel right

[Chorus]
You're always down
You're always down
You're always down
You're always down
Don't, don't go
Don't stay
Don't, can we go
Don't, don't go
Don't stay
Don't, can we go

[Verse 1]
I, I can't begin to apologize
For all the crazy shit I said last night
There's no happy endin'
I, I never saw it from your side
I might be stubborn and I must be blind
Not to see you for me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, and it hurts like hell
I never wanted to be by myself
I try to comeback runnin'
I try to comeback runnin'
I'm tryin' to comeback but its 2 late
Cuz I know that you'd be

[Chorus]
Already gone, you're already gone
Baby, come back, don't turn away, away from me
I want you back but its 2 late
I know you'd be already gone, you're already gone
Baby, come back, don't turn away, away from me
Try to comeback, but its 2 late
You're already gone

[Verse 2]
Why? Why did I take so long to try?
I'd give it all to turn the hands out time
And to the beginnin', oh

[Pre-Chorus + Chorus]

[Bridge]
I wish I could be where you are
Would someday I'll be
I'll be right there back in your arms
Cuz I know that you'd be

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Hey, he's a man
He's a short man, the shortest man you'll see
It's DJ E-V, he's the shortest man you'll see
Rolling with the K-I-D C-U-D-I
It's DJ E-V, he's the shortest DJ you'll see
Hey!
Yo, uhm, holla at me my nigga, haha
We doing it big
We not playing games, Kid Cud
I love everybody
I love the hate
I love the positive
I love everything man
Show me love when you meet, when you see me
You know how to holla, dream on

[Verse 1]
I don't know about you but I could use some sun
Your weary soul is tired too
And you need just some fun
Oh, say you want to, say you want to go

[Chorus]
Let's go down to Kokomo
Drink our tales on the shore
Dance together nice and slow
Cruise to Margaritaville, fall in love again we will
Baby no one else will do as long as I'm with you
As long as I'm with you, as long as I'm with you
As long as I'm with you, as long as I'm with you
As long as I'm with you, as long as I'm with you
As long as I'm with you, you
As long as I'm with you, as long as I'm with you
As long as I'm with you

[Verse 2]
We can pay or we can beg
And sail into the night
Or ride the waves of the ocean blue
And hold each other tight
Oh say you want to, say you want to girl

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Girl come on and take a ride
Baby let's go, let's go, let's go
So forget your nine to five
Cuz we're leaving here tonight
Let's go

[Chorus]

[Intro]
Pharaoh, pharaoh?
Pharaoh

[Verse 1]
Dollar mission, Mississippi Masala getting
Guava Casaba melons, getting a spot at competition
Titties and teeth, so silly of me, no really, it’s free
Aye you can use the phone like a new computer wand
That’s an Ethernet pun, cause dial-up’s all done
When it took twenty minutes just to download one
Aye, you got a fine face, also a dime in your behind
Please can I find some time space to find base
Kinds of rhymes to describe how you’re designed great
And maybe remove the mind freight
Like it’s overhead cranes at the train yard
That Tom Cruise used in the War of the World's
Before the aliens came part
Remember that? Oh, not a fan of the sci-fi?
Like dial-up’s not a fan of the wi-fi
I’m in your eyes like little reflective little pools of tie-dye
And it’s 1972 and I’m some long-haired high guy
Driving a Volkswagen Beetle off into the California twilight
I usually got top cause I’m a guy right
But if you’re gay that’s straight too
Hey, I don’t hate, I got a couple of friends who went bi twice
Did that arrive right?
Do you like whole stories or just the highlights
Cause I like to write your life story on the sky
Made of Lite Brites, remember those?
Ten years old, let me guess your age
You were a ten, ten years ago
Am I right, who you calling?
Maybe New Orleans where your mother lives
With your brother's kids
Cause he locked up cause
Of what some other motherfucker did
Love to fib 'bout the Fibonacci sequence
Do you flicker like Liberace Sequins
Or maybe twinkle like little stars
And tingle like little scars
I run a wrinkle with you like a car hood
And crash test and beat-box while we rewrite
Saul Williams doing the slam set
Then wrap like saran over the pan
Keep the yams fresh, sweet
Five different songs, over five different beats
And this one’s called Valley
I wrote it on the plane in the chair by the galley
On the way to Cali, chicken in the salad
Sounds like a ballad
You loyal, so I’m Khaled
Buy your momma a palace
Scratch that, buy your momma what matters
Data says dollars hotter than two Nevadas
Burning hole in the pockets
And in the wallets of all the rappers
Trappers attracting all the yellowbone Instagrammers
But what about us?

[Interlude]
Pharaoh, Pharaoh, Pharaoh

[Verse 2]
It burns inside like lactic acid
Exorcise demons, turn them into gods
Turning in the rods for the bags of the catfish
I don’t believe that God is a black man
Spoiled child getting robbed for his black mans
Mars and other stars in the CAT scans
Back when I listened to Killah Priest
Had my mind thicker and bigger than Philip Heath
Walking round in kufis with sunnis with dhikr beads
Remembering the movies my duty was killing beats
Social villain unwilling to live in peace
I told you children I’m wielding a living beast
Streets, this is where Helen and Ellen meet
So you can get lost like Gilligan on the beach
The players getting mad they not kicking it with the freaks
Cause they took away they pussy and giving it to the geeks
Like us, paradigm shifter, South Carolina Nine shrine shine giver
But not enough dimes to be a crime line tipper
The difference between "nigga", and "niggar"
Uh, Bernie Sanders need a Nike deal
Then I might consider that he might be real
If Phil Knight knight him, then I might like him
Until then children, enjoy the white icing on the cake
Cake, cake, cake, cake
On the cake, cake, cake, cake, cake
On the cake, cake, cake, cake, cake
On the cake, cake, cake, cake, cake
Yeah, yeah, pharaoh, height, yeah

[Verse 3]
What you need a little more? Okay, I’ll give-I'll give you a little more, I’ll give you a little more.. maybe like, like, yeah, yeah
Freestyle off the top, sitting on the stool on the block
Watching  for the cops, watching for the thots, watching for the shots
I’m watching for a lot, I gotta use my eyes cause they use me
Cause to them I’m like a price, so I say surprises
And they don’t deprive us, I just demise us
And nothing ever lies yes, on my premisises
Watched for my demises
Maybe might like them, until then just enjoy the white icing on the cake
Cake, cake, cake, cake
The cake, cake, cake, cake, cake
The cake, cake, cake, cake, cake
The cake, cake, cake, cake,cake

[Outro]
Ameri-cake, cake, cake, cake, cake
The cake, cake, cake, cake, cake
The cake, cake, cake, cake, cake
The cake, cake, cake, cake, cake
Ameri- the cake, cake, cake, cake, cake
The cake, cake, cake, cake, cake
The cake, cake, cake, cake, cake
The cake, cake, cake, cake, cake
Ameri-cake, cake, cake, cake, cake

[Produced by J Dilla]

[Verse]
Young peerer over Dilla
Behind the mic like the wheel of a vehicular killer
The threading, put it together like a three minutes to wedding
In less than three minutes of meddling, over melody and grand piano peddlings
I do represent the mind like IQs, intelligent signs in our kinds of haiku
Cobra Kai turn high top fade to Caillou, who inspect a man stance and fight the kaiju
Way beyond a hundred kicks, breaking bottom bricks and he on number six
This is that “there should be a name for it”
Hideo should go and make a game for it
Mama should make you change for it
Kinda rap that sends jaguars running back into the rain forest
Plans over panic, when Superman scans deadpan over planets
Make the fat man hand over the ham jam and lamb and Spam sandwich
A face black eyes and hand-to-hand damage
Make ‘em believe you can manage to have swam the span, fam
It's Sesame the bird big, and the master plan mammoth
Yeah!
(Pharaoh)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & (Pitbull)]
We could be anywhere tonight
But we're right here underneath the lights
I see the colors in your eyes
Beautiful rainbows all around us
We got the whole world in our hands (Mr. Worldwide)
This is the night we won't forget (Chris Brown)
Whatever happens in the end, I just hope
I hope we meet again

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown & (Pitbull)]
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
I just hope, I hope we meet again
(To those lost, but never forgotten)

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
One thing's for certain, two things for sure
IHeart radio, I close show
My life's like Broadway, no cameras, welcome to the show
One time for them boys on Dyckman
Broadway, Nagle, and posted on Post
Papo, I told ya, they'll be coming back one day
Throw this song to the world and watch 'em catch it like a bouquet
Australia to UK, jump the puddle straight to the States
It's okay, let 'em hate, 'cause they'll be coming back one day, dalé

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
We could be anywhere tonight
But we're right here underneath the lights
I see the colors in your eyes
Beautiful rainbows all around us
We got the whole world in our hands
This is the night we won't forget
Whatever happens in the end, I just hope
I hope we meet again

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown & (Pitbull)]
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I hope we meet again
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I just hope, I hope we meet again
(To those lost, but never forgotten)

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Now the world is my backyard and I would like to thank y'all
'Cause I was at a point, point blank, that I would point blank y'all
I found myself, in turn, I lost my mind
Sometimes I feel like an old school marimbero lost in time
They say to be wise, is to know what you don't know
And I don't know shit, does that make me wise? Papo, I don't know
But this much I can't say, to my best friend Eddie, my father, Guarilla, Abuelo Rudy, and to my brother Drama
I'll be back for you one day (Woo)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
We could be anywhere tonight
But we're right here underneath the lights
I see the colors in your eyes
Beautiful rainbows all around us
We got the whole world in our hands
This is the night we won't forget
Whatever happens in the end, I just hope
I hope we meet again

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown & (Pitbull)]
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
(To the world, and all my friends, I hope we meet again)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
(To the world, and all my friends, I hope we meet again)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
(To the world, and all my friends, I hope we meet again)
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
(To the world, and all my friends, I hope we meet again)
I hope we meet again

[Verse 1]
I leave the lights on
Turn the sound up on my TV
Trust my words girl, you’ll never get the best of me
Cause you decided we, when we divided
You made my bed but I don’t have to sleep in it

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Tossing and turning in my bed
Tryna get you out of my head
If I can’t get through the night
I’m hoping and praying I can get over you

[Chorus 1]
Girl you got me losing sleep
I’m never gonna dream again
If I can’t have you next to me
I’d rather not crave pretend

Girl you got me losing sleep
So I’d never close my eyes again
Cause when I do you’re all I see
And you’ll only break my heart
Won’t let you break my heart again, oh
Won’t let you break my heart again

[Verse 2]
Staring at the ceiling
Counting seconds ’til the walls cave in
Told myself that the world is not about to wait
‘Cause I decided, I was gonna fight it
And never ever, ever see your face again

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Tearing every memory apart
Tryna get you out of my heart
If I can’t get through the night
I’m hoping and praying I can get over you

[Chorus 2]
Girl you got me losing sleep
I never wanna dream again
If I can’t have you next to me
I’d rather not crave pretend

Girl you got me losing sleep
I’d never close my eyes again
‘Cause when I do you’re all I see
You’ll only break my heart
Won’t let you break my heart again, yes
You’ll only break my heart again

[Bridge]
I’m so tired, I’m so tired
I gotta stay up, I gotta fight it
Sleep’s out to get me, I’ll start a riot
(You can’t get away from me
You can’t get away from me)
I’m so tired, I’m so tired
I gotta stay up, I gotta fight it
Sleep’s out to get me, I’ll start a riot
(You can’t get away from me)

[Chorus 3]
Girl you got me losing sleep
I’m never gonna dream again
If I can’t have you next to me
I’d rather not crave pretend

Girl you got me losing sleep
I’d never close my eyes again
‘Cause when I do you’re all I see
You’ll only break my heart
Won’t let you break my heart again, oh

[Produced by The Weeknd & Jason “DaHeala” Quenneville]

[Verse 1]
As I proceed to go dig through an old crib
Hold kids as I plunder through a pharaoh house
Thug Bones in gilded apparel piss
But arrow heads then let the marrow out
I literally won't leave litter since I've received the Brita
And when the sea leaves the land, who will feed the rivers, huh?
Crazy busy, make me, make me miss ya even when I'm with ya
If a phone calls in the club, but the music is too loud around to hear it
Do I still have to clear it?
Example: now I don’t let samples in my lyrics
Myth be told, 60 souls perished in the parish bill
Wrote a pair of wills on 50 scrolls with a pair of quills
Answered the question 'Americause?' Amerikills
Been living inside in envelopes with a pair of sills
Tall man like terror bills downfall from a pair of stilts wearin' heels, that's high
As I proceed to find silver line in a stalagmite
Cat eyes and scarab crowns on a black grace
Too wave, not to see bubonic plague in your rat face
Practice on the uttering until it lactates
Then begin the buttering of the pancakes
Push it to the margin flood the garden to the land lakes
Associate with mates who spit inside of they handshakes, yeah
(Pharaoh, pharaoh, pharaoh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
As I walk through the shadow of San Fernando Valley
Walkin' like fingers how, how they rally on pianos
Up and down the dial until I WKRP, in Cincinnati
Let's settle on the station like "Last gas for 100 miles"
May I have this last dance?
Grab her hands then proceed to do the runnin' child
Vindaloo the stomach growls, introduced to somethin' wild
Until we see civilization, Walmarts and Chik-a-fallacious
Patience, our art isn't intimidation
But you can't process the progress
If you get your style cues from outta Complex
Nah nigga, that ain't hot
No, no and no shots, no boas and no thots
I walk 'em over the motorboat on the yachts
To go so sober on all the shirk and on overdose on salats, huh?
Francis Ford Coppola’s spoken plots
Hyannis Port localists rollin' in open drops
Titanic corpse smokin' from openin' those with chops
Lycanic moonlit leader loc'in with loaded Glocks, huh!

[Produced by Flying Lotus]

[Intro]
FlyLo, Lupe, I go

[Verse]
Metabolize on the scattered snare
With the banana pies that he don't like
Like mosquito bites on the shins or ankles
In the end it bends
Let's begin and pretend it's tranquil
Upset stomach on the boat to Lucerne to see the lion
Carved in the wall by the pond
To commemorate the soldier dying over old divines
Ergo sum empire, not the inch but the entire
More pills mean more spills by the whore house with the extra door
To let the divorced out with force
And other course routes, of course
Cleopatra speaking patois with a mouth full of that jerk chicken
With rum in hand for the curse lifting
Onion bread with the shine to it
It's up and fair to define stupid
But she ain't dumb, at least she know that he ain't fun
And neither's Europe, even to the Middle Eastern tourists
Where oil is spent by the drum load
How many millionaires can the slums hold?
Potentially all of us, this whole plane and all the bus
As juggernauts bust through a wall of trust
You strain to see through the fog of dust
Like spaghetti for the meatballs
Of dust Parmesan immaculates
Head over heels like a back is flipped
The Japanese don’t perceive Atlanta-ness
Love labors, get her backstage like the judge chambers
Everyone under the sun loves hugs from a young stranger
Or do us, oh foo us
On boats in the Bay of Pigs
Runaways wait with the wayward kids
And the underpaid slaves from Jamaican gigs
Don't shoe us, cause we ain't Bush
We ain't hoofs don't boo us cause we ain't cooked
But who else could hook the fufu up
In this book I mean, dumplings with dark continents
Dumb things even bar common sense
Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes a terpin intertwines with the turbans
Vines with turbans and removes the minds of serpents
Detergents, deterrents and permits, to build a hut
Twerk team, Operation Build-a-Butt
Great like Gildersleeve
As a king breathes through a silver sieve
Jack and Jill ain't up that hill enough
Filtering lean through a gold grill
Theorize things from swole hills
They came became what that po' kills
Throw ho drills on that hotel, that'll oil spill
Looking at space from a submarine
Putting that bass in the club machine
Pushing that cake till it mush in that face ain't no love between
Fancy ass man wearing glove and rings
Flying round town in a tub of wings
Found out how to make love to fiends
He mixing that fudge with the drug of dreams
She too teenage to have a drug of choice
But she fuck with that Royce like she love Detroit
She rollin'
(Pharaoh, pharaoh)

[Intro]
(Uncle Lupe)
Alright it's time to go to sleep
(Hey Uncle Lupe)
What?
(Can you please tell us a bedtime story?)
Ugh, it's late man
Okay, okay okay, check this out, listen

[Verse 1]
Cold killer, bold old guerrilla
Bold as a font with the thickness
Old as yellow gold in a Chevrolet with a stick shift
The story goes his mother left him on a church step
First step was out the front door then the first left
Down the block to the spots where the worst kept
Thirty years later got a thirty tier caper
To shoot up the scene and scheme
Plot, broken all down to two rounds of scotch
A pound means now and we too down to stop
Say ya got enough round for two thousand cops
Military grade, these things shoot round the block
Shh threat, check
The dame will hang out like chains round the neck
He ever seen her before, her face don't connect
No, so keep it on the low, go
Seizes her by the arm
Looks right into the eyes cause these be the charms
Sheba, King Tut suite at the Khalifa
Tied to a chair getting burned by Cohibas
A well dressed thug who run clubs in the Koreas
The room smells like fresh hand made tortillas
He recognized the tattoos of a real big Maui brother
Known for bad news when his cash rules
Are you familiar with the shell of the cashews?
As he holds the needle up to the light bulb
White girls enter drunk, he stands up runs to the window and jumps
Aim for the pool... splash
The impact from that almost split him in half
Voice from the past asks did he enjoy the bath
Laughs with his arm in a cast, hold up

[Chorus]
Never what it seems, everybody wanna be seen
On the cover of a magazine
Everybody want big things
Everybody want big dreams
Everybody want bling bling
Everybody wanna be the king
Everybody bling
Everybody sings
Everybody wanna big thing
In the valley of kings and pyramid schemes
It's never what it seems, everybody wanna be seen
On the cover of a magazine
Everybody wanna sip lean
Everybody want a big dreams
Everybody want bling bling
Everybody want C.R.E.A.M
Everybody wanna have a team
Everybody wanna be the king
Everybody want a big scheme in the land of pyramid schemes

[Verse 2]
As he tried to do the math with Smearcon the fed
The contract states from here upon you're dead
The girl at the bar is an underworld star
Settling on debts with north Zanzibar
Your name's on the list, kitsch
A hundred million dollars worth of high grade fish
Tuna, Tokyo cartels worlds biggest consumer
A rumor bout a schooner off the coast of Montezuma
They say you slit the throat of a well known kahuna
Then torched the boat and fled into the Dunya
You’re hated more than a Kalua pig at a Jumu'ah
They want your head on a platter, not right now but sooner
I got you a .45 and a Mitsubishi tuner
Wait, wait I've never been to Costa Rica
And then it all comes back
Just as Smearcon falls with a ninja star in his head like..huh
Then they slowly enter the room
I grabbed a .45, the ninja stars resume
I catch him in the cast and answer them with a blast, blow
Three more shots for good measure
Only exit is another window, pfft, whatever
Short fall to the roof of the car
Then I get in, left arm covered in ninja stars
Then a zero to a hundred baby real quick
Look around the car for something else to kill with
Lamborghini headlights in the rear view
These Parisian streets not meant to veer through
Especially with just one hand
I let go to shoot back but the gun jams
Mitsubishi not built to outrun Lambs
So they gaining, heavy raining
Rear view explodes from deadly aiming
Arm paining, blood draining
Pains, head for the Louvre
Drive right through the glass pyramid with dope moves
A little shook from the landing
Driving through the Louvre in a rally car with great handling
Was at the Mona Lisa
Stop the car right in front of the Delacroix and have a breather
Press play on the radio, voice from the speaker
Says get to Belgrade and take an ad out in the daily Politika
They says for a good time call this Ecuador slash Venezuelan chica
Next day at the airport meeted by a greeter who looks Corsican but Greeker
A little older wearing Michael Jordan sneakers
But I follow the leader
1995 S. Class, in the back seat is a dead man whose car I just crashed
Smearcon's alive, audience now wonders how Smearcon survived
Let alone not be hurt, he taps a metal plate in his head from his Afghanistan work
What Visine for red retinas, what else would you expect from head predators
Ex-lecturer, at Exeter, the dean too secular
So now I'm totes hecklers, everywhere
Now Smearcon's on the team, so everybody's down for the scheme

[Interlude 1]
(The final chapter in the incredible ape saga)
(Smearcon's back!)

[Verse 3]
Now it's time to finish this, getting too late for international syndicates
To which the driver reveals his membership
This won't end well, he pulls out a grenade and says
(Damn you all to hell!)

[Interlude 2]
(Wait, what happened? Uncle Lupe what's going on?)
Go to sleep
(But what happened? I don't understand)
Nope
(Please finish the story please)
Storytime's over
You asked for a story I gave you one
Take it, just take it
(This is the worst bedtime story ever)
Bye

[Verse 4]
Psych sucker, Smearcon is back
You really think that he would go out like that?
They're under attack, MAC under the back...

[Outro]
I'm just playing, it's really over
It's the end of the tape
Thank y'all man
Pharaoh Height two thirty, Yeah
Shout to DJ Busy
You know how we do
Uhh Uhh hah
Hope you all enjoyed it man, Yeah
Scott what up
What you thought I couldn't do this no more, huh?
Man listen, lets let this play out
Bogglin' Giblets

[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
Pull up on my job and make ‘em go work
We hit the singles club, her hips are double time
Got three finals this week but she don't care she get some money first
I understand to feel myself, I started from the dirt
Now I’m just like clean, our goal is to flip a silver dollar out a dream
I mean it looks just how it seems
Apologize if that came off as open-ended
She took it as back-handed and got offended
Like you know what, you no different
You think every bitch is the same
And boy don't you know them chips can dip as quick as they came
I came to the scene she want the taste of the F-A-M-E
At the end she want a lick of that co-co-co-cocaine
Tell you like your voice, let your hips do the talking
Contrary to what you think they really say this often
But watching you whine make me really wanna know
Would you mind, if you with it we can go

[Hook: Syd]
Girl, just go with it
Lose control, just roll with it
Take your time
You're learnin’, baby
Girl, it's all good

[Verse 2: Syd]
By the way, I knew she was looking for me
By the way that she crossed her legs
I knew she wanted somethin', lovin', going all the way
Baby, if you let me I can show you how to loosen up
Take a chance and dance with me, relax and let your hair down
I really want to be with you, and I know you want me too, babe
It’s you, babe

[Hook: Syd]
Girl, just go with it
Lose control, just roll with it
Take your time (Take your time)
You're learnin’, baby
Girl, it's all good (Girl)

[Bridge: Syd]
It’s alright, babe, alright, babe
You know you got me giving it up
You know you like me, like me
Baby go with the flow (ahh)
Oh, yeah

[Interlude: Syd]
Shake shake, shake shake
Shake shake, shake shake, ooh
Shake shake, shake shake
Shake shake, shake shake
Don’t stop baby, don’t stop baby, ooh
Shake shake, shake shake
Shake shake, shake shake

[Spoken Interlude: Syd]
Hey, what you doing after this?
Word, well um
Won’t you go get your friends
Lets get out of here
Ready?

[Hook: Syd]
Girl, just go with it
Lose control, just roll with it
Take your time
You're learnin’, baby, ooh
Girl, it's all good

[Part I: Palace]

[Intro: Tyler, the Creator]
Ayy, y’all ain't never been to a party before?

[Verse 1: Tyler, the Creator]
I don’t know what to say
But I couldn't let you get away

[Part II: Curse]

[Chorus: Steve Lacy]
Baby, you make me believe
I could fall in love at first
Sight, how you stunned me with your
Body, I'm under your curse
Baby, I'm under your curse
Baby, I'm under your curse

[Verse: Syd]
Babe, baby, you're my lady

[Verse 1]
They said her name was Destiny
When they called her to the stage
But I looked at those eyes
She started dancing next to me
I knew I'd never be the same
Well, I whispered in her little technicolored ear
"Girl let's get out of here"

[Chorus]
What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas
But I wanna bring you home with me
I know we can make it; it's outrageous
But I won't give up on these beer dreams
In Vegas, oh, in Vegas
But ooh, in Vegas, Destiny happened to me

[Verse 2]
Sin City gave her everything
But hearts damaged in clubs
Will never be enough
'cause every queen deserves a king
And all you really need is love
Love and a hundred bucks
Well! I whispered in her little technicolored ear
"Girl let's get out of here"

[Chorus]
What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas
But I wanna bring you home with me
I know we can make it; it's outrageous
But I won't give up on these beer dreams
In Vegas, oh, in Vegas
But ooh, in Vegas, Destiny happened to me

[Bridge]
Now I let you're gone
I stare at the phone and I think of you every night
But baby, someday I'll come back
And I'll spend the rest of my life with you
Spend the rest of my life with you

[Chorus]
What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas
But I wanna bring you home with me
I know we can make it; it's outrageous
But I won't give up on these beer dreams
In Vegas, oh, in Vegas
But ooh, in Vegas, Destiny happened to me

[Verse 1]
Don’t you know my lungs are filled with words?
And every single letter is about your name, oh
And every time I give you a call
It all pours down like a waterfall

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s my fault for thinking that I
Can be the one to make you change
‘Cause you do what you want to
And never listen to me anyway
And every time that you roll your eyes
I feel like I’m

[Chorus]
Talking underwater
Why can’t you hear I love ya?
Don’t think I can take no more
Words are wasted on you, baby
Talking underwater
Why can’t you hear I love ya?
You don’t care what I'm about
Talking underwater

[Verse 2]
I was hoping my love could be the cure
Oh, but looking at your face, I’m not too sure
Could it be that you mean more than me?
Then I would ever be the all, oh

[Pre-Chorus + Chorus]

[Post-Chorus]
Words are wasted on you baby, oh
Words are wasted on you baby, oh
Words are wasted on you baby
Words are wasted on you baby, oh

[Bridge]
Every time I’m talking to you
It seems you’re not even listening to me
I don’t understand what that is
Just selfish, damn
I feel like I’m

[Chorus x2]

[Outro]
Words are wasted on you, baby, oh
Talking underwater
Words are wasted on you, baby, oh
Talking underwater
Words are wasted on you, baby
Why can’t you hear I love ya?
Words are wasted on you, baby
Talking underwater
Every time I’m talking to you
It seems you’re not even listening to

[Verse 1]
I thought my faith was gone
And I was left so blind
I put my best foot forward
Still a step behind
Underneath that bridge
Where we wrote our names
I wonder if it's still there
And if a chance remains

[Pre-Chorus]
For that feeling
To be with someone who means it
To give me some kind of reason
To walk through the fire (To walk through the fire)
'Cause I needed something I can believe in
You and I was so near it
But we drifted apart

[Chorus]
(So what, so what)
I know I'll be alright
(So what, so what)
But when I close my eyes
I don't wanna let you, I don't wanna let you
I don't wanna let you go

[Verse 2]
I used to dream out loud
I used to midnight dance
Lost a couple lovers
Lost my common sense
Though the water rises
Though the bridges burn
I know that I can love again
'Cause of you I learned

[Pre-Chorus + Chorus x2]

[Outro]
I wish tomorrow would come a little slower
Wish that you would come a little closer tonight
Just for tonight

[Verse 1]
Bow my head as I hold you close
As we tune in to the radio
The saddest storm is coming our way
And the world could end tomorrow
It's now another moment goes to waste
And if we don't see the light of day
I love you more than words can say
But I think by now you know

[Pre-Chorus]
And if this whole world's fading away
Tonight is the last night that we'll be safe
Let's your head down to your side
Tonight is the greatest goodbye
Lord knows I'll keep you right by me
Jesus tell us, was this all part of your plan

[Chorus]
Crushing, burning to the earth
Hold you tight even if it's hurts
Our mind raise back and forth baby when I
Our souls collide, our souls collide
Our souls collide, our souls collide

[Verse 2]
I spiraled down, 'twas the flames of Hell
You rise above, far from where I fell
You were always such a angel
And I always played with fire
If I don't get the chance to see your pretty face
I hope that you'll remember everyone word I say
Love you more than words can say
But I think by now you know

[Pre-Chorus + Chorus]

[Bridge]
If this is all world is fading away
Tonight is the last night that we'll be safe
Let's your head down to your side
Tonight is the greatest goodbye

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Now she wanna fuck with me (fuck with me)
Live a life of luxury, models in my money trees
Such beautiful company
Fuck a 9 to 5 I’m seeing dollar signs
But I'm still driving around in my old whip, still living at home
Got issues with my old chick, she blowin' up my phone hot
Talkin ‘bout some old shit, like who’s this, who’s that
Could be worse, so to calm her nerves
I just tell her

[Hook 1]
Roll up an L and light it, let’s go to space
Be my co, I’ll be the pilot, let’s get away
Let’s get away, let’s get away
Let’s get away, baby let’s get away

[Hook 2]
If money doesn't fall from trees
Maybe we can make believe today
All I need is company
And rest assured, I got it babe

[Verse 2]
Working for the finer things (finer things)
Getting in all kind of ways, pennies all in my champagne
Every day we celebrate (celebrate)
Fuck your little funds, a million ain't enough
But I'm still driving around in my old whip, still living at home
Got, issues with my new chick, she blowin’ up my phone hot
All I hear is womp womp, womp womp (womp womp)
But it could be worse, girl, calm your nerves
I want you to

[Hook 1]
Roll up an L and light it, let’s go to space
Be my co-, I’ll be the pilot, let’s get away
Let’s get away, let’s get away
Let’s get away, baby let’s get away

[Hook 2]
Money doesn’t fall from trees
Maybe we can make believe today
All I need is company
And the rest is yours, I promise babe
If money don’t...

[Intercom]
B 31 through 60, B 31 through 60 welcome on aboard

[Verse 1: Janelle Monáe and Syd]
Lately when I look into your eyes
I see indefinite trouble
Darlin’ as much as I’d love to try
I can't help but feel so far from you
Yet I’m in the terminal
This probably looks so typical
I probably should be going home
But you make me want to stay
And I love your visual
So let’s just keep it digital
But baby can you break me off before I fly away oh

[Hook: Janelle Monáe and Syd x2]
Gabby (let me tell you something)
Gabby (listen when I’m talkin’ to you)
Gabby (things I wish we could’ve done)
Gabby (are you listenin’ to me?)
Gabby (better pay attention ‘cause I)
Gabby (‘cause I wanted you to be the one) (the one)
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it. This bitch talkin’ ‘bout she can’t even come now. Talkin’ ‘bout her niggas found out about us talking and like, she can’t meet up like

[Verse 2: Syd]
Back seat, take it, seat belt, time to fasten it
Gabby’s waiting and it’s a trip to me
That I’m still in this terminal
And what I'm lookin’ for, it isn’t at the gate
So I told TSA my ticket’s fake, I’m on parole
So you should send me home before I make a mistake

[Hook: Janelle Monáe and Syd]
Gabby (let me tell you something)
Gabby (listen when I’m talkin’ to you)
Gabby (things I wish we could’ve done)
Gabby (are you listenin’ to me?)

And the one la la la la la
And the one la la la la la
And the one la la la la la

[Outro: Syd]
Sucks that you run away, walk away
I wanted you to be the one
Be the one
Be the one (to choose?)
Da da dum yeah yeah
Shut up, Janelle
Shut up

[Verse 1]
I woke up impatient and anxious
Chasin’ dreams in my sleep
Got me feeling like I made it
Then I wake up and see
Frustration tracing for payment
Thankfully they know me
Can’t get enough of the paper (Get enough of the paper)

[Pre-Hook]
I know you love it, babe, ‘cause I’m a risk
But if you put it on, Imma win
And if you give it to me, I won’t forget
When I'm a legend, baby, and we’re all rich

[Hook]
I need you to know
It’s under control, I got it
And as it unfolds, I got you, I promise
I promise I’m on it

[Verse 2]
I can’t help but feel like I'm wastin’ precious time in my life
Worrying about my behaviors, sometimes I think I’m too nice
I know I’m destined for greatness, fuck a critic’s advice
They hatin’ ‘cause I’m a player (they hatin’ ‘cause I’m a player)

[Pre-Hook]
I know you love it, babe, ‘cause I’m a risk
But if you put it on, Imma win (Imma)
And if you give it time, I won’t forget (I won’t forget)
When I'm a legend, baby, and we’re all rich

[Hook]
I need you to know
It’s under control, I got it (I got it)
And as it unfolds, I got you I promise
I promise I’m on it

[Bridge]
When it’s all said and done
Send my love on, oh
You know I’m tellin’ you the truth
When I say I’ll take care of you
Yeah, yeah

[Interlude]
You know, it get rough sometime

[?]

[Hook]
But look, I need you to know (it can only get better from here)
It’s under control, I got it (I got it, babe)
And as it unfolds, I got you, I promise
I promise I’m on it
I need you to know
It’s under control, I got it
And as it unfolds, I got you, I promise
I promise I’m on it

I don’t love you no more (Rock babe)
I don’t love you no more (Rock babe)
I don’t love you no more (Rock babe)
I don’t love you no more (Rock babe)

[Verse 1]
Used to be you and me, young and in love
Honestly used to think love was enough
Tell me who I gotta be to get you out from under me
Don't need you all up under me
I already moved on
Was in love with you for too long

[Pre-Hook]
Yeah, I’m just sayin’
Yeah, I’m just sayin’, girl
I’m not trying to hurt your feelings
But I gotta say it, girl

[Hook]
(You fucked up) Now I don't even want you
Can’t believe I wrote another song about you
(You fucked up) You made another mistake
Now you know that I’m not the type that you can replace
(You fucked up) Now I don’t even want you
And I noticed that I’m better off without you
(You fucked up) Now that I got some cash flow
And I have everything that I’ve ever asked for
(You fucked up)

[Verse 2]
You’re talkin’ like you got a shot, changin’ my mind
But I know better than that, you’re wasting your time
Tell me what it gotta be to get you out from under me
Don't need you all up under me
I already moved on
Was in love with you for too long

[Pre-Hook]
Yeah, I’m just sayin’
Yeah, I’m just sayin’, girl
I’m not trying to hurt your feelings
I gotta say it, girl

[Hook]
(You fucked up) Now I don't even want you (no)
Can’t believe I wrote another song about you
(You fucked up) You made another mistake
Now you know that I’m not the type that you can replace
(You fucked up) Now I don’t even want you
And I noticed that I’m better off without you
(You fucked up) Now that I got some cash flow
And I have everything that I ever asked for

[Outro]
(You fucked up)
(You fucked up)
(You fucked up)
Look, don’t be calling on my phone no more, please

I don’t love you no more
I don’t love you no more
I don’t love you no more
I don’t love you no more
I don’t love you no more
I don’t love you no more

Part 2: I Tried

[Verse 1]
Got a letter from an old flame the other day
Envelope, had a scent reminiscent of May
Said she’s doing just fine, that I’ve been on her mind and
That she wishes that I never ever went away
I gave it all I had just to let it go
But you should know that I tried

[Hook]
I tried, I tried
I tried, just know that I tried
That I tried, I tried
I tried

[Verse 2]
Got a call from an old friend the other night
He said that he just saw you, and you’re living the life
We were always best friends
It all came to an end and things change
One day I hope you realize

[Hook]
I tried, I tried
I tried, I tried
Girl, I tried, yeah, I tried
I tried, I tried

[Bridge]
Maybe one day we’ll find common ground
When the weather’s warm and the trees are green
Maybe when the leaves start falling
Maybe then we’ll find ourselves together again

[Verse 3]
That’s it, my seeds are there in your garden
I fell in love with smoke and mirrors
The spring, I guess we’ll see if we blossom
Or are we just fallen petals? Is it autumn?

[Outro]
Maybe one day we’ll find common ground
When the ocean’s cold and the pigs all fly
Maybe when the sky starts falling

[Verse 1]
Speedin’ in a black Jeep, headed to the freeway
If anybody slows down, it’s a problem
Kilos in the backseat, million in the briefcase
Yo, if anybody finds out, Imma rob ‘em

[Hook]
Maybe I can say I've made some mistakes in the past
But this is today, not a care in the world
Just me and my girl, it’s okay
I welcome the rain

[Bridge]
Oh I gave you all the storm that you could weather
One day can turn into forever
And who would’ve thought we’d end up on the run, the run

[Interlude]
Just put your foot on the gas now, go, go, go
Aye, promise this’ll be the last time

[Verse 2]
Beatin’ down the backstreets, feelin’ like a street race
Won’t let a nigga find out, there’s some cops on the way
Done a lot of bad deeds, but tryna live easy
Partner right beside me, try to stop us

[Hook]
Maybe I can say I've made some mistakes in the past
But this is today not a care in the world
Just me and my girl, it’s okay
I welcome the rain

[Bridge]
You stood beside me through the stormy weather
You know one little storm could last forever
And who would’ve thought we’d end up on the run, the run

[Outro]
If we ever get away, I’ll be sure
Sure not to make the same mistakes as before
I know you would die for me, won’t you babe?
You already ride for me, don’t you babe?

[Verse 1]
Did you see the news last night?
They shot another one down
Does it even matter why?
Or is it all for nothing?

[Hook]
Father who art in heaven
Is this how you saw it when you made your creation?
Is this what you wanted?
Is this what you wanted?

[Interlude]
Maybe we’ll never know
Or maybe we’ll find paradise in the sky when we die
When we die
When we die, yeah

[Verse 2]
Took her to the moon last night
Little bit of weed, a little wine
Left everything else behind
No plans on coming home

[Hook]
Father who art in heaven
This is what you’ve started, it’s your creation
Is this what you wanted?
Is this what you wanted?

[Bridge]
Rather watch the world burn down
From a penthouse cloud, real talk
But if this is what you want, I’ll fight ’til the
Smoke-filled skies make the days turn night, then what?
Maybe when the world burns down
And the clouds turns black
And the sky turns white
And the days turn night
It’s a war outside
It’s a war outside
It’s a war outside

[Outro]
Or maybe we’ll find paradise in the sky
When we die
When we die, yeah

[Beat Change]
Part 1

[Verse]
It’s a full tank in the getaway, get away
So before I break your heart, you should get the engine started
There’s nothing like a nice drive in the Summertime
Sunshine with the groove goin’ to help you move on
So get a move on, get your mood right maybe start a new life

[Pre-Hook]
And you’re wondering
What to do and where to go
Tell me not to do it, babe
I don’t feel the same about you anymore

[Hook]
Don't get caught up lovin' me
I know it don't make sense
You’re perfect on paper, baby
But something’s missing
Don’t get caught up lovin' me
Girl, I’m no good for you
It has nothing to do because it’s just another season

[Interlude]
I don’t wanna be without you, babe
I don’t wanna be without you, babe
I don’t wanna be without you, babe
I don’t wanna be without you, babe

[Bridge]
I just think I’m way too young to fall in love
Sign of the times I guess
Maybe in another season
Imma be trying to find someone like you

[Interlude]
Don’t get caught up lovin’ me
Don’t get caught up lovin’ me

[Bridge]
I just think I’m way too young to fall in love
Sign of the times I guess
Maybe in another season
Imma be trying to find someone like you

[Intro]
Huh, bur

My bitch had an abortion
Voices in my head saying buy more Rolls Royces
Drop top Porsches

Riding red Bentley red
Robbing in my black tee and now I'm tricking in my Louis shots
2 bricks and I bought her, when she lying I made her shit it out

[?] jury can't even get it out
Gucci Mane, Tom Petty
12 Ferraris, wanna rent 'em out
And no I can not dance like Omarion
But I'm standing ten toes with the tommy gun
Make a nigga call Louis his whole crew up
Ain't gon' stop shooting til the whole clip is done

[Hook x2]
My young niggas tote cakes for me
My young niggas gon' spray for me
Hope you don't disagree with me
Cuz my young nigga gon' shoot for me

My young niggas tote cakes for me

[Produced by Pharrell Williams & Sounwave]

[Intro]
Alls my life I has to fight, hittas

Hard times like, "Yeah!"
Bad trips like, "Yeah!"
Nazareth, I'm on one
Homie you on one
But if God got us

Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

[Verse 1]
Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut
But homicide be lookin' at you from the face down
What Mac-11 even boom with the bass down
Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty uh, uh is the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her but this what I like, Lord knows
20 of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Everything I sow, so my karma come
And heaven no preliminary hearing, so my record
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say?

[Pre-Chorus]
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Hitta, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go?"
Hitta, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo' sho'
Hitta, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

[Verse 2]
What you want, you a house, you a car?
A piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Look, you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every little zero
Thinkin' of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal
Diggin' in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Everyday my logic, get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico... ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I sequel
If I got it then you know you got it, heaven, I can reach you
Pet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog, that's all
Pick back and chat, I trap the back for y'all
I rap, I black on track so rest assured
I right my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with God

[Pre-Chorus]
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Hitta, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go?"
Hitta, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo' sho'
Hitta, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]

No releasing me, I got the piece in me, I gotta
Keep the decency and make them TNT my product

(Alright)
Fourteen years old sound so raw making plays home boy
Big K's and my big dogs
Never, ever, went straight home, boy
(Alright)

Pull up in the U-Haul with 2,000 pints

Got 2 mill on me right now like born with it

[Part 1]
Bowie's in space, Bowie's in space
Whatcha doin' out there, man?
That's pretty freaky Bowie
Is it cold out in space, Bowie?
Do you want to borrow my jumper, Bowie?

Does the space cold
Make your nipples go pointy, Bowie?
Do you use your pointy nipples as telescopic antennae
To transmit data back to Earth?
I betcha do, you freaky old bastard you

Hey Bowie, do you have one really funky sequined space suit
Or do you have several ch-changes?
Do they smoke grass out in space, Bowie
Or do they smoke Astroturf, ooh?

Receiving transmission
From David Bowie's nipple antennae
Do you read me, Lieutenant Bowie?
I said do you read me, Lieutenant Bowie?

[Part 2]
This is Bowie to Bowie
Do you hear me out there, man?
This is Bowie back to Bowie
I read you loud and clear, man, ooh yeah man

Your signal's weak on my radar screen
How far out are you, man?
I'm pretty far out
That's pretty far out, man

Ooh ah ooh, I'm orbiting Pluto, ooh ah ooh
Drawn in by its groovitational
(Groovitational pull)
I'm jamming out with the Mick Jaggernauts
And they think it's pretty cool, man

[Part 3]
Are you okay Bowie?
What was that sound?
I don't know man
I'll have to turn my ship around

Ooh, it's the craziest thing
Yeah, I'm picking it up on my LSD screen
But can you see the stratosphere, ringing?
To the choir of Afronauts singing
Bowie's in space

[Part 4]
Bowie's in space
Bowie, Bowie, Bowie, Bowie, Bowie, Bowie

Bowie, Bowie, Bowie, Bowie, Bowie, Bowie

Eeniee ma ma meenie miny moey
Phasers on funky

[Verse 1: Syd]
Cigarettes and sex are on your breath again
It's cool, I'm the same, the way we kiss
Girl you’re special, I wanna protect you and I’ll kill so you could live
But when the first body went down, you wouldn't tell me that I know it again
I'd rather lay it down and get back cuz killin' is a sin
We're chillin' instead, give me a kiss
Girl

[Chorus: Syd]
If not for me
For the world

[Verse 2: Syd & James Fauntelroy]
False arrest, unrest, was on the docket
It’s cool, at least that’s what CNN says
Girl you’re special, I wanna protect you and I’ll kill so you could live
But when the last body goes down, it won’t make any sense
I’d rather lay you back, down on your back, than killin' and shit
Chillin' and shit, give me a kiss
Girl

[Chorus: Syd]
If not for me
For the world
If not for me
For the world
For the world

[Outro: Syd]
Just do it like ya love me babe
Do it like ya love me babe
Don't you wanna love me babe
Aw Yeah
Just do it like ya love me babe
Do it like ya love me babe
Do it like ya love me babe
Aww Yeah!
Do it like ya love me babe
Do it like ya love me baby

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I keep a MAC-11 on my fucking seat
Can't let them beat me up like Rodney King
I used to have a dream something like doctor King
Bought a Mac 90 with a fucking beam
Cuz these niggas killing for the letter B
These young niggas killing for the letter C
These young niggas killing for the letter P
These young niggas killing for the letter V

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I got money, pounds and bullets like my nigga Wee
I put my faith in God, I know he believe in me
R.I.P. my nigga Dunk, I see you in my sleep
Remember when I used to sell like 50 bricks a week
I got some shooters and my shooters don't shoot at the knee
If you get caught with all that 3 don't say you copped from me
They gave my nigga 30 year, couldn't even cop for plea
You wanna take it to the street, we can keep it street
I grab a nigga in the street, they found him on the beach
The richest street nigga living, go call Robin Leach
I straight ace sittin' on sixes with a Georgia peach
Now reverend run you better run, I practice what I preach
I knew that I could never teach or be the damn police

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I keep a MAC-11 on my fucking seat
Can't let them beat me up like Rodney King
I used to have a dream something like doctor King
Bought a Mac 90 with a fucking beam

These young niggas killing for the letter P
These young niggas killing for the letter V

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
T5DOA, I'm back up on the street
Probably blowing sour cuz ain't nothing sweet
I show you my power if you fuck with me
If you dead in an hour, that's just what it be
For the love of me
Killing for the letters, better get your cheddar
Cuz it usually gets worse, before it gets better
I ain't a body shooter, I'm what you call a "header"
And I hope they remember you, cuz I'm tryna forget ya
You ain't even gotta flex, I'm still tryna stretch ya
Prayin' ain't gon' help you, just hope I don't catch ya
Stay the fuck out of my way, that's all I suggest ya
They killin' for the letter P, yeah that's that pressure

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I keep a MAC-11 on my fucking seat
Can't let them beat me up like Rodney King
I used to have a dream something like doctor King
Bought a Mac 90 with a fucking beam

These young niggas killing for the letter P
These young niggas killing for the letter V

[Verse 3: Fetty Wap]
Young niggas drilling everything they see
Young niggas juuging just to fucking eat
Young niggas dying screaming "rest in peace"
It's a cold, cold world in these fucking streets
It's a lot of young niggas that just love to beef
40 with the drum, nigga, I can't wait to squeeze
When you see the Zoo comin', watch these niggas freeze
Young niggas getting money, money all I see
All I do is hear money, money all I free
It's a smooth 50k in these Robin jeans
It's a Zoovier with Gucci Mane,  the fuck you mean?
I'm a young nigga living out my fucking dreams
SQUAD!

Don't strategize now, nigga, it's too late, let's go!

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I got my main bitch, that's probably all I need

Okay we fuck up the city, we hit the town and we dip

You ever catch me in Philly, I'm rolling around in a six

But if you know me, you know I'm fly as a pilot could get
The plane big as a crib, I got my squad in this bitch
I got my main in this ho, I got my side on this bitch
I'm thirty thou in the air trying to decide what to hit

[Chorus: Jeremih]

Standing on this Wraith, do the Shmoney dance
Rollie on the left, thirty in the other hand

Trying to creep up in you window just like Bruh Man
Where the money? Hundred bands
Fuck nigga, you will never understand
I got bitches overseas popping pussy
Sucking dick and turning up way in Belize, nigga please
Got a main bitch, I got a side bitch

You see my chain glist, that cost me five bricks
Cause I be makin' diamonds flashing, make her eyes twitch

[Chorus: Jeremih]

[Intro: Meek Mill]
I pray to God man that we ball for a hundred summers
You know me, I did it for my niggas man
And I want everything my niggas want
You feel me?

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I want everything my niggas want
Except for the hoes they fucking
But if they happen to fuck my hoes
Then I fuck their hoes and it's nothing
Cause we all living life and we stuntin'
My niggas was there when they wasn't
And these bitches be there when you buzzing
And now that we here all these bitches be fucking
And all of a sudden these niggas be hating
They told me I never would make it
My niggas was down when these niggas was faking
Now we run the town and they mad that we made it
But we wasn't mad when these niggas was on
Fuck y'all thought we was doing
When I was putting in all that time
Grind hard nigga you gon' shine
Like a diamond in the sky
And these words I can't describe
How I miss my niggas that died
I'll war with the reaper to see them two times
My brother's my keeper, it's never two sides
It's DC or nothing nigga
And all these haters screaming fuck us
Cause they hoes fucking with us

[Chorus: August Alsina]
I gon' ride with my niggas
Even if a nigga ball or fall
I know I'mma be alright with my niggas
If we keep grinding, tell 'em where to buy me or find me
Everything my niggas want
I want everything, I want everything
I want everything my niggas want, everything
I want everything, I want everything
And I want everything my niggas want, everything
I want everything, I want everything
I want everything my niggas want
Everything my niggas want, I want everything

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
I want everything my niggas want
Buy a foreign, give my nigga one
Hundred thou, give my sister some
Bought momma crib, get her a bigger one
This year for my day ones
That stayed down when we ain't get to run
Flying jet and fucking hoes
Everybody can't get to come
Everybody can't be the boss
Keep your head up, you gon' see the stars
Put your head down, you gon' see the ground
On the tour, they got to see me now
All this food, they got to eat it now
What all you haters forgot?
What you forgot that I paid all my dues?
I was like twenty, I purchased a watch
Back when I prayed to God to get a brick, nigga
Prayed to God to be a rich nigga
Prayed to God to get the brand new Rollie
All flooded on my wrist, nigga
Timing is everything
I love all my niggas and my family is loyal
I'm buying them everything
Put Papi through college and everything

[Chorus: August Alsina]
I gon' ride with my niggas
Even if a nigga ball or fall
I know I'mma be alright with my niggas
If we keep grinding, tell 'em where to buy me or find me
Everything my niggas want
I want everything, I want everything
I want everything my niggas want, everything
I want everything, I want everything
And I want everything my nigga want, everything
I want everything, I want everything
I want everything my nigga want
Everything my niggas want, I want everything

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
All of my niggas is all of my niggas
I swear we won't fall out for money or hoes
All of my niggas is all of my niggas
We busting them down if they come by the load
Down by the code
Get it, you flip it, you bag it, you add it, divide it, subtract it
You niggas is spending your cop money profit
The fuck is you doing? Hustling backwards

[Outro: Meek Mill]
How you gon' get money like that? I just talked to my nigga on the phone
"He said, Meek Milly, you did for the team again"
We gon' ball for a hundred motherfuckin' summers
One time for the Chasers

[Intro: DJ Holiday]

I treat this dough like food, I hula-hoop producer cut the soup
I got mad at the world so I said fuck the world and fuck the room

A private plane with Gucci Mane, these hoes high as the altitude

RIP to Pimp C, cause UGK still my favorite group

[Hook: Gucci Mane]

And he can't even hear fool

[Chorus]
Got my mind right, now I run through the streets

I swear to God man I ride with that Tommy I roll out the pound, not an onion
I swear to God man my diamonds they come from New York and yo shit looking sunny
You come with them Backwoods that shit better be wrapped up like a muhfucking mummy
My brothers on bitches, my brothers on bitches
We catch em and cut them lil' bitches
I ride with the semi, my money's no midget
Got pints and my muhfuckin' reefer
Got ‘scale on my plane and it came cross that water
I locked up the safe but it's not out of order
Bitches they wan' know what's popping, they know that if I pop it they know that she droppin'
Come off the top just like Eddie Hardy, and they know I bang red like a flower
I'm not a christian, I don't go to church, but my front pockets look like a Bible
Comin' up listenin' to my raps, I knew I needed one shot like a sniper

[Chorus]
Got my mind right, now I run through the streets

I might make it, Mayweather, just like TMT, ya digg?

I really wanna meet her no damn ticket
I would love to meet her, I would love to meat her
I would love to feast her, I would love to eat her
I would love to treat her, I would love to trick her
Yeah, all of the above no pistol
This shit is serious, Brian Nichols
She so delirious, now I miss her
I'm slick the bomb like a damn missile
Bubble gum booty delicious
She got her tongue pierced
It's a done mission
I'm on a Dom Pérignon mission
Leave a pussy nigga soul lifted
Geeked out, get my toes pierced
Ri-ribbit like a toad listening
Big nose Pinocchio bitch
IPhone, she cordless
I got big diamonds in my watch
Newer Flava Flav clock
Be the first nigga cop that drop then pull straight up to the block (Skrr skrr)

[Chorus]
Got my mind right, now I run through the streets
I might take flight, don't care if it's he or she

Well, it's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby
I think I want to marry you
Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares baby
I think I wanna marry you

[Verse 1]
Well I know at little chapel by the boulevard that we can go
No one will know oh oh oh
Come on, girl
Who cares if we're trashed, got a pocket full of cash we can blow
Shots of patron
And it's on, girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't say no, no, no, no-no
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah
And we'll go, go, go, go-go
If you're ready, like I'm ready

[Chorus]
Cause it's a beautiful night
We're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby
I think I want to marry you
Is it the look in your eyes
Or is it this dancing juice?
Who cares baby
I think I wanna marry you

[Outro]
I'll go get a ring let the choir bells sing like oh
So what you want to do?
Let's just run girl

[Verse 1]
You stripped your love down to the wire
Fire shy and cold alone outside
You stripped it right down to the wire
But I see you behind those tired eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Now as you wade through shadows that live in your heart
You'll find the light that leads home
Cause I see you for you and your beautiful scars
So take my hand, don't let go

[Chorus]
Cause it's not too late, it's not too late
I, I see the hope in your heart
And sometimes you lose and sometimes you're shooting
Broken arrows in the dark
But I, I see the hope in your heart

[Verse 2]
I've seen the darkness in the light
The kind of blue that leaves you lost and blind
The only thing that's black and white
Is that you don't have to walk alone this time

[Pre-Chorus]
We have to tear down walls that live in your heart
To find someone you call home
Now you see me for me and my beautiful scars
So take my hand, don't let go

[Chorus]
Cause it's not too late, it's not too late
I, I see the hope in your heart
And sometimes you lose and sometimes you're shooting
Broken arrows in the dark
But I, I see the hope in your heart

[Outro]
It's not too late, it's not too late
I see the hope in your heart
Sometimes losing, sometimes shooting
Broken arrows in the dark

[Intro: Matisyahu]
Oh
Go-go-go, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1: Matisyahu]
Papa, he was gone tryna make a dime
Mama kept us warm when there was no sunshine
I was busy building up a reputation
Did a lot of things out of desperation
Back up on my feet, got the motivation
Now I found my faith and a good vibration

[Refrain: Matisyahu]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Yeah)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Yeah)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Yeah, eh-eh-eh

[Pre-Chorus: Matisyahu]
Search for you, love of creation
When you're feeling down in this place, just replace them
Keep a vision on the one you've been chasing
When the time comes we'll run to the station
We've been laced with the powers of creation
So when the sun sets, you bet you must face them
Remember when we were running 'cross the nation
We were living for the here and now

[Chorus: Matisyahu]
You can't catch me
I'll be gone by the time they come
You can't catch me
The war is already won
Even though the children have sold their guns
We must remember the fallen ones
Remember the fallen ones, yeah
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2: Wyclef Jean, Matisyahu]
Raised in the capital of Port-au-Prince
Born with them pillars and them tenements
Papa used to run from the immigration
When we got to the United Station
A teen under pressure, got to blend in
Before the guitar I had a Mac 10
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Yeah)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Eh)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus: Wyclef Jean]
Thanks for you, love of creation
When you're feeling down in this place, just replace them
Keep a vision on the one you've been chasing
When the time comes we'll run to the station
We've been laced with the powers of creation
So when the sun sets, you bet you must face them
Remember when we were running 'cross the nation
We were living for the here and now

[Chorus: Matisyahu & Wyclef Jean]
You can't catch me
I'll be gone by the time they come
You can't catch me
The war is already won
Even though the children have sold their guns
We must remember the fallen ones
Remember the fallen ones, yeah
Oh, yeah

[Verse 1]
There's nothing for the record and nothing to condemn
It's in between this waking life and REM
But you walked into the party and tell me to live up to her dreams
We 'bout to get it started, turn my guitar up so I can make this woman scream!
So I can make this woman scream!

[Verse 2]
It's time to check your cell phone, Red Bull and Patrón
Ain't no rapper tryna be a singer, gonna make her moan
Sade and Babyface:
R&B ain't got no place
Put some hard rock on, you better cover your ears
Cause you're about to hear a woman just scream!
Scream!

[Verse 3]
She said "If I don't really get to kiss you, I'm really gonna make a scene."
I said "Eww, so you just want me to be another rip in your jeans."
That's when she ordered strawberries, chocolate, and whipped cream
My guitar was all turned up
And this woman screamed, screamed, screamed, screamed, screamed

[Refrain]
She likes to party hard
She's a HardRockLover
Party hard
She's a HardRockLover now
She likes to party hard
She's a HardRockLover
Party hard
She's a HardRockLover now

[Outro]
She likes to party hard

[Verse 1]
I know you're thirsty, baby, standing in the heat
I've got the juicy fruit, those sweet peaches and cream
You wanna wet your whistle, come and have a drink (Ice cold)
Cool as a cucumber, you're coming on to me
You say, "You got the ripest melons on the street"
My honeydew and your banana make a treat

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause baby, don't you know all the boys are jelly of you?
But first comes, first serve
Don't you know that it's so delicious, yummy and new
But first comes, first serves, so bottoms up!

[Verse 2]
You'll have to count your calories when you're with me
Because my sugar gonna give you cavities
Don't wanna share me 'cause I'm such a tasty treat (Yum, yum)
I'll let you double dip it in your favorite sauce
I'll even let you eat the cherry on the top
You'll beg for seconds in a diabetic shock (What?)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause baby, don't you know all the boys are jelly of you?
But first comes, first serve
Don't you know that it's so delicious, yummy and new

I know you're sick of the Kool-Aid, I got your upgrade
One sip, you'll be salivating

Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the back, where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the back, where chocolate's made
Milk, milk, lemonade
Round the back, where chocolate's made

Pull up at yo spot, 6 deep ran in and let the motor run
Lets grow a hunnid pack and wrap em one by one just like a mummy
I love my bitch but I don't love nothing the way I love my money
Ten thousand rounds of ammo at the spot, man I wish they would
The freaks come out at night and the killas in my neck of the woods
Let my boy murk em and give em a apartment in baton rouge

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I've got the Rap Patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed
Rap critics that say he's Money, Cash, Hoes
I'm from the hood stupid, what type of facts are those
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You'd celebrate the minute you was having dough
I'm like fuck critics, you can kiss my whole asshole
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
They don't play my hits, well I don't give a shit, so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give em more cash for ads, fuckers

[Verse Two: Notorious B.I.G & Busta Rhymes]
Uhh (Check it out) uhh
Diamonds on my neck, chrome drop-top
Chillin' on the scene, smokin' pounds of green
Oooh-wee, you see, the ugliest
Money-hungriest, Brooklyn Loch Ness
Nine millimeter cock test, wan fi' test?
And the winner is...

[Busta Rhymes]
Y'all niggas know the rules
I blast on niggas so --

[Notorious B.I.G.]
-- my fist never bruise
Land-still-cruise, Frank White paid his dues
Ask who's the raw, bet they say Poppa very
Look forward to me like commissary
All of a sudden, now every-body Big Willie
Done did it, come widdit, get yo' head splitted
Or get your neck slitted, admit it, you overdid it
Your shit it, just ain't got that LOUD
Gold tooth shine like TA-DOW!
Biggie Smalls the illest and how, phrase raise your eyebrow
By now you figure, he talkin' bout that nigga
But your weak-ass assumptions, lead led to dumpin'
IV to pump-in, you're feeling something
Catch my drift, or catch my four-fifth lift
At least six inches, above project fences
Turn meat to minces, jumps turn to flinches
When I rain I drenches, cleared your park benches (HAH)
Missed you by pinches (HOO) your talk is senseless (RRUFF)
Actor needs chiropractor (HAH, HOO) for cracked jaw
Yes I rocked, you tried to box (Hah)
Dangerous you're not I gets down (HOO)
Twist your body {*singing*} round and round, upside down

[Verse Three: Busta Rhymes]
C'mon, yo, throw your hands, c'mon

Bump your fists, c'mon

Slip my ho a forty-fo' and she got in the back do'
Bitches looking at me strange but you know I don't care
Step up in this motherfucker just a-swanging my hair
Bitch quit talking, Crip walk, stay down with the set
Take a bullet with some dick and take this dope from this jet
Out of town, put it down for the Father of Rap
And if yo' ass get cracked, bitch shut yo' trap
Come back, get back, that's the part of success
If you believe in the S you'll be relieving your stress

[Bridge: 2Pac]

(Stay Hip Hop, Stay) This came from the gut, from the blood
(Stay Hip Hop, Stay) From the soul, right here, man
(I Pray Hip Hop, Pray) This is our thing, man

[Poem]
Ahhh! Ahhh!
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
Lucifer was all around
So I kept running
Until I found my safe haven
I was trying to convince myself the stripes I got
Making myself realize what my foundation was
(In the room, and I run it)
(Bluh! Bluh! Bluh! Bluh!)
But while my loved ones were fighting the continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination

[Interlude]
Ay on my momma, nigga (R.I.P. Pat Dawg)
I'mma be the greatest to ever do this shit
On my momma, doe like...
On the dead homies
Aye Sounwave turn this shit up nigga
Turn this shit up! Soundwave, turn this shit up nigga
Tell me, who the bitch nigga hatin' on me?
Jumping on my dick, but this dick ain't free
To Pimp a Butterfly, another classic CD
Ghetto lullaby for every one-day MC
(Bluh! Bluh! Bluh! Bluh!)
Nigga, now R.I.P
My diligence is only meant to write your eulogy

[Intro]
Alls my life I has to fight, nigga
Alls my life I...
Hard times like, "God!"
Bad trips like, "Yea!"
Nazareth, I'm fucked up
Homie, you fucked up
But if God got us
Then we gon' be alright

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

[Verse 1]
Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut
But homicide be lookin' at you from the face down
What Mac-11 even boom with the bass down
Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her but this what I like, Lord knows
20 of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Reapin' everything I sow, so my karma come
And heaven no preliminary hearing, so my record
I'm a motherfuckin' gangster in silence for the record
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say

[Pre-Chorus]
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go?"
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright

[Chorus]
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

[Verse 2]
What you want, you a house, you a car?
40 acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every little zero
Thinkin' of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal
Diggin' in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Everyday my logic, get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico... ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I sequel
If I got it then you know you got it, heaven, I can reach you
Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, my dog, that's all
Bick back and Chad, I trap the bag for y'all
I rap, I black on track so rest assured
My rights, my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with God

[Pre-Chorus]
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go?"
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright

[Chorus]
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

[Outro]
I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid, a lot of changes
I'm alright, and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers

[Poem]
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Focus

Focus can be the difference between on and off
Winning and losing
Good and great
Between great and the best

Focusing could be the most self-fulfilling thing you could do for yourself because with focus comes accomplishment
Focusing could bring out your greatest talents and give you true purpose in this world
It can take your natural ability and magnify it to extraordinary
One thing I learned and I'm sure most of us know is what you focus on
What you put your energy into
Is exactly what we should expect back
That's just the law of the universe

Karma
I seen it happen like 10,000 times
It is proven that 1+1 being two

Focus is the key to being successful in any situation
If you focus on the wrong, you'll get the wrong things
There's no way to focus on one thing and expect something different
How you focus on something is giving attention to it
Even if you don't like it and still focus on not liking it, you're still putting your attention to it and will still attract it
For example, if you focus on wanting a new car, you'll keep attracting the idea of wanting a new car
But it is easy to confuse that, because wanting a new car isn't the way to manifest it
You're simply just wanting a new car and not obtaining a new car
Remember, the intent of your focus is so important
There's a difference between focusing on wanting a new car and focusing on a car being yours
We really should be clear on what we focus on

Honestly, I feel like time is the most valuable thing we have ever been given and focus runs parallel to that
Because every second of the day we're focused on something, whether you realize it or not
I for sure am a victim of focusing on the wrong things sometimes
I spent a little too much time on my phone looking at comments, focusing on how it'd feel a little too long
But that's just human

It's very rare that you'd probably focus on 100% of your time on what you need to
But the biggest advantage is to quickly catch yourself and be able to reset your focus
For me, there's no way I could focus on something I don't love
At least not for long

I'm just not content with my spending my life miserable and I just personally can't live like that
It is not a party of vibration you could tell how you feel
Your inner guidance system
Your feelings
If I feel good, I'm doing the right thing
If not then it's not what I'm supposed to be doing

How does what you focus on makes you feel?
Remember, it's never too late or too early to know what makes you happy and to make that change by any means necessary
I went into my last album focused
I wanted to focus on making music that would change people's lives, help lift their moods up
Music that I felt that was undeniably great to me and talk about what directly affected me
And that's what I did
I never focused so much on executing these things while making music and what'd you know?
My first number one album and my most successful one yet
You can't measure success by anything but happiness
I say that all the time
And if you focus your energy on what makes you happy
What do you think will happen?
Exactly
It always work out

Rewire any thoughts you had prior and know that you are what you focus on

Focus

Shouts out to Little Slugger
He'll spit a wing for ya

[Chorus: Young Thug]
In the streets niggas say what's the word on 'em
Nothin' much, know that I’m worthy, homie
We in the new Bentleys with the birdies on 'em

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I think I'm scared of the dark, so I wear glasses at night

Fuck her with the lights on, fuck her with my ice on

Guwop and the rap Breezy, that's a nice Versace tandem
The fact that I ain't won a Grammy, yup I'm gettin' robbed
When Gucci Mane get out, I might sign with Bricksquad 1017
Part of triple beam, triple beam dreams
Checkin' the block like Hakeem, I can Scott Skiles
100K just for me to crack a smile
Aw shit, look who it is, it's the white Berry Smalls
Maybe show my swift, diamonds on my stick shift

[Hook: Gucci Mane]

Old dead people dancin' in my pocket Rasputia's Granny

Young Thug nuttin' everywhere, gotta buy some panties
Tuck my napkin in my shirt, mob boss manners
Nasty bitches can't stand me
Caught my bitch clean like an empty house attic

Fuck a cell, I'm payin' in a cash bond
And you gettin' bunned if you don't got them cash funds
Servin' on the block can take off when crash comes
And right back to the block just like we left somethin'

So every single night I smoke one for my homeboys

In love with the alphabet, I married the K

[Verse 3: Ca$h Out]
Got goons on go, not friendly, bitch

Hundred bricks on the road the birds flock together
Put some change on your head, call me "Money" Mayweather
And nigga I can show you how to pick a feather
Half a brick to a whole thing, remix, put it back together
And I got my Adidas on, but I got more stripes
And what these niggas rappin' bout, hey man that's your life

And if I turned this four into a nine it'd be so right

[Chorus: Young Thug]

[Intro: YL Stunna]
Uh, as the blunt slowly burns
I pass through Cleveland the point of no return
And if you make it out alive, don't return
Let me fly free, man, fuck a urn
Smoke my ashes, taste my dust
This shit was really easy like fuckin' two sluts
And this money on my mind so I ain't fucked in two months
And when it comes down to a bitch, I don't be carin' too much (Swamp Izzo)
Where ever ya'll at, we above that
Lord knows I hope the Feds bring my plug back
ROC Crew, TJ said, what's poppin', 5ive?

[Chorus: Young Thug]

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Oh, and I'll just beat you like an instrumental
We go harder than y'all

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
You ain't living how I live sucka
That's why I flex on niggas they never did love us
I'm putting checks on niggas even my kid's mother
And you ain't real if you gon' let them kids suffer
Niggas killed your cousin and you ain't did nothing
Expect run to the cops and tell them pigs something
Thirty two in my Glock I'm trying to bend something
I could murder these niggas like I'mma win something
But they don't make war for that
There's friends with double edge knives putting swords to back
Velour is black, Balenciagas on I'm strapped
I put my dawgs onto money and on the map
You want to see me extending my hand that boy's a rat
And I don't party in them clubs where informants at
Cause they watching, and the listening
And they plotting with they people they whispering

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
It don't get no realer
Sixteen with a body he a killer
Running around with a stick like Donatello
Man these niggas out to murder for that chedder
I'mma tryna tell ya niggas scheme for that green paper
Hommies killing hommies over fiend paper
Hommies killing hommies over leaned paper

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
There should be the real nigga Grammys
Where we buy  Rollies and treat them like trophies
You'll never understand me
You ain't come where I come from
Niggas on Xannies, mommy on crack how we going to feed the family
Might as well start selling it, everybody inhaling it
Young, black, and intelligent what they should have been telling us
But they was locking us in a cell with a stranger for them to raise us and wonder why we rebellious
Niggas going through pain
I was missing from school cause I was going through things
Now I'm getting this money feel like I'm going through change
Niggas driving me crazy they threw it all for the fame

[Verse 4: Meek Mill]
Money ain't the root of all evil its attention now
Knocking down schools in my city to bring a prison 'round
They killed Chinx Drugz in his own city
They killed Lil Snupe in his own city
Wonder why I don't be in my own city
I don't know if niggas gone clap for me or going to kill me
Still living lavish and they still wonder why I act savage
All these guns and automatics
Still gonna murder these niggas that want to have it
Before they have me miss my son’s football practice
Fuck y’all niggas that killed Lil Snupe
And when we run into y’all niggas we gone kill y’all too
I still pray every young nigga feel that coupe
Cause young niggas feel like me, I feel like you
Fifty shades of grey, want to do me like Freddie
I pray to god, load my chopper, tell them niggas I’m ready

[Verse 5: Meek Mill]
In the middle of the summer
In the middle of the summer
In the middle of the summer
Summertime nights out and we bring them bikes out
You could turn the lights out cause we got all this ice out
We up in here serious going crazy
Young boys getting to the 

[?]
Looking at the media they say I got a baby
On the way by Nicki I'm thinking the media crazy
Young nigga getting to the money
Dreams Worth More Than Money it ain't funny
Started from the bottom I remember I ain't have a dollar
I bought my first Impala
Then I bought a Rolls Royce cause I came up from the bottom they ain't give me no choice
Judge gave me five months in jail, felt like I was in Hell
Twenty three I was in the cell

[Verse 6: Meek Mill]
Sorry your honor if I was too arrogant, that money was staggering
They locked me PC with them trannies and rat, man that shit was embarrassing
Twenty three hours in the cell by myself, man you couldn't imagine it
They fed me some shit I wouldn't feed to my dog, man that shit was the nastiest
Can you imagine me losing my mind
Doing push ups 52 at a time
Do the whole deck just to get through the time
Just to get back to my son and get back to my mom
Cause Papi keep asking me where am I at
I told him in jail and I said I'll be back
He said when you back can you get me from school
Shit like that there turn boy to a goon
On to the graveyard its only one stop
We live fast die from gun shots
And in this lifestyle we sling dope, bust Glocks
Why you think we say fuck cops
Cause when they lock us up all the fun stop
And when the ice cream truck come it wouldn't stop
So for them little babies all the fun stops
They turn to goons and we post on the corner like a bus stop
Waiting on the state bus 'til the cuffs lock
They put shackles on us like jewelry we say fuck rocks
Cause all we ever wanted was to sell blocks
To get a little real estate to sell blocks
Until we got a little taste of cell blocks
And try to turn to God when these cells lock
Have mercy on me touch down catch a case trying to sell rock
And we didn't want to believe that Hell's hot
My mom told me you might as well stop
Cause you can't ride your weight when the wells drop
And your waters off and your bills due
And your shit stank smell like mildew
Cause you got wet all up and left there cause them little niggas done killed you

[Verse 7: Meek Mill]
In the kitchen like grandma
Put these bitches on stand by
When it come to getting this money fuck everything no playing time
If you real nigga you can't mind
Real niggas we can't die
Christian Loubs on their period cause their soles blooded like a tampon
I used to pray to God to get a brick nigga
Prayed to God to be a rich nigga
Prayed to God to get a brand new Rollie
All flooded on my wrist nigga
Timing is everything
I love all my niggas and my family is loyal
I'm buying them everything
Put Papi through college and everything

[Verse 8: Meek Mill]
I go out of my way to go out of my way
I give my momma a thousand a day
Like Benihana's we chopping the weight
Cause we get that work put the profit away
How would you feel if you came up from nothing and one hundred mil just a comma away
My youngins got youngins that got in the game
Cause we was out trapping when doctor was Dre
Rollie diamond the face
Look how I bust down the band I might slide to your and stop in the A
Hold up, look how I just took this bitch take her straight to the mall have her shopping away
Hold up, what you want some red bottoms
Balenciagas 

[?]
Shit I'm about to get some head out her
I have her twerking for a nigga that's cardio
I could kill all these rappers on audio
Video tape it and record it though
I park my whip in the handicap, why is that, cause that bitch retarded though
I could do the Bently or the Rolls call the audible
Switch it up but I probably do the Rarri though
Pick it up I forgot how that go

[Verse 9: Meek Mill]
None of you niggas put fear in my heart, we only fear going broke
And none of you niggas put fear in my heart, we cut your head by the throat
Never would hang with you suckers and rats, unless its a chair and a rope
Come in my city we live like the Mafia, and bitch I'm the head to the boat
Million dollar dreaming, really I was scheming
Feeling like a 

[?] when I'm off the lean
I said why you talking we don't back and forth with niggas I feel like I'm Venus
Nigga I fill up arenas, get on my level
Get on my level and maybe we hear all that shit that you talking
I heard you say you running the city and seen you in traffic and niggas was walking

Knock 'em out the park to the crib like a batcage
Everyday sweet, this a Saturday
Make a movie, fuck a matinee
Please do not talk about my past, babe
You were just sellin' pussy off of backpage
There's no such thing as bad bads, haters lookin' with a sadface
Hit the whip, get mad brain, ridin' 'round in the fast lane
Fuck with my nigga Guwop, North side to the East side
Tool on me like cowboys, bitch ride me like yee-haa

For the first, swing the big body Lexis
Maybe Jevon Kearse, mansion inside the mountain
Like Shawn Bradley, recline the top
Ice burg with peppermint patty
My left hand shinin' look like a pig salmon
I live the fifth subtract the Bumper Kid
I done flip more racks than that boy Mattress Max
I did the math and your bullshit ain't addin' up
I used to sip codeine from a dixie cup
All my ex girlfriend look like pixie chicks
Syrup in my soda, Jody Highroller
RiFF RAFF and Guwop came down with bricks on they shoulders
I found my new wheel in Apalachicola

[Hook: Gucci Mane]

I'm so sleepy
But it's not my bedtime

The bells, the bells
Keep me awake

[Chorus 1]
I'm a gummy bear
I stand up on a chair
And then I start to dance
To dance, to dance on the groove

I'm a gummy bear
Stand up on the chair
And then I start to dance
To dance, to dance on the groove

[Verse 2]
But I'm still sleepy
Or am I dreaming?
The bells, the bells keep ringing
But I'm awake

[Chorus 1]
I'm a gummy bear
Stand up on the chair
Then I start to dance
To dance, to dance on the groove

I'm a gummy bear
Stand up on the chair
And then I start to dance
To dance, to dance on the groove

[Verse 3]

'Cause I'm going to be dodging
In the big game
The bells, the bells keep ringing
So keep it down

[Chorus 2]
Keep it down, keep it down
Keep it down, keep it down
Keep it down, keep it down
Keep it down, keep it down
Keep it down

I'm the gummy bear

To dance, to dance on the groove

And I appear from place to place as the Music Man aka Masta Ace

[Intro]
Weed and syrup, yeah
(We got London on da Track)

[Verse 1]
All I know is paper, I don't know these hoes
I like mouth in my lap and pussy on my nose
And I'm bringin' home the bacon, it's fryin' on the stove
You hoes can't drive me crazy, keep your eyes on the road
Got the money on my mind, and bodies on my nine
And I swear every day, I'm on my Ariana grind-de
I got that yay, I got that la-di-da-di-da
And a kamikaze squad, and you chicken parmesan
Lord, I'm a free man like I come from Amistad
No, I come from Hollygrove, turnin' Os to octagons
I get money while I'm 'sleep, I dream that I'm in Heaven
I dream I saw Lil Beezy and smoked a 'gar with Wessy
All my niggas, rest in peace, and my enemy, rest pleasant
So when my niggas creep, they catch him when he least expect 'em
Mama told me "If you run these streets, run these streets correctly"
Well, feet don't fail me now; I never knew my feet to test me
Lord knows I wear new clothes to the mall
Two hoes on my arm
Fur boots when it's warm
Church shoes to play ball
I'm spittin' this shit like bird food to a dog
Urkel to big Carl, y'all don't hear me
All I love is paper, I don't love these hoes
Boy, that vest won't save you, neither will heroes
Lord, they better hope you save him, better catch the holy ghost
Holy moly, hockey mask like Halloween like OVO
Lord, all I know is strippers, all they know is poles
All they sell is pussy 'cause they been sold they soul
Boy, you go zero to sixty, I go one-and-two-zeros
Pedal to the metal, I call it rose gold
Lord, all I know is paper, big fat money rolls
Look at how big my safe is, that bitch got double doors
I was runnin' outta patience 'til I heard "All aboard"
They mad 'cause I be skatin' at home on marble floors
Lord knows I drive fast in my driveway
I pop tags and throw 'em down and make the ground shake
Goddamn, a pint of lean almost 5K
I be spendin' 25K every 5 days
I sent my girl on a spa day
'Cause Hood just came with them chickens
I don't want you in the house, bae
Plus we need the kitchen
Lord, trap house in abundance
We got trap houses in London, y'all don't hear me

[Interlude]
(We got London on da Track)

[Verse 2]
Hol' up, had to switch the flow up
Had to pour up, roll some more up
Watch me go up, my doors go up
When I show up, why you show up?
Pick my bro up, pick a O up
Hit the store up, get a soda
Get us four cups, split a four up
Then we slow up, yeah, you know us
Then we toast cups and we post up
Don't approach us, we got toasters
That's my slime, like we ghostbust
And we both bust, give no fucks
Take no stuff and take your stuff
Then ho hunt for some chocha
I know a ho who'll rock the boat
But I row her, I'm Noah, Lord
I remember when I was no one, Lord
When I couldn't find jack in no one's cards
Ms. Cita, I remember goin' in your gun drawer
Puttin' it to my chest and missin' my heart by centimeters
Oh Lord, I remember dyin' on her room floor
And wakin' up in some police's arms, he died recent
So I hope Heaven made more room for him, and I hope he see me
'Cause if he didn't save that lil boy, there'd be no Weezy
Oh Lord

'Cause this AR will not allow me to walk straight
I've come to a stage in my life
And I just can't let my life boo me off stage, no
Tuxedo on and a cumberbund
Fingers crossed behind my back
On the corner, watching my money come

[Chorus]
'Cause I gotta get that paper, baby, that paper, baby
That paper, baby, that paper, babe
'Cause these streets fuck everybody, this game fuck everybody
Gotta get my paper, baby, my paper, baby, my paper, babe
Yeah, 'cause these hoes fuck anybody, these hoes fuck everybody
And I don't wanna do it no more, no
Hold up, bae, I don't wanna do it no more, no
Hold up, wait, I don't wanna do it no more, no
Hold up, bae, I don't wanna do it no more

[Outro]
I wear black 'cause I can't find nothing else to wear
I wear dreadlocks 'cause I can't do nothing else to my hair
I kiss you 'cause it just happen
I do what I do 'cause it gotta be done
But I guess I oughta start taking credit for something, right
(Mula)
Yesterday, I met a woman on the stairs that wasn't there
She wasn't there again today
I really hope she go away
(These hoes fuck anybody, these hoes fuck anybody
And I don't wanna do it no more)
'Cause you know, sometimes "at last" doesn't happen at first (Yeah)
I'm the pimp and the problem (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
She said, "You don't think of me when I know you think too much"
Hmm (I don't wanna do it no more)
(These hoes fuck anybody, these hoes fuck everybody)
(And I don't wanna do it no more)
She said "I think you think I think you think of us," hmm
(I'ma get this paper, baby, I'ma get this paper, baby)
She said she wanted sprinkles, I said sprinkles are for winners
Free Weezy
Mula

[Intro: Sample]
Dead, he's dead, he's dead, he's dead, sir
He's dead chap, that man's dead back there
It was worse than dead, his brain is gone

(Kane is in the building, nigga)

[Hook]
I never see your crazy face
Smiling, laughing, screaming my name like that
I never see your crazy face (Mula)
Smiling, laughing, screaming my name like that
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming my name
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming my name

[Post-Hook]
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead

[Verse 1]
Dead man walkin', through a dead plant garden
Red ants army, Caveman Spartan
Die, come back to life, shaved and corporate
I paved and carved it, made man forfeit
Laid and chalked him, I slaved then bossed it
I don't need flowers around my grave, I need maids and doormen
We not one and the same;
Casper the Friendly, Tunechi Cobain
Ask how I'm livin'? I can't complain
Like, it's hot in hell, but it never rain
Shit never sweet, him never changed
I'll always be the MF'er Wayne
I been lost conscious, I never regain
Bitches wanna sleep with my remains, lawd

[Bridge 1]
Them Xans got me walkin' 'round like a zombie
I just double parked the hearse by a fire hydrant
They throw flowers on my body, allergic to pollen
Rest In Peace to the Cash Money Weezy
Gone but not forgotten, no

[Hook]
I never see your crazy face
(You don't see me, nigga)
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that
(You don't see me, nigga, no)
I never see your crazy face
(You can't see me, nigga)
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that
(You can't see me, nigga, no)
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming, my name
(You can't see me, nigga, no)
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming, my name
(I'm the muthafuckin' ghost)

[Post-Hook]
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead
He's dead, he's dead, he's dead

[Verse 2]
Dead man walkin', the weed I'm sparkin'
Stank like corpses, got a young nigga coughin'
I was larger than life, should've got a bigger coffin
Bad bitches in my coffin, suck dick 'til they cough
How long will they mourn me?
I had a Rolls Royce Ghost
Now I'm feelin' like that motherfucka comin' back to haunt me
We are not one and the same;
I fumble my brain, I'm nothin' but strange
I punctured my veins, I'm loving the pain
I'm ugly and vain, now go get that shovel and dump it on Wayne
Throw dirt on my name, picture on a shirt instead of a frame
I'm dead as a doorknob and I got it locked
So fuck every key on your key chain, boy

[Bridge 2]
Them Xans got me walkin' 'round like a zombie
I don't know if I'm comin' or goin', Lord, I'm undecided
Throw flowers on my body, allergic to pollen
Rest In Peace to the Cash Money Weezy, gone but not forgotten

[Hook]
(No) I never see your crazy face (Ohhh)
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that
(You don't see me, nigga, no)
I never see your crazy face (You can't see me, nigga)
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that
(You can't see me, nigga, no, no)
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming, my name
(You can't see me, nigga, no, no)
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming, my name
(I'm the muthafuckin' ghost)
I never see your crazy face
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that
I never see your crazy face
Smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that
I see, smiling, laughing, screaming, my name like that

[Outro: Sample]
Dead, he's dead, he's dead, he's dead, sir
He's dead chap, that man's dead back there
It's worse than dead, his brain is gone

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
That's how I raised 'em, Lord
Them niggas crazy

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
D-boy, D-boy, D-boy
My pockets look Keloid
My dead Presidents reborn
When I'm naked, I got three arms
Got a big house with a green lawn
Got a cigar full of neon
Like my ho cold and my tea warm
Close his casket, he look deformed
I got bitches on my dick

[Verse 2: Euro]
I got Jays at my door
I got shooters on my team
I got Feds down my throat
Counting money, dirty and clean
Smoking nothing but Irene
Got a bitch with good hygiene
I'm sick with it, no vaccine

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I got coke under my nails
I got niggas taking them Ls
Nigga, we don't need no scale
I'm sick with it, no get well
Trigga man, trigga man, trigga man, please don't shoot
'Bout it, 'bout it, 'bout it like T-R-U
Young nigga ridin' in a V-1-2
Chop bricks like karate, judo, kung fu
Like jiu-jitsu, split a brick in two

[Verse 4: Euro]
You do you, I'ma do what it do
Niggas dropping dimes and their 2 cents too
Bout it, bout it, bout it like hoody-hoo
Started from the bottom and I grew into
Everything I'm driving is new, improved
When she fucking with me, it's a new experience
Fucking with you it's a new excuse

[Verse 5: Lil Wayne]
Nigga, who is you?
I looked in the mirror, say "Ooh, it's you"
All my goons be too enthused
So don't open your mouth like you're chewing glue
Light blue Michael Jordans, my shoe get checks like "Swoosh"
Hear you niggas talking about what you gon' do or might do
I invite you, I entice you, but I advise you not to
God bless you like "Achoo"
Police find you in the bayou
With your friends by you and your shit knocked loose
Nigga, that's what you'll get like Ken and Ryu
I been Piru, I'm in my mood
So you know what you can do?

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Fuck nigga, pull up
I'll be waiting, yeah
Fuck nigga, good luck, yeah
I'll be waiting, yeah
Fuck nigga, pull up

[Verse 6: Lil Wayne]
Fuck nigga pull up, fuck nigga pull up
I'll be waiting with my muhfuckin' foot up
I ain't even stood up, fuck nigga, good luck
Fuck nigga, put up or muhfuckin' shush up
Fuck nigga, pull up, my young niggas stood up
Like, fuck nigga, what up? Fuck nigga shook up
I been out here since P had the hook up
So if you wanna meet, nigga, I'm a butcher
If you wanna beef, nigga, I'm a butcher
My niggas wanna eat? Nigga, I'mma cook ya
If you with your bitch, and your bitch want me
Nigga, I'ma pull her like a trigger, she the bullet
We the illest, we the coolest (We the illest, we the coolest)
We the illest, we the coolest (We the illest, we the coolest)
The sickest and the smoothest, the gifted and the goofiest
Read a scripture out your movie, get a picture, I'm a-zoomin
I'ma hit 'em, I'ma lose 'em, I'ma kill 'em, I'ma bruise 'em
I'm a sinner, I'm a suitor, not to mention I'm a mover
I come at you when I'm movin', the bitch I'm with bad
I'ma pinch her on her booty, that bitch is Lil Tunechi's
Aw yeah, aw yeah, fuckin' right

[Verse 7: Euro, Lil Wayne & Both]
Always had my gun in fights
Always had the upper hand
You the always-call-your-brother type (Ooh)
Hard head all my fuckin' life (Yeah)
Whole world in my fuckin' hand (Yeah)
Damn, my girl just pulled up
With "Pull Up to My Bumper" playin'
But fuck it man, like what you sayin'?
Look, I'm not sayin', but I'm just sayin'

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Fuck nigga, pull up
I'll be waitin'
Lord knows, I'll be waitin' for you
Me and my young niggas
That's how I raised 'em

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
Fuck nigga, pull up, my young niggas stood up

I say, fuck nigga, pull up, I'm waitin' with my foot up
Fuck nigga, good luck (Blrrt, blrrt, blrrt)

[Verse 8: Lil Wayne & Euro]
I say, fuck nigga, pull up, fuck around and never pull off
They see the guns we pull out, say "Never mind" and pull off
They see the guns we pull out, say "Never mind" and keep goin'
I put the gun in his mouth and say "Be quiet and breathe soft"
Shifty eyes, I see four, flip them pies like D. Dawes
These bitches tired, they sleepwalk
Brilliant mind, I'm street smart, in deep thought
And we are what she want
And she want and he don't
But keep on and we gon' see (Yeah)

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Fuck nigga, pull up
Yeah, fuck nigga, pull up, woo
I'll be waiting, haha
Why you waiting?
Fuck nigga, pull up, fuck nigga, pull up
Fuck nigga, pull up
Yeah, I'll be waiting for you
Uh, me and my young niggas, yeah
That's how I raised 'em Lord
Them lil niggas crazy
They just waiting for me to tell 'em to go crazy, boy
What am I waiting for?

[Chorus: Jake Troth]
When this world comes crashing
And time flies right past us
Love only lasts if my heart races on
So I step on the gas, burning faster and faster
‘Cause love only lasts if my heart races on
I'm racing on, yeah, on
I'm racing on, yeah
My heart races on

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, I'm priceless
Remember me like they remember the Titans
Reality bit me, and continue to bite me
Got no degree, but where I'm from that’s the original climate
Where you can’t tell a fiend a crack rock isn’t a diamond
Hold on
Lord, if my Bugatti come to a dead-end
I've already been everywhere except Heaven
And tomorrow’s not promised
When I'm gone but not forgotten
I hope my homies calming down my mama, Lord
I guess I'll see you on that other side
Where the flowers never die the angels never lie
Yeah, the revolution will be televised
I just hope my contribution will be memorized
Lord, mama hate I got my daddy’s eyes
Never looked into my daddy’s eyes
He ain't have the time
Fuck him
The revolution will be televised
I just hope my contribution will be memorized

[Chorus: Jake Troth & Lil Wayne]
When this world comes crashing
And time flies right past us (Hold on)
Love only lasts if my heart races on (Hold on)
So I step on the gas, burning faster and faster (Hold on)
‘Cause love only lasts if my heart races on
I'm racing on, yeah (I'm gone)
On (I'm gone)
I'm racing on, yeah (I'm gone)
My heart races on

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh, Tunechi, you an angel
Must be here for a reason, and that might be the main one
Fuck it, I'm making money before making changes
I sold my soul to the devil, he bought it, then exchanged it
Fuck it, I'm working, bitch, I know you see me working
Searching for better days before a better person
I'm perfect
Just ask my bitch and she’ll say that so urgent
I purchase
My children gifts and I just keep the curses
Yeah
My heart right, and my head ain't
'Cause I'm never in my right mind
But I'm Einstein when I do think
And I grew wings
If you catch a feather, just keep it
And I’ll be racing on; no shortcuts, no cheating

[Chorus: Jake Troth & Lil Wayne]
When this world comes crashing
And time flies right past us (Hold on)
Love only lasts if my heart races on (Hold on)
So I step on the gas (Errrr)
Burning faster and faster (Hold on)
‘Cause love only lasts if my heart races on
(My heart right and my head ain't)
I'm racing on, yeah (I'm gone)
On (I'm gone)
I'm racing on, yeah
(There’s nothing left but to fly high
If you catch a feather just keep it)
My heart races on

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
This morning I woke up on my good side
Life is just a race against time so have a good time
Heart racing, thoughts racing
Competition, goodbye
I turn around and run backwards
To see what second place look like
Oh Lord, what are we running from?
The police, 'cause they already killed enough of us
Stay out them streets 'cause they don’t fuck with us
They hunting us
We in a race against racists, that’s a color run
I keep my feet above the ground
We gon' run the town
Heart racing on, beat-beat-beating, knock and pound
Love marathon, getting deeper by the mile
I see no finish line, on your mark, set, pow

[Intro]
Tunechi
Baby
(Hey!)

[Verse 1]
Uh, Lord I think I'm ballin' too hard
And my girlfriend think she too much
All she do is get pretty, I get shitfaced
Don't we make a cute couple?
To a broke heart we look like 2 bucks
I got a posse full of hitters
And a pocket full of "In God We Trust"
It's been so long since I said "It cost too much"
I'm so addicted to the fast money lifestyle
And withdrawal sucks
And dead presidents act immortal
But I know you see money's not a problem
Bal' like a butch bitch
Let's go on a shopping spree, take that shit to Goodwill
Money in a shoebox, what's up with all these shoeboxes?
Baby, I'm my own boss, "Dwayne, you gon' get you fired!"

[Hook]
But I feel good, woo
I knew that I would, yeah
I feel good, yeah
I'm smoking that good, yeah
I feel good, yeah
My girl got that good, yeah
Girl your pussy so good
And these hoes is no good
But I got you, yeah
Girl your pussy so good (so good)
And these hoes is no good (no good)
But I got you, yeah
I got you, wooo

[Verse 2]
Woo, Tunechi, baby, yeah
They say "Boy put some money aside"
Don't tell me what to do with mine
All my kids already rich, and they kids, and they kids...
They think money grow on trees
And as tall as they grew, I climbed
Knock-knock "Who's there?" Hah!
I told the bitch "It's just money"
The road can get a lil bumpy
So, on the low, I got that blow
And ya nose gon' feel like a trumpet
I'm goin home to my lil mama, she call me Big Poppa
She get hard dick and McDonald's
Cause she so tired of them Whoppers
I fuck her good, so proper, she say my name in Opera
I turn into a Piranha, then eat it like Tilapia
She know I'm going through a lot
So she say my name in Gospel
No weapon formed against Weezy shall prosper

[Hook]
And I feel good, yeah
I knew that I would, yeah
And I'm still hood, yeah
Shoutout to my hood
I was sick of stuntin'  but I feel cured
Leave yo ass in the woods, yeah
And these hoes is no good, no good
But I got a few, yeah
These hoes is no good (no good)
These hoes is no good (no good)
But, fuck it, I got you, ah
Fuck 'em I got you, ah

[Outro]
And I feel good
Tunechi, baby (Hey!)
I feel good, yeah
Woo! Like diamonds on wood
Woo, mmm, ow! yeah
I feel good, yeah
My girl got that good, yeah
Girl, your pussy so good
And these hoes is no good
But I got you, yeah
(Woaw!)

[Verse 1]
Uh, hundred thousand on a small ass chain
Hundred thousand on a bottle champagne
Half a million for a watch with no diamonds
Brought cash to the jewelers, still had change
Ooh, sharks in the crib and in the backyard
Elevator in the house, never got stuck
I just looked in the mirror, got star struck
I just looked at your bitch and got eye-fucked
Who the fuck wanna race? Put your money up
All you see is license plates far in front of ya
I gave a bad bitch a taste of the good life
She licked her lips twice and told me that I'm yummier
Glass house on the block, five floors in it
Got a picture on the wall that cost more than it
You observing it, I'm absorbing it
Judge mad 'cause a nigga make more than him
Ignoring him, I know you can't ignore the rims
I'm going in 'til I'm pouring in more than M's
I'm courtin' swimsuit models that don't know who I am
And foreign twins, I tell 'em that I star in films
My warrant's clear as day like Doris is
When I ain't trippin' then my lawyers is
So what the charges is?
Put it on my tab, baller shit
I'm from the cell to the mall with this

[Chorus]
Now tell them motherfuckers I'm
I'm post-bail ballin', post-bail ballin'
Go tell the warden I'm
I'm post-bail ballin', post-bail ballin'
Go tell the warden I'm

[Post-Chorus]
Soon as I get home, I'm go and get that brand new Bentley
And I'ma honk the horn, ridin' past the penitentiary
And I'ma drive slow, ridin' past the elementary
Then give it to my whoas, tell 'em "Don't even mention"

[Verse 2]
Uh, one time
For the hustlers and the young moms
My presidential said it's crunch time
Looking in my son's eyes
Only time I see a upside
I tell him he gon' be a tough guy
Never be a punchline
Tell him never wait in one line
Tell him not even a lunch line
Pray more than sometimes
When the cops come, you tongue-tied
Take dirt, make a mud pie
Lookin' out the window
In the coupe with a bimbo
Talking 'bout who she resemble
Bitch, you in a Enzo
Stop being so simple
Now fuck me like we in a limo
I ain't got time to kill, I got voids to fill
I got ocean views, I got water bills
I got cards to deal, I got hearts to steal
I got larger wheels on my automobile
I lost appeal
The bullshit cost me a mill
It brought me to tears
I came home and bought me a crib
I walk through that bitch
Strapped when it's dark in that bitch
And through hell and high water, I just walk on a bridge
I got a full cup of lean that I saw in the fridge
I started to swig
But end up drinking all of that shit
'Cause I deserve it, I be working hard for all of this shit
I step into a Rolls Royce when I walk out the pen

[Chorus]
My nigga, I'm, I'm post-bail ballin, post-bail ballin'
Go tell the warden I'm
I'm post-bail ballin', post-bail ballin'
Go tell the warden I'm
I'm post-bail ballin'
Farewell warden, I'm post-bail ballin'
Go tell the warden I'm
Post-bail ballin'
Inmate Carter
Post-bail ballin'

[Post-Chorus]
Soon as I get home, I'm go and get that brand new Bentley
And I'ma honk the horn ridin' past the penitentiary
And I'ma drive slow ridin' past the elementary
Then give it to my whoas, tell 'em "Don't even mention"
Soon as I get home, I'm go and get that brand new Bentley

[Intro: Junior Reid]
Starting, why?
Why?
Why?
Yeah

[Chorus: Junior Reid]
First degree murder
Beg them nuh push it further
This a nuh beef, we make burger
The youths, dem strapped with dem burner

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, real niggas say soowoo
And such and such killed such and such
The streets talk and bullshit walks on crutches, but
It's strut to strut
Niggas panic
Button pressing
The end is coming
Count your blessings
We living in the day and time
Where the ten commandments
Are now suggestions
How depressing
How infested
Click-clack, pow, intestines
Bad bitches in flower dresses with tight pussies
I found the crevice
AK bullets move mountains
Break them bitches down to pebbles
That tough talk is like music to my ears
So keep it a capella
Based on a true story
We not worried, y'all too worried
I faced my fears and told them motherfuckers y'all too gorgeous
Dread head from New Orleans
Where the youth, them got two choices
Shoot, or get shot, or a nigga choose for you
We murdered them

[Chorus: Junior Reid]
First degree murder
Beg dem nuh push it further
This a nuh beef, we make burger
The youths, dem strapped with dem burner
First degree murder
Beg dem nuh push it further
This a nuh beef, we make burger
'Cause the youths, dem strapped with dem burner

[Verse 2: Cory Gunz]
Yo, Tune point and I'm dusting niggas
I ain't talking lacing no marijuana
Soon as I hatched, I reigned like a quail
And gave two fucks, I ain't a koala
My uncle gangsta, but I make him nervous
All he see in my face is murder
Waste a burner is my waste a furnace
I pace and turn and she'll face the thermos
First birthday wish was getting caked up
Shoot a nigga, wake up on the wake-up
Lay down in a model bitch A-cup
Then I put pearls in a bitch like Jacob
Play tough, tape off of this tape-up
Race off like some motherfuckin' makeup
Take off, looking for something to take up
Get the paper or you goin' in the paper?
Not horoscopes, but in the horror scope
Pray to God you see tomorrow, nope
They gave my nigga thirty for a jar of dope
But do a nigga dirty with a bar of soap
Blowing so much, you sneezing dick
Believe in me, I don't believe in shit
Y'all pinching pennies? I'm squeezing drip
It's Young Money 'til I'm in the freezer stiff, bitch

[Chorus: Junior Reid]
First degree murder
Beg them nuh push it further
This a nuh beef, we make burger
The youths, dem strapped with dem burner
First degree murder
Beg dem nuh push it further
This a nuh beef, we make burger
'Cause the youths, dem strapped with dem burner

[Verse 3: N.O. Capo]
It's all about the money, nigga, fuck the fame
Where we come from, shots ring, nigga, broad day
Lil' woadie said he had a chance, he'd do this shit again
Poppin' pills for the pain, but still won't feel a thing
It's deeper than this rap, I'm in the back soaking game
Cartier frames got 'em looking at me strange
Why pre mostly heard and I'm rarely sane
Low-key can still get a brick off my name
Now I'ma tell you this here for my youngin 'nem
The same ones I hung the corners with, do numbers with
If it ever was a problem, watch 'em pull up quick
Caught an L sticking to the script, you know I switched
We now switch

[Chorus: Junior Reid]
First degree murder
Beg dem nuh push it further
This a nuh beef, we make burger
The youths, dem strapped with dem burner
First degree murder
Beg dem nuh push it further
This a nuh beef, we make burger
'Cause the youths, dem strapped with dem burner

[Outro: Junior Reid]
Starting, why?
Why?
Why?
Yeah

[Chorus: Bibi Bourelly & (Lil Wayne)]
I done spent so many of my days without you (Yeah)
I done lost all my love and found my way without you
I done gave up my soul, and gave up my pride
And taped up my heart, and wiped off my eyes
Without you, without you, yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]

Hands around this bottleneck, mmh
You got a new one

And if he trying to flex
You can give him my address, yeah
I be trying to rest
But Lord, the Devil busy
And when I do, I dream of you
And then the Devil pinch me
Do you ever miss me?
Do you ever wish we
Get it right and the rest is history?
I wish I could go back in time
And fix my lack of time
'Cause back then I had to grind
But see, you thought I’d rather grind
You thought I had the time
Thought I was lying half the time
And now I fantasize and agonize
To pass the time
Lord

[Chorus: Bibi Bourelly & (Lil Wayne)]
I done spent so many of my days without you (Uh)

But I'm getting through it

'Cause I know time will tell
But it be moving like a snail, yeah
You got a new one
I wish you well
Then I bite my nails
I'm scared I might hear wedding bells, uh
I guess I blew it
It never fails
You was tired of waiting to exhale
I wish I could go back in time
And fix my frame of mind
Back when everything was fine
And we would never think of dying
And I was yours and you was mine
And we combine and intertwine
And now we in decline
Finish line
End of time, Lord
Woo

[Chorus: Bibi Bourelly & (Lil Wayne)]
I done spent so many
(I done spent so many, way too many)
Of my days without you
(Of my days without you)
I done lost all my love

And found my way without you (Lord)
I done gave up my soul (Yeah)
And gave up my pride (Yeah)
Taped up my heart (Yeah)
And wiped off my eyes
Without you (Without you)
Without you (Without you)
Yeah

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Now you've been gone too long
True or false, right or wrong?
I'm left to live life alone
I'ma need more Styrofoams
If you find your way home
You know that porch light is on
I lay in bed wishing your side was warm
We wish we could go back in time
And push it in reverse
Cause this shit ain't for us
Baby, this shit for the birds
But I know what I'll do
I'll move on, I got to
And this is to you, for you
About you, without you, girl

[Chorus: Bibi Bourelly & (Lil Wayne)]
(I done spent so many, way too many
Of my days without you
I done lost all my love, Lord)
I done gave up my soul and gave up my pride
And taped up my heart and wiped off my eyes
Without you, without you

How you doing? I can tell, yeah
How you doing? I can tell
You look like yourself

Now baby, pass me my Hammer, go bail my bro out the slammer
Soon as I pour up this Fanta, I'm kickin' ass in Atlanta
I'm in L.A. with some women, I'm in Miami with hoes
Go overseas with my woes, merci beaucoup I suppose
My ho on the globe, I'm pourin' the 4
They got coke on the table, they got dope on the floor
You're really reading me wrong, phone roamin' in Rome
It's like I set it in stone, we blowin' blunts of the strong

[Intro]
Uhh, Uhh, I was chilling on the set
With the fully-automatic Tec
Thinking 'bout you girl
I was working my juug girl
But I was still thinking 'bout you

[Verse 1]
Uhh, bow-wow-wow, yippie-yo, yippie-yay
Can't trust these dog-ass hoes today
I say bow-wow-wow, yippie-yo, yippie-yay
Can't trust these dog-ass hoes today
But I got one I really fuck with
She makes my heart skip a beat
She dropped her drum stick
Sometimes we fuck forever, sometimes I cum quick
I eat that pussy 'cause it's sweet, as sweet as one-six
Sixteen bullets in a clip, but more than one clip
Shoot a nigga sixteen times until I'm convinced
I got strawberry cocaine as sweet as Fun Dip
You know I keep some nose candy for my young bitch
I love my young bitch
'Cause she don't give me drama
You don't want no drama
My goons waitin' for you, to snap
Like some photo bombers
Yeah we leave a nigga flat
We leave 'em horizontal
And then my lawyer tell your honor
On that morning, I was –

[Chorus]
Chilling on the set
With the fully automatic Tec
Thinking 'bout you girl
I was working my juug girl
But I was still thinking 'bout you girl
Yeah, I was chilling on the set
With the fully automatic Tec
Thinking 'bout you girl
I was working my juug girl
But I was still thinking 'bout you

[Bridge]
It go U-N-L-V
It go, it go U-N-L-V
It go U-N-L-V, U-N-L-V
Uptown Nigga Living Violent
Do I smell beef?

[Verse 2]
I was chilling on the corner about to get fucked up
My nigga T got a 40, and he brought two cups
That nigga Mack was chillin', Po was home talkin' on the phone
Lord, it's been such a good-year we need some Armor All
That nigga Hoody on the set, he got his hoodie on
Euro the future, fuck your future, like I'm reading palms
Wayne Chong, chinky eyes like I'm from Vietnam
Got my bitch with chinky eyes like that bitch Nia Long
Lord, I know I do my thing, can’t let my thing do me
Lord, I know I ain’t a Saint, still rep that fleur-de-lis
Lord, just keep Lil Reginae away from birds and bees
Let her be strong as the woman that gave birth to me
Fuck your degree, this murder in the first degree
I got that Tec under my arm like Right Guard, Sure, Degree
Lord, sometimes I just be so gone I be like "Earth to me?"
I burn some weed, I burp some lean, I served a fiend
While I was

[Chorus]
Chilling on the set
With a fully automatic Tec
I was thinking 'bout you girl
I was working my juug girl
But I was still thinking 'bout you girl
Yeah I was chilling on the set
With a fully automatic Tec
Thinking 'bout you girl
I was working my juug girl
But I was still thinking 'bout you, girl

[Outro]
Yeah
Thinking 'bout you girl
Working my juug girl
Still thinking 'bout you girl
Chilling on the set
With the fully automatic Tec
Thinking 'bout you girl
Working my juug girl
I was still thinking 'bout you

[Intro]
Ricky Racks, I see you!
Thugger!
YSL for life, bitch
Yeah fuck you, your momma and everything else
Yung Shad, you killed this track
Free the GOAT!

[Chorus]
That's my best friend, that's my best friend, flexin'
Big ol' booty bitch missus from Texas, what's next is
I'm gon' skeet off, lil' nigga come catch me, catch me
And that's my bestie, my bestie, my best friend, go best friend
Nigga livin' TTG and everything is still on fleek
Bad bitch rollin' wit' me, she gon' smile 'cause she on fleek
Hundred thousand dollars inside my pants, my shit on fleek
Hey-yeah! Yeah

[Verse 1]
Take them boys to school, swagonometry
Bitch I'm bleedin' bad, like a bumble bee
Hold up! Hold it, hold it, nigga proceed
I'ma eat that booty just like groceries
Eat on that coochie, lay that bitch down like "let's do it"
No Tiger, bitch, eat that wood, eat that wood
Supplier, bitch, I got pistols, no wood
I want them tacos that are Meagan Good
Helicopter choppin' with the buzz
Stuff them racks inside them if they nudge
Bang that other side, nigga curb
And my reefer louder than a speaker
Yeah my niece is hangin' with The Beatles
If you ever find her, better keep her
37 cameras for the sneakers
Goin' out like Ox or Beanie Sigel
Send a cop, I can't wait to mistreat 'em
Forcin' your ho, I can't wait to mislead 'em
And beat 'em, they ain't my people

[Chorus]
That's my best friend, that's my best friend, flexin'
Big ol' booty bitch missus from Texas, what's next is
I'm gon' skeet off, lil' nigga come catch me, catch me
And that's my bestie, my bestie, my best friend, go best friend
Nigga livin' TTG and everything is still on fleek
Bad bitch rollin' wit' me, she gon' smile 'cause she on fleek
Hundred thousand dollars inside my pants, my shit on fleek
Hey-yeah! Yeah!

[Verse 2]
Let me tell you how I spent a couple hundreds today
I done cut back on that lean, I'm on that Hen' and D'ussé
Don't do no talkin', when you see him, you better shoot in his face
I got a hundred bitches that can't wait to replace
Michael Jackson, nigga, Thugger Jackson moon walkin'
The S.L.I.M.E. army tool shoppin'
Me a horny goat, I'm boolin' at the bull stop
No I can't get arrested 'cause I'm talkin' 'bout my necklace
I'ma put that bitch in the buck, I'm a dog, let's get stuck
My lil' sister Dora, eat them Lucky Charms and give me luck
Waddup cuz? Here yo cup, call my Bloods, bring my bup
Your crew suck, don't got bucks, these ain't drugs, nigga

[Chorus]
That's my best friend, that's my best friend, flexin'
Big ol' booty bitch missus from Texas, what's next is
I'm gon' skeet off, lil' nigga come catch me, catch me
And that's my bestie, my bestie, my best friend, go best friend
Nigga livin' TTG and everything is still on fleek
Bad bitch rollin' wit' me, she gon' smile 'cause she on fleek
Hundred thousand dollars inside my pants, my shit on fleek
Hey-yeah!
Frustration and depression breaks me down
Descending like they wanted on the ground
The further our journey the less you care
That's why you laugh at Kanye when he's talking in the chair
But the same conversation but replaced
Is good enough for laughs or a smile on your face
Happy to be singing all our songs to survive
But when we need help, you don't get off 'til five
It's powerful to feel so alone in a group

Let me break this down for you
Tell you how we feel again
Your fear is all you hold
So when you see me it's not fair
I have nothing left to give
When you don't notice what is wrong
Charleston left me broken down
But it's just another day to you

I have nothing left to give you
And I'm too tired
To even talk about it
While watching the fire
Tasting pain coming from a place of truth
To be an other in a messy world
To feel like giving in another turn
You wouldn't listen if I told you
So how can I become anyone?

[TALWST]
When I was in Paris I was sitting in a cab
And before we could pull out, four plain clothes officers
Pulled up beside us and got out of the car
And put a badge to the backseat where I was sitting
And asked me to get out
And then the Marais where I was renting an apartment
In front of the cafe that I'd been going to
They proceeded to humiliate me, and saying that I was suspicious
And uh, ha, yeah it got pretty shitty
So I understand what you're going through
Being surrounded by friends of privilege
Who don't get it, when we're in a world where
A lot of faces don't look like us
So I understand what you're going through man

[Dev Hynes]
So I was looking up what my lost name means
What its origin is
My last name is Hynes, H-Y-N-E-S
Gets spelled a number of different ways
H-I-N-E-S, the most common spelling
And um, I found that it originates from the name O'Heyens
O-H-E-Y-E-N-S
And that origin is Irish, it's an Irish name
I always knew my name would essentially be based of a slave name
But yes, it's an Irish name, meaning servant
So, essentially, not only is my last name a name originated from slave trade
But it literally means a servant
So, I mean, it's a weird thing to have to carry around
I'm proud of my name, I'm proud of my dad, I'm proud of my family
But it's very strange to have to carry that every day
We all carry that. All, every black person carries that
It's strange, I've been thinking about this a lot
Essentially, almost what this album is, is myself
I feel like I'm deconstructing myself, trying to work out who I am
So I'm not this painted image of who I was
I think in my past I was almost rejecting
An image of myself that wasn't even mine
What I mean by that is, there's this um
There's this James Baldwin interview where he is discussing, when he was writing Native Son
How he was growing up rejecting this image that was painted of him
He never had eaten watermelon before, he never really listened to jazz before
You know all these things that the white man has painted of the black person, the person's culture
Now that's not to say those things don't have richness in them
That you can celebrate, that we did create
So we're here to essentially go back, deconstruct all of that
And learn to speak for the first time
I feel like I'm learning to speak again, in my late twenties
I mean that's, it's a strange thing, I mean
Putting something out into the world, anything out into the world -
That doesn't just mean art - yourself, out there -
It's strange to add to all of this knowing that
Your voice essentially may not matter in the grand scheme of things
That's actually, that's kind of wrong y'know, we have to keep putting our voice out there
Because someone somewhere is going to hear it: we do exist
So we have to keep deconstructing our past, reevaluating, and learn to speak
It's all we can do. And, I'm proud of it. I'm going to reclaim it
And, hopefully, we'll move on longer, through other people. The same name. The same thing goes for every other slave name. We have to reclaim, refocus

I might kill it but I never will abuse you
Baby fuck with me or else I might excuse you
Tryna' get up in a thug

Lil' nigga, my water blue like a genie (Woah)
Too much money to go to jail, they can't have a freebie (No way)
I bring them racks off the shelf, bitch, you know they're bleeding
Too crazy, too crazy (What?)

Three crazy, three crazy (Three crazy)
I just might come for you like the Navy
One crazy, two crazy

Hey, I'm just like this
Too hot, I need a fan, no 'Tasia (Woah)

[Chorus: Young Thug]
She callin' me Jeffery
I protect her like a seatbelt (And what?)
Nigga, money stacked up like three shelves
Run my older hoes off, keep my feet there
I might settle in the shore, no seashells
I hope I'ma ride that bitch like a V12 (Ayy)
Ayy, baby girl, don't meet me there, beat me there
Plus I am a freak like three Kelsis (Woah)
Pull on up, baby, pull on up, hey (Skrrt)
Got some racks, baby, Toys 'R' Us, woah (Woah, woah, woah)
I'm livin' that life, woah
Baby, I'm important like in Pedialyte (Woah, woah)

[Verse 4: Young Thug]
I just drink that lean on me, I promise I ain't goin' broke
When I hit the club, them strippers smile, I give 'em hope
I know how it feels to be so broke that you got jokes
... Hah
I know, I know, I know, I know how to get that paper
I know, I know how it feels to stack racks up like acres
I know, I know how it feels, 2,000-channel cable
Eliantte-antte got me lookin' like the mayor
(What you be, Thug?) I'm a player
(And what, Thug?) I'm a slayer
(And what, Thug?) I make bail
(And plus?) I won't tell

(In a what?) In a Beamer
(And what?) And I'm drinkin' four ounces in liter (Lean)

[Chorus: Young Thug]
She callin' me Jeffery (And what?)
I protect her like a seat belt (What?)
Nigga, money stacked up like three shelves (What, what?)
Run my older hoes off, keep my feet there (Woo)

[Intro]
Goose Wit Another One
Goose got another one!

[Verse]
First of all
Two step with a rich nigga
You don't wanna wake up with a bitch nigga
I'm the solution like Vicks nigga
If she thirsty pour four up in quintz with her
Bitch I got more wood than a tree
And I'm silent no street

Slightly water slow leaks
No STD but I run my ward
Where were you when I was horny

Ain't been asleep but I'm slopping on that pussy
And my mans too ya

Now I don't, I don't, I don't

Pistol to his head, piss running down his leg
He shitted on his self and found his ass left for dead
I'm looking out for feds, 'cause snitches be hating
I rob your partner wild and then you come and get some straight
44 snub nose hit you real close
Smoke the bubble kush, blood, who gives a fuck, folk?
Rob Gucci Mane? Ha, that's a good joke

Everybody, everybody gotta go, nigga

[Verse 1]
In the end, it's stronger than I know how to be
And I can't just spend my whole lifetime wondering
I fell in love with the sound of my heels on the wooden floor
I don't want our footsteps to be silent anymore

[Refrain]
Want them to be in the moment
Storm clouds are closing

[Verse 2]
In the end it’s coming, there’s nothing left to do
But I'm still not certain, just how I'm gonna feel

[Refrain]
I'll only know in the moment
Anticipation growing

[Chorus]
It's getting closer
It's getting closer
It's getting closer
(I'm not ready)
It's getting closer
(I need a little more time)

[Outro]
It's getting closer
(Closer every day)
(Don't cry, we'll be okay)
It's getting closer
(Closer, call of the damned)
(Hold on and breathe if you can)
It's getting closer
(Closer, I'm not ready)
Ooh, it's getting closer
(I need a little more time)
(Breathe if you can)
It's getting closer
(I'm not ready yet)
It's getting closer
(I need a little more time)
It's getting closer
It's getting closer

[Interlude]
But is there something more than that?
But is there something more than that?
But is there something more than that?
But is there something more than that?
But is there something more than that?
But is there something more than that?
But is there something more than that?
But is there something more than that?
But is there something more than that?
But is there something more than that?
But is there something more than that?
But is there something more than that?
But is there something more than that?
But is there something more than that?

[Verse 1]
I can just hear them now
"How could you let us down?"
But they don't know what I found
Or see it from this way 'round
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
One by one, every trait
I tried, but it's way too late
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
Will I be in too deep?
Going with what I always longed for

[Chorus]
Feel like a brand new person
(But you'll make the same old mistakes)
I don't care, I'm in love
(Stop before it's too late)
(I know) Feel like a brand new person
(But you'll make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what it's like (You don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it's too late)
(I know there's too much at stake)
(Making the same mistakes)
And I still don't know why it's happening
(Stop while it's not too late)
And I still don't know

[Verse 2]
Finally taking flight
I know you don't think it's right
I know that you think it's fake
Maybe fake's what I like
The point is, I have the right
Not thinking in black and white
I'm thinking it's worth the fight
Soon to be out of sight
Knowing it all this time
Going with what I always longed for

[Chorus]
Feel like a brand new person
(But you'll make the same old mistakes)
I don't care, I'm in love
(Stop before it's too late)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you'll make the same old mistakes)
So how do I know I've gone too far? (You don't have what it takes)
(Stop before it's too late)

[Bridge]
Man, I know that it's hard to digest
But maybe your story ain't so different from the rest
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
And I know that it's hard to digest
A realisation is as good as a guess
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets

[Outro]
Feel like a brand new person
So, how will I know that it's right?
In a new direction
So, how will I know I've gone too far?
(Stop thinking that the only option was)
Feel like a brand new person
I finally know what it's like
(Stop thinking that the only option was)
In a new direction
So how will I know I've gone too far?
(Stop thinking that the only option was)
And I know it's hard to describe
(Stop thinking that the only option was)
So how will I know that it's right?

[Verse 1]
I may not be as honest as I ought to be
Now that, when the walls go up
I said it didn't worry me but it hit me like an arrow
Babe, to know, I could just be paranoid
Won't quell the desire to know what was really going on
"Does it really fucking matter, babe?" is all you can ask me
Okay, fair play, here we go

[Verse 2]
I've heard those words before
Are you sure it was nothing
Cause it made me feel like dying inside
Never thought I was insecure, but it's pure
Didn't notice until I was in love for real
Am I really gonna cross the line
Just to find what you're typing?
If only I could read your mind
Ooh, I'd be fine, I'd be normal
Now’s my time, gonna do it

[Verse 3]
And suddenly I'm the phony one
The only one with a problem
True love is bringing it out of me
The worst in me, and I know now
Do you remember the time we were
The time we were by the ocean?
I didn't care if it was day or night
The world was right where I wanted
Girl, I'm sorry
Babe, I'm really, really sorry

[Verse 1]
I was raging, it was late
In the world my demons cultivate
I felt the strangest emotion but it wasn't hate for once
Yes, I'm changing, yes, I'm gone
Yes, I'm older, yes, I'm moving on
And if you don't think it's a crime, you can come along with me
Life is moving, can't you see
There's no future left for you and me
I was hoping and I was searching endlessly
But baby, now there's nothing left that I can do

[Chorus]
So don't be blue
There is another future
Waiting there for you

[Verse 2]
I saw it different, I must admit
I caught a glimpse, I'm going after it
They say people never change but that's bullshit, they do
Yes, I'm changing, can't stop it now
And even if I wanted I wouldn't know how
Another version of myself I think I've found at last
And I can't always hide away
Curse indulgence and despise the fame
There is a world out there and it's calling my name
And it's calling yours, girl

[Refrain]
It's calling yours, too
It's calling yours, too
It's calling yours, too
It's calling yours, too

[Outro]
It's calling out for you
Arise and walk on through
(Time rolls on)
A world beyond that door is calling out for you
(Time rolls on)
Arise and walk on through
It's calling out for you
(Listen to it call)
Arise and walk, come through
A world beyond that door
(Listen to it call)
Is calling out for you

Step out into the dawn
You pray ’til, you pray ’til the lights come on
And don’t you feel like you’ve just been born?

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, you come to raise me up
When I’m beaten and broken up

We’ll go, set the world alight
We’re gonna lose ourselves tonight
We’re go be birds, we’ll fly
We’ll go, set the world alight
We’re gonna lose ourselves tonight

[Outro]
Heaven
Fairy tales can come true, it can happen to you
If you're young at heart
For it's hard, you will find, to be narrow of mind
If you're young at heart

You can go to extremes with impossible schemes
You can laugh when your dreams fall apart at the seams
And life gets more exciting with each passing day
And love is either in your heart, or on it's way

Don't you know that it's worth every treasure on earth
To be young at heart
For as rich as you are, it's much better by far
To be young at heart

And if you should survive to 105
Look at all you'll derive out of being alive
And here is the best part, you have a head start
If you are among the very young at heart

And if you should survive to 105
Look at all you'll derive out of being alive
And here is the best part, you have a head start
If you are among the very young at heart
Three coins in the fountain
Each one seeking happiness
Thrown by three hopeful lovers
Which one will the fountain bless

Three hearts in the fountain
Each heart longing for its home
There they lie in the fountain
Somewhere in the heart of Rome

Which one will the fountain bless
Which one will the fountain bless

Three coins in the fountain
Through the ripples how they shine
Just one wish will be granted
One heart will wear a valentine

Make it mine
Make it mine
Make it mine
Three coins in the fountain
Through the ripples how they shine
And just one wish will be granted
One heart will wear a valentine

Make it mine
Make it mine
Make it mine
Pennies in a stream
Falling leaves a sycamore
Moonlight in Vermont

Icy finger waves
Ski trails on a mountain side
Snowlight in Vermont

Telegraph cables, they sing down the highway
And travel each bend in the road
People who meet in this romantic setting
Are so hypnotized by the lovely

Evening summer breeze
Warbling of the meadowlark
Moonlight in Vermont

Telegraph cables, they sing down the highway
And travel each bend in the road
People who meet in this romantic setting
Are so hypnotized by the lovely
Evening summer breeze
The warbling of a meadowlark
Moonlight in Vermont
Moonlight in Vermont
Moonlight in Vermont

[Verse 1]
I'm edging closer, shivers all over
It's way too real, I'm way too sober
Usually they've got you covered all over
Lack of composure, I'm walking over
What will I do?
I never had a chance to

[Chorus]
There's no one else around you
Not that I was waiting, vision ever fading
Heading for the deep end
Soon as I remember, baby, I surrender
I just need to breathe out
Decisions are approaching, reality in motion

[Verse 2]
Trying to be patient but I'm feeling ancient
Trying to control the way that I'm facing
Suppose that I didn't care anymore
Fate can decide, I can ignore
I'll just pretend that I always knew
That I had the chance to

[Chorus]
There's no one else around you
Not that I was waiting, vision ever fading
Making such a promise
Only leads to heartache, closer to an earthquake
Talked about in Hollywood
Trying to stay in motion

[Bridge]
It made my heart run in circles and overflow
And I was closer than ever to letting go
It made my heart run in circles and overdrive
And I was closer than ever to feeling alive
It made my heart run in circles and overflow
And I was closer than ever to letting go
It made my heart run in circles and overdrive
And I was closer than ever to feeling alive

[Chorus]
There's no one else around you
Not that I was waiting, vision ever fading
Heading for the deep end
Soon as I remember, baby, I surrender
I just need to breathe out
Decisions are approaching, reality in motion

[Outro]
Let's not think about it
Put your arms around me, I can sense you doubt me
You don't need to promise
That only leads to heartache, closer to an earthquake
Talked about in Hollywood
All there's left to do, all there's left to do
All there's left to do, all there's left to do
All there's left to do, all there's left to do
All there's left to do, all there's left to do
All there's left to do, all there's left...

[Verse 1: Rocko]
Now listen brah, for years I was runnin from the law
Believe the shit that I saw
Woke up everyday, wanted more
Shit that I done did, if I could I do it all again
That shit made me who I'm am
That shit got me all these mils
All these days I was starvin', back touchin' my stomach
Daydreamin', wonderin', how I'mma get me some money
Slipped ten toes in that trap, finessed niggas out sacks
I did shit that I ain't proud of, still I wouldn't take it back
Nowadays I take my thoughts, then I'm down like a wrestler
Work hard like a slave but live better than the master
And what we do it wrong, why it feel so right?
Thank God everyday, I don't know how I'm still alive
My life, my life, I earned my stripes
My life, my life, I grew up trife
Been gettin' money since a young nigga
Streets labeled me the Dun dealer

[Chorus: Young Thug]
My life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life

[Verse 2: Playa]
King slime, triple cross king
Trunk full of Yao Ming
Crocodile long (?), alligator on my feet
I stretch the work out, like an athlete
My shooter air it out, watch a track meet
I turn ya'll niggas to meat
I used to rap the things in the inner-tube
Now I kick this rich nigga shit on pro tools
My life I done sold them bricks
My life I done hit them licks
My life is so high risk
And I'm prayin' for Bloody Jay
Because that nigga wild with that AK
And ask Thug, and ask Slug
My shooter got a shooter nigga
Rock put me on this rap shit
So he took me out that trap shit

[Chorus: Young Thug]
My life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life

[Verse 3: Young Thug]
Me and my ho were arguin'
Money was lookin' funny
She was like you trippin' baby
You know I wouldn't do nothin' brazy
So I sat down and thought about how long ago I caught them caps
Now my homie done think I'm trippin' cause my money surrounded by traps, oh
I got mice bitin' through my shit
And ya my diamonds are so white
It looks like lights off in my shit
And I be high as a son of a bitch
So ya my flight just might be risk
And she vibin' to this shit
She know I'll eat her alive
And my weed strong
You can fart by me
And when you smell it
Let Young Thugger tell it
Couple bands on my feet
Walk through the door and duck like Yao Ming
I'm a motherfuckin' army man cause all I want is green
My life I been in them traps
My life I (?) that scrap
My life I done took niggas life
My life you wouldn't get by
I'm with my big homie Jay and my big homie Rock
Instead of them big homie stocks
And we pull big homie guap

[Chorus: Young Thug]
My life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life

[Verse 1]
I thought we were great
You took your love back and ran us off track
I counted all the days
'Til you would come back, how stupid was that?

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you're missing what we used to have
Guess the vodka brought the feeling back
I was caught up in the aftermath
But now, if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero
Gave a hundred percent but all I got from you, zero, zero
I thought you were the one, then you turned and run
Found somebody better, like I never met ya
Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero
(Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero)
That’s how many fucks I give, oh

[Verse 2]
Wake up with a dime
Get up to no good, get up and you could
Go out, free our minds
Like you never would, never understood

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Now you're missing what we used to have
You been creeping 'round my Instagram
I was caught up in the aftermath
But now, if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero
Gave a hundred percent but all I got from you, zero, zero
I thought you were the one, then you turned to run
Found somebody better, like I never met ya
Ask how many nights I’ve been thinking of you, zero, zero
(Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero)
That’s how many fucks I give

[Bridge]
Broke back then but a nigga rich now
Got dollars, got euros, got yen, I got pounds, zeros, zeros
Calling me up ‘cause your bad check bounced
My new chick one hundred, and she got her own dinero, zero
You think I'm thinking 'bout your ass?

[Chorus]
Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero
Gave a hundred percent but all I got from you, zero, zero
I thought you were the one, then you turned to run
Found somebody better, like I never met ya
Ask how many nights I’ve been thinking of you, zero, zero
(Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero)
That’s how many fucks I give
(Zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero)
That’s how many fucks I give
No more beautiful moons may we spend on our land
In the north, the scarlet council talks of war
And the long knives have massacred the tribe
And burned our corn
We're not welcome in our homeland anymore

No more songs of the hunters on the baffalo plain
No more smoke from sacred fires touch these hills
And the numbers of the people grow fewer every mile
And our children will not leave the Great Spirit's ways

There will be a trail of tears
There will be a trail of pain
And Jackson will have the Mississippi
And the twenty dollar bill
But for us the trail is all that will remain

On the streets of Rapid City
On the road to Wounded Knee
There is whiskey for forgetting everything
But the old ones say
"There may be time learning from each other
The way that it had once been meant to be"
There is still a trail of tears
There is still a trail of pain
And Jackson has got the Mississippi
And the twenty dollar bill
But for us the trail of tears remains

And Jackson has got the Mississippi
And the twenty dollar bill
But how long will the trail of tears remain?

[Intro]

Love laughs at a king, kings don't mean a thing on the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two can be made like new on the street of dreams

Gold, silver and gold
All you can hold's up there on a moonbeam
Poor, there ain't nobody poor
Long as love is sure on the street of dreams

All the gold, silver and gold
All you can hold's up there on a moonbeam
Poor, nobody's poor
Long as love is sure on the street of dreams
If you are but a dream
I hope I never waken
It's more than I could bear
To find that I'm forsaken

If you're a fantasy
Then I'm content to be
In love with lovely you
And pray my dream comes true

I long to kiss you
But I would not dare
I'm so afraid that
You may vanish in the air

So darling
If our romance would break up
I hope I never wake up
If you are but a dream
If I don't see her each day, I miss her
Gee what a thrill, each time I kiss her
Believe me, I've got a case
On nancy, with the laughing face

She takes the winter and makes it summer
And summer could take some lessons from her
Picture a tomboy in lace
That's nancy with the laughing face

Have you ever heard mission bells ringing
Well she'll give you the very same glow
When she speaks you would think it was singing
Just hear her say hello

I swear to goodness, you can't resist her
Sorry for you, she has no sister
No angel could replace
Nancy, with the laughing face
What good are words I say to you?
They can't convey to you whats in my heart
If you could hear instead
The things Ive left unsaid

Time after time
I tell myself that I'm
So lucky to be loving you

So lucky to be
The one you run to see
In the evening, when the day is through

I only know what I know
The passing years will show
Youve kept my love so young, so new

And time after time
Youll hear me say that I'm
So lucky to be loving you
Dear, this evening seemed to go so awfully fast
We had so much fun and now you're home at last
I look forward to a kiss or two at the garden gate
But she gave me just a peck and insisted it was late

Give me five minutes more, only five minutes more
Let me stay, let me stay in your arms
Here am I, begging for only five minutes more
Only five minutes more of your charms

All week long I dreamed about our Saturday date
Don't you know that Sunday morning you can sleep late?
Give me five minutes more, only five minutes more
Let me stay, let me stay in your arms

All week long I dreamed about our Saturday date
Don't you know that Sunday morning you can sleep late?
Give me five minutes more, only five minutes more
Let me stay, let me stay in your arms

Ah, come on
Night and day, you are the one
Only you 'neath the moon or under the sun
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter, darling, where you are
I think of you day and night

Night and day, why is it so
That this longin' for you follows wherever I go?
In the roarin' traffic's boom
In the silence of my lonely room
I think of you day and night

Night and day, under the hide of me
There's an oh, such a hungry yearnin' burnin' inside of me
And its torment won't be through
Till you let me spend my life makin' love to you
Day and night, night and day

Night and day, you are the one
Only you 'neath the moon or under the sun
Whether near to me or far
It's no matter, baby, where you are
I think of you day and night
Night and day, why is it so
That this longin' for you follows wherever I go?
In the roarin' traffic's boom
Silence of my lonely room
I think of you day and night

Night and day, under the hide of me
There's an oh, such a hungry burning inside of me
And its torment won't be through
Till you let me spend life makin' love to you
Day and night, night and day
I'm sentimental, so I walk in the rain
I've got some habits even I can't explain
Could start for the corner, turn up in Spain
But why try to change me now?

I sit and daydream, I've got daydreams galore
Cigarette ashes, there they go on the floor
I'll go away weekends, leave my keys in the door
But why try to change me now?

Why can't I be more conventional?
People talk, people stare, so I try
But that's not for me, 'cause I can't see
My kind of crazy world go passing me by

So, let people wonder, let 'em laugh, let 'em frown
You know I'll love you till the moon's upside down
Don't you remember I was always your clown?
Why try to change me now?
Don't worry 'bout me
I'll get along
Forget about me
Be happy, my love

Let's say that our little show is over
And so the story ends
Why not call it a day the sensible way
And still be friends

Look out for yourself
Should always be the rule
Give your heart and your love to whom ever you love
Don't you be a fool

Darlin', why stop to cling to some fading thing
That used to be
If you can't forget
Don't you worry 'bout me

Baby, why should you cling to some fading thing
That used to be
If you can't forget
Don't you worry 'bout me
My funny valentine
Sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet you're my favorite work of art

Is your figure less than Greek
Is your mouth a little weak
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?

But don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay, little valentine, stay
Each day is Valentine's Day

Is your figure less than Greek
Is your mouth a little weak
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?
But don't change a hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay, little valentine, stay
Each day is Valentine's Day
There are many, many crazy things
That will keep me loving you
And with your permission
May I list a few?

The way you wear your hat
The way you sip your tea
The memory of all that
No no, they can't take that away from me

The way your smile just beams
The way you sing off-key
The way you haunt my dreams
No no, they can't take that away from me

We may never, never meet again
On that bumpy road to love
Still I'll always
Always keep the memory of

The way you hold your knife, do do do do do do
The way we danced until three
The way you've changed my life
No no, they can't take that away from me
No, they can't take that away from me

[Intro]
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
No that's... Snooperman

[Verse 1]
I said some pimp juice
I lay low to get loose
Word on the streets is Doggy Dogg got the goose
On the moon
Cause he got a lot to prove
He never tasted the fever this one he gon' lose
On the deuce
I once wanted the truce
But fuck that, this nigga think he bulletproof
I can't talk him, so I brought chalk to him
I had the lame on the asphalt, bitch nigga ask how
DPGC, L-O-N-G-B-E-A-C-H
Is the only way that we play
I catch a nigga by the collar
Act like we need to holler
I let you slide when you fuck me up the million dollars
Bought me a bitch, a house and a Impala
And that they call me top dollar

[Hook]
I do like I do it, can't nobody do it like I can
I'm Snooperman
Look up in the sky, real high like a bird so I'm fly
I'm Snooperman
I do like I do it, can't nobody do it like I can
I'm Snooperman

[Verse 2]
It was December 18th seven days before Christmas
I was at the pad putting together my wish list
Back then I mean my game was so vicious
I had to shoot a nigga, just cause he was on bitch shit
I mean it seemed so senseless
But I'm a superhero so my life is relentless
Biting rhymes nah, I be biting grinds
And fucking niggas up accross of the line
Flying through the sky like a bird off that purple light
You niggas can't wait for me to turn it out
I flip a style, crip a while, gon' honey child
Ran up about a hundred miles
Threw about a hundred styles
You can check my file I'm the one and only
I make records for the girls and the lil homies

[Hook]
I do like I do it, can't nobody do it like I can
I'm Snooperman
Look up in the sky, real high like a bird so I'm fly
I'm Snooperman
I do like I do it, can't nobody do it like I can
I'm Snooperman

[Interlude]
Wow Snooperman is totally awesome
I used to wanna be Batman, The Incredible Hulk
Spiderman fuck them
I wanna be Snooperman
He is the greatest superhero of all time
I love you Snooperman, you're the greatest
Woah Snooperman my hero

[Hook]
I do like I do it, can't nobody do it like I can
I'm Snooperman
Look up in the sky, real high like a bird so I'm fly
I'm Snooperman
I do like I do it, can't nobody do it like I can
I'm Snooperman
It was just one of those things
Just one of those crazy flings
One of those bells that now and then rings
Just one of those things

It was just one of those nights
Just one of those fabulous flights
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings
Just one of those things

If we'd thought a bit 'bout the end of it
When we started painting the town
We'd have been aware that our love affair
Was too hot not to cool down

So goodbye, dear, and Amen
Here's hoping we'll meet now and then
It was great fun
But it was just one of those things

It was just, just one of those nights
Just one of those fabulous flights
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings
Just one of those things
If we'd thought of it 'bout the end of it
When we started painting that town
We'd have been aware that our love affair
Was too hot not to cool down

So goodbye, goodbye, bye, bye, goodbye, baby, and Amen
Here's hoping we'll meet now and then
It was great fun
But it was just one of those things
There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that she turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me
I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
To one who'll watch over me

Although I may not be the man some
Girls think of as handsome
To her heart I'll carry the key
Won't you tell her please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me

Won't you tell her please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh, how I need
Someone to watch over me
The tables are empty
The dance floor's deserted
You play the same love song
It's the 10th time you've heard it

That's the beginning
Just one of the clues
You've had your first lesson
In learnin' the blues

The cigarettes you light
One after another
Won't help you forget her
And the way that you love her

You're only burnin'
A torch you can't lose
But you're on the right track
For learnin' the blues

When you're at home alone
The blues will taunt you constantly
When you're out in a crowd
The blues will haunt your memory
The nights when you don't sleep
The whole night you're crying
But you can't forget her
Soon you even stop trying

You'll walk that floor
And wear out your shoes
When you feel your heart break
You're learnin' the blues

When you're at home alone
The blues will taunt you constantly
When you're out in a crowd
Those blues will haunt your memory

The nights when you don't sleep
That whole night you're crying
But you can't forget her
Soon you even stop trying

You'll walk the floor
And you'll wear out your shoes
When you feel your heart break
You're learnin' those blues

[Chorus]
Love and marriage, love and marriage
Go together like a horse and carriage
This I tell ya, brother
Ya can't have one without the other

Love and marriage, love and marriage
It's an institute you can't disparage
Ask the local gentry
And they will say it's elementary

[Pre-Chorus]
Try, try, try to separate them
It's an illusion
Try, try, try and you will only come
To this conclusion

[Chorus]
Love and marriage, love and marriage
Go together like a horse and carriage
Dad was told by mother
You can't have one, you can't have none
You can't have one without the other

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
Try, try, try to separate them
It's an illusion
Try, try, try and you will only come
To this conclusion

[Chorus]
Love and marriage, love and marriage
Go together like a horse and carriage
Dad was told by mother
You can't have one (You can't have none)
You can't have one without the other
Hey there cutes, put on your dancin' boots and come dance with me
Come dance with me, what an evening for some Terpsichore
Pretty face, I know a swingin' place, come on dance with me
Romance with me on a crowded floor

And while the rhythm swings
What lovely things I'll be sayin'
'Cause what is dancing
Making love set to music, playin'

When the band begins to leave the stand and folks start to roam
As we walks home, cheek to cheek we'll be
Come on, come on, come on, come on and dance with me

Hey there cutes, put on your basie boots and come dance with me
Come dance with me, what an evening for some Terpsichore
Pretty face, I know a swingin' place, come on dance with me
Romance with me on a crowded floor

And while the rhythm swings
What cuckoo things I'll be sayin'
For what is dancing
Making love set to music, playin'
When the band begins to leave the stand and folks start to roam
As we wing home, cheek to cheek we'll be
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on and dance with me
You make me feel so young
You make me feel so spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy individual

The moment that you speak
I wanna go play hide-and-seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I are just like a couple of tots
Running across the meadow
Picking up lots of forget-me-nots

You make me feel so young
You make me feel there are songs to be sung
Bells to be rung
And a wonderful fling to be flung

And even when I'm old and gray
I'm gonna feel the way I do today
'Cause you make me feel so young
You make me feel so young
You make me feel so spring has sprung
And every time I see you grin
I'm such a happy individual

The moment that you speak
I wanna go play hide-and-seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon

You and I are just like a couple of tots
Running across the meadow
Picking up lots of forget-me-nots

You make me feel so young
You make me feel there are songs to be sung
Bells to be rung
Wonderful fling to be flung

And even when I'm old and gray
I'm gonna feel the way I do today
'Cause you, you make me feel so young
You make me feel so young
You make me feel so young
Ooh, you make me feel so young
Waking skies at sunrise
Every sunset too
Seems to be bringing me
Memories of you

Here and there, everywhere
Scenes that we once knew
And they all just recall
Memories of you

How I wish, I could forget those
Those happy yesteryears
That have left a rosary of tears

Your face beams in my dreams
'Spite of all I do
Everything seems to bring
Memories of you

And your face beams in my dreams
'Spite of all I do
Everything seems to bring
Memories, just memories of you
You're just too marvelous, too marvelous for words
Like "glorious", "glamorous" and that old standby "amorous"
It's all too wonderful, I'll never find the words
That say enough, tell enough, I mean they just aren't swell enough

You're much too much, and just too "very, very"
To ever be in Webster's Dictionary
And so I'm borrowing a love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous - too marvelous for words

You're much - you're too much - and just too "very, very"
To ever be, to ever be in Webster's Dictionary
And so I'm borrowing a love song from the birds
To tell you that you're marvelous
Tell you that you're marvelous
Tell you that you're marvelous - too marvelous for words
Next time you're found, with your chin on the ground
There a lot to be learned, so look around

Just what makes that little old ant
Think he'll move that rubber tree plant
Anyone knows an ant, can't
Move a rubber tree plant

But he's got high hopes, he's got high hopes
He's got high apple pie, in the sky hopes

So any time you're gettin' low
'stead of lettin' go
Just remember that ant
Oops, there goes another rubber tree plant

When troubles call, and your back's to the wall
There a lot to be learned, that wall could fall

Once there was a silly old ram
Thought he'd punch a hole in a dam
No one could make that ram, scram
He kept buttin' that dam
'Cause he had high hopes, he had high hopes
He had high apple pie, in the sky hopes

So any time you're feelin' bad
'stead of feelin' sad
Just remember that ram
Oops there goes a billion kilowatt dam

All problems just a toy balloon
They'll be bursted soon
They're just bound to go pop
Oops, there goes another problem kerplop
How little we know
How much to discover
What chemical forces flow
From lover to lover

How little we understand
What touches off that tingle
That sudden explosion
When two tingles intermingle

Who cares to define
What chemistry this is
Who cares with your lips on mine
How ignorant bliss is

So long as you kiss me
And the world around us shatters
How little it matters how little we know

How little we understand
What touches off that tingle
That sudden explosion
When two tingles intermingle
Who cares to define
What chemistry this is
Who cares with your lips on mine
How ignorant bliss is

So long as you kiss me
And the world around us shatters
How little it matters how little we know
How little we know
How little we know
I couldn't sleep a wink last night
Because we had that silly fight
I thought my heart would break the whole night through
I knew that you'd be sorry
And I'm sorry too

I didn't have my favorite dream
The one in which I hold you tight
I had to call you up this morning
To see if everything was still all right
Yes, I had to call you up this morning
'Cause I couldn't sleep a wink last night

I didn't have my favorite dream
The one in which I hold you tight
I had to call you up this morning
To see if everything was still all right
Yes, I had to call you up this morning
Cause I couldn't sleep a wink last night
It's not the pale moon that excites me
That thrills and delights me, oh no
It's just the nearness of you

It isn't your sweet conversation
That brings this sensation, oh no
It's just the nearness of you

When youre in my arms and I feel you so close to me
All my wildest dreams come true

I need no soft lights to enchant me
If you'll only grant me the right
To hold you ever so tight
And to feel in the night the nearness of you
In the still of the night as I gaze out of my window
At the moon in its flight, my thoughts all stray to you
In the still of the night while the world lies in slumber
Oh the times without number when I say to you
Do you love me, as I love you
Are you my life to be that dream come true
Or will this dream of mine will it fade way out of sight
Just like that moon growing dim, on the rim of the hill
In the still, still of the night
The sleepless nights - the daily fights
The quick toboggan - when you reach the heights
I miss the kisses - and I miss the bites
I wish I were in love again

The broken dates - the endless waits
The lovely loving - and the hateful hates
The conversation - with the flying plates
I wish I were in love again

No more pain - no more strain
Now I'm sane - but I would rather be punch drunk

The pulled out fur - of cat and cur
The fine mismating - of a him and her
Ive learned my lesson - but I wish I were
In love again

The furtive sigh - the blackened eye
The words: I love you - til the day I die
The self deception - that believes the lie
I wish I were in love again
When love congeals - it soon reveals
The faint aroma - of performing seals
The double-crossing - of a pair of heals
I wish I were in love again

No, no more care - no, no despair
Now I'm all there (now) - but I'd rather be punch drunk

Believe me sir - I much prefer
The classic battle - of a him and her
I dont like quiet - and I wish I were
In love again - in love again - in love again
She gets too hungry for dinner at eight
She likes the theatre and never comes late
She never bothers with people she'd hate
That's why the lady is a tramp

Doesn't like crap games with barons or earls
Won't go to Harlem in ermine and pearls
Won't dish the dirt with the rest of the girls
That's why the lady is a tramp

She likes the free fresh wind in her hair
Life without care
She's broke and it's oke
Hates California, it's cold and it's damp
That's why the lady is a tramp

She gets too hungry to wait for dinner at eight
She loves the theatre but never comes late
She'd never bother with people she'd hate
That's why the lady is a tramp
She'll have no crap games with sharpies and frauds
And she won't go to Harlem in Lincolns or Fords
And she won't dish the dirt with the rest of the broads
That's why the lady is a tramp

She loves the free fresh wind in her hair
Life without care
She's broke but it's oke
Hates California, it's so cold and so damp
That's why the lady, that's why the lady
That's why the lady is a tramp
From this moment on
You for me, dear
Only two for tea, dear
From this moment on

From this happy day
No more blue songs
Only hoop-dee-doo songs
From this moment on

For you've got the love I need so much
You've got the skin that I love to touch
Got the arms to hold me tight
Got those sweet lips to kiss me goodnight

From this moment on
You and I, babe
We'll be ridin' high, babe
Every care is gone
From this moment on
From this moment on
You for me, dear
Only two for tea, dear
From this moment on

From, from this happy day
No more blue songs
Only hoop-dee-doo songs
From this moment on

For you've got the love that I need so much
Yeah, you've got the kind of skin that I love to touch
And you've got the arms that can hold me tight
You've got those lovely lips just to kiss me goodnight

From this moment on
You and I, babe
We'll be ridin' high, babe
Every one of our cares are gone
From this moment
From this very moment
From this moment on
Hey, drink up, all you people
Order anything you see
Have fun you happy people
The drink and the laugh's on me

Try to think that love's not around
Still, it's uncomfortably near
My old heart ain't gainin' any ground
Because my angel eyes ain't here

Angel eyes, that old devil's sent
They grow unbearably bright
Need I say that my love's misspent
Misspent with angel eyes tonight?

So drink up, all of you people
Order anything you see
And have fun you happy people
The drink and the laugh's on me

Pardon me, but I gotta run
The fact's uncommonly clear
I gotta find who's now the number one
And why my angel eyes ain't here
'Scuse me, while I disappear
The torch I carry is handsome
It's worth its heartache in ransom

And when the twilight steals
I know how the lady in the harbor feels

When I want rain, I get sunny weather
I'm just as blue as the sky
Since love is gone, can't pull myself together
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry

Friends ask me out, and I tell them I'm busy
Must get a new alibi
I stay at home, and ask myself "Where is she?"
Guess I'll hang my tears out to dry

Dry little tear drops, my little tear drops
Hanging on a stream of dreams
Fly, little mem'ries, my little mem'ries
Remind her of our crazy schemes
Yes, somebody said "Just forget about her"
So I gave that treatment a try
And strangely enough, I got along without her
Then one day she passed me right by
Oh well
I guess I'll hang my tears out to dry
Each place I go only the lonely go
Some little small café
The songs I know only the lonely know
Each melody recalls a love that used to be

The dreams I dream only the lonely dream
Of lips as warm as May
That hopeless scheme only the lonely scheme
That soon somewhere you'll find the one that used to care

And you recall each fun time
Those picnics at the beach when love was new
It well could be the one time
A hopeless little dream like that comes true

If you find love, hang on to each caress
And never let love go
For when it's gone, you'll know the loneliness
The heartbreak only the lonely know
I'm gonna love you like nobody's loved you
Come rain or come shine
High as a mountain and deep as a river
Come rain or come shine

I guess when you met me
It was just one of those things
But don't you ever bet me
'Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me

You're gonna love me like nobody's loved me
Come rain or come shine
We'll be happy together, unhappy together
Now won't that be just fine?

The days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in or we're out of the money
But I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine

Days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in or we're out of the money
I'm with you, baby
I'm with you rain or shine
The moment I saw her face
I knew she was just my style
My only regret is we've never met
For I dream of her all the while

But she doesn't know I exist
No matter how much I persist
So it's clear to see there's no hope for me
Though I live at 5135 Kensington Avenue
And she lives at 5133

How can I ignore the girl next door
I love her more than I can say
Doesn't try to please me, doesn't even tease me
And she never sees me glance her way

And I thought I'm heartsore, the girl next door
Affection for me won't display
I just adore her, so I can't ignore her
The girl next door
Is it an earthquake or simply a shock?
Is it the good turtle soup or merely the mock?
Is it a cocktail, this feeling of joy?
Or is what I feel the real McCoy?

Is it for all time or simply a lark?
Is it Granada I see or only Asbury Park?
Is it a fancy not worth thinking of?
Or is it at long last love?

Is it an earthquake, or simply a shock?
Is it the good turtle soup, or is it merely the mock?
Is it a cocktail, this feeling of joy?
Or is what I feel the real McCoy?

Is it for all time or simply a lark?
Is it Granada I see or only Asbury Park?
Is it a fancy, not worth thinking of?
Or is it at long long long last love?
The very thought of you
And I forget to do
The little ordinary things
That everyone ought to do

I'm living in a kind of daydream
And I'm as happy as a king
And as foolish though it may seem
To me, that's everything

The mere idea of you
The longing here for you
You'll never know how slow the moments go
Till I'm near to you

I see your face in every flower
Your eyes in stars above
It's just the thought of you
The very thought of you, my love

I see your face in every flower
Your eyes in stars above
It's just the thought of you
The very thought of you, my love
Every time it rains, it rains pennies from heaven
Don't you know each cloud contains pennies from heaven?
You'll find your fortune's fallin' all over the town
Be sure that your umbrella is upside down

Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers
If you want the things you love, you must have showers
So, when you hear it thunder, don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven for you and me

Every time, every time it rains, it's gonna rain pennies from heaven
Don't you know every cloud contains lots of pennies from heaven
You'll find your fortune's fallin', baby, all over the town
Be sure, be sure that your umbrella is upside down

Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers
If you want the things you love, you've got to have showers
So, when you hear it thunder, don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven for you and me
Here we all work 'long the Mississippi
Here we all work while the white folk play
Pullin' them boats from the dawn till sunset
Gettin' no rest till the judgment day

Don't look up and don't look down
Ya don't dast make the white boss frown
Bend your knees and bow your head
And pull that rope until you're dead

Let me go 'way from the Mississippi
Let me go 'way from the white man boss
Show me that stream called the River Jordan
That's the old stream that I long to cross

Ol' Man River, that Ol' Man River
He must know somepin', but he don't say nothin'

He just keeps rollin', he keeps on rollin' along

He don't plant taters, and he don't plant cotton
And them what plants 'em is soon forgotten
But Ol' Man River, jest keeps rollin' along
You and me, we sweat and strain
Bodies all achin' and wracked with pain
Tote that barge and lift that bale
Ya get a little drunk and ya lands in ja-ail

I gets weary and so sick of tryin'
I'm tired of livin', but I'm feared of dyin'
And Ol' Man River, he just keeps rollin' along
They call you lady luck
But there is room for doubt
At times you have a very un-lady-like way
Of running out
You're on this date with me
The pickin's have been lush
And yet before the evening is over
You might give me the brush
You might forget your manners
You might refuse to stay
And so the best that I can do is pray
Luck be lady tonight
Luck be lady tonight
Luck if you've been a lady to begin with
Luck be a lady tonight
Luck let a gentleman see
Just how nice a dame you can be
I know the way you've treated other guys you've been with
Luck be a lady with me
A lady never leaves her escort
It isn't fair, it isn't nice
A lady doesn't wander all over the room
And blow on some other guy's dice
Lets keep this party polite
Never get out of my sight
Stick with me baby, I'm the guy that you came in with
Luck be lady tonight
A lady never flirts with strangers
She'd have a heart, she'd be nice
A lady doesn't wander all over the room
And blow on some other guys dice
Lets keep this party polite
Never get out of my sight
Stick with me baby, I'm the guy that you came in with
Luck be lady tonight
Out of the tree of life I just picked me a plum
You came along and everything's startin' to hum
Still, it's a real good bet, the best is yet to come

Best is yet to come and babe, won't that be fine?
You think you've seen the sun, but you ain't seen it shine

A-Wait till the warm-up's underway
Wait till our lips have met
And wait till you see that sunshine day
You ain't seen nothin' yet

The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?
Best is yet to come, come the day you're mine

Come the day you're mine
I'm gonna teach you to fly
We've only tasted the wine
We're gonna drain the cup dry

Wait till your charms are right for these arms to surround
You think you've flown before, but baby, you ain't left the ground
A-Wait till you're locked in my embrace
Wait till I draw you near
A-Wait till you see that sunshine place
Ain't nothin' like it here

The best is yet to come and babe, won't it be fine?
The best is yet to come, come the day you're mine

Come the day you're mine
And you're gonna be mine

[Verse 1]
One day you turn around and it's summer
Next day you turn around and it's fall
And the springs and the winters of a lifetime
Whatever happened to them all?

[Chorus]
As a man who has always had the wand'ring ways
Now I'm reaching back for yesterdays
'Til a long-forgotten love appears
And I find that I'm sighing softly as I near
September, the warm September of my years

[Verse 2]
As a man who has never paused at wishing wells
Now, I'm watching children's carousels
And their laughter's music to my ears
And I find that I'm smiling gently as I near
September, the warm September of my years
The golden, warm September of my years

[Verse 1]
I stand at your gate and the song that I sing is of moonlight
I stand and I wait for the touch of your hand in the June night
The roses are sighing a Moonlight Serenade

[Verse 2]
The stars are aglow and tonight how their light sets me dreaming
My love, do you know that your eyes are like stars brightly beaming?
I bring you and I sing you a Moonlight Serenade

[Bridge]
Let us stray 'till break of day in love's valley of dreams
Just you and I, a summer sky, a heavenly breeze kissin' the trees

[Verse 3]
So don't let me wait, come to me tenderly in the June night
I stand at your gate and I sing you a song in the moonlight
A love song, my darling, a Moonlight Serenade

[Frank Sinatra]
Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
Each one she passes goes "ah"

[Frank Sinatra]
When she walks, she's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes, each one she passes goes  "ooh"

[Frank Sinatra]
But I watch her so sadly
How can I tell her I love her
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me

[Frank Sinatra]
Tall, (and) tan, (and) young, (and) lovely, the girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, I smile but she doesn't see
(doesn't see)

[Antonio Carlos Jobim]
Olha que coisa mais linda mais cheia de graça
Ela menina que vem e que passa
Num doce balanço a caminho do mar

[Antonio Carlos Jobim]
Moça do corpo dourado do sol de ipanema
O seu balançado mais que um poema
A coisa mais linda que eu j vi passar..

[Frank Sinatra]
Ooh, but I watch her so sadly

[Antonio Carlos Jobim]
Ah, Porque tudo to triste

[Frank Sinatra]
Yes, I would give my heart gladly

[Frank Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim]
But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me

[Frank Sinatra]
Tall, tan, young, lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, I smile but she doesn't see

[Antonio Carlos Jobim]
Por causa do amor

[Frank Sinatra]
She just doesn't see

[Antonio Carlos Jobim]
Nem olha para mim

[Frank Sinatra]
She never sees me

[Antonio Carlos Jobim]
Por causa do amor
Drinkin' again and thinkin' of when, when you loved me
I'm havin' a few and wishin' that you were here

Makin' the rounds, accepting a round from strangers
Bein' a fool just hopin' that you'll appear

Sure, I can borrow a smoke, maybe tell some joker a bad joke
But nobody laughs, they don't laugh at a broken heart

Oh, yeah, I'm drinkin' again, it's always the same
That same old story
After the kicks there's little old mixed-up me
Tryin' to lose a dream that used to be

Look at me, I'm drinkin' again, drinkin' all over town
Yeah, I'm drinkin' again
Over and over I keep going over the world we knew
Once when you walked beside me
That inconceivable, that unbelievable world we knew
When we two were in love

And every bright neon sign turned into stars
And the sun and the moon seemed to be ours
Each road that we took turned into gold
But the dream was too much for you to hold

Now over and over I keep going over the world we knew
Days when you used to love me

And every bright neon sign turned into stars
And the sun and the moon seemed to be ours
Each road that we took, it turned into gold
But the dream was too much for you to hold

Now over and over I keep going over the world we knew
Days when you used to love me
Over and over I keep going over the world we knew
So I'm down and so I'm out
But so are many others
So I feel like tryin' to hide
My head 'neath these covers
Life is like the seasons
After winter comes the spring
So I'll keep this smile awhile
And see what tomorrow brings

I've been told and I believe
That life is meant for livin'
And even when my chips are low
There's still some left for givin'
I've been many places
Maybe not as far as you
So I think I'll stay awhile
And see if some dreams come true

There isn't much that I have learned
Through all my foolish years
Except that life keeps runnin' in cycles
First there's laughter, then those tears
But I'll keep my head up high
Although I'm kinda tired
My gal just up and left last week
Friday I got fired
You know it's almost funny
But things can't get worse than now
So I'll keep on tryin' to sing
But please, just don't ask me how
So close your eyes, for that's a lovely way to be
Aware of things your heart alone was meant to see
The fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream together

You can't deny, don't try to fight the rising sea
Don't fight the moon, the stars above and don't fight me
The fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream together

When I saw you first the time was half past three
When your eyes met mine it was eternity

By now we know the wave is on it's way to be
Just catch the wave, don't be afraid of loving me
The fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream together

When I saw you first the time was half past three
When your eyes met mine it was eternity

By now we know the wave is on it's way to be
Just catch that wave, don't be afraid of loving me
The fundamental loneliness goes whenever two can dream a dream together
Today I may not have a thing at all
Except for just a dream or two
But I've got lots of plans for tomorrow
And all my tomorrows belong to you

Right now it may not seem like spring at all
We're drifting and the laughs are few
But I've got rainbows planned for tomorrow
And all my tomorrows belong to you

No one knows better than I
That luck keeps passing me by
That's fate
But with you there at my side
I'll soon be turning the tide
Just wait

As long as I've got arms that cling at all
It's you that I'll be clinging to
And all the dreams I dream, beg, or borrow
On some bright tomorrow
They'll all come true
And all my bright tomorrows belong to you

[Verse 1]
In this lonely world, in this cold cold world
Where champions were made to fight
And lonely hearts were made just to love you
And thieves were meant to steal all of the above

[Chorus]
I got blood on my hands, blood on my hands, blood on my hands
I got blood on my hands, blood on my hands, blood on my hands

[Pre-Chorus]
I was naked in the waves, you were laughing in the distance
I was screaming out to you, but you never seem to listen
We both set out to sea, we were rocking in the waves
And you prayed my boat would sink, and you lead me to the grave

[Chorus]
And now there's blood on my, blood on my, blood on my hands
There's blood on my, blood on my, blood on my hands, yeah

[Verse 2]
We're falling, almost feels like we're flying
Let the stars guide you to love, but thieves were meant to steal all of the above

[Chorus]
I got blood on my hands, blood on my hands, blood on my hands
I got blood on my hands, blood on my hands, blood on my hands

[Pre-Chorus]
I was naked in the waves, you were laughing in the distance
I was screaming out to you, but you never seem to listen
We both set out to sea, we were rocking in the waves
And you prayed my boat would sink,and you lead me to the grave

[Chorus]
Now there's blood on my, blood on my, blood on my hands
There's blood on my, blood on my, blood on my hands
Now there's blood on my, blood on my, blood on my hands
There's blood on my, blood on my, blood on my hands

[Pre-Chorus]
I was naked in the waves, you were laughing in the distance
I was screaming out to you, but you never seem to listen
We both set out to sea, we were rocking in the waves
And you prayed my boat would sink, and you lead me to the grave
I was naked in the waves, you were laughing in the distance
I was screaming out to you, but you never seem to listen
We both set out to sea, we were rocking in the waves
And you prayed my boat would sink, and you lead me to the grave

[Chorus]
Now there's blood on my, blood on my, blood on my hands
There's blood on my, blood on my, blood on my hands
Now there's blood on my, blood on my, blood on my hands
There's blood on my, blood on my, blood on my hands

[Verse 1]
Is it true?
You’ve been feeling sort of low these days
Just don’t have a place to go these days
Must be bringing you down

[Pre-Chorus]
If it’s so
Then come on give this lover boy a try
I’ll put the sparkle right back in your eyes
What could you lose?

[Chorus]
Well for one, her heart belongs to another
And no other heart will do

[Verse 2]
Is it wrong
To think my love could really help you out?
It’s simply just my stubborn heart no doubt, rambling away

[Pre-Chorus 2]
If it’s not
Then come on give this lover boy a try
I’ll put the sparkle right back in your eyes
What could you lose?

[Chorus]
Well for one, her heart belongs to another
And no other heart will do
For one, her heart belongs to another
And no other heart will do

[Outro]
Ohhh
Ah

[Verse 1: Rome Fortune]
The coolest mother funker on the planet
The sky is falling caught that shit and handed it to you
And I was mad about your other man that
I was blinded at the time and didn't quite know what to do
Voodoo you know
I've removed your soul
Let you keep your glow
So outside this we'll never notice

[Hook: Rome Fortune]
She said my soul is pitch black
Breaking hearts like back to back to back
Universal react
She know that I ain't never mad at that
Never mad at that
Never mad at that
Never mad at that
Never never

[Verse 2: Rome Fortune]
The sadest mother funker on the planet
My head was hard as granite I didn't pick up on the clues
Fishing for any optimism
It didn't click until I had my moment sitting without you
True fools do learn
But this time I skip my turn
Treat heartbreak like heartburn
So I die just to keep me focused
I'm Biggie Biggie, baby
Hypnotize your eyes after one more chance
Don't you ever miss him baby
Minimize the size of our lives and lies
And I want to talk it out
My brain, and my 

[?], and my past told me walk it out

[Hook: Rome Fortune]
She said my soul is pitch black
Breaking hearts like back to back to back
Universal react
She know that I ain't never mad at that
Never mad at that
Never mad at that
Never mad at that

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Give up my life for the rhythm
For the beat of a heart
Like hers
Start it over to the rhythm
To the beat of a heart
Like hers

[Chorus]
And believe me
I've been waiting for her
Believe me
I've been waiting for her

[Verse 2]
Listen closely for the rhythm
To the beat of a heart
Like hers
Could I quit it?
Start it over
To the beat of a heart
Like hers

[Chorus]
And believe me
I've been waiting for her
Believe me
I've been waiting for her
Believe me
I've been waiting for her
Believe me
I've been waiting for her

[Outro]

[Verse 1]
Done, done is all the love, love that I had saved for you
Gone, gone with my heart, locked inside a cage for you
And what's this that has become, has become of poor old me
Tried, so hard to believe in something that will never be

[Chorus]
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a  heart like hers again
Never believe

[Verse 2]
All, all that I could give, all I had to offer her
Is gone, simply locked away, no longer there to bother her
Now look, look at what's become, what's become of poor old me
Tried, so hard to believe in something that will never be

[Chorus]
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a  heart like hers again
Never believe
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe in a heart like hers again
Never believe

[Verse 1]
Will she love me again tomorrow
I don't know, don't think so
And that's fine, fine by me
As long as, long as I know she's happy, happy

[Chorus]
Without me
Without me
Without me
Without me

[Verse 2]
Will she find love again tomorrow
I don't know, I hope so
And that's fine, fine by me
As long as, long as I know she's happy, happy

[Chorus]
Without me
Without me
Without me
Without me

[Verse 1]
Birds flying high, you know how I feel
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
Breeze drifting on by, you know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for me, yeah
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for me
And I'm feeling good

[Verse 2]
Fish in the sea, you know how I feel
River running free, you know how I feel
Blossom on the tree, you know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for me
And I'm feeling good

[Verse 3]
Dragonfly out in the sun, you know what I mean
Don't ya know
Butterflies having fun,, you know what I mean
Sleep in peace when day is done, that's what I mean
And this hold world is a new world
And a bold world for me

[Verse 4]
Stars when you shine, you know how I feel
Scent of a pine, you know how I feel
Oh, freedom is mine and I know how I feel
It's a new dawn, it's a new day
It's a new life for me

[Scatting]
I'm feeling good

Lotta niggas get real mad when they see me come
I'll take your bitch and won't give her back, call that no refund
My block is the park, you can call me Nino
This rock-a-bye baby, when you play with my dinero
Get the green, get the pills, get the lean, you can get the soft
Get the time he's gone get here, not guarantee, I get it off
Ridin' in that foreign car, fuckin' around with them foreign broads
Hoes you fall in love with, I treat 'em all like porn stars
Everywhere I go yes, bitches and niggas feelin' me
Twenty grand on my wrist nigga, my time is money, literally

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Always say you gettin' money like me! What dat mean?

If you buy a dub, make you two dubs, that’s a break down
If you buy a brick, make you two bricks, that’s a break down
Dimes bigger than a giant Now and Later, break down
Rims and tires never drove a mile, it won’t break down

Niggas popping shit, that AK, yeah how that sound?

Bout that money money money money, that’s what you can die from
Lot of niggas die for nothing cause they didn’t have none’

Girl you so fucking fine

I still can’t get you out my mind
I think about you all the time
I recognize you on the grind
Well I still want to make you mine
I want to fuck you from behind
I want to kiss you one more time
We broke up, felt like I’m dying
I said I didn’t but I was lying
Baby remember how we shine
We never once stood in a line
We smoking kush and sipping wine
My bitch so motherfucking fly
Look, we smoking kush and sipping wine

She used to be my ride or die
But fly little butterfly, fly, fly

But baby girl so do I

[Verse 2: RiFF RAFF]
Hair by Versace, jump out the big body
Pomegranate Maserati, seats green, Wasabi
Tiger blood and emblems, rose gold from dentist
Massage by Liz Claiborne, collect call from Maury
Married life is boring, my house is four stories
Tell ghost stories to Coly, then on planes in France
Two months in advance, shower big enough for eight
Pour a seven in my grape Fanta, second glance, diamonds dancing
Diamonds dancing in New Hampshire

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
She used to be my ride or die
I want to look her in her eyes
And tell her fly fly fly
I know you living in the sky
But baby girl so do I
You balling hard and so do I
I think it’s time you recognize

[Hook: Barry, Robin & Maurice Gibb]
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by, I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain and harder to climb

[Verse 1: Barry Gibb]
Ooh, you and me, girl got a lot of love in store
And it flows through you
And it flows through me
And I love you so much more

[Verse 2: Barry Gibb]
Then my life, I can see beyond forever
Everything we are will never die
Love is such a beautiful thing
Oh, you make my world a summer day
Are you just a dream to fade away?

[Hook: Barry, Robin & Maurice Gibb]
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by, I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain and harder to climb

[Verse 3: Barry Gibb]
You and me, girl, got a highway to the sky
We can turn away
From the night and day
And the tears you had to cry

[Verse 4: Barry Gibb]
You're my life, I can see a new tomorrow
Everything we are will never die
Love is such a beautiful thing
When you are to me the light above
Made for all to see our precious love

[Hook: Barry, Robin & Maurice Gibb]
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by, I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain and harder to climb

[Interlude]
Love is such a beautiful thing
You make my world a summer day
Are you just a dream to fade away

[Hook: Barry, Robin & Maurice Gibb]
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by, I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as wide as a river and harder to climb

[Outro]
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by, I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain and harder to climb

Nobody gets too much heaven no more
It's much harder to come by, I'm waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
It's as high as a mountain and harder to climb...

[Verse 1]
Straight from the East side
Blood gang, we heavy
Fuck nigga, dare me
I turn into Freddy
My fingers machetes
Trap house jumpin' like Monta Ellis
We trap out the 'telly when we outta town
Uzi on deck
Phone ringin' off the hook, bitch, that's the plug
Ocean view bedroom, baby
See through showers and I just put some fish in my tub
Hold up, I ain't playin'
Niggas say they rich, I say "And?"
Same old song, I ain't dance
Heater on my waist, hotter than a frying pan
If you don't see what I'm sayin'
I give your ass a fuckin' eye exam
I ain't playin'
Guns in my hands, I ain't prayin'
Fireman spittin' venom, Spiderman, I'm enhanced
I’m at peace, joggin' pants cost at least about a grand
I'm advanced like Japan
Got more sand than Sudan, Lord

[Bridge]
And life ain't nothin' but a long day
And tomorrow ain't nothin' but a long way away
You know that haters come in all sizes, all shapes, 'kay
That's why I had to get a little more trunk space
Got insurance on the trap house, Allstate
Got the trap house pumpin' like a heart rate
Got the trap house pumpin' like a 808
Boom, like a 808

[Verse 2]
I could fly around that bitch, need a tarmac
I just landed in Cuba, need a straw hat
I gotta get the raw back, I need a format
I put the shit on horseback and start my own ranch
From where they don't talk smack, they just snort smack
I'll turn your head to an open hot sauce pack
I tell the bitch some true lies and some false facts
Boy, I'm drownin' in the syrup like a short stack
Ooh, 187, 211
Hockey mask on, Wayne Gretzky
Stunt my ass off, chain heavy
Your bitch get passed on, chain letter
Train smoker, smoke plain, never
Had a date with the Devil
Then I changed schedules
I'm a trained killer
Like a paid killer
Better yet, Saddam Hussein nephew
Nigga, no love
That's from the bottom of my heart
I pull up and paint your whole fucking block red
Then get out of my car and admire my art
Then smile at my thoughts
My bitch from Atlanta got eyes like a hawk
She see why I'm a boss
I just got another speeding ticket on the Bugatti
While it was parked
Now I don't wan' talk, bitch, I don't wan' talk
Lean in my punch, I decided to spar
Anybody want war?
I'm excited to start
Get indicted tomorrow
I be out by the morn
Before I even yawn
Stay in ya lane, I remind these lil' boys
This is victory lane, now do I need a horn?
The struggle is real, and the Bible too long
I'm writing my will, and I'm typing my won'ts
Lord, please
Kilos, OZ's
'Cause my bitch high class, she like Pinot and cheese
I dropped out of class so I'm zero degrees
I can out-think a shrink, she can deep throat a tree
I can hijack a Brinks, so my sweet soda pink
I'm a freak show to freaks
I'm spitting these bars, hope my bar tab is cheap
I'm a hard man to reach
I'm newborn and deceased
I'm too hard for this beat
I'm the heart and the beat
The Chong and the Cheech
My blunt long as a speech
Roach look like a leech
I'm too long for the brief
I'm too wrong for the priest
With this chrome on your teeth
That get blown out your cheek
Like my bitch mixed, like Long Island Tea
She don't hide her figure, she don't hide her feet
I'm the head nigga, like Prodigy
And bitch, I'ma shine, like Connery
Yeah

[Outro]
And life ain't nothin' but a long day
Tomorrow ain't nothin' but a long way, away
Ms. Backseat Love

Like this shit crazy, nigga
That head top was crazy, I'm tryna go up
Ya feel me, nigga?
The Gut Feeling

[Verse]
As I stand on my toes, playin' my boss
My foot leg in the snow cold
As the window brim when it breeze and it blow
Try to live like Christ in the image of 'em
But life with these niggas from a lost breed, double crossin' thoughts to breed in
Droppin' out with no job, made it hard to succeed, fuck
I'm puttin' in work but I'm stuck
I'm pushin' this work but it sucks
Down in that third like my worth made bucks, fuck it
I'm livin' amongst rugged niggas that go fuck with niggas
With fuckin' digits and as long as they surround your kin
Come and kick it, oh fuck with the one
Nothin' under this sun exquisite
Sink into my stomach as I laugh and brag with some of my youngiin's from this rotten onion
Just the thought alone that shawty havin' my phone and number
Hit my call, I knew that there was more in store for me
The rock inside, I knew that it was more important for me
10, but ain't this who I am?
Convincin' myself dear mama, wasn't gon' tell 'em that
She got them rolled on and drop low's, exploded 4's on 'em
I know she knows wussup, nowhere to go but up

What a beautiful thought I am thinking
Concerning the great speckled bird
And to know that my name is recorded
On the pages of God's holy word

Desiring to lower her standards
They watch every move that she makes
They long to find fault with her teaching
But really she makes no mistakes

I am glad I have learned of her meekness
I am glad that my name is on her book
For I want to be one never fearing
The face of my Saviour to look

And when He come up descending from Heaven
On a cloud like He said in His word
I'll be joyfully carried to meet Him
On the wings of the great speckled bird
I said my niggas be rollin on sour sippin on schamp(boss)
Cause it ain't shit but young bosses in my camp
Certified goon 100 on my stamp
Got that haters throwin shade cause I'm shinen like a lamp
Shinen like a lamp, sh-shinen like a lamp
You see tha haters throwin shade cause I'm shinen like a lamp
Shinen like a lamp, sh-shinen like a lamp
Me and P-Mon in the caddy and we be slidin like a ramp

[yeaa]
I get it like this like that
That purple shit that I be slangin sticky like mice traps
I take a lost but I don't fall I'm a get right back
I drop tha oils in the water and it just might

I get it like this like that
That purple shit that I be slingin stickin like mice traps
I take a lost but I don't fall I'm a get right back
I drop them oils in the water and it just might crack
Said it just mite snap, yea it jus mite jump
Shit I mite jus hit it hard and come up jus like luck
I got these bitches in my face and said they jus like bumps
So I pop them and watch them fade away at a player rage
I be a-ok kickin it like an 808

[kickin it]
Cause I get, if I dont got it I make a way
Natural born hustla, ever since a youngin I been all about dat double up
Ya'll was playin double dutch, runnin with the girls I was
I was watchin for the d-boys and how they make they sales
Now I do it well, I learned from the realest
If it ain't about no money then it ain't about me nigga
I gotta bop like this, can't wear skinny jeans cause my Glock won't fit
No one on the corner got a swagga like dis
When I step up in the hood I be good real shit
Jus me no goon, r/t go vroom, got dem multi-colored diamonds lookin like a cartoon
See dem haters lookin at me wanna stick me harpoon
But I'm strizzy with dat glizzy put nigga on snooze (sleep)
Fresh like Manny be, I said the rolly face blue like a zanny be
I'm here now, they like can he be? Filght attendants
With the haters had planned for me, more money is what the maker had planned for me
But I'm back and watch the whole hood chant for me, I'm back now watch the whole hood chant for me
But I'm back
Ooo girl you nasty
Ooo girl you nasty
Ooo girl you nasty
Ooo girl you nasty
Ooo girl you nasty

She just wanna do it all day she don't even take a breather
She just wanna walk around my place in my wife beater
She just wanna do it all day she don't even take a breather
She just wanna walk around my place in my wife beater

She's a nymphomaniac
Brainiac
Literally the smartest and the taken fact
She like girls so every girl is her theme song
She jump up on that dick and get her trampoline on
I'm tryna tell her how sexy she look wit cream on
And all she wanna know is why I still got my jeans on
Bounce till the springs gone
Ride ya till you can't continue
Head board of the bead banging like a gang member
And when I gotta headache I don't do the normal nursin'
When my skull hurtin' yea she my skull surgeon
She don't care if she get her hair or her neck pulled
She could go all night her heart pumps red bull
She just wanna do it all day she don't even take a breather
She just wanna walk around my place in my wife beater
She just wanna do it all day she don't even take a breather
She just wanna walk around my place in my wife beater

Wild wild west dough, though them girls white
Really give that best dome
Do do head, suck me dead
Leave that coffin wet, rub this lube up on yo chest
Playin wit yo tittie pierced, feelin like a kid again
Let the mammal in, hump ya like a camel skin
Into her lions den, Tyga dawg in this bitch
Woof woof like clifford no comic sh! t
She open it but bite them lips like piranhas heads
Put yo face way down, youz a gold digga
Sayin' flippa no city but that ass bigga
Young money n! gga, we don't know none these n! ggas
His girlfriend da only thing I remember ca-cause

She just wanna do it all day she don't even take a breather
She just wanna walk around my place in my wife beater
She just wanna do it all day she don't even take a breather
She just wanna walk around my place in my wife beater

She got stamina, she got endurance
She drive my d! ck crazy, I need insurance
She got stretch marks, cause she got children
Them bitches like soulja boy, they be round the house
YOU'RE IN!!
We never fuck in a bed that smell like urine (uuuhhh)
I'm getting my d! ck sucked, what're you doin?
She's a nympho, she done f*cked all my kin folks
She'll fuck ya 14 weeks straight, copy that? 10-4
She f*ck like a porn star, be bouncin' like a bad check
Head goin' up and down like hydraulics in her neck
Tee shirt with no panties on
She throw it back with no pain
And I ain't talkin' no domestic violence
But she'll take your wife beater
I don't know what to tell ya
Ca ca can't answer the phone I'mma have to email ya
She up in the spot, I just beat it round the clock
Wife beater and some socks, wife beater and some socks
(W-w-w-wife beater and some socks, wife beater and some socks)
C-c-co she up in my spot, co she up in my spot
I just beat her round the clock, b b b beat her round the clock
She a nympho, she a nympho

She just wanna do it all day she don't even take a breather
She just wanna walk around my place in my wife beater
She just wanna do it all day she don't even take a breather
She just wanna walk around my place in my wife beater

Ooo girl you nasty

[Verse 1: Turntan]
An opportunistic kind of phase
Laughing about trying to save face at the party
Where all your friends are so cool
Faded off liquor, we found our
Eyelids getting heavier, we shared a brief look and
Just gave ourselves to the night
We'll just fight to be the ones we hate

[Verse 2: Turntan]
We rose in the morning confused by
What we were mourning for some things are better left
In the adolescence of youth
Do me a favor she said
"I'd like you to savor the taste of me on your lips
I swear it's the last that you'll get"

[Chorus: Turntan, Turntan & Stitches]
Grace do you want me
Grace 'til you die
Grace do you want me
Grace 'til you die
Grace do you want me, you know
Grace 'til you die
Grace do you want me, you know
Grace 'til you die
Grace do you want me, you know
Grace 'til you die
Grace do you want me, you know
Grace 'til you die
Grace do you want me, you know
Grace 'til you die
Grace do you want me, you know
Grace do you want me

[Outro: Turntan & Stitches]
Grace do you want me
Grace 'til you die
Grace do you want me
Grace 'til you die
Well, I've wandered around after a hour of work
And I'm waiting to meet her for weeks
The ghost of a girlfriend appear in my room
I can still smell her perfume in my sheets

But that's not her in my bed though she's out on the town
And I don't want anyone to see
There's a tattoo of my name on her body but honestly
The man holding her hand isn't me

Oh honey, how could you regret me
When you can't even forget me?
Babe, it's okay to say that you love me
'Cause I think of you all night long
Still think of you all night long

Oh, okay, say that you love me
I think of you all night long
Still thinking of you all night long

I thought that once you had one, you had every woman
Until I lost this legendary woman
Now I'm sure that they don't make' em like her anymore
So please, baby, please lover
Let's find a way to forgive each other
I've gotten around ever since you've been gone
Without you I'm still alone

Oh, how can you regret me
When you know you can't forget me?
It's okay to say that you love me
'Cause I think of you all night long
Still think of you all night long

Oh it's okay, say that you love me, okay
I think of you all night long
Still thinking of you all night long

I make mistakes, I'm only human
And I am not ashamed to say
That you are the one

Babe, it's okay to say that you love me
'Cause I think of you all night long
Still think of you all night long
Babe, it's okay to say that you love me
'Cause I think of you all night long
Still think of you all night long
And it's okay, all night long
Say that you love me all night long
Ooh, say you love me

[Verse 1]
Ooh baby, not tonight
I don't wanna fuss and fight
I just wanna make it right
Ooh, there's work to do
I wanna get real close to you
I wanna get you in the mood

[Pre-Chorus]
All the things you want to do
Just relax and I'll take care of you
And anytime you want me
I'm sayin' that I love you every day
And I know that you love me, baby, admit it

[Chorus]
Give me all your love and don't stop
My love's waiting when you reach the top (All night long)
Come into my bedroom, honey
What I got will make you spend money (All night long)

[Verse 2]
You know that I know that you love me
So if you just give me a chance, I can still show you romance
I know that you're still savin' for my flavor, babe
So stop playin' hard to get, let's make love like we first met

[Pre-Chorus]
All the things you want to do
Just relax and I'll take care of you
And anytime you want me
I'm sayin' that I love you everyday
And I know that you love me, baby, admit it

[Chorus]
Give me all your love and don't stop
My love's waiting when you reach the top (All night long)
Come into my bedroom, honey
What I got will make you spend money (All night long)
And I say...

[Scatting]

[Chorus]
Give me all your love and don't stop
My love's waiting when you reach the top (All night long)
Come into my bedroom, honey
What I got will make you spend money (All night long)
Give me all your love and don't stop
My love's waiting when you reach the top (All night long)
Come into my bedroom, honey
What I got will make you spend money (All night long)

[Scatting]

[Chorus]
Come into my bedroom, honey
What I got will make you spend money (All night long)
Give me all your love and don't stop

[Verse 1:]
All I need is one mic all I need is one stove
Homie got a nice flow but gucci got that white coke
You ain't gettin the right dope, you knockin on the wrong door
Last nigga tried me let's just callem john doe
And since you short a dime homie then park me a old school
I fronted you, you ran off that's not what you're supposed to do
I'm gettin my tip fade cut pour the chris and flat show
Wish a nigga would run up on me like I'm bristol
Yeaaaaa
Gucci mans a live watt
Try me like I'm yung berg and I'm a make yo eyes cry
Gucci like to drank and gucci like to smoke
And gucci on a rise while ya'll niggas goin broke
GUCCI! gucci mans a g, tell me sumthin I don't know

I don't fear you cause I'm parrapalegic, wheres my parralegal

[Chorus:]
See that house right there yea make a lot a money

[x2]
What you wanna get homie hurry up and buy it
Dopeboys gone buy you gone get yo self supply

[Verse 2:]
I'm in my M6 beemer
This is no 645
Like a pigeon in the sky, I just shitted on your ride
So much weight off in my house, you would think it was a gym
Plus my nikes match my necklace and my necklace match my rims
I got court in early mornin I don't really wana go
Say I violated probation just because I blew my nose

Blew 300 on my rolce
200 more on the lamb
Million dollars on the crib
Car note, don't know what that is
Gucci, you don't know who that is
Mama that's just gucci man that my boy that's my partna
I'm gucci man biggest fan
Plus she don't know what that is
I'm with that I don't give a damn
If you think I give a fuck you must do not know who I am, gucci

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Mirror Mirror mirror
Whos the realest in the game
Why you ask that stupid question
Boy you know that's gucci mane
East atlanta 6
You know how we roll
I just bought anotha chevy got it right back out the bowl
Tall stacks up in my closet I can't even see my clothes
And my belly get so big I can hardly see my toes
Got a car in my garage I have never ever drove
It's a door black on black phantom I call that bitch dorrough
If she going to the ladies room I guess I'll let her know
I got powder in my living room, so she don't have to stroll
A year ago today, I was sitting in my cell
Where you see yoself in 5 years
A so icey billionare
Gucci

[Chorus]
In the darkness
Before the dawn
In the swirling
Of the storm
When I'm rolling with the punches
And hope is gone
Leave a light, a light on

Millions of miles from home
In the swirling
Swimming on
When I'm rolling with the thunder
But bleed from thorns
Leave a light, a light on
Leave a light, a light on
Everybody groove to the music
Everybody jam, we've been waiting so long
Just can't hold it back no more
Creepin' up and down now
It's time for me to let it go
If you really wanna see
What we can do for you
Send the crazy wildin' static, sing it
Jam 'cause Backstreet's got it
Come now everybody
We've go it goin' on for years
Jam 'cause Backstreet's got it
Come now everybody
We've go it goin' on for years
Well, I'm creepin' up on your left
Straight up funky when I get with you
I get ruthless when I get wet
Keep the party packed in my corner
Tough like to keep the crowd hype
Get up on this just to get right
What you want is what you're gonna get
Backstreet's got the special effects
If you really wanna see
What we can do for you
Send the crazy wildin' static, sing it
Jam 'cause Backstreet's got it
Come now everybody
We've go it goin' on for years
We've got it going on for years
We've been waiting so long
Just can't hold it back no more
Creepin' up and down now
It's time for me to let it go
Jam 'cause Backstreet's got it
Come now everybody
We've go it goin' on for years

[Verse 1: Florence Welch]
You took my heart, and you held it in your mouth
And with a word all my love came rushing out
And every whisper, it's the worst
Emptied out by a single word
There is a hollow in me now

[Chorus: Florence Welch]
So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm trying to hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing

You're giving me such sweet nothing

[Chorus: Florence Welch]
So I put my faith in something unknown
I'm living on such sweet nothing
But I'm trying to hope with nothing to hold
I'm living on such sweet nothing
And it's hard to learn, and it's hard to love
When you're giving me such sweet nothing
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing
You're giving me such sweet nothing
How about making a run for the border
How about me deserving a break today
How about getting some fries with my order
How about finally letting me have it my way

Thank you Burger King
Thank you Dairy Queen
Thank you, thank you KFC

Thank you Pizza Hut
Thank you Taco Bell
Thank you so much Wendy's
Chris Tucker: Oh man! Look at that girl, right there!
Goodness gracious! That girl fine, man!
Look at it, she just too fine! She know she fine too!

She looks good, you're right
Hey, I bet you, can't nobody get that girl

These things I feel for you
But girl, you know it's true
Stay with me
Fulfill my dreams
And I'll be all you need

The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine
You rocked my world
You know you did
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine
In time
I knew that love would bring
Such happiness to me
I tried to keep my sanity
I've waited patiently
Girl, you know it seems
My life is so complete
A love that's true because of you
Keep doing what you do
Think that I
Finally found the perfect love I've searched for all my life
(Searched for all my life)
Think I'd find
Such a perfect love that's awesomely so right

Baby, baby, baby
It's you and me
You and me
You and me
You rock my world
You rock my world
You rock my world
We took it all apart but I'm wishing I'd stayed
In the back room something I heard you say
We didn't wanna call it too early
Now it seems a world away but I miss that day
Are we ever gonna feel the same?

Standing in the light till it's over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know you, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back
We'll be coming back for you one day

You can see it from afar, we were riding that wave
Blinded by the lights, and it's something I crave
We didn't want to call it too early
Now it seems a world away but I miss that day
Are we ever gonna feel the same?
Standing in the light till it's over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know you, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day

Gonna rise, gonna fall, getting pulled apart
And we all do it all cause it stole our hearts
Gonna light up the skies, so ignore the stars
And we all do it all cause it stole our hearts

Standing in the light till it's over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know you, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day

A dedication to all the refugees worldwide...
One time
Say, say, say

I remember when we used to sit
In the government yard in Brooklyn
Observing the crookedness
As it mingled with the good people we meet
Good friends we had, Good friends we've lost
Along the way
In this great future you can't forget your past
So dry your tears I say And to my peeps who passed away

No woman, no cry, no woman no cry
Say say say

Hey little sister don't shed no tears
No woman no cry
Say say say
I remember when we used to rock
In a project yard in Jersey
And little Georgie would make the firelight
As stolen cars passed through the night
And then we'd hit the corner store
For Roots, paper, and brew
My drink's, my only remedy
For pain of losing family, but while I'm gone Shorty

Everything's gonna be alright, everything's gonna be alright
Fugees come to the dance tonight, everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
O everything's gonna be alright
The gun man's in the house tonight
But everything's gonna be alright

Oh ah oh ah

Good friends we had Oh good friends we've lost

Taking off in a Coup De Ville
Now buckled up on Navy

I don't care what my momma says
(She don't care what her momma says)
No, I'm gonna have this baby
(No, she's gonna have my baby)
Taking all I have to take
This takin' is gonna shape me

People call us renegades
'Cause we like living crazy
We like taking on the town
'Cause people's getting lazy

I don't care what nobody says
No, I'm going to be her lover
Always mad and usually drunk
But I love her like no other
And the doctor says he don't know
Where we gonna go?
I'm a ghost and I don't think I quite know
Where we're gonna go?
Where we're gonna go?
Where we're gonna go?
Where we're gonna go?
Where we're gonna go?
Where we're gonna go?
Where we're gonna go?
Where we're gonna go?

People call us renegades
'Cause we like living crazy
We like taking on this town
'Cause people's getting lazy

I don't care what nobody says
No, I'm going to be her lover
Always mad and usually drunk
But I love her like no other

And her daddy says he don't know
Where we gonna go?
I'm a ghost and I don't think I quite know
Where we gonna go?
Where we gonna go?
Where we gonna go?

[Ab-Soul]
Fuck Black hippy nigga, I invented the recipe

It's a beautiful day I guess for a bitch to roll with Ab-Soul I guess
Pretty Chick let me see them breast
E.T. OG from the weed clinic (Soulo)
Solo but I'm never alone (that's right)
I stay high and I'm powerful (Soulo)
Westside (easy call) I got three eyes man I see y'all
All I do is kill shit ICU, party with a few girls at USC
It's 82 degrees and my top off
And they top off, I'm getting topped off, Top Dawg
Women, weed, and weather what more can I say
To live and die in LA
Spend a week on Venice beach -
I'm 2Pac and Biggie Smalls

[Schoolboy Q]
Every morning nigga I get blazed (aye);
Women, weed, and weather nigga if you bored
Come and join the wave (aye);
Girl, what is your name
Cause I'm feeling your frame
Can I see what you bout (uh);
A little something in your rear
Little something in your mouth
Little something on your couch (uh);
Know now what I'm talkin' about, bring the coffin out
Cause I killed it, I done drilled it
She said she like it from the back like a real bitch (uh)
She swallowed my pride, I damn near cried
Yo, I can't reply, she curled my toes and crossed my eyes
But when you got the recipe its no surprise
Bad hoes panties get left behind - I want your behind

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar (Dr. Dre)]
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
Texas I be screwed up, Chi town I be really pimping
But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living
Women, weed and weather (they come for)
Women, weed and weather
For the women, weed and weather
(from all around the world for the)
Women, weed and weather
Got that women, weed and weather -
Don't it sound clever, come and play
Wh-What more can I say? Welcome to LA

[Kendrick Lamar]
My nigga said he wanna fly out to get him, some
Three W's only for a three day, run
Bitch, take them motherfuckin' panties off, you ain't no, nun (shit)
I be living in the sky every time I ride by them hoes
Ribbon in the sky on the radio cause Stevie know I control
Let it breathe, I control, California living 'til I am old
You want to be one
To peak on the chart, so the peons can be gone
And pee on their hearts
She in the coupe, she in the Neon
Cause she on the BS before we can start
Fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga
Let 'em know the priority order me
Hennessy and for my niggas OG Killa, call it Jason Voorhees
Boy he's on his job
Boy he sure be having the marks on they mark
Pretty bitches and tire marks, let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts
Let 'em reveal how much it cost for this life controlling my vice
No way hell no, uh uh, if I'm wrong I don't wanna be right
We want to be one, to peak on the chart
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
Women, weed, weather, it's not my fault
Then it's 82 degrees and my top peeled, off

[Chorus]

[Jay Rock]
Jay Rock got the recipe, fly hoes wanna roll I guess (I guess)
Everybody know I got that yola, ask (Keisha) she'll confess
I wake up then I bake up with a bad bitch she ain't got on
(No Make Up) (uh)
Medicated, please my nigga no telling
Where the high gonna take us, uh
Three w's, I'm at the W, she got double D's
Bout to bring trouble through
OG, Hennessy get their panties wet
I'm trying to dive in the (Swimming Pool)
Left stroke, right stroke

That stroke can smoke all down her throat
And we blows all kinds of dro
Cali got the best so act like you know, nigga

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

Hell yea, make you put yo hands up, put yo put yo hands up
Hell yea, make you put yo hands up, put yo put yo hands up

[Chorus]
Lookin' back on when I was a little nappy headed boy
Then my only worry was for Christmas what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes would not get a thing
We were happy with the joy the day would bring

Sneaking out the back door to hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door with, "Boy, thought I told you not to go outside!"
Tryin' your best to bring the water to your eyes
Thinkin' it might stop her from woopin' your behind

I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days e-ver have to go?
I wish those days could, come back once more
Why did those days e-ver have to go?
'Cause I love them so

Brother says he's tellin' 'bout you playin' doctor with that girl
Just don't tell, an' I'll give you anythin' you want in this whole wide world
Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy, after church is through
Smokin' cigarettes, writing something nasty on the wall (You nasty boy!)
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall
You grow up and learn that kinda thing ain't right
But while you were doin' it it sure felt outta sight

I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days e-ver have to go?
I wish those days could, come back once more
Why did those days e-ver have to go?
Speech has allowed the communication of ideas
Enabling human beings to work together, to build the impossible
Mankind's greatest achievements have come about by talking

Our greatest hopes could become reality in the future
With the technology at our disposal, the possibilities are unbounded

All we need to do is make sure we keep talking
Hello

Oh!
Oooooh
I love the way you walk into the room
By the shining light in up the place
And when you talk everybody stop
Because they know you know just what you're sayin'
The way that you protect your friends
Baby, I respect you for that
And when you roll you take everyone you love along
I love that shit

Don't fly me away
You don't need to buy a diamond key
To unlock my heart
You shelter my soul
You're my fire when I'm cold
I want you to know...

You had me at hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
You had me at hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
It was many years ago (Ago)
Baby, when you stole my cool
Cuz you had me at hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
Hello oooooh
I get so excited when you travel with me, baby
While I'm on my grind
And never will I ever let my hustle
Come between me and my family time and...
You keep me humble out of this hype
Cuz you know there's more to life
And if I need ya, you will be here
You will make the sacrifice

Don't fly me away
You don't need to buy a diamond key
To unlock my heart
You shelter my soul
You're my fire when I'm cold
I want you to know...

You had me at hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
You had me at hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)

Hello oooooh
Gotta feel you
And be near you
You're the air that I breathe to survive
Gotta hold you
Want to show you
That without you my sun doesn't shine
You don't have to try so... hard for me to love you
Boy without you my life just ain't the same
You don't have to try so... hard for me to love you

You had me at hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
You had me at hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
Hello (Hello)
It was many years ago (Ago)
When you stole my cool
You had me at hello (Hello)

[Instrumentals]

Remember when you were young?
You shone like the sun
Shine on you crazy diamond!
Now there's a look in your eyes
Like black holes in the sky
Shine on you crazy diamond!

You were caught on the cross fire of childhood and stardom
Blown on the steel breeze
Come on, you target for faraway laughter
Come on, you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine!

You reached for the secret too soon
You cried for the moon
Shine on you crazy diamond!
Threatened by shadows at night
And exposed in the light
Shine on you crazy diamond!
Well you wore out your welcome with random precision
Rode on the steel breeze
Come on you raver, you seer of visions
Come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine!

Nobody knows where you are, how near or how far
Shine on you crazy diamond
Pile on many more layers and I'll be joining you there
Shine on you crazy diamond
And we'll bask in the shadow of yesterday's triumph, and sail on the steel breeze
Come on you boy child, you winner and loser
Come on you miner for truth and delusion, and shine!

Yo, I ain't seeing you in a minute, but I got something to tell ya, listen

See the thing about you that caught my eye
Is the same thing that makes me change my mind
Kinda hard to explain, but girl, I'll try
You need to sit down this may take a while
See this girl, she sorta looks just like you
She even smiles just the way you do
So innocent she seemed but I was fooled
I'm reminded when I look at you

You remind of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You wouldn't believe all of the things that she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you

Thought that she was the one for me
Til I found out she was on her creep
Oh, she was sexing everyone, but me
This is why we could never be
You remind of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You wouldn't believe all of the things that she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you

I know it's so unfair to you
That I relate her ignorance to you
Wish I knew, wish I knew how to separate the two
You remind me, whoa...

You remind of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You wouldn't believe all of the things that she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you

You remind of a girl, that I once knew
See her face whenever I, I look at you
You wouldn't believe all of the things that she put me through
This is why I just can't get with you
Ooh no no, no no no no

I got two-dozen roses, and a card that says
"Baby, I can't wait to see you later"
We made dinner reservations, at Nobu, Mr. Chow's
You just pick the location

Now were sitting at the table
Sippin the finest wine, having damn good time
I know whats on your mind
I want you, you want me to stop frontin
I know exactly what you, what you wanna

Do it to me, I wanna feel you touch my body baby, body baby
Do it to me, I guarantee you won't regret it
Let me set it out like you ain't never had it
Do it to me I want you to grab me
Talk to me, tell me how you like it
When you want it, when you all up on it ooh
Do it to me, Im gonna give it to you
Im gonna make this a night to remember
Watchin you work the stick in the ride
The motion how you move from 3rd to 5
And imagine what its gon be when we get inside
And you put that ooh wee on me and you work me the same way
Ooh I can't wait

Im tired of thinkin about it, speakin about it
Baby its time to be about it, turn off the lights
Tear off your clothes, jump in the bed and let it flow
Squeezin', holdin, bitin, scratchin, spankin, screamin
Pullin my hair when you need me everything goes, baby when you

Do it to me, I wanna feel you touch my body baby, body baby
Do it to me, I guarantee you won't regret it
Let me set it out like you ain't never had it
Do it to me I want you to grab me
Talk to me, tell me how you like it
When you want it, when you all up on it ooh
Do it to me, Im gonna give it to you
Im gonna make this a night to remember

So long I waited for this night to get inside you
Look in your eyes and tell you baby, take me Im yours
And if you feel anything like I feel by the end of the night
Im certain youll be screamin for more
I wanna do anything and everything to your body
Till you break down can't take no more
From the bed to the floor, to the top of the stairs
You gonna get it baby, please, please, oh do it to me

Do it to me, I wanna feel you touch my body baby, body baby
Do it to me, I guarantee you won't regret it
Let me set it out like you ain't never had it
Do it to me I want you to grab me
Talk to me, tell me how you like it
When you want it, when you all up on it ooh
Do it to me, Im gonna give it to you
Im gonna make this a night to remember
Hey I'm your life
I'm the one who takes you there
Hey I'm your life
I'm the one who cares
They, They betray
I'm your only true friend now
They, They'll betray
I'm forever there
I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Sad but true
(Fast, fast, fast!)
Sad but true!
You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof's in the way it hurts

For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

You've been so unavailable
Now sadly I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though Lord knows you kept mine

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
I have loved you for many years
Maybe I am just not enough
You've made me realize my deepest fear
By lying and tearing us up

You say I'm crazy
'Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one
And I know...
I know I'm not the only one
Truth hurts

Yeah umm, see it's situations like this
That causes us players to get caught up
In, umm the truth, yeah
What you doin', where you been?

I paged you and you ain't hit me back
And I been callin' and I know
You seen my number on that caller ID, just listen to the words
I got reasons to believe that you've been foolin' around

The way you feel, the past you lived
The, the things you did
It don't matter to me for what it's worth
Just don't lie to me

'Cause that ain't what I need right now
Baby everything we built on trust
You're tearin' it down
'Cause I know the truth hurts
Tell me the truth now
What cha been doin'
And who you been doin' it with?
Truth hurts
Where you been goin'
And how you been puttin' your thing down?

Truth hurts
Whatever you was workin'
I hope that it was worth it baby
Truth hurts
I got reason to believe
That you've been foolin' around

Girl I'm really tryin' hard to understand
I wanna move on and put it in the past
'Cause you claim that you ain't doin' nothin'
Must be my insecurity

It's got the best of me right now
What I know I can't hold inside of me
It's gonna drive me insane
'Cause I know the truth hurts

Tell me the truth now
What cha been doin'
And who you been doin' it with?
Truth hurts
Where you been goin'
And how you been puttin' your thing down?
Truth hurts
Whatever you was workin'
I hope that it was worth it baby
Truth hurts
I got reason to believe
That you've been foolin' around

Sing it with me now
I can't hold on

Now wait a minute, oh, listen baby
The truth is I got this here secret, I've been keeping from you baby
'Cause I know that you gonna tear up the place
Punch me in my face, pull the hot grits out

Think you need to sit down, ho ho
I've been blamin' you when I'm the one that's doin' wrong
I'ma go on a guilty conscience is the real reason I wrote this song
Girl I know the truth hurts, baby

Tell me the truth now
What cha been doin'
And who you been doin' it with?
Truth hurts
Where you been goin'
And how you been puttin' your thing down?
Truth hurts
Whatever you was workin'
I hope that it was worth it baby
Truth hurts
I got reason to believe
That you've been foolin' around

Tell me the truth now
What cha been doin'
And who you been doin' it with?
Truth hurts
Where you been goin'
And how you been puttin' your thing down?

Truth hurts
Whatever you was workin'
I hope that it was worth it baby
Truth hurts

That you've been foolin' around

I hope it's worth it

[Chorus]
I'm a real nigga homie tote six figures only
Gotta pistol you don't want it boy you know what it is
I'm way flyer my pays way higher
If they ever mention sire boy you know what it is
Ain't about drama you don't want no problems
I'll up that Llama boy you know what it is
I get money all I count is big money
Dick is all she get from me boy you know what it is
Ay ay ay ay ay, boy you know what it is
The wait is over here we go again I'm back in the play
I sell another couple mill and take it back to the A
I take another couple mill and put it back in the safe
Five cash for the crib on the back of the lake
I'm up in Crucial 2 stepping with the gat in the waist
T.I. ain't in the street no more fuck ho' dat what they say?
The men trying when you see 'em boy you have to be great
The pistol hit you in the face your teeth they have to replace
That's if you lucky nigga trust me it don't hurt me to take
A 100 thousands to them Haitians you'll be murdered today

[Chorus]
Women sweating when they see me I'm apparently hot
Had the album of the year nigga Grammy or not
Remember all day I used to stand in the spot
With two revolvers in my pocket pitchin' handling rocks
But now chart topping in a car I ain't got
I am the number one customer at my own car lot
You want to know how much money I'm makin' just imagine a lot (10-20)
I'm probably making more than you'd imagine I got (30-40)
Listen closer I need to know if you understand me or not
Because you disrespecting me you and your man will be shot

[Chorus]
Went from the king of the south to the king of the states
Riding in a car you probably never seen in the states
No idea how much yay' I can bring in the states
You can get a hundred on 'em four million a day
Frank Lucas ain't the only one who made a million in a day
But it's an American gangsta right here in your face
And you don't want to see PSC in the scene with AK
You think you runnin' up and robbin' that ain't even the case
Just 'cause you get away that don't mean its OK
You a dead man walkin' and I mean it OK?

[Chorus]

[Instrumental]

[Spoken]
Don't you hate it when that happens?
Little bit of Seinfeld observation
That's called, uh, "Beating Off In A Minor"
Uh, yes, um, A minor... the key... not the felony
Um
Oh yes, a nice gentle applause break for child rape
Or the implications of it
The first steak I ordered
It wasn't very hot
I had to send it back
Let 'em have one more shot

But the second steak I ordered
Well it was lousy too
Now I really hate to say it
But there's one thing that you gotta do

Make me steak number three, yeah
Make me steak number three
Make me steak number three, yeah, yeah, yeah
Make me steak number three
So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
Cuz nothing else matters

Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we do it our way
All these words I don't just say
Cuz nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do, No
Never cared for what they know, No
But I know

So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
Cuz nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do, No
Never cared for what they know, No
Never cared for what they do, No
But I know
Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us, something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters, Oh

So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
Cuz nothing else matters
Cuz nothing else matters

[Chorus]
Why won't you make up your mind?
Give me a sign
Why won't you make up your mind?
Give me a sign
Am I wasting my time living in my head?
You'll be sorry when I make up mine instead

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Why won't you make up your mind?
Give me a sign
Why won't you make up your mind?
Give me a sign
Am I wasting my time living in my head?
You'll be sorry when I make up mine instead
All my niggas take a walk wit me
U ain't gotta holla, u can talk to me
Try to learn where my thoughts could be, and how I stack figures
Learn why im real, s till that nigga
I get money i ain't gotta do a crime, s***
I hit dimes what i need with a 9
Before y'all judge me be clear
We got nothing but heat here
Beware, we here
Whats my name? Got chicks twisted like whats my game
Pimp thing still the same i smash it, i dont harass it
Ma, im a baller i score and pass it
Feel me, still me, filthy
Making hits is a crime i, plead guilty
And this is what we came to do
Party, Diddy, Usher, game is thru
Come on

Its right 'round 11 o'clock, one of your girls just called
Asked u how u look, are u ready
U tell her u look hot, not to worry at all
Niggas will be shook u doing it heavy
Shes telling u she might change but u tell her not to, surely she looks stunning
It'll be fun
The club will be full of game but none of that has got u
Me i think your runnin' 'cause im the one
I dont know what u came to do girl
What u came to do tonight
But i came to party, oh ohh
I dont know what u came to do girl
What u came to do tonight
But i came to party, oh ohh

U're probably thinking to yourself whats the occasion
And belive me girl i dont just search for fun
The perfect gentlemen at every situation
And the only thing thats missing is the one
Is it u??

La la la ghetto girls, la la la suburban girls, la la la international girls
U smell me

Had to take the time, to open up yo mind
Its exactly what u are... OPEN
U got the mesmerizing grind
Your shape should be a crime
Damn baby your a star
Mish momkin (amazing in arabic)
Can't help about the shape I'm in
I can't sing, I ain't pretty and my legs are thin
But don't ask me what I think of you
I might not give the answer that you want me to

Oh well

Now when I talk to God
I know he understands
He said "stick by me and I'll be your guiding hand"
But don't ask me what I think of you
I might not give the answer that you want me to

Oh well
Behind door one:
There's three things: greed, fortune and fame
Door two:
You might be happy but nobody know your name
Door three:
The bacon got you squatting naked by the razor fence
Door four:
You on the bench and got the drugs inside your favourite Tims

Cause on the road to riches, there ain't no time for getting sidetracked
Pump in the trunk if you frontin' punkin' you lie flat -
Down on the pavement
Diamond laser engraved it
Wasting all of my time and then wondering where my days went
I'm 26 but still I'm feeling like a senior
I'm only two years removed from leaning in the beamer now
Some friends ain't friends no more, I guess they jealous
Problems with baby mama constantly been like a relish to my
Neck fresh on the set live in the flesh
Rhymin the best
Yo bronsolini fans see hymen and breast
Talking sushi grade
My flow is linen and the shoes are suede
The wooden cutting board is right where the prosciutto laid
That's for the first course
The core burst off and hail
We'll be in hell but nobody trying to see the cell
Tonight we living life until we say goodnight
Breathe on the mic my flow knock the knees of a knight

My time always the right time
I'm surfing getting wavy
Like hawaiians on the pipeline, I'm never in my right mind
Zagat rated thirty foot decor
The food and service
Hey the blow is chopped up on the plate yo peace to Curtis
Never nervous cause I'm ready
Went from leaning in the German now we swerving in the Chevy
Artichokes cover spaghetti
Can't begin to fathom how I pair the words and form the sentences
Pierre Cardere described in bold print on the lenseses
One leaf, half of the dutch combat the cancer
Peace to Elton John cause in the jacket got the tiny dancer
Ready to tango
Extra clips inside the pouch just like the creature on the Kangol
Paint that precious shit like Van Gogh
Mango, that's for the lassi
I love when bitches sassy
Slutty nasty, and let me smash it in the taxi
Then I give her a german brunch
And now she turning stunts
Since 16 six times a day I'm burning blunts

I wanna live the life the twenty beamers gleaming shorty steaming rice
And then the fluff all burnt my penis shoot the semen twice in the face
Flyest of steaks, got my eyes on the papes
Rhyme butter lake you know my grading be prime on the steak
Aged to perfection, that's how I like the veno
We rolling ceelo
Throw like Marino
Cruise in the Regal
In overdrive like my libido
I'm stroking like I'm Michael Phelps into the pussy fetal
It's Bronsolino
Just like the dutch up
Leather loaf and mash the clutch up
We getting fucked up
I make the motherfucker beam a 

[?] up
Hellish capers and now I'm scoring more than Celtic Lakers
Kicking like Messi now we overlooking gorgeous acres
In my defence it's like the '85 Bears
There's no jail tales
Poetry emotion like I'm Gale Sayers
Before Maguire took his first needle
Yo we been looking fly and faucet fiends in corners in the bird fetal -
Positioning I know you hear me but not listening
We glistening I rock a jacket made for fishermen
The buccaneer for nutritional and a buck of deer
Create a hash vat and bake it off, cut a square
Tonne of flair like Rick I hold the pick
And plus I smoke a stick of heavy marijuana when I pose for flick
Get off the dick because we busting now
And when we come we eating crepes, you know we order up a dozen now
Yo, it's time for me to pump the volume
No problem, the record's revolvin'
Evil's the mixer, I'm the rap trixister
Paparazzi on the bum rush for pictures
Ice, coolin', yo colder than ever
Punk executioner E pull the lever
Rotate the wax tehn cut an'axe the tracks
Push up the levels till the red lights max
Don't try to size up, you better wise up
To the rap criminals, we're succeeded
Dope beats and lyrics, no beepers needed
For this drug deal, I'm the big wheel
The dope I'm sellin', you don't smoke, you feel
Out on the dance floor, on my world tour
I'm sellin' dope in each and every record store
I'm the king pin when the wax spins
Crack or smack will take you to a sure end
You don't need it, just throw that stuff away
You wanna get high? Let the record play

Mc Ice t
I'm your pusher
I know you're lovin' this drugs as it's comin' out your speaker
Bass thru the bottons, highs thru the tweeters
But this base you don't need a pipe
Just a tempo to keep your hype
Groovin' like I see you doin'
Some stupid crack would just ruin
Your natural high, why?.that ain't fly
And anyone who says it is, lies
Move like I knew you would, like I knew could
And if you ain't cracked out, then I know you should
Be able to give me a clap, to match exact with the track
And since I know that you ain't, I expect that
Oh now this jam is lit, it's like the ultimate
People high off dope but still physically fit
I'll make a million bucks, pack my dough in trucks
From sellin' dope beats, dope rhymes, dope cuts
I'll be the biggest dope dealer in history
Because all the fly will be high off that Ice-T

I'm your pusher

I'm bring it to boil, Evil E rock it up
You want it?.I don't think you got enough
Last suckers crossed, Syndicate shot'em up
Cops found'em in the lake bottom up
I don't play when it comes to my dope
I check my lyrics close, like with a microscope
I don't clean'em up with no ivory soap
I leave'em hard and pure, hope that you can cope
Because you might O.D. if you overdrive
This record, tape or CD, because the sound I've
Created on this wax is like a chemical
And the knowledge I give, makes me invincible
I'm your pusher

The cops don't know what to do, because my dope breaks thru
No matter what they do, my stuff gets to you
Kickin' on the Boulevard, my tempo's hyped and hard
I don't ask, the ICE just bogards
Sire Records puts me out, with Warner Bros. clout
My dope hits the streets with no doubt
Evil E adds the cut, then removes it
IZ checks for purity, then approves it
And then you get it, try it, and like it
And if it ain't potent, we remix and spike it
To bring you the pure dope, not a noose in a rope
Because if you're doin' crack, you're on death row
You're just a toy punk, to mess with that junk
You want some real dope, come look in my trunk
The dope I'm sellin' is life, 100% legit
So get real fool, and try some real hit

MC Ice t
I'm your pusher
I'm your pusher

[Verse 1]
I remember you in that jacked up jeep
Hair blowing sipping Mickey D's sweet tea
Cheap sunglasses and paisley boots
Long tan legs and those daisy dukes
Stopping for every single yard sale sign
What I wouldn't give to do that one more time

[Chorus]
Don't go city on me
Please girl keep it country
Life's so different since you cross those tracks
Bring that pretty little accent back
Don't go city on me
Come on keep it country
With your fancy bling and you're miss me jeans
The girl I knew wouldn't need those things
Don't go city on me, don't go city on me

[Verse 2]
Never knew what city lights looked like
From the bed of a truck on a summer night sky
Traffic jams on a gravel road
Don't you miss our old blue hole?
You climbed up on that rock and you held my hand
So I'm gonna say this once again

[Chorus]
Don't go city on me
Please girl keep it country
Life's so different since you crossed those tracks
Bring that pretty little accent back
Don't go city on me
Come on keep it country
With your fancy bling and you're miss me jeans
The girl I knew wouldn't need those things
Don't go city on, don't go city on me
Ohh

[Bridge]
You threw me that key, gave me one last kiss
Said girl it don't have to end like this

[Chorus]
Don't go city on me
Please girl keep it country
Life's so different since you crossed those tracks
Bring that pretty little accent back
Don't go city on me
Come on keep it country
With your fancy bling and you're miss me jeans
The girl I knew wouldn't need those things
Don't go
Baby
Don't go, no

[Outro]
Don't go city on me
Don't go, keep it country

I__come up hard, baby, but now I'm fine
I'm checkin' trouble, sure movin' down the line
Now here we go, y'all gotta play this
(Why?) 'Cause the others are so scared to say this
Now tell me, what am I supposed to do
About a sucker like you who ain't never paid dues?
Slapper, hip-happer, you're gettin' wacker
Your girl better step, or I just might jack her
Smack her like a gangster, but I don't bang
I gank suckers like you for thick gold chains
(He don't deserve it) Hell nah
So take it off your neck
'Cause Goddamn, you ain't comin' correct
What's this, a sucker duck holdin' a mic?
And like Keith Sweat said, somethin' just ain't right
Seems nowadays everybody wanna be a rapper
Down wit' crews
But they ain't never paid dues
Suckers perpetratin', playin' hardcore
Punks, I bet you worked at a flower store
You know what eats me up the most?
Is when a sucker just started and thinks he's high post
You ain't pay a nann due in your life
Talkin' 'bout a new style, you know who you sound like?
KRS, Chuck D, Kool Moe, as one
Yellin' on the mic like ya name was Run
You'se a peon, went and bought a pair of Lee's
Now all of a sudden you supposed to be an MC?
Yo, that's wack, it just ain't right
You only stood on one stage in your whole damn life
Now you want respect, hey yo, you'se a fool
Everybody wanna rap, but they ain't paid dues
I can still remember way, way back in the days
The times me and Aladdin dreamed of gettin' paid
Standin' outside just to pull in the jacks
To earn a little money to drop a dope track
Back in the days I drove a raggedy Dodge
Couldn't afford a studio, so we used a garage
Aladdin used to grab a gang of disco breaks
One turntable and a broken 808
My little brother Tunes and Frank, they hung around all night
To make sure that the demo was tight
Didn't have an enigneer, if you know what I mean
Aladdin did it all at the age of 16
Gifted, uplifted, straight gangsta Mack
Suckers had me playin' the back

But thanks to Ice-T I got my foot in the door
Now I'ma rock the mutha-(uh) till it ain't no more
We paid dues

I knew a brother who used to dress just like a faggot
Real tight jeans, some boots and leather jackets
Homie as hell, he never came outside
'Cause everytime I came around, he used to run and hide
Spoiled like a brat, had everything he wanted
And when he walked, he switched like a woman
Rode a pink bike, man, the sucker was soft
Had to be in before the street lights came on
Yo, just the other day I turned my radio on
The Mack Attack kicked on a brand new song
I didn't know what it was, I never heard it before
But the record was smooth and hardcore
I said to myself, "Hey yo, I gotta see this group."
So I called up Aladdin and the rest of the crew
Grabbed the nine wit' the hollow point tip
Stepped in the party with a gangster limp
Took a look at the stage, and yo, whaddya know?
The same old faggot from a long time ago
From real tight jeans and the go-go boots
He went to Pendeltons and a khaki suit
Now tell me, ain't this a blip?
Somebody need to slap the perpetrator in the lip
Yesterday he was a mamma's boy, now he's rappin?
Foolin' the crowd because he got you all clappin'
And tappin', an example of what I'm tryin' to prove
A sucker like this who ain't never paid dues
So to those who wanna rap, I'm pertainin' to you
Before you pick up a mic, you gotta pay dues, word
Let the story be told
That's the way it is
You got to pay yo' dues

Low Profile definitely in the buildin', ya dig?
W.C., DJ Aladdin
Frank, Crazy Tunes, Jazzy D
Abracadabra, DJ Aladdin
We outta here
Is it sinful if you're blue
To cheer up the place?
What is wrong with dressing up in satin and lace?
Get some earrings, some mascara, heels and a fan
Pretty soon you will start to feel a different man

What the hell's wrong with expressing yourself?
Being who you want to be?
Will anybody die if you put on a dress?
Who the hell cares if your blusher's a mess?

Start a new fashion, buck all the trends
Emphasise integrity

Cos what the hell is wrong with expressing yourself
For wanting to be me?

BILLY
What the hell's wrong with wearing a dress?
Being who you wanna be?
MICHAEL
Who the hell is it you try to impress
All you have to do is learn to care less
Start a new fashion, buck all the trends

MICHAEL
Billy, sing something to me

What the hell is wrong with expressing yourself?
For trying to be free

If you wanna be a dancer, dance
If you wanna be a miner, mine
If you want to dress like somebody else
Fine, fine, fine

It's not a big statement, it's not a weird act
Just a good idea at the time
We'll not complain about your boring life
If you'll just leave me to mine
If you wanna be a dancer, dance
If you wanna be a miner, mine

Everyone is different
It's the natural state
It's the facts, it's plain to see
The world's grey enough without making it worse
What we need is individuality

Young Weezy We and Eric B, aha
And I love all women (if you know what I mean)
Yes lord, I love them dark, I love them light
Short, tall, thick, thin and back one more again (alright)
But there's this one particular situation I need to tell you all about

I met a honey about a week ago
I got a little but I need some more
I ain't the only one to learn her curves
Matter of fact, forget what you heard
She's all, she's all that and more, oh yeah
Yes she is
Her reputation ain't squeaky clean
A little gossip ain't phasing me
So go ahead say what you want
You can give a damn, but I don't
Cause I'm gone, I'm already gone
Yes I am
Don't you know she's

She's my, redbone girl
A bitter sweet, but she's my world
Coffee cream, thick and lean
My redbone girl, redbone girl, yeah
Our baby hail from the Oakland Bay
Got an east coast vibe but a southern mind
A devil mind with an angel face
She'll leave and make a nonbeliever pray
For a chance, just to get some something
Yes she will
Uhh, you don't know what you do to me
But you're killing the girls in my history
I need a shot just to let her hit
She give me 2 when I need a fix
Lord knows I've tried, but I swear I can't quit
Don't you know she's my

She's my, redbone girl
Redbone but she's my world
Have you seen, my chocolate dream
My redbone girl, redbone girl
She's my, redbone girl
A bitter sweet, but she's my world
Coffee cream, thick and lean
My redbone girl, redbone girl, ooh

I like the long hair thick redbone
I do it so right, she say I'm dead wrong
And now she in love, like phase on
Now I'm in my zone, I got her head spinning, spinning like a cyclone
And it's them red women at my red eye zone
I'm high and my girl high yella
Fine as wine, put her in a wine cellar
Roses are red, do you mind if I smell them
What can you do, Consuela, Consuela
I like them light skin, lighter than a feather
And if she red hot, I'm biting that pepper
Tighter than my leather pants, let them say
She the same color as my flag – suwoo
She's my, redbone girl
Redbone, she's my world
Have you see, my milk chocolate dream
My redbone girl, redbone girl, yeah
She's my, redbone girl
A bitter sweet, but you know she's my world
Coffee cream, thick and lean
Redbone girl, my redbone girl, yeah

[Verse 1]
Can you hear it in the distance?
Can you... sense it far away?
Is it old Rudolph the Reindeer?
Is it Santa on his sleigh?
It's heading up to Easington
It's coming down the Tyne
Oh! It's bloody Maggie Thatcher
And Michael Heseltine!

[Chorus]
So Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher
May God's love be with you
We all sing together in one breath
Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher
We all celebrate today
Cos it's one day closer to your death

[Verse 2]
They've come to raid your stockings
And to steal your Christmas pud
But don't be too downhearted
It's all for your own good
The economic infrastructure
Must be swept away
To make way for business parks and lower rates of pay, so...

[Chorus]
Merry Christmas, Maggie Thatcher
May God's love be with you
We all sing together in one breath
Merry Christmas, Maggie Thatcher
We all celebrate today
Cos it's one day closer to your death

[Verse 3]
And they've brought their fascist bootboys
And they've brought the boys in blue
And the whole Trade Union Congress
Will be at the party too
And they'll all hold hands together
All standing in a line
Cos they're privatising Santa
This merry Christmas time, so...

[Chorus]
Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher
May God's love be with you
We all sing together in one breath
Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher
We all celebrate today
Cos it's one day closer to your death
Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher
May God's love be with you
We all sing together in one breath
Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher
We all celebrate today
Cos it's one day closer to your death

[Spoken MRS. WILKINSON]
Here's a piece of advice, Billy
Piss off out of here
Start everything a-fresh and don't look back
There is sod-all left for you here
You are very fucking special
Now piss off before I start to cry

[MINERS]
Once we built visions on the ground we hewed
We dreamt of justice and of men renewed
All people equal, in all things
We once were heroes
Once were kings
But all great things must come to pass
We know the first will soon be last
And in the ground we may be lain
But a seed is sown to rise again

So we walk proudly
And we walk strong
All together
We will go as one
The ground is empty
And cold as hell
But we all go together when we go

[Spoken TONY]
You show 'em kiddo
Knock them dead, will ya?

[Spoken BILLY]
Thanks, Tony

[Spoken TONY]
Alright
See ya, sunshine

[MINERS & TOWNSPEOPLE]
We saw a land where wealth was shared
Each pain relieved, each hunger fed
Each man revered, each tyrant killed
Each soul redeemed, each life fulfilled

From each man's means to each his need
We saw a time man would be freed
We fought for all the things we saw
The battle's lost but not the war

So we walk proudly
And we walk strong
All together
We will go as one
The ground is empty
And cold as hell
But we all go together when we go
We will go down but our heads are proud
We will go down with our voices loud
We will go down but come again
And we all go together when we go
Ah... (3 times)
And we all go together when we go
We walk proudly, and we walk strong
All together we will go as one
The ground is empty, and cold as hell
But we all go together when we go

We walk proudly, and we walk strong
All together we will go as one
The ground is empty, and cold as hell
But we all go together when we go

We walk proudly, and we walk strong
All together we will go as one
The ground is empty, and cold as hell
But we all go together when we go

Cold nites and harder days
Better lie down and lay away
Have a heart facing foreign places
Tired of seeing love, tired of waiting

Ooh, But I keep on doing it
I ain't gonna stop until we're through with this
Ooh, But I keep on doing it
I ain't gonna stop until we're through with this

Hey, yeah, ohh
Hope you know I miss you
Know that I want to kiss you
You said that I was the bestest bitch that ever stuck with you
After all the shit we've been through
How come you cannot see through?
We're stuck on automatic
Never there when I really need you

This shit for real, this shit is danger
You come around my house
And you act like a motherfucking total stranger
Anytime that I see you, baby
Anytime that I see you, lately
Hoping I'm safe for a while
Safe for a while

Ooh, but I keep on doing it
I ain't gonna stop until we’re through with this
Ooh, but I keep on doing it
I ain't gonna stop until we’re through with this

Now what would I change to get you back to my arms again?
Instead that my life made you in love with a different man
If in my time you would pass my life
Could I still take you as my love
Tell me what I wanna do, tell what I gotta do better

Hey, yeah, ohh
Hey
Ooh, but I keep on doing it
I ain't gonna stop until we’re through with this
Ooh, but I keep on doing it
I ain't gonna stop until we’re through with this
Ooh, but I keep on doing it
I ain't gonna stop until we’re through with this
Ooh, but I keep on doing it
I ain't gonna stop until we’re through with this
I can't see from how hard I'll be in where I'll stay
I pray for myself again

[Verse 1]
Will you meet there me at the old skies?
You'll know where to go
We've been there before
And I know it's real, so glad you came
We'll carry on
To where we belong

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that it's real
Yes I know that it's real

[Chorus]
I ain't dreamin'
I ain't dreamin'

[Verse 2]
Will you meet there when the time is right?
You'll know where to go
Just follow the light
And the light that shines after the rain
And rain means blessings
So blessed souls

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that it's real
Yes I know that it's real

[Chorus]
I ain't dreamin'
I ain't dreamin'
I ain't dreamin'
I ain't dreamin'
That's how it starts
We go back to your house
You check the charts
And start to figure it out

And if it's crowded, all the better
Because we know we're gonna be up late
But if you're worried about the weather
Then you picked the wrong place to stay
That's how it starts

And so it starts
You switch the engine on
We set controls for the heart of the sun
One of the ways we show our age

And if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up
If the sun comes up and I still don't wanna stagger home
Then it's the memory of our betters
That are keeping us on our feet
You spent the first five years trying to get with the plan
And the next five years trying to be with your friends again
You're talking forty-five turns just as fast as you can
Yeah, I know it gets tired, but it's better when we pretend

It comes apart
The way it does in bad films
Except in parts
When the moral kicks in

Though we're running out of the drugs
And the conversation's grinding away
I wouldn't trade one stupid decision
For another five years of life

You drop the first ten years just as fast as you can
And the next ten people who are trying to be believed
When you're blowing eighty-five days in the middle of this
Yeah, I know it gets tired only wearing on friends tonight

To tell the truth
Oh, this could be the last time
So when we go
Like a sail's force into the night

And if I made a fool, if I made a fool
If I made a fool on the road, there's always this
And if I'm sewn into submission
I can still come home to this
And with a face like a dad and a laughable stand
You leave conceit on the plane or review what you said
When you're drunk and the kids look impossibly tired
You think over and over, hey, I finally did

Oh, if the trip and the plan come apart in your hand
You look concerted on yourself your ridiculous prop
You forgot what you meant when you read what you said
And you always knew you were tired, but then

Where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?

If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends tonight

I am a mountain
I am a tall tree, oh

Sweepin' the country
I am a river
Down in the valley, oh

And I can see clearly

If anybody ask you who I am
Just stand up tall
Look 'em in the face and say

I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey, I made it
I'm the world's greatest
And I'm that little bit of hope
When my backs against the ropes
I can feel it
I'm the world's greatest
I am a giant
I am an eagle, oh
I am a lion
Down in the jungle
I am a marchin' band
I am the people, oh
I am a helpin' hand
I am a hero, oh

If anybody asks you who I am
Just stand up tall
Look 'em in the face and say

In the ring of life, I'll rein love
And the world will notice a king
When there is darkness I'll shine a light
And you'll use the success you'll find in me
I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey, I made it
I'm the world's greatest
I'm that little bit of hope
When my backs against the ropes

I saw the light
At the end of a tunnel
Believe in the pot of gold
At the end of the rainbow
And faith was right there
To pull me through, yeah
Used to be locked doors
Now I can just walk on through

It's the greatest
Can you feel it?
Say the greatest
Can you feel it?

I'm that star up in the sky

Hey, I made it

We float before the sea at dusk
In heavy mist, in glitter dust
I smile before I want to
I smile because you won't do

We sip the wind through lips of lust
And out it comes, warm wisps of love
I smile because I want to
I smile because you want to

Put the flowers in your hair
Wrap your tendrils round my chest
I smile because I want to
I am your boy

Shake my little soul for you now, toy
And I settle up into a world of noise
I'm a man of many tricks and tools and joy
With a battery of guilt on which to poise

Down by the shore, a funny foal
Who bit my wings and ate them whole
You left before I come to
You left before I come to
We took to heels into the trees
I hit my head and bit the leaves
You left before I come to
You left before I

Shake my little soul for you now, toy
And I settle up into a world of noise
I'm a man of many tricks and tools and joy
With a battery of guilt on which to poise

Shanks of slate fall to the beach
Wrapped up in life in ultra greens
Pools teem with tiny feet
And whorls of tidal memories

You left before I got to
You left before I got to
You left before I got to
You left before I

Shook the flowers from your hair
Run to me and kiss my hand
I'm dead before I
I'm dead before I

Shake my little soul for you then, toy
And I settle up into a world of noise
I'm a man of many tricks and tools and joy
With a battery of guilt on which to poise
Shake my little soul for you now, toy
And I settle up into a world of noise
I'm a man of many tricks and tools and toys
With a battery of guilt on which to poise

I smile because I want to, I smile because I want to
I smile because I want to, I smile because I want to
I smile because I want to, I smile because I want to
I smile because I want to, I smile because I want to
Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning she don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die these words will be written on my stone
And I'll be gone gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I been holdin' on too tight
With nothing in between
The story of my life I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time...
Is frozen (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change
Leave my heart open but it stays right here in its cage
And I'll be gone gone tonight
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright
The way that I been holdin' on so tight
With nothing in between
The story of my life I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time...
Is frozen (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
And I been waiting for this time to come around
But baby running after you is like chasing the clouds
The story of my life I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time...
Is frozen
The story of my life I give her hope (give her hope)
I spend her love until she's broke inside (until she's broke inside)
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life
The story of my life (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life

We back
I am digital MIMS
I'm the king of the web
I ain't no R&B singer but still I put you to bed
Show you how that super charge ride
Call that a hard drive
You get it?
A hard drive
And I'm passing them by like false side
I'm worldwide
Ya'll just want me to feel
Why?
100 foot docs
The world is mine
Coming soon (soon)
Til that time I bring you

[Spoken BILLY]
Grandma, do you really not remember about granddad?

[Spoken GRANDMA]
'Course I do!
How could I forget your granddad, Billy
We were married thirty-three year

[Spoken BILLY]
So what was like like

[Spoken GRANDMA]
He was a complete . . . Bastard!

[GRANDMA]
I hated the sod - for thirty-three year
We should never have married of that I'm quite clear
He spent the housekeeping money on whiskey and beer
And never lifted a finger
Times were hard, but the swine rolled back pissed
So we'd fight and he'd swing and he rarely missed
So I'd clobber the sod when he couldn't resist:
Asleep, you can't lift a finger
But we'd go dancing
And he'd hold me tight
He was air, He was water, He was breath, He was light
And he would hold me there, with all his might
And it was bliss for an hour or so
But then they called time to go
And in the morning we were sober

O he'd drink and he'd talk just like a fool
Lie like a bairn and snore like a mule
Rarely was sober, pretty much was the rule
And he never lifted a finger
I suppose times were hard, things were different then
Women were women and men, they were men
Seventeen, that was it, your life ended when you had a ring around your finger

But we'd go dancing, he was me own Brando
And for a moment there my heart was a-glow
We had dust in our hair and nowhere to go
Boo we were free for an hour or three
From the people we had to be
But in the morning we were sober

But if I went through my time again
Oh I'd do it without the help of men
Or at least your Grandad
But then again, you know
Best not to linger
What is the use of dreaming now?
I had my chance, well anyhow
If I'd only known then what I know now
I'd've given them all the finger

And gone dancing, and not give a shit
And spin around and reel and love each bit
And I'd dance alone and enjoy it
And I'd be me for an entire life
Instead of somebody's wife
And I never would be sober
And I never would be sober
La di da da da
La la la la la, la la la, la la

Ooh
(My life, my life, my life, my life in the sunshine)

[Chorus:]
If you looked in my life, you'd see what I see
If you looked in my life, you'd see what I see
If you looked in my life, you'd see what I see
If you looked in my life, you'd see what I see
(My life, my life, my life, my life in the sunshine)

[Verse 1:]
Life can be only what you make it
When you're feelin' down, you should never fake it
Say what's on your mind and you'll find in time
That all the negative energy
It will all decease
And you'll be at peace with yourself
You won't really need no one else
Except for the man up above
Because he'll give you love
(My life, my life, my life, my life in the sunshine)
If you looked into my life...

[Chorus:]
If you looked in my life, you'd see what I see
(Oh you will see I'm so blue)
If you looked in my life, you'd see what I see
(Down and out, crying everyday, don't know what to do or to say)
If you looked in my life, you'd see what I see
(If you looked into my life)
If you looked in my life, you'd see what I see
(My life, my life, my life, my life)

[Verse 2:]
Take your time
Baby, don't you rush a thing
Don't you know, I know we all are struggling
I know it is hard but we will get far
And if you don't believe in me
Just believe in He
'Cause he'll give you peace of mind (yes he would)
And you will see the sunshine (for real, yes you would)
And you'll get to free your mind
And things will turn out fine
Oh, I know that things will turn out fine
Yes they would, yes they would
(My life, my life, my life, my life)

[Break:]
Ohh, I gotta go through the fire, embrace the flame
Let it burn real deep, can't skip over the pain
I gotta break through
Hey, yeah, I gotta break through
I'm recognizing the man in the mirror was me
That was hurting myself in reality
I had to break through
Oh, I had to break through
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
I'm talkin' bout gettin' it together
I'm talkin' about dealing with the pressure
I'm talkin' about letting it burn
Let it burn, let it burn, let it burn, let it burn now
(My life, my life, my life, my life in the sunshine)

[Chorus:]
If you looked in my life, you'd see what I see
(If you looked into my la la la la)
If you looked in my life, you'd see what I see
(La la la la la la la la la)
If you looked in my life, you'd see what I see
(I had to let it burn y'all, let it burn, y'all, let it burn, let it burn, let it burn, let it...)
If you looked in my life, you'd see what I see
(Let it burn, let it burn)
(My life, my life, my life, my life)

My life is just like your life
All the time

[Verse 1]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So you never know, never never know
Never know enough, 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, system overload
Screaming, "No, no, no, n-nooo!"
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

[Hook]
So keep your love lock-down, your love lock-down
Keeping your love lock-down, your love lock-down
Now keep your love lock-down, your love lock-down
Now keep your love lock-down, you lose

[Verse 2]
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got something to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you 'fore it finally got through?
You lose, you lose
I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life
We're just wasting time, where's the finish line?

[Hook]
So keep your love lock-down, your love lock-down
Keeping your love lock-down, your love lock-down
Now keep your love lock-down, your love lock-down
Now keep your love lock-down, you lose

[Outro]
So keep your love lock-down, your love lock-down
Keeping your love lock-down, your love lock-down
Now keep your love lock-down, your love lock-down
Now keep your love lock-down, you lose
You lose
You lose
You lose

Honey, honey
I can see the stars all the way from here
Can't you see the glow on the window pane?
I can feel the sun whenever you're near
Every time you touch me, I just melt away

[Pre-Chorus]
Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear
But I know

After fighting through my tears
And finally, you put me first

Baby, it's you, you're the one I love
You're the one I need, you're the only one I see

As I kiss you again, and again, and again, and again

But I know

After fighting through my tears

What we gon' do now?
Oh lord, try some if you like it
Is slow it down on the flo'?
You know you like that
Try some if you like that
We keep this, who keep that?
Come on

When you look from outside
All you see is videos and shows
But there's more to my life
Than people could ever know

Sometimes I gotta smile, when I don't feel like smiling
Sit back and ride, when I feel like driving
Nobody understands but you girl
I can always be myself with you girl, that's why I'm singing

Ooh I can't believe it
You came just in time with what I needed
And you're not like the other girls I meet everyday
You stay down like them girls from around the way
Uh oh, that's why I had to say
Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me
That's why I had to say
Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me
Uh oh, that's why I had to say
Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me now
Right now

Since you been in my life
When I'm away from you I hurry home, oh yea
You live in my mind
So I never feel like I'm alone, yeah

Sometimes I gotta go, where I don't feel like going
And when it gets too fast, and I feel like slowing down
No one understands but you
That's why I only see myself with you

Ooh I can't believe it
You came just in time with what I needed
And you're not like the other girls, I meet everyday
You stay down like them girls from around the way

Ooh I can't believe it
You came just in time with what I needed
And you're not like the other girls, I meet everyday
You stay down like them girls from around the way
Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me
Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me
Come follow me, come follow me, come follow me now
Right now

You've been there for me and I'll
I'll be there for you girl

Ooh I can't believe it
You came just in time with what I needed
And you're not like the other girls, I meet everyday
You stay down like them girls from around the way

Ooh I can't believe it
You came just in time with what I needed
And you're not like the other girls, I meet everyday
You stay down like them girls from around the way

Ooh I can't believe it
You came just in time with what I needed
And you're not like the other girls, I meet everyday
You stay down like them girls from around the way
Making love to a picture frame
One more time tonight
You can tell by the lines in her smile
Something is not right
Where are you hiding?
She's on the outside
I'm on the inside crying
Just another crazy boy hungry for your
Hot love, wrap yourself around me like a warm glove
The emptiness leaves me
And I feel the never need to go back
To the way I was, the way I was
I've tried and tried and tried and tried
But I've no concept of consequence
And I'm a master of self defense
Days get longer, life gets shorter
She rips me like no other
So oh, dripping from head to toe
Where are you hiding?
She's on the outside
I'm on the inside crying
Hot love, wrap yourself around me like a warm glove
The emptiness leaves me
And I feel the never need to go back
To the way I was, the way I was
Hot love, wrap yourself around me like a warm glove
The emptiness leaves me
And I feel the never need to go back
To the way I was, the way I was
And I can't make the same mistake
If you lose my love, it was yours to take
Break down your door, take a little more
When I need you around
And I'm so terrified of leaving, it's a new low
Try and pick me up again but let go
See how far I get without you
Desperately need more of your
Hot love, wrap yourself around me like a warm glove
The emptiness leaves me
And I feel the never need to go back
To the way I was, the way I was
Hot love, wrap yourself around me like a warm glove
The emptiness leaves me
And I feel the never need to go back
To the way I was, the way I was
Voice of late night radio presenter begins...

Welcome back
You're rocking straight through midnight with me
Dojo Daniel
On 96.7
The Pipe
Up next
We got a triple shot of Mac DeMarco
Coming at ya Stuffing it down the chute
Once again
You're listing to 96.7
The Pipe
Even if you were a million miles away
I could still feel you in my bed
Near me, touch me, feel me
And even at the bottom of the sea
I could still hear inside my head
Tellin' me, touch me, feel me

And all the time you were tellin' me lies

So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

Have you ever tried sleeping with a broken heart?
Well, you could try sleeping in my bed

Lonely, own me nobody ever shut it down like you
You wore the crown
You made my body feel heaven bound
Why don't you hold me
Near me, I thought you told me
You'd never leave me
Looking in the sky I could see your face
And I know right where I fit in
Take me, make me, you know that I'll always be in love
With you
Right til the end OOh

So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you

Anybody could've told you right from the start
It's about to fall apart
So rather than hold on to a broken dream
Or just hold on to love

And I could find a way to make it
Don't hold on too tight
I'll make it without you tonight

So tonight, I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Tonight I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
I'm gonna hold on to the times that we had tonight
I'm gonna find a way to make it without you
Can't be sleeping
Keep on waking
Without the woman next to me
Guilt is burning
Inside I'm hurting
This ain't a feeling I can keep

So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me

Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on
Don't blame it on
I got to say
I'm so sorry
Oh I promise

Blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
So blame it on the night
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me
Don't blame it on me

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I did a show in Macon, said that I couldn't go in there
Pulled up with ten Memphis killas with pistols everywhere
Probation violation shit, must had to stay in there
But if they knew about my life I'd get the electric chair
Uhhhhhhhhhh
A Gucci party 10,000 for our section in there
(Shhh) Watcha call them for they just might run in there
You know I'm running dope dont 

[?] money squares
You know I fuck with real niggas, dont fuck with randoms or squares
I can buy and pay, I got pale guaps
And I buy the drop, and coming out hip hop
I'm a trap-rapper and I'm bringing it back
Gucci Mane, I kidnap rappers
Trap God, Trap Lord, Trap Boy, I trap hard
20 chains they all rock, a thousand pounds my old watch

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
They say Guwop back
He snatched a pack and he finna get his money back
Dont tell em that, dont tell em that
They say my trap house roll so hard
I might not even need my door attached
Don't tell em that, don't tell em that
Dont bring your bitch, she double bag
She seen me when I served a pack
Don't tell em that, don't tell em that
Remember way back in the trap
When I would buy like every strap
Don't tell em that, don't tell em that

[Verse 2: Peewee Longway]
Jonesboro South, no strap no trap
I'm strapped, seven bales in the back of the apartment
Don't tell em that they wise
I snatch your ass call up 

[?]
I'm too piped up the bitch had to go back
I'm the richest young nigga in the project
Longway riding in the foreign object
Goons riding behind me with chopsticks
Perfect timing 

[?]
I'm a goblin, I rob you
I want that pack I come for it, top shottas smack 

[?]
But its peewee Shawty lo and Guwop
Double right back for the guap
In the rari 448 drop top its extortion, its our block
MPA 1017 double down FN extendo
So don't tell me you bout that gangster shit
Or my nigga let a nigga clip go
Have a bag where your shit go

[?], shoot you in your big toe
Double cup where my peach crush go
This ain't mines 

[?] boy I let it go

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
They say Guwop back, he snatched a pack and he finna get his money back
Dont tell em that, dont tell em that
They say my trap house roll so hard
I might not even need my door attached
Don't tell em that, don't tell em that
Dont bring your bitch, she double bag
She seen me when I served a pack
Don't tell em that, don't tell em that
Remember way back in the trap
When I would buy like every strap
Don't tell em that, don't tell em that

[Verse 3: Shawty Lo]
Yaaay, big shooter out to do the club
I'm in this bitch shooting and booty money
I love to see em way they pick it up
She say Im sick the way I throw it up
Dirty birds, show them how they fly
No brown, only Roddy White
And he say I'm fucking with Shawty Lo
You know I'm probably just gon fuck this hoe
Short hoe I call it Mighty Mouse
I give her cheese she give me mighty mouth
Pay money tell them show back
(Pay a key runner?) tell em that

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
They say Guwop back, he snatched a pack and he finna get his money back
Dont tell em that, dont tell em that
They say my trap house roll so hard
I might not even need my door attached
Don't tell em that, don't tell em that
Dont bring your bitch, she double bag
She seen me when I served a pack
Don't tell em that, don't tell em that
Remember way back in the trap
When I would buy like every strap
Don't tell em that, don't tell em that

[Verse 1]
I'm wandering
Been moving to and fro, just wandering
With no place to go

[Chorus]
Since I lost you, lost you
All I ever do is be wandering
'Til I wander back to you

[Verse 2]
Oh, oh, I'm wishing, been yearning for your kiss
Ooh, now I've been missing, the warmth of your caress

[Chorus]
Since I lost you, I've lost you, all I ever do is be wandering
Wandering, wandering, wandering
I'll be wandering 'til I wander back to you

[Bridge]
I look on every corner, down every dismal street
Are you there? Are you there?
Oh darling I repeat
I visit old familiar places
There's no one there but me
Where can you be? Where can you be?
Oh darling, where can you be?

[Verse 3]
Oh, I'm praying your touch for me has grown
Mmm, and I'm saying, for before it's not been known

[Outro]
I love you, I love you, and all I ever do is be wandering
Crying, wandering, wandering
I'll be wandering 'til I wander, 'til I wander back to you
Yeah, oh yeah
I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be wandering 'til I wander back to you
Yeah, yeah, mmm, wandering back to you

[Verse 1]
Slow down, come close and listen
Its been a long time since we've
Gotten together like this
And I really miss you
I told you could talk to me
But it's easier for you, I see
For you to rush, and get in a hurry
To be anxious and to worry
Instead of coming to me and remaining in my safety
You'd rather do all yourself
But you know you need my help

[Chorus]
Be still and know
Just be still and know
I will never leave you side
I will never make you cry
You've got to know I already know
The plans I have to make you thrive
Give you hope and Peace of mind
You must be still

[Verse 2]
Your best in the my hands
Your success is in my plan
With tenderness I speak to you
In restfulness I keep you
I wash your fears away so doubt can never stay
When I stand strong in you
I give you power to renew but
You never take the time out
Sit in silence and to find out
I've always been right here
Waiting on you to come near me

[Chorus]
Be still and know
Just be still and know
I will never leave you side
I will never make you cry
You've got to know I already know
The plans I have to make you thrive
Give you hope and Peace of mind
You must be still

[Bridge]
So hold, hold on to my hand
And rest in my arms and hear
Hear the still small voice saying you can make it
I've never let you down

[Chorus]
Be still and know
Just be still and know
I will never leave you side
I will never make you cry
You've got to know I already know
The plans I have to make you thrive
Give you hope and Peace of mind
You must be still
Rebel, rebel and yell
'Cause our people still dwell in hell
Locked in a cell
Yes, the structure's a cell
Mad is the story I tell
How long can we wait?
Come on, seein' what's at stake
Action for reaction
If your mind's in a somewhat complacent state
Get a check up
This is a stick up
Our freedom or your life
Lord, I wish I could be peacful
But there can be no sequel
Now freedom must be fundamental
In Johannesburg or South Central
On the mic, 'cause someone should tell 'em
To kick in the township rebellion

Come on, ugh
Yeah, what about that sucka
Yeah, so you thought you could get with the hard rhymes
That fill your mind
Thoughts, battles fought
And lessons taught
Yes I'll display the fitness
And flip like a gymnast
Cause rhyme after rhyme
And droppin' line after line
Your locked in a test of the mind
Your style is lagging behind, stuck in 89
Yes I'm inclined, I'm wearing a blind
Come to get some in 91
No freedom in the land of the free
If ya see it then tell me
Now freedom must be fundamental
In Johannesburg or South Central
On the mic, 'cause someone should tell 'em
To kick in the township rebellion

Why stand on a silent platform
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform
Fight the war, fuck the norm

Ugh
Come on

When ignorance reigns, life is lost
When ignorance reigns, life is lost
Come on
When ignorance reigns, life is lost

Why stand on a silent platform
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform
Fight the war, fuck the norm
Why stand on a silent platform
Fight the war, fuck the norm

[Verse 1]
Home, home in the late night
And away, away in the half light
Except Saturday, crushed by the boring
Until played and plagued again by the tourists
When once you had believed it
Now you see it's sucking you in
To string you along with the pretense
And pave the way for the coming release

[Verse 2]
Alone and prone in the half light
And late, late to the real life
If you find a way into the gold rush

Oi, Dancing Boy!

[Spoken Billy]
See ya, Michael

[Spoken Michael]
Yeah
See ya, Billy
I love you..
Baby I love you
You are my life
My happiest moments weren't complete
If you weren't by my side
You're my relation
In connection to the sun
With you next to me
There's no darkness I can't overcome
You are my raindrops
I am the seed
With you and God, who's my sunlight
I bloom and grow so beautifully
Baby, I'm so proud
So proud to be your girl
You make the confusion
Go all away
From this cold and messed up world

I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing
Called life without you here with me
Cause I'm Dangerously In Love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me
The way I love you loving me
Every time I see your face
My heart smiles
Every time it feels so good
It hurts sometimes
Created in this world
To love and to hold
To feel
To breathe
To live you

I am in love with you
You set me free
I can't do this thing
Called life without you here with me
Cause I'm Dangerously In Love with you
I'll never leave
Just keep lovin' me
The way I love you loving me

I love you, I love you, I love you
Dangerously in love
I love you, I love you, I love you

He loves me especially different
Everytime you keep me on my feet happily
Excited by your cologne, and your hands
Your smile, your intelligence
You woo me, you court me, you tease me, you please me
You school me, give me things to think about
Ignite me, you excite me
You love me and you like me
Incite me, Incite me to chorus
Larararilarara...
La la la la
Uh uh uh uh uh..
Dangerously In Love

[Verse 1: Chester Watson]
So I’ve been gazing at the stars for a minute
I never could connect the constellations
But I really liked the way they all kinda shimmer
City light, pollution’s said to be the fall, now I'm waiting
In black coals, strips base walls and
The Matrix leaves me an enigma, food for thought, I’m the top chef
I did the box, lost profit
Speak to the cosmos before thoughts process

[Pre-Chorus]
Right my little pooh bear, wanna take a chance?
Wanna sip the smooth air, kick it in the sand?
I’ll say I told you so but you just gonna cry
You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes

[Post-Chorus]
Pray, pray, I can’t, I can’t pray
Pray, pray, peanut butter, I can't pray

[Verse 2: Chester Watson]
(Preach)
Meaning’s my end language, state
Super beings sign treaties of the lands and space
See the sharks in the distance, watch me swim in their direction
Archbishop of the new world, curled in the mess
Found pearls in the wreckage, pawned 'em
Spawned a thousand ships to arm the armada
Garments, hard posture, slate
Onyx and jade weapons in cold breast plate
Blessed with the crest made of thin gold

[Pre-Chorus]
Alright, come close
Let me show you everything I know
A jungle slang
Spinning round my head and I stare

[Chorus]
My my simple sir, this ain't gonna work
Mind my wicked words and tipsy topsy slurs
I can’t take this place, no I can’t take this place
I just wanna go where I can get some space

[Post-Chorus]
Pray, pray, I can’t, I can’t pray
Pray, pray, peanut butter, I can't pray

[Chorus]
My my simple sir, this ain't gonna work
Mind my wicked words and tipsy topsy slurs
I can’t take this place, no I can’t take this place
I just wanna go where I can get some space

[Verse 1]
Wait for the day you come home from the lonely part
And look for the girl who has put up with all of your shit
You never have needed anything for so long

[Verse 2]
You learn in your bed
That you've been gone for too long
So you put in the time
But it's too late to make it strong

[Chorus]
Now all I want is your pity
Or all I want are your bitter tears
Yeah and all I want is your pity
Or at least all I want are your bitter tears

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
And all I want is your pity
Or all I want are your bitter tears
Or all I want is your pity
Or at least all I want are your bitter tears

[Verse 3]
Wake with a start
And the dog and the girl are gone
So you pack up your things
And head into the lame unknown
You never have needed anyone for so long

[Chorus]
Now all I want is your pity
Or all I want are your bitter tears
Yeah and all I want is your pity
Or at least all I want are your bitter tears

[Outro]
From now on, I'm so different
'Cause it's no fun to be predictably lame
From now on, let's do it different
'Cause I just want what I want
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home

[Chorus: The Grateful Dead]
Get in the groove and let the good times roll
We're gonna stay here until we soothe our soul
If it takes all night long
Come on and let the good times roll
We're gonna stay here 'til we soothe our soul
If it takes all night long

[Verse 1: Brent Mydland]
The evening sun is sinking low
The clock on the wall says it's time to go
But I got my plans and I got plans for you
I'll tell you exactly what we're all gonna do

[Chorus: The Grateful Dead]
Get in the groove and let the good times roll
We're gonna stay here 'til we soothe our soul
If it takes all night long
Come on and let the good times roll
We're gonna stay here 'til we soothe our soul
If it takes all night long

[Verse 2: Bob Weir]
Listen, it might be twelve o'clock and it might be three
Time doesn't mean that much to me
Ain't felt this way since I don't know when (note 4)
Might not Don't when I'm gonna feel this way again

[Chorus: The Grateful Dead]
Get in the groove and let the good times roll
We're gonna stay here 'til we soothe our soul
If it takes all night long
Come on and let the good times roll
We're gonna stay here 'til we soothe our soul
If it takes all night long

[Verse 3: Jerry Garcia]
It might be six o'clock and it might be eight (note 5)
It don't matter that it's getting late
We're gonna make the band play one more song
Get in the groove if it takes all night long

[Chorus: The Grateful Dead]
Get in the groove and let the good times roll
We're gonna stay here 'til we soothe our soul
If it takes all night long
Come on and let the good times roll
We're gonna stay here 'til we soothe our soul
If it takes all night long

[Bridge: The Grateful Dead]
All night (All night)

If it takes all night long (all night)

Fatman Scoop

You and me
After leaving my apartment
I feel this cold inside me
It howls away all through the market
It calls your name

Oooh oooh
Oooh oooh

On my way to your apartment
I write for fear of silence
You carved a boat to sail my shadow
Now I walk alone

Oooh alright, alright

I hit the sidewalk, and this is how it starts
Caught in a wrinkle when things are fallin' apart

After leaving your apartment
I hit the coast by nightfall
So sure to keep you dreamin'
You understood
Oooh, I know, you understood
Yes sir, it shows, I was no good
Ahh, ahh, ahh alright, alright

I hit the sidewalk, and this is how it starts
Caught in a wrinkle when things are fallin apart
'Cause sooner or later this is bound to stop
Come on lets save her but were falling hard

After leaving your apartment
I hear the cold
And now, I'm like
Well, well, well
What the fuck is this
A condom in my bed
Ya better start talkin', bitch
'Fore I take a match and
Burn this motherfucker down
I said you better start talkin'
And start talkin' right god damn now

Then she said baby
I'm so speechless
Then I said my baby
You gone be breathless
If ya don't start talkin' quick
Woman, I'm gone have a fit
You don't know what ya fuckin' wit
Girl ya better cut the bullshit

Now its obvious somebody has been all up in my home
In my bed, and plus I smell cigarettes
Now and sniffin and lookin around
Suspicious like someone's here
Then I looked in her eyes and in her eyes
There was so much fear
Pull out my gun said is he still here
She shook her head and said no
I'm checkin' behind every door
She cried out he left right after you called
I said what the fuck was you thinking
You thought that I wouldn't find this out

Then I said you must be crazy or on crack to have somebody off
Up in my motherfuckin' house
She hopped up and said that's enough
She said I can't take no more

And then she said you made your point
But now its time to even the score
She said I know all about last night
And where you went when you left the club

Said that's right, nigga I was there
Wit this guy in the back of the club
I said I thought you was wit yo girls

She said I thought you was wit yo guys
She said you was at that bitches house
And don't even try to act surprised
Said bab, she said shut up
Don't you say a word
It ain't nothin' you can say
That I ain't already heard

Then I said woman, don't you try to turn it all around
Cause the fact still remains that someone else was in my house
Then she said you're right about that
Somethin' did go down, but I don't have to turn it around

Cause what goes around comes back around
I'm movin' a little closer to her
She's trippin' over the furniture
She said wait first, just let me explain

I said no need to, just give me his name
And then she said uh, uh
I say uh what
She said please sit down in a chair
And I say no, I'm standin' up
And she cries out I'm so scared to tell you because of what ya might do
And I screamed look girl you better give me this man's name and I'm not playin' wit you

She says okay, wipes her nose and asks me about a girl named Tina
I thought to myself, said it sound familiar
I said I probably know her if I seen her
Then I say anyway girl
What the hell does that got to do with this man
She said he know my girl Roxanne
I said who the hell is Roxanne
Then she says Roxanne's a friend of mine who know with this guy named Chuck
Chuck's cool wit this guy name Rufus

And I'm sittin' here like what the fuck
Then she says Rufus wife, Cathy
We both went to high school
She introduced me to
The policeman that stopped you

[Verse 1]
Hot wax crawling under the door
Hot wax crawling under the floor
Hot wax creeping under the hill
Hot wax creeping under the sill

[Chorus]
Hot wax, come on get her
Now everybody's learning how
Come on a surfari with me
Hot wax, hot wax
Hot wax, hot wax

[Verse 2]
Hot wax creeping under the scene
Hot wax dripping under the fiend
Hot wax leaking under the sink
Hot wax leaking under the drain
Hot wax coming under the Lord
Hot wax coming under the door
Hot wax coming into the brain
Hot wax coming into the maze

[Chorus]
Hot wax, come on get her
Now everybody's learning how
Come on a surfari with me
Hot wax, hot wax
Hot wax, hot wax
Hot wax, come on get her
Now everybody's learning how
Come on a safari with me
Hot wax, hot wax
Hot wax, hot wax

[Verse 3]
Hot wax dripping under the scene
Hot wax dripping under the fiend
Hot wax leaking under the sink
Hot wax leaking under the drain
Hot wax rising from beneath
Hot wax rising from the leaves
Hot wax rising under my bed
Hot wax running up my legs

[Outro]
Hot wax, hot wax
Hot wax, hot wax
Hot wax, hot wax
Hot wax, hot wax
Hot wax, hot wax

To be smart and play a part in somethin beautiful
Embrace life appreciate the fact you even breathing
Cause we in the crosshairs and it's open season
If each one teaches one we got a good start
Your not a square cause you care and have a good heart
We gotta speak soft, And listen harder
It's right in front of our face but we don't even bother

(Uh) Think about it (Uh) Think about it
Be about, don't be afraid to speak about it
(Uh) Don't cry about it (Uh) even though they lie about it
Set a fire, inspire don't turn the other cheek about it

(Whoa) But we can start by saving a life (Whoa)
One at a time, One at a time
(Whoa) So let's make history (Whoa) and help out those in need (Whoa)
One at a time, One at a time
We can change a life
I be like my generations complaining about things that we don't have
But if you think about if you think about it we ain't got it so bad
Trust me I know bad, And I met worst
And it'd be so sad, To sit it and let it get worst
It's a simple concept we need to grasp quickly
Before we end up wishing we did something differently
So go and spread the word, And not the virus
C'mon let's get together try and put this all behind us

(Uh) Think about it (Uh) Think about it
Be about, don't be afraid to speak about it
(Uh) Don't cry about it (Uh) even though they lie about it
Set a fire, inspire don't turn the other cheek about it

(Whoa) But we can start by saving a life (Whoa)

His Latest Flame

[Verse 1]
Very old friend
Came by today
As he was telling everyone in town
Of all the love that he'd just found

[Chorus]
And Marie's the name of his latest flame

[Verse 2]
Talked and talked
And I heard him say
That she had the longest blackest hair
Prettiest green eyes anywhere

[Chorus]
And Marie's the name of his latest flame

Rusholme Ruffians

[Verse 1]
The last night of the fair
By the big wheel generator
A boy is stabbed
His money is grabbed
And the air hangs heavy like a dulling wine
She is famous, she is funny
An engagement ring doesn't mean a thing
To a mind consumed by brass and money, oh

[Chorus]
The last night of the fair
From a seat on a whirling waltzer
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye
It's a hideous trait on her mother's side
From a seat on a whirling waltzer
Her skirt ascends for a watching eye
A hideous trait on her mother's side

[Verse 3]
Then someone falls in love
Someone's beaten up
Someone's beaten up
And the senses being dulled are mine
And someone falls in love
Someone's beaten up
And the senses being dulled are mine

[Chorus]
This is the last night of the fair
And the grease in the hair
Of a speedway operator
Is all a tremulous heart requires
A schoolgirl is denied
She said: "How quickly would I die
If I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"

[Chorus]
This is the last night of the fair
And the grease in the hair
Of a speedway operator
Is all a tremulous heart requires
A schoolgirl is denied
She said: "How quickly would I die
Oh, if I jumped from the top of the parachutes?"

[Outro]
Oh, walk home alone
I might walk home alone
But my faith in love is still devout
I might walk home alone
But my faith in love is still devout
I might walk home alone
But my faith in love is still devout
When I see you on the street
My whole body gets weak
When you're standing in a crowd
Your love talks to me so loud
Girl, do I do, what you do, when I do my love to you

When I hear you on the phone
Your sweet, sexy voice turns my ear all the way on
Just the mention of your name
Seems to drive my head insane
Girl, do I do, what you do, when I do my love to you...baby

Sss..Mmm
Yes I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes I got some honey suckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you
Yes I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes I got some honey suckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you

My life has been waiting for your love
My arms have been waiting for your love to arrive
My heart has been waiting
My soul anticipating your love, love, love
From the time that I awake
I'm imagining the good love that we'll make
If to me your vibe can do all this
Just imagine how it's going to feel when we hug and kiss
Sugar, do I do, what you do, when I do my love to you...all right

Sss..Mmm
Yes I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes I got some honey suckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you
Yes I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes I got some honey suckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you

My life has been waiting for your love
My arms have been waiting for your love to arrive
My heart has been waiting
My soul anticipating your love, your love, your love

Ladies and gentlemen
I have the pleasure to present on my album
Mr. Dizzy Gillespie...Blow!
Blow, blow, blow, blow, blow, blow!
Do I do, what you do, when I do my love to you

Yes I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes I got some honey suckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you
Yes I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes I got some honey suckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you
My life has been waiting for your love
My arms have been waiting for your love to arrive
My heart has been waiting
My soul anticipating your love, your love, your lo-o-ove

Oh, I don't care how long it might take
'Cause I know the woman for me, you I'll make
And I will not deny myself the chance
Of being part of what feels like the right romance

Girl, do I do, what you do, when I do my love to you, oh yeah

Yes I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes I got some honey suckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you

Yes I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes I got some honey suckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you

Yes I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes I got some honey suckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you

[Intro]
Tell me it is just a rumor, baby
Ooh baby

[Verse 1]
Another day is passing by
And here I sit in sorrow (Sorrow)
Tears streamin' from my eyes
I'm afraid to face tomorrow ('Morrow)
The things I hear from my friends
Tryin' to make me see (See)
Your love is gone
You're movin' on
Soon be leaving me

[Chorus]
So, tell me it's just a rumor, baby
(Tell me it is just a rumor, love)
Ooh babe

[Verse 2]
They say you've found another love
You don't need me any longer (Longer)
It may be pride I feel inside
'Cause my love is growing stronger (Stronger)
I pay the cost of the love I lost
If I can't turn to you (You)
And here what seems to be the thing
That the people say is true

[Chorus]
Come on and tell me, just a rumor, baby
(Tell me it is just a rumor, baby)
Tell me (Tell me it is just a rumor, love)
Oh oh

[Bridge]
Listen to me, baby
I just need to conceal
The way I truly feel
I love you too much to hide it
There's no need to deny
I love you so (Even though)

[Verse 3]
I'm going insane from loving in vain
And you'll soon make a fool of me (Me)
But I can't accept a word I hear
Unless you say the same to me

[Chorus]
Come on and tell me, it's just a rumor, baby
(Tell me it is just a rumor, baby)
Come on and tell me, yeah (Tell me it is just a rumor, love)

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh
Tell me it is just a rumor, baby

From this position
I can relax
From this position
I can see the whole place

From this position
Oh, just relax
From this, from this position
I can, I can make my stand
For I can make my peace with the man

Until it's pow, pow pow pow pow, pow pow pow pow
Until it's pow, pow pow pow pow, pow pow pow pow

From this position
I have a good rip on both of them
From this position
I totally get how the decision was reached

From this position
I can say stuff like "ah, this is serious" or "it's a cop-out" or "hard to define"
From this position, from this -
Oh, uh, happy birthday, Nightingales radio station
With you on the inside
And me on the outside
There's advantages to both
(Advantages to both)

And with me being uptight
And you feeling alright
There's advantages to each
(Advantages, advantages)

From this position
I have a bold grasp on both of them
And this is, uh, solely because I have stayed home and um, eaten at Marlo's, and I have cable now

Until it's pow, pow pow pow pow, pow pow pow pow
Until it's pow, pow pow pow pow, pow pow pow pow

Until it's pow, pow pow pow pow, pow pow pow pow
Until it's pow, pow pow pow pow, pow pow pow pow

With you on the keystroke
And me in the gang plank
There's advantages to both
(Advantages to both)

With you being alright
And me being uptight
This is not being filmed, but
Oh, screw you, Michael Musto
And I am untied
And you are all cross-eyed
There's advantages to each
(Advantages to each)

But I am coming back, coming back, coming back
Coming back till there's nothing left in the well
Is that what they call it, the well?

Until I'm paralyzed and looking through you
But if nothing's right, we try anyway

As we compromised an arrogant person
Till I'm amazed at my decision to stay

On this occasion, there's a couple of important things that we learned from Fact Magazine
One, the king wears a king hat and lives in a king house
Two, your time will come, but tonight is our night, so you should give us your drugs
Three, uh, well three doesn't make sense anymore because it's to be played in the future

And now well times have been tough, and times have been tough
And you've been pushed down and washed up and rinsed out
But lets be honest with ourselves, let's be honest with each other, uh is that a- is that- what is- dededededede- did somebody get a text?

Until it's pow, pow pow pow pow, pow pow pow pow
Until it's pow, pow pow pow pow, pow pow pow pow
Until it's pow, pow pow pow pow, pow pow pow pow
Until it's pow, pow pow pow pow, pow pow pow pow

(The return of the police!)

With you on the inside
And me on the outside
There's advantages to both
(Advantages to both)

With me being wired
And you being tired
There's advantages to each
(Advantages, advantages)

From this position, I have developed an affinity for the both of them, which is confusing
Because, uh, we write these songs and it's like a paragraph of lyrics and there's no way to know when the rhythm comes 'cause there's no-
Oh, screw it

Reclining, I'm getting used to it
It's like kissing under a bridge
It's an entirely new discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery

And then a couple of weeks at home
And a couple of weeks away
And then home and away, again
To use up your desire for discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery, discovery

For an instant, you could have pushed through
But it's a plagiarized regret anyway
And now I want for now is someone to feel you
And that the thing you like is threatening to stay

And all this time
It's so nice
It's so nice
It's so nice

(It's the return of the police!)
Can you stay up for the weekend
And blame god for looking too old
Can you find all that you stand for
Has been replaced with mountains of gold
You cannot dream yourself to notice
To feel pain and swallow fear
But can you stay up for the weekend
For next year

God I can't do this anymore
Though I'll be laid down on the floor
As many feet walk through the door
I'm not alone

If i see a light flashing
Could this mean that I'm coming home
If i see a man waving
Does this mean that I'm not alone

If i see a light flashing
Could this mean that I'm coming home
If i see a man waving
Does this mean that I'm not alone
No?
If i see a light flashing
Could this mean that I'm coming home
If i see a man waving
Does this mean that I'm not alone

[Verse 1]
I see you in the dark
Corner of the street
Comin' after me, yeah
Headlights on full-beam
Comin' down the fast lane
Comin' after me

[Chorus]
You follow me around
You follow me around
You follow me around
You follow me around

[Verse 2]*
Blowin' holes in everythin'
Thatcher's children
See you on the way back down
Drooling looney tunes
Movin' in a swarm
Movin' in a swarm

[Chorus]
You follow me around
You follow me around
You follow me around
You follow me around

[Post-Chorus]
Na-da-da-da-da-da
Na-da-da-da-da-da, yeah
Na-da-da-da-da-da
Na-da-da-da-da-da, yeah

[Verse 3]
Nowadays I get panicked
I cease to exist
I have ceased to exist
I feel absolutely nothin'
The words are out of ink
The words you know are out of ink

[Chorus]
You follow me around
You follow me around
You follow me around
You follow me around

[Post-Chorus]
Na-da-da-da-da-da
Na-da-da-da-da-da, yeah
Na-da-da-da-da-da
Na-da-da-da-da-da, yeah

[Chorus]
It's some things I wanna do to your body, baby
We can do it tonight, it's on
A rude boy like me would drive you crazy
I'ma have you speaking in tongues
Shawty you gon' say "La, la-la, la-la, la, la, la"
I'ma have you speaking in tongues
Shawty you gon' say "La, la-la, la-la, la, la, la"
I'ma have you speaking in tongues

[Verse 1]
There's a lot on my mind
Most of what I'm thinkin' has to do with you
All I need is one night
I guarantee it turns into truth

[Pre-Chorus]
We can move fast or we can go slow
No it don't matter to me
I just need to give you that vocal
'Til you forget how to speak

[Chorus]
It's some things I wanna do to your body, baby
We can do it tonight, it's on
A rude boy like me would drive you crazy
I'ma have you speaking in tongues
Shawty you gon' say "La, la-la, la-la, la, la, la"
I'ma have you speaking in tongues
Shawty you gon' say "La, la-la, la-la, la, la, la"
I'ma have you speaking in tongues

[Verse 2]
Come inside, close the door
We don't have to say anymore
Let your body do the talking
And show me all the secrets it holds

[Pre-Chorus]
We can move fast or we can go slow
No it don't matter to me
I just need to give you that vocal
'Til you forget how to speak

[Chorus]
It's some things I wanna do to your body, baby
We can do it tonight, it's on
A rude boy like me would drive you crazy
I'ma have you speaking in tongues
Shawty you gon' say "La, la-la, la-la, la, la, la"
I'ma have you speaking in tongues
Shawty you gon' say "La, la-la, la-la, la, la, la"
I'ma have you speaking in tongues

[Bridge]
Wanna hear what you sound like
I wanna hear what you sound like
Girl I can handle this all night
I wanna hear what you sound like

[Chorus]
It's some things I wanna do to your body, baby
We can do it tonight, it's on
A rude boy like me would drive you crazy
I'ma have you speaking in tongues
Shawty you gon' say "La, la-la, la-la, la, la, la"
I'ma have you speaking in tongues
Shawty you gon' say "La, la-la, la-la, la, la, la"
I'ma have you speaking in tongues
"La, la-la, la-la, la, la, la"
I'ma have you speaking in tongues
Shawty you gon' say "La, la-la, la-la, la, la, la"
I'ma have you speaking in tongues

[Verse 1]
Baby, I'll admit, I made a mistake
Don't know what I was thinking, what I had was so great
Charged it to my mind but not to my heart
I know it ain't fair, sometimes I want it all
Go 'head and cuss me out, girl, I understand
I'ma stay right here and take it like a man
I really need you back, babe, what I gotta do?
Let me be honest and straight up tell the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
I haven't been the same since I left you
I can't enjoy myself, even if I tried to
I'm not happy, it ain't a laughing matter
And you don't understand

[Chorus]
My heart is hollow
I didn't know I'd end up like this
I said I didn't want it, now I miss you
My heart is hollow
And I don't care if the neighbors hear me loud
Baby, I'll scream it out
Don't know what I was thinking 'bout
Hollow
I thought I wanted to spread my wings
But I'm empty tryna do my things out in these streets
I wanna fly back, can I come back home?
Without your love, it's hollow

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Girl

[Verse 2]
I will never be the same no more
Promise I can do you better, sincerely yours
And them times I didn't even try
And even when I told them lies, you stayed wonderful, girl
Can I least just get the chance to show you I
That I'm not a little boy, I won't make you cry
And it means now, all we need is time
And we can get back to the way things were

[Pre-Chorus]
I haven't been the same since I left you
I can't enjoy myself, even if I tried to
I'm not happy (Happy), it ain't a laughing matter
And you don't understand

[Chorus]
My heart is hollow
I didn't know I'd end up like this
I said I didn't want it, now I miss you
My heart is hollow
And I don't care if the neighbors hear me loud
Baby, I'll scream it out
Don't know what I was thinking 'bout
Hollow
I thought I wanted to spread my wings
But I'm empty tryna do my things out in these streets
I wanna fly back, can I come back home?
Without your love, it's hollow

[Bridge]
Only so much I can take, this love is breaking down
Come rescue me, I need your arms gently wrapped around
Say you need me and don't let go, woah
And just to put it simply, girl, my heart is empty

[Chorus]
(Hallow) My heart is hollow
I didn't know I'd end up like this
I said I didn't want it, now I miss you
My heart is hollow
And I don't care if the neighbors hear me loud (I don't care)
Baby, I'll scream it out (Scream it out)
Don't know what I was thinking 'bout
Hollow
I thought I wanted to spread my wings (Yeah)
But I'm empty tryna do my things out in these streets (Oh, I'm so empty)
I wanna fly back, can I come back home?
Without your love, it's hollow

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Girl
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Girl

[Intro]
Check this out, girl
I know you sitting back saying to yourself
"I know he ain't tryna holla," nah
But it's something I gotta tell ya
Aw yeah, aw yeah, and it got to do with love
And I just want you to sit back and listen
While I sing this song to you
Check me, listen, huh

[Verse 1]
It's like the hardest thing for me to say
Without cracking a smile
It's something that we both really feel inside
But never talked about
They call it love, oh yes, they do
A dangerous thing when you're part of the games
So, girl, I feel you when you get emotional and don't wanna let me go
Ha, but it's something I gotta tell ya

[Chorus]
Don't mean to cut you off but the question is
So when you gon' be my girl? When you gon' be my girl?
I wanna know when it comes to loving why you change the subject
You should know, girl, you know that I'm the man you want, oh yes I am
Girl, what's really good with ya?
So when you gon' be my girl? When you gon' be my girl?
All this playing 'round is getting old now
So baby, tell me where I stand

[Verse 2]
I know, you prolly saying to yourself, "This brother tripping"
But this stuff is real
But ain't too many fellas would have the nerve to step up
And tell that lady what's up to let her know he's really pressed
Now getting straight to the bottom line
You're the type of kinda girl a gangsta needs by his side
So when you get emotional, I won't let you go
(When you cry, I won't let you go)
It's something I gotta tell you

[Chorus]
Don't mean to cut you off but the question is
So when you gon' be my girl? When you gon' be my girl, girl?
I wanna know when it comes to loving why you change the subject
You should know, girl, you know that I'm the man you want, oh yes I am
So girl, what's really good with ya?
So when you gon' be my girl?
All this playing 'round is getting old now
So baby, where do I stand? Tell me, girl
I don't mean to be rude but I gotta know
So when you gon' be my girl? When you gon' be my girl?
I wanna know when it comes to loving why you change the subject
You should know, girl, you know that I'm the man you want, I am the man you need
So girl, what's really good with ya?
So when you gon' be my girl?
All this playing 'round is getting old now
So baby, tell me where I stand

[Intro]
Haha, what's up ladies?
How y'all doing?
Yeah, I know what y'all need, all of y'all
And that's y'all gangsta boo right, come on
Mmm, yeah, huh, yeah
Oh, no, no

[Verse 1]
It was 6 o'clock on the dot
That's when I seen this cutie, she was chilling at the spot
She was with her girls, I was with my boys
All of a sudden, I asked her to come over and say
"Whaddup, ma, how'd you like to get to know me?
I'm not shy, I'll do anything for you and
I'm that guy, say I pick you up at 8
I promise I won't be  late"

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause all I ever wanted was someone I could hold on to
Someone who would never break my heart in two
Can I be the one for you?
Let's hang out and let's see

[Chorus]
Shawty want a rider (Gangsta boo)
I told her that I'd call her (It's true)
I'm not looking for no love but I think that you're the one
So come on, come on
Shawty want a baller (Gangata boo)
Someone who can spoil her (It's true)
I'm not looking for no love but I think that you're the one
So come on, come on

[Verse 2]
I never met no one like you before but I gotta take this chance
'Cause if I don't, I'll never know what this girl is really looking for
I may not have all the money, so who cares?
I may not have all the fancy cars, I'll still be there
But what I have to give you, baby, is so much more

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause all I ever wanted was someone I could hold on to
Someone who would never break my heart in two
Can I be the one for you?
Let's hang out and let's see

[Chorus]
Shawty want a rider (Gangsta boo)
I told her that I'd call her (It's true, told her that I'd call her)
I'm not looking for no love (Oh) but I think that you're the one
So come on, come on (Come on, girl)
Shawty want a baller (Aw yeah, gangata boo)
Someone who can spoil her (Oh, it's true, yeah, yeah)
I'm not looking for no love but I think that you're the one
So come on, come on

[Bridge]
Hey shawty, you're the one, nice lips, thick hips
Put me on, too tough, come on, girl, break me off
I can't see you with nobody else
Nobody's like young Chris, no
Few cats, hat back, I'm the one (I'm the one)
A few cats tried that, but they're done (They're done)
Come on, baby
Come on, baby, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Shawty want a rider (Gangsta boo, ah)
I told her that I'd call her, yes I did (It's true, yes, I did)
I'm not looking for no love but I think that you're the one
So come on, come on (Come on, girl)
Shawty want a baller (Aw yeah, gangata boo)
Someone who can spoil her (It's true, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'm not looking for no love (Oh yeah) but I think that you're the one
So come on, come on

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Intro]
Pretty girl pretty girl
Oh no here comes a pretty girl pretty girl
Uh oh here comes a pretty girl
Hey

[Verse 1]
I know what you are thinkin'
I know what you will say
You made up this whole far-fetched thing about the reasons that I have changed
Well I'm still the tiger
And the jungle's still my home
But she blew out my fire
And now my killer instincts are gone
What did you do?

[Chorus]
Everything's lost its worth to me
Everything in this world
Ever since it occurred to me
That you are the prettiest girls

[Verse 2]
My life is so amazing
Let me explain how it got that way
Well if happiness was standing at your door
I mean tell me what would you say?
But I'm no liar, and you rearranged my home
And I wonder how I don't get tired
Of loving the three of you instead of what I own
All that is gone

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
What are you doing to me?
What's so drastic all my friends see?
You say nothing, nothing, nothing
But it's really something, something, something
You won't answer me, and all the while
My heart just melts, from your innocent smile
It's strange
Oh God I think I have changed...
There's one thing that's sure
Is everyday I love you some more
My hand's been handcuffed and loved by you
So is there really anything I could do?
When...

[Chorus]
Dear Afeni

Sorry if it looks a little sloppy, I could've done a little better if I had the right pencils. Instead, I had to draw it in pen. Plus, I just kind of thought of the idea a little too late. But I've been drawing since I was 10, and I thought you might like it. Anyways, thank you for always being so kind to me. You are a true Queen, and I mean that in every sense of the word. I will never forget the opportunities you have given me. You will always be in my heart, my thoughts, and my prayers. As I have said before, you have no idea how much your son and his music has inspired, not only the "Hip Hop" world, but, speaking for myself, has inspired my whole career. He was, and still is, the true definition of a "Soldier." When I was feeling at my worst; (before fame, before Dre) I knew I could put that "2Pac" tape in, and suddenly, things weren't so bad. He gave me the courage to stand up and say "F**k the world!" "This is who I am! And if you don't like it, go f**k yourself!" Thank you for giving us his spirit, and yours! God Bless you!

Love

Marshall

[Chorus]

Can't compare, I been going crazy since the 80's fucker
Can't compare, I been going crazy since the 80's fucker
Crazy since the 80’s fuckin, crazy since the 80’s

[Verse 1]
If you wondering who it is I'm the youngest in charge
Back with another one of them classic ones, fuck with the boy
Say you tired of hired help come and fuck with the boss
Niggas say "Man you winning" fuck it I tell 'em of course
I get love like a star, units move, cake appear
412 PGH you hatin' cause we cakin' here
Ask around you'll hear about the noise the youngin's making here
Hit 'em with that 'Oh No', now I'm record breaking here
See this that slow flow you heard of
Seeing mo dough and re-ing more dro to burn up
Keep it low though before the po-po swerve up
Pull us to the side and them homos search us
Gotta keep the work up, cause I was taught supply-demand
Smoking putting Pistolvania on the map cause I'm the man
Hustle hard plus the ladies love the nasty flow, scrappy know
So why you hate me? Cause he crazy since the 80's (fucker)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Yeah it’s young Wiz ain’t nobody do it how I done it son
Killed ‘em with the first and gotta hit 'em with another one
Not quite the remix, you see this G-Shit?
For you to Pittsburgh ditty-bop to the beat with
Fresh with my A-1’s, keep a leaning fitted cap
For those who sick of rap thank God ya niggas back
A lot of niggas wack and that’s just sad to see
We in a marathon you cats are lapped to me
Khalifa still the same, ain’t nothing change but my change
And my foot got a lil deeper  up in the game
It’s hard seeing through all this reefer up in my brain
Let the trunk bang while you weaving and switching them lanes
Hope if you in the club let ‘em know you moving through
To pop something, roll something, man do what you do
18, making major moves that’s why they hate me brother
Plus I’m getting cakey I been crazy since the 80’s fucker

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Let me make it clear, when that cake appear
Ima make more in one day than most niggas make a year
I put my time in, (what you doin’ man?) nothing but grinding
Moving these units they coming back for what I’m supplying
I’m from the Steel-City, ya’ll niggas still lost
I’m the youngest in charge spittin' that real raw
My dutchies real long plus I work real hard
Fuck a battle dog I’ll show you how to make a real song
Or how to switch states, get cake from a mixtape
Couple hundred-thousand off my face from Myspace
You’ll be frustrated from tryna keep up with my pace
How I control the track you fools get over-lapped
You’ll get left in the dust just cause you lesser than us
And coming at the kid? Simply said it’s just pressing ya luck
See I was hungry on this grind when you was lazy brother
So why you hate me? I been crazy since the 80’s fucker

Skrt, Soulja (Soulja)
Ayy, Fame
Skrt, skrt, skrt
She told me add the bassline
And everything will be fine
She told me add the sound of the drums, drums
To set the mood and foundation
She told me add the bassline
And everything will be fine
She told me add the sound of the drums
To set the mood and foundation

Sweet sounds of July
Sweeter than a blackberry pie
Sweeter than the breeze of the night
The gat plays, hit the rewind
OH here’s the rhodes
Minor 9 insatiable
Sharp 11 losing control
Now here’s the vocal
Baby let it take over
Ridiculous flow
Meticulous glow
And limitless growth

[Hook:]
I got the bassline
I got the drumming drums
And I don’t waste time
I’m singing them songs
I got the bassline
I got the drumming drums
And I don’t waste time
I’m singing them songs

She told me add the bassline
And everything will be fine
She told me add the sound of the drums
To set the mood and foundation

Let it groove to the soul
Blind it with specifics in the goals
Find out which is illest, who knows?
Play the beats ganking at the shows
Let the bassline fly
Frequency emotion through the skies
Storms of melodies in the eye
Have the speakers going on all night
Sun room to the burst
Everybody’s got the groove curse
Everybody’s got the groove curse
Everybody’s got the groove curse

[Verse 1]
Silent night, holy night
All is calm, and all is bright
'Round yon virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Oh oh, sleep in heavenly peace

[Verse 2]
Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia
Christ the Savior is born, He's born
Christ the Savior is born

[Outro]
'Round yon virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Oh, sleep in heavenly peace
Sorry for party rocking
I'll be up in the bar, looking for a hottie to bone
I gotta drink in my hand, and a
Popping bottles in the house and models in the V.I.P
All the girls make out for the whole damn club to see
Let's go! People always say that my music's loud
Sorry for party rocking!

Leave those complaints, and turn it down
Sorry for party rocking!
Haters don't like, we got the spotlight
Sorry for party rocking!
When they talk shit, we just pick a line
Sorry for party rocking!

[Verse 1]
I think I'd like to go
Back home
And take it easy
There's a woman that
I'd like to get to know
Living there

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody seems to wonder
What it's like down here
I gotta get away
From this day-to-day
Running around
Everybody knows
This is nowhere

[Chorus]
Everybody, everybody knows
Everybody knows

[Verse 2]
Every time I think about
Back home
It's cool and breezy
I wish that I could be there
Right now
Just passing time

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody seems to wonder
What it's like down here
I gotta get away
From this day-to-day
Running around
Everybody knows
This is nowhere

[Chorus]
Everybody, everybody knows
Everybody knows
Press play, fast forward
Nonstop we have the beaten path before us
It was all there, in plain sight
Come on people, we have all seen the sunshine

We will never get back to
To the old school
To the old rounds, it's all about the new found
We are the newborn, the one who wanna bounce
We are the future and we are here to stay

We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back at the faded silhouette
We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back, look back
At the faded silhouette

Straight ahead on the pathway before us
Day by day, soon the change will come
Don't you know we took a big step forward
Just either way, we're gonna pull the trigger
And we're gonna get back to
To the old school
To the old grounds
It's all about the new founds
We are the newborn
The one who wanna battle the sky
We are the future and we are here to stay

We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back at the faded silhouette
We've come a long way since that day

We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back at the faded silhouette
We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back, look back
At the faded silhouette

My touch is the Midas
We de-plus your man to minus
My team blowing on that slam
Make you cough-cough that's Bronchitis
Put your hands up

Get that ass on the floor
Ladies put your lipstick up
Double entendre, double entendre
While you're hating I get money
Then I double up tonkers

If you're a freak, then ya coming home with me
And I know what you came here to do
Now bust it open let me see you get loose

Sylvie is a good old girl, from Florida so they say
She came up here last April to pass some time away

Now won't you bring me a little water, Sylvie?
Bring me a little water now?
Bring me a little water, Sylvie?
For my tired brow

Sylvie came here Wednesday
She came this morning by the light of the dawn
She comes up here now nearly all of the time
To see if she can carry on

Now won't you bring me a little water, Sylvie?
Bring me a little water now?
Bring me a little water, Sylvie?
For my tired brow

Sylvie says she loves me
She says it all of the time
She always gets behind me
When the hill is too high to climb
Now bring me a little water, Sylvie?
Bring me a little water now?
Bring me a little water, Sylvie?
For my tired brow

She brings beer and honey
Brings me slop and beans
Brings me coconuts and candy
Brings me turnip greens

Bring me a little water, Sylvie?
Bring me a little water now?
Bring me a little water, Sylvie?
For my tired brow
For my tired brow
Oh, for my tired brow
It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love

Purple kisses on your neck, thinking 'bout the day we met
Body dripping sweat, eat that, beat that pussy wet
Purple silhouettes, purple drank and cigarettes
She is my addiction, nigga need a Nicorette
Trill-ass misses, fuck her where a nigga rest
ASAP tat cause that's what a nigga rep
Style fresh to death, show you bitches how to flaunt
And the Yves St. Laurent, or her Isabel Marant
Like when Jay Z out, tryna take B out
All these magazines try to play me out
All my ex-girls tryna fade me out
By the ending I was finished, so it's crazy how

It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love

Okay wait, now hold up, let me switch that flow up
Call her to come over and you just try to control her
Ever since I growed up, I been got my dough up
Now I'm smoking more blunts and I'm sipping 'til I'm poured up
Tore up from the floor up, tore down from my toes up
Get throwed 'til I throw up, but I'm pimping like I'm 'sposed to
Got the illest chocha, reason why I chose her
Mami is a rider and see me I be that roller
She hate a rap nigga walking with his nose up
She date a rap nigga walking with his toaster
So take your picture, get your close-up
Another fake imitation, just a poser on a poster
I did it again for my culture
Went Tesla roadster, traded it in for a Rover
Just to get a nigga chauffeured
Driver pull over, tipping and picking these hoes up
I'm slipping from feeling this sober
Window is rolled up, this purple kissed on my shoulder
Undress and I sex and I hold her
Caressing her breast with my head on her chest I'm all on her
It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love

It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love
If I leave here tomorrow
Would you still remember me?
For I must be traveling on, now
'Cause there's too many places I've got to see
But, if I stayed here with you, girl
Things just couldn't be the same
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you can not change
Oh... oh... oh... oh... oh...
And the bird you cannot change
And this bird you cannot change
Lord knows I can't change
Bye, bye, baby it's been a sweet love
Yea, yea
Though this feeling I can't change
But please don't take it so badly
'Cause the lord knows I'm to blame
But, if I stayed here with you girl
Things just couldn't be the same
Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you can not change
Oh... oh... oh... oh... oh...
And this bird you cannot change
And this bird you cannot change
Lord knows, I can't change
Lord help me, I can't change
Lord I can't change
Won't you fly high free bird yea
(woah)

The way she came into the place
I knew right then and there
There was something different
About this girl

The way she moved
Her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion

As she stalked the room
I could feel the aura
Of her presence
Every head turned
Feeling passion and lust

The girl was persuasive
The girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous
I never knew but I was walking the line
She never thought that I would have the time
She never think that I was going alone
She never thought and then she ganged up the phone
She's so

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to god
'cause I know how
Lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
But you're no damn lover
Friend of mine

She came at me in sections
With the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her
Web of sin
A touch, a kiss
A whisper of love
I was at the point
Of no return
Deep in the darkness of
Passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's
Strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive
This girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous

She never thought that I was walking the line
She never think that I would have the time
She never thought that I were going alone
She never think and then she ganged up the phone
She's so

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to god
'cause I know how
Lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
But you're no damn lover
Friend of mine
(but you're no, but you're no)
(but you're no, but you're no)

(but you're no)

[?] vegetation

[?] voice of information

[?] constellation

And then it happened
She touched me

For the lips of
A strange woman
Drop as a honeycomb
And her mouth was
Smoother than oil
But her inner spirit and words
Were as sharp as
A two-edged sword
But I loved it
'cause it's dangerous

I never thought that I was walking the line
She never think that I would have the time
She never thought that I were going alone
She never think, and then she ganged up the phone
She's so

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to god
'cause I know how
Lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
But you're no damn lover
Friend of mine

(She came at me in sections
With the eyes of desire
I fell trapped)

(The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous)

[Instrumental]
I've been watching you
You've been hurting too
You give all your love
Nothing left to show
I have been there too
Alone in my despair
Watching life go by
No one who to share
Boy you got it bad
But I got something good
I want you good in every way yeah
You will never feel alone
My touch is such a rush
It over flows

Chorus:
I will give to you the love you seek
And more
So what are you waiting for
I will give to you
The love you seek and more
X3
Baby here we are
Standing face to face
Just the two of us
Locked in your embrace
Now i got it bad
But you got something good
Won't you treat me good
In every way
Yeah
Are you ready
I can feel your passion
And your love
It over flows
I will give to you the love you seek and more
So what are you waiting for
I will give to you the love you seek and more
Ive got the love you seek x3
Ive got the love
I will give to you the love you seek and more
So what are you waiting for
I will give to you the love you seek and more
X2
Uhh, uhh, uhh
You ready B? Let's go get 'em
Look for me, Young, B, cruising down the Westside highway
Doing what we like to do, our, way
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason
All of my dates been blind dates
But today, I got my thoroughest girl wit me
I'm mashing the gas, she's grabbing the wheel
It's true to the heart, she rides with me
The new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during 'Sex and the City'
She gets Carrie fever but soon as the show is over
She's right back to being my soldier
'Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
What ever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track mami is keeping me focused
So let's, lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie & Clyde, Hov' and B
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you loving
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humping
Now they 'bout nothing if ever you mad about something
It won't be that, oh no it won't be that
I don't be at, places where we comfy at
With no be-atch, oh no, you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect, nobody walking this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you working at Kermain, Birkin Bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, aviator lens
600 drops, Mercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
(Talk to 'em B)
If I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if it's somebody takes my place
Yeah-hee
(Break it down for 'em)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
And all of my trust if you was my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride 'til the very end, it's me and my boyfriend
You played hooky from school and you can't go out to play, yeah
Mama said
For the rest of the week in your room you gotta stay, yeah

Now you feel like
The whole world's pickin’ on you
But deep down inside
You know it ain't true

You’re in punishment
‘Cause your mama wants to raise you the right way, yeah
But you don't care
‘Cause you already made up your mind
You wanna run away, yeah
You're on your way ...

Runaway child, running wild
Runaway child, running wild
Better go back home
Better go back home
Where you belong
Where you belong
Roaming through the city
Going nowhere fast
You're on your own at last
Hey it's getting late, where will you sleep?
Gettin’ kinda hungry ...
You forgot to bring something to eat
Oh, lost with no money
You start to cry
But remember, you left home
Wanting to be grown
So dry your weepin’ eyes

Siren screamin’ down
Neon light is flickin’
You want your mama
Ah there's nothing for you
You're frightened and confused
I want my mama
But she's much too far away
She can't hear a word you say
You heard some frightening news on the radio
About little boys running away from home
And their parents don't see them no more
You wanna hitch a ride and go home
But your mama told you never trust a stranger
And you don't know which way to go
Streets are dark and deserted
Not a sound nor sign of life
Oh, how you long to hear your mother's voice
‘Cause you're lost and alone
But remember you made the choice

Run away child, running wild
Better go back home where you belong
Run away child, running wild
Better go back home where you belong

You're lost in this great big city (Go back home where you belong)
Not one familiar face, ain't it a pity (Go back home where you belong)
Oh runaway child, running wild
You better go back home where you belong

Mama, mama please come and see about me
But she's much too far away
She can't hear a word you say
I want my mama
You're frightened and confused
Which way will you choose?

[Intro: Mila J]
I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you
I need you, I need you (Lemme see)
I need you, I need you

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
We poppin' like ayo
All my bitches got real hair chillin' with the top down

Z (Z), wake up like I gotta get it (Get it)
And I got an engine full of trunk space
I get money three ways, fuckin' bitches three ways
Seven different foreigns, plus she's no hablé
But I make that bitch walk for some cheesecake (Cheesecake)
Yeah, I'm the coldest nigga, icy
Lookin' in the mirror like I wish I can be me
She too into me, I'm more into money
My hobby's her body, that pussy's my lobby
I'ma eat it (Eat it), I'ma eat it (Eat it)
I don't lie, hold my dick, too conceited
Uh, told her she's my wife for the weekend (For the weekend)
But don't be actin' like I need you

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Tyga & Both]
'Cause we poppin' like ayo (Ha! Yeah)
All my bitches got real hair chillin' with the top down

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I'm in the Rolls, you don't roll right (Roll right)
My chain shine brighter than a strobe light (Yeah)
I'm tryna fuck Coco, this don't concern Ice
If I motorboat, she gon' motorbike (Ha!)
A nigga ain't worried about nothin'
Rehabilitation just had me worried about fuckin'
Money, decision-makin', only worried 'bout stuntin'
She worried 'bout me, her nigga worried 'bout cuffin'
I wanna see her body (Body)
Then she said, "Get inside of me
I wanna feel you, baby" (Yeah)
Just bring the animal right out of me
We lovin', she love it
Especially when I go down on her
Now we fuckin', she thuggin'
Gettin' loud

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Tyga & Both]
'Cause we poppin' like ayo
All my bitches got real hair chillin' with the top down

[Verse 3: Chris Brown & Tyga]
Now, now I can spot your bitch from a mile away ('way)
Valentine in that pussy, it's a holiday
Uh, you losin' money, I win mills, Dr. J (J)
She gon' to follow my lead, Simon Says
Paper, paper, I'm ridin' 'scrapers in California ('fornia)
Car smell like ammonia, we got that stank on us
Never been a Outkast, that stank on ya
From the ghetto but my bitch like Apollonia
We in the hood, tatted like a Mexican
Car too fast, give a fuck about pedestrians
Uh, and my section less niggas, more lesbians
Got your bitch, I'm that nigga

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Tyga & Both]
Yeah, we poppin' like ayo (Ha! Yeah)
All my bitches got real hair chillin' with the top down (Yeah)

But don't be actin' like I need you

[Outro: Tyga & Mila J]
Yeah, this that fly shit (I need you)
King shit only
Drop top, no roof, ha!
(I need you)

[Verse 1]
Back when I was a kid I used to drive alone
Always feeling like I was stuck out here on my own
Now my pockets is full and I'm still riding slow
What goes on in my head, don't nobody really know
I'm in the light, all on my life get put on display
Nothing to call my own, ducking, dodging everyday
Put that camera phone away and keep it real with me
Time to time again I'm searching for reality
And feeling so alone

[Chorus]
Alone again (x3)
Alone...

[Verse 2]
I'm smoking that weed everyday but never hide my faith
They calling my phone, I don't even got the time a day
Don't know their motives anymore that's why I hesitate
I'm tired of partying, getting drunk, I'm trying to elevate
I remember back in the day, I ain't had no cash
I was coming up off of nothing hoping it would last
Now it's 2015 and I got it all
Feeling like I did, when I started on my own
Out here all alone

[Chorus]
Alone again (x3)
Alone...

[Outro]
No use looking out
It’s within that brings that
Lonely feeling
Understand that when you leave here
You’ll be clear
Among the better men
This time the bullet cold rocked ya
A yellow ribbon instead of a swastika
Nothin' proper about ya propaganda
Fools follow rules when the set commands ya
Said it was blue
When ya blood was read
That's how ya got a bullet blasted through ya head

Blasted through ya head
Blasted through ya head

I give a shout out to the living dead
Who stood and watched as the feds cold centralized
So serene on the screen
You were mesmerized
Cellular phones soundin' a death tone
Corporations cold
Turn ya to stone before ya realize
They load the clip in omnicolour
Said they pack the nine, they fire it at prime time
Sleeping gas, every home was like Alcatraz
And mutha fuckas lost their minds
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say how high
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say how high

Run it!

Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say how high
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say how high

Checka, checka, check it out
They load the clip in omnicolour
Said they pack the nine, they fire it at prime time
Sleeping gas, every home was like Alcatraz
And mutha fuckas lost their minds

No escape from the mass mind rape
Play it again jack and then rewind the tape
And then play it again and again and again
Until ya mind is locked in
Believin' all the lies that they're tellin' ya
Buyin' all the products that they're sellin' ya
They say jump and ya say how high
Ya brain-dead
Ya gotta fuckin' bullet in ya head
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say how high
Just victims of the in-house drive-by
They say jump, you say how high

Uggh! Yeah! Yea!

Ya standin' in line
Believin' the lies
Ya bowin' down to the flag
Ya gotta bullet in ya head

Ya standin' in line
Believin' the lies
Ya bowin' down to the flag
Ya gotta bullet in ya head

A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head
A bullet in ya head!
A bullet in ya head!
A bullet in ya head!
A bullet in ya head!
A bullet in ya head!
A bullet in ya head!
A bullet in ya head!
Ya gotta bullet in ya fuckin' head!
Yeah!

[Verse 1]
It is the springtime of my loving
The second season I am to know
You are the sunlight in my growing
So little warmth I've felt before
It isn't hard to feel me glowing
I watched the fire that grew so low, oooh, oh

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
It is the summer of my smiles
Flee from me, keepers of the gloom
Speak to me only with your eyes
It is to you I give this tune
Ain't so hard to recognize, oh
These things are clear to all from time to time, ooh
Oh, oh

[Verse 3]
Ah, talk, talk, talk, talk
Hey!
I've felt the coldness of my winter
I never thought it would ever go
I cursed the gloom that set upon us, upon us, upon us
But I know that I love you so, ohhhh, oh
But I know that I love you so

[Outro]
These are the seasons of emotion
And like the winds they rise and fall
This is the wonder of devotion
I see the torch we all must hold
This is the mystery of the quotient quotient
Ah, upon us all, upon us all a little rain must fall
Just a little rain, oh yeah
Uhh, ooh, yeah yeah yeah
Everybody makes mistakes
But I feel alright when I come undone
You're not not making me wait
But it seems alright as long as something's happening
I try to make you late
But you fight me out like a fire does
You try making me wait
But it feels alright as long as something's happening
Get your payments from the nation
For your trials and tribulations
You try to make me wait
You come around when it's come undone
Everybody makes you late
And it's never you, because you're always thinkin'
I try making you wait
And you give me some like you give it good
Everybody makes mistakes
But it seems it's mine that always keep on stingin'
Get your payments from the nation
For your trial and tribulations
Get your payments from the nation
For your trial and tribulations
You try making me wait
But you come undone when you come undone
Everybody makes mistakes
But it's always mine that seem to keep on stickin'
Get your payments from the nation, for your trials and tribulations
Get your payments from the nation, for your trials and tribulations

I really can't stay
Baby, it's cold outside
I've got to go away
Baby, it's cold out there
This evening has been
Been hoping
That you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands
They're just like ice

My mother
Will start to worry
Beautiful
What you're hurry
And father
Will be
Pacing the floor
Listen
To that fireplace
Roar
So really
I'd better scurry
Beautiful
Please don't hurry
Well, maybe
Just a half
A drink more
Put some records on
While i pour
And the neighbors
Might think
Baby
It's bad out there
Say
What's in this drink?
No cabs
To be had out there
I wish i knew how
Your eyes
Are like starlight now
To break the spell
I'll take your hat
Your hair looks swell

I ought to say
No, no, no sir
Mind if i
Mmove in closer?
At least i'm gonna say
That i tried
What's the sense of
Hurtin' my pride?
I really can't stay
Baby don't hold out
Baby
But it's cold outside
I simply must go
But baby
It's cold outside
The answer is no
I say
It's cold out there
The welcome
Has been how lucky
That you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out that window
Man that's hard

My sister
Will be suspicious
Gosh
Your lips look delicious
My brother
Will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical
Shore
My maiden
Aunt's mind is vicious
Gosh
Your lips are delicious
Well maybe
Just a cigarette more
Oh
Never such a blizzard
Before
I've got to go home
Baby
You'll freeze out there
Say, lend me your coat
It's up
To your knees out there
You've really been grand
I thrill
When you touch my hand
But don't you see
How can you do
This thing to me

There's bound
To be talk tomorrow
Think
Of my lifelong sorrow
At least there
Will be plenty implied
If you caught pneumonia
And died
I really can't stay
Get over that old lie

Oh
But it's cold outside
Each night I ask, the stars up above
Why must I be a teenager in love
Why must I be a teenager in love
Put me in your milling machine
I never thought you could act so mean
Now I'm wondering what to do
To see if you could love me too
Each night I ask, the stars up above
Why must I be a teenager in love
Why must I be a teenager in love

Each night I ask the stars up above
Why must I be a teenager in love
Why must I be a teenager in love
Though my knees are getting weak
And my brain is getting flatter
Something is near, to tell me it's been badder
I don't know just what to do
To see if you could love me too
Each night I ask the stars up above
Why must I be a teenager in love
Why must I be a teenager in love
Its like whatever I do
Just can't get through to you
Im never gonna tell you nothing wrong
Listen

Now, now she love me, shorty, I loved her
Used to jump up in the Maybach and roll out
Used to care, she used to share
The love that she used to give me can't be found

I lost my way, she said shed stay
And lately I been sleeping with a ghost
My stock is down and out
I used to be worth my weight in gold

That was before the great depression kicked in and rocked us
And that was before the hurricane came in and stopped us
I told you to leave but you lied to me when you said that
Baby, no worries, I promise to get us back

I know sorries, just wouldn't do it
Her heart is obliterated, Im trying to travel through
But its like moving mountains
Its like moving mountains, hey
But I keep climbing and hoping things would change
Then the sky turns gray
And the water from the rain washes progress away
Its like moving mountains
Its like moving mountains

Why you just leave me, just leave me be
Just leave me, just leave me be
Why you just leave me, just leave me be
Why you just leave me, just leave me be

She, she dont touch me, I dont touch her
We ain't really ever say a word
I really wanna give her everything she deserves
But the bad took away the girl

She thinks that Im full of it, arguments
Always pissed, man Im tired
Every kiss that I miss
Girl you know Im trying

You never believe when I say
And I never believe it when you say
I love you, and I shouldn't complain about it
I should take it like a man and walk up out it
Cause we will never be the same
Ive been standing in gas
And you have been the flame

So I know sorry, just wouldn't do it
Her heart is obliterated, Im trying to get through
Gotta move this mountain
Its like moving mountains

But I keep climbing and hoping things would change
Then the sky turns gray
And the water from the rain washes progress away
Its like moving mountains
Its like moving mountains

Well baby why you just leave me, just leave me be
Just leave me, just leave me be
Why you just leave me, just leave me be
Why you just leave me, just leave me be

This must be a slow death that I'm traveling on
It feels so wrong, I'm barely holding on
See no matter what it takes, I've gotta get it together baby yeah

And these hills that I'm traveling up
She ain't showing me love, I'm down on my luck
Ooh, I'm done, oh
I know sorries just wouldn't do it
Her heart is obliterated, I'm trying, I'm trying my boo
But it's like moving mountains
It's like moving mountains

But I keep climbing and hoping things would change
Then the sky turns gray
And the water from the rain washes progress away
Its like moving a mountain
I'm trying to move this mountain

Well baby why you just leave me, just leave me be
Just leave me, just leave me be
Why you just leave me, just leave me be
Why you just leave me, just leave me be, oh
Baby baby
I love to love you baby
I love to love you baby
I'm feelin' sexy
I wanna hear you say my name boy
If you can reach me
You can feel my burning flame
I'm feelin' kind of n-a-s-t-y I just might take you home with me
Baby the minute I feel your energy
Your vibe's just taken over me
Start feelin' so crazy babe
Lately, I feel the funk coming over me
I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythm's got me feelin' so crazy babe
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin' all my girls
We're gonna turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl I'm
Callin' all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party
You're so sexy
Tonight I am all yours boy
The way your body
Moves across the floor
You got me feelin n-a-s-t-y, I just might take you home with me
Baby the minute i feel your energy
The vibe's just taken over me
Start feelin' so crazy babe
Lately, I feel the funk coming over me
I don't know what's gotten into me
The rhythm's got me feelin' so crazy babe
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin' all my girls
We're gonna turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl I'm
Callin' all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party
I love to love you baby (I love to love you baby)
I love to love you baby (I love to love you baby)
I love to love you baby (I love to love you baby)
I love to love you baby (I love to love you baby)
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl
I'm callin' all my girls
We're gonna turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl I'm
Callin' all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl (I'll be you naughty girl)
I'm callin' all my girls
We're gonna turn this party out
I know you want my body
Tonight I'll be your naughty girl I'm
Callin' all my girls
I see you look me up and down
And I came to party
Alone she lays waiting
Surrounded by gloom
Invaded by shadows
Painting the
The light from the window
Cuts through the air
And pins the child lying there
Scared of the moon

She pulls up the covers
And shivers in fright
She hides from the color
That rides on the night
The light through the window
That lights up the sky
And causes her mournful cry
Scared of the moon

There's nothing wrong
Don't be bothered they said
It's just childish fantasies turning your head
No need to worry
It's really too soon
But there she lies shivering
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon

The years go by swiftly
And soon childhood ends
But life is still fearful
When evening descends
The fear of a child
Still intrudes the night
Returning on beams of light
Scared of the moon

The feeling of terror
She felt as a youth
Has turned from a fantasy
Into the truth
The moon is the enemy
Twisting her soul
And taking its fearful toll
Scared of the moon

But now there are others who sit in a room
And wait for the sunlight to brighten their gloom
Together they gather
Their lunacy shade
But knowing just why they're scared
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon

[Intro]
(Turn the lights on)

[Verse 1]
Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you
When I close my eyes, I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale, can you hold my hands and be my guide?

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

[Chorus]
You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way, I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
(Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)

[Verse 2]
I mention you when I say my prayers
I wrap you around all of my thoughts
Boy, you're my temporary high
I wish that when I wake up you're there
To wrap your arms around me for real
And tell me you'll stay by my side

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds filled with stars cover the skies (Cover the skies)
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby
What kind of dream is this?

[Chorus]
You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
(Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)

[Bridge]
Tattoo your name across my heart
So it will remain
Not even death could make us part
What kind of dream is this?

[Chorus]
You could be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me, your love's too good to be true
(Turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere
Baby, 'long as you're here, I'll be floating on air
'Cause you're mine
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you
(Turn the lights on)
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you

[Spoken OVERHEAD VOICE]
For over seventy years miners of Durham County have come together once a year for their demonstration and gala day. This was the first Durham rally since the pits handed over to the people. This year one of the popular attraction was Mr. Herbert Morrison, who spoke of the link of solidarity between miners and other workers

[Spoken HERBERT MORRISON]
I want you men of the pits to come through. I want these streets clean of nationalization to succeed triumphantly. The whole country is watching to see how this great new organization, this new adventure, this new experiment, comes out. The great experiment of socialism in a democracy depends on you. The whole future we are trying to conduct in our country is for all our people and all our children, and it depends on you

[ENSEMBLE, MINERS]
Through the dark, and
Through the hunger
Through the night and
Through the fear
Through the fight and
Years of hardship
Through the storms and
Through the tears
And although your feet are weary
And although your soul is worn
And although they'll try to break you
And although you'll feel alone
We will always stand together
In the dark, right through the storm
We will stand, shoulder to shoulder
To keep us warm
And the stars look down on the mean and hungry
And the stars look down and show the way
And the stars look down and we'll stand together
To see a day
When the stars look down and know our history
When the stars look down upon our past
And the stars look down and see a future bright at last
When we'll stand as one, beneath the sun

And though our hands are bruised and bleeding
And our lungs are full with dust
And our hearts are near to breaking
We will never forgo the trust
We will fight through pain and hunger
Every arrow, every knife
And we will never give the hope up
Of a proud and honest life
So we will always stand together
Through the frost, the hail, the snow
The stars are our redemption
And so we know

[Spoken MINER}
We're out!

[Spoken ENSEMBLE]
(Cheering)

[SINGLE MINER]
The stars look down when we're abandoned
Look down in the heart of night

To see the light

The stars look down upon our struggle
The stars look down and know the past
The stars look down and see a future bright at last
When we'll stand as one, beneath the sun

All out together
All out as one
All out for victory
Till we've won
All out together
All out as one
All out for victory
All out till we've won

[Spoken BILLY]
See ya, Michael

[BILLY]
Take me up and hold me gently
Raise me up and hold me high
Through the nights under darkness
Will come a day when we will fly
And although we've been rejected
And although we've been outcast
We will find a new tomorrow
When we come to rest at last

And we will stand there proudly
And we will never walk alone
And we will be returned
Back to our home

[ENSEMBLE]
And the stars look down at their reflection
And the stare look down and there's a light
When the stars look down they'll see the justice
And the right
And the stars look down and see the struggle
And the stars look down and know the pain
And the stars will lead us back to where light shines again

Where we'll stand as one beneath the sun
One beneath the sun

Causing me to yank they arm impose like I would do them harm
Now I'm saying thank you cause they tell me

Gobble and swallow a nut up
Shut up and get my cash
Backhanded, pimp-slapped backwards and left stranded
Just pop ya collar, pimp convention, hoes for a dollar
Six-deuce in a plush, six-deuce Impala
Pimping hoes from Texas to Guatemala
Bitch niggas pay for hoes, just to lay with hoes
Relax one night, and pay to stay with hoes
Captain Save-'Em-All-Day, well save this dick

You ain't into hitting pussy or hitting the switch
You into hitting bitches all for the grip, you punk bitch

Six-Two and Hittman:
I got these freaky hoes clapping they hands, stomping they feet
Every now and then they put they mouth on me
Nowadays a G like me can't even call it
A twenty-four year old pussy fiend and freakaholic
Pimping bitches on the regular, I put that on the G
A hustler and a player, nowadays it pays to be
Let me drop some shit about this bitch I used to know
She gave your boy the head and said don't let nobody know
A bonafide pro, I had to grab the ho
She got freaky in your '64, I skeeted in her throat
Been knowing the ho for four days, pimping repays
And I bet you didn't know that she go both ways
She ate her best friend, I left them hoes at the mote'
They be beeping me and shit, but we don't kick it no mo'
Them hot hoes is fiending, they on the nuts
But bitch, I'm out your pussy when I nut, fo' real
(Xxplosive)
I just can't believe
Where my life was at
All that I know is that my heart was broken
And I don't ever wanna go back
Ain't no explanation
How I saw the light
He found me and set me free
And it brought me back to life
Blame it on the transformation
Changed down to the core
His love is real
And I can't sit still
Cause my name's not shamed no more
Great God Almighty, gonna change this
Great God Almighty, He gonna change me
You gotta shake, shake, shake

Shake, shake, shake like you changed
Maybe He came to you
When everything seemed fine
Or maybe your world was upside down
And hit you right between the eyes

Brand new looks so good on you
So shake like you've been changed
Come on and shake, shake, shake like you changed
Shake, shake, shake like you changed
Shake, shake
Great God Almighty, done changed me
Great God Almighty, He done changed me
Around the world I've searched for you
I traveled on when hope was gone to keep a rendezvous
I knew somewhere, sometime, somehow
You'd look at me and I would see the smile you're smiling now

It might have been in County Down
Or in New York, in gay Paree , or even London town
No more will I go all around the world
For I have found my world in you

Instrumental-first verse

It might have been in County Down
Or in New York, in gay Paree , or even London town
No more will I go all around the world
For I have found my world in you
Young Mula, baby
You thought it was over?

I wasn't born last night
I know these hoes ain't right
But you was blowing up her phone last night
But she ain't have her ringer nor her ring on last night, oh
Nigga, that's that nerve
Why give a bitch your heart when she'd rather have a purse?
Why give a bitch an inch when she'd rather have nine?
You know how the game goes
She be mine by half time, I'm the shit, oh
Nigga, that's that nerve
You all about her, and she all about hers
Birdman Junior in this bitch, no flamingos
And I done did everything, but trust these hoes
(CB fuck with me!)

When a rich nigga want ya
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya
These hoes ain't loyal
These hoes ain't loyal
Yeah, yeah, let me see
Just got rich
Took a broke nigga bitch
I can make a broke bitch rich
But I don't fuck with broke bitches

Got a white girl with some fake titties
I took her to Dubai with me
Eyes closed, smoking marijuana
Rolling up that Bob Marley
I'm a rasta
She wanna do drugs
Smoke weed, get drunk
She wanna see a nigga trapped
She wanna fuck all the rappers

When a rich nigga want you (want you baby)
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya (nothing no)
These hoes ain't loyal (no they ain't)
These hoes ain't loyal
Yeah, yeah, let me see

Black girl with a big booty
If she a bad bitch, let's get to it right away
We up in this club
Bring me the bottles
I know girl, that you came in this bitch with your man
That's a no no girl
All this money in the air
I wanna see you dance
Just got rich
Took a broke nigga bitch
I can make a broke bitch rich
But I don't fuck with broke bitches

When a rich nigga want you (want you baby)
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya (no, nothing)
These hoes ain't loyal
These hoes ain't loyal
Yeah, yeah, let me see

With ciroc in the system
Ain't no telling will I fuck them, will I diss them
That's what they be yelling, I'm a pimp by blood
No relation, I don't chase 'em, I replace 'em
LVs, Hermes, Dolces
Them hoes ain't loyal. Man, they rotate
School me to the game, now I know my duty
Put her in a Lotus
She was riding in a hoopty
Fuck that bitch
I got my own hoe
Fuck your weed
I got my own smoke
Had to put my mink back on
Tell that bitch
Put a ring back on
Montana
Come on, come on, girl
Why you frontin'?
Baby show me something
When I call her, she gon' leave
And I bet that bottom dollar she gon' cheat
Come on, come on, girl
Why you frontin'?
Baby show me something
You just spent your ring on her
And it's all for nothing

When a rich nigga want you (want you baby)
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya (can't do nothing for you)
These hoes ain't loyal
These hoes ain't loyal
Yeah, yeah, let me see
When a rich nigga want you (want you baby)
And your nigga can't do nothing for ya
These hoes ain't loyal (they be playing games)
These hoes ain't loyal
Yeah, yeah, let me see
Yeah, yeah, let me see
Yeah, yeah, let me see
Let me see
These hoes ain't loyal
Let me see
Well it was like a party
But the kids seem to scatter off
(Kids seem to scatter off)
You told me all those lies
That I said you did
And I can't give you one more chance
But I betcha I will show you
That the pick of a letter comes a little thicker
(And I said it would)
And it's been comin' for a long time
L

Become a victim on the verge, I'll kick your ass now
E

You been wastin' time
Are you out of your mind
Well you show me some love
With intentions so high
You probably need a place to count your cash
(Need a place to count your cash)
You said you're sorry so many times
And I'm sorry that you ever did
Well you can take your life of love
And stick it up in your main frame
'Cause there'll be no more second chances
No more hot romances
(And I like it this way)
(So let me break it down for you)
L
Let's get you ready for another, another lifetime

Better stop playin' me start lovin' me
I ain't the same woman givin' love for free
All my life sittin', thinkin' how to please you
Been flyin' so long now, my screws are loose
'Cause you play to lose
Now it's time to move
'Cause I'm sick and tired of playin' the fool
Would you play the lose?
And I play to win
Tried not to sin
Tried to be your friend
Like every other girl
Never sexed your friends
But it's over now
And you saying, "How?
I found something new
That worth the while
Instead of meesin' with a bump cat poster child
But I'm focused now
People saying, "Wow!
In place of a frown on my face, a smile
You must be out yo mind
I have no time to get you ready for a love of a liftime

Want you to want me baby
Just like I want you

Oh, I'll give you all the love

But I'm gonna change your mind
Someway, somehow, aw baby

I want you, the right way

You can play brand new to all the other chicks out here
But I know what you are, what you are, baby

I guess when you have one too many, makes it hard, it could
Be easy

When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep

And dreams of
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Every time she closed her eyes

When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth
Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear a waterfall
In the night the stormy night she'll close her eyes
In the night the stormy night away she'd fly
And dreams of
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh
She'd dream of
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh oh oh oh oh oh-oh-oh-oh

La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
And so lying underneath those stormy skies
She'd say, "oh, ohohohoh I know the sun must set to rise"

This could be
Oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh
Paradise
Oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh
Paradise
Oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh
Paradise
Whoa-oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh

This could be
Oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh

Oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh

Whoa-oh-oh oh-oooh oh-oh-oh

Well, you said you had enough
You said that you were leavin
I said, "Shove off honey, baby, I ain't grievin'
Pack your bags and pull out this evenin
Theres a wide open road"
On Saturday mornin' you where nowhere about it
And so I searched the town but you had done pulled out
I looked north, east and west and then a leadin' south
I saw a wide open road
Theres a wide open road
Its leadin south from my abode
If you stick around and turn your damper down
Theres a wide open road
Well, the reason I was lookin for you all over town
Was to tell you that your kitty cat is still around
And you left your weddin' ring when you went
Down that wide open road
If you gonna stay away then honey let me know
How to cook hot biscuits, how to roll a dough
Every thing's gone crazy since I told you to go
Down that wide open road
Theres a wide open road
And honey, I want you to know
You can look down south or you can turn back home
And theres a wide open road

[M:] Keep on lovin' me honey, keep on lovin' me true

[T:] Baby, I'm gonna love you no matter what you do

[M:] Just so long as I can have it all, nothin' but you

[Both:] So don't you take your love, don't take it away from me

[T:] 'Cause I would stop right where I stand

[M:] I'd just be afraid of a man

[Both:] Don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
'Cause if you leave you might as well take the air I breathe

[M:] Keep on lovin' me honey, don't you go nowhere

[T:] Don't you know I'm satisfied with your tender care?

[M:] And I get my inspiration, darlin', just knowin' you're there

[Both:] So don't you take your love, don't take it away from me

[T:] 'Cause like a leaf out on a tree

[M:] You've become a part of me

[Both:] Don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
'Cause if you leave you might as well take the air I breathe

[Both:] Would you take the heavens out of the sky
Imagine what the world would be like if the rivers ran dry

[M:] Oh Tammi

[T:] What good am I without you

[M:] I can't do without you, darlin'

[Both:] Like a sea wihout a shore
Kicking forever more

[M:] Keep on lovin' me honey, don't you change your mind

[T:] Sugar, I can't bear the thought of ever leavin' you behind

[M:] No matter what I do, another you I'll never find

[Both:] So don't you take your love, don't take it away from me

[T:] 'Cause I would stop right where I stand

[M:] I'd just be afraid of a man

[Both:] Don't you take your love, don't take it away from me
'Cause if you leave you might as well take the air I breathe-aca

Sorry for Party Rocking

Poppin bottles in the house with models in the V.I.P

(Workshop noises)
3...2...1...Zero...
Ya! Ha ha ha ha ha
I may run and hide
When you're screamin' my name, alright
But let me tell you now
There are prices to fame, alright
All of our time spent in flashes of light
All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life
Looking at the crowd
And I see your body sway c'mon
Wishin' I could thank you in a different way c'mon
'Cause all of your time spent keeps us alive
All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger than life
All of your time spent keeps us alive
All you people can't you see can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down
You can make it right
And that makes you larger than life
Yeah every time we're down
Yeah you can make it right
Yeah and that's what makes you larger than life
All you people can't you see, can't you see
How your love's affecting our reality
Every time we're down, you can make it right
And that makes you larger
That makes you larger
That makes you larger than life

[Verse 1]
When the blues moved north to Chicago they came
And I caught some myself in this blind alley and rain
Close to the L with its clattering train
Near an ornate theater where I soon will be playing
Soon will be playing
I soon will be playing
Soon will be playing

[Verse 2]
So I said hello for you, when I saw a stylish girl
Walking by on the sidewalk with her hair all in a swirl
From the wind that was growing at the end of the day
And I wondered what would be coming my way
Oh what's coming my way
What's coming my way
Coming my way

[Verse 3]
You know I been to Chicago, I was here once before
And the rain kept on pounding outside that stage door
I was singing and drinking with love in my heart
I was younger and stronger while life played it’s part
Life played it’s part
Whoa, life played it’s part
Life played it’s part

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Let us not be strangers if we come to know
Things about each other that come and they go
As friendship is everything if love is to last
And I have my guard down and love passes fast
Love passes fast
Love passes fast
Oh, love passes fast, yeah

[Outro]
Say hello to Chicago
Say hello
Say hello to Chicago

[Intro: sample]
I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga

[Chorus: x4]
Ain't I clean? That machine, super cool, super mean
I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga

[talking over the Chorus: T.I.]
Yeah, so
You already know, Hey
I'm the hottest nigga you done heard in a long time
Introducing you to the hottest nigga you heard in a long time
Hey

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Mega pimp, super clean, the coolest in the universe
Niggas hating on what he doing just mad cause they ain't do it first
His name pop up when you hit play or on your Google search
Bitches bow they head and bend they knees just like they do in church
Drop dope into her purse before you get into her skirt
She agree to do the work before she get into the vert
Till my pine box drop down into the dirt
I'm a be by far the hottest nigga, known to the Earth
In the air, I fly, can't compare my
Swagger to another rapper, don't you dare try
Anyone with a pair of eyes can look and see
No legacy will ever be next to me or near by
Though I invite you all to try, hey, I'm a fair guy
Just approach with caution, be aware because I don't share my
Throne, my crown I own
Hottest flow on any song, I'm on, I'm gone, nigga

[Break: sample]
I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga

[Chorus]

[talking over Chorus: T.I.]
Hey! B.o.B, you up next, baby!
Hey! Grand Hustle, nigga!
If I ain't the hottest nigga on the universe
I guess I'll have to do until he gets here, nigga!

[B.o.B:] Here I go!

[T.I.:] Hey Call me a lie, nigga! Yeah

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
I'm that nigga that you heard about by word of mouth
They probably say I change the music in the dirty south
Now that the word is out, the timing is perfect now
To take all of these hypocritical rumor and burn em down
If you observe the doubt, you'd see what they worried about
They say I sound like Dre when I'm rapping my verses now
Honestly, I could give a fuck what you're blurting out
Point, blank, I'm in the game rocking my jersey now
So jazz it to me or pay me no mind
Either way you're gonna be hearing me all of the time
Whether on Greg Street or 107.9
Or on your favorite rap blog on your favorite rap website
And if that ain't right show me straight to the judge
Just like Brian Nichols I ain't spitting nothing but slugs
Venemous blood in my veins, chemicals up in my brain
Yes I resemeble a criminal, B.o.Bizzle, you ain't fucking with mayn

[Break]

[Outro: T.I. (B.o.B)]
Okay, you got that (I'm gone, mayn
I kinda, I kinda feel like I got you, man)
Hehehe (I had to kinda show you up, man
I ain't really wanna make you look bad, really, honestly)
Ay, man, ay man that laughing, that laugh is natural
Because I'm literally amused by your sentiment
I mean if you really feel that, know what I'm sayin
That the likes of the second verse can even
Slighlty compare with the immaculence (Hahaha)
Then I must take a chuckle... Hahaha
You know what I'm saying, but never no mind
(We can have em blog about it)
Abosulutely, man, I'll let you guys be the judge
(You know you gonna do it anyway, fuck it)
B.o.B or T.I.P. Know what I'm saying, you be the judge, dog
(Which could be the better acronym for the song)
But you know what either way it's Grand Hustle!
Hahahaha (Ah-haha)

[Chorus: until fade]

[Verse 1]
Though you don't call anymore
I sit and wait in vain
I guess I'll rap on your door
Tap on your window pane
I wanna tell you, baby
Changes I've been going through, missing you, listen you
'Til you come back to me that's what I'm gonna do

[Verse 2]
Why did you have to decide
You had to set me free?
I'm gonna swallow my pride
And beg you to please, baby, please see me
I'm gonna walk by myself
Just to prove that my love is true, all for you, baby
'Til you come back to me that's what I'm gonna do

[Bridge]
Living for you, my dear
Is like living in a world of constant fear
Hear my plea
I've got to make you see that our love is dying

[Verse 3]
Although your phone you ignore
Somehow I must explain
I'll gonna rap on your door, tap on your window pane
I'm gonna camp by your steps
Until I get through to you
I got to change your view, baby
'Til you come back to me that's what I'm gonna do
'Til you come back to me that's what I'm gonna do
'Til you come back to me that's what I'm gonna do

[Outro]
I'll gonna rap on your door, tap on your window pane
Open up, baby
I'll gonna rap on your door, tap on your window pane
I'll gonna rap on your door, tap on your window pane
Chris Tucker: Oh man! Look at that girl, right there!
Goodness gracious! That girl fine, man!
Look at it, she just too fine! She know she fine too!
She is banging!
She's off the hook!
She looks good, you're right
Hey, I bet you, can't nobody get that girl
Chris, I can get her
You can't get that girl, Mike
I guarantee you can't get that girl!
Watch me get that girl
I bet you never-Neverland, you can't
I can get her
All right! Shomon, then. Shomon!
Watch

I don't think they're ready for this one

Darkchild
I like that
My life will never be the same
'Cause girl you came and changed
The way I walk
The way I talk
I cannot explain
These things I feel for you
But girl, you know it's true
Stay with me
Fulfill my dreams
And I'll be all you need

Feels so right
(Girl)
I've searched for the perfect love all my life
(All my life)
Feels like I
(Like I)
Have finally found a perfect love this time
(And I finally found)

Come on, girl

You rocked my world
You know you did
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine
You rocked my world
You know you did
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine
In time
I knew that love would bring
Such happiness to me
I tried to keep my sanity
I've waited patiently
Girl, you know it seems
My life is so complete
A love that's true because of you
Keep doing what you do
Think that I
Finally found the perfect love I've searched for all my life
(Searched for all my life)
Think I'd find
Such a perfect love that's awesomely so right

Girl
You rocked my world
You know you did
(Come on, come on, come on)
Everything I own I give
(You rock my world)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
(Girl)
Someone like you to call mine

You rocked my world
(You rock my world)
You know you did
(You rock my world)
And everything I own I give
(Girl)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
(Girl, girl)
Someone like you to call mine
You rocked my world
You know you did
And everything I own I give
(You rock my world)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine

You rocked my world
You know you did
And everything I own I give
(You rock my world)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine

And girl, I know that this is love
I felt the magic's all in the air
And girl, I'll never get enough
That's why I'll always have to have you here

You rocked my world
(You rock my world)
You know you did
Everything I own I give
(Look what you did to me, baby)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine
(You, you, you, you)
(You rock my world)

You rocked my world
You know you did
(I cannot explain)
And everything I own I give
('Cause you rock my world)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine
(You rock my world)

You rock my world
(You rocked my world, you know you did)
The way you talk to me
The way you're loving me
The way you give it to me
(You rocked my world, you know you did)
You rock my world
You rock my world
You rock my world
You rock my world
Come on, girl
Come on, girl
Baby, baby, baby
It's you and me
You and me
You and me
You rock my world
You rock my world
You rock my world
Darling, I'm so blue without you
I think about you the live-long day
When you ask me if I'm lonely
Then I only have this to say

You'll never know just how much I miss you
You'll never know just how much I care
And if I tried, I still couldn't hide my love for you
You ought to know, for haven't I told you so
A million or more times?

You went away and my heart went with you
I speak your name in my ev'ry prayer
If there is some other way to prove that I love you
I swear I don't know how
You'll never know if you don't know now

You'll never know just how much I miss you
You'll never know just how much I care
You said good-bye, no stars in the sky refuse to shine
Take it from me, it's no fun to be alone
With moonlight and memories
I can't live with you
But I can't live without you
I can't let you stay
Ooh but I can't live if you go away
I don't know just how it goes
All I know is I can't live with you

Yeah I'm having a hard time
I'm walking a fine line between hope and despair
You may think that I don't care
But I travelled a long road to get hold of my sorrow
I tried to catch a dream
But nothing's what it seems
Love is saying baby it's all right
When deep inside you're really petrified
Lover turns to hater
On this escalator

I can't live with you - yeah
But I can't live without you
I can't breathe if you stay
But I can't bear you to go away
I don't know what time it is
All I know is I can't live with you
We're stuck in a bad place
We're trapped in a rat race
And we can't escape
Maybe there's been some mistake
We're trying to make a high score
We're walking through a closed door
And nobody's winning
We're just sinning against ourselves
Hold on baby tell me it's all right
Anger's breaking from the hurt inside
Passions screaming hotter
Doin' what we gotta do - yeah

I can't live with you I can't live with you
I can't live I can't live
I can't I can't live with you
But baby I'll never ever leave you
I can't live with you
But I can't live without you
Cause I'm in love with you
Ooh and everything about you
I can't live with you
No I just can't live I just can't live
I can't live with you
Yeah and I can't live without you
Through the madness through the tears
We've still got each other
For a million years - yeah
Ooh yeah
Yeah - I can't live without you - yeah yeah
I can't live without you
Yeah yeah oh oh oh
I can't live without you x3
Oh oh I can't live without you baby baby baby
Without you
I can't live without you
Lay me, Lay-lay lay me
Lay-lay lay me
Lay-lay lay me
L-l-l-l-l-l-lay me, lay-lay lay me
Lay-lay lay me
Lay-lay, lay me down

I go weak, then get up
Sometimes my knees can barely hold me up
I'm no fool, but instead
You gotta walk a mile until you're outta my head

Going in/Go within, taste it up
Dig/Take a little bit and baby don't you give up
Can't your life/Get your life, give a damn
You gotta make a move and show me where we can stand

Lay me down in darkness
Tell me what you see
Love is where the heart is
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
(Come on)
Lay me down in darkness
Tell me what you see
Love is where the heart is
Show me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
(Come on)

Tell me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
Tell me I'm the one, tell me I'm the one that you need
Brian:
We have to get it out

Mike:
Accomplished. The accomplishment of this...

Al:
This- this can be another...uh. This could be considered a track. Brian?

Brian:
Not really, though. We don't wanna do that

Al:
I think it's beautiful

Brian:
This is a little intro, ya know, to the album. Okay, this is "Intro to the Album: Take 1", and uh, we're gonna definitely need a C#

Al:
Brian, direct, okay?
Brian:
Alright. Let's try to really pull it off good now. Here we go. Three, four...

[Our Prayer: Take 1]

Brian:
Take it again. Once again. One minute, Mike. Not enough breath. Take it from the top of the second verse

Al:
And then what after that, Brian? What do we just do?

Brian:
And then it goes...

[sings]

Al:
That's the end, right? Great. And then the hum

Brian:
Okay, take it from the top of the second verse where you go down and you can... Three, four...

[Our Prayer: Take 2]

Brian:
That one note has to be a little smoother comin' up, Mike. Deeper breaths, here we go. Is this opened all the way around, Jim? That's weird that we're not picking up Mike in it

Mike:

[Sings] This is now goin' all around. Shake it up, shake it up, so we'll hear the sound!
Jim Hockman:

Carl:
Yeah, very close

Brian:
Hey, what's the matter with the notes? A whole note up, Mike

Al:
What's the chord? What's the key?

Brian:
It's... What're you doin' on the bottom, Mike?
Mike:

[Sings his part]

Brian:
Here we go. Three, four...

[Our Prayer: Take 4]

Al:
Get right in there

You want all of us, now?

Al:

Al:

Mike:
Let's go

Brian:
Three, four...

[Our Prayer: Take 5]

[Verse 1]
Everybody's lazy when they're tired
'Cause everybody's sucking on fluoride
And everybody's filing into line
'Cause everybody's sucking on fluoride

[Refrain]
When I'm in your mind
Then I'm in your mind

[Verse 2]
While everybody wants to suck you dry
And dig a little deeper in your mind - c'mon, deeper
Everybody's lazy 'cause they're fried
'Cause everybody's sucking on fluoride

[Refrain]
When I'm in your mind
Then I'm in your mind

[Refrain]
When I'm in your mind
Then I'm in your mind
I__come up hard, baby, but now I'm cool
I didn't make it baby, playin' by the rules
I've come of heart, baby, but now I'm fine
I'm checkin' trouble, sure movin' down the line
I__come up hard baby, but that's OK
'Cause Trouble Man don't get in my way

I___come up hard, baby
I've been for real, baby
Gonna keep movin', gonna roll to town
I___come up hard, I come up, getting down
There's only 3 things for sure:
Taxes, death and trouble

This I know, baby, this I know, child
Yeah, let the sweat through you, baby
Get me singin', yeah, yeah, ooo

I __come up hard, baby, I had to fight
Took care of business with all my might
I__come up hard, I had to win
Then start all over and win again
I__come up hard, but that's OK
'Cause Trouble Man don't get in my way
I've heard some places and I've seen some places
I've never had tensions, I give my directions
When people say; that's OK, they don't bother me
I'm ready to make it, don't care 'bout the weather
Don't care 'bout no trouble, got myself together
No laughin', no cryin', protection's all around me

I come up hard, baby
I've been for real, baby
With the Trouble Man
Movin', goin' tight
I__come hard, come up, get down
There's only 3 things for sure:
Taxes, death and trouble

This I know, baby, baby
This I know, baby, baby
Hey now, let it sweat, baby

I__come up hard, but now I'm cool
I didn't make it, baby, playin' by the rules
I__come up hard, baby, but now I'm fine
I'm checkin' trouble, sure movin' down the line
Go Timbo

I'll be the same when it all goes up, I'll be the same when it all goes down
Not the first one open it up, I'll be the last one closing it out
Don't know if I'll give you a shot yet, Lil Mama, I'm peeping your style
Do I think you're dope enough? Yup, one way of finding it out

The way you came at me, boo, don't care, not afraid, I'm like wild
Really want it from head to toe, question if she gon' let it out
Anyway the hour glass go, I don't worry anyhow
Why don't we see where it go? Let's figure it out

When the cats come out the bats come out to play, yeah
In the morning after
The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way, yeah
In the morning after

When the cats come out the bats come out to play, yeah
In the morning after
The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way, yeah
In the morning after dark
Come on, SoShy

I got a little secret for ya, I never sleep when comes the night
But every time I smack my fingers I switch back into the light
My moon belongs to your sun, your fire is burning my mind
Is it love or is it lust? Something that I just can't describe

Am I the one and only? 'Cause you're the only one
It felt so long and lonely, waiting for you to come
It's looking bright and early, I'm willing to close my eyes
This is the unusual story, Timbo and SoShy

When the cats come out the bats come out to play, yeah
In the morning after
The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way, yeah
In the morning after

When the cats come out the bats come out to play, yeah
In the morning after
The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way, yeah
In the morning after dark

Go Nelly

I need some REM but I don't like sleeping alone
So come and pick me up as soon as you put down the phone
I wanna get into trouble, later you'll carry me home
I wanna go undercover, I just wanna rattle your bones
Yes, I'm the one and only but I'm not the only one
So let's work overtime on this shift, it ends with the sun
Maybe we can start a riot, maybe we can run this town
Maybe I'll be your vampire, we could figure it out

When the cats come out the bats come out to play, yeah
In the morning after
The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way, yeah
In the morning after

When the cats come out the bats come out to play, yeah
In the morning after
The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way, yeah
In the morning after dark

Dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, in the morning after dark
Dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, in the morning after dark
Please don't leave me, girl, in the morning after dark
Please don't leave me, girl, in the morning after dark
Please don't leave me, girl

When the cats come out the bats come out to play
When the cats come out the bats come out to play
The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way

When the cats come out the bats come out to play
The dawn is here, be gone, be on your way
(Lil' Style)

Nine in the mornin, feds at my door (my door)
Lou Cortez creakin cross the hardwood floor (right)
Dippin thru the alley I made my escape
Didn't even get a chance to grab my Snoop Dogg tape
Man with no music but happy he's free
Bailin fast as I can bail down 19th Street
I got my sacks in my pocket and at least a grand
Gold on my knuckle, my pistol's closed in hand
I'm a Dogg Pound Gangsta from the LBC
Remotely controlled by the bomb-ity
But just livin in big city is a serious task
Didn't know what the feds wanted, didn't have time to ask

(Snoop Doggy Dogg)

We're comin with that G shit, that C shit that makin niggas sick
How does it feel to see a G from your clique?
Wake up, jumped out of bed wit my grin on (why?)
Last night's dice game got my win on
About a G and a half is what I come with
But twenty five G's is what I left with
*?Teatley?* was the word I heard
I went deep in my pockets and threw my stars on the cone
Gimme the dice so I can break you niggas
I threw a C (C-I-X) so my point was the biggie
Seven-four-four-tre back to back
I sent two fools back to their lizzack
(Kurupt)

See now I'm off to the graveyard shift
And I gots ta pay my dues to make my grip
But I chill cos my ho might call
Ain't no thang cos I sleeps all day and slang when night fall
And I takes a quick walk up the block
With my Glock cocke, ready to make a stop where I set up shop
On 59th and 8th Ave where all the homies be hangin
That's where a nigga'll be slangin
I'm makin a cool grip of shit, this ain't me
So I put my chips together and cops a quarter ki
And now the shops on deck
And everything that's mines I protect with a Tek, I don't half step
Now I got ends
And I'm rollin a Lexus, f**k a Benz, and so many new friends
But I could only trust a few
And unawarely I trusted you
But if only G

(Snoop)

It's Snoop, homies from the motherf**kin get-go
Devoted and quotin, back in '84
I was thirteen, G was a year older
But I still wadn't afraid to throw him from his shoulders
Gettin good on the hood was the anticipation
And yeah, King Park was the destination
Every nigga that I knew was at the Park that night
Even the smokers that be levellin gettin sparked tonight
(Lil' Style)

Back on the streets, straight blue and grey
Cos I represent like every day
Nigga you can't tell me I don't be on the spot
When I can tell you all the homies that done get shot
From at least about five years ago
When I was in junior high goin to Marshall
The homey use to come up to the school and rock
And leave and have the bitches flockin his jock
Damn them was the days of the past
But since the Pizzound formed we been whippin people's ass
And everybody a blast
And if you don't believe me nigga you can axe the homey Daz
And that's your ass
F**ked around and let Young Swoop take your cash (ha ha)
He didn't even run, he walked away (bust)
Cos I let it sit that day
I wished I was there I would've clowned
But that's why we axed your bitch ass from the Pound
Cos he wouldn't even squad back
Man we can't f**k with no niggas like that
He'll get us all cracked
If the police was behind us, he wouldn't even jump out with the strap
Now that's what I call a beeyatch! (Beeiyitch!)
I second the emotion you was dropped the clique (yeah yeah)
(Snoop)

Some of these nigga are bitches too
And some of these niggas look just like you
So if you've ever been *?toetone?*
Go out and get your roll on you punk ass nigga, you'll get stole on

(Dat Nigga Daz)

It's 5:30 in the mornin, now I'm yizzawnin
Now as I perceive to get G to a tee
And before I bail to school you know I blaze up a sack
Another day, another dollar for the gangsta mack
Bitch act like you know, show me some sex and affection
And let me dial slow, flossin, tossin a bitch (bitch)
Yeah Dogg, one more thing I forgot to mention
Shoot five niggas, shoot ten
Shoot the piece, slip to your fiends
Seven, goddamn it, when it deal
A '64 for the honeys, straight ho for the G
Young Daz, little nigga you can't f**k with me

(Snoop)

Now I knew that them niggas couldn't get at you
So what made them niggas try to spit at you
Disrespect a gang that snitch on you
Y'all punk ass niggas, man y'all some bitches too

(Young Swoop)

Who got some gangsta gangsta shit? (ha ha)
Swoop G, I heard somebody's speakin up on you
Cos when I drop mines there was no more nickels and dimes
Just quarters, ounces, half ounces and quota
PC is the season and I don't smoke blunt
It sees the indo with skunk, I might as well get drunk
To smoke some stress, that shit'll put a hole in your chest
I only want another twenty dollar, sure got me f**ked up
My hood is gettin hot and niggas is tryin ta plottin
Come up off a young nigga, call his shots
Swoop G ain't the one, I do its to be done (aah)
Al-ways have my gun and my G from 2-1
It's Cerritos but you don't hear me though cos you don't really know
About the you-know, I'm Cerritos, silly ho
Swoop G by the f**kin L-B's-C
None of these nigga wanna f**k with these (aah)
Swoop G, Swoop G, G
I can hear your singing, say you'll stay beside me
Why must it be, you'll always be into my dreams, hey hey

Mmm, oh-oh-oh, huggin' and sqeezing, huggin' and sqeezing
Why must it be you're always creepin'
Into my dreams -my, my, my dreams

When I sleep at night, baby, I feel these moments of ecstasy
And when you sleep at night, baby
I wonder do I creep into your dreams
Or could it be I sleep alone in my fantasy

Oh, love is so amazing, guess you will be stayin'
So let it be, you'll always be into my my sho' nuff dreams

But nighttime is my right time dream
Yeah, yeah, my, my, my, my dreamin'
I can see you walking down the street
You don't have to walk to creep into my sho 'nuff dreams
Yeah, drea-ea-ea-eams, yeah
Oh, into my dreams, nithtime is the time
Yeah, my dreams, yeah into my dreams
My, my, my, my, ah-ha, into my dreams
Say it to me four times
Whoah-hey, whoah-hey
Whoah-hey, whoah-hey

[Jadakiss]
I’m as real as they come, I follow the rules
I’m still in the hood but I probably should move
Made enough money, I don’t fuck around
I just felt they needed me, so I stuck around
Feds got my man, shit is real son
Cause my god son just became my real son
Think life is a game but all you get is a turn
You live and you learn, either you freeze or you burn
Kush in the air, I’m pushing the gears
Love turned into hate, hate turned into fear
If it ain't right, I don’t sign the deal
Shoot me in the watch, I got time to kill
Gasoline, propane, ain't no salary cap in the dope game
Ain't no collective bargaining on cocaine
So in other words nigga, do your thing

[Drake]
Mind in one place, heart in another
Please pardon my brother
He’s just angry at you niggas who dont have your heart in your rap shit
And got too f-ckin comfy, cause we still f-ckin hungry
Young Money, got the munchies
Faded, f-ckin faded, aww yeah im f-ckin faded
They tellin’ lies about me, aww yeah I must’ve made it
Rikers Island on this flow, 8 months for that pistol
But at least they had some bad bitches workin’ in that shit hole
Ahhh, 3 visits later, I went and did it major
So fuck the judge, and the jury, and the litigator
Watchin all these kids who thought they had it figured out
And then November came, they let my nigga out

[Lil Wayne]
Stop playin, I ain't with that bullshit
Niggas act like bitches. Shanaynay, oh my goodness
This is Wayne’s World, and y’all are just some tourists
Give me three wishes, I wish, I wish, I wish, you would bitch
Brand new pussy, pussy good as baby powder
Two Glock 40′s, nigga you got 80 problems
Swimmin’ in the money, Imma need some f-ckin goggles
Its better to give, but we dont give a fuck about ‘em
I just came home, shit then got real hoe
Lil Weezy-ana, the boot nigga, steal toe
I ain't workin with a full deck but I deal hoe
I just touched down, kick the motherf-ckin field goal
Talkin ’bout baby money? I got your baby money
Kidnap your bitch, get that ‘how much you love your lady’ money
I know you fake nigga, press your brakes nigga
I’ll take you out, that’s a date nigga
Im a grown ass blood, stop playin with me
Play asshole and get an ass whippin’
I think you pussy cat ha, hello kitty
I just throw the alley-oop to Drake Griffin
I lay em down, tempur-pedic
This shits a game of chess, you niggas think its cleavage
Its young money, yeah ’tis the season
I give you the business, bitch this a business meeting
My niggas hungry, my bitches greedy
Will I die a bloody murder? Dear Mr. Ouija
Nigga, Im straight, my girl a faggot
Potato on the barrel, pop pop tater salad

I've got a mind of my own
Why don't you think the same as me I used to talk to other people
They just put me in misery

Now the same thing happens, when
Nobody talks to you…
You sit around for hours and you
Don't know what to do…"

So tell me, why don't you think the same as me
I used to talk to other people
They just put me in misery

Break

I've got a mind of my own
I've got a mind of my own
I've got a mind of my own
I've got a mind of my own
Yes, I've got a mind of my own, baby
Why don't you think the same as me

[Intro: Ice-T]
Suckers step back, react to his attack
Evil E's in the place, cold doggin' the wax!

[Dave Storrs]
WORD!! WORD!!

[Verse 1: Ice-T]
All punks grab for your mothers, today's the day
I'm here to say warriors come out and play
Rhyme for your lives, weak run and hide
My name is Ice-T, L.A.'s where I reside
Fly as a bird, also awesome we've heard
If you bite I'll take your life best believe that's word
FBI's most wanted, but them suckers can't stop me
Mean rapping mother, terrorizing Qaddafi
Few tried to match the def raps I wrote
Dis my rhyme that's the time, razor meets your throat
Born in New Jersey but raised in L.A
Streets just as hard and the player's still play
Far from a fag, getting paid for my brag
So if you wanna come and battle bring a body bag
Definitely deadly and that ain't no jive
And if you don't like what I'm saying, we can take it outside
'Cause ain't nothin' like a squabble 'cause you know I'ms fine
And if knife be your reason, then Uzi be mine
So all punks get ill 'cause you know I'm gonna
Rhymes that ignite bite like a piranha
Ice-T's just rockin' the tracks
And Evil E's in the place, just doggin' the wax!

[Chorus: DJ Flash scratches quotes below]
Cold rockin' it...
When it's time to get ill..
Get ill!

[Verse 2: Ice-T]
I love the ladies who were down with the T
But what I hate and I state is a fool MC
You wanna battle the Ice, you gotta be insane
One step toward my rep, and I inflict the pain
Got so many raps, I got no place to store 'em
Got so many damn pages, I can wallpaper the Forum
Assassination, is my solution
No light abrasions, just massive contusions
Def dealing rhymer with a lust for blood
Conflict with the master and your name is mud
Kickin' up no mercy for the fact you're brave
I'll just bury your butt, then I'll spit on your grave
Laugh at your family as they stand and cry
Cold smack your mother all in the eye
'Cause I'll never get to heaven but you know damn well
I'll wear Bermuda shorts while I'm maxin' in hell
So all suckers step back, react to this attack
Don't try to write me off as talking lightweight smack
Because I'll leave you in shamble, I hustle don't gamble
And I'll rock your butt blind like HBO scramble
Doggin' the wax!
"Warning. The surgeon general of Chilltown, New York has determined that the sounds you're about to hear, can be devastating to your ear"

[Verse 3: Ice-T]
Sharp as a razor, down as dirt
Rhyme is my life, party is my work
L.A. is my place, Mirage is my base
So my lyrics make sense, no words I waste
Down for a duel, colder than Kool
Chill with the brothers who built the old school
Rhyme like a rocket, smooth in the pocket
Program the 808 and just lock it
Crash the studio with my crew, twenty four tracks mixed down to two
Jam hits the stores, pack concert floors
Freaks in my hotel room by the scores
This MC Ice-T, I rock the freaks to ecstasy
Take them to the T-O-P and bust them out officially
Never off, always on, rockin' to the break of dawn
Like this, like that, an MC that's not the wack
All rappers in the game, recognize my name
They write me off as bein' lame, or get me credit for my fame
I'm here to make it clear, '86 is my year
I'm the rapper you should fear, I will have no peer
Supreme MC Chief, and when I die in my belief
Battle from L.A. to Rome, rock beyond the Thunderdome
Sound hard, know why? It is, don't try
Only the top MCs will master this ability
If you do, you'll find out with the missed word, bit lip
Or run out of the air you need for high speed poetry
Take advice from Ice-T, leave the cuts to Evil E
Get a girl, feel the bass, rock her at this funky pace, ah!

[Break: DJ Flash displaying Old School turntablizm skills]

[Verse 4: Ice-T]
Dialing M for murder, flyin' MC's heads
Showing no remorse, reanimatin' the dead
Kicking dirt in your wounds, turning a wheel on the rack
I'll make you run for the hills with a streak up your back!
My rhymes are my pigeons, style cooler than cold
Voice always convincing, jewelry solid gold
Magnified finesse, a Hollywood address
The perpetrator, cremator, representing the West
Revenge is my best friend, homicide is my life
I write my rhymes in my book with blood on the knife
Never been beaten in life, never plan to be either
Rock two days straight before I take a breather
Rhymes, memorize 'em, locked inside my head
And anyone who dare bite somehow ends up dead
Got a license to kill, those refusing to chill
Uncut violence, my true thrill
I'm a hitman connoisseur, suckers talkin' manure
With cold commando tactics, no man can endure
Not to be mistaken, when MCs fakin'
All contracts issued to Ice-T are taken
With the most direct route, you have no chance to shout
With the silence of a ninja, your lights are out
Girls cry on sight, some ill out n' fight
For the post positions at my jam each night
The player from L.A., cooler than any "J"!
My name is Ice-T, I make the mafia pay!
Doggin' the wax!

[Outro: James Brown]
Not bad y'all!
Not bad at all!
Why do birds suddenly appear?
Every time you are near
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you, you, you

Why do stars come falling from the sky?
Every time you walk by
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born, the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair
Of gold and starlight in your eyes of blue

That is why all the boys in town
Follow you all around, yeah
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born, the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair
Of gold and starlight in your eyes of blue
That is why all the boys in town
Follow you all around, yeah
Just like me, they long to be, oh
Close to you, close to you

Oh, close to you
Oh, close to you

[Repeat and fade out]

[Verse 1]
Who is to say you'll be livin' in sadness
Hope you feel better Jove
Now's not the time to give in to the madness
Hope you feel better love, better love

[Verse 2]
Thought you were sharin' and found you were takin'
Hope you find better love
Try it on me and there'll be no forsaken
Gotta find better love, better love

[Bridge]
Hope you feel better love, girl
Hope you find better love
Hope you feel better love, girl
Better than before

[Verse 3]
Runnin' away you gave in to deceivin'
Hope you find better love
When you find out it was for the wrong reason
Hope you find better love, better love

[Outro]
I hope you feel better love
Find it, baby
I hope you find it
I hope you feel better love
Find it, find it, baby, find better love

[Guitar solo]
Well they're building a gallows outside my cell
And I've got 25 minutes to go
And the whole town's waitin' just to hear me yell
I got 24 minutes to go
Well they gave me some beans for my last meal
With 23 minutes to go
But nobody asked me how I feel
I got 22 minutes to go
Well I sent for the governor and the whole dern bunch
With 21 minutes to go
And I sent for the mayor but he's out to lunch
I've got 20 more minutes to go
Then the sheriff said boy I gonna watch you die
With 19 minutes to go
So I laughed in his face and I spit in his eye
With 18 minutes to go
Now hear comes the preacher for to save my soul
With 13 minutes to go
And he's talking bout' burnin' but I'm so cold
12 more minutes to go
Well they're testin' the trap and it chills my spine
11 more minutes to go
And the trap and the rope aw they work just fine
10 more minutes to go
Well I'm waitin' for the pardon that'll set me free
With 9 more minutes to go
But this ain't the movies so forget about me
8 more minutes to go
With my feet on the trap and my head on the noose
5 more minutes to go
Won't somebody come and cut me loose
7 more minutes to go
I can see the mountains I can see the skies
With 3 more minutes to go
And it's to dern pretty for a man that don't want to die
2 more minutes to go
I can see the buzzards I can hear the crows
1 more minute to go
And now I'm swingin' and here I go!
Thank you very much. I'm going to do another song here
Featuring the harmonica, eh
And then I want to get the stool there and sit down and do some, uh
Slow ballad type songs that we wanted to do for this album
And especially for you
What I do with my list over there. My idiot sheet
Oh, hit the floor
How ya doing Shirley?

Yo yo brand new KRS y'all, Maximum Strength
5 Boroughs of death we rep to death
Yo Kris, set it for The Bronx..

[KRS-One]
We hit em and get em, we stick em and jig em
We pick em and kick em
Flippin them whip and I'm wing-clippin them lip
Cause I'm cold sick of them
Much quicker than them lyrically trickin and my Tribe
Be on a Quest like Tip and them
On every avenue puttin the full clip in em
Splittin and strippin em down while spittin a round
Into them soundclash see winnin them, just begginin them
Get rid of ev-ery bit of them with them negative idioms
I don't even consider them
In the new millenium we killin them
Breeze Deep, Kenny and Will and them, KRS-One we thrillin em
Many battles we been in them now we rebuildin them
We blaze, fulfillin them, Keith ?, Jesse, Jamil and them
We originate styles, other be stealin them

[Vigilante]
You got a good rise in your rolodex, who flow is next?
Comin out to {fuck} with the best, put it in your chest
Inhale it and hold that, blow it out when I say let go; let's see
If you can hold your breath, by the time I flip to the next flow
This sho' is real, this is the deal, guns I'm runnin
Gotta make it out of town to flip my {shit} and keep it comin
Then bring it back, with another stack, of raps to blow your back out
How many of y'all wanna go for yours I keep my dogs in the crackhouse

[Buckshot]
Let's take a walk through Crown Heights
Steppin through the city at night, with the ? and two mic
Form a little lynch mob, and stomp through the five boroughs
Head back to Brooklyn in the Expo
Back on the block, I see the cops everybody clockin
Buckshot, when you see the rocks, me I got you shocked
Why not? You see the recipe
Buckshot, I represent Brooklyn and my {nigga} Biggie

[Keith Murray]
I'm from C-I, L-I, F-L-Y
Where the {niggas} and the {bitches} stay paid fly and high
Where a slut'll get mad if you call her a {bitch}
And a rat'll get mad if you call her a snitch
Where the rich emerge, with the {niggas} from the ditch
And it's a myth, they get {niggas} from the suburbs, that's herbs
Yo this is for my {niggas} on the block all day
Who don't give a {fuck} waitin for crime to pay
Put your money on it, yo we never fronted
Long Island got some of the best {niggas} that ever done it
From Riverhead to C.I. to Brentwood to Wyndanch
{Niggas} comin through will not stand a chance
From Roosevelt to Freeport to Hempstead to Uniondale
Comin deep from the depths of hell
I'm dead serious, even though you see me smilin
Rough enough to break New York from Long Island

[Cam'Ron]
We destroy {niggas}, need advice, cause I heard em sayin Jesus Christ
You should see the sight, cookin ox-tail, peas and rice
Makin about a G a night, they can't read or write
But I got every creed and type, you need a dyke, babygirl I see the light
But sometime y'all get crimey crimey, grimy grimy
But those with a tiny hiney they get whiny whiny
So guard your girl, Harlem World, cock the gun, pop it son
Fila fam, illa players, Killa Cam is still the man

[Bounty Killer]
Uptown massive, Uptown the borough
Uptown let the ? kali, no sorrow
Uptown trestle, Uptown of course
I grab you ? they got me turn up to North
And if dem turn up North ? hurt no tell de boss
And if dem tell me off dey are a bunch of ghosts
And if dem gal are up, well den dem know da gal are boss
De rap dancehall try on de Mossinos
And if dem tie me off, dem can call me Cedro
I put a rap to singalong in all de ? crew
And if da gal a bitch ? ? the rainbow
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

[Killah Priest]
Yo, hit you with the force of an iron horse
Tear your face off the planet, leavin one-third damaged
Witcha back cracked the earth canvas, leavin mountains slanted
Rock the earth of the axle, crabs who
Polar bears beneath the sea gravel
Thoughts be runnin wild like the Lil' Rascals
Puttin dinosaurs inside of figure fours, rip you with nine inch claws
Chasin {motherfuckers} through malls, and clash in halls
Beatin {motherfuckers} through walls, stompin through floors
And jumpin down elevator shafts
Searchin for they {ass}, stayin low in the grass
Wearin a gas mask, wrappin their hands up in plastic bags
On stage like a savage goin mad
WHAT? Yeah yeah, sooooooooooooo!

[Prodigy]
Yeah, by all means you know you gotta put Queens on it
Put cream on it, Q.B. we rep often
Take over your party, slamdance witcha hood
Took your ladies back to the projects with us
Then sent her {ass} back on the Q-train home
Satisfied, she learned the words to my thug song
See we one big borough of Dons with firearms
And we never use those, til the man act
Other than he's 'sposed to, {nigga} what I'm 'sposed to do?
Shots whistle, damn near missed dat
Shoes get pissed at

[Redman]
From the, tip of my Timbs, to my eyebrows
The hostile, english, Olde E widemouth
Get PCP fiends, jumpin off cliffs
And if you had the balls, you'd be walkin off stiff
My paragraph alone is worth five mics (uh-huh)
A twelve song LP, that's thirty-six mics (uh-huh)
And while you win Un Hype (uh-huh) I spit on your snipe
And tell you {fuck you} and that {bitch} on your bike
Brick City!!

[Reverand Run]
Aiyyo.. now bust it
Never try me crimey I'm grimy so don't deny me
I be Little like your Rascals and stymie to fly that hiney
Buy me keys, to my Benz and my Coupe
Like Jay and Run and D.M.C.'s, that's the name of my group
(now speed it up)
Beat to the rhythm of the rhyme
I'm givin up a dime, there go another line you figured
Never drivin by nine, never givin up a dime if you was
Never been that {nigga}
If you really wanna test me, brother don't stress me
Or you just be bowlin
It's Reverand like a Jesse, brother that's just me
And that's just my colon

The five boroughs of death, we rep to death
Step aside little {niggas}, show time yep
It's goin down the moment we inside the spot
Let's rock'n'roll, you know the M.O., it gets real
When the five boroughs of death, we rep to death
Step aside little {niggas}, show time yep
It's goin down the moment we inside the spot
Let's rock'n'roll, you know the M.O., it gets hot

Remember those walls I built
Well baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I've got my angel now
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out
Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
Woah...
Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like fallin'
Gravity can't forget
To pull me back to the ground again
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you breakin'
The risk that I'm takin'
I'm never gonna shut you out
Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see you halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
Halooooo ouuuu
Halooooo ouuuu
Halooooo ouuuu
Ouuuuu ouuuuu ouuuuu
Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see you halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over you face
Baby I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
I can feel your halo, halo, halo
I can see your halo, halo, halo
Oohhhh...

You and me left alone at night
We can hold each other
I want you and me left alone at night

Hey, get on the ground

I've been watching you
You've been hurting too

Nothing left to show
I have been there too
Alone in my despair
Watching life go by
No one who to share
Boy you got it bad
But I got something good
I want you good in every way yeah
You will never feel alone
My touch is such a rush
It over flows

Chorus:
I will give to you the love you seek
And more
So what are you waiting for

Baby here we are
Standing face to face

Locked in your embrace
Now i got it bad
But you got something good
Won't you treat me good
In every way

And your love
It over flows
I will give to you the love you seek and more
So what are you waiting for

X2
I said look, how can I live?
With so much anger barbecuing in my ribs? Within
Hashed it, came back shake
Cleaned up my closet, came back to a grave
Guess I'm workin' this shift, for landin' in the same car
Aha, went jump cliff, stiff arm to what is
What you think? That I don't?
Then fuck you, to what if?
I do life, go so slow
Huh, till the beat don't beat
Then it was Too Short, like Jesus please
I do anything for a kiss and a hug
And I give up my advice to hear you speak again

Come back baby, don't you cry
Don't you drain those big blue eyes
I've been crawlin'

What ya thank? I can see you cried a river
Eye dollars running on the soil, how you not remember?
Got myself a hoe you cannot get into
Now you got in it-in it when I released the tension
Smackin' and grabbin' the grave stones of our memories happen
And the lame ones give opinions, I'm laughin'
The same ones, they ain't shit to me, that's it
Flash dicks with a ass kick
I said habits never lasted
I said that's it, black magic
I said passed it, told you, that's it!
I said flash dicks, with a ass-kick
I said habit never lasted
I said that's it, black magic
I said passed it, told you
That's it, that's it, that's it!
Come back baby, don't you cry
Just you say the reason why
I keep calling you
Led astray before the fragile defense of words
Come and stay, bring the stars
Play in the milky night
Led astray before the fragile defense of words
Come and stay, bring the stars
Play in the milky night
Led astray before the fragile defense of words
Come and stay, bring the stars
Play in the milky night
Led astray before the fragile defense of words
Come and stay, bring the stars
Play in the milky night
Give it to mama
Give it, give it
Give it to mama, mama
Give it
Give it to mama, mama
For some strange reason
You done pleasin' me like it's okay
Like a perm that's been left too long
It's starts to burn, the result is it just won't take
(I can see)
Now it's all coming so clear to me now
(I can see)
Misinterpreted all my naiveness
Was just thinking if I had no you than I can't do
My stock just went up over 2 million
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
Give it to mama
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, red light, green light
Some see me say I should be trophied
'Cause it gets no stronger
Ladies y'all know, yeah, girl y'all know
This pimp *ish gets no older
Is that a threat? What's another threat?
Yep, that's another threat, from you, you can get no colder
You got the green light, you lookin' right
You holdin' up traffic, green means go!
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, red light, green light
(I said you're holdin' up traffic, green means go!)
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
Give it to mama
(Go, go, go, go)
Ain't no problem, you can go
I'm gon' find somebody else
(Go, go, go, go)
So why not move along?
You got the green light so you can go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, red light, green light
I gave all I could give
To my love, my heart
Now we're facing the end
Of what you did from the start, my love
You're holdin' up traffic, green means go!
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
So if you want to, you got the green light
Give it to mama
(Go, go, go, go)
Ain't no problem, you can go
I'm gon' find somebody else
(Go, go, go, go)
So why not move along?
You got the green light so you can go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, red light, green light
Tell me just what I should be expecting
Cause here I am on my own free will
Fortune favors the brave
So they say

I might as well fix something, play your game
Make the memory the reason
Remembering the time when you and I felt the high
I've found a way to justify

And we cannot replay
Give the aesthetical feel
We had our brighter day
Was it synthetic or real?

I'll protect the memory
If baby you can't recall it
You can't recall that
22nd January
If baby you can't recall it
I won't forget that
Was it just as real as you expected?
Does looking back give you a chill?
Show me something you prefer today
Yeah yeah
Or maybe you're grown up and down to say
That amnesia gave you freedom
Or maybe you're the kind that tells a lie just to lie
I never have to say goodbye

And we cannot replay
Give the aesthetical feel
We had our brighter day
Was it synthetic or real?

I'll suspend your disbelief
Puttin faith in your relief
I suspect your disbelief
Puttin faith in your relief
I'll suspend your disbelief
Puttin faith in your relief
I'll suspend your disbelief

I protect the memory
If baby you can't recall it
You can't recall that
22nd January
If baby you can't recall it
I won't forget that
Slay, vampire
Old vampires
Like to see youth suffer
A vampire
Only trod upon creation
Unno set of vampires
The younger generation
(Mid)night, and now humble when it's daylight
Oh...
Old vampires
Only like to see blood running
Make sure you know it's fire burning
(fire bun, fire bun)
Unno old vampires
Only...
Unno old vampires
Set of vampires
(Crea)tion
You fight against everything good for the younger generation
You bloody meditation
Unno set of vampires
Vampires
Doing wickedness at midnight
And...
Fire bun !
Unno old vampires
Unno old vampires
Unno old vampires
Outequity worker (Vampire)
Unno old vampires
Unno old vampires

Time after time, you been copping mine
Like, "Can I have a good time at yours tonight?"
'Cause every time we try to get close
There is always something that I'm thinking about

[Pre-Chorus: M.I.A.]

You want me be somebody who I'm really not
You want me be somebody who I'm really not

[Verse 2: M.I.A.]
A knock at the door, and then we hit the floor

XXXO
Y'all just so metrosexual
This is not my political correct flow
This is more like letting that TEC blow
This is more like a left when they say right
When the world do you wrong but you play right
This is more like pushing that white rock
When the world try to put you in a tight box
Coming up in the drop with the system bang
'Cause you don't give a fuck what the system think
Y'all comin up M.I.—M.I.—M.I.A
Semi-spray when you in my way
I'mma be who I'm gonna be
I'm just a boy from the hood
What you want from me?
Ugh

[Interlude: M.I.A.]

[Verse 1]
The last time I saw her
She didn’t have anything to say, that hurt
Time has a funny way of turning things around
Doesn’t anything last?

[Verse 2]
Not so long ago that you loved me
She tried but she couldn’t understand, oh, no
Time has a funny way of turning down a man
Doesn’t anything last?
Drunk girls
Drunk girls
Drunk girls
Drunk girls

(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls have a couple of heart attacks
(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls are unusually mild but
(Drunk boys)
Drunk boys keep in pace with the pedophiles
(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls are boringly wild

(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls get invitations from nations
(Drunk girls)
They got the patience of a millions of saints but
(Drunk boys)
Drunk boys, we work with the cupboards
(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls like to file complaints
(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls would like a night of simplicity
(Drunk girls)
They need a lover who is smarter than me but
(Drunk boys)
Drunk boys, we walk like pedestrians and
(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls wait an hour to pee

(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls know that love is an astronaut
(Drunk girls)
It comes back, but its never the same but
(Drunk boys)
Drunk boys, drunk boys, drunk boys, drunk boys
(Drunk girls)
Drunk girls can be just as insane

But oh oh oh
I believe in waking up together
So oh oh
That means making eyes across the room

Mr. David Scott Stone
(Drunk girls)
Just cause I'm shallow doesn't mean that I'm heartless
(Drunk girls)
Just cause I'm heartless doesn't mean that I'm mean
(Drunk boys)
Sometimes love gives us too many options
(Drunk girls)
Just 'cause you're hungry doesn't mean that you're lean
(Drunk girls)
I've heard lies that could curdle your heartstrings
(Drunk girls)
A couple truths, maybe burn out your eyes but
(Drunk boys)
Drunk boys keep the irons in the fireplace
(Drunk girls)
'Cause drunk girls give them too many tries

Drunk girls, drunk girls, drunk girls, drunk girls
Drunk girls, drunk girls, drunk girls, drunk girls
Drunk girls, drunk girls, drunk girls, drunk girls
Drunk girls, drunk girls, drunk girls, drunk

Oh oh oh
I believe in waking up together
So oh oh
I believe in waking up, but no promises
Oh oh oh
I believe in waiting out the weather
So oh oh
I believe in making up

And gaze across the room
Oh oh oh
I believe in waking up together
Oh oh oh
I believe in waking up together
Oh oh oh
I believe in waking up together
The day becomes the night
Honestly, honestly, honestly
Unless it hurts, why do it?
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Oh
Remember this?
Remember Bob Gibson?

Tell old Bill, when he comes home this morning
Tell old Bill, when he comes home this evening
Tell old Bill, when he comes home
To leave them down-town girls alone
This morning, this evening, so soon

Old Sal was baking bread this morning
Old Sal was baking bread this evening
Old Sal was baking bread
When she found out that her Bill was dead
This morning, this evening, so soon

She said “Oh no, it can’t be so”, this morning
“Oh no, it can’t be so”, this evening
She said “Oh no, it can’t be so
My Bill left home about an hour ago”
This morning, this evening, so soon
Well they brought Bill home in a hurry-up wagon this morning
They brought Bill home in a hurry-up wagon this evening
Well you know they brought Bill home in a hurry-up wagon
His arms, his legs, his feet were dragging
This morning, this evening, so soon
So soon, so soon, so soon

Tell old Bill, when he comes home this morning
Tell old Bill, when he comes home this evening
Tell old Bill, when he comes home
To leave them down-town girls alone
This morning, this evening, so soon
So soon, so soon
Even a bird would want a taste of dirt from abyssal dark
The prick of a feather could make a kingdom burn and the bloodshed start
The falling apart
Why'd you cut holes in the face of the moon base?
Don't you know about the temperature change
In the cold black shadow?
Are you mad at your walls
Or hoping that an unknown force can repair things for you?
Pardon all the time that you've thrown into your pale grey garden?
If the ship will never come you've got to move along
Even a bird would want a taste of dirt from abyssal dark
The prick of a feather could make a kingdom burn and the bloodshed start
The falling apart
Made me a shadow in the shape of wonder
The waves of black
If she's going under I can hold my breath till the sky comes back
Even a bird would want a taste of dirt from abyssal dark
The prick of a feather could make a kingdom burn and the bloodshed start
The falling apart
Made me a shadow in the shape of wonder
The waves of black
If she's going under I can hold my breath till the sky comes back
Or drown like a rat
The falling apart
The falling apart
The falling apart
It will inspire on the burning pyre
Half the distance
Half the motion
It will inspire on the burning pyre
Half the distance
Half the motion
It's easy as the ocean
Even a bird would want a taste of dirt from abyssal dark
The prick of a feather could make a kingdom burn and the bloodshed start
The falling apart
Made me a shadow in the shape of wonder
The waves of black
If she's going under I can hold my breath till the sky comes back
Or drown like a rat
The falling apart
The falling apart
The falling apart

[Verse 1]
What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawin' me in and you kickin' me out
You've got my head spinnin', no kiddin'
I can't pin you down
What's goin' on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright

[Pre-Chorus]
My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

[Chorus]
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
How many times do I have to tell you?
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down, I'm around
Through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing
In my head for you

[Pre-Chorus]
My head's under water, but I'm breathin' fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

[Chorus]
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh

[Bridge]
Give me all of you, oh
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it's hard

[Chorus]
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you

[Outro]
I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh
Eh yo Mary, I need you to vibe wit me on this one, uh
Uh

[Missy Elliot]
Check it
As I grab my pad and pen and begin to talk from within
Oh God I'm hot as the water like a preacher who's sinned
I'm only human but
The world has put me on a platform since the day I was born
To only wait for my downfall but like a brick wall im too hard to brake
OK I do make mistakes but I'm the realest from the fake
That's why I'm the hardest to hate
Aaliyah baby girl I've learned to love those while ther still awake
Sleep Sleep
And prepare a place for those who are good in the projects and hood
Give to those who are misunderstood
I know like Lisa, Pac and Biggie and Jay and Pun are still No1
There will be more of us to come
I am a leader a teacher I gotta, like a single parent provider
Put in back those hip hop dividers
Like a preist with a back slider
I've sinned ut I win
And anyone we've lost in life from 9-11
We'll be sure to see again

[Mary J. Blige]
What you hear is not a test, I'm rocking to the beat 

[Repeat: x2]
See me and my crew, and my friends were gonna try to move our feet
See I am Mary Blige and I'll like to say hello
To the black to the white, the red and the brown, the purple and yellow
First you gotta
First you gotta
Hi baby
I know you're under a lot of pressure at your work and all
And I do understand
You have no idea how much I understand
But you also don't have any idea how much I love you
I love you so much
I think about you I feel you in my arms
I miss you, I miss you terribly
I've just always wanted someone like you in my life
I love you so much that I'd do anything, I'd do anything
I'll be your perfect woman for you

I just wanna fuck bad bitches
All them nights I never had bitches
Now I'm all up in that ass bitches
Mad at your boyfriend, ain't 'cha?
You'se a bad girl, gotta spank ya
Gotta thank ya for that head clinic
Explicit, hella photogenic
And tell your friends where the dick's at
Where they can get hit and won't get back to they soulmate
Before you kiss 'em use Colgate
She swallowed it, yeah the bitch took the whole eight
And ran with it, then let Mel-Man hit it
And Hittman hit it, damn bitches
Man, this is what I'm talkin about
Chicken head, chicken fed with a dick in yo' mouth
Out and about with your nigga like it never took place
(Airtouched) Next time you need a taste
Devin the Dude:
I just wanna fuck you, no touching and rubbing girl
You've got a husband who loves you
Don't need you all in mine
I just wanna fuck you, we can't be kissing and hugging girl
You've got a husband who loves you
You need to give him your quality time

You got the number, it's on you to make the call
You know I come quick help you redecorate your walls
Cut your backyard, don’t have to act hard to get the cock
And if I'm going too far, I take it out and wipe it off
And put it back up, and keep going
You tryin to hide it from your husband but I know he be knowin
That your pussy's been tampered with
Did you show him the new trick of how you can make it smoke a cancer stick?
You be workin it like a dancer, bitch, it's hard on me
Not to give you all of my time that you wanted
You can give me some head, but keep the breakfast in bed
I'd rather spend my morning digging through some records instead
But, tonight I guess it'd be aight if we can touch bases
Hook up somewhere and exchange some Fuck Faces
I know your man's looking for ya, he's always trying to run ya
Don't worry bout me handcuffing girl 'cause I just wanna

Snoop Dogg:
Fuck witchu
On the sneak tip, on some creep shit
So whatcha gon' do, you freak bitch?
You acting like you don't do dicks
That's the kinda bitch I hate fuckin with
Baby was a virgin, that's what she said
So I gave her some Hennessy, she gave me some head
I fucked her on the floor so I wouldn't mess up my bed
Then Lil half-dead put his dick on her head
Take that bitch home and give her a bone
And give her the number to my cellular phone
Now she's blowing up my pager, the shit's gettin major
A favor for a favor, this dick is what I gave her
Something to go by and bitches know why
Stuff dick in they mouth and then I'm out (See-ya)
24/7, Dre, Snoop and Devin
We serving these hoes and never loving these hoes
Devin the Dude:
I just wanna fuck you, no touching and rubbing girl
You've got a husband who loves you
Don't need you all in mine
I just wanna fuck you, we can't be kissing and hugging girl
You've got a husband who loves you
You need to give him your quality time
Feet don't fail me now

I'm a run this city so feet don't fail me now
I never will stand still
I still run this here
Feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now

It's the rap thespian, trap champion
Dude never lose even when you think he can't even win
Again, don't nobody do it like the kid do
Talkin bout the greatest better throw him on the list too (who)
Way at the top even stopped dreamin even in the offseason I'm steamin (hot)
Hurry up somebody better check our temperature
On the fire titan like the movie they remember us
Plus how can a nigga hate for real when resilience the only thing matchin' my brilliance
Hahaha lol niggas kill me
Look mama no guns and I'm still G
Whoda thought from baker rows center hill he get so much accomplished niggas plot to try to kill me
And keep it real we try yet and still we die out in the battle field but don't nobody feel me
While these niggas run they mouth
I'm a run this city so feet don't fail me now
I never will stand still
I still run this here
Feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now

Yea, sign yours sincerely
I been up on my game, really they just started listening
So when you talk about the greats you got to mention me
And if you're smellin' dro you know that I'm in the vicinity
Flawless with symmetry
Yea, since elementary niggas bite the style like they tryna swap identities
Empty refrigerators all I see up in my memory
Now I'm in the club with complimentary Hennessy
But this a jungle so you hear the snakes slitherin'
These niggas fake like a face with no blemishes
So I'm movin' with the force of an olympian
So cold with it you would think that I invented it
Yea, I got a million ways to get it in
All day back and forth like tennis is
Another day at the office to handle business
From the beginning I sprinted knew where the finish is

While these niggas run they mouth
I'm a run this city so feet don't fail me now
I never will stand still
I still run this here
Feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now
I heard the tip I won't and shame on they ass
Since the presence is a gift I won't refrain from the past
I'm a young stunner focused and ready to smash
Niggas on that sucka shit boy they really appeared sad
If my feet don't fail me I shall be crowned
But they never failed me before why would they fail now
I'm the one to call on look how they kept it down
Hopin they got the right number I hear the skeptical sounds
I made they ass I'm made to last
Niggas thinking that they on fire I blaze they ass (I mean it)
I'm hopin you see it comparing me to rappers is silly
Them boys stale packin up illys
And all my niggas packin the illy my fraction is gritty we large
The best kush the only reason I'm beggin' your pardon
Cats don't know how to act in the presence of don's
I'm just bein a playa while they bitches enjoyin' my charm

While these niggas run they mouth
I'm a run this city so feet don't fail me now
I never will stand still
I still run this here
Feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now
I said feet don't fail me now

[Verse 1]
I'm surprised to see your suitcase at the door
(I'm surprised, I'm surprised)
Remember the good times, don't you want some more?
(Don't you want it?)
It's not a perfect love, but I'll defend it
(I'm surprised)
'Cause I believe that's what God intended

[Chorus]
We got love too good to throw away
It's not over between you and me
It's not over, don't want to be free
What has been joined by God, by God
Let no man put asunder
Oh no no, don't throw it away, don't throw it away, yeah

[Verse 2]
I can hear those words spoken as I stood
(Where I stood)
Making bonds through love, the times are better good
(Don't you want it?)
I'm convinced that what is meant to be will be
(It will be)
Even the stars declare that you belong to me

[Chorus]
We got love too good to throw away
It's not over between you and me
It's not over, don't want to be free
I don't wanna be free
What has been joined by God, by God
Let no man put asunder
Oh no, don't throw it away, don't throw it away, yeah

[Outro]
Hmm, oh oh, oh yeah
It's not over between you and me
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be free
It's not over, don't want to be free
It's not over between you and me
It's not over, no no
It's not over, don't want to be free
It's not over, oh oh oh
It's not over
I said, "I need you and I want you"
It's not over
I got to have you every day in my doggone life
It's not over
It's not over, no, no, no, no, no
It's not over
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
It's not over
Said, "I need you and I want you"

Baby, baby, baby, oh oh oh, mmm, mmm

I know you'll be coming back someday
Because I know deep inside you feel the same way
Because it's, it's not over, no

To know that I love you baby

Tell me how you love me more
And how you think I'm sexy baby
That you don't want nobody else
You don't want this guy, you don't want that guy, you wanna
Touch yourself when you see me
Tell me how you love my body
And how I make you feel, baby
You wanna roll with me, you wanna hold with me
You wanna stay warm and get out of the cold with me
I just love to hear you say it
It makes a man feel good, baby
Tell me you depend on me
I need to hear it

I'm lost without you
Can't help myself
How does it feel
To know that I love you baby
Baby you're the perfect shape
Baby you're the perfect weight
Treat me like my birthday

Tell me you don't want me to stop
Tell me it would break your heart
That you love me and all my dirty
You wanna roll with me, you wanna hold with me
You wanna make fires and get Norwegian wood with me
I just love to hear you say it
It makes a man feel good, baby

I'm lost without you
Can't help myself
How does it feel
To know that I love you baby

'cos you may tell me every morning
Oh, all right baby
Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
Well I'm stressin'
'Bout what I've been missing
And I feel it
Stressin' is an instinct
Stress, colors
All of my dreams orange
And I'm dreamin'
Stressin' is an instinct

[Refrain]
Now, I'm biting down on my jaw
Oh now, it's making all of my teeth sore

[Verse 2]
Safe travel
Walk into another

My partner
Is a clever lover
He told me
Stressin' is an instinct

[Refrain]
Now, I'm biting down on my jaw
Oh now, it's making all of my teeth sore

[Verse 1]
Well I'm stressin'
'Bout what I've been missing

[JACKIE ELLIOT/DAD]
Oh once I was a young man
Looked over vales and hills
Saw myself a future
Of riches and of thrills
But on me fifteenth birthday
I paid my union dues
And they sent me deep into the ground

Oh the winter wind can blow me colder
Oh the summer's heat can parch me dry
But I'll not leave here for a fortune
I shall never leave here till I die

Oh once I had a family
Sons to make you proud
They have gone and left me now
And I count the time out loud
For now, I am an old man
Just waiting for my turn
Till they take me back into the ground
Oh the winter wind can blow me colder
Oh the summer's heat can parch me dry
But I'll not leave here for a fortune
I shall never leave here till I die

Oh the winter wind can blow me colder
Oh the summer's heat can parch me dry
But I'll love these dark, dark hills forever
And I won't leave them until I die

Oh once I loved a woman
She meant all the world to me
Saw ourselves a future
As far as I could see
But I was only forty-seven
When they took her down from me
And buried her deep

[BILLY]
Oh the winter wind can blow me colder
Oh the summer's heat can parch me dry
But I'll love these dark, dark hills forever
And I won't leave them until I die

[Spoken BILLY]
Merry Christmas, Dad

[Spoken DAD]
Merry Christmas, Son
Well, they gave him his orders in Monroe, Virginian
Said, "Steve, you're way behind time
"This is not 38, this is Ol'97
"Put her into Spencer on time."
Then he turned around and said to his black, greasy fireman
"Shovel on a little more coal
And when we cross that White Oak mountain
"Watch Ol'97 roll."
And then a telegram come from Washington station
This is how it read
"Oh that brave engineer that run '97
"Is lyin' in Danville dead."
"Cause he was going down a grade making 90 miles an hour
The whistle broke into a scream
He was found in the wreck with his hand on the throttle
Scalded to death by the steam."
One more time!
Oh, now all you ladies you better take a warning
From this time on and learn
Never speak harsh to your true-lovin' husband
He may leave you and never return
Poor Boy
I want to thank you. Yeah, it's good to see you
Oh, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
Get a feeling that I never, never, never, never had before
No, no
I get a good feeling, yeah

Oho, sometimes I get a good feeling, yeah
Get a feeling that I never, never, never, never had before
No, no
I get a good feeling, yeah

Was down in Mississippi not so long ago
When a young boy from Chicago town
Walked in a Southern door
This boy's fateful tragedy
You all should remember well
The color of his skin was black
And his name was Emmett Till
Some men, they dragged him to a barn
And there they beat him up
They said they had a reason
But disremember what
They tortured him and did some things
Too evil to repeat
There were screaming sounds inside the barn
There was laughing sounds out on the street
Then they rolled his body down a gulf
Amidst a blood red rain
And they threw him in the waters wide
To cease his screaming pain
The reason that they killed him there
And I'm a-sure, it ain't no lie
'Cause he was born in black-skin barn
He was born to die
And then to stop the United States
Of yelling for a trial
Two brothers, they confessed
That they had killed poor Emmett Till
But on the jury there were men
Who had helped the brothers commit this awful crime
And so this trial was a mockery
But nobody there seemed to mind
I saw the morning papers
But I could not bear
To see smiling brothers
Walkin' down the courthouse stairs
For the jury found them innocent
And the brothers, they went free
While Emmett's body floats the foam
Of a Jim Crow southern sea
If you can't speak out against this kind of thing
A crime that's so unjust
Your eyes are filled with dead men's clay
Your ears must be filled with dust
Your arms and legs
They must be in shackles and chains
And your mind, it must cease to flow
For you to let our human race
Fall down so God-awful low
This song is just a reminder
To remind your fellow man
That this kind of thing still lives today
In that ghost-robed Ku Klux Klan
But if all of us folks that thinks alike
If we gave all we could give
We could make this great land of ours
A greater place to live
What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
You've got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
What's going on in that beautiful mind
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright

My head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh oh
How many times do I have to tell you
Even when you're crying you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you

My head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh oh

Give me all of you
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it's hard
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you

I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh oh
We need your love, to shower down
In our hearts, hear us now
We need some answers
I know you’re hurting, I hear you crying
But come tomorrow, there’s a place you can go
On the blue sky, hear the choir sing
Feel the power, of miracle
Healing both, you and me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

We need the world, call an angel
Show us a sign, let us know
Give us all, we’re ... You
To give us friends, to carry on
Help us up, and take us home now

I know you’re hurting, I hear you crying
But come tomorrow, there’s a place you can go
On the blue sky, hear the choir sing
Feel the power, of miracle
Healing both, you and me
I know you’re hurting, I hear you crying
But come tomorrow, there’s a place you can go
On the blue sky, hear the choir sing
Feel the power, of miracle
Healing both, you and me
I know you’re hurting, I hear you crying
But come tomorrow, there’s a place you can go
On the blue sky, hear the choir sing
Feel the power, of miracle
Healing both, know you’re worthy

J-Jungle Beats… holla at me
Grand Hustle Nigga… money

[Chorus]
You know me, I'm so fly
Be lookin like money every time I ride by
Got them Benjis in my pocket and money on my mind
If it ain't about no paper, then it ain't about I
Cause I get-get-get it, money I get
When I step up in the club, I be feelin like Mitch
When I be in the hood, I be ridin with your bitch
You know she prolly on my dick 'cause I'm prolly the shit

[Verse 1]
Listen, I'ma ball til I fall, spit it like I print it
Got shawty on the low 'cause I get-get-get it
Don’t worry 'bout it, I probably just hit it
I ain't stubborn with them hoes, you can have her back, nigga
I’m a boss, shit, everything I does, I do
I don't even wanna buy it if I can't cop two
If it ain't about no paper, then it ain't about who?
Ain’t about I, 'cause I be on my grind
I’m a Trap-A-Holic, my niggas be ballin
You niggas be fraudin', I spit like I'm retarded
You niggas know the deal, I be ridin' Martian
Pull up in a spaceship, shit on you like a toilet
Them bitches be like "aw damn," haters gotta smell my shit
Red horse on my shirt, red stripes on my kicks
Put that Porsche shit to work, Boxster pop a slip
Slide through your hood like, "Hater, what's good?"

[Chorus]
You know me, I'm so fly
Be lookin like money every time I ride by
Got them Benjis in my pocket and money on my mind
If it ain't about no paper, then it ain't about I
Cause I get-get-get it, money I get
When I step up in the club, I be feelin like Mitch
When I be in the hood, I be ridin with your bitch
You know she prolly on my dick 'cause I'm prolly the shit

[Verse 2]
I say I got my first bit of money thought I knew it all
Went to MIA, South Beach, blew it all
Came back to the hood trappin super hard
Super down, look at me now, Superstar
In dat black on black Charger rims soy sauce
Bunch of diamonds in my chain, the wrist
Bitches gimmie head and tail like a quater toss
Cause I just signed to grand hustle I’m for sure to ball
I say we be the freshest, jewelry be VVS-ing
Caddy be DTS-ing, like Khaled, shit, we the best
And I tell them hoes I don’t wanna talk, just leave a message
Automatic stash boxes so they can’t see the weapons
But I be GT reppin Grand Hustle, the muscle
No we don’t love these whores, I just love when I fuck 'em
No I don’t tuck em, nor do I love em or cuff em
I just hit em and split em, pass em off to my cousin

[Chorus]
You know me, I'm so fly
Be lookin like money every time I ride by
Got them Benjis in my pocket and money on my mind
If it ain't about no paper, then it ain't about I
Cause I get-get-get it, money I get
When I step up in the club, I be feelin like Mitch
When I be in the hood, I be ridin with your bitch
You know she prolly on my dick 'cause I'm prolly the shit
Say K, are we gon' lay up back?
Kick this bitch raw, you heard me

Check, check one, kick this shit raw
Y'all know me
They say that's the nigga, that's the nigga
That's the nigga, that's the nigga
That's the nigga, that's the nigga
That's the nigga, that's the nigga
Turn your hands towards your ass an' say bye bye
From the South side, South side, puff ya ya ya
Nothin' but the fire ya
Eardrums snatchin', champion, cheap rhyme busters
'Til the day I die
I say I lie
Bitch, I'll be fuckin' on your grave singin', Ay la ba
I throw 'em off, I'm two scoops from coo coo
I swoosh through your fruit loops, poo poo in your Fubu
Y'all niggas remember what happened to that mosquito
Stop your water, turn off your gas, cut off your lights
Move you out, cut your grass, watch your kids, fuck your wife
Like a bacon, egg an' cheese sandwich, I'm good
Mmm, like syrup on the biscuit an' orange juice 

[Incomprehensible]
Come an' let me take you by the hand an' walk ya
I'm the thief in the night that slide your drawers off ya
Watch where ya steppin', I'm a verbal weapon
Bring more pain then when John Wayne came on old westerns
What is the actual fuckin' meanin'?
I come in this bitch without leavin', this bitch that think we leanin'
It's been like that since way back
I used to rock eight tracks before I rocked eight decks
Concepts goin', stay fat, concerts goin', stay packed
Ownership's goin', stay black, nigga, this is payback
I scrape ya somethin' crawlin' to establishment
Now I'm Country Club livin' from the scribble, scrabblin' my talent
Proper, proper droppin' somethin' decent
Y'all niggas is as fucked up as Santa Clause for Easter
I'm a keep comin' as long as KLC keep drummin'
An' the only way to stop me is call the people for me
Fuck them people, I'll fuck over you if I have to
That's the nigga, that's that bastard
That's the nigga, that's the nigga
That's the nigga, that's the nigga
That's the nigga, that's the nigga
That's the nigga, that's the nigga
That's the nigga, that's the nigga
That's the nigga, that's the nigga
That's the nigga, that's the nigga
That's the nigga, that's that bastard
I'm that nigga, I'm that the nigga
I'm that nigga, I'm that the nigga
I'm that nigga, I'm that the nigga
I'm that nigga, I'm that the nigga
Who that with that say they can't sell, boy?
They from third ward, I'm from 12th ward
For y'all 

[Incomprehensible]
The guitars on these boys an' get down an' go off
All sides get high when they ride to my words
They mine an' they high when I'm live in concert
Fuck who you bringin', just ain't no show 

[Incomprehensible]
I don't need nine or ten pack
Of niggas rappin' with me, I'm independent
Make frontin', stuntin' niggas lose their stomach
They lose their clout, they lose their cool
An' after I come in this bitch, they lose their woman
Hello Ghetto Fabulous an' big mansions an' fine fabrics
Like a man, my money an' my pussy come automatic
You don't wanna status with a hardcore rhyme fanatic
Full speed dead at it, vocabulary acrobatic
That's him, that's that rapper
That's the man, that's the nigga, that's that bastard
That's the nigga, that's the nigga
That's the nigga, that's the nigga
What is the actually fuckin' meanin'?

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
If you can just get your mind together
Then come on across to me
We'll hold hands, and then we'll watch the sunrise
From the bottom of the sea

[Chorus]
But first, are you experienced?
Or have you ever been experienced?
Well, I have

[Verse 2]
I know, I know you probably scream and cry
That your little world won't let you go
But who in your measly little world
Are you trying to prove that
You're made out of gold and, eh, can't be sold

[Chorus]
So uh, are you experienced?
Have you ever been experienced?
Well, I have
Ah, let me prove it to you

[Instrumental Break]

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Trumpets and violins I can hear in the distance
I think they're calling our names
Maybe now you can't hear them, but you will (haha)
If you just take hold of my hand

[Chorus]
Oh, but are you experienced?
Have you ever been experienced?

[Outro]
Not necessarily stoned, but beautiful

[Verse 1: Carmody]
Once there was a melody
That came from the depths of me
That's how it starts...
It came from another place
Trail I can never trace
No matter how hard
And it's strange how the story's yours now
As it leaves my voice
There was not a choice
But to release you...

[Chorus: Tom Misch & Carmody]
There was a time
Oh, to release you
When you were mine
Oh, to release you
And now you're free
Oh, to release you
'Cause I released you
Oh, to release you
(repeat)

[Verse 2: Tom Misch]
Once there was too much too say
Though I should've find a way
And that's how it starts
Sorrows and ecstasy
Grow all these words to me
No matter how hard
And it's strange how
The story's yours now
As it leaves my voice
There was not a choice
But to release you

[Chorus: Tom Misch & Carmody]
There was a time
Oh, to release you
When you were mine
Oh, to release you
And now you're free
Oh, to release you
'Cause I released you
Oh, to release you
(repeat)

And now you lay
In another's mind...
And you look like a stranger to me
And now you lay
In another's mind...
And you look like a stranger to me
To me, yeah

[Chorus: Tom Misch & Carmody]
There was a time
Oh, to release you
When you were mine
Oh, to release you
And now you're free
Oh, to release you
'Cause I released you
Oh, to release you
(repeat)

[Verse 1]
Holy moly, get a load of this cat
Just woke up and pawing for a little scratch
These two, they're a perfect match

I dipped out but only for a minute
Came right back, but she was hurt; couldn't laugh
It's blurry and overcast

(Instrumental Chorus)

[Verse 2]
She's spaced out, now everything is soaked off
All I hear is crying and it marks her eyes
All over again, goodbye
Alright, my baby is outta sight

(Chorus with dah-dah repeated)

[Outro]
Sally, I’m so sorry
I couldn’t stop
I wasn’t strong enough
What is this feeling
That's put you in your place?
A hot red burning on the side
Of your face
You feel the blood rush to your cheek
Tears start to fill your eyes
Your lips are trembling but you can't speak
You're trying, oh you're trying not to cry

Ya just got slapped
Across the face my friend
Ya just got slapped
Yes that really just happened

Well, everybody saw it, hah!
Everybody laughted and clapped
'Cause it was awesome
The way that you just got slapped
I like girls that like girls
So they have an open invitation to my world
If you know one, I am open to referrals
So go and tell a girl to tell a girl, to tell a girl
(Girl, girl, girl)
I like girls that like me
So you and me and her can have a fun menage-a-three
Let's party in the club, in the whip or in the sheets

It doesn't matter who creepin first
It don't matter who be the worst
Any secret we keepin it's gon' still hurt
You don't tell what you peeped or heard
Cause you know you did deeper dirt
Any secret we keepin it's gon' still hurt
Ever think what your girl doin when you're gone
Never think she could be doin somethin wrong
Cause she say she satisfied and happy with the life
But still you get a vibe cause you know you ain't right
I can look my woman straight into her lovely face
And she can play along like everything is AOK
Cause she know what I'm doin' but it's all part of the game
Plus I know that she's cheatin anyway
But does matter
It doesn't matter who creepin first
It don't matter who be the worst
Any secret we keepin it's gon' still hurt
You don't tell what you peeped or heard
Cause you know you did deeper dirt
Any secret we keepin it's gon' still hurt 

[Repeat]
I can't imagine us bein' apart
Like a thousand drums is beatin' on my heart
When she be givin 'way what I coulda swore was mine
But who am I to say when I do it all the time
Cause I can look my woman straight into her lovely face
And she could play along like everything is AOK
She know just what I'm doin' but it's all part of the game
Plus she knows that she's cheatin anyway
But does it matter
It doesn't matter who creepin first
It don't matter who be the worst
Any secret we keepin it's gon' still hurt
You don't tell what you peeped or heard
Cause you know you did deeper dirt
Any secret we keepin it's gon' still hurt 

[Repeat]
Guess the moral of the story don't cheat
And if you got a man or woman don't creep
I know she fine as hell nigga don't beat
But if she fine as hell nigga gon' keep her
And if you wanna get it on girl do it
Cause believe me I don' been through it
But if you love what you got
And you keep steppin out watch out cause you might just lose it
Baby, I know that you're lonely
Things are moving slowly
Only you and me
Show me something you've been doing
Talk to me so soothing
Like I wasn't here

Please don't let me leave
I want to be at home
All alone
Laying low
Livin' nice and slow

She will change the way I feel
Cook me up a meal
And she cooks it nice
I might act a little uptight
Trying to keep it lit up
Every single night

Please don't let me leave
I want to be at home
All alone
Laying low
Livin' nice and slow

[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
Ooh, uh, it's close to midnight
Something evil's lurking from the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between your eyes
You're paralyzed

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
'Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller
Thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer, thriller, OW!
I'm gonna thrill you tonight

[Bridge: Vincent Price & (Michael Jackson)]
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood
(I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
(I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller night, babe, ooh)
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of 40 thousand years
(I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller!

[Chorus: Michael Jackson]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance
Against the thing with forty eyes, girl
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer, thriller tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller, chiller
Thriller here tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller, OW!
I'm gonna thrill you tonight

[Outro: Vincent Price]
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

[Verse 1]
I can't ask you to thrill me
That'd be asking too much
I can't ask you to fulfill my expectations that you gave me
After we first touched

[Pre Chorus]
But but the feeling that been building inside me
Is too hard to resist

[Chorus]
I can't wait much longer till you tell me baby
There's some chance we'll get together maybe
Sooner or later, I'll be in with half a chance
I can't wait till I hear you tell me that you want me
Till then my dreams are gonna haunt me
Got my demons doing such a happy dance
Hey! Ah! Yeah!

[Verse 2]
Exorcise my demons, cast them out today
Only you can do it, make them go away
Let me know you love me, tell me there's a chance
I don't want to sit and watch my demons dance

[Refrain]
Watch my demons dance
Watch my demons dance
Oh no, demons dance

[Verse 3]
Girl I want you to do it
I been waiting so long
Do you have to put me through these complications
When you know I try hard not to be wrong

[Pre Chorus]
But but the feeling that been building inside me
Is too hard to resist
Ah, ah, ah

[Chorus]
I can't wait much longer till you tell me baby
There's a chance we'll get together maybe
Sooner or later, I'll be in with half a chance
I can't wait till I hear you tell me that you want me
Till then my dreams are gonna haunt me
Got my demons doing such a happy dance
Ow! Huh! Yeah!

[Verse 2]
Come on and exorcise my demons, cast them out today
Only you can do it, make them go away
Let me know you love me, tell me there's half a chance
I can't sit around and watch those demons dance

[Refrain]
Watch my demons dance
Watch my demons dance

[Outro]
Demons dance

Food stamps didn't come on time and the lights have been cut off
But look here

[Snoop]
Here's a little something about a nigga like me
I never should have been let out the penitentiary
Snoop Dogg would like to say
That I'm a crazy motherfucker when I'm playing with my AK
Since I was a youth I smoked weed out
Now I'm that motherfucker y'all read about
Smoking you and your crew, taking a life or two
You dont like how I'm living well fuck you
This is my gang nigga No Limit
My nigga C will fuck you up in a minute
With the pow pow bang bang and your dead
And then we stamp that tank on your forehead
Everywhere we go they say "DAMN"
Them gangstas they be fucking up the program
And then you realize we dont care
We dont just say no we to busy saying yeah
About drinking straight out the ???? bottle
Do I look like a motherfucking role model
To a kid looking up to me
Shit life ain't nothing but weed and money
Shit I'm that type of nigga that's quick to blast
Fuck with me or C and I'll put my foot in your ass
I dont give a fuck cause I keep selling
Yo what the fuck are the yelling

[Chorus x2]
Gangsta Gangsta Thats what the yelling
Niggas living rowdy and stay bout it bout it
Gangsta Gangsta Thats what the selling
Bitches want to buy it cause they love that straight G shit

[Snoop]
Homies all standing around just hanging
Some dope dealing some gang banging
We decide to roll a week deep
Seen a nigga on Dayton so we creep
Real slow, in you before you know
I had my double pointing at his window
He got scared and hit the gas
Right then I knew I had to smoke his ass
He kept rolling I jumped in the bucket
We couldn't catch him so I said fuck it
Then we headed right back to ????
Sweating all the bitches in the dazzy dukes
We couldn't no play from the ladies
With seven niggas in a Nav is you crazy
She was scared and it was showing
So we all said "FUCK YOU BITCH" and kept rolling
To the hood now we was 'fen to
Find something else to get into
Like some pussy or in fact
Getting rowdy, shit but we caught the rat pack
On a nigga cold nutting it off
Snoop Dogg gets ignorant when I'm fucking with my tank dogs
I might stumble and still won't lose
Now I'm draped in my gangsta blue's
Cause I'm the type of nigga who's quick to blast
Fuck with me or C and I'll blast your ass
See I dont give a fuck cause I keep bailing
Yo what the fuck are they yelling

[Chorus x1]

[Snoop Talking]

Man fuck that we need some gangsta in this motherfucker some other that
South shit know what I'm saying
Some of that shit from the thiz-ird ya heard me

[Snoop]
Here's another gangsta down to ride
A T-shirt and Levi's is his only disguise
He represents the tank but yet hard to hit
Snoop Dogg and C-Murder with this gangsta shit

[C-Murder]
Well I'm C-Murder the one he talking about
Nigga tried to play me close and got punched in the mouth
Fed's tried to get me you know they some haters
I said "See you later" jumped in the Navigator
With the $50's in the back with the navy blue top
TRU niggas on the scene with the triple beam

And I'll smoke a motherfucker like it ain't no thing
To all my bitches, I know your jocking my crew

Yo what the fuck are they yelling

[Chorus x1]

[Eddie Talking]
If you'd of just stay down and been a motherfuckers real partner you
Wouldn't have had tat problem
But seeing as you want to jump ship and you thought the ship would sink
A motherfucker without turning into a submarine, went under water came
Back up with a periscope looking at your bitch ass

[Verse 1]
You brought us to your gift of generosity
And all our silly games wreak havoc on your soils

[Chorus 1]
When I stop to think of all that

[Verse 2]
Every life is like a song that takes forever to be sung
When all our silly games wreak havoc on our spoils

[Chorus 2]
When I stop to think of all that we've done
Satan's at the door

[Verse 3]
Every second, every minute, every hour, every day
He's watching you and passing judgement to everybody you hold dear

[Chorus 3]
And when I stop to think of all that we've done
Satan's at the door
Who's he looking for?
Thern old bad dreams
Been sleeping in your bed
And them old dark clouds
Been hanging around your head
But all your hard times
Will vanish in the wind
When the mighty clouds of joy
Come rolling in
Holy Jesus
Let Your love seize us
Oh, let us find sweet peace within
Hallelujah
Happiness begins
When the mighty clouds of joy
Come rolling in
Those old storm clouds
Are slowly drifting by
And those old raindrops
Are fading from your eyes
Oh, Mr. Sun
Will shine on us again
When the mighty clouds of joy
Come rolling in
Oh, Holy Jesus
Let Your love seize us Jesus
Oh, let us find sweet peace within
Hallelujah
Happiness begins
When the mighty clouds of joy
Come rolling in
Oh, Holy Jesus
Please let Your love seize us Jesus
Oh, let us find sweet peace within
Hallelujah
Happiness begins
When the mighty clouds of joy
Come rolling in
Oh, Holy Jesus
Won't You let Your love seize us Jesus
Oh, let us find sweet peace within
Hallelujah
Happiness begins
When the mighty clouds of joy

That's why I called her, my new fan league

She's the only one that I want by my side
She's the only one that I believe can save my life
She makes me wanna be a better man ohh why
She's higher then the sky, the suns and the moon

She's like a star, like a star, like a star, (ohh baby)
She's like a star, like a star, like a star, (ohh baby)

Is it cliche, to say she's destiny
It's no one else but her, well at least for me
That's exactly why, I must now repeat

She's the only one that I want by my side
She's the only one that I believe can save my life
She makes me wanna be a better man ohh why
She's higher then the sky, the suns and the moon

Beats on the G5, songs I write, just so I can take her on a G5 flights
Ya she my type, just my height, she's my fan, she's just right
She's like, “I think we might, go far”, I'm like, “you right”
She could be my angel wings, her voice sounds like an angel sings
Ya I'll be back with the trade mark strings
Just try to compliment the sounds she brings
She's like, “We could go far”, I'm like, “you you you are”
I'm like, “you you you are”
You are, my guiding star
She's like a star, like a star, like a star, (ohh baby)
She's like a star, like a star, like a star, (ohh baby)
She's like a star, like a star, like a star, (ohh baby)
She's like a star, like a star, like a star, (ohh baby)

Could it be , I'm in love with you
Ever since I saw you in the moonlight
I've had this feeling through and through
Since that time , I haven't done a thing right
Could it be , I'm in love with you
Golly gee , I don't know where I'm goin'
I'm tryin' to make you see
Oh boy, I got to make her fall in love with me , oh
Night after night , I'm always dreamin'
Why don't you make those dreams come true
Can't you see how much I really love you
Why don't you learn to love me too

Im in a star burst 64 riding low
On them gold daytonas and im slyding slow
You ain't nothing like me, so what ya hire me for
That bitch you with looking, keep behind ya ho!!
Its all about feddi, with the chevy rage
With a bitch on a blade
Keep me havy paid

Black 7 tray, blue bandana, dipping sets
Looking for jewels like his own santana
Break pounds down the zone, in a back gramsa
Raw ounce ing im sharp bouncing
Yeh
40ounce liquor poor like water fountans
For all the late night
Body counting
You niggas got the urge and the tentacy
So deal with me 17 the burge and the G"s
With my blood bitch, im sleeping with the
Enemy
I call it bomb pussy off n hennesy
Diverend comode same old shit
You slippin, who hit ya
The sameold bitch

Scorned pimpin, when im flippin
Cocain bricks

That gold frame lifts so;

Im in that bentley gt riding low
24 cc and im sliding slow
You ain't nothing like me
So what ya hire me fo"
That bitch you withlooking, keep behind ya ho"

Im in a starburst 64
Riding low
On them gold daytona"s
And im sliding slow
You ain't nothing like me
So what ya hire me fo"
That bitch you with looking, keep behind ya ho"
Living in the filty west
Gotta keep the smith and tha vest
People are pressed
Liberties crushed
Shouldn't it resound
Cry of our soul?
It is so faint I can't hear it
I know it's there
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere

Men could ask for happiness
They could ask for brotherhood
When we were not a lonely crowd
Natural was impersonal
Was non individual
Where strangers were not a threat
But more of a potential
Public space was wide open
The relevance was action

Beyond the cry
Lies the meaning
Common language
Of belonging
It is throttled, it is confused
Has to be there
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere...
I'm sure to fall
Fall in love
I'm sure to fall in love with you
You are so sweet
And so near
I'm sure to fall in love with you
So hold me tight
Let tonight be the night
Darling, don't ever let me go
Loving you
Is the natural thing to do
I want you for the rest of my life
So hold me tight
Let tonight be the night
Darling, don't ever let me go
Loving you
Is the natural thing to do
I want you for the rest of my life

[Verse]
Are you true? I wish I knew
I'm in the middle of a riddle 'cause I'm so in love with you
Can't you see I'm up a tree
Right in the middle of a riddle 'cause you won't belong to me

[Chorus]
Though I show I love you so
I've got a feeling you're concealing something that I ought to know
If you love me, say that you do
I'm in the middle of a riddle over you

Though I show I love you so
I've got a feeling you're concealing something that I ought to know
If you love me, say that you do
I'm in the middle of a riddle over you

[Bridge]
I'm in the middle of a riddle 'cause I'm so in love with you
Right in the middle of a riddle 'cause you won't belong to me

[Chorus]
Though I show I love you so
I've got a feeling you're concealing something that I ought to know
If you love me, say that you do
I'm in the middle of a riddle over you

[Intro]
Young and I'm getting it, young and I'm getting it
Young and I'm getting it, I'm just young and I don't give a shit
I just want the money, y'all can keep them bitches cause I'm young and I'm getting it
I'm young and I'm getting it

[Hook]
Okay I wake up in the morning, and I see dollar signs
Shawty wanna roll and I'm like aw man she fine

Why you hating on me, huh, I'm just living my life

Young and I'm getting it, I'm just young and I don't give a shit
I just want the money, y'all can keep them bitches cause I'm young and I'm getting it
I'm young and I'm getting it

[Verse 1]
Yeah, young nigga I get money and fuck hoes in my spare time
She don't fuck on the first night, then she don't meet my dead line
Niggas smoking that Bob Marley, that Bob Marley like yeah molly
I'm sipping on the whole 8th for that purp shit, bed time
I cop fours like yours, y'all niggas ain't important
Shawty want that molly, and I'ma get what she order
Tats all on my body, strapped up like a war
Eat the pussy I'll prolly, if it smell like water
Her neck talk say fuck me, my wrist talk say suck me
The niggas claiming they balling, I take your bitch Chris Humphrey
And make them buy me a whip nigga
Nothing less than the 6 nigga

[Hook]
Okay, I wake up in the morning and I see dollar signs

[Verse 2]
Okay, your baby mama, I ball that, side chick I ball that
Main chick, I ball that, and your dream girl just called back
I'm still repping that north side with that big P on my ballcap
These broke niggas don't like me, cause they say I think I'm all that
Now come cop that 'rarri, I don't need to feel sorry
Niggas claiming my flows, I should put these niggas on Maury
And I ain't claiming these hoes, have these haters looking all salty
When I pulled up in that Roll's, swag was surfing on 'em like narley
I'm with 3 hoes like Santa Clause, saying I'm the boss, Diana Ross

Watch me ball like you sittin' with Phil at
Ten car caravan Aston Martin's and all them hood whips
Them Cutlass's them Cadillacs's that leather be grippin' them wood tips
I was born up in the wood, claim Compton bet you ain't know that

Went from a boy to a king, any block I five five four that
Nigga better know that, boy they playin'
Sawed off shotty

Hop in that truck and get lost
You playin' wit a king not Gretzky
Even if ya let me, keep yo girl wetter than Game on a jet ski
Oo, cool, who say he smoother than a baby's ass

Look on that Mercedes dash, boy you know what it is

[Chorus - Wiz Khalifa]

[YG]
Ridin' down Rose greens, Compton, California
Turn on the wrong street they might bang on ya
Home of the Lakers baby, yea you know its purp and yellow
Take a hit of what I got, I bet it have you seeing doubles
But I'm an angel though, and your girls a pigeon
Its money over everything, girl you know the vision
Never been a mark if ya with it we can cut ya fade
Brought out 50 blew up the city, young Saddam Hussein
Pusha Ink the label baby, everything else is f-ckin boring
I'm at Roscoes eatin wit some chicks who foreign

My white Beamer do the Wiz Khalifa, push to start

[Chorus x2]
Looking up there's always sky
Rest your head I'll take you high
We won't fade into darkness
Won't let you fade into darkness
Why worry now

Hold my hand, just in case
And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
No we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness

Fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
Fade into darkness

And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
No we won't fade into darkness
This world can seem cold and gray
But you and I are here today
And we won't fade into darkness
Fade into darkness
Nothing to fear but fear itself
We'll be ok just keep the faith
And we won't fade into darkness
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she is away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she is always gone too long
Anytime she goes away

Wonder this time where she is gone
Wonder if she is going to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she is gone
And this house just is no home
Anytime she goes away

I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, know, know, know, know
I know, I know
Hey I ought to leave
I ought to leave her alone
Ain't no sunshine when she is gone

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when she is gone
And this house just is no home
Anytime she goes away

Andre! Hello?!

[Verse 1]
Smile an everlasting smile
A smile can bring you near to me
Don't ever let me find you gone
Cause that would bring a tear to me

[Verse 2]
This world has lost its glory
Let's start a brand new story
Now my love, right now
There'll be no other time
And I can show you how, my love

[Verse 3]
Talk in everlasting words
And dedicate them all to me
And I will give you all my life
I'm here if you should call to me

[Pre-Chorus]
You think that I don't even mean
A single word I say

[Chorus]
It's only words, and words are all I have
To take your heart away

[Pre-Chorus]
You think that I don't even mean
A single word I say

[Chorus]
It's only words, and words are all I have
To take your heart away

[Outro]
It's only words, and words are all I have
To take your heart away
It's only words, and words are all I have
To take your heart away
While the Angelus was ringing, calling for the evening pray'r
I could hear the choir singing and I saw you standing there
Silently I stood beside you, how my heart was beating then
For my dreams have all come true, I was safely back with you
Never more to roam again
Then the great cathedral spire seemed to come alive and say
Through the voices of the choir, there will be a wedding day
Then a golden ray of sunlight, from a window in the sky
Shone upon us from above, heaven's blessing on our love
Now our love will never die

Then a golden ray of sunlight, from a window in the sky
Shone upon us from above, heaven's blessing on our love
Now our love will never die

[Intro: Taio Cruz]
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh

[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your...

[Verse 1: Taio Cruz]
Now listen to me, baby
Before I love and leave you
They call me heart breaker
I don't wanna deceive you

[Pre-Chorus: Taio Cruz]
If you fall for me
I'm not easy to please
I might tear you apart
Told you from the start, baby, from the start

[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart

[Post-Chorus: Taio Cruz]
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh

[Verse 2: Taio Cruz]
There's no point trying to hide it
No point trying to evade it
I know I got a problem
Problem with misbehavin'

[Pre-Chorus: Taio Cruz]
If you fall for me
I'm not easy to please
I might tear you apart
Told you from the start, baby, from the start

[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart

[Post-Chorus: Taio Cruz]
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
(Thats all I'm gonna do, woman)
Listen, now I'm only gonna break your heart
And shatter and splatter it all into little itty-bitty pieces
Whether or not you get it all together
Then it's finders, keepers, and losers weepers
See, I'm not tryin' to lead you on, no, I'm only tryin' to keep it real
You might say this is Ludacris, but Taio Cruz, tell her how you feel!
Now I may not be the worst or the best
But you gotta respect my honesty
And I may break your heart, heart, heart, break break, your heart
So you can take this chance in the end
Everybody's gonna be wonderin' how you deal
You might say this is Ludacris
But Taio Cruz, tell her how you feel

[Bridge: Taio Cruz]
And I know karma's gonna get me back for being so cold
Like a big bad wolf, I'm born to be bad and bad to the bone
If you fall for me, I'm only gonna tear you apart
Told you from the start

[Chorus: Taio Cruz]
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart
I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart

[Verse 1]
Press play, fast forward
Non stop we have the beaten path before us
It was all there, in plain sight
Come on people, we have all seen the sunshine

[Pre-Chorus]
We will never get back to
To the old school
To the old rounds, it's all about the newfound
We are the newborn, the world know all abouts
(We are the future and we're here to stay)

[Chorus]
We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back, at the faded silhouette
We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back, at the faded silhouette

[Beat Break]

[Verse 2]
Straight ahead on the path we have before us
Day by day, soon the change will come
Don't you know we took a big step forward
Just lead the way and we pull the trigger

[Pre-Chorus]
And we will never get back to
To the old school
To the old grounds, it's all about the newfound
We are the newborn, the world know all about us
(We are the future and we're here to stay)

[Chorus]
We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back, at the faded silhouette
We've come a long way since that day

We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back, at the faded silhouette
We've come a long way since that day
And we will never look back,  look back at the faded silhouette

[Verse 1]
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll bet she's beautiful
That girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

[Verse 2]
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

[Pre-Chorus]
He says he's so in love
He's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do

[Verse 3]
Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

[Pre-Chorus]
She'd better hold him tight
Give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do

[Bridge]
So I drive home alone
As I turn off the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight

[Chorus]
'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who’s got enough for me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do (Why I do)
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

[Outro]
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
Lil Wayne (Verse 1)
AK on my night stand, right next to that bible
But I swear with these 50 shots, I'll shoot it out with 5-0
Pockets gettin' too fat, no weight watchers no lipo
Money talks, bullshit walks, on a mother fuckin tight rope

[Chorus]
Ooh, farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl, I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh

[Verse 1]
I found my happiest days
When you came to see your grandma in May
I bumped into you at the corner store
I told you that you sure looked good, now
Your grandma's house was next to mine
We were together most of the time
But summer's gotten away from us
Time's moving too fast for us
Bye-bye, don't turn around
'Cause you might see me cry

[Chorus]
Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl, I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh yeah

[Verse 2]
When you return to your hometown
And you discuss your trip
Will I be the guy that you put down
Or someone that you don't forget? No
I'll never forget you
And maybe next year when you're out of school
You'll return, but until you do, baby
Bye-bye, don't turn around
You might see me cry

[Chorus]
Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl, I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, yeah

When you return to your hometown
And you discuss your trip
Will I be the guy that you put down
Or someone that you don't forget? No
I'll never forget you
And maybe next year when you're out of school
You'll return, but until you do, baby
Bye-bye, don't turn around
You might see me cry

[Chorus]
Farewell my summer love, farewell, ooh yeah
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, yeah, oh yeah
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, farewell yeah, yeah, yeah

Chorus:
Woop-woop!
That's the sound of da police!
Woop-woop!
That's the sound of the beast!

Verse One:
Stand clear! Don man a-talk
You can't stand where I stand, you can't walk where I walk
Watch out! We run New York
Police man come, we bust him out the park
I know this for a fact, you don't like how I act
You claim I'm sellin' crack
But you be doin' that
I'd rather say "see ya"
Cause I would never be ya
Be a officer? You WICKED overseer!
Ya hotshot, wanna get props and be a saviour
First show a little respect, change your behavior
Change your attitude, change your plan
There could never really be justice on stolen land
Are you really for peace and equality?
Or when my car is hooked up, you know you wanna follow me
Your laws are minimal
Cause you won't even think about lookin' at the real criminal
This has got to cease
Cause we be getting HYPED to the sound of da police!
Chorus

Verse Two:
Now here's a likkle truth
Open up your eye
While you're checking out the boom-bap, check the exercise
Take the word "overseer," like a sample
Repeat it very quickly in a crew for example
Overseer
Overseer
Overseer
Overseer
Officer, Officer, Officer, Officer!
Yeah, officer from overseer
You need a little clarity?
Check the similarity!
The overseer rode around the plantation
The officer is off patroling all the nation
The overseer could stop you what you're doing
The officer will pull you over just when he's pursuing
The overseer had the right to get ill
And if you fought back, the overseer had the right to kill
The officer has the right to arrest
And if you fight back they put a hole in your chest!
(Woop!) They both ride horses
After 400 years, I've _got_ no choices!
The police them have a little gun
So when I'm on the streets, I walk around with a bigger one
(Woop-woop!) I hear it all day
Just so they can run the light and be upon their way
Chorus

Verse Three:
Check out the message in a rough stylee
The real criminals are the C-O-P
You check for undercover and the one PD
But just a mere Black man, them want check me
Them check out me car for it shine like the sun
But them jealous or them vexed cause them can't afford one
Black people still slaves up til today
But the Black police officer nah see it that way
Him want a salary
Him want it
So he put on a badge and kill people for it
My grandfather had to deal with the cops
My great-grandfather dealt with the cops
My GREAT grandfather had to deal with the cops
And then my great, great, great, great... when it's gonna stop?!

Chorus

[Refrain]
Ring the alarm
I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Don't you ring the alarm
I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

[Chorus]
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gone rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (Coupes)
In the 'Bach carter rolls
If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if let you go

[Verse 1]
Tell me how should I feel
When I know what I know
And my female intuition
Telling me you a dog
People told me 'bout the flames
I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations
What you mean you gone choke?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You can't stay, you gotta go
Ain't no other chick spending ya dough
This is taking a toll
The way the story unfolds
Not the picture perfect movie everyone would've saw

[Chorus]
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gone rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (Coupes)
In the 'Bach carter rolls
If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if let you go

[Refrain]
Ring the alarm
I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm
Don't you ring the alarm
I've been through this too long
But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm

[Verse 2]
Tell me how should I feel
When you made me belong
And the thought of you just touching her is what I hate most
I don't want you, but I want it and I can't let it go
To know you give it to her like you gave it to me, come on

[Pre-Chorus 2]
(Oh)
He's so arrogant and bold (Oh)
But she gon' love that shit, I know
I done put in a call
Time to ring the alarm
'Cause you ain't never seen a fire like the one I'm gon' cause

[Chorus]
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gone rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (Coupes)
In the 'Bach carter rolls
If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if let you go

[Bridge]
How can you look at me
And not see all the things that I kept only just for you?
Why would you risk it, baby?
Is that the price I that pay?
But this is my show and I won't let you go
All it's been paid for, and it's mine
How could you look at me
And not see all the things?
(See all the things, see all the things)

[Chorus]
She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats
If I let you go
Benz and the house off the coast
If I let you go
She gon' take everything I own
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if I let you go
She gone rock them VVS stones
If I let you go (Coupes)
In the 'Bach carter rolls
If I let you go
She go profit everything I taught
If I let you go
I can't let you go
Damned if let you go

Blot out my transgressions

According to your great compassion
Blot out my transgressions

Would you create in me a clean heart, oh God?
Restore in me the joy of your salvation

The sacrifices of our God
Are broken in a contrite heart
Against you and you alone
Have I sinned?

Walking in the open sun
Looking for someplace to have fun
Walking in the open sun
Looking for someplace to have fun
Said I’m walkin’

(“Keep on walkin’…walk) (Repeated until end)

[Ron Isley (over chant)]
Walk on
Come on, feet…walk on
Walking in the open air
Wind blowing through my baby’s hair
Said I’m walking through the open
Wind blowing through my woman’s hair
Said I’m walking…walk on
Come on, feet…walk on
Don’t stop now…keep on walkin’
Don’t stop feet, carry me home
Come on, feet…help me walk there
Walking in the open sun
Had myself a lot of fun
Come on, feet…don’t let me down
Come on, feet…put ‘em on the ground
Come on, feet
Walking in the open air
Wind blowing through my baby’s hair
I said I’m walking through the open air
Wind blowing through my baby’s hair
Aaah, ooh, ooh, oh, Lord have mercy
Come on, feet; come on, feet…keep on walkin’
Come on, feet; come on, feet…oh, keep walkin’
Don’t let me down; don’t let me down
Put ‘em on the ground; put ‘em on the ground
Don’t let me down now; don’t let me down
Put ‘em on the ground; put ‘em on the ground
Come on, feet; come on, feet…

[Verse 1]
Well I'm always saying I'm sorry
You're always saying you're broke
But I'll keep my hands on the steering wheel
If you keep your eyes on the road

[Chorus]
But it's not like you anyway
To hide your sad face away
It ain't gonna stay the same
'Cause it's got old

[Verse 2]
You'll always run me in circles
Chasing me round like a mouse
But I'll keep on watching this movie
If it means I can stay at your house

[Chorus]
But it's not like you anyway
To hide your sad face away
It ain't gonna stay the same
'Cause it's got old
'Cause it's got old
'Cause it's got old
'Cause it's got old
'Cause it's got old
My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner

If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week

'We were born sick, ' you heard them say it

My Church offers no absolutes
She tells me, 'Worship in the bedroom.'
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you—

I was born sick
But I love it
Command me to be well
Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice

Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful

That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
No Masters or Kings
When the Ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin

In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am Human
Only then I am Clean
Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Young money cash money till I'm killed nigga
Bet my funeral be over packed with real niggas
Started on a black top with a few pieces of crack rock
Now it's just him pumpin his motherfuckin black rock
Earn my stripes like a motherfuckin black sock
Now it's like we hit the motherfuckin jackpot
Hurricane catrina is the motherfuckin back drop
Man you know them niggas got that motherfucker backhot
I'm tryna see how to get that new book, rock black drop
I'm a PI a'ight? A'ight

[Verse 1]
Never thought that I could really trust you (Trust you)
Ever since I fell out of love with you
But when I lay you down (Lay you down)
You turn my feelings around
Something ‘bout your seductive beauty (Beauty)
Things you do that nobody else can do to me
Captivating my mind
Doing just what I like

[Chorus]
My mind’s telling me that I hate you
But my body’s saying (I want that)
Tried to play me on the low
Still my body’s saying (I need that)
Contagious is what you gotta be
Still my body’s saying (I want that)
All of my boys say you ain’t right, baby
But my body’s saying (I need that)

[Verse 2]
From the ice to the trips to Hawaii (Hello)
BMWs and Benzes with the 20’s
I gave you everything (Everything)
Then you went and bounced on me
Every night I still think about you
Sipping wine, making was our chemistry (Ooh yeah)
Laying in bed all day
Ooh girl, I miss those days

[Chorus]
My mind’s telling me that I hate you
But my body’s saying (I want that)
Tried to play me on the low
Still my body’s saying (I need that)
Contagious is what you gotta be
Still my body’s saying (I want that)
All of my boys say you ain’t right, baby
But my body’s saying (I need that)

[Bridge]
Your pretty tone (I’m thinkin’ ‘bout that)
French manicure (I’m thinkin’ ‘bout that)
You’re so prime (That’s why you got me)
Sprung on your…your love

[Chorus]
My mind is telling me that I hate you
But my body’s saying (I want that)
Tried to play me on the low
Still my body’s saying (I need that)
Contagious is what you gotta be
Still my body’s saying (I want that)
All of my boys say you ain’t right, baby
But my body’s saying (I need that)
My mind is telling me that I hate you
But my body’s saying (I want that)
Tried to play me on the low
Still my body’s saying (I need that)
Contagious is what you gotta be
Still my body’s saying (I want that)
All of my boys say you ain’t right, baby
But my body’s saying (I need that)

Ah, even the preacher said you ain’t right for me (I want that)
All of my family say leave you alone, but I… (I need that)
Oh, even my best friend, my best friend (I want that)
All say you ain’t right for me…
"I'll Make It Right"

Oh no, no, no, no, no, oh baby

I'll make it right
Baby you know that I can make it right

Keep it on a cutie girl cause I'm really into you yeah

Anything you ask i'll do for you
So baby don't you see
You mean the world to me
Just one thing I have to know
Baby can I make it right

As I'm looking into your eyes all I see is you lovely face
And there's nothin' I like more than to show you I adore
The simple things that you do to me with the sweet little
Things you say
Baby when I kiss your lips it really brightens up my day
Oh Oh Oh
Anything you ask I'll do for you
You mean the world to me
Just one thing I have to know

So baby don't you see you mean the world to me
If you just swing my way

So tell me where do we go from here
Oh yeah

There's nowhere that we can go
But take it nice and slow
Baby enjoy the flow
Lots of pleasures I can give
I've got it waitin' here
So put away your fears
Thank you, Lord, for what you've done for me
Thank you, Lord, for what you're doing now
Thank you, Lord, for ev'ry little thing
Thank you, Lord, for you made me sing

Say I'm in no competition
But I made my decision
You can keep your opinion
I'm just calling on the wise man's communion

Thank you, Lord, for what you've done for me
Thank you, Lord, for what you're doing now
Thank you, Lord, for ev'ry little thing

[Verse 1]
If you ain't made it now, you'll never gonna make it
Seventeen people in the dark tonight
You see some familiar faces
Behind the cellular lights

[Verse 2]
Chi-Town in the winter
Then we saw the Hollywood sun
Used to drink more than your man could
Waiting for the light
Waiting for the light
Waiting for the light

[Chorus]
Nothing like the way it feels
Nothing like the way it feels
To drive
Still remember all the words
To every song you ever heard
Drive

[Verse 3]
All the things I steel in the car
Let it freeze, let them crack
You slept through the day and the night and the day
You're never coming back
You're never coming back
You're never coming back

[Chorus]
Nothing like the way it feels
Nothing like the way it feels
To drive
Still remember all the words
To every song you ever heard
Drive

[Chorus]
Nothing like the way it feels
Nothing like the way it feels
To drive
Still remember all the words
To every song you ever heard
Drive

[Hook: will.i.am]
Yesterday, yesterday, yesterday
I wanna go back to yesterday
I wanna go back to yesterday
I wanna go back to yesterday
I wanna go back to yesterday
Yesterday

[Verse 1: Taboo, will.i.am and apl.de.ap]
We going back to the front, give them what they want
Back to the past, retro glass
Back to the leader, back to reviews
Take 'em back to the future, take 'em to the true school
Cause we was breaking atoms, live at the barbeque
Now we reminiscing, pumping Audio Two
Listening to niggas, niggas with them attitudes
Apl was a Black Sheep screaming out
"You can get with this or you can get with that"
Smoke emcees, or you could smoke crack
You can sell dope, or you can sell raps
I sell dope raps cause that's where it's at
Now I'm back on the scene, crispy and clean
Hip hop fiend, Source Magazine
World Famous is the Supreme Team
SP-1200 drum machine
Hail to Latifah, she be the queen
DMC and Run be the kings
King of Rock! My nigga Ice-T killed a cop
And we be to rap what key be to lock

[Interlude: will.i.am and apl.de.ap]
I'm cool like that, I'm cool like that
I move like that because I'm smooth like that
I rap like that because I'm phat like that
I rock like that because I got it like that
And I'm ill like that, skilled like that
Phil-i-ppines, cause I feel like that
I'm real like that, yes, I'm chill like that
You gots to chill

[Verse 2: will.i.am, Taboo and apl.de.ap]
I got pounds and pounds of peas, you know
I'm not Large Professor but I'm an extra pro
Punks jump up to punk rock'n'roll
The Master P-nut is a pistachio
The Peas peak past the pinnacle plateau
Posses a fresh Porsche, I don't push Peugeot
Packing out paper in a pass I was pulled
Get paid to rock mics and used to call the show
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
Check the flow yo, 'cause this retro
It's my classic mani-fucking-festo
Lyrically, I'm magic, fucking presto
Insuring hip-hop like gecko
Making sure it won't stop, baby, heck no
That's a what, that's a what, the scenario
Reminiscing while I listen to the stereo

[Interlude: will.i.am]
I reminisce, I reminisce
I reminisce, I reminisce
When it's sounding like this
Downtown, go round

[Hook: will.i.am]
I wanna go back to yesterday
I wanna go back to yesterday
I wanna go back to rappable
Cause oh baby, I like it raw
Yeah baby, I like it raw
Oh baby I like it raw
Yeah baby, I like it raw

[Verse 3: will.i.am, apl.de.ap and Taboo]
Shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yam, shimmy yay
Comment allez-vous, parlez vous francais?
Adiós, motherfuckers, bon voyage
Home of the liquid flows and Liquid Swords
Black-Eyed Killer Peas on the swarm
Coming to your college and disco dorm
Y'all can't touch my skills
I can switch it up, Das EFX, and get iggity-iggity-ill
Yiggity-yes, rapper, my style is unique
Iggity-ice on my teeth so it's cold when I speak
Word to mom, I'm in my own world
Galaxy rays! Powerful

[Hook: will.i.am]
I wanna go back to yesterday
I wanna go back to yesterday
I wanna go back to yesterday

[Verse 4: Taboo, apl.de.ap and will.i.am]
So I can hit you with the bass, how low can you go?
I get lower than a midget doing limbo
I got shit that you haven't heard a while ago
'88-'92 the style'll go
Way back, rocking on the A-track
Memorex, TDK, all of that
Throwback before all the Nazareth
Willy is his name and the boy's coming
Straight Outta L.A! A crazy motherfucker named Willy
I'm so cold, my flow stay chilly
I got a laser aimed at them haters
And I'm cutting motherfuckers with my razor
You too, boy, if you fuck with me
I'ma dice you up, slice you up quickly
I signed to Ruthless when Dre dropped "Dre Day"
That's why I do this, to bring you back to yesterday
(Yesterday, yesterday, yesterday)
Tiger style
There's no place to hide as I step inside the room
Dr. Doom, prepare for the boom
Bam, I slam, aw, man
You fucking with will.i.am!
Cause I'm torching and scorching, my style is awesome
Cracking motherfuckers' skulls like it's porcelain
Aiyyo, let's save hip hop from Dr. Kevorkian
Bring it right here, right back to its origin
Aiyyo, I'ma hop in my motherfucking DeLorean
So I can go back and fucking perform again
Aiyyo, I did some windmills on some fucking linoleum
MC mic controlling them, I was like
(Woop-woop!) I was steady policing them
Killing emcees, I was straight deceasing them
(Woop-woop!) Compute-deleting them 'til them niggas don't exist
Because Black Eyes Peas is hard as hell!
Battle anybody, I don't care if you tell
I excel! They all fail!
I told them motherfuckers I'mma take them—

[Outro: will.i.am]
Back to yesterday
I'm taking you back to yesterday
I'm taking you back to yesterday
I'm taking you back to yesterday
I took you back to yesterday

Taking you to the future
Take you to the future
Take you to the future
Future, future, future, future, future...

"I've got a voice in my head, voice in my head"; that's what it said, all we really need is some comic relief

[Bridge]
But I'm afraid of not being able to laugh anymore (Oh)
What's life going to become once we don't have anymore heroes?

[Hook]
We don't know what the next man's going through, wish I could say it in a plainer way
I said we don't know, life reminds me of Robin Williams; we've got to laugh the pain away
We don't know what the next man's going through, wish I could say it in a plainer way
I said we don't know, life reminds me of Robin Williams; we've got to laugh the pain away

I was only asking for a moment of the truth
I can't fight the feeling when I'm hanging out with you
Why do I forgive you, because I get confused
I could never leave behind the part of me that you refuse

I was on the ceiling, I could almost feel the sun
Try the words in sequence but that's never how it's done
Why do our disasters creep so slowly into view
I was only after a friend to follow through
I couldn't lose

I know why you don't really know me
I don't think you can call it home
All alone I couldn't taste another thing

I was on the ceiling and I swore it might be true
I could fight the feeling but not quite as well as you

I don't know, won't you come and show me
I don't think it's what you did before
All alone I couldn't take a case like you

[Verse]
I've been having memories of my exes
All my chicks in Texas, New York, California
And all my chicks in Florida
I just gotta let you know I'm lookin' for a down ass bitch
One that all these niggas wanted
Never got to get her, when they see her they be salty, screamin' bitch
She the one that they wanted, she the one that they wanted
Still the one that I wanted, still that number one bitch
And even after all these years go, you still on my mind
It's kinda crazy, you ain't here though, no no
So remember me like old time hoes in the summer breeze
All my girls is Lebanese, Japanese, Vietnamese
Can I take your order please?
I heard that you Portuguese
Take you to my hottest place
You so bad, I had to drop that bands on you
No, you so bad the feds might build a case on you
So let a nigga know what we gon' do
See everything I do, I do for you, shawty
Don't you let them say it's not for you, shawty
You're the only one I've got, I've got
Only one bitch I've got, I've got
Don't let them tell you different
You different

Thick drink, purple maple, I could've went and bought some acres
Pull up swaggin', no blazer, cookin' dope with a apron

Draw down with the pistol then erase 'em

Those wedding bells are ringing up upon that hill
And I don't wanna swallow such a bitter pill
You keep on moving but I stay still
But I always loved you and I always will

Days of no sleeping
Caked in mud
All kinds of poison in my blood
I lost the only thing I ever loved

Ooh
I heard them ringing and processioning by
Umbrellas in the clear blue sky
I saw you swimming in that sea of white

Ooh
And wedding bells ringing up upon that hill
And I don't wanna swallow such a bitter pill
You keep on moving, baby, I stay still
I always loved you and I always will
Ooh
I loved you and I say it still
I always loved you and I always will
Singing, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

If everything that went before didn't matter
So la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I always loved you and I always will

[Intro]
Father God, forgive me. As I sit in the back of this 4 door vehicle, I know the crimes I'm about to commit. Potentially put me in jail for a decade and a half. I ask you look down upon me with mercy and judge me not by the crimes I commit, but by the character of my heart. Feel the conflicts in my soul. As of this moment, I pray that you guard with with protection. If it's gon' be my day to leave this earth by your will, I sincerely repent and accept you as my saviour

And when I'm feeling in the worst way, you know how to bring me back baby
Light shines through the crowd now, darkest days in the past nights
You don’t know what you do to me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
How can I love you more than this?
Tell me the way and I can fix it

[Chorus]
I know I'm not perfect sometimes

Oh, find me, oh Lord

Diamonds work magic like a genie
Expensive, my fabric, don't need it
Your bitch, she got a butt-head, Beavis
You know I'm kickin' shit like Feely
I really want your cat, no kitty
If I ain't talkin' to you, no speakin'
You know a nigga Slime like the deacon
So, I'm only fucking you for the weekend
She said she need a hundred just to begin
Shawty wet, but she ain't a sea fish
Niggas stand in line for the pretest

[Chorus]
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Oh Lord
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Oh Lord, Lord, Lord
Oh Lord, Lord, Lord

[Verse 2]
Make your girl give me that turtle neck
Stomach flat like "Where that girdle at?"
Hundred K can't fit where your purses at
Hundred bill come through the mail like where them purses at?
Hundred bitches boolin' on the dock
I done spend two hundred on the clock
Don't think I'm a jay when I wear rocks
Minks on the floor, I ain't need no socks

[Bridge]
They wanna take it there
They wanna what?
What they want?
They wanna take it there
Come on, come on already

[Chorus]
Oh Lord, oh Lord

[Verse 1]
Wave after wave
Wishes unspoken
Talks like a blowtorch
Palms out and frozen

[Verse 2]
Who said it's easy?
Language is losing
I swallow the steam
And claim to be stupid

[Chorus 1]
Nails on the threshold
Moon free, don't make me the king of you

[Verse 3]
Past is a point
Behind the horizon
Bottom of the flame
Burning the garden

[Chorus 2]
Smiling on the threshold
Moon free, don't make me the king of you
Well, I'm a soldier for you frightened
Climbing, don't make me the king of you

[Verse 4]
Wave after wishes
My boon companion
Talks to the frost
But who will cheer the champion?
Kids with guns, kids with guns
Taking over but it won't be long
They mesmerized, skeletons
Kids with guns, kids with guns
Easy does it, easy does it
They got something to say no to
Drinking out

Drinking out

Doesn't make sense to
But it won't be long
'Cause kids with guns, kids with guns
Easy does it, easy does it
They got something to say no to
And they're turning us into monsters
Turning us into fire, turning us into monsters

Alone in the zone of the sad
Where no one gives a zig to the zag

I never let you rot
I'll never bet you don't know
Some might glisten the knot
I'll never let it show

Know when I'm towin' the drag
Where no one gives a zig to the zag
Oh

I might have to let you rot
I'm sad to let you go
I can't remember the night
I know what I'll never know
No one tells me how to behave
I'm mowing and I'm growing the grave

No one tells me how to be saved
I'm growing 'til I go to my grave
I
I'll never let you rot
I'll never bet you don't know
Some might glisten the knot
I'll never let it show

I'll going to let it rot
You'll never guess what's below
Some might glisten the knot
I'll never let it show
Ha-ah-ah, a shallow tribe is born
Ah-ah-ah, a kid counterpart
Now-ow-ow, he hollowed out his heart
Ah-ah-ah, oh, now he wants

More than we have
More than there is
More than we have
More that there is
More than exists

Ah-ah-ah, a sewer watch was shown
Ah-ah-ah, only ten episodes
Ah-ah-ah, it's everything I feel
Ah-ah-ah, in a mask of mirrors

More than I have
More than there is
More than I have
More than I can give
Wants more than I have
More than there is
More than I have
More that there is
More that exists

[Chorus]

You claim you still care for me
But your heart and soul needs to be free
Now that you've got your freedom
You wanna still hold on to me
You don't want me for yourself
So let me find somebody else
Hey, hey, hey
Why don't cha be a man about it and set me free
Now you don't care a thing about me
You're just using me
(You know it, you know it, you know it, you know it)
Get out, get out of my life
And let me sleep at night (I want to sleep at night)

[Verse 1: Brendan Reilly]
I can't stop
Whether you know or not
I ain't strong
And it's something in you that I'm dependent on
Worth a shot
Even though I've lost the plot
I know it's wrong
But it's something in you that I'm dependent on

[Refrain: Brendan Reilly]
Not going out tonight
Stay home until daylight
I'm hanging on for my life
I know myself far too well
Set myself up to fail
Is that what the future entails?

[Pre-Chorus: Brendan Reilly]
You give nothing to me
Still why do you feel like someone I need
I've been thinkin' 'bout us
And I've given enough
With you here by my side
It seems like I can't do anything right
I've been thinkin' 'bout us
And I've given enough

[Chorus: Brendan Reilly]
Every day, every day, every day, every day
Anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains

[Verse 2: Brendan Reilly]
Such a shame
Time for me to make a change
With what you've shown
Maybe you're just another stepping stone
Lost my name
Trying to put out this flame
I don't know
Maybe you're just another stepping stone

[Refrain: Brendan Reilly]
Not going out tonight
Stay home until daylight
I'm hanging on for my life
I know myself far too well
Set myself up to fail
Is that what the future entails?

[Pre-Chorus: Brendan Reilly]
You give nothing to me
Still why do you feel like someone I need
I've been thinkin' 'bout us
And I've given enough

And I've given enough

[Chorus: Brendan Reilly]
Every day, every day, every day, every day
Anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains
Every day, every day, every day, every day
Anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains
Every day, every day, every day, every day
Anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Feels like I'm movin' mountains
It feels like I'm movin' mountains
Every day, every day, every day, every day
Anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Feels like I'm movin' mountains

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Woo)
Metro in this bitch with me, nigga (Chopsquad)
Chop on the beat, you know what I'm sayin'? We gon' turn up for 'em
Guess what

[Chorus]
My whole life, I liked to gang bang, ayy
Chief Keef a nigga, we bang bang, whoa
I love them, they love me, we tango
They help me stack these chips like Pringles
This weed I smoke's no joke, this drink I drink's no joke
Young Thug rank ain't no joke, my old lady ain't no joke
YSL ain't no joke, no joke, no joke, no joke
I swear it's not a joke, no joke, no joke, no joke, I swear, I swear, I swear

[Verse 1]
Hey, you got them racks, Young Thugga there
Plus I got more power than a damn electric chair
Looked her in her eyes and now she clashin' our dope here
I'm gettin' stoned, that's why I'm wearin' summer gear
Shoot his ass in the face, leave his ass by the lake, no trace, no case
30 bands right below my waist
You can touch like a board, I ain't hit a sweepstakes though
After all them eats, better eat off my plate, pasos by the caseload
The big homie, he got you, Mexico with Maceo
Alright, I'm ridin' 'round town and put my hands down
If that's a nigga from your crew then put his hands down
Better watch his ass, better watch his ass
'Cause if you let this shit pass, your career ain't gon' last

[Chorus]
My whole life, I liked to gang bang, ayy
Chief Keef a nigga, we bang bang, whoa
I love them, they love me, we tango
They help me stack these chips like Pringles
This weed I smoke's no joke, this drink I drink's no joke
Young Thug rank ain't no joke, my old lady ain't no joke
YSL ain't no joke, no joke, no joke, no joke
I swear it's not a joke, no joke, no joke, no joke, I swear, I swear, I swear

[Verse 2]
Fuck all y'all niggas, 'cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck my bitch 'cause I'm down with these bitches, hey
I'm gettin' 'round with these bitches
I'm down for my nigga, ayy
My ice like a cooler, I got on a Franck Muller
Act tough and I'll shoot ya, pourin' out Cris, no Luda
Trunk of my car look like a Buddha
Catch ya bitch and recruit her
Brush ya hair for oodles and noodles
Like Shawty Lo, I'm foolish
Got her titties down like she work at Hooters
Bangin' red like Freddie Krueger
'Bout to open the door for my shawty
Gas tank on E, no 40
AP look kinda sporty, sheesh

[Chorus]
My whole life, I liked to gang bang, ayy
Chief Keef a nigga, we bang bang, whoa
I love them, they love me, we tango
They help me stack these chips like Pringles
This weed I smoke's no joke, this drink I drink's no joke
Young Thug rank ain't no joke, my old lady ain't no joke
YSL ain't no joke, no joke, no joke, no joke
I swear it's not a joke, no joke, no joke, no joke, I swear, I swear, I swear

[Verse 1]
Ooh, every day you make me cry, girl
I cry too much
And today you say goodbye, girl
It's just too much

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, I swallowed each and every lie
That you gave to me
Where lies the man that I was
And the future that could never be?

[Chorus]
Tomorrow every one gonna know me better
And tomorrow every one gonna drink my wine
And tomorrow every one gonna read my letter
And my story of love and a love that could never be mine

[Verse 2]
Ooh ask you to be my wife, girl
You were playing
Now I ask you where is my life, girl?
You were saying

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, I swallowed each and every lie
That you gave to me
Where lies the man that I was
And the future that could never be?

[Outro]
Tomorrow every one gonna know me better
And tomorrow every one gonna drink my wine
And tomorrow every one gonna read my letter
And my story of love and a love that could never be mine

Tomorrow every one gonna know me better
And tomorrow every one gonna drink my wine
And tomorrow every one gonna read my letter
And my story of love and a love that could never be mine

[Verse 1]
I can think of younger days when living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow
But I was never told about the sorrows

[Chorus]
And, how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?
How can you mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again

[Verse 2]
I can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
We could never see tomorrow
No one said a word about the sorrow

[Chorus]
And how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?
And how can you mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again

[Bridge]
La la la la la la, la la la la
La la la la la la, la la la la

[Outro]
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again
Da da da da
Da da da da, da da da da da, da

[Chorus]
I O, I I I I I I O, I O
I O, I I I I I I O, I O
I O, I I I I I I O, I O
I O, I I I I I I O, I O

[Verse 1]
You know I love getting up in the morning
When the sun first strikes the trees
All the morning birds that sing above
Still bring back memories

Of a girl who stood beside me
When the rights I did were wrong (wrong)
But she went back down the river
Just when I thought I could be strong
When I thought I could be strong, so I sing

[Bridge]
I O, I I I I I I O, I O
I O, I I I I I I O, I O

[Verse 2]
She never told me why she left me
But the letter said goodbye (bye)
Now my mornings are for wondering
And my nights to reason why

Why a stranger comes to steal the love
Of a girl I had to hold
But she went back down the river
Just when I thought I could be strong
When I thought I could be strong, so I sing

[Chorus - Var.1]
I O, I I I I I I O, I O
I sing, I O, I I I I I I O, I O
I sing, I O, I I I I I I O, I O

[Outro]
I O, I I I I I I O, I O
I O, I I I I I I O, I O
I O, I I I I I I O, I O
I O, I I I I I I O, I O
Wish I could write songs about anything other than death
But I can't go to bed without drawing the red, shaving off breaths;
Each one so heavy, each one so cumbersome
Each one a lead weight hanging between my lungs
Spilling my guts, sweat on a microphone, breaking my voice
Whenever I'm alone with you, can't talk but
"Isn't this weather nice? Are you okay?"
Should I go somewhere else and hide my face?
A sprinter learning to wait
A marathon runner, my ankles are sprained
A marathon runner, my ankles are sprained
Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro: Future & DJ Khaled]
Nigga that just some shit you don't do (don't do)
That just some shit you don't do (yeah!)
DJ Khaled!
I fucked your hoe inside a Wraith nigga, I fucked...

[Hook: Future]
I’m just blowing on dirty, I’m just blowing on dirty

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
O!
My A1s, my A1s, make one call them K's come
My young niggas, got young niggas ..

[Verse 1]
Orchestrate the shallow pink refrigerator drone
Carried in the shadows almost bone
Everyone wastes my time

[Verse 2]
The moment that you thought would murder motions you wait
Every apprehension alien, ache, ah
Everyone wastes my time

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody goes
I'm, I'm lonely

[Chorus]
I sleep underneath
A picture that I keep of you next to me
I realize we're magnetized

[Verse 3]
Orchestrate the shallow pink refrigerator drone
Carried in the shadows, ah
Everyone wastes my time

[Chorus]
I sleep underneath
A picture that I keep of you next to me
I realize we're magnetized
I realize we're magnetized

[Outro]
Realize we're magnetized
Realize we're magnetized
So-so and you don't really care
Stand alone and you're there all day
Some would say you're never really there
Although you still take up space
I know I know and you know that I know
It's a power play

I, I won't recognize you
I won't recognize you
Anymore

So-so and you don't really care
Stand alone and you're there all day
Some would say you're never really there
Although you still take up space
I know I know and you know that I know
It's a power play

And I won't, atone take some wild bile wicked
Entrees over chant-lace fade
I'm on a cold scope, raking down
Where's our receiver?
Oh, look on the phone
And you can say what you want
Or I'll say what you want
Why turn the tape, undertake a weak wall
Summon the stone
I advocate aiming for the weak wall
Summon the stone
And you can say what you want
But you don't know what you want
I'll say what you want

Now I'll say
All I will say

I, I won't recognize you
I won't recognize you
Anymore

[Verse 1]
Alright
At least you cried
A point of pride
Has torn in two
What was we
Where we meets you
From where we end
To where do I begin

[Verse 2]
We're so alone
We're never alone
Forever in debt
To the stomach I get
When things can't be known
Our paths overgrown
From where we end
To where do I begin

[Verse 3]
Why can't we tell
When we're in hell?
Why can't I say something
To make you well?
When things can't be seen
Confined within the dream
From where we end
To where do I begin

[Verse 4]
From what was left behind
To you're my friend
I won't ever, ever, ever
Fall apart like that again
From where we are
To where do I begin
Somehow
A satellite
Can of light
It's so red

Unbottle the halo, a satellite
Can chains change any failure
When all along

Someone can change it, follow on
Sometimes, I don't hate it lately
What I don't know I'm gonna bleed it away
Reunite
The dynamite
I'll catch it all and reunite
Dynamite, oh how high
I'm more moved by the maybe, it's ok
But you can't sing what you can't give away

I've come all this way to hold your hand
I became a calendar while I was waiting
I, I won't live any what you can't give it away
I, I won't miss any what I'm giving away
Don't wanna go and I don't wanna stay
You satellite
You satellite
You satellite

[Verse 1]
I never held your gaze
I never know my place
Oh, I stare at the eyes
Starin' at my face
It always ends in a tie
There is no knitting the divide
I cry at the joke explained

[Chorus]
Ah, but if I had known, if I had known
If I had known, I would have never believed

[Verse 2]
I never smoked my chain
Whoever measures the crest
Ah, they can have my broken chest
It's a staring contest
In a hall of mirrors
I sweat tears, but I don't ever cry

[Chorus]
Ah, if I had known, if I had known
If I had known, I would have never believed

[Verse 3]
I never knelt at the news
My parrot perished in the pews
I climb back into the yolk
It always ends in a tie
There is no knitting the divide
I cry at the joke explained

[Chorus]
Ah, if I had known, if I had known
If I had known, I would have never believed

[Outro]
I would have never believed
I would have never believed
Come on, listen to the weed whistle way
I belong to the stars in the day
I ran away eternal instigator
I was old

I remember the Milky Way, why?
I belong to the stars in the sky

I need your love

I need your time

When everything's wrong

You make it right

I feel so high

I come alive

I need to be free with you tonight

I need your love

I need your love

I take a deep breath every time I pass your door

I know you're there but I can't see you anymore
And that's the reason you're in the dark

I've been a stranger ever since we fell apart

I feel so helpless here

Watch, my eyes are filled with fear

Tell me, do you feel the same?

Hold me in your arms again

I need your love

I need your time

When everything's wrong

You make it right

I feel so high

I come alive

I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love

I need your love

Now I'm dreaming, will ever find you now?

I walk in circles but I'll never figure out

What I mean to you, do I belong?

I try to fight this but I know I'm not that strong

And I feel so helpless here

Watch my eyes are filled with fear

Tell me do you feel the same

Hold me in your arms again

I need your love

I need your time

When everything's wrong
You make it right

I feel so high

I come alive

I need to be free with you tonight

I need your love

I need your love

All the years

All the times

You havee never been to blame

And now my eyes are open

And now my heart is closing

And all the tears

All the lies

All the waste

I've been trying to make it change

And now my eyes are open

I need your love

I need your time

When everything's wrong

You make it right

I feel so high

I come alive

I need to be free

[Verse 1]
Robert's got a quick hand
He'll look around the room, he won't tell you his plan
He's got a rolled cigarette
Hanging out his mouth, he's a cowboy kid
Yeah, he found a six-shooter gun
In his dad's closet, in the box of fun things
I don't even know what
But he's coming for you, yeah, he's coming for you

[Hook]
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet

[Verse 2]
Daddy works a long day
He be coming home late, and he's coming home late
And he's bringing me a surprise
'Cause dinner's in the kitchen and it's packed in ice
I've waited for a long time
Yeah, the sleight of my hand is now a quick-pull trigger
I reason with my cigarette
Then say, "Your hair's on fire, you must've lost your wits, yeah?"

[Hook]
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet

You better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks

And your heart beat

It let's me know you feel the same

I can hold you

Keep you safe until you fall asleep

Never worry

Cause I can give you what you need

Now everything I do

Is all for loving you

Is not something that we're used to
No other way to say

I need you everyday

And now I'm gonna change my ways

And it's a part of you I never wanna lose

I'd do anything you want me to

Like any other day

I know I'll find a way

And if ever I'm alone, you say

I'll be thinking about you

I'll be thinking about you

I'll be thinking about you

I'll be thinking about you

(Repeat)
In a moment

I know that everything can change

My life will never be the same

You're the only one that's making sense to me

When I close my eyes you're the one I see

There's no other way

I can ever be without you babe

Now everything I do

Is all for loving you

Is not something that we're used to

No other way to say

I need you everyday

And now I'm gonna change my ways
And it's a part of you I never wanna lose

I'd do anything you want me to

Like any other day

I know I'll find a way

And if ever I'm alone, you say

I'll be thinking about you

I'll be thinking about you

I'll be thinking about you

I'll be thinking about you

It's all gonna be okay
It's all gonna be okay
It's all gonna be okay
I'll be waiting for you

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Well, tell me is it wrong?
Wrong for me to say this?
That our relationships been rough for a long time
Well baby, do you care?
Care about my heart, babe?
Acting like it's always you
Baby girl, I want to make you
I wanna make you mine

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
It's all gonna be okay
It's all gonna be okay
It's all gonna be okay
I'll be waiting for you
Baby, if you take my hand
We can never go nowhere
Can't you feel the love in the air
Oh! You know I got you baby
Tell me, Do you love me?
Do you need me? Do you want me back?
'Cause I got you
And I'll never let you go-go-go
Tell me, Do you love me?
Do you need me? Do you want me back?
'Cause I got you
And I'll never let you go-go-go

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Well I don't wanna do this
No, I don't wanna do this
You coming here sayin' that you only wanna be friends
I don't wanna do this
No, I don't wanna do this
When you're down for the week
But then you're gone for the weekend

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
It's all gonna be okay
It's all gonna be okay
It's all gonna be okay
I'll be waiting for you
Baby, if you take my hand
We can never go nowhere
Can't you feel love in the air
Oh! You know I got you baby
Tell me, Do you love me?
Do you need me? Do you want me back?
'Cause I got you
And I'll never let you go-go-go
Tell me, Do you love me?
Do you need me? Do you want me back?
'Cause I got you
And I'll never let you go-go-go

[Verse 3: Jaden Smith]
So when the lights turn off
And this love don't last
There is one question I would ask
Is it cause when we first started, we was movin' really fast
It is cause it was blurry and we worried by the past
Well now baby girl, I'm starting fresh
Every time I see you like we never met
Better yet, Imma get a jet, we fly to Paris, on the wheel like it was Ferris
Baby girl you who I cherish
Don't get worried about your parents
We gon' chill
And girl I'll be your biggest crush
When I walk up in the room
Girl, You know I see you blush, hush!
Girl, I know you feel this lust
Girl, you always on my side, cause you know that, that's a must, yes us

[Post-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Tell me, Do you love me?
Do you need me? Do you want me back?
'Cause I got you
And I'll never let you go-go-go
Tell me, Do you love me?
Do you need me? Do you want me back?
'Cause I got you
And I'll never let you go-go-go

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
It's all gonna be okay
It's all gonna be okay
It's all gonna be okay
I'll be waiting for you
Baby, if you take my hand
Baby, if you take my hand
We can never go nowhere
Can't you feel love in the air
Oh! You know I got you baby

[Verse 1: Barry Gibb]
I stumble in the night
Never really knew what it would've been like
You're no longer there to break my fall
The heartache over you
I'd give it everything but I couldn't live through
I never saw the signs
You're the last to know when love is blind

All the tears and the turbulent years
When I would not wait for no one
Didn't stop, take a look at myself
See me losing you

[Chorus]
When the lonely heart breaks, it's the one that forsakes
It's the dream that we stole
And I'm missing you more than the fire that will roar
A hole in my soul
For you it's good-bye, for me it's to cry
For whom the bell tolls, for me

[Verse 2]
Seen you in a magazine
A picture at a party where you shouldn't have been
Hanging on the arm of someone else
I'm still in love with you
Won't you come back to your little boy blue
I've come to feel inside
This precious love was never mine

Now I know but a little too late
That I could not live without you
In the dark or the broad daylight
I promise I'll be there

[Chorus]
When the lonely heart breaks, it's the one that forsakes
It's the dream that we stole
And I'm missing you more than the fire that will roar
A hole in my soul
For you it's good-bye, for me it's to cry
For whom the bell tolls

[Verse 3]
Now I know there'll be times like this
When I couldn't reach out to no one
Am I never gonna find someone who knows me like you do
Are you leaving me a helpless child
When it took so long to save me fight the Devil and the deep blue sea
I'll follow you anywhere, I promise I'll be there

[Chorus] 

[x2]
When the lonely heart breaks, it's the one that forsakes
It's the dream that we stole
And I'm missing you more than the fire that will roar
There's a hole in my soul
For you it's good-bye, for me it's to cry
For whom the bell tolls

[Outro]
When the lonely heart breaks, it's the one that forsakes
It's the dream that we stole
And I'm missing you more than the fire that will roar
There's a hole in my soul
The Haunting

A Letter

To rappers from a rapper...simply write your own rhymes as much as you can if you are able. Ghostwriting, or borrowing lines, or taking suggestions from the room has always been in rap and will always be in rap. It is nothing to go crazy over or be offended about unless you are someone who postures him or herself on the importance of authenticity and tries to portray that quality to your fans or the public at large. Then we might have a problem. Some of the most pivotal moments in rap have been ghostwritten verses. This leads to a bigger point. Rapping is not an easy thing to do. It's takes years of work and trial and error to master some of its finer points. Respect from other MC's comes in many formats. Sales, live performances, realness etc but the one thing that is the most important is the raps themselves at least in the eyes of other serious rappers. The phrase "I'm not a rapper" gets thrown around as if it's a badge of honor. And that's fine. If rap is a side hustle for you or just a come up then by all means may the force be with you. But I know a lot of MC's where rap is the first love and the first thing they think about when they wake up and the last thing they think about when they go to sleep. Rappers who pursue the art form with this level of intention may not become rich and famous off selling their raps to a wide audience but that has never been an accepted metric to begin with in terms of quality or level of skill. The vast majority of rappers will never sell 100 records in their lifetimes let alone millions. But that's not the point, the point is that what pursuing the craft gives us in terms of the intangibles is something that record sales or fame could never represent. We achieve a mastery of language and poetics that competes on the highest levels of discourse across the entirety of human history. We express ourselves creatively and attain a sense of liberation and self-esteem via this sacred mode of creation and communication


Modern Radio and the commercial realm of music has injured rap. It set up ambiguous rules and systems for success that don't take into consideration the quality and skill of the rappers craft. It redefined rap as just being a beat driven hook with some words in between and an entire generation has surrendered to chasing the format instead of chasing the art form. While mastering any format should be the pursuit of any self-respecting rapper including the commercial format it must be kept clear that it is just one of many formats and that you should strive to master all of them. The art form is kept alive and progressive in the activities of the tens of thousands of rappers around the world who are everyday trying to think of that next witty bar. Trying to put that crazy verse together while at work. Trying to find that word that rhymes with catapult so they can finish off that vivid story rap about their childhood. Meek Mill struck a nerve accusing Drake of having a ghostwriter and the entire rap world reacted on all sides of the fence because rap is alive. It's active and it feels. Its rules and traditions are vibrant and responsive. I enjoy both these brothers music and find inspiration and appreciation from both of them. I remember being in Toronto at Goodfoot years ago and it was a stack of CD's on the counter and the guy behind the counter was like "Lupe you gotta take this CD. It's my mans mixtape." I didn't really pay it any mind I took it to the car and looked it over and just kind of set it aside focused on other things. I vividly remember saying "what kind of rap name is Drake?" The rest is history. Once while in Philly I went to do an interview in a shabby and very hood basement studio complex. I peeked into one of the rooms and it was this tall kid with his shirt off bouncing up and down in the booth with an energy that was electric. I gave him my regards. He gave them back. I think I mentioned something about him cutting his dreads. As I left I remember him rapping something about being a boss. The rest is history. At the end of the day, for better or worse, rap is alive even if some of its greatest moments are written by ghosts

Robert's got a quick hand
He'll look around the room, he won't tell you his plan
He's got a rolled cigarette
Hanging out his mouth, he's a cowboy kid
Yeah, he found a six-shooter gun
In his dad's closet, in the box of fun things
I don't even know what
But he's coming for you, yeah, he's coming for you

Southside boy in the wild wild west
Came up a G so I while a best
Wanna test the waters you can be my guest
If you goin too deep imma lay you to rest

It's assinine
How I blast the nine
And the cast is tryin
And pacifyin
Rapper firin
Fo' blast the iron
Thrash the ass
Like fast is lyin'

So hear the roar when I come your way
With my game in hand but I ain't come to play
I got a job to do it's gettin' done today
If it ain't yo business then get out' my way
My gun is cold but my head is steamin'
You done me wrong it ain't have no reason
You changed the story like they change the season
Didn't think I'd show up and start the squeezin'

Nigga this is ready for the shit to get hot
I ain't leavin' this bitch just about to get shot
But it count just cause I'm in the resid

[?] I got
Who've you try to live get the fuck about the lot

Man, it's about to get bad
Off in the upstrap
But finna bus gad
If you a tough catch
You better bus back
Or imma touch bags
So put the stars back
But thats enough of that

Shoot shit then they get killed
Try to act tough till they see the steel
The rubber pop off till they crack that seal
Pullers rotate like a kill eight wheel

Stone cold killer from the C.H.I
They fuck a Hollywood then you stay or die
So you hoes better really vacate the place
'Fore I straight hate and I AK your face

[Verse 1: M.I.A.]
I fly like paper, get high like planes
If you catch me at the border I got visas in my name
If you come around here, I make 'em all day
I get one done in a second if you wait
I fly like paper, get high like planes
If you catch me at the border I got visas in my name
If you come around here, I make 'em all day
I get one done in a second if you wait
Sometimes I think sittin' on trains
Every stop I get to I'm clocking that game
Everyone's a winner, we're making our fame
Bona fide hustler making my name
Sometimes I think sittin' on trains
Every stop I get to I'm clocking that game
Everyone's a winner, we're making our fame
Bona fide hustler making my name

[Chorus: M.I.A. + Rye Rye]
All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot)
And a (click, ka-ching)
And take your money
All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot)
And a (click, ka-ching)
And take your money
All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot)
And a (click, ka-ching)

All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot)

[Verse 2: Rye Rye]
She's fly like paper, gets high like planes
Try to keep her from the U.S. but shes stronger than a gang
Well she's got a lot of fame, messing with the wrong name
I'm following her footsteps from the hood to the music game
My city on fire, ain't no need to put it out
Ain't about to set it up, 'cause I got fire in my mouth
And about to bring it out to the world
I want to touch the clouds, want to be a nature girl
I feel the rain and it's telling me to go far
I feel the pain and it's telling me the music calls
Should I stay? Should I go? I don't know, I'm kind of lost
But I'm aiming for success, I'm really sorry if you lost
Never take drugs but I'm highed up
All the music from my MC in the hood, growing up
It gets hard when you try to blow it up
So stressful, you say fuck it, you be like "I'm giving up"

[Chorus: M.I.A. + Rye Rye]
All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot)
And a (click, ka-ching)
And take your money
All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot)
And a (click, ka-ching)
And take your money
All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot)
And a (click, ka-ching)
And take your money
All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot)
And a (click, ka-ching)
And take your money

[Verse 3: Afrikan Boy]
I was at home, making my visa
Slipping on my government, yeah you know how it goes man
I'm fresh from Lagos, fresh from Nigeria
If I look angry it's 'cause someone stole my visa
If you walk into my kitchen you will see the white powder
I'll be by the cooker, whipping at you harder
Don't be alarmed I'm just cooking pounded yam
Afrikan Boy, I'll never be a drug dealer
I wrap and sell pepe in the markets of Abuja
I'm a legend, something like Jay Jay Okocha
My name is Olushola, I just set up my visa
I live every day like it's the first of October
The greatest hustler on earth I know is my mother
Like mother, like son, familiar like my father
Birds of the same flow share the same feather
I just want to make my dollar and my Naira

[Chorus: M.I.A. + Rye Rye]
All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot)
And a (click, ka-ching)
And take your money
All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot)
And a (click, ka-ching)
And take your money
All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot)
And a (click, ka-ching)
And take your money
All I wanna do is (gunshot, gunshot, gunshot, gunshot)

Third world democracy
Yeah, I've got more records than the K.G.B
So, uh, no funny business
Are you ready all?
Some, some, some I, some I murder
Some I, some I let go
Some, some, some I, some I murder
Some I, some I let go
Down on the West Coast, they got a sayin'
If you're not drinking, then you're not playing
But you got the music, you got the music in you, don't you?

Down on the West Coast, I get this feeling
Like it all could happen, that's why I'm leaving
You for the moment, you for the moment, boy blue, yeah, you

You're falling hard, I push away, I'm feeling hot to the
Touch
You say you miss me and I wanna say, "I miss you so much"
But something keeps me really quiet, I'm alive, I'm a lush
Your love, your love, your love

I can see my baby swinging, his Parliament's on fire and his
Hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing, "Ooh baby, ooh baby, I'm in
Love"
I can see my sweet boy swaying, he's crazy , la la
On the balcony and I'm saying, "Move baby, move baby, I'm in
Love"
(I'm in love) I'm in love (I'm in love)
(Mic check, one two, two, two, keep it, girl)

Down on the West Coast, they got their icons
The silver starlets, their queens of Saigons
And you got the music, you got the music in you, don't you?

Down on the West Coast, they love their movies
Their Golden Gods and rock 'n' roll groupies
And you got the music, you got the music in you, don't you?

You push it hard, I pull away, I'm feeling hot and on fire
I guess that no one ever really made me feel that much
Higher
, boy, it's you I desire
Your love, your love, your love

I can see my baby swinging, his Parliament's on fire and his
Hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing, "Ooh baby, ooh baby, I'm in
Love"
I can see my sweet boy swaying, he's crazy , la la
On the balcony and I'm saying, "Move baby, move baby, I'm in
Love"

I can see my baby swinging, his Parliament's on fire and his
Hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing, "Ooh baby, ooh baby I'm in
Love"
I can see my sweet boy swaying, he's crazy , la la
On the balcony and I'm saying, "Move baby, move baby, I'm in
Love"
I'm in love, I'm in love

Calvin Harris x Example - We'll Be Coming Back

We took it all apart

But I'm wishing I'd stayed

In the back room something I heard you say

We didn't want to call it too early

Now it seems a world away

But I miss the thing, are we ever gonna feel the same?

Standing in the light till it's over

Out of our minds

Someone had to draw a line

We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day

I don't even care if I know you

Out of our minds

Got to leave it all behind

We'll be coming back

We'll be coming back for you one day

You can see it from afar

We were riding that wave

Blinded by the lights, and it's something not great

We didn't want to call it too early

Now it seems a world away

But I miss the thing, are we ever gonna feel the same?

Standing in the light till it's over
Out of our minds

Someone had to draw a line

We'll be coming back for you one day

We'll be coming back for you one day

I don't even care if I know you

Out of our minds

Got to leave it all behind

We'll be coming back for you one day

We'll be coming back for you one day

Gonna rise, gonna fall, getting pulled apart

And we all do it all cause it stole our hearts

Gonna light up the skies, or ignore the stars

And we all do it all cause it stole our hearts
Standing in the light till it's over

Out of our minds

Someone had to draw a line

We'll be coming back for you one day

We'll be coming back for you one day

I don't even care if I know you

Out of our minds

Got to leave it all behind

We'll be coming back for you one day

We'll be coming back for you one day
I'm coming 'round
And now my vision is so clear
If I could change my state of mind
Then I would disappear

The love I get from you
Is something I can't change
And I could let you slip away
Without a second glance

Why can't I realize
I'm fighting for my life?
Why can't I realize
I'm fighting for my life?

This is like a flashback
This is like a dream
This is like all the things you can fit
Inside a memory

This is like a flashback
This is like a dream
This is like all the things you can fit
Inside a memory
This is like a flashback, flashback
This is like a flashback, flashback

Why can't I realize
I'm fighting for my life?
Why can't I realize
I'm fighting for my life?

This is like a flashback
This is like a dream
This is like all the things you can fit
Inside a memory

This is like a flashback
This is like a dream
This is like all the things you can fit
Inside a memory
Ask for money, and get advice

Ask for advice, get money twice

I'm from the Dirty, but that chico nice

Ya'll call it a moment, I call it life

One day when the light is glowing

I'll be in my castle golden

But until the gates are open

I just want to feel this moment

Oh oh...

I just want to feel this moment

Oh oh...
I just want to feel this moment

Mr. Worldwide

Christina Aguilera

Oye mamita

I just want to feel this moment

Reporting live, from the tallest building in Tokyo

Long way from them hard ways, filled with zoes & oye's

They count it always, 305 all day

Now baby we can parlay, or baby we can party

She reads books, especially 'bout red rooms & tie ups

I got her hooked, 'cause she seen me in a suit with the red tie tied up

Christian Gris nice to meet ya, but time is money

Only difference is I own it, now let's stop time and enjoy this moment
One day when the light is glowing

I'll be in my castle golden

But until the gates are open

I just want to feel this moment

Oh oh...

I just want to feel this moment

Oh oh...

I just want to feel this moment

I see the future but live for the moment

Makes sense don't it? Ha

Now make dollars, I mean billions

I'm a genius, I mean brilliant

The streets are what schooled him
And made him slicker than slick rick the ruler

I've lost a lot and learned a lot

I'm far from cheap

I break down companies with all my peeps

Baby we can travel the world

And I can give you and all you can see

Time is money

Only difference is I own it

Like a stop watch let's stop time

And enjoy this moment, dale

One day when the light is glowing

I'll be in my castle golden

But until the gates are open

I just want to feel this moment

Oh oh...

I just want to feel this moment

Oh oh...

I just want to feel this moment

Oh oh...

I just want to feel this moment

Oh oh...

I just want to feel this moment

We float before the sea at dusk

In heavy mist, in glitter dust

I smile before I want to

I smile because you won't do

We sip the wind through lips of lust

And out it comes, warm wisps of love

I smile because I want to

I smile because you want to

Put the flowers in your hair

Wrap your tendrils round my chest

I smile because I want to
I am your boy

Shake my little soul for you now, darling

And I settle up into a world of noise

I'm a man of many tricks and tools and joy

With a battery of guilt on which to poise

Down by the shore, a funny foe

Who bit my wings and ate them whole

You left before I come to

You left before I come to

We took to heels into the trees

I hit my head and bit the leaves

You left before I come to

You left before I
Shake my little soul for you now, darling

And I settle up into a world of noise

I'm a man of many tricks and tools and joy

With a battery of guilt on which to poise

Shanks of slate fall to the beach

Wrapped up in life in ultra greens

Pools teem with tiny feet

In worlds of tired anenomies

You left before I got to

You left before I got to

You left before I got to

You left before I

Shook the flowers from your hair
Run to me and kiss my hand

I'm dead before I

I'm dead before I

Shake my little soul for you then, darling

And I settle up into a world of noise

I'm a man of many tricks and tools and joy

With a battery of guilt on which to poise

Shake my little soul for you now, darling

And I settle up into a world of noise

I'm a man of many tricks and tools and toys

With a battery of guilt on which to poise

I smile because I want to, I smile because I want to

I smile because I want to, I smile because I want to

I smile because I want to, I smile because I want to

I smile because I want to, I smile because I want to

Hey
Counterfeit, counterfeit
That's what you're shouting at me
I could run but I'd sooner have this
And I make her bleed
Lick the blood stain from your finger
Say what do you see?
Remind you that whatever you get is
What you want it to be

You get a feeling, that's what you choose
And I was told there was not a minute to lose
So if you're waiting, jump out your skin
To find a cure for whatever state you're in
I tell my good friends, get out the waY
Of all the lightning hitting the trees today
We get a thrill from clapping our hands
We find the nearest girl and ask her to dance

I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Weekend, weekend, weekend
Coming back, coming back
To a place where I never knew
Pushing knobs, pushing faders
But I don't know what they do
This reflection in my mirror
Reminds me of you
When I tilt it towards the sunlight
You fall out of view

You get a feeling, that's what you choose
And I was told there was not a minute to lose
So if you're waiting, jump out your skin
To find a cure for whatever state you're in
I tell my good friends, get out the way
Of all the lightning hitting the trees today
We get a thrill from clapping our hands
We find the nearest girl and ask her to dance

I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Weekend, weekend, weekend
I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Weekend, weekend, weekend
I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Weekend, weekend, weekend
I put on my shoes and I'm ready for the weekend
Weekend, weekend, weekend

If I told you

That this couldn't get better baby

And your heart beat

It let's me know you feel the same

I can hold you

Keep you safe until you fall asleep

Never worry

Cause I can give you what you need

Now everything I do

Is all for loving you

Is not something that we're used to
No other way to say

I need you everyday

And now I'm gonna change my ways

And it's a part of you I never wanna lose

I'd do anything you want me to

Like any other day

I know I'll find a way

And if ever I'm alone, you say

I'll be thinking about you

I'll be thinking about you

I'll be thinking about you

I'll be thinking about you

(Repeat)
In a moment

I know that everything can change

My life will never be the same

You're the only one that's making sense to me

When I close my eyes you're the one I see

There's no other way

I can ever be without you babe

Now everything I do

Is all for loving you

Is not something that we're used to

No other way to say

I need you everyday

And now I'm gonna change my ways
And it's a part of you I never wanna lose

I'd do anything you want me to

Like any other day

I know I'll find a way

And if ever I'm alone, you say

I'll be thinking about you

I'll be thinking about you

I'll be thinking about you

I'll be thinking about you

Your girl just kissed a girl

Surfboard and high tide

'Cause I'm swoll up
So that birthday cake get a cobra
Buggati for real, I'm cold bruh
That auto-biography rover
Got the key to my city it's over
It's no thots, only Anna Kournikova's

I know what you came here to see
If you're a freak, then ya coming home with me
And I know what you came here to do
Now bust it open let me see you get loose
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
And they already know me
It's going down for real
It's going down further than femurs
Girls get wetter than Katrina
Yeah my girl you never seen her
'Cause my tints by limousines
My touch is the Midas
We de-plus your man to minus
My team blowing on that slam
Make you cough-cough that's Bronchitis
Put your hands up
It's a stick up, no more makeup
Get that ass on the floor
Ladies put your lipstick up
Double entendre, double entendre
While you're hating I get money
Then I double up tonkers
I know what you came here to see
If you're a freak, then ya coming home with me
And I know what you came here to do
Now bust it open let me see you get loose
It's going down for real
It's going down for real

Couple weeks old, "Bugatti" done went gold

We the best, runnin' every summer in fact

Broward! Pussy I woke up in a new Bugatti Hold up, double M back in this bitch
Walk in the club with a MAC on my hip
Diamonds look like niggas be snappin a flick
Ballin' I blow fifty racks in the VIP

A new Mussolini in back of the six
I'm shittin' on rappers, these rappers is sick
Cause my homies got whips that these rappers ain't get
Cause we crackin' them bricks and I package the zip
And I'm switchin' my flow, I spit crack in this bitch
And I been hit your ho, now she back on my dick
But I get to the dough and get back at your bitch

Right, put it in the light
Nigga got ice but it don't look right
If a nigga buy a brick and it don't cook right
I'll whip that shit for a rack, sit tight
I got a bag full of tools and some yay to move
And all I want is money, leave the fame to you
I graduated out of gladiator school
So all I know is go like I'm trained to do
Right now, turn my Mazy pedal to the metal I'm ashin' out
I let the top down in my Phantom drop
Blowin', I'm high as an astronaut
When you see me, I'm cashin' out
Walked into Mercedes bought half the lot
You keep carrying on, you getting carried out
Cause I don’t take ass whoopins, just pass ‘em out
Is this worth getting blasted about?
No forreal, is it worth getting blasted about? Money conversation
Get so high, I be scrapin'
Got my eyes like a Asian
In my ride, like I'm racin'
In the sky, like a plane
It's Gang or die
Ain't no lames up in my circle
Ain't no ho shit in my eyes
Throwin' money in the air
Poppin' bands and let it fly
Where I'm from, you come up short
Pull that thing and let it fly
You know me, blow so much dank, think I'm Marley
Got so much ink on my body
Brought so much drink to the party

Excuse My French nigga, no France

All on my car stick, give her some hundreds she did
Like this, I'mma say this

If you got good pussy you should always have your rent paid
Choke on some bands if I'm not mistaken
Add up my outfit, fashion statement
This the school of hard knocks, graduation I'm sick of y'all niggas all talkin' crazy
Hottest nigga spittin' and they can't debate it
I didn't really know 2Pac or Big
But know the beast within'll reincarnate 'em
Fuck underrated, I'm constipated

You're now tuned into the fuckin' greatest
Ace Hood, congratulations
Say name one nigga that's rockin' with him

Tell all them critics to suck on the dick
Nigga

[Hook]
Call it what you want
Call it what you want
I said just call it what you want
Call it what you want

[Verse 1]
Yeah we're locked up in ideas
We like to label everything
Well I'm just gonna do here what I gotta do here
Cause I gotta keep myself free
You're ducking and moving just to hide your bruises from all your enemies
And I'm in the crossfire dodging bullets from your expectancies
Yeah yeah

[Pre-Hook]
We've got nothing to lose
You better run and hide
Yeah you've crossed the line
I've got a knife behind my back, just sayin
We've got nothing to prove
Your social guides give you swollen eyes
But what I've got can't be bought so you can just

[Hook]
Call it what you want
Call it what you want
I said just call it what you want
Call it what you want

[Verse 2]
You've taken your words and you take your judgments
And stick them onto everything
If it don't conform to what you were born into
Then you run the other way
You say, "now what's your style and who do you listen to?" Who cares?
Well that rat race ladder-climbing fake-face smile's got nothing on me

[Pre-Hook]
We've got nothing to lose
You better run and hide
Yeah you've crossed the line
I've got a knife behind my back, just sayin
We've got nothing to prove
Your social guides give you swollen eyes
But what I've got can't be bought so you can just

[Hook]
Call it what you want
Call it what you want
I said just call it what you want
Call it what you want

[Outro]
What you want
Call it what you want
You can call it what you want
What you want
Call it what you want
What you want
You can call it what you want

I said just call it what you want
Call it what you want
I said fuck them other niggas, cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, I ride for my niggas
I die for my niggas, nigga I hit em up

T Raww go stay Westside, killa cat pillar
No ceiling, probably worth 10 million
Poor nigga watch chilla, you ain't even gotta feel it
That's chin chinchilla flyer than a caterpillar
I sick my dogs at you, yeah
Then call the dog catcher, bitch
Spark the fire, no matches, yeah
So high just laughing, hah
Burners in the attic, they ain't know I had it
Shoot sporadic, fire automatic, pop the target
Driving backwards, I'm a hundred bill fanatic
Bring the static, make vows to the money, but I skipped marriage
Keep staring, rather die that nigga than live average, get you embarrassed
Thousand karats on my wheel let my kids inherit
Black card credit, told them I don't use debit
Nigga know that's my motto, I could do this shit forever so
Fuck them other niggas, cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, I ride for my niggas
I die for my niggas, talkin get you hit up

Fuck them other niggas, cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, I ride for my niggas
I die for my niggas, nigga I hit em up

We don't rock with them niggas anyway, fuck them
We'd ever caught them in the hood, we'd a stuck them
Things coming in, we get them off by the dozen
We about that action, you ain't about nothin'
Girl of your dream, I already had her
If it ain't my team, it don't really matter
Short stay, I'm only in town for the figures
Even when I'm up, I'm still down for my niggas
Need nothing else, don't concern me or worry me
Nah, I'mma ride 'til they burn me or bury me
Cause the truth is, niggas die every day
Heard about me, I hope you heard thoroughly
I don't switch sides, I just switch rides
Might just get a little head, let the bitch slide
Knowing that I can, knowing that I will
Far as the other side go, you know how I feel
Fuck them other niggas, cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, I ride for my niggas
I die for my niggas, talkin get you hit up

Fuck them other niggas, cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, I ride for my niggas
I die for my niggas, nigga I hit em up

You gotta watch your back
Stay strapped, be alert
Started as a young motherfucker doin' dirt
Walkin' through the streets wearin' jewels
Ain't got shit to lose
Gonna fuck up and bust young niggas with tools
The intricate designs of my lethal lines
Now time hard to find a job, easier to rob niggas
These days, motherfuckers talk shit
And turn snitch when you see 'em
They ain't talkin' 'bout shit
Westside
I keep a vest on my chest
Buck, buck, cops wanna hit me with the book
But I don't give a fuck
Government got a nigga feelin' stuck
While these same little sluts gettin' fucked
For a quick buck
Weed make my mind roam
All alone, ain't nothin' like tryin' to bone
Over the phone, in my mind I can see her naked
I can't take it
Got me shakin' at the thought that we can make it
I thought you knew
Get loaded, can't control it
Nigga, pass me the blunt and let me roll it
Then smoke it, sippin
Hennessy
Plottin' on my enemies
'Comin back twice as hard
Like, remember me
My hustle to my dyin' days
Niggas dyin' every day
And we celebrate with pain
Pourin' champagne
Drink politics, they wanna join my campaign
Worldwide, LA niggas screaming
Westside
Fuck them other niggas, cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, I ride for my niggas
I die for my niggas, talkin get you hit up

Fuck them other niggas, cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, cause I'm down for my niggas
Fuck them other niggas, I ride for my niggas
I die for my niggas, nigga I hit em up

[Intro: Mystikal]
Mmm! Mmm, mmm, mmm
Ooh-OOH!

[Chorus: Mystikal]
Shake it fast, but watch yourself
Shake it fast, show me what you're working with
Shake it fast, but watch yourself
Shake it fast

[Verse 1: Mystikal]
I came here with the mic in my hand
Don't make me leave here with my foot in yo'—be cool
And don't worry about how I'm ripping this
When I'm flipping what I'm kicking, that's just what I do
I'm effervescent and I'm off that crescent
Nastier than a full grown German Shepherd; you better keep stepping
They don't mess with me and they don't
Y'all can't catch me and they won't
Pay your fare, fix your hair, throw that
Got a Prada for my boot-knockers, and Donna for my babooski
You think I'm tricking? Well, I ain't trippin'
I'm buying if you got nice curves for your iceberg
Drinking Henn and acting like it do something to me
Hope this indecent proposal make you do something with me
Forget a dollar, girl, pick up fifty, mmm
Forget that coward, girl, you need a real
Off top the knick-a-boxers hurting me
Bend over, girl, show me what you're working with

[Chorus: Mystikal]
Shake it fast, but watch yourself
Shake it fast, show me what you're working with
But shake it fast, but watch yourself

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams, Mystikal]
Attention all y'all players and pimps (Shake it fast)
Right now in the place to be
I thought I told y'all dudes before
Y'all dudes can't mess with me (Watch yourself)
Now this ain't for no small booties
No sir 'cause that won't pass (Show me what you're working with)
But if you feel you got the biggest one
Then mama come shake it fast

[Chorus: Mystikal]
Shake it fast, but watch yourself
Shake it fast, show me what you're working with
But shake it fast, but watch yourself
Shake it fast, show me what you're working with

[Verse 2: Mystikal]
I like my women fire like CAYENNE!!
Chocolate and bowlegged, when I'm runnin' up behind her
Go 'head do your job, pop the lock, let the
For real, girl, don't lie, you know you wanna go back to my house
"The Man Right Chea" wanna get under that dress right there
You spicy cajun we gon' a good time over there
You better suck the head on them there crawfish
And you gotta bend all the way over to dance off this
Handle your business but I know you do it way better, you dead wrong
So if you talking 'bout it and they make noise when you pass by, girl
Get your fine self on the floor, this your song
Do your thing don't be scurred, 'cause you gon' get served
You get mine then you gon' get yours
'Bout to make you love it
Raise it up, show the G-string, hustle, hustle

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams, Mystikal]
Attention all y'all players and pimps (Shake it fast)
Right now in the place to be
I thought I told y'all dudes before
Y'all dudes can't mess with me (Watch yourself)
Now this ain't for no small booties
No sir 'cause that won't pass (Show me what you're working with)
But if you feel you got the biggest one
Then mama come shake it fast

[Chorus: Mystikal]
Shake it fast, but watch yourself
Shake it fast, show me what you're working with
But shake it fast, but watch yourself
Shake it fast, show me what you're working with

[Verse 3: Mystikal]
Stop your cryin', heifer, I don't need all that
I got a job for you, the braided-up pimp is back
Break them handcuffs, forget your man, move something
And if they ask you what you doing say, "Ooh, nuttin'"
And we been doing for the past two something
And I've been beating the stuffing up, not smooth loving
You can bet your bottom dollar, if it's fire
You gon' holla Michael Tyler
So don't act like you don't be backing that stuff up
Get your girl in the club, 'cause that's what you got back for
Wobble wobble, I'm infatuated
The girl work that thing like she making a baby
And I see that we gon' have to go to a quiet corner for just us two and
Don't worry about who looking, just keep on doing what you doing
'Cause a brother like me gon' get to work before I know the girl
Trick, what's happening? Let 'em see, show the world

[Pre-Chorus: Pharrell Williams, Mystikal]
Attention all y'all players and pimps (Shake it fast)
Right now in the place to be
I thought I told y'all dudes before
Y'all dudes can't mess with me (Watch yourself)
Now this ain't for no small booties
No sir 'cause that won't pass (Show me what you're working with)
But if you feel you got the biggest one
Then mama come shake it fast

[Chorus: Mystikal]
Shake it fast, but watch yourself
Shake it fast, show me what you're working with
But shake it fast, but watch yourself
Shake it fast, show me what you're working with
Shake it fast, but watch yourself
Shake it fast, show me what you're working with
But shake it fast, but watch yourself
Shake it fast, show me what you're working with

[Outro: Mystikal]
OOH-OOH! Good lawd!
You working with something
Hmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, woo
Girl I'm in love with you
This ain't the honeymoon
Past the infatuation phase
Right in the thick of love
At times we get sick of love
It seems like we argue every day
I know I misbehave
And you made your mistakes
And we both still got room left to grow
And though love sometimes hurts
I still put you first
And we'll make this thing work
But I think we should take it slow

We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
‘Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow
This time we'll take it slow
This ain't a movie no
No fairy tale conclusion y'all
It gets more confusing every day
Sometimes it's heaven sent
Then we head back to hell again
We kiss then we make up on the way
I hang up you call
We rise and we fall
And we feel like just walking away
As our love advances
We take second chances
Though it's not a fantasy
I still want you to stay

We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
‘Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow

Maybe we'll live and learn
Maybe we'll crash and burn
Maybe you'll stay, maybe you'll leave
Maybe you'll return
Maybe you'll never find
Maybe we won't survive
But maybe we'll grow
We never know, baby you and I
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go, yeah hey
‘Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow, hey hey
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
‘Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, slow
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow
This time we'll take it slow
Let's play black car, black Audemar
For the love of money I'mma die hard
Fuckin role model, tell these bitches that play your part
I blew off off one tape, got take it now, I'm a movie star

Phone calls, my language off
Old school like coolie high
Your bitch, she get sodomized
My money blink like lawyer's eyes
These niggas telling like all lies
Said they want beef but they French fries
I'm hot poppin, nigga deep fried
These bitches sweatin me, perspire

Tell a nigga: she want china, she will turn you out
Had a white bitch like no doubt
Busting nuts for 4 hours
I'm on the jet getting drugged out
Dro the face, her tongue out
I'm throwin money like paper routes
My flow hard like the workout
She eat pussy, cat down
Can't see me, back round
School niggas, cap gaw
Click clack, smoking cloud
Lumberjack, tall niggas
Paul Bunyon I wish you were
All my niggas like Tray Vonn
Ready to gut their hood

Ball hard, no fucking catch
My shit real, yo figures wax
Yo Rollie ain't Rolex
Like mankind get sucked next
We don't fuck with P90X
Cause all my niggas they do is flex
My car made for races
Like to fuck with rednecks

I'm on some different shit. Hop out then I pull up
Motherfuckin little Mickey icy like cooler
I don't need no help
Never fuck with no tutors
Talkin all that head, blow me and your medulla

T-Raww, I'm steppin out
Bill money I'm handing out
I ain't scared of yall niggas, Manny Pacquaio
Strip search, I pat her down
Wiz Khalifa, I'm smoking loud
Like ASAP I got a fuckin problem
Fuckin problem, I'm a problem child
Woop
Baby, can't you see? You only pity me
I didn't ask for your sympathy, or your elated energy

Would it set me free? Would it give me hope?
Would it work for me if my heroes were untold?

Honey, what are you doing here? Babe, must be something clear
You stay inside, are you just a child, are you from here?

Would it set me free? Would it give me hope?
Would it work for me if my heroes were untold?

Would it set me free? Would it work for me, oh?
Would it work for me if my heroes were untold?
Would it set me free? Would it give me, oh?
Would it work for me if the audience were told?

[Verse 1:]
Oh, it's hardly a secret
You ain't gon stop tryna get where you going until you reach it
Always had them bars back in the day
When the same ones running up on you wasn't speaking
Look at all your achievements
You work hard so it'd be kinda hard not to believe that
You party every weekend (weekend)
Fuck em all who act like they ain't see it then
All them nights on the plane
Losses a nigga took, had to charge it to the game
Always wanted stardom and the fame
Learn to out smart em
And now it ain't no stopping the champagne from poppin'
The draws from droppin'
Us seeing muscle cars and coppin' em
Started off just a little less popular

[Chorus:]
Now you got a new place
You drive a new car
You smile for the cameras, live life like a superstar
Don't care what they say
You reach for the stars
Got everything you always dreamed or thought about
And everyone knows who you are

[Verse 2:]
Never gets boring
And haters in your face, you just ignore em
Don't know what they talking shit for
See niggas get theirs, you just tryna get yours
Therefore, you left all the people you care for
Hopped on a plane and got airborne
Seen all the bullshit comin' and fell for it
But it's all good now
Cause the same ones that talk shit telling everyone you made it
Then you start seein' hoes you dated
And thoughts start getting jaded
Now your life's sort of different ain't it
Feel your scars knowin what your pain is
But what's it all worth if it's painless?
Say you wanna be famous

[Chorus:]
Now you got a new place
You drive a new car
You smile for the cameras live life like a superstar
Don't care what they say
You reach for the stars
Got everything you always dreamed or thought about
And everyone knows who you
Are, are, are, are, are, are, are, are
Are, are, are, are, are, are, are
Who you
Are are, are, are, are, are, are, are
Are, are, are, are, are, are, are
Who you are

[Verse 3:]
Always knew I was this good
But never knew I'd be this good
Them niggas just starting, I've been doing it
Hear em talk but they ain't living my life
In the dark tryna get in my light
But chances I don't get em, dodge twice
Spendin' grands for hoes, this is the high life
And for the camera's posing this the high life
Bottles raising for my niggas not here
I pour out a couple sips
Blew em on the beach, I smoke for you on my trips
Them days I was younger I knew this life was the shit
But never like this
It's so amazing, we ain't gotta duck shots
We just pour and chase em
Ain't worry bout it, cause they gon hate
Know where I'm going, look where I came from

[Chorus:]
Now you got a new place
You drive a new car
You smile for the cameras live life like a superstar
Don't care what they say
You reach for the stars
Got everything you always dreamed or thought about
And everyone knows who you

Are, are, are, are, are, are, are, are
Are, are, are, are, are, are, are
Who you
Are are, are, are, are, are, are, are
Are, are, are, are, are, are, are
Who you are
I know what you're used to
We're gonna do something different tonight

Now were gonna do this thing a lil different tonight
You gonna come over and pick me up in your ride
You gonna knock, then you gonna wait
Ooh, you gonna take me on a date
Youre gonna open my door and I'ma reach over and open yours

Gonna pay for dinner, take me to see a movie
And whisper in my ear how bad you really wanna do me
Girl, now take me home and get up in my pants
Pour me up a shot and force me to the bed

I'm always on the top, tonight I'm on the bottom
Cause we trading places
When I can't take no more, tell me you ain't stopping
Cause we trading places

No, put it on me, baby, till I say, ooh, wee
And tell to shut up before the neighbors hear me
This is how it feels when you do it like me
Were trading places
Gon' get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
Gon' get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
Gon' get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
Were trading places

I plan on waking you up to a cup of Folgers
Pancakes and eggs, I owe you breakfast in bed, oh baby
And your orange juice sitting on a coaster
Toast on the side' baby, strawberry and grape jelly

You finished, let me get that drink
Pull the curtain from the window
Time to get up, baby
Let me make this bed up, baby

Today we going shopping blowing 30 on me
Make it 60, screaming like you really love me
Skip dinner and we gonna rent a movie
You order Chinese food right before you do me
You're coming on strong, baby, let me wash my hair
She said hurry up, then get in the bed

You get on top, tonight I'm on the bottom
Cause we trading places
When I can't take no more, tell me you ain't stopping
Cause we trading places
No, put it on me, baby, till I say, ooh, wee
And tell to shut up before the neighbors hear me
This is how it feels when you do it like me
Were trading places

Gon' get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
Gon' get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
Gon' get it, get it, get it, get it, get it
Were trading places

Wash the car, I'm gonna walk the dog
Take out the trash with nothing but your t-shirt on
I'm gonna press your shirt, gonna wrinkle mine's up
In the kitchen going crazy, we don't give a what

Where you want me?
Give it to me, baby, baby, babe
Oh, oh, oh, ooh, ooh, baby, baby, yeah

You get on top, tonight I'm on the bottom
Cause we trading places
When I can't take no more, you say you ain't stopping
Cause we trading places

Now were gonna do this thing a lil different tonight
Trading places
Stay tuned for part 2, you've been me, I, I've been you
But we gonna switch this thing back, I'm a put it on your

I've been down hearted baby
Ever since the day we met
I said I've been down hearted baby
Ever since the day we met
Our love is nothing but the blues, woman
Baby, how blue can you get?

You're evil when I'm with you, baby
And you're jealous when we're apart
I said You're evil when I'm with you, baby
And you're jealous when we're apart
How blue can you get baby
The answer is right here in my heart

I gave you a brand new Ford
But you said: I want a Cadillac
I bought you a ten dollar dinner
And you said: thanks for the snack
I let you live in my pent house
You said it just a shack
I gave seven children
And now you wanna give them back
I said I've been down hearted baby
Ever since the day we met
Our love is nothing but the blues
Baby, how blue can you get?
Bob Marley: Whoa, now!

Screwface know-a who fi frighten!

Screwface know-a who fi frighten!
Like I told, they say, "Coward, man"
Gonna keep some bones
And all violent man gonna weep and moan
He that exalted him say, "Yeah!"
Shall be obeyed

Remember Jah - Jah children deh!
Don't dread no pain
Fear do we go now
To the rivers of ungodly waters, we'll fear no foe
(fear no foe, fear no foe)
Wherever I go
Not even the pestilence
That crawl at I'n'I
Can't do - wo-wo-wo - me no wrong (just can't do me no wrong)
Oh, now!

Remember those walls I built

Well baby they're tumbling down

And they didn't even put up a fight

They didn't even make a sound

I found a way to let you in

But I never really had a doubt

Standing in the light of your halo

I've got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened

Every rule I had you breakin'

It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm looking now

I'm surrounded by your embrace

Baby I can see your halo

You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more

It's written all over your face

Baby I can feel your halo

Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo, halo, halo

I can see your halo, halo, halo

I can feel your halo, halo, halo

I can see your halo, halo, halo
Woah...

Hit me like a ray of sun

Burning through my darkest night

You're the only one that I want

Think I'm addicted to your light

I swore I'd never fall again

But this don't even feel like fallin'

Gravity can't forget

To pull me back to the ground again

It's like I've been awakened

Every rule I had you breakin'

The risk that I'm takin'

I'm never gonna shut you out
Everywhere I'm looking now

I'm surrounded by your embrace

Baby I can see you halo

You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more

It's written all over your face

Baby I can feel your halo

Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo, halo, halo

I can see your halo, halo, halo

I can feel your halo, halo, halo

I can feel your halo, halo, halo

I can see your halo, halo, halo

I can feel your halo, halo, halo

Halooooo ouuuu

Halooooo ouuuu

Halooooo ouuuu

Ouuuuu ouuuuu ouuuuu

Everywhere I'm looking now

I'm surrounded by your embrace

Baby I can see you halo

You know you're my saving grace

You're everything I need and more

It's written all over you face

Baby I can feel your halo

Pray it won't fade away

I can feel your halo, halo, halo

I can see your halo, halo, halo

I can feel your halo, halo, halo

I can see your halo, halo, halo

I can feel your halo, halo, halo

I can see your halo, halo, halo

Kels, T.I., T-Pain

Ladies, if your man ain't hitting it right

Just call this number on the screen

I'll be at your rescue, yeah

[Verse 1]
I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Verse 2]
I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

[Verse 3]
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Verse 4]
I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you

[Verse 5]
I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
Look at you all
Still my guitar gently weeps

Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, ooh

[Ludacris - Verse 1:]
Welcome to my little sanctuary
You've been looking so good all day
And you really got a nigga pretty anxious baby
Better call your boss tell him that your daddy's home
Take a couple days off
And take it off and leave nothing but your T-shirts and your panties on
Feeling high but I'm hung real low looking sorta like a tripod
So power down your cell phone and power up your iPod
Power down your inhibitions and power up your inner freak
(yes... fuck)
It's the only words that you finna speak
Its about to get real x-rated
Can you handle what I'm 'bout to do
But enough about me let me think
Should I be worrying about if I can handle you
Damn right I'ma get that thing and I'ma put my name on it
All night I'ma whip that thing, all state better put a claim on it
I claim my territory, my tongue finna mark you up
You could be my fire cracker, my tongue gon spark you up
Get ready for blast off, waterfalls gon splash off
You might lose around 4 or 5 pounds so get ready to sweat your ass off

[Trey Songz - Chorus:]
Welcome to my sex room
Where your body meets my body
Its our private afterparty
If you want it girl I got it in my sex room
Candles and a pole sets your body to your soul
From the bed down to the floor, sex room
Mirrors in the head board, even got a camcord
Baby won't you dance in my sex room
Welcome to my sex room
Where your body meets my body
Its a private afterparty
If you want it girl I got it
In my sex room

[Ludacris - Verse 2]
Let the candles burn, Imma turn these lights down
And when your body gets hot, it'll get you licked up and iced down
Nipples hard as rocks, lips as soft as cotton
Your the apple of my eye, and I got you spoiled rotten
I'mma get my video camera, lets make a movie baby
You the star so as soon as I press record you got's to do me baby
You can stare all in the mirror, take a pic at how good you looking
Imma have your body smoking, take a look at what Luda's cooking
My arm underneath your leg leg
Or behind your head is how I gots to get ya
Right hand left hand all red in the bed like we've been playing twister
Now I've got you tangled up and you caught all in my web
Should I let you loose nah
I think I'll get the blindfold instead
You better get a couple towels baby
Cos we about to slip and slide
You don't ever need a horse or saddle
I'mma give you this dick to ride
I'mma grant your every wish and fulfill your fantasy
Ain't nobody else allowed in the sex room
It's only you and me

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
First you say you needed me
Then you give me sympathy
They say good girls never win
Something good in giving in

{Barry Gibb}
How do I get through to you?
You must be made of stone

[Verse 2]
Just when I was safe and sound
Love, you built a wall around
You take a hard line attitude
Time to send me back to school

Or take me, take me to your

[Chorus]
House of shame
Easy on your body when you got no name
Hold me like you know me, I'm a falling star
Catch me if you can, show me the way inside

[Verse 3]
You can knock on any door
I know what I'm looking for
It's a red light, hit and run
Time to turn the engines on

{Barry Gibb}
Pretty girl lives all alone
I must be going home

[Verse 4]
Hot as hell and cold as ice
Everything I sacrifice
I got to pick up on what you do
I just can't get over you

You take me, take me to your

[Chorus]
House of shame
Easy on your body when you got no name
Hold me like you know me, I'm a falling star
Catch me if you can, show me the way inside

[Verse 5]
Tell me what you really want from life
Loving you, darling, you got me infatuated
Good love is not for sale, I nearly gave myself away

[Pre-Chorus]
Pretty girl lives all alone
Take me to your, take me to your

[Outro] (x4)
House of shame
Easy on your body when you got no name
Hold me like you know me, I'm a falling star
Catch me if you can, show me the way inside

[Verse 1]
Don't get too close to me, don't overreact
You're not the enemy as a matter of fact
You got your pretty face and you got any name you wore
Gonna stick by you, gonna stumble over what to do

[Hook]
I want it, good loving, wanna be your plaything
I want it, good loving, bring out the beast in me
I want it, good loving, wanna make your heart sing
In the shadows we are free and I walk you through it

[Chorus]
It's my neighborhood, that's where I belong
You're in trouble if you disagree with me
It's my neighborhood, that's where I belong
You find out why

It's my neighborhood, that's where I belong
You're in trouble if you disagree with me
It's my neighborhood, that's where I belong
You find out why

[Verse 2]
So many tell you that you can't win
It's a battle if you're lonely or if you're starting over
Two-fisted and fast on your feet
And you know there's something more
And the city kicks it out of you and

[Hook]
I want it, good loving, wanna be your plaything
I want it, good loving, bring out the worst in me
I want it, good loving, wanna make your heart sing
In the shadows we are free and I walk you through it

[Chorus] (x2)
It's my neighborhood, that's where I belong
You're in trouble if you disagree with me
It's my neighborhood, that's where I belong
You find out why

[Post-Chorus]
It's my neighborhood, that's where I belong
You're in trouble if
(Trouble)
You disagree with me
It's my neighborhood, that's where I belong
You find out why

[Instrumental]

[Chorus - Var. 1]
It's my neighborhood, that's where I belong
You're in trouble if you disagree with me
It's my neighborhood, that's where I belong
You find out why

[Verse 1: Robin Gibb]
I've seen the story, I've read it over once or twice
I said that you say a little bit of bad advice
I've been in trouble happened to me all my life
I lie and you lie and who would get the sharpest knife

[Verse 2: Barry Gibb]
You shouldn't be somebody like that
Not the kind of man to throw his hat into the ring and
Go down without following through the day turns into night
Go down without following through the day turns into night

[Chorus]
Ohh, ohh, ohh
This is just where I came in

[Hook: Robin Gibb]
Hope rides on, but I'll go anywhere
Yes, I'll go anywhere with you
Time has gone, but I'll go anywhere
Yes, I'll go anywhere with you

[Verse 3: Barry & Robin Gibb]
This is the danger zone this is where I came in
They know not what they do forgive them of their sins
They know they cannot take away what you have given me

[Chorus]
Ohh, ohh, ohh
This is just where I came in

[Verse 4: Robin Gibb]
Fade into color, color into black and white
Under the bedclothes everything will be alright
I know that you know nothing ever stays the same
Said so, I said so love will never speak it's name

[Verse 5: Barry Gibb]
Never gonna find somebody like you
Beauty with a brain and a body too
I could never make a move on a woman that leads me on
She's got a little bit of something for everyone
It's a little too late and the wolf is on the run

[Hook]
Hope rides on, but I'll go anywhere
Yes, I'll go anywhere with you
Time has gone, but I'll go anywhere
Yes, I'll go anywhere with you

[Verse 6: Barry & Robin]
I always told myself I would regret this day
That I would fall apart and watch you walk away
That you would cry out loud and I would stand aside

[Chorus]
Ohh, ohh, ohh
This is just where I came in
Ohh, ohh, ohh
This is just where I came in

[Hook - Var. 1]
I can fly, but I'll go anywhere
Yes, I'll go anywhere with you
Time goes by, but I'll go anywhere
Yes, I'll go anywhere with you

[Verse 3]
This is the danger zone this is where I came in
They know not what they do forgive them of their sins
They know they cannot take away what you have given me

[Outro]
Ohh, ohh, ohh
This is just where I came in
This is just where I came in
Ohh, ohh, ohh
This is just where I came in
This is just where I came in
You bring good to my lonely life, honestly?
It's hard for me to look into your eyes, when..I say
That I would be nothing without your love
I feel the rush and it's aaamaaaa zzzzingggg

Maybe I've been always destined to end up in this place, yeah
I don't mean to come off selfish but I want it all
Love will always be a lesson get out of it's way, cause I know, all I know, all I know

I'm a prisoner to my addiction
I'm addicted to a life, that's so empty and so cold
I'm a prisoner to my decision
Owwwwwww, Owwwwwwww, OwwwWWWWWWwwwwww

I'm a prisoner to my addiction
I'm addicted to a life, that's so empty and so cold
I'm a prisoner to my decision
Owwwwwww, Owwwwwwww, OwwwWWWWWWwwwwww

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Fifty thousand on my ring, you know I'm soo clean
Pourin' up the Hi-Tech, I got all this lean
Make a hunnid thousand in my robin jeans
Ridin' through the city feelin' like a king

Hop up in the shower and we fuckin' all night

"Soulja, how you do that boy?, You soo fly"

She got the cake, hop out the Rari then hop out the Wraith
I'm out of space, I beat the case
Thirty one thousand in one minute, oh my god, I'm out of state
In a statues where I'm pushin' the door
Ridin' 'round, puttin' the game in a figure four
I'm in like Figaro the money comin' in and the money, it gotta go
Money is up in the trash bag
Flyin' on the carpet like I'm Aladdin
Money comin' in, you know I'm cashin'
Walk inside the bank, I need a million
Right now and I'm not playin'
Call my killas, they come through, you know they sprayin'
I got gold on my hair like super sayian
Money comin' in, do you dig what I'm sayin'?
And my backyard is a vacation
I'mma get that cake, there ain't no playin'
A million in your face, boy, why you hatin'?
I just have to have some patience, but I don't got no patience
I will never be the baby, I hop out the Rari, I'm spacin'
You look at the Lambo like oh my god, you're soo amazing
I'm whippin' the cougars, I'm killin' off Cubans
The money come in on my Rubens
I trap out the house, all the money from school

[Hook]
A hunnid thousand in my pocket, I feel soo right
Walk inside my closet, I get soo fly
When I'm on a jet, you know I'm soo high
Bad girl right beside me and she soo fly
A hunnid thousand in my pocket, I feel soo right
Walk inside my closet, I get soo fly
When I'm on a jet, you know I'm soo high
Bad girl right beside me and she soo fly

[Verse 1]
Don't let the day keep movin' on with tears and pride
They hide the sun
Look to the road that lies ahead
I'm turnin' to the dream we left to die
Dyin' alone, cry for the moment you passed me by
Baby I don't now how , I'm only cryin' now

[Chorus]
Search, find
No stone unturned, no hell, no fury gonna stop my love and all it's glory
Search, find
No man, no God, no pain can sever my love for you
God, we're forever
Don't lose the will to make it right

[Verse 2]
A day is just a brighter night
And from the flames, a dyin' love can learn to fly
And rise above in me
All that we are, you are the heart of my everything
Maybe I lose my mind, I'm not the losin' kind

[Chorus]
Search, find
No stone unturned, no hell, no fury gonna stop my love and all it's glory
Search, find
No man, no God, no pain can sever my love for you
God, we're forever
Search, find
No stone unturned, no hell, no fury gonna stop my love and all it's glory
Search, find
No man, no God, no pain can sever my love for you
God, we're forever
Search, find
No stone unturned, no hell, no fury gonna stop my love and all it's glory
Search, find
No man, no God, no pain can sever my love for you
God, we're forever

No stone unturned, no hell, no fury gonna stop my love and all it's glory
Search, find
No man, no God, no pain can sever my love for you

No stone unturned, no hell, no fury gonna stop my love and all it's glory

No man, no God, no pain can sever my love for you

[Verse:]
I'm sorry for the wait nigga
I'm tighter than these pussy hoes, I'm chaff, nigga
Pockets full of crumbs, I'm a bread winner
I'm sorry for the wait nigga
I'm aiming at your Beats by Dr. Dre, nigga
I put up some ornaments today, nigga
Cause round here, every day a holiday, nigga
This that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
That AK shoot like K do
Had to tell myself, 'Tune just stay tuned'
Swear I got the hardest stroke, my shit break brooms
I been high since 1998, nigga
That's 98 degrees, Nick Lachey, nigga
Hope you know the Feds got Instagram
They liking every photo that you take nigga
I was toting a gun before a switchblade
Cut your head off and put it on display
Boy we find out where you live and then we invade
Boy we do not kill no kids but your bitch dead
Oooh, shawty like the way that you floss out
Till I shoot you in the head, now she grossed out
I'm the boss, you just heard it from the horse mouth
I told a nigga count on me and niggas lost count
This world is only preparation for the next
Money bags under my eyes, money over rest
Tryna get 100 M's out the alphabets
Open up my mouth to smile, oooh treasure chest
Oooh, DJ Stevie J keep the Glock on her
I just bought a new .44 and I'mma proud owner
Belfast and Monroe that was our corner
Fuckin' fast in your ho, oooh Kowa-bunga
Sip some lean, pop a Xan bar
My bougie bitch pussy taste like caviar
Once I fuck a bitch, her pussy is a landmark
I don't know how you like your steak but I'm in rare form
Fuck them bitchass niggas, fuck whoever care for 'em
Momma jumped out a plane, I was airborne
Gold watches, gold chains, watch for Leprechauns
Favorite subject was PE, Pablo Escobar
Kill him when he least expect it at a restaurant
Throw him with the rest of 'em in a reservoir
I'm the renaissance man, peep my repertoire
Excuse my French, but it's menage a trois, au revoir
Oooh, my nina Ross got a bad mouth
Yea, I'm consuming grass like a cash cow
Give a fuck 'bout a police with his badge out
If you ain't got a warrant get up out my damn house
This that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
This an all white affair, I brought the yay through
She said Tunechi skate through, and I'mma skate you
I'm aimin' at your grapefruit, blaow, grape juice
Oooh, tell them bitches free dick and blow
Give me head, can't kiss no more
I got free jewelry, car keys, and more
And I just started robbin' like a week ago
Hundred diamonds on my bitch, I don't bling no more
200,000 for a show, you gotta speak to Po
Yeah, got me on my Young Money shit
No Cash Money, just Young Money shit
Woah, got me on my Young Money shit

[Outro:]
My nigga Chaz Ortiz in this bitch with me
Young Mula!

[Intro]
I'm gone...

We don't need your love, no more
Said I'm gone, yeah I'm gone
You don't need to talk, no more
Cause these kids already know
Now these kids already know
Said I'm gone, I'm gone
We don't need your love
I was broken, I was broken, I was so broke
I used to walk around the town when I was homeless
Me and Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans
And flip it just to get these hoes up out those outfits
Now we get faded while we walking with a joystick
They don't wanna -

[Verse 2]
Used to roam on queen now I sing queen street anthems
Used to hate attention now I pull up in that wagon

[Pre-Chorus]
You seem a little different, from the last time I saw you
I hear it in the way you talk too
Don't know why you're trying to be somebody new
You seem a little different, from the last time I saw you
I hear it in the way you talk too
Don't know why you're trying to be somebody new

[Chorus]
I'm faded off a whole pill (A whole pill, a whole pill)
Suburban swerve on ghost wheels (On ghost wheels)
Bitch biting on my ear like I'm Holyfield (I'm Holyfield)
Got the gas and the splash like an oil spill
We don't give no fucks 'bout how you feel
We don't give no fucks man we riding still (Oh no, no, no)
Ain't got no fucks to give that's on moms for real
Ain't got no fucks to give that's on moms for real
For real, for real

[Verse 1]
I say send that guap over, they say that I won't go nowhere (Ooh)
I said what part of 'I am the shit' do you not understand (Ooh)
Ooh, she said she unemployed but that mouth can work
You'll drown in the wave if you cannot surf
If you don't know how to surf

[Pre-Chorus]
You seem a little different, from the last time I saw you
I hear it in the way you talk too
Don't know why you're trying to be somebody new

[Chorus]
I'm faded off a whole pill (A whole pill, a whole pill)
Suburban swerve on ghost wheels (On ghost wheels)
Bitch biting on my ear like I'm Holyfield (I'm Holyfield)
Got the gas and the splash like an oil spill
We don't give no fucks 'bout how you feel
We don't give no fucks man we riding still (Oh no, no, no)
Ain't got no fucks to give that's on moms for real
Ain't got no fucks to give that's on moms for real
For real, for real

[Verse 2]
I, I know this is a lot to take in right now
But all that I did was to make all my family royal (Ooh)
And I still got to stunt
I still got to flex
For the muhfuckers that said I wasn't going to be shit
Man I got to
I got to show that they're wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
You seem a little different, from the last time I saw you
I hear it in the way you talk too
Don't know why you're trying to be somebody new

Everybody know that Soulja keep a lot of cash
Bad bitch on me, almost crashed
I got so much money, so much swag
Ten chains and some tattoos
Get your baby mama and I fuck her in the bathroom
A young nigga on the 

[?]
Soulja Montanas 2014 my own rules
I pull up with my top down
And all the fuck niggas mad because I hot now
Disrespect Soulja and I shoot the whole block down
I'm on the block with a whole damn fucking pound
A hundred rounds in the back of the backseat
Niggas get to shooting, start running like a track meet
I'm getting money and you ain't even got to ask me
I'm gettin money like that nigga from degrassi

[Hook]
Pull up with my top down
Niggas get mad because I'm hot now
She ain't used to want me now she bop now
I make this bitch pop now

[2x]

[Verse 2]
(transcribe)

[Hook]
Pull up with my top down
Niggas get mad because I'm hot now
She ain't used to want me now she bop now
I make this bitch pop now

[2x]

Pull up with my top down
Niggas get mad because I'm hot now

[x2]

[Intro]
Stop, stop, stop…
Fuck niggas gon' be fuck niggas
That’s why we never give a fuck when a fuck nigga switched up
I’m so sorry
Did you hope I was crying?
It was rough without you
It was rough without you

[Verse 1]
I did some charity today for the kids
But I'm used to it 'cause all y'all charity cases
All y’all stare in my face in hopes you could be the replacement
Niggas is snitchin' on us without no interrogation
I stay silent 'cause we at war and I’m very patient
Six God is watchin', I just hope you’re prepared to face him
I’m charged up, I’m charged up

[Verse 2]
Wow, I’m honored that you think this is staged
I’m flattered, man, in fact, I’m amazed
The perfect start to the summer, man, this shit is a doozy
This shit a twist in the movie, but don't jump to conclusions
You boys are gettin' into your feelings on me
You should embrace it, this could be one of our realest moments
Okay, the flow start to feel familiar, don’t it?
Must I remind you that Jimmy got 20 million on it?
Need DJ Clue to drop a bomb on it
None of them want this shit more than I want it
I seen it all comin', knew they would push a button
East egg huntin', they gotta look for somethin'
Done doin' favors for people
'Cause it ain’t like I need the money I make off a feature
I see you niggas havin' trouble goin' gold
Turnin' into some so-and-sos that no one knows
But so it go
Come live all your dreams out at OVO
We gon' make sure you get your bread and you know the ropes
I get a ring and I bring it home like I’m Cory Joe
No woman ever had me star-struck
Or was able to tell me to get my bars up
I’m charged up
Oh no, we eatin', niggas ain’t about to starve us
Nah, niggas ain't about to starve us
I'm charged up

[Verse 3]
I bought my niggas rollies off of Thank Me Later
While these boys was stanky leggin'
Trust me, this information is vital
I’m tryin' to take the high road, I still got love for my idols
I got me a deal with Apple and I still feel entitled
Rumor has it, there’s somethin' that only I know
Rumor has it, I steer the ship with my eyes closed
Rumor has it, I either fucked her or never could
But rumor has it, hasn’t done you niggas any good
It’s sound, sound, sound ‘til the day I die
We goin' live to keep this shit alive
Cops are killin' people with they arms up
And your main focus is tryna harm us?
And you think you ‘bout to starve us?
Niggas ain’t about to starve us
Nah, I’m charged up!

[Outro]
(Stop, stop, stop, stop…)
Have you seen me? I’m doing so good
Every time we meet: "Oh, I’m so sorry"
(Fuck niggas gon' be fuck niggas
That’s why we never give a fuck when a fuck nigga switched up)

[Sample]
"You know, I kept it real
It ain’t too many real people out here
And people be on some weak bitch-ass shit all day long
Industry people… regular people…
And then when you keep it real with people, they cross the line, take your kindness for weakness and that’s weak."

[Intro]
You used to call me on my
You used to, you used to
Yeah

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 1]
Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 2]
Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Bridge]
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

[Chorus]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late-night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Outro]
Ever since I left the city…

[Chorus]
You my right hand, you my go to
Told me everything about you, that's a bold move
I know that you're out here
And there's things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do
Yeah, and they never will

[Verse 1]
But I swear you gotta chill
You wanna grip a Benz wheel
And I know you can't wait
You dream big and sleep late
You got a lot on your plate
That's why you're always working out
Taking pictures of yourself
You don't see anybody else
And you're like, "Oh well"
You're like, "Fuck it, oh well"
My past behind me like a ponytail

[Chorus]
But you my right hand, you my go to
Told me everything about you, that's a bold move
I know that you're out here
And there's things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do
Yeah, and they never will

[Verse 2]
Okay, I know you want the Audi
I know you want to go to Maui
You and all your girlfriends
The ones you never bring around me
'Cause you don't trust me like your last man
Did he open doors for ya?
Buy the things you can't afford for ya?
'Cause he must have did a lot for ya
I just fell back with it
And now your past is behind you like the car with the strap in it
Thank God that's finished
'Cause now it's back to business
Any more Henny and you're past the limit
You told me 'bout the picture, now you have to send it
I would never put you on blast when I get it

[Chorus]
You my right hand, you my go to
Told me everything about you, that's a bold move
I know that you're out here
And there's things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do
And they never will
You my right hand, you my go to
Told me everything about you, that's a bold move
I know that you're out here
And there's things you gotta go through
Just know that these streets just don't love you like I do
And they never will

[Verse 1: Jake]
I heard it told by her mother old
She could try, she could try it
With the power of tin and a bottle of gin
She was wise, she was wise to it
Cocked her father's gun, like the oldest son
She could try, she could try it
Blessed by the bed where she laid her head and calmed to a dull roar

[Chorus: Jake]
Oh oh, oh oh woah, oh oh woah
It was a suicide Saturday
Oh oh, oh oh woah, oh oh woah
In a summertime kind of way
Oh oh, oh oh woah, oh oh woah
It was a suicide Saturday
Oh oh, oh oh woah, oh oh woah
In a summertime kind of way

[Verse 2: Jake]
She felled the streets 'til she heard the screams
She could drive, she could drive it
That was where she'd buy her time, yeah
Her friends were crazed in the solemn rains
She could try, she could try it
I met her once, she was tight, she was tight
She was tight, she was tight, she was tight as hell

[Chorus: Jake]
Oh oh, oh oh woah, oh oh woah
It was a suicide Saturday
Oh oh, oh oh woah, oh oh woah
In a summertime kind of way
Oh oh, oh oh woah, oh oh woah
It was a suicide Saturday
Oh oh, oh oh woah, oh oh woah
In a summertime kind of way

[Bridge: Jake]
Oh don't you wait now
Oh don't you wait now
Oh don't you wait now for me
Oh don't you wait now
Oh don't you wait now
Oh don't you wait now for me, for me, for me, yeah
Oh don't you wait now
Oh don't you wait now
Oh don't you wait now for me, for me, for me, yeah
Oh don't you wait now
Oh don't you wait now
Oh don't you wait now for me, for me, for me, yeah
Oh don't you wait now
Oh don't you wait now
Oh don't you wait now for me

[Outro: Jake]
Suicide Saturday
Suicide Saturday

[Verse 1: Jake]
Three leagues down the soft side of where you left my
Gold rose crown, you broke down, and left me with a
Chest hum, a black gun, and forty dollars
Chest hum, a black gun, and forty dollars

[Verse 2: Jake]
Three weeks down, I drowned myself in whiskey
Came back round, and drowned out, and left me with a
Chest hum, a black gun, and forty dollars
Chest hum, a black gun, and forty dollars

[Chorus: Jake, with Nathan]
Streetlights talk the same way my mother told me
I walk the same way my father told me
Back straight, chest out, just like a soldier
Back straight, chest out, just like a soldier
Wise men talk the same way my mother told me
I walk the same way my father told me
Back straight, chest out, just like a soldier
Back straight, chest out, just like a soldier

[Bridge: Nathan,  with Whistler]
You go down south, south
You go down south, south
You go down south, south
You go down south, south
You go down south, south
You go down south, south
You go down south, south
You go down south, south
You go down south, south
You go down south, south
You go down south, south
You go down south, south

[Chorus/Outro: Jake, Nathan, with Whistler & (Whistler)]
Streetlights talk the same way my mother told me
(You go down south, south)
I walk the same way my father told me
(You go down south, south)
Back straight, chest out, just like a soldier
(You go down south, south)
Back straight, chest out, just like a soldier
(You go down south, south)
Wise men talk the same way my mother told me
(You go down south, south)
I walk the same way my father told me
(You go down south, south)
Back straight, chest out, just like a soldier
(You go down south, south)
Back straight, chest out, just like a soldier
(You go down south, south)

[Verse 1: Jake]
Back to the streets where the kids are new
Love was around the corner from you
You played it well, like an old-time jive
Girl, I swear, I've never seen you look so alive

[Verse 2: Jake]
Back the train up on the path
Rolling off the tracks, no you'll never see it again
Wrote a song that you dug so much
Living it up with the boys and such

[Chorus: All]
Oh, oh,  we won't go
Back to the room where we sold our souls
Oh, oh, we won't go
Oh, oh, boots and bros
Down with the shrine of American gold
Oh, oh, boots and bros

[Bridge: Jake, All]
We moved in packs together, bounded by our oldest brothers
Oh, oh, oh
(oh, oh, oh, oh)
The night was ours for taking, rolling cigarettes and sneaking
O-o-out
(oh, oh, oh)
We sung our songs of youth and promised that we'd never lose it
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus: All]
Oh, we won't go
Back to the room where we sold our souls
Oh, we won't go
Oh, boots and bros
Down with the shrine of American gold
Oh, boots and bros

[Verse 1: Sam Smith]
I'm feeling something, something different
When you left, my picture changed
I was blinded, I'd not envisioned
The same face in a different frame

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Smith]
It's an omen, caught my baby crying
Saw the silver lining
It must be an omen
Needed you to show me, without you I am lonely

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
My mind would rule my heart
I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
It left me torn apart
But now I see your tears as an omen

[Post-Chorus: Sam Smith]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, omen

[Verse 2: Sam Smith]
You were waiting, I was vacant
You left before  my eyes
Then it hit me, you're relocating
And I need you by my side

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Smith]
It's an omen, caught my baby crying
Saw the silver lining
It must be an omen
Needed you to show me, without you I am lonely

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
My mind would rule my heart
I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
It left me torn apart
But now I see your tears as an omen
My mind would rule my heart
I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
It left me torn apart
But now I see your tears as an omen

[Outro: Sam Smith]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, omen (Woah, now, love)
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I take time to make that (Money)
Some breakdowns get caked back (Money)
Flip eight times, get eight stacks (Money)
You can not get jack for free
And my, proceeds and cash right (Money)
There's no need to stash right (Money)
Same four G's from last night (Money)
You cannot take that from me

[Verse 1]
Hey yo I'm movin' on up, excuse a moi, pardon it's me
There's a new chapter to life that I'm starting to see
And I'ma make and spend money to the hardest degree
And on the low I probably mimic every artist I see
I need a house, a wifey, a nice watch and a lot of cake
I can't lie, there's certain figures I gotta make
And for my family, this a shot that I gotta take
Cause where I live there's nobody as hot as Drake
Which basically means, who's faith in his team
Will resort to new cars, briefcases with cream
Tryna find a space in the jeans for placing the green
And a watch get they attention, the bracelet's clean
I'm stayin' the music, wifey kinda need to be a band lover
I keep it flow, an old school like your grandmother
I'm a tan brother, they use rubber bands to keep his money intact, if you don't like it you should ban rubber

[Hook]
I take time to make that (Money)

[Verse 2]
These days I really can't break 20s, hunnid and make money, money
Every month, the government will take money from me
Make 750, look how quicky I spent that, don't call me broke cause I strictly  resent that
Last my P had to flip my the rent, because the tax bracket I'm in's is 50 percent flat
All because of Ebay givin' me leway, basically do the PayPal, I need a raise now
Seems every time a nigga stop and he eat, I end up always tryna shop and compete
They know a nigga 'bout it when it's in his size and cops it in more colors than Popsicle Pete
Till I'm piled to the top with receipts, trust the store and I don't understand less is more
Wanna get 'em to the point where they owe me, and they gon' see Drake's on his JOB, it's like...

[Hook]
I take time to make that (Money)

Baby you understand me now
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Doncha know no one alive can always be an angel?
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad

[Chorus]
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

[Verse 2]
You know sometimes baby I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And then sometimes it seems again that all I have is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side

[Chorus]
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

[Verse 3]
If I seem edgy I want you to know
I never mean to take it out on you
Life has its problems and God knows I have more than my share
But that's one thing I never mean to do

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

[Bridge]
Oh, don't let me be

I hop out the Lambo, the Panamera and I'm game like Atari
I'm with the old school like safari

Niggas with me man they know that I'm gnarly
Screaming white boy when I'm poppin' the molly
She want the lean, yes she want the molly
She pop a molly, she hop out the Mase'
Hop out the Mase', the tats on my body

And free all my niggas that locked up, you know that they in the slammer
I'm breaking you, can not touch this on like I'm MC Hammer

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
I just got a house, I got another million

A 100 million jug, nigga I'm getting it

For my love is like the wind
And wild is the wind
Give me more than one caress
Satisfy this hungriness
Let the wind blow through your heart
For wild is the wind
You touch me
I hear the sound of mandolins
And you kiss me
And with your kiss my life begins
You're spring to me
All things to me
Don't you know you're life itself
Like a leaf clings to a tree
Oh my darling, cling to me
For we're creatures of the wind
And wild is the wind

[Verse 1]
Fire flow, let me fascinate
Put python seats, Jake the snake
I rock Bape, that bathin' grape
You fake the Bape, that's pump fake
I ball on turf, that's Chevy Chase
That's Caddyshack, don't be actin' shady
Lash out on the owner, nigga
Don't be harassin' my shorty, nigga
Borin' niggas, don't be borin', niggas
I'm the swag god in the holy temples
Spend 65k on my dental
Got the ripped denim, black card in 'em
3 car garage, black cars in 'em
Need more space to put the Rolls in it
Rollin' blunts for the fuck of it
I'm already high, I'm just talkin' shit
Shit on niggas like an eagle do
Give that bitch a break like an interlude
Bought a parachute, eatin' barracuda
I'm a barbarian rude nigga
With a ghetto gang and some pretty bitches
Walk on Jimmy Kimmel with some real killers
Real niggas, Tommy Hilfiger
This tommy gun my real hitta

[Hook]
Young nigga chillin' in the master suite
Ask me where I used to sleep
In the car parked on the street
Ask me what I used to eat
McDonald's like twice a week
Now I get served in my master suite
Just watched my bitch masturbate
Shit's milk, and it's sweet, nigga

[Verse 2]
Niggas sweet, I'm the candyman
Here I go again, can't get rid of me
I'm on Sunset, now I'm overseas
Lost the Lambo key, I just ordered 3
Mickey Ds, played the 62
Red and yellow like Ronald do
I'm hard to break like a Rondo 2
Don't weigh a lot but I'll take your food
Face to face, she give me face
'Til her face's blue like hunnits, new
Spend 10K at Mr. Chows
My mama proud, these niggas bow
That's Tyga's style, you stole my style
You a hidden dragon, crouchin' tiger style
Jungle shit, my niggas wild
You a bitch, thinkin' out loud
I'm gamblin', my diamonds loud
My Rollie face original
Look on your face like, nigga how
I came from nothin', had dreams of stuntin'
Never owned a Porsche, so yeah I want it
Just to say I had it, now you can have it
Fuck y'all, I'm just livin' lavish
Rather die that nigga than to live average

[Hook]
Young nigga chillin' in the master suite
Ask me where I used to sleep
In the car parked on the street
Ask me what I used to eat
McDonalds like twice a week
Now I get served in my master suite
Just watched my bitch masturbate
Shit's milk, and it's sweet, nigga
Young nigga chillin' in the master suite
Ask me where I used to sleep
In the car parked on the street
Ask me what I used to eat
McDonalds like twice a week
Now I get served in my master suite
Just watched my bitch masturbate
Shit's milk, and it's sweet, nigga

[Outro]
Real niggas in my family tree
Rich niggas in my family tree, nigga
Bad bitches in my fantasies
That pussy good, and it's clean, nigga
Shit's milk, and it's sweet
Me and my bitch beauty and the beast
She a masterpiece
Young nigga chillin' in my master suite

[Intro]
Oh man
Oh man, oh man
Not again

[Verse 1]
Yeah
I learned the game from William Wesley, you can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back, like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Woah—very important and very pretentious
When I look back, I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options
I wanna see my niggas go insane
You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith, playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean whoa, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad 'cause I got the Midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas
And shout to all my boss bitches wifin' niggas
Make sure you hit him with the prenup
Then tell that man to ease up
I did another one, I did another one
You still ain't did shit about the other one

[Chorus]
I got the drink in me, going back to back
Yeah, going back to back
I got the drink in me, going back to back
Yeah, I'm going back to back

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna hear about this ever again
Not even when she tell him that they better as friends
Not even when you saying, "Drizzy, tell 'em again!"
I been puttin' on a show, it was a sell-out event
Oh, you need better seatin'
I didn't wanna do it, gave me every reason
The point I'm tryin' to make is I don't ever need 'em
Seen what you'd do for fame, what would you do for freedom?
Please, check 'em for a wire or a earpiece
Please, please do not let these niggas near me
Please, think before you come for the great one
Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one?
Please, somebody stop me
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'

[Chorus]
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
Yeah, they want it back to back
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back
I took a break from Views, now it's back to that, nigga (Six)

[Hook: Verse Simmonds]
I need a ghetto girl, with a big ol' ghetto booty
Every time I come around she try to give it to me
Every time she turn around it's like a fucking movie
Every time she take it down, I wanna fuck her
She throwin' that ass every where, for this money
She throwin' that for this drink, she throwin' that all this cream
She throwin' that ass everywhere, get it on the floor
She throwin' that, work it like a pro, she throwin' that ain't nothing wrong

[Verse: Gucci Mane]
I'm smokin' on that super gas, you might not even wanna smoke with me
Sellin' dope, my niggas rob you, don't even wanna buy dope from me
Not Lil' Flip but I'm sucker free, not Lil' Tip but they crown me king
Infrared beam , on my MAC-10, scrap on me now think I'm just rapping
30 Glock shawty, I make a nigga run, like a nigga just signed for a USA team
Kick him in the ass, now he got hemorrhoid, that's what you got for trynna fuck with my boys
Thou shall not kill and I know it's God's will, but that's something I gotta take up with the Lord
Song is a sword and I know it's a sword, but this 40 right here'll shoot up your Accord
Make the crowd applaud, when I pull up in the void, pull up in the Charger, nigga, no charge
100,000 dollars got 'em taken it apart, niggas said they never seen a Dodge so hard
8 bottle, molly, I'm hard from the start, 24/7 Imma keep me a wad
Credit card fraud ass broad but the bitch go hard and act like one of the boys

[Hook: Verse Simmonds]
I need a ghetto girl, with a big ol' ghetto booty

You got the work, baby, I got the oohs
Hop out the shower, then hop on the penis
Tell 'em niggas to chill when I pull up on you
Sing r&b, but I'm ready to shoot

[Hook: Verse Simmonds]
I need a ghetto girl, with a big ol' ghetto booty

[Verse 2: 21 Savage]

First pussy nigga tried me man I had to bless him

[Verse]
Welcome to the wild side, Hub city's wild side
Where tecs fly that's homicide, my stacks like a mile high
Fly as a bitch, got a condo on cloud 9
Slap box with God, jump off heaven and skydive
So supernatural K.dot come and see me on Sci-Fi
From 5-6 with five nines two mac-10s and Glock nines
Lets do this however whenever tell em I'm ready
Waters run deep way before Katrina broke the levee
Look partner, I'm no gangster, I'm no killer
But please believe I know plenty gangsters that'll kill ya
I don't like you, I don't feel ya you're very unfamiliar
So please build your catalog before I knock your cattle off
This saddle off on a red horse that's a red Porsche
That's not your favorite rapper in the booth
That's a dead corpse once K.dot kick chaos
Niggas bitch off like canines click up and click, click, click boom
Smell the fumes on my Levis
Bitches poppin' pills and mushrooms in my hotel rooms
I squeeze dick through their thick thighs then bounce like this beat from T.Dot
Six T.Vs in my new SUV F-U-C-K-Y-O-U pay me
Or pay me no attention and meet the criminal henchmen
Genesis ain't shit, I know local henchmen
Come shoot me I'm in a two seater with hootie, motherfucker

A Letter

The police are not your friend. The police are not your enemy. The same could be said about the law. So let's say it. The law is not your friend and the law is not your enemy. So what are the police then if they are not friends nor enemies. Well let's get a definition of the word 'Police' from the dictionary: "the civil force of a national or local government, responsible for the prevention and detection of crime and the maintenance of public order." And while we're at it lets get a dictionary definition of 'Law' as well: "the system of rules that a particular country or community recognizes as regulating the actions of its members and may enforce by the imposition of penalties." Nowhere in the definition does it say "friend" or "enemy" even though some police officers can be friendly and some can be really antagonistic (see the famed "Good Cop/Bad Cop" routine for an explicit example) it is not the nature of their position in society to be friend or foe. So what are the police then? The firmest designation for the police is their primary title "Law Enforcement Officer" and again the law is neither your friend or foe so then the police are a merely reflection of the law. Police are the physical manifestation of the law. The police occupy a middle ground of sorts. They are mostly benign in the sense that if they have no particular law to enforce then they are powerless. Also where the law is broken and can't be seen or is out of the conscious knowledge of the police they are also powerless as is the law itself. Law is only powerful when it comes into direct contact with its child, Criminality. Crime and our relationship to crime is much closer to us than our relationship to the law. Everybody bends or breaks the law in some very minute capacity. We may speed on the highway from time to time. Throw litter on the ground. Lie on our taxes. Disregard a jury duty summons. Download pirated content. Where we feel the law doesn't "count" or "make sense" we are inclined to transgress the limits. Furthermore Crime is celebrated in all annals of entertainment and culture. In movies and books and song and TV. When was the last time you heard a song on the radio about the fabulous and sexy lifestyles of being a cop? In movies and TV it is much different as police officers are portrayed as being heroic figures but how many times within those same films or TV shows a police officer goes "outside" the law to rectify some injustice or solve some crime. How many movie cops had to "give up their badge" to the captain because they broke the rules to catch the bad guy? In effect they had to become criminals to enforce to the law. Think of Batman. Commissioner Gordon uses him when things get a little too out of hand in Gotham City and he needs somebody who isn't bound to the letter of the law and all that that entails to deal with the villainous hordes. This maybe "fictional" but then again is it really? How many real life cops put guns and drugs on people to get an arrest possibly on people who they know for a fact are committing serious crimes but can't prove it? How many cops "invent" a probable cause to effect a search of someone's property and eventually "find what they were looking for" even though what they found was not the initial reason they stopped the person? How many cops beat confessions out of people? How many cops flat out lie when it comes to what they saw or did during arrests and follow up investigations? How many cops have used terroristic threats to get people to comply to testifying or admitting to things they didn't commit? How many cops work for the same criminals they are employed to pursue in the forms of bribes and information? But then how many citizens do the same exact things? "Police Officer" and "Law Enforcement Officer" are just titles, roles, positions, names. No different than "typewriter" or "car." What gives these things life are the people that use them. Some people just do not know how to type or drive and it must be said that some people just don't know how to be police officers in strict accordance with the law. One problem is that becoming a police officer or law enforcement officer is a very structured and ordered bureaucratic process. It is very rigid and rather systematic. It is literally uniformed to stand as the visible and physical counterpoint to the non-uniformed wildness that is on the one smaller end, society itself and on the other larger end, criminality. Crime is subtle and blends well into the wild variety of society. Crime is successful because it is asymmetric and forever evolving. It can go unnoticed. Hence why the most successful police operations are done "undercover" and the most visible criminal activities are the least successful. The ability to blend into the "wildness" of society and mimic it is the best tactic for success outside of pure anarchy. Crime is highly adaptable. It is highly revered because its heroes have excellent leadership qualities and in some cases very deep philanthropic sentiments. Crime is the true equal opportunity employer and is one of the only organizations to successfully overcome the racial divides. Criminals are the embodiment of the material American Dream. Freedom (even from taxation!), upward mobility and the pursuit of happiness. All crimes have victims but one could say quite successfully that all things have victims. In the business world, victims are classified under the term externalities. For example, some people call perfectly legal mountain top removal coal mining a crime against humanity as it has the potential to build up then completely destroy entire communities not to mention the sometimes irreversible environmental externalities. Laws sometimes have a weird way of creating their own criminal enemies, hence the "child" term used earlier. Take for instance prohibition, it was a perfectly sound moral concept to combat what was seen by some as the scourge of drunkenness and all its hideous social and moral externalities, just imagine drunk driving back in the 20's! This perfectly sound moral law however single handedly created the mafia, the worlds greatest and most successful organized criminal enterprise. The emergence of the mafia lead to the creation of the FBI which was needed to be a "higher" form of law enforcement to combat the mob. The FBI tactics included all sorts of law bending and law creation to try and successfully tackle the problem the same government that employed them unwittingly created in the first place. The cultural impact of the mafia was instantaneous and deep even up to this day. For example, we all know off top who Al Capone was but would struggle to find out who the president of the United States was during the time Al Capone was alive. And without Google today I'd say some of us would probably never know or even care to find out. The legal limits were stretched to the fight the mafia then and they are still being stretched to this day to justify your parking ticket or your "failure to signal." So what does all this mean? Is it right? Is it wrong? Is it fair? Is there a solution? Unfortunately and fortunately there is no one solution. Law enforcement and criminality are like hand and glove. They are forever connected and as long as you have one you'll have the other and all the externalities from both sides that come along with them. Abuse of authority by authority will be balanced somewhere on the other side by abuse of the system by criminality. Freddy Grey dies unjustly in police custody on one side and El Chapo escapes from prison on the other side. An eye for and eye to be biblical about it. One hard solution to swallow for many is to just obey the law. Buuuuuut this "simple" solution also can create a set of dubious illegitimate children of its own because the law inextricably represents much more than its face value of "do not do and you will not be punished" for some "obey" is equated to "starve" or "go without" or "be poor" or "be insulted" or "be bored" or "be trapped in a vicious circle of economic and academically induced depression simply because I lost the biological lottery of life and was born into a family of second or third class citizens at a time and place where social status is dictated by race which also dictates access to the apparatuses of upward mobility etc etc etc..." Sometimes "obey" explicitly means die. This is the root of the plague of vendetta that is sweeping through Chicago. The ever viral and ever rational and true "Kill Or Be Killed" mentality. For some "obey" MEANS "punishment." This misunderstanding of metaphorical process when it comes to how we refer, frame and live through the narratives of our individual lives is what causes much of the conflict. Objective law has little wiggle room for subjective reality. What "law enforcement officer" means in a dictionary and the courts can be far from the definition that it has on the streets and in practice. Police officers can be defined on the streets as surely protecting and serving but protecting and serving the wills of a corrupt authoritative system that if allowed to have its way will mean poverty forever and access denied ad infinitum. Police officers must be trained to assess not only the dangers of a situation but also the desperation of a situation. Is it just a coincidence that a synonym for criminal is "Desperado"? Law Enforcement has to become much more in tune and educated with the needs (material, PSYCHOLOGICAL, spiritual and cognitive) of the communities it is tasked with patrolling and if they are unable or unwilling to take on the entire scope of their position then they should find work elsewhere. Most police will respond to this by saying that such a comprehensive approach is not in there job description and will have little to no effect on the streets. One must then in reply confront them with the nature of law itself. Law is connected to the mentalities of man. It seeks to control or less invasively patrol the passions and actions of man which stem directly from his mind. And if you cannot fully comprehend the mind of a man as an externality of the environment in which he inhabits then how can you fully understand the mechanics of law itself? Again Law and the mind are like hand and glove. Some cops will say that it is for the courts to decide. However, one must argue back plainly that judges, prison guards and prosecutors don't walk the streets or patrol the beats and they rely on and TRUST police officers and their presupposed understanding of the law to bring cases before them that only meet or exceed the requirements set out by the law. That is why POLICE OFFICERS HAVE TO TESTIFY IN COURT because they are considered to be expert witnesses in terms of criminal justice and are expected to expose the very fine details of active criminality that a DA stuck in an office or a judge stuck behind a bench does not have the time nor mental hard drive space to process thoroughly. Be clear on two things: This is not meant to be a belittling or a rebuke of the police or the letter and spirit of the law. I have 3 siblings with long careers in law enforcement as police officers, correctional officers and sheriffs. This is also not an approval of criminality. I have exponentially many more family and friend who have been involved in the world of crime and it is nothing to brag about or applaud as a successful life to lead. Most of the time it has ended in death or prison or both. Both these institutions are reflections of the human condition and our understandings and misunderstandings of the way the world is "supposed" to work. The death of Sandra Bland is the perfect example of when these two amorphous and wandering institutions get it all the way wrong. Sandra perceived the law enforcement officer to be a law enforcement officer and all that that entails in control of his emotions and strictly subservient to the rule of law when in fact he retreated to criminality and reverted to lawlessness to prosecute what he perceived to be a disrespectful criminal threat in Sandra as opposed to her being a law abiding but pressurized citizen questioning the lawfulness of her stop. Her death in jail is a reflection of the misunderstanding of the mental pressure even the tiniest amount of perceived injustice can do to a person. While I hesitate to judge her cause of death I feel comfortable in saying that if it was suicide it speaks to the depth of the belief we as humans have in right and wrong. Sometimes people would rather die than face the injustices of this world and it doesn't need to be years or decades to decay someone to such a state it can take hours or days. Even seconds. The direct connection between The Law and The Mind is something that needs to taken very seriously by not only police officers but also by the rank and file citizen. The FULL scope of Law and Law Enforcement and Criminality and what effects they all have on the already overly sensitized and tandemically overly desensitized psyches of the communities they inhabit needs to become a dominant issue in culture. So while law enforcement officers may by definition not be our "friends" it might be time that they damn well think about becoming them or at least stray from acting as our enemies. And it might do us well to accept them as "friends" if they honestly extend the offer and not make ourselves enemies to them based on what we see in the trending multimediums as "Brand Cop." Otherwise we together run the risk of giving birth to a new child, one that will feed not on milk but instead off the flesh and blood of its parents.

I was like stop the music, and let the motherfuckers know
That DMX is in this building!

[DJ Envy]
Let me tell you about DMX
DMX is probably, one of the artists that saved Def Jam back in the day
When Def Jam was going down
And-and he saved Def Jam with the, with the cruddy raps
But let me tell you how generous DMX was (Okay)
This is when I was producing
DMX flew me down to uh, L.A. (uh-huh) when he was shooting a movie
And uh, we did about four or five tracks
But the reason I knew DMX was so big
Is in the middle of the movie he stopped filming
And was like "Envy, let's go, uhh, fly helicopters." (ha ha ha)
And we went to the store, we bought remote control helicopters
And started flying helicopters in the middle of the set!

[Chorus]
Ryde or die, right or wrong

I been doin this for a minute
So with or without you I'ma get it, cause I'm in it to win it

Stepped in dirt, changed my shoes
Got those dirty, asked God for a new pair
And He musta heard me; thought I was worthy
Taught me to listen cause in New York
The rule is the more you know the less you talk
So if you fake niggas actin like you down for the kid
When it goes back, don't be around for shit
That's why niggas like you get found in a ditch
You ain't built for war, actin like a bitch

Ryde or die, right or wrong
Niggas wit'cha by your side 'til the storm
Then they split, don't wanna ride to the storm

Like they gon' ride 'til the end
Cause soon as you hit a bump niggas jump ship
But when it's all good same niggas suck dick
Money is the root of all evil
I ain't a fake nigga, and never had a reason to deceive you
Don't nobody do for me, but me
A nigga gon' be alright, you'll see
When I need a friend, God sends me one
When I need some ends, he saved me some
Whatever I need I get it, so I don't want for nothin
And I ain't gotta hunt for nothin
Sittin on ten whips, a few chips
And that mayne with the laser from the hip catch you slip

[Chorus]
Ryde or die, right or wrong
Niggas wit'cha by your side 'til the storm
Then they split, don't wanna ride to the storm
(I love you my nigga)

[Verse]
On flow when I'm killing them
I'm floating off weed
It's dope, then you know that it's me
The rest, you don't deal with them
I travel the world, three-hundred and sixty degrees
These hoes get adrenaline
They come to my crib see all the TV's
On the walls in the room that I'm living in
Why I got all these women friends?
Cause I'm spending Benjamins
I hope y'all don't break up
Cause if y'all don't make up
Then I'll be the nigga to get revenge
No, I ain't basic, she diggin' my style
Loving the way that I'm living so wild
Loving the way that I'm putting it down
Loving the way that I'm making her smile
Like had no really good dick in a minute, that's making her wild
And I'm the nigga that's with it
I'll start it and finish it
I'm with a broad that be tryna be innocent
I roll a joint she could probably hit it
Y'all will go broke in a matter of minutes
Ain't about the love, it's about the digits
See all this money in front of me?
Young nigga gotta get it
Taylor Gang

[Verse 1]
It's not your bubble I'm bursting
But soon a penny's gonna drop
Every time we're conversing
I see your head about to pop

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm looking at you, don't like what I see
You need to touch ground 'til you're level with me
So you better hold it, hold it down, down
This is bigger than you, it's bigger than me
You're stringing it out like a symphony
So you better hold it, hold it down, down, down

[Chorus]
This ain't the me show, keep it on the low
Where's your superego?
You let your head grow, I tried to let you know
When I tell you how it is, you don't like it
You don't like it, you don't like it
I tell you how it is, you don't like it
You don't like it, you don't like it
I tell you how it is, you don't like it
So where's your superego?

[Verse 2]
You're my girl, so it's worth it
I'm gonna hit you with the truth
In this world no one's perfect
We're all consumed by what we do

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm looking at you, don't like what I see
You need to touch ground and get level with me
So you better hold it, hold it down, down
This is bigger than you, it's bigger than me
You're stringing it out like a symphony
So you better hold it, hold it down, down, down, down

[Chorus]
This ain't the me show, keep it on the low
Where's your superego?
You let your head grow, I tried to let you know
When I tell you how it is, you don't like it
You don't like it, you don't like it
I tell you how it is, you don't like it
You don't like it, you don't like it
I tell you how it is, you don't like it
So where's your superego?

[Bridge]
You've lost a part of your mind
A part that's hard to define
I'm tryna help you with your superego
You've lost a part of your mind
A part that's hard to define
I'm tryna help you with your superego

[Chorus]
This ain't the me show, keep it on the low
Where's your superego?
You let your head grow, I tried to let you know
When I tell you how it is, you don't like it
You don't like it, you don't like it
I tell you how it is, you don't like it
You don't like it, you don't like it
I tell you how it is, you don't like it
So where's your superego?

[Verse 1 - Disclosure (Ft. Kwabs)]
Don't say you want me, don't say you need me
If you ain't ready, turn around
Willing and able, cards on the table
And I believe in what we've found

[Pre-Chorus - Disclosure (Ft. Kwabs)]
If we can't trust the love in us
There'll be no looking back, no looking back, no
If there's enough, in stuff we touch
There'll be no looking back, no looking back, no

[Chorus - Disclosure (Ft. Kwabs)]
If we're falling in love, we're falling in love
There'll be nothing above
And I won't give you up, no I won't give you up
If we're falling in love
If we're falling in love, we're falling in love
There'll be nothing above
And I won't give you up, no I won't give you up
If we're falling in love

[Verse 2 - Disclosure (Ft. Kwabs)]
If you don't feel it, the same as me
Speak now or hold your peace
If you don't see it, the way I see
Then it was never meant to be

[Pre-Chorus - Disclosure (Ft. Kwabs)]
If we can't trust the love in us
There'll be no looking back, no looking back, no
If there's enough, in stuff we touch
There'll be no looking back, no looking back, no

If I'm gonna fall in, I'm gonna fall my all in
If I'm gonna fall in, I'm gonna fall my all in
If I'm gonna fall in, I'm gonna fall my all in
If I'm gonna fall in, I'm gonna fall my all in
If I'm gonna fall in, I'm gonna fall my all in
If I'm gonna fall in, I'm gonna fall my all in
If I'm gonna fall in, I'm gonna fall my all in
If I'm gonna fall in, I'm gonna fall my all in

[Verse 1]
I might go losing it and drive off of a cliff
Fall in the void
And if I blow my brains out all over the scene
That's madness curing sadness
These walls ain't talking back, might as well finally paint them black
I'm out of ideas
The ceiling is all I have, downward from here
I'm ripping apart

[Pre-Chorus]
Who am I? Who are we?
Who am I? Who are we?
All I want is to feel complete
Who am I? Who are we?

[Chorus]
Confused, truth is what I choose
Heal I never do
Asking, "Who are you?"
I don't have one clue
Seems I hate him, too
Seems my color's blue
Who?

[Verse 2]
I always end up back in a cycle of shame
Looking in the mirror is hard
Some days, I hurt myself to distract me from distraction
That's madness fixing sadness
Go on adventures to find that the answers aren't plain
But there's comfort in tears
Decoding my sacred heart, flying from here
No more falling apart, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
Who am I? Who are we?
Who am I? Who are we?
All I want is to feel complete
Who am I? Who are we?

[Bridge]
I hate the drugs, but I love the numb
I hate the gun, but I want the sun
I hate the drugs, but I love the numb
I hate the gun, but I want the sun

[Chorus]
Confused, truth is what I choose (Truth is what I choose)
Heal I never do (Heal, I never do)
Asking, "Who are you?" (Asking, "Who are you?")
I don't have one clue (I don't have one clue)
Seems I hate him, too (Seems I hate him, too)
Seems my color's blue, ooh
Who?

[Bridge]
I hate the drugs, but I love the numb
I hate the gun, but I want the sun
I hate the drugs, but I love the numb
I hate the gun, but I want the sun

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Listen, this is my evaluation
This shit oversaturated, y'all can get evacuated
Kids sippin' Actavis and they ain't even activated
Married to the Internet, stuck in place, salivatin'
Ain't nobody graduatin'
Don't nobody love this shit the way I love it
That's why I gotta hate it
Everybody out for fame, that ain't no exaggeration
Damn, I'm gettin' aggravated
Fuck, I'm gettin' agitated
Teachers so underpaid in these fuckin' schools
The police got our name in all they databases
Girls be thirteen actin' twenty-two
Niggas be forty-four actin' half they ages
Somebody tell me, what the fuck is goin' on?
These niggas in tight shit, I'm in the fuckin' Matrix
It's lookin' like a sign of the revelation
'Bout time of the return of the fuckin' greatest
I got all these patients, man
How come they ain't patient with me?
They just think I want the money
Why? When I can't take it with me
Y'all don't do it for the love, for the love not
They gon' find out who you are
Just admit it 'fore you get admitted

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]
Say, what you livin' about? (Fuck you gon' tell me?)
Do you remember where you started out though?
You're lookin' lost now (You want a pass? Oh, damn!)
Fake it 'til you make it, take your little paper
But when you look in the mirror your credibility’s gone now
I'd rather be hated on for who I am
Than to be loved for who I'm not, that's word to Doc

[Chorus: Candice Pillay]
Fame and fortune is not your forte
Fuck the world now, I'm done with foreplay
Doctor's orders: go fuck yourself
Take two of these in the mornin', overdose and kill yourself

[Verse 2: Eminem & Candice Pillay]
In the beginning a few of the people who had a problem I was this good scoffed, I just shook off
Prob'ly reminded you of the first time you saw Tiger Woods golf
Never thought about how much my race and nationality meant
But based on how I ascended
See how plain it was now, they want me to jet
But no one really gave a fuck about my descent, 'til I took off
Mistook me because I looked soft
But I stood tall, I just followed the Doctor's orders
So I rose and grew balls, told these hoes to screw off
Decided opposing you is what I'm ‘posed to do, all's
I did was say what I'm feeling when the vocal booth calls
And had you on pins and needles when I spoke to you all
You felt my pain, it's almost like I poked voodoo dolls
And I hope my spirit haunts the studios when I'm gone
My picture jumps off a poster and just floats through the halls
And fuckin' goes through the walls like the ghost of Lou Rawls
Karma's headed for Armageddon
The drama setter, I'm going in, already got an arm and head in
Whoever said words are just words ain't heard me word 'em
I give a fuck if my image even ends up taking a personal hit
Whoever I hurt or whatever bridges I burned in this bitch
And whatever bitches feel like they didn't deserve what they get
And whatever consequences come with every verse
It's worth it, so Doc, turn the beat on
Whose turn is it to get murdered on it?
And here's to all the years I spent toein' a line to overtime
As sure as a mole is blind
In my mind I'm still underground as a groundhog
And I'ma go for mine, like a whole furrow just tryna dig up some gold and diamonds and coal to find
No signs of slowin', these lines are my 9's
I just load up the most rhymes and open fire with a closed mind
All I needed was someone to co-sign
Been a Doctor's assault rifle
With the sniper scope for this whole time
Day one, say when to blast, just give me the order, I spray (uh)
Pain in the ass, you'll get shot in the ass with a paint gun
Ain't no one safe from, non-believers there ain't none
I even make the bitches I rape cum
I'm waitin' on someone to say somethin'
Dre, make the bass pump!
And let the tape run for old time's sake!
I spit it straight through, this is take one
The moment you're waitin' for has come, but the—

[Chorus: Candice Pillay]
Fame and fortune is not your forte
Fuck the world now, I'm done with foreplay
Doctor's orders: go fuck yourself
Take two of these in the mornin', overdose and kill yourself
Doctor's orders, Doctor's orders

[Outro: Anderson .Paak]
Ah, fuck!

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Stuck in the middle of my past and my future
It's stuck in between us, tryna give love another try
But it's tripping me up 'cause I'd rather go on and be lonely
Damn it, I give up, so I'll be gone with the wind, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you gotta let me go
'Cause you never help me when I fall down, fall face down (Ow!)

[Chorus]
I'm far away 'cause you bring me down like gravity
I just gotta run away
I need space, it's hard for me to break away from you
It's hard for me to get away from you

[Post-Chorus]
It's hard for me to get away, hard, hard, hard
It's hard for me to run away, hard, hard, hard
It's hard for me to get away

[Verse 2]
Feeling lost, back and forth, traveling on this bumpy road
Can you please listen to me? I don't need the games, girl, I want out
The middle of the street, on my knees and the traffic on the highway
I used to believe you were good for me, my life's turning upside down

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you gotta let me go
'Cause you never help me when I fall down, fall face down (Ow!)

[Chorus]
I'm far away 'cause you bring me down like gravity
I just gotta run away
I need space, it's hard for me to break away from you
It's hard for me to get away from you

[Post-Chorus]
It's hard for me to get away, hard, hard, hard
It's hard for me to run away, hard, hard, hard
It's hard for me to get away from you

[Bridge]
Now I'm falling faster, your love's my disaster
Let me live, I can't take this anymore (Oh, woah)
Now I'm falling faster, your love's my disaster
Let me live, oh, woah

[Chorus]
I'm far away (Yeah) 'cause you bring me down like gravity
I just gotta run away
I need space (Yeah yeah, yeah yeah), it's hard for me to break away from you
It's hard for me to get away from you

[Post-Chorus]
It's hard for me to get away
It's hard for me to run away, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's hard for me to get away from you
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh woah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Oh no, it's hard for me to get away from you
Oh-oh-oh-oh
It's hard for me to get away
It's hard for me to run away
It's hard for me to get away

Stone-cold killers in these Compton streets
One hand on the 9, all eyes on me
Murder, murder
Murder, murder, ha
Call 9-1-1, emergency
Hands up in the air for the world to see
It's murder, it's murder
Murder, murder (Murder)

[Bridge: Candice Pillay]
Murda dem down, kill 'em dead (Yo!)
Bullet to the dome, to the head
Murda dem down, kill a yout'
Don fi pull up on di man and
(Turn me up!) What it look like?
See, murda dem down, kill 'em dead (Yo!)
Bullets come down from the air
Murda dem down, kill a yout'
Don fi pull up on di man and
(Turn me up!) What it look?

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]
There's the stone cold killers in these Compton streets
One hand on the 9, all eyes on me
Murder, murder
It's murder, it's murder
Call 9-1-1, emergency
Hands up in the air for the world to see
It's murder, it's murder
Murder, murder (Murder)
It's been a 187 in this bitch!

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Murder this, murder listen, hear that Suburban whippin'?
Tinted windows, right at your wifey (Brrrat!)
And I bet you miss her
Reload the Pro Tools and we throw the clip in both trays
That's one on the left and one in the right hand
Scottie Pippen, both ways
Been doin' drive-bys
Got this music industry timeline lookin' like Rosecrans
When these niggas throw up them signs high
I'm talking about that bottom, where it's high crimes
Shit, I’m just tryna get paid and keep them thighs high (Thighs high)
Sometimes, I feel like I could just bury ‘em, bury 'em
Cause delirium, mass hysteria, no scarier area
I'm very aware hip-hop needed something to carry it
So I married that bitch and swung down in that chariot
And you way too fuckin' close, beware the barrier
This is Hub City, nigga, don't make us embarrass you
Man, you should be realistic, these niggas 'round here ballistic
We did the numbers, and you looking like another statistic

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]
There's the stone-cold killers in these Compton streets
One hand on the 9, all eyes on me
Murder, murder
It's murder, it's murder
Call 9-1-1, emergency
Hands up in the air for the world to see
It's murder, it's murder
Murder, murder (Murder)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
(Ahh, shit!) Recognize what live inside these eyes
I'ma ride until the dead has risen
Live in a project building, dodging the module ceilings
I ride, I'ma ride in a stolen Jeep
Ride with the eyes of five blind men, my vision (Corrupted)
Mama tried counseling, five plans for Kendrick (But fuck it)
My family ties had sabotaged Rosecrans existence (Abducted)
My aliens on surveillance, they paid me a visit (Disgusting)
Our stadium's packed, Raiders in black
Curls dripping, silver bullet, palladium in my strap
I lie on the side of a one-way street (Blow-blow-blow-blow!)
Nowhere to go, death all I can see (Blow-blow-blow-blow!)
I say "Fuck is up?" I fuck 'em up
Your supper's up, and something's up
I hope he no can walk the tightest rope before the double-dutch
Broke plenty records with this weapon, I protect it under oath
My discretion, fuck your blessing, fuck your life, fuck your hope
Fuck your mama. fuck your daddy, fuck your dead homie
Fucked the world up when we came up, that's Compton, homie!

[Bridge: Sly Pyper]
Murder, murder
Murder... murder
It's all murder... murder
Ahh!

[Outro: Sly Pyper]
Murder, murder
Murder, murder
It's been a 187 in this bitch!

[Intro: Dr. Dre]
Family problems, it ain't easy handling those needs
(Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do)
Baby mama drama, I just need a little time to go to sleep
(Damn, only if I had a little time for me)
Record company motherfuckers asking me when I'm gonna release
(I'm under pressure homie, so much pressure on me)
And my homies on my back
About me helping them get up off them streets
(I mean what the fuck?)

[Hook: Justus & (BJ The Chicago Kid)]
And it all falls back on me
(I said it all falls down)
Sometimes, somehow, it all falls back on me
(Somehow it always fall back on me)
No matter where we are, no matter what we doing, it's on me
(No matter where we are it's on me)
If it was up to you that's just the way it's always gon' be
(Listen to me)

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
It's kind of funny how they fall back on me
I used to never get a call back, homie
Before the money they didn't see me
Like it's dark and it's all black, homie
But now they switching cause the card black, homie
It wasn't always that way, we was recording on the 4-track, homie
New apartment, no fridge, no mattress, no table, no cable
And all I hear is my girl in my ear
And this nigga Eazy asking for his car back, homie
I would've never saw this happening from that far back, homie
What it came to be, would have never believed
Living the life I lived in C-P-T
A motherfucking dream to reality is what you call that, homie
Yeah, it was something to me
No eat, no sleep, wasn't nothing to me
Can't always be how you want it to be
And I'm the one that they looking up to
Fuck they expecting from me?

[Hook: Justus & (BJ The Chicago Kid)]
And it all falls back on me
(I said it all falls down)
Sometimes, somehow, it all falls back on me
(Somehow it always fall back on me)
No matter where we are, no matter what we doing, it's on me
(No matter where we are it's on me)
If it was up to you that's just the way it's always gon' be
(Listen to me)

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
That's just the way it is, and how it always was
DJing parties in my neighborhood just for the love
Dope dealers overtipping and bitches stripping
And any minute niggas'll start tripping and start shooting shit
On any given day I'm like "what the fuck?"
Face down on the pavement with the billy clubs
Took that feeling to the studio and cued it up
And now it's "Fuck the Police" all up in the club
Now it's '91 and Snoop Dogg came to visit and was like
"What up cuz? Let me show you what this chronic like"
Couldn't help myself, just had to dip into that chronic life
And then that night came in when that nigga Knight came in
(Woo!) This one of those dreams you don't wake up from
Then again, you don't sleep if you come from where I come from
Where the sun shines and they bust nines, no 9 plus 1-1
When they run up on your school bus with a tool tucked
You might learn something

[Hook: Justus & (BJ The Chicago Kid)]
And it all falls back on me
Somehow, it all falls back on me
No matter where we are, no matter what we doing, it's on me
If it was up to you that's just the way it's always gon' be

[Intro: Jimmy Iovine]
Fear. Fear's a powerful thing. I mean, it's got a lot of firepower. If you can figure out a way to wrestle that fear to push you from behind rather than to stand in front of you, that's very powerful. I always felt that I had to work harder than the next guy, just to do as well as the next guy. And to do better than the next guy, I had to just kill. And uh, you know, to a certain extent, that's still with me in how I work, you know, I just go in

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
Sittin' 'bout a hundred stories up, like what the fuck?
And I'm just lookin' at it all
I'll be right here in Los Angeles, lookin' like a villain layin' low
Nothin' I can do but pack it all up
Goin' up, but shit, I feel the love
Spotlight on me and I'm feelin' so rare tonight, huh
Actin' a fool and feelin' alive
I'm fuckin' flawless like I live in a vault

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]
Only type of livin' I know
(Only type of living I, only type of living I)
Yeah, see, if it was you, you would've killed yourself by now
(Only type of living I, only type of living I know)
It takes a special kind of mothafucka to live like this
(Only type of living I)
And they ask me how I do it
(Only type of living I know)
Mothafucka, just take a look around

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre & Anderson Paak]
Best believe I'm in the buildin'
Ha, I hear you mothafuckas talkin' and all that, but uh
No, no, don't mention me at all
Yeah, comin' live and direct
And I know you feelin' some type of way about it, but uh
Watch your mouth, I dare your ass to say somethin'
I thought it was all good (Hey)
But now you mothafuckas crossed the line and
Kinda pissin' me off
All the fans and all the fame
And though I gave everything to this game, they still complain
Now what the fuck do y'all expect me to do?
There's just so much fuckin' pressure
There's so much pressure
And it's all in a day's work

[Bridge: Marsha Ambrosius]
Work, hard
Workin' so hard
24/7, 3-6-5
365, hard work
It's all in a day's work

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre + Anderson .Paak]
My whole life, all I ever thought about is grindin'
Even though my surroundings only showed me crime and violence
That was back when a rapper needed guns way more than a stylist
And that was back when I felt like
Rappers was true mothafuckin' riders
Or even back in the day when I was a fuckin' youngster, man
Shit, I was still sayin', "Fuck the police"
(Man, fuck the police)
Born and raised in the belly of the beast
(Mothafuckin' Hub City)
I had a dream that we was at peace
But I was so wrong, so wrong
Y'all too wrapped up in the bullshit and bias
Now reality TV is talking 'bout pulpits and choirs
Some of these hoes give less than a fuck
When they runnin' their life story by us
It's the worst when I'm in a hotel, like a Hilton, sick and tired
And some of these housewives way too fuckin' desperate
These bitches thinkin' fame first
I can't knock the hustle, shit, it's (All in a day's work)
But that's that shit with potential to make the game worse
Shit, it's just somethin' about that Hollywood curse
They just thirsty

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Hard times
I double my grind, fuck the part-time, huh
Stay ready for war, I'm on the front line
I'm gettin' the feelin' like it's all mine
It's becoming the only feeling I know
(Only type of livin' I) Only type of livin' I know
(Only type of livin' I) Only type of livin' I know
(Only type of livin' I) Only type of livin' I know
(Only type of livin' I know)

[Interlude]
Gonna go to work
We gotta work
We gotta work
Let's get back to work
On the grind, back to work
Let's work

[Verse 4: Dr. Dre & Anderson .Paak]
Rich as fuck, but, guess what?
I'm back to work (Yeah, I'm back to work)
Overseas, back home, no time to sleep
I'm back to work (Huh, I'm back to work)
So many people that I love, they want my time
But I got to work (I'm sorrry, I'm back to work)
Some of my friends don't understand, shit
I got to work (Huh, I'm back to work)
Always talkin' 'bout bustin' the club
But I'm like, "Fuck that, I gotta work" (Fuck that, I'm workin')
If you really wanna do it like this, shit
You better get back to work (I'm workin', huh)
Back to work, right back to work (Right back to work)
Gotta get back to work (Right back to work)
Shit, right back to work (Right back to work, huh)

[Intro: Dr. Dre]
All my life, I've been down to ride
So I kept it real and I stayed alive with no compromise
And I fantasize about the baddest bitch and what between her thighs
Then I woke up and realized this is my motherfuckin' real life

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
You know where the fuck I'm from
From that muthafuckin' legendary
From the city where them niggas load clips in fast
And get stabbed at homeroom should've skipped that class
Shit will never change on the West Side
Jack your shit, take your car for a test drive (Ah shit)
Gangbangin' out the window hollering let's ride
Gotta keep a tec by the bedside
These niggas don't know my life
All this pain and what I sacrificed
And all my niggas that lost their life
You never die, you never die
I'm in that motherfuckin' one for a minute now
All y'all lil' niggas need to simmer down
Shut the fuck up, I'm the one that's killing now
Take a look who on top of the pinnacle

[Verse 2: Cold 187um]
Cold 187um
Know it's been a minute since you heard from us
Still we're untouchable murderers
R.I.P to KMG, I still got a murder rap
And don't give a fuck where the body at
You do too much talkin' I walk in the building
I just give a fuck where the money at
I'm Jordan and Jackson, the coach and the player
They trust me it's only just one of them
I'm callin' them shots and makin' the plays
If you get a trade, better fuck with him
I keep it gangsta, y'all testin' my patience
Got me feelin' so anxious, I be lookin' so facetious
Feel like running a caper

[Interlude: Xzibit & Dr. Dre]
Wait, hold up I got next! What up, X?

[Verse 3: Xzibit, Anderson .Paak, & Ice Cube]
Spent my birthday in Dubai
Skyrise surprise and I'm dressed like a spy
Black tux, on you fucks
And guess what? I'm ready to (blow, yo, oh no)
I hang that 6-2 sideways
Pissin' off the neighbors, scrapin', bumpin' in the driveway
Cube gave me the pistol
Told me to kill at will and (blow, yo, oh no)
(I couldn't give a fuck) Literally
Cashed out just livin' to me
Blast it like a Kennedy beat
Wanna get rid of 'em? Send them to me
While I'm just over here cozy holdin' these double D's
She book smart with pornographic abilities
Well I ,don't know what you know, but I know
I got that shit!
These motherfuckers still talking? Fuck 'em!
That's why they bring X and the guillotine out
To stop these bitch niggas from runnin' their mouth
It's bout time somebody said something

[Verse 4: Sly Pyper]
One in the glove, one in the clip, one in the chamber
One on the dash, one in the stash, ready for danger
I'm ready to die, I can't control this fuckin' anger
Ah shit, somebody better fuckin' stop me
Cause I'm a loose cannon that can't stand myself
I'm bad for my own health
You niggas really think I give a fuck about somebody else
(Fuck 'em!)
I swear to God, I'mma do it, back the fuck up, I'mma do it
I swear to God, I'mma lose it

[Outro]
Baby, baby! What the fuck are you doing? Put the gun down! Really? Are you doin' this shit to me again?
Oh my God
You is so fucked up for this
Fuck It
*Gun cocks*
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Okay, I'm sorry! What the fuck? Don't point the fuckin' gun at me! Okay, put the fuckin' gun down! No, no, no, no!!
*Gun shot*
Alright, I got the legs
Man this bitch is heavy
You gotta get under her armpits, man
Shut the fuck up, I got it
What the, what the fuck did you guys do?
It was this nigga
Me?
Shit, matter of fact you know what? You gon' dig the fuckin' hole this time
I don't give a fuck, like it's the first fuckin' hole I ever dug
Who the fuck is that?
I don't know, ask fuckin' Charles Manson right here
Oh, oh, you're tryna be funny? You're really fuckin' tryna be funny right now?
Shh, shh, shut your ass up
This is bad. This is, this is fucking bad man. Fuck it, let's start digging

[Intro: Dr. Dre & Anderson .Paak]
Where you from, nigga?
(Help me!)

[Skit]
"What is going on in Compton? I don't understand it."
"Well as it relates to this, this is not in my field as the clerk so anything that relates to this, you'll probably have to get an answer from Dr. Dre."

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
I heard you talking about respect, I gave you niggas the utmost
All you niggas the utmost
Would you look over Picasso's shoulder
And tell him 'bout his brush strokes?
Them opinions, I don't trust those
I apologize, the city made a nigga so cutthroat
Every hood love me, but it started on one coast
Could've stopped in '86 but I knew that you would want more
I'm on the throne in a place some niggas won't go

[Chorus: Justus & Dr. Dre]
(Don't get it fucked up!) Been away from home
But I ain't been gone that long
(All they wanna know is: where you from? Where you from?
Where you from, nigga, huh? Compton!)

[Bridge: Dr. Dre]
Psst! This is about where I'm from
I think it's time to take these niggas to the deep water
Yeah, down in the Pacific (The Pacific), representin'
Where them sharks at, nigga, down in the deep water

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Listen, listen, listen, all you niggas swimming in the info
Go fuck around and drown in the specifics
Always going overboard, used to be my kinfolk
Now you sleeping with the motherfuckin' fishes
(Swimming with the mothefuckin' fishes, what the business?)
These niggas won't let up until they all wet up
(Don't get it fucked up!) Naw, nigga!
Now everybody wanna visit tryna re-up that prescription
(That prescription, yep, yeah, re-up)
That's my nigga, watercolors couldn't even paint the picture
If they don't get the picture, fuck them
Yeah, drugs by the dozen
You might just wanna go and check the children
(You might just wanna check your fuckin' children)
I'm the one that got they ear
Ah, for many years, I been making parents live in fear
I just wanna make it clear: My influence run deep like the ocean

[Chorus: Justus & Dr. Dre]
(Don't get it fucked up!) Been away from home
But I ain't been gone that long
(All they wanna know is: where you from? Where you from?
Where you from, nigga, huh? Compton!)

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]
Feels like you're drowning, don't you?
About a hundred miles down in that ocean
It's over, shoulda never jumped in
If you can't swim (If you can't swim, if you can't swim)
Oh my God, where's a lifeguard when you need one?

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Motherfucker know I started from the bottom, vodka baby bottle
Mixin' that with Similac, my momma knew I had a problem
Wasn't thinking 'bout no rapping, I was juuging for a dollar
Putting quarter pieces in the black Caprice and make it holla
No policing me, I got the beast in me, I gotta holla
Keep the decency and make them TNT my product
I'm a C-O-M-P-T-O-innovator, energizer
Inner city bullet flyin' 'til that bitch on auto pilot
Ah, shit! I don't give a fuck about your whereabouts
All I care about is wearing out your area
And airing out your upper body
When I catch ya walking out your parents' house
(Don't get it fucked up!) Homie got fucked up
Tryna park his tour bus, not knowing what's what
Or who's who, living in the L.A. County zoo
Pick them off like a big dog, motherfucker, woof!
Once upon a time, I shot a nigga on accident (Boom, boom, boom)
I tried to kill him but I guess I needed more practicing (Boom, boom, boom)
That's when I realized banging wasn't for everybody
Switch it up before my enemy or the sheriff got me
They liable to bury him, they nominated six to carry him
They worry him to death, but he no vegetarian
The beef is on his breath, inheriting the drama better than
A great white, nigga, this is life in my aquarium

[Chorus: Justus & Dr. Dre]
(Don't get it fucked up!) Been away from home
Been away from home all night long
(All they wanna know is: where you from?
Where you from, nigga, huh? Compton)

[Bridge: Cheyenne Lavene]
This is about where I'm from
I think it's time to take these niggas to the deep water
Yeah, down in the Pacific
Where them sharks at, nigga, down in the deep water

[Outro: Anderson .Paak]
Help me
(Feels like you're drowning)
I'm drowning
Help me, help me, help me
Somebody help me
(Shoulda never jumped in
If you, if you can't swim)
Help me
Help me, help me, help me
I can't, I can't breathe
I can't breathe, help
(Where's a lifeguard when you need one?)
God, please, please help me, please
Please help me, please help...
Please help, please, please...

It's beautiful outside
Looks like it's raining money, mane
It's beautiful outside
Looks like it's raining money, mane

[Verse 1: Jon Connor]
Say "What's up" to the broke nigga at the rich party (Woo!)
Who the fuck let this nigga in?
Do it look like I give a fuck? Sorry (Yeah!)
Looking at these hoes
And they gold-digger-gorgeous tryna get me (Woo!)
I run game on a bitch
In one Mississippi, two Mississippi (Yeah!)
Flint nigga in the spot
'til they pop one and the cops come like (Woo!)
Motherfuckers own a shotgun
Like a pop gun and they ready like (Yeah!)
Civic good nigga
I'm a Northside nigga 'til I'm gone (Woo!)
Do it for the ones in the hood
Like Connor gon' put the city on (Wait!)
Fuck that shit, nigga, fuck that shit, go
Live for my hood, look, this for my block
Ride for the hood, gotta spit it like Pac
I ain't got shit but I still feel good
Nigga can't take what a nigga don't got
Go hard in the paint, you can tell 'em post up
Homie in the hood like "Let me hold something"
Your man's in the hood talking all that shit
When they ran up on him, lil' buddy froze up
All they be talkin' but ain't saying nothing
Niggas be talking that ain't what they want
Ain't no fake shit around here
'Cause my nigga my city is really as real as the fuck
I be killing this shit, I ain't giving a fuck
You loving the bitch, she get hit in the truck
You think this sound crazy, that's how I grew up
So this for my people who still in the cut

[Chorus: Jill Scott]
Want that, need that
Root of all evil, mane, oh (get it, get it, I said)
I want that, need that
Root of all evil, mane, oh

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Say "What's up" to the nigga
Wearing all black at the white party (Woo!)
And I'm looking like I don't give a fuck
That's just how I get down, nigga, sorry (Yeah!)
And I'm looking like I don't play no games
Nah, nigga don't try me (Woo!)
Been that nigga that's spitting that
Paid dues like a motherfuckin' hobby (Yeah!)
If you're on that bullshit, nigga
Better fly that shit right by me (Woo!)
Came from the bottom of this bitch
And made it out of that shit and that's why we (Yeah!)
On top of this motherfuckin' world
Damn, look at that body (Woo!)
She come along with the territo
